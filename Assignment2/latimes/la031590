* "Mexicans are stupid and naturally lazy," Ruben Sierra remembers Anglo 
teachers saying when he was growing up in San Antonio. "You'll be lucky if you 
ever amount to much." 
</P>
<P>
Recently named dean at Valencia's California Institute of Arts School of 
Theatre after a national search, Sierra -- a playwright, actor and director -- 
helped found the Seattle Group Theatre in 1978 while earning a master's degree 
at the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The most exciting learning is where you're sharing," said Sierra, adding that 
he'll encourage students to take risks. "Say. . . 'Let's experiment. If it 
doesn't work, we'll find what does -- together.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Samuel Mark, who heads the USC office of civic and community relations, has 
been promoted to an assistant vice president at the campus. A native of Havana, 
Mark created the office of Hispanic programs in USC's College of Letters, Arts 
and Sciences. He is the editor of the Directory of the Hispanic Community of 
the County of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* Pediatrician Linda Velasquez's journey toward becoming a peace activist was 
an odyssey that taught her "to stop being a victim and to work for those 
victims of the arms race." 
</P>
<P>
This year Velasquez earned Immaculate Heart College Center's second annual 
Corita Kent Peace Award, honoring those "who, through their lives, words and 
actions, express the dream of life without war." 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez also expresses that dream through her work at the Edward Roybal 
Comprehensive Health Center in East Los Angeles, where she encourages parents 
to become involved in their children's education. "Parents appreciate someone 
taking the time to talk to them," she said. "Well-child care is more than 
making sure the baby is not dead." EDWARD J. BOYER

TIME FOR COUNTING;

<P>
ETHNIC GROUPS TOLD NOT TO FEAR THE CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Edith Hernandez remembers the fear and anxiety she felt when the U.S. census 
form arrived in her mail in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old native of El Salvador had been living illegally in Los Angeles 
for a year when she received the inquisitive census form. Immediately, she 
became suspicious. She thought it might be a new way for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to search out illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"All my family members warned me not to return the form," Hernandez recalled 
recently. At the time, she had been living with four brothers. "They said if I 
did return it, I would be sent back to El Salvador in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who became a legal resident in 1988, said if someone had told her in 
1980 that answers to the census are confidential, she would have completed the 
form. 
</P>
<P>
"All the information you give them is confidential. You don't have to worry," 
she said in Spanish. "It is important that Latinos are counted. The census . . 
. can force everyone to recognize us and give us the power we deserve, 
especially in politics." 
</P>
<P>
With 1990 census forms being mailed to 88 million U.S. households March 23, the 
city of Los Angeles, minority groups and the U.S. Census Bureau are heading 
campaigns to educate Latinos, blacks, Asians, American Indians and other 
traditionally under-represented groups about the importance of the decennial 
census count. 
</P>
<P>
Though the 1980 census was the best count ever of Latinos, the Census Bureau 
estimates that 7% of the Latino population in the United States was not 
counted. Latino groups say this undercount cost cities, counties and states 
millions of dollars in federal funds, which are distributed using census 
population figures. 
</P>
<P>
The groups also say a full count in 1980 would have increased the chances of 
raising Latino representation in government, since census population figures 
are used to apportion the 435 seats in the House of Representatives and for 
local and state redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Officials heading LA Counts!, a $600,000 census outreach project in the city of 
Los Angeles, say they are trying to prevent a similar scenario to the 1980 
count, when 4.6% of the general population and 7% of Latinos in Los Angeles 
were not counted. 
</P>
<P>
With various census outreach campaigns under way, the public is being bombarded 
with bilingual billboards, flyers, posters, buttons, balloons, bumper stickers 
and public service announcements on radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Vargas, of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said 
he hopes these campaigns will help combat the fear and ignorance that keep many 
Latinos from getting counted. Vargas, who is the national census director of 
the group, said his organization's aim is to motivate and inform. 
</P>
<P>
"People need to be told that they won't get into trouble if they answer the 
census," Vargas said. "They also need to understand that, though they won't see 
the benefits of a full count right away, there are benefits that will be seen 
in time. 
</P>
<P>
"The most obvious result of a full count of Hispanics is better political 
representation," Vargas added. "California may pick up four to six seats in 
(Congress). We also hope census figures can be used to determine where 
Hispanics are located and try to create districts where Hispanics can get 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
"An undercount of Hispanics will not affect just a Hispanic population, it will 
hurt everyone. We'll feel the undercount most severely in our public schools, 
where more than half the kids are Hispanics. We need to make sure all the 
children in the schools are counted because they mean money and resources for 
the school system. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal funding for transportation needs such as Metro Rail, highway and 
street repairs would also be affected by an undercount. Everyone uses the 
highways and the streets, so it's in everybody's best interest that we are all 
counted." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas' organization and other groups fought attempts to have illegal 
immigrants excluded from the census count. 
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution says that all must be counted," Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Perez of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, 
said undocumented Latinos are not the only ones who needlessly fear answering 
the census. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Latino immigrants come from countries where you can't trust the 
government," said Perez, the association's media coordinator in Los Angeles. 
"Other Latinos don't speak English. Some don't want their answers shared with 
welfare offices or the migra (the Immigration and Naturalization Service) or 
their landlords. These people's fears can be conquered by assuring them their 
answers to the census are completely confidential." 
</P>
<P>
John Reeder, director of the census regional office in Los Angeles, said the 
bureau hired seven bilingual workers in California to speak at churches, 
clinics and other community organizations about the importance and 
confidentiality of the census. So far, he said, the workers have succeeded in 
putting many fears to rest. 
</P>
<P>
"People trust a human being more than they trust a piece of paper," Reeder 
said. "And when they get both telling them it's confidential, people listen." 
</P>
<P>
People will have a choice of English or Spanish-language census questionnaires. 
But Vargas criticized the Census Bureau for requiring that people call a 
special telephone number to get the Spanish forms. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have sent out both English and Spanish language forms to all 
addresses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Reeder said sending both forms to every home would have been expensive and 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Census operators, in many cases, will refer callers to the 150 Questionnaire 
Assistance Centers scheduled to open in Los Angeles. The centers will be run by 
the regional census office and local voluntary community agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Reeder said one in six households will receive the census long form, which will 
take about 45 minutes to complete and ask more detailed questions. The form 
mailed to most homes will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. 
</P>
<P>
But, regardless of which document a house receives, all forms should be 
returned in their pre-addressed and pre-stamped envelopes by April 1, which is 
Census Day, or soon thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Starting April 25, about 7,000 enumerators will begin the laborious task of 
visiting the homes of people in Los Angeles who did not respond to the census. 
</P>
<P>
"We will send people out over and over again if necessary, until we get 
everyone to answer," Reeder said. 
</P>
<P>
The enumerators, who will wear name tags with the official census logo, will be 
assigned to the neighborhoods they know best. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau is expected to deliver the results of the count to President 
Bush on Dec. 31. The results will answer many questions about who lives in the 
United States -- from the median household income of Americans to the average 
number of bathrooms in an American home. 
</P>
<P>
George Malone, a supervising regional planner for Los Angeles County, said the 
1990 census is expected to show a 9% jump in Los Angeles County's Latino 
population -- from 27% in 1980 to 36%. The county also predicts the Asian and 
Pacific Islander population will increase from 7% in 1980 to 12.6%. Blacks are 
expected to make up 11% of the county's population in 1990, compared to 12.7% 
in 1980, and Anglos are expected to drop from 53.2% of the county's population 
in 1980 to 39.8% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FORMS IN SPANISH To receive the Spanish-language version of the census 
questionnaire, call toll-free (800) 283-6826. Spanish-speaking operators will 
be available from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week from March 23 to April 15.

LATINO PARENTS URGED TO VOICE SCHOOL CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One by one, loaded down with calendar planners, personal phone books and note 
pads, they huddle around their leader, Leticia Quezada, ready to talk shop: the 
education of their children. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three hours the 20 Latino parents from East Los Angeles to the San 
Fernando Valley discuss issues from overcrowding to the need for more bilingual 
teachers -- issues Quezada will take before the school board of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada, the third Latino (and first Latina) to serve on the school board, is 
fiercely committed to parent involvement in the schools and making leaders out 
of parents. Ninety percent of the students in the 5th District she represents 
are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to popular belief," Quezada said, "there are many active Latino 
parents in our schools. I encourage those parents to demand information and to 
expect that their children get a quality education. If we want parents to be a 
part of the education of their children they have to know by experience. 
</P>
<P>
"To have parents come in and make demands on a school or a teacher or a school 
board member should not be viewed as troublesome, but rather as an asset," said 
Quezada, 36. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the cornerstones that makes Leticia tick is the commitment to empower 
those who don't have it, especially the parents she represents," said Quezada's 
husband, Steven Uranga, 41, a city management analyst for the Community 
Development Department of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One of those parents is Martha Cardenas, the mother of a junior and a senior in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
"Being involved at the district level is new for me," said Cardenas, a member 
of the Hispanic Parent Coalition, a group of Latinos who regularly meet with 
Quezada. 
</P>
<P>
"She has encouraged us as parents to stay informed because she is willing to 
share information with us," Cardenas said. "I feel re-energized as a parent 
because we have somebody who cares about us. She listens to us." 
</P>
<P>
Armida Navarro, an East Los Angeles community leader and District 5 resident 
for more than 20 years, said parent participation has increased as a result of 
Quezada's efforts to increase recruitment of Latino teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that Leticia has learned a lot from working with parents. And she makes 
herself available. But, more than anything, she has shown her constituency that 
Latinos count," said Navarro, who has had three children graduate from the 
district and presently has a daughter in eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Alvarez, a member of the Hispanic Parent Coalition and chairman of a 
regional bilingual advisory committee, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"For more than 20 years we have been fighting for more parent training so we 
can have a say in the education of our children," he said, adding that Quezada 
has helped Latino parent groups plan strategy so that more parents can become 
involved. "She has motivated us," said Alvarez, the South Gate parent of a 
fourth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Parent participation at Wilson High School in northeast Los Angeles is up as a 
direct result of Quezada's influence, said Ramon Castillo, the first Latino 
principal in that school's 53-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"She has had night meetings here in which she addressed the problems and 
possible solutions to the gang situation. With each meeting more and more 
parents attended because she familiarized the community with the problem by 
including administrators, teachers, the police and, most important, the 
parents," Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two months ago, he said, Quezada spoke before a packed auditorium 
about the district's Shared Decision Making program, which trains parents how 
to have a say in matters of staff development, student discipline and school 
budgets. She spoke to the parents in both English and Spanish and encouraged 
them to carry out plans of action to ensure quality education for their 
children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow school board member Roberta Weintraub said Quezada, who holds a 
full-time job as manager of community relations and Latino marketing for the 
Carnation Co., is extremely businesslike. "She is very efficient and corporate 
because she works in corporate America. She is diligent and thorough." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Quezada's business approach to school board matters was in high 
gear as she helped make one of the board's most difficult and important 
decisions affecting the district -- putting schools on a year-round calendar. 
</P>
<P>
She said after months of researching the subject she had no choice but to vote 
for the year-round schedule and stick to her decision. "I felt that the 
decision the board made was very important and necessary because we have a 
housing crisis for students," Quezada said. "We expect 20,000 new children next 
year and we have no classrooms where they can go." 
</P>
<P>
She said the year-round calendar decision is not an issue of, "Are you for or 
against overcrowding?" but instead "an issue of resolving a problem even if it 
took an unpopular action by the board." 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing to do is to construct new schools and we are pursuing that," 
she said, "but not fast enough to meet the needs of the district." 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in 1987, Quezada has carried the banner for the district's 
Master Plan for the Education of the Limited English Proficient Students, who 
now number 187,000. Of that total, 165,000 are Spanish speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada has fought and won to get a $5,000 salary incentive for bilingual 
teachers and is working on a plan to have teaching assistants -- who number 
10,000 in the district -- reach full-fledged bilingual teacher status. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada is quick to recall her personal and school experiences. Her mother had 
to cross the Juarez border into El Paso every Sunday to work as a maid, cook 
and baby-sitter until the next Friday when she returned. During the week, 
Quezada attended school, kept house and cared for her sick father, a miner with 
a second-grade education. He always spoke to her about the importance of a good 
education. Afflicted with tuberculosis, he died at age 33. Leticia was just 9 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, her immigrant experience began -- one that included getting 
Fs at a new school in Pittsburg, Calif., because of the cultural barriers she 
faced as an adolescent immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to make sense of the foreign language that filled her ears, she 
drilled herself to the point of exhaustion every night, slept with a dictionary 
under her pillow and attended classes religiously. 
</P>
<P>
"I experienced a lot of trauma, alienation, anger and embarrassment," Quezada 
recalls. "Those were the most difficult times of my life because my father 
always instilled in me the desire to have a good education, and here I wasn't 
learning anything in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
That's why Quezada says she knows exactly how the Spanish-speaking students 
feel about sitting in a classroom, learning the English language from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
But she is confident the students she refers to as "the children" will survive. 
She has set a plan in action so that they might. And she believes in a 
philosophy she says works: the personal touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Whomever you are in the school district, you have to live every single moment 
of your workday believing that what those children need from you is caring," 
she said. "They are not masses of human beings. They are not problems. They are 
hungry for education and we must feed their souls with it."

'LATINS ANONYMOUS': COMEDY GROUP IS NO LONGER ANONYMOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, Churnin is a free-lance writer based in San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Latins Anonymous" began when four Latino actors, tired of Hollywood 
stereotyping them as anonymous drug lords and pregnant maids, decided to write 
a comedy for themselves that would lampoon Latino cliches. 
</P>
<P>
As they stayed up long nights dreaming up skits, Luisa Leschin, Diane 
Rodriguez, Armando Molina and Rick Najera hoped their show would last long 
enough to prove to agents and producers that they could do comedy as well as 
cliches. 
</P>
<P>
When the show opened at the Los Angeles Theatre Center Sept. 15, "Latins 
Anonymous" was booked for a six-week run. But with the show having been 
extended time and again for 6 1/2 months -- the longest-running program in the 
theater's history -- they find they are not so anonymous anymore. 
</P>
<P>
After "Latins Anonymous" closes at LATC on April 1, its next stop will be the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre in June. 
</P>
<P>
They said they have been discussing a movie version of "Latins Anonymous" with 
Moctesuma Esparza, co-producer of "The Milagro Beanfield War." They are also 
talking about a television project of the same script with producer Richard 
Soto. 
</P>
<P>
Najera was hired as a staff writer with the "Grand Slam" TV series and is 
working on a film script with Seabrook Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the group's initial hope was that "Latins Anonymous" would prove a 
showcase that would get them more acting jobs, casting agents have not been 
beating down their doors. Most of the nibbles have come from producers who want 
to see more of their work as writers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, we did this as four actors wanting to help ourselves," said 
Leschin, interviewed by telephone from Rodriguez's home, where she was working 
on a new script with Rodriguez and Molina. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a lesson in many ways in that you work two years refining a show, 
and you get it up and it's a big success, and people said it was great and 
wonderful and now give me more of your ideas," Leschin said. 
</P>
<P>
Their popularity, however, has helped other Latino groups, said Jose Delgado, 
administrator of the Latino Theatre Lab that recommended the group to LATC. 
</P>
<P>
"They have demonstrated that if you have Latino programming, the Latino 
community is going to come out," Delgado said. "They have definitely been one 
of our success stories." 
</P>
<P>
Television producer Soto is clearly impressed with "Latins Anonymous," whose 
skits include, among others, Latinos who Anglicize their names (as Leschin did 
in real life) and the stereotype of macho Latinos in a piece called "Machos of 
Omaha." 
</P>
<P>
"What appealed to me about the play is that I think that finally, finally, we 
can tell stories that are more complex about Hispanics in the city," Soto said. 
"These people reflect in real life what a lot of the people think they are 
doing on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's only the beginning," Soto said. "The emerging Hispanic middle 
class is the single most unreported phenomenon about Latinos today. I think 
there are Latinos all over this country that are waiting to hear their 
message." 
</P>
<P>
Performances in English until April 1 are at 8 p.m. Fridays through Sundays 
with Saturday/Sunday matinees at 2. Tickets are $15 to $18. At 514 S. Spring 
St., Los Angeles; (213) 627-5599.

BEISBOL GIVES DOMINICAN BOYS A CHANCE AT FAME AND RICHES

The robust dark clouds that have been lingering over the city finally unload 
their cargo with unabashed gusto, but nobody runs for cover at the Campo Las 
Palmas baseball academy. 
</P>
<P>
A tropical rain or two is not going to keep the boys here from practicing 
beisbol, the vehicle they hope to use to reach fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1987 by the Los Angeles Dodgers after five years at another location 
on the island, the camp is one of several operated year-round by major league 
baseball teams to develop young players in what has become the most fertile 
source of talent for the American pastime anywhere in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, for instance, more than 50 Dominicans played in the majors and 
many more toiled in the minors. They come from all over this small Caribbean 
country of about 6 million people, but the southern coast town of San Pedro de 
Macoris, which has produced, among others, St. Louis first baseman Pedro 
Guerrero, Toronto shortstop Tony Fernandez, Texas second baseman Julio Franco 
and new Dodger outfielder Juan Samuel, is the undisputed hotbed. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is a mine," commented academy director Rafael (Ralph) Avila, 60, a 
Cuban-born former amateur player who has been a Dodger scout since 1966. Avila, 
the Dodgers head scout in Latin America, said he first proposed the idea of an 
academy to former Dodger general manager Al Campanis in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-acre camp is modest but well-equipped. It houses 40 players, ages 16 to 
19, in a dormitory setting and includes a formal dining room -- named after 
Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda -- quarters for the instructors and a recreation 
room that doubles as a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
There are three baseball diamonds at the complex, three lighted batting cages 
and 12 pitching machines. 
</P>
<P>
The players fall into three categories: those under contract, those who are 17 
years of age or older and might be signed to Dodger contracts, and those who 
are 16 and cannot turn professional for another year, as dictated by Dominican 
law. Those under contract play as the Santo Domingo Dodgers in summer and in 
winter leagues for rookies, and some are reserves on top-flight professional 
clubs here such as Licey, Estrellas Orientales and Escogido. 
</P>
<P>
"What interests us the most in this camp is the development of ballplayers, not 
winning championships," Avila said. Yet his teams have won titles in three 
winter and two summer leagues of the six in which they have played. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't set a rule as far as how long we keep them at the camp," he said. 
"The time it takes them to graduate depends on what they have in their heads 
and in their guts." 
</P>
<P>
Avila's coaching and scouting staff includes former Dodger infielder Teddy 
Martinez and Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin's uncle, Argona Read. They have 
helped mold some of the most promising youngsters to come out of here in recent 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
At its previous location, the academy produced Dodger outfielder Jose Gonzalez, 
and catcher Gilberto Reyes, shortstop Mariano Duncan and pitcher Alejandro 
Pena, all since traded to other clubs. Notable Las Palmas graduates include 
Dodger right-hander Ramon Martinez, minor leaguers Jose Vizcaino (the potential 
heir to Griffin at shortstop), Jose Oferman and Braulio Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't sign players for the minor leagues," Avila said. "These players are 
here because the consensus of the staff is that they possess the tools, the 
ability to reach the major leagues if they develop as we expect them to." 
</P>
<P>
Avila said that at least 10 players will leave the camp for Class A assignments 
this season at Vero Beach, Fla., and Salem, Ore., and rookie league work at 
Great Falls, Mont., and Kissimmee, Fla. They include outfielder Freddy 
Gonzalez, who led all U.S. minor leagues in hitting last year with a .381 
average while at Kissimmee. Others are power-hitting outfielder Raul Montesi, 
second baseman Gustavo Zapata and right-handed pitcher Pedro Martinez, Ramon's 
18-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
"The general opinion here is that (Montesi) is the best prospect this year," 
Avila said of the 18-year-old from San Cristobal. "Everything he does is above 
average. . . . He's an outstanding fastball hitter with tremendous power. We 
call him 'Popeye.' " 
</P>
<P>
Avila has been equally impressed with Martinez: "Right now, Pedro is a much 
better pitcher than Ramon was at the same age. He has a good curve, good 
control and better velocity than Ramon. He now throws 88 m.p.h. He's a 
tremendous prospect." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez hopes Avila's assessment is correct: "My dream is to pitch next to my 
brother," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because these players and those to follow -- as experience has proved -- will 
have to make adjustments to life in a vastly different environment once in the 
United States, the academy supplements the baseball regimen with educational 
and social training that ranges from English classes to fundamentals of 
etiquette to money management. 
</P>
<P>
Said scout-instructor Pablo Peguero, a former minor league catcher in the 
Dodger chain: "The main benefit is that when they arrive in the United States 
they also know how to handle things other than baseball. . . . Some of these 
boys are from deep in the country and don't even know how to use a toilet." 
</P>
<P>
Some also have problems with English classes. But teacher Joaquin Colome and 
the players are enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going pretty well, considering that the boys don't have a high level of 
education," Colome said. "It's an English of daily situations so that the 
individual has a basic notion and can deal with any necessity over there (in 
the United States)." 
</P>
<P>
Avila also wants the young players to remember discipline when they start 
earning substantial salaries in the United States. He has seen players shift 
their focus from the game to impressing folks with their good fortune, a trap 
that has ruined many promising careers. 
</P>
<P>
"They get to the United States with nothing and all of a sudden find themselves 
with $700 or $800 in their pockets, and they think they own the world," Avila 
said. "And since they have never had money, they don't know how to spend it." 
</P>
<P>
"Then, after they have bought jewelry, radios, stereos, shoes and fancy 
clothes, they want to come home. Many people used to confuse that with being 
homesick, but in reality it wasn't that they wanted to see mom or dad or their 
brothers and sisters. What they wanted to do was show off what they had 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we find out about those who are more interested in hats, jewelry and 
drugs here, before we have too much invested in them. Before, those problems 
surfaced in the United States. Now we weed them out here." 
</P>

JACK SMITH: A CAN OF PEANUTS, A JUG OF COGNAC AND THE BIG ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Christmas our younger son and his wife gave us a large trunk-like box 
filled with the sort of articles one sees on lists of things to keep ready in 
case of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
We in Southern California live in constant expectation of the Big One and a 
great many of us, though by no means all, have begun to prepare our earthquake 
kits. 
</P>
<P>
Ours does not contain every recommended item, but it is a good start: 
flashlight, batteries, jugs of water, first-aid kit, work gloves, a can of 
peanuts and so on. 
</P>
<P>
One item, however, seemed especially thoughtful, perhaps because it is not one 
usually included on lists published by our newspaper and other responsible 
institutions. It was a squat bottle with a wine glass attached to its neck by a 
ribbon. Wrapped around it was a note in my French daughter-in-law's 
handwriting: "I know you don't drink cognac but when the Big One comes you will 
change your mind and be grateful to me! Jackie" 
</P>
<P>
It was a bottle of a French cognac called Salignac, a brand noted for the long 
marriage of its blends. 
</P>
<P>
It was not only a very French thing for our daughter-in-law to do, but the more 
I thought about it the more I realized it was a very humane thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
I have no doubt that when the Big One comes and I am trembling among the ruins 
of my house, I will appreciate a little snort of brandy. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Jay L. Ambrose of Santa Monica sends me a page from a Colorado 
newspaper of June 8, 1921, describing a flood that had devastated the town of 
Pueblo two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Homes and businesses were demolished by the raging overflow from the Arkansas 
River and Franklin Creek. The dead were estimated at 500 or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Men, women and children are in dire need," an official was quoted as saying. 
"When the Arkansas was at its height, Fountain Creek, bringing its wall of 
water 20 feet high, joined the Arkansas and increased the desolation. Houses, 
corpses, dead livestock, automobiles, boxcars, trees, all swirled around and 
floated down the Arkansas. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
What fascinated me, however, was a story reporting an extraordinarily humane 
gesture, considering that in June, 1921, the Prohibition Amendment was barely 
one year old and the nation was supposedly in an exaltation of abstemious zeal. 
</P>
<P>
The story appeared under the following headline: Whisky Taboo Off in Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
"June 8, 1921 -- Prohibition has been suspended at Pueblo for a 30-day period 
by the federal government in order that the stricken city may be supplied with 
liquor to combat sickness and disease, according to Frank J. Medina, federal 
state prohibition director. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty gallons of whisky and alcohol were shipped to Pueblo this morning and 
arrangements made to send more this afternoon. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"The liquor will be obtained by permits to be issued by board of health 
directors, sanitary commissioners and other authorities in charge. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
One can imagine the stampede of citizens reporting in ill and demanding 
whiskey. I know whiskey is regarded as a cure, or at least a comfort, in folk 
medicine, but I had not thought health authorities would prescribe it in large 
doses for disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
I also wonder where the whiskey came from, since the law of the land made the 
distillation of potable spirits illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently the officials had a large supply of seized contraband in stock, 
piously waiting for just such an emergency to dispense it in the public weal. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose writes that he was 17 at the time of the flood and was living in 
Pueblo. "We were left homeless and destitute. However, my father, a lifelong 
connoisseur of whiskey, grieved over the fact that he lost four cases of Old 
Taylor Kentucky Bourbon. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I wonder whether our own health authorities are prepared to make as magnanimous 
a gesture as those of Colorado when the Big One does come. 
</P>
<P>
I don't recall reading that anyone passed out free booze in the recent Bay Area 
quake. Of course, San Francisco has more bars per capita than any other city in 
the world, and I imagine they did a pretty lively business that night. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to my daughter-in-law's thoughtful gift, I don't have to worry. I'm 
prepared. Except for the peanuts, though, she didn't put in any food.

Latest Fall: Former hotel queen Leona Helmsley said her 81-year-old husband 
Harry Helmsley is "all right" after falling down a flight of stairs Monday and 
hitting his head in his New York apartment, columnist Cindy Adams wrote in 
Tuesday's New York Post. "I was waiting for Harry to join me for lunch," 
Helmsley was quoted as saying. "Instead, an ambulance became my lunch." 
Convicted of tax evasion and other charges, Leona Helmsley is free pending an 
appeal. Harry Helmsley was ruled incompetent to stand trial on income tax 
evasion charges.

South for the Winter: Globe-trotting novelist James A. Michener is hunting for 
a winter retirement home in Florida, his editor says. Michener recently visited 
a group of retired professionals in St. Petersburg, editor James Kings said 
Monday. "He said they were very interesting people down there, and he was more 
interested in that than he was in the sun," Kings said. 
</P>

Bleacher Bum: Pete Rose is facing his first season out of baseball since 1963 
with a sense of humor. "I'm ready for it. The only difference is I think I'll 
have to pay to go to the games now. So I'll pay for my tickets, sit behind home 
plate and the first guy that strikes out I'm going to boo," the former 
Cincinnati Reds manager said Tuesday in Indianapolis. But, he said, some things 
are not funny: "To see guys turn on me because of hearsay. . . . Guys that I 
thought were my so-called friends." Baseball's career-hit leader was banned 
from the sport Aug. 24 for illegal gambling.

Pump It Up: The White House limousine pulled up to Dave's Sunoco service 
station in Washington, D.C., Tuesday and out popped George Bush in a photo 
opportunity for his clean-air program. Bush helped inaugurate the new methanol 
fuel pump at Dave's. Methanol fuel is cleaner-burning than regular gasolines, 
but environmentalists charge that Bush's legislative compromises weakened the 
clean-air package. While Bush spoke, demonstrators nearby carried placards 
reading "Clean Air Hypocrisy."

YOUR STAMPS: SOME SETS ARE NOT AVAILABLE ANY MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Question: I recently received a 25-cent green Paul Revere stamp on a letter, 
but after asking at my local post office I discovered that this stamp is no 
longer for sale. Aren't 25-cent stamps the current postage rate? -- T.H. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, but they have to be stocked by the U.S. Postal Service in order 
for you to buy them. A number of 25-cent stamps have been issued by the United 
States in past years when the first-class letter rate was much less than the 
present 25 cents per ounce (for the first ounce). Such is the case with the 
Paul Revere issue (pictured), first sold April 18, 1958, and produced in a coil 
(roll) format starting Feb. 25, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
This stamp has been removed from all post offices and is available only from 
dealers or collectors. The coil version is not worth much over face value, but 
the pane (sheet) variety (Scott 1048) carries a small premium for singles or 
mint plate number blocks. (The first-class letter rate went from 22 cents to 25 
cents April 3, 1988.) 
</P>
<P>
Q: My 1935 Canadian stamp set (the dates are printed on the designs) has six 
different values, showing pictures of King George V, Queen Mary, the Duke of 
York, Windsor Castle, among others. What is this set worth? -- T.I. 
</P>
<P>
A: About $20 mint, $10 cancelled for choice copies, retail price. Issued May 4, 
1935, this set commemorates the 25th anniversary of the accession to the 
British throne of King George V, who, by the way, was a serious stamp 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
Q: At a yard sale last summer, I bought a 19th-Century sepia-toned formal 
portrait photograph of a man and a woman. On the back of this photo is an 
orange, uncancelled 2-cent U.S. Revenue stamp, bearing George Washington's 
picture. I am curious what the stamp might be worth uncancelled and why it is 
on the back of the photograph at all. Did the federal government tax 
photographs? -- W.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The Civil War was starting to prove stubborn and costly, so the U.S. 
Government decided to raise money by taxing common documents, including wills, 
telegrams, playing cards, bank checks and photographs. Because so many 
photographs were taken during the Civil War years and shortly after, such 
revenue-stamped photos are not rare; they are worth about $1 or $2 each on the 
average, retail price. 
</P>
<P>
Your photograph is more important than the stamp, and if you can find an old 
photo of a famous person or of soldiers with weapons or Indian scouts in 
uniform, then you may have a prime premium item. Your stamp is probably the 
U.S. Internal Revenue 2-cent orange of 1864, listed in the Scott catalogue at 5 
cents and having no special premium if uncancelled. It is unlikely that you 
have a scarce printing variety of this stamp, such as a "double transfer" worth 
$20 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My 10-cent brown Daniel Webster stamp has a black overprint "GUAM" across 
its face. It is mint and undamaged. Can you evaluate? -- L.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: If genuine (a few counterfeits exist), you probably own a copy of the 1899 
10-cent brown Type I Guam overprint possession issue, currently worth about $50 
mint, a little more for a legitimate cancel, for nice well-centered stamps 
(retail price). Captured during the Spanish-American War during the summer of 
1898, Guam was ceded to the United States by treaty at war's end. Regular U.S. 
stamps were overprinted "GUAM" and were used on the island from July, 1899 
through March, 1901, after which regular unoverprinted U.S. stamps were sold 
and used there. The 1899-1901 overprint series was used for several years, 
however, until postal supplies were exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, but unlikely, that you have the rare Type II of this stamp, 
currently selling for several thousand dollars per copy. Take it to a stamp 
dealer for an informal appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you recommend for a present to a potential stamp collector? A boy 
and girl, both age 7, have birthdays coming up, and I want to get them 
interested in stamps. -- R.J. 
</P>
<P>
A: I started collecting stamps at 7 also, when an uncle gave me my first stamp 
album and my father showed me how to hinge stamps into it. Seven is a great age 
to start one of the greatest hobbies in the world. I recommend an inexpensive 
stamp album, a package of U.S. or foreign stamps, some hinges and a birthday 
card. Any stamp dealer can supply the stamp materials in a price range to suit 
any budget.

YOUR COINS: NOT ALL UNCIRCULATED PROOF SETS RISE IN VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Will you kindly let me know the value of uncirculated proof sets of 
1978, '79, '80 and '81. Also the value of the 1975 Bicentennial medal 
commemorating the battles of Lexington and Concord; plus the Paul Revere gold 
American Revolution Bicentennial coin, 1776-1976; and the U.S. Bicentennial 
silver proof set. -- T.G.W. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Proof sets and uncirculated sets are popular ways of collecting U.S 
coinage. I suspect your reference to "uncirculated" proof sets actually means 
proof sets that have not been circulated. Since the middle 1950s, these sets 
have been produced in large quantities, which attests to their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, they are, by and large, not investment-quality coins, at least not 
at this point. Still, many people want complete dates of these sets, so they 
continue to buy the new issues and occasionally fill in the earlier dates, 
which go back to 1936 and can be quite expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Your 1978 and 1979 proof sets were issued at $9 each. The '78 is currently 
worth about $6.75 and the '79 is about $5.25. The 1980 proof set originally 
cost $10; it's now worth about $5.25. The '81 originally cost $11 and it's now 
worth about $8.75. 
</P>
<P>
These are sets to own and enjoy. You can appreciate their beauty and, quite 
possibly, eventually realize a profit if you can bear to part with them. If 
you're interested in investment-quality coins, you'll have to seek earlier 
dates and lower mintages, as a rule. 
</P>
<P>
Your Bicentennial medal is worth about $8; the Paul Revere gold and the 
Bicentennial silver proof set are primarily worth their bullion content. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please let me know if this is worth anything (enclosed is a copy of a 5-cent 
Military Payment Certificate). -- G.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: The market for such wartime currency is virtually nil. Your MPC, as it is 
known, has little or no collector value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: As an older citizen of Encino, I would like information on finding a 
reputable coin firm in the San Fernando Valley where I live. I would like to 
sell my small coin collection, mostly U.S. silver and gold coins, dated in the 
19th Century. The Yellow Pages list many dealers; the problem is to find one 
well-recommended. -- E.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: As a matter of policy, I do not recommend dealers. The reason is, dealers 
work on different profit margins, dealers have different needs and different 
customers to satisfy, and dealers disagree among themselves as to what a coin 
is worth. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to list your coins, contact dealers and see what they will 
offer. Most dealers will want to see your coins before giving you a quote. It 
will take a little work, but eventually you'll be able to determine the best 
price in today's market. If in doubt, don't sell. Have prices quoted for the 
entire lot and also for individual coins. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am seeking information on a commemorative medal that is shaped like a 
coin. The item is platinum, weighs about .75 ounces, is round and came in a 
leather-covered gift box. The medal commemorates Expo '70 Japan World 
Exposition, Osaka, Japan, 1970. I would be interested in knowing its value and 
whether there is a market for this medal. Is there a magazine or source for 
people who collect this type of item? And how might I reach them? -- S.M.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: Essentially, what you have is a bullion piece that is worth about 90% of the 
spot price of platinum. However, if you can locate a token collector, 
specifically one who is interested in world's fairs and expos, you might do 
better. Seek them out at coin shows or contact the California Assn. of Token 
Collectors, which meets the third Monday of the month at 8 p.m. at Mercury 
Savings &amp; Loan, 2920 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West Los Angeles. Mailing address: 
Box 943, Santa Monica, Calif. 90406.

For a friend, Tye Roy of Orange would love to find a two-cup teakettle that 
whistles. Can you help with an idea that will fit the friend to a T, or will 
they both be blowing hot air until they're in their cups over this?

William Carnahan of San Pedro, who is restoring a landmark house, is 
practically on his hands and knees in search of an old-fashioned linoleum rug 
for the kitchen; the one he is looking for should be appropriate for the '20s 
or '30s. Armstrong discontinued making these rugs a few years ago, but Carnahan 
hopes someone still has one in stock; size is not a problem. If you could help, 
you'd never hear another squeak out of Carnahan; as a matter of fact, he'd 
positively be floored.

Pat Bias of Tujunga is trying to replace her husband's favorite weeding tool -- 
a round bulb with a straight handle and a two-pointed prong; except for the 
tip, it was made of wood. Unless you can dig up a source, don't expect Bias' 
husband to turn over any new leaves this spring.

Reader-to-Reader-Help Line: Doris at (213 697-8480 is trying to locate an 
obsolete Rival Shred-O-Mat for her daughter; please see to it that neither 
Doris nor the daughter goes to pieces over this. . . . Dorothy at (818) 
789-5803 would like to find a hair roller made decades ago by the Goody Co. 
It's a 5" stainless-steel cylinder, slotted in the center, with a red rubber 
tip at one end. Let's hope you know where to get one right off the top of your 
head, otherwise Dorothy may start tearing her hair out. . . . Dolores at (213)

Neva Clog staples to go with it; she would even settle for someone who can 
repair the staplers, since they are very light and she has arthritis. Nobody is 
trying to make light of this, but Doris could sure use a helping hand here.

John Aldrich of Santa Barbara and Dennis Madison of South Laguna, both of whom 
were looking for an electric gadget that tells owners of rural mail boxes when 
the mail has arrived, will soon be able to stay posted. Joseph S. Kovacs saw 
such an item at The Best of Everything, in the Westwood Pavilion, Los Angeles. 
Ruth Frantz of Santa Barbara, Margot Jensen of Whittier, William Watson Jr. of 
Vista, Verna Newland of Downey and John Saxby of San Clemente all told us about 
an item made by Signa Mail Systems, 204 E. 2nd Ave., San Mateo, Calif. 94401, 
(415) 340-0126; however, according to Saxby, this works only on mail boxes with 
doors that are hinged at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
More sources: Julie C. Hopkins of Studio City told us about a gadget from the 
Gardener's Supply Spring Catalogue, 128 Intervale Road, Burlington, Vt. 05401, 
that flips up a metal flag when the carrier opens the box. Muriel Menasco of 
Orange says a similar item is Mail Time, made by Alsto Co., P.O,. Box 1267, 
Galesburg, Ill. 61401; it costs about $8.50. Of course, these have value only 
if the mail box is visible from the house. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Davey of Northridge and Monique Marti mention a Motion Alert, which sets 
off a musical alarm inside the house and is available from Sporty's, Clermont 
Airport, Batavia, Ohio 45103-9747. According to Ken Haagensen of North 
Hollywood, the same item was listed in a recent -- but not the latest -- 
catalogue put out by DAK Industries, 8200 Remmet Ave., Canoga Park, Calif. 
91304-9955. And Ivan Maruno of Whittier sent us a page from Computers &amp; 
Electronics magazine that describes how you can put together and install your 
own Mailbox Sentry; this is for do-it-yourselfers who enjoy tinkering with 
electronics. (If interested, send us a stamped, self-addressed envelope.)

For Sally Dewald of Colton, who wanted a frosted-denim slit skirt, we have only 
one reply. Barbara Myers of Claremont said a catalogue put out by Blair, 
located in Warren, Pa. 16366, features some of these skirts. We have forwarded 
that information to Dewald.

LEGAL VIEW: JUDGES HAVE SOME LEEWAY IN CONTRACT DISPUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What happens if two sections of a contract conflict with one another? Which one 
will be enforced by a judge? 
</P>
<P>
It's not a purely hypothetical question. Actually, it is fairly common, 
especially when a printed form contract is used as the basis for an agreement. 
For example, many landlords use a form rental agreement but then add clauses or 
paragraphs that apply to their particular apartment building, or cross out 
provisions they don't like. 
</P>
<P>
And since form agreements are often full of fine print, it is not unusual to 
find an added provision that conflicts with something in the printed portion. 
</P>
<P>
State law has a specific answer. The Civil Code provides that "where a contract 
is partly written and partly printed . . . the written parts control the 
printed parts. . . . And if the two are absolutely repugnant, the latter must 
be so far disregarded." 
</P>
<P>
Let's see how it works with a simple example. Assume that a form rental 
contract has a line, hidden in the fine print, that prohibits the tenant from 
having a pet. But the landlord and the tenant agree that the tenant's friendly 
kitten can stay in the rented house, so they write in a sentence that says it's 
OK for the tenant to keep the kitten, as long as she is kept inside. (The 
parties should each initial the new wording, as they should do with any other 
handwritten changes in the agreement.) 
</P>
<P>
Technically, that new sentence directly contradicts another portion of the 
agreement, but since the new provision was handwritten, it will prevail. That 
would be true, even if the addition was typed. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that contracts be "read as a whole" and that any repugnancy 
be "reconciled, if possible, by such an interpretation as will give some effect 
to the repugnant clauses, subordinate to the general intent and purpose of the 
whole contract." 
</P>
<P>
Those are the actual words of the statute, and like most statutes, they may be 
a bit confusing. Essentially, what all this means is that judges have some 
leeway in interpreting contracts; they are encouraged to enforce them, maintain 
them and make the "whole" contract internally consistent in some way. 
</P>
<P>
In our landlord-tenant example, for instance, if the tenant decided to replace 
the friendly kitten with a German shepherd, a judge would have to decide 
whether the provision permitting the kitten was merely one exception to the 
otherwise firm rule of no pets, or whether the exception was meant to make the 
original "no pet" provision invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this sort of dispute would probably never wind up in court because 
of the costs involved, but it does demonstrate the point: Contract terms and 
conditions are never written to cover every contingency. Judges have to 
interpret them in accordance with the intent of the parties and the language of 
the rest of the contract, always bearing in mind -- today's lesson -- that the 
written word prevails over the printed word.

THE VEGETARIAN: RED PEPPERS, CHEESE: PRETTY APPETIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA SHAW, Shaw is a free-lance writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There seems to be a run on sweet red peppers at present, with huge, glossy 
specimens going for half the usual price. Aside from adding a subtle sweetness 
to tossed salads or vegetable sautes, red peppers are a good source of Vitamin 
C. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a recipe that combines the sweet peppers with a tangy cheese for an 
unconventional appetizer or side dish. 
</P>
<P>
RED PEPPER TERRINES 
</P>
<P>
4 medium sweet red peppers, halved, cored and seeded 
</P>
<P>
4 eggs, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cottage cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup feta cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
Butter 
</P>
<P>
6 small bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
Place peppers on broiling pan and broil until charred, about 10 minutes, 
turning as needed. Transfer to plastic bag and place in freezer 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Peel peppers, slice and puree in blender or food processor. Add eggs, bread 
crumbs, cottage cheese and feta cheese. Blend until well combined. Add oregano 
and salt. Blend again. 
</P>
<P>
Lightly butter 6 (6-ounce) ramekins or custard cups. Place 1 bay leaf in bottom 
of each ramekin. Divide pepper mixture evenly among cups. Place in deep 
roasting or baking pan. Pour hot water to halfway up ramekins. Bake at 375 
degrees 50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. 
</P>
<P>
Let cool on rack 15 minutes. Run knife around edge of each terrine and invert 
onto serving dish. Makes 6 first course servings.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: WINTER AND ALCOHOL DON'T ALWAYS MIX WELL TOGETHER, SO BE 
CAREFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've been on the slopes for hours, and it's time to head back to the lodge. 
Once you get in and get your gear off, you decide to have a good stiff drink to 
warm up before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with this picture? Alcohol does make us feel warm, and who can 
forget the image of the faithful Saint Bernard reviving stranded skiers with a 
cask of Cognac? 
</P>
<P>
But, in truth, that dog might do better carrying hot cocoa rather than Cognac. 
Winter and alcohol aren't always a healthy mix, and the warming effects of 
alcohol are purely illusory. The flush in the cheeks that it produces results 
from dilation of blood vessels in the skin. The net effect is not body warming 
but a loss of body heat. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, at appropriate times and in reasonable quantities, alcohol can be 
pleasant and safe. But it's important to understand how it acts in the body. 
Unlike foods, which must be digested before being absorbed, alcohol enters the 
bloodstream intact. Since it's absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, 
the presence of food can provide a barrier, slowing absorption and moderating 
physiological effects. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the blood, alcohol circulates through the body. Some enters the brain, 
where it acts as a central nervous system depressant. The first brain functions 
to be affected are reason and judgment, deluding us into feeling invincible. 
Thus, a drinker on the slopes -- as well as on a highway -- is a menace both to 
himself and to others. If alcohol intake continues, motor skills deteriorate. 
When levels climb high enough, alcohol has an anesthetic effect, which may be 
followed by respiratory failure and death. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking needn't produce such dire consequences as long as consumption doesn't 
exceed the liver's ability to metabolize, or detoxify, the alcohol. A healthy 
adult can metabolize only a single ounce of pure alcohol each hour. This 
approximates the amount in a shot of hard liquor, a glass of wine, or a bottle 
of beer. Nothing -- not coffee, vitamins or exercise -- can speed this 
metabolic process. 
</P>
<P>
Gulping alcoholic drinks, rather than sipping them, produces a stupor. But 
intoxication, even if only occasional, can affect more than just behavior. The 
liver, pancreas and intestines become acutely inflamed. Nutrients, such as 
amino acids and certain vitamins and minerals, may not be absorbed normally. 
Others are not converted to forms the body needs. 
</P>
<P>
Fat accumulates in the liver and, over time, can contribute to cirrhosis, or 
scarring, a life-threatening disorder. Levels of fat in the blood may also 
rise, while blood glucose levels often fall. Add to this the fact that heavy 
drinking frequently replaces nourishing foods, and it can spell nutritional 
havoc. 
</P>
<P>
The kidneys are also affected by alcohol, losing their ability to control water 
balance. This can lead to dehydration and retention of excess uric acid that, 
in turn, can precipitate gout in sensitive individuals. 
</P>
<P>
When athletes drink, the effects can be disastrous. Alcohol not only impairs 
motor skills, raising chances of injury, but the low blood sugar and 
dehydration that drinking produces can severely limit endurance. Performance 
may be affected still further by the shift in metabolism needed to process the 
alcohol. Buildup of lactic acid may occur. Although a normal by-product of 
intense exercise, high lactic-acid levels can contribute to muscle pain and 
soreness. Clearly, an athlete who has been drinking cannot perform at his best, 
although his judgment may be too impaired to realize it. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women -- and women who are attempting to get pregnant -- should also 
avoid alcohol. The risk of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, including physical birth 
defects, mental retardation and behavior problems, is greatest in children born 
to mothers who drink heavily. But even moderate consumption could be risky, 
especially early in pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is an athlete or pregnant or a heavy drinker. Even so, alcohol 
does translate into empty calories. With seven calories per gram, it has almost 
as many as fat (which has nine per gram) and nearly twice as many as 
carbohydrates and proteins, which both have four. And alcohol calories contain 
little else. Usually, any vitamin and minerals in the drink come from what's 
been added to the alcohol, such as orange juice. Most mixers are also high in 
empty calories, containing substantial amounts of sugar and very little real 
fruit juice. 
</P>
<P>
While it may seem that a daily beer, martini or glass of wine poses little 
threat to the waistline, keep in mind that just the extra 85 to 140 calories 
per day can mean nine to 15 pounds in a year. And in small doses, alcohol may 
stimulate the appetite. That's fine if you want to gain a few pounds. But if 
you're trying to avoid adding extra weight, it can sabotage efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frozen or Canned Vegetables: OK to Buy the Least Expensive 
</P>
<P>
Question: My friend and I are having a friendly argument about whether canned 
or frozen vegetables are superior. We're both along in years and living on 
limited incomes. I take the position of buying what's least expensive: canned 
vegetables. She sticks with frozen whenever possible, because they're richer in 
vitamins and minerals. Who's correct? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You are. Price, taste and sometimes special dietary considerations go 
into the decision about whether to buy canned or frozen vegetables. Also, the 
practical matter of whether there's room in the freezer can figure in. 
</P>
<P>
Nutrients are lost as produce is processed either by freezing or canning. Any 
differences in vitamin and mineral content between the two are too small to be 
significant. You should keep in mind, though, that once you get the product 
home, you can affect its nutrient content by using proper handling techniques 
in the kitchen. Chief among these are using only a minimum of water and cooking 
frozen vegetables just until done. 
</P>
<P>
Q: During my first pregnancy I had terrible morning sickness. In anticipation 
of having another baby, I'd like to know whether there's any new dietary advice 
about measures to control the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A: Not really. For some people, several time-honored suggestions do seem to 
help minimize, if not eliminate, the symptoms of morning sickness. One is to 
eat a few dry crackers before getting out of bed. Second, some women seem to 
tolerate several small meals better than three large ones. Taking liquids a 
half-hour before or after -- but not with -- meals also may help. Avoiding 
fried foods and cutting back on fat in general, avoiding spicy foods and such 
strongly flavored vegetables as cabbage, broccoli, turnips and onions all are 
recommended as measures that can offer relief. But the best antidote is a 
little time. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, for those women who are vulnerable to it, the nausea and vomiting 
often begin to subside after about the 12th week of pregnancy. The main point, 
of course, is that while the discomfort during early pregnancy can curtail your 
normal intake, it's important to resume as soon as possible a diet to meet not 
only your own nutrient needs but those of the developing baby. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our family agrees on very few vegetables besides broccoli, which we all 
love. I know it's rich in beta carotene and contains other compounds linked to 
decreased risk of cancer. These are great features, but does it provide other 
nutrients as well? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your family picked a winner, because broccoli is a nutritionally potent 
vegetable -- and a tasty one too. Government studies show that consumption is 
rising across the nation as more and more Americans come to appreciate broccoli 
for its flavor, as well as its contributions to nutrient needs. 
</P>
<P>
As you point out, it does contain considerable beta carotene, whose bright 
orange color is masked by the chlorophyll. In fact, a medium stalk provides 
nearly enough to meet the day's requirement for Vitamin A. While we don't tend 
to think of vegetables as sources of protein, the same stalk has nearly six 
grams, almost as much as an ounce of meat, making it one of the strongest 
vegetable sources. True, the quality is not equivalent to that in meat, but if 
eaten as part of a mixed meal, other foods can provide the amino acids it 
lacks, allowing the body to use it efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli has still other assets. It's an exceptionally good source of Vitamin 
C; it provides a number of B vitamins, and it's one of the best non-dairy 
sources of calcium. All that, and a single stalk has just 50 calories. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli does not take kindly to overcooking, which may explain its lack of 
popularity in some households. To avoid overcooking and at the same time 
conserve nutrients and flavor, stand it upright in about an inch of boiling 
water, cover the pot and let it cook for about 10 minutes, until barely done.

COOK IT LIGHT: RELLENOS WITH LESS CHOLESTEROL, FAT

DEAR JEANNE: Here is a relleno recipe that I grew up with. Could you please 
help me eliminate some fat and cholesterol? 
</P>
<P>
 -- DIANE, Poway, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
CHILES RELLENOS 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
1 (7-ounce) can whole green chiles, rinsed 
</P>
<P>
1 pound shredded Jack cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/3 pound shredded Cheddar cheese 
</P>
<P>
3 eggs, beaten 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 cup buttermilk baking mix 
</P>
<P>
2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in 13x9-inch pan. Place green chiles on top of melted butter, then 
top with combined cheeses. Mix together beaten eggs, salt, baking mix and milk. 
Pour over cheeses and bake at 350 degrees 40 to 45 minutes, until lightly 
browned. Makes 9 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DIANE: My revised recipe tastes every bit as good and is much better for 
you. By using reduced-fat cheeses and reducing the amount used, I was able to 
cut way down on the calories from fat and the cholesterol. Eliminating the egg 
yolks and just using whites in this casserole further reduced the cholesterol 
and fat. 
</P>
<P>
I also found that two tablespoons margarine was enough added fat with the 
tablespoon of oil I added with the egg whites (to compensate for the missing 
yolks). That's the reason for the nonfat dry milk powder as well. I simply made 
my own liquid egg substitute. Try my lightened version of this long-time 
favorite and see if you aren't just as pleased as I am with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEANNE 
</P>
<P>
LIGHTENED CHILES RELLENOS 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine

<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 cup buttermilk baking mix 
</P>
<P>
2 cups nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
Melt margarine in 13x9-inch baking dish, tilting to cover bottom of pan. Cut 
chiles into 1-inch-wide strips and place evenly over margarine.

NOISETTES REAPPEAR IN THE CUISINE CLASSIQUE OF TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
DINING: CHEF JEAN CLAUDE GUILLON BRINGS BACK THOSE THINLY SLICED PIECES OF 
LAMB, BEEF AND VEAL OVERLAPPING IN A CIRCLE ON A PLATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

There is something zealous in the drive by Japanese restaurant and hotel owners 
to parade their star chefs around the world, I suppose to show off their stuff, 
like some pushy mom coaxing Junior to play a virtuosic "Flight of the Bumble 
Bee." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened the other night when executive chef Jean Claude Guillon of 
the Japanese-owned Le Grand Hotel Du Cap-Ferrat in Le Cote D'Azur, stopped off 
at the sister Hotel Bel-Air on the way back from similar visits to affiliated 
hotels in Japan, Hong Kong and who knows where else the new Japanese owners 
have hotels in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing like a South of France meal in the middle of winter. It brings 
you back to the sun, so that the only thing dancing before your very eyes is 
not Michael Jackson walking into the Hotel Bel-Air dining room, or the woman at 
table number one bundled up in her Fendi fox, but the look of summer green in 
the salad, the blue of azure sea in the langouste and coquilles. 
</P>
<P>
The noisettes de filet d'agneau roti is another thing that fills the room with 
the fragrance of the Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
I remember going from restaurant to restaurant, from village to village, 
starting at Monaco and moving on to Cannes, where noisettes of lamb, veal and 
beef, thinly sliced and overlapping in a circle, were a common theme. 
</P>
<P>
It was the noisettes period in the cuisine nouvelle in those days. Overlapping 
noisettes of veal, beef and lamb were everywhere. I found them in Los Angeles, 
as well, when I returned, and lo, they seemed to disappear as quickly as they 
arrived, with the declaration by Paul Bocuse, the father of nouvelle cuisine 
himself, that nouvelle cuisine was dead. "Vive la Cuisine Classique," cried 
Bocuse, raising his fork and stabbing the hunk of beef on his plate. 
</P>
<P>
Cuisine Classique became -- and is still -- the cuisine of the moment. It's the 
cuisine that allows a diner to order a shameless hunk of meat on a bone, and 
sop up the juices with a hunk of bread without remorse. I've been sopping up 
juices unremorsefully from shameless hunks of meats (osso buco is my favorite 
even though it's Italian) ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The overlapping noisettes, which I had almost forgotten existed, appeared again 
at Guillon's dinner. Little overlapping noisettes circling the plate like a 
baggage claim belt or, to put it more delicately, like a carousel, brought back 
memories of those dinners on the Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
What you do with the noisettes is to cut away at the clean, clear slices of 
perfectly formed meat in dainty strokes so that a mere morsel spears onto the 
edge of the fork. Then you tap it gently into a pool of buttery sauce on the 
plate. It's OK, however, to sop up the delicious sauce with a tiny morsel of 
crusty bread stuck on a fork, although I did once observe Bocuse tear off a 
rather large piece of bread, coarsely dunk it in a sauce surrounding delicately 
arranged noisettes and stuff it whole into his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Guillon is no slouch in the restaurant business. His credentials read as 
Bocuse's resume might, only better: Les Trois Marches, L'Archestrate, Charles 
Barrier, Gaston Lenotre, Le Gavroche, Auberge de L'Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The menu he created started with a group of appetizers, which were passed with 
glasses of Louis Roederer, Brut 1983: pisaladiere, the pizza of the Riviera; 
tartlette ratatouille (crusty toast topped with ratatouille, a standby 
appetizer of Provence, plus tiny patty shells filled with langouste to remind 
you of the menu to come. 
</P>
<P>
Once at the table the menu began with a salad of baby greens (arugula, mache, 
frise) mixed with lobster and scallops. Then there was the fillets of roast St. 
Pierre (turbot) on a pool of wild mushroom-anchovy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The noisettes of roast lamb "comme on les aime en Provence" (as one likes them 
in Provence) was the same one that my memory brought alive. The sauce, as 
velvety brown as a coffee berry, responded to my crusty bread like a dream. 
Boscuse would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
It was the dessert that really unraveled the memory veil that separated me from 
those glorious days in the South of France. Suddenly I was at Hotel Du 
Cap-Ferrat, as it was called then, on the patio, under a white umbrella, 
beneath a spreading chestnut tree, the skirts of the crisp, white tablecloths 
fluttering in the sea breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Croustillant de Framboises et Le Coulis may sound formidable, but it is nothing 
more than a three-decker lace cookie sandwich filled with the creme patissiere 
that's used for Napoleons. In fact, the dessert is a rendition of the classic 
Napoleon, only using cookies instead of puff paste. 
</P>
<P>
A pool of raspberry sauce was the perfect flavor mate for the orange-flavored 
cookies, which the French call tuiles aux amandes, because they resemble roof 
tiles. These cookies often appear as after-dinner sweet nibbles in the form of 
broomstick rolls, curved tiles, cornets or other shapes, thanks to their 
pliability while still warm. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the noisettes, which require a complicated sauce and ingredients that 
only a restaurant chef would bother to deal with (such as a brown sauce made 
with lamb bones and stock), the cookie dessert is a great idea for home bakers 
who enjoy entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
What an impressive company dessert it is. The lace cookies are rather scary to 
attempt at first try, but once you have the hang of handling the baked cookie 
and know what to expect, they are as easy as any cookie to make. Once out of 
the oven lace cookies are either molded or allowed to cool flat on the pan. 
Cooling causes them to become brittle and no molding is possible unless 
rewarmed. These cookies are flat so no special handling is required. A little 
practice will help, however, before tackling the real thing for the big day. 
</P>
<P>
The creme patissiere can be made from scratch. But some chefs (not Guillon, you 
can wager) cheat a bit by using packaged pudding mix with some whipped cream 
folded in. It looks and tastes like the homemade creme patissiere, but it 
isn't. Restaurant pastry chefs make mountains of the creme patissiere to use as 
needed so no recipe was given. We'll share our tricky recipe using packaged 
mix. No one will ever know. 
</P>
<P>
The coulis used by the pastry chef for this recipe is made with raspberry juice 
and clear caramel, another restaurant procedure hard to duplicate at home. So 
we substituted raspberry puree and corn syrup with good results.

SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO DEVELOP A MORE HEALTHFUL DIET; 
</P>
<P>
NUTRITION: MOST OF US HAVE IMPROVED OUR DIETARY KNOWLEDGE, BUT WE CONTINUE TO 
MAKE UNREALISTIC, HARMFUL CHOICES. STARTING WITH THE BASIC FOOD GROUPS IS STILL 
THE BEST WAY TO DESIGN A DIET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The federal government has expanded its recommendation for a prudent diet to 
all Americans -- not just those at risk for heart disease -- which means that 
more and more people must learn to make sensible changes in their diets in 
order to ensure better health. 
</P>
<P>
But most adult Americans admit that they are already confused on this issue. At 
least 95% of those interviewed for a recent Gallup Poll said that while they 
believe balance, variety and moderation are keys to healthy eating, up to 45% 
say they are eliminating red meat from their diets and 36% are cutting out 
dairy foods to achieve this goal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite calls from health experts and agencies that fat in the diet be limited 
to 30% of all calories consumed for the day, with saturated fat intake 
restricted to just 10% -- Americans are still consuming far too much fat for 
their own good. Fat consumption in this country still lingers around 36%, 
experts report. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans have improved their knowledge of nutrition, said Nancy S. 
Wellman, president of the American Dietetic Assn., but they still make 
unrealistic and harmful food choices. She noted that 52% reported increasing 
their consumption of oat bran, and 48% said they were taking more vitamin 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of the Americans queried in the national survey, 
commissioned by the ADA and the International Food Information Council, said 
that they select foods based on their perceptions of items as "good" or "bad" 
because of fat and other feared elements -- despite advice to the contrary from 
health and nutrition experts. 
</P>
<P>
What this demonstrates, said Wellman, is that "Americans are surprisingly 
knowledgeable about nutrition and health, but when it comes to translating 
facts into food choices, most still opt for quick fixes and the latest health 
fads." 
</P>
<P>
But it is possible to adhere to the 30% fat recommendation. Whether following 
the scientific approach -- calculating fat grams and calories, or by taking 
some simple steps toward behavior modification. 
</P>
<P>
"If you follow simple guidelines," said Jackie Saracino, president of the 
California Dietetic Assn., "you'll be getting good nutrition and it will assist 
in lowering the amount of fat you consume." Following the basic four food 
groups is the best place to start, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Choose meats that are lean such as poultry without skin, fish and lean cuts of 
beef, pork and veal. And, in the milk group, purchase low-fat or nonfat milk 
products, such as milk, cottage cheese or yogurt. Replace ice cream with sorbet 
or sherbet, which is lower in fat. Select cheese that is made with nonfat or 
part-skim milk. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to read lables," Saracino said, "Don't just buy (a product) because 
of the health claim but read and analyze (the product to) see what it's made 
with. The label should say whether it's made with low-fat or skim milk." 
</P>
<P>
Saracino recommends that consumers try to choose whole grain products such as 
wheat, oats, corn. And be sure to include fresh vegetables and fruits each day. 
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions include avoid adding fat to prepared foods or when cooking. 
Bake, broil and grill whenever possible and take advantage of the microwave, 
another low-fat cooking method, Saracino said. These changes are practical and 
leave room in the diet for favorite foods, on occasion, as "a special treat." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very easy way to obtain the goal of a healthy diet," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer the more scientific approach, it is possible to figure out 
the amount of fat in the daily diet. But you'll need to know the total fat 
content, in grams, of the foods you eat. This information is usually available 
on the product label. Or, a pamphlet, "Nutritive Value of Foods Home and Garden 
Bulletin 72" is available by mail from the Government Printing Office 
Bookstore, 505 S. Flower St., Level C, Los Angeles, 90071. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to assess a day's diet: 
</P>
<P>
On a balanced diet, the day's intake should be made up from foods from a 
variety of sources, with distributions of 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein and 30% 
fat as optimal. In order to determine how close you are to the goal for fat 
convert the grams of fat supplied by a food into fat calories. But product 
labels typically don't provide fat information in terms of fat calories. 
Instead, product packages give the amount of fat in grams. An average 
croissant, for example, contains 235 calories and 12 grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
Fat is higher calorie-wise than any other element in the diet. Carbohydrates 
and protein, for example, each offer four calories for every gram consumed, 
whereas, every gram of fat is equivalent to nine calories. Multiply the grams 
of fat by nine and the croissant derives almost half of its calories from fat. 
</P>
<P>
The process for evaluating an entire day is similar. 
</P>
<P>
First, determine desired calorie intake from the Recommended Dietary 
Allowances, or total how many calories you eat each day -- making sure to 
include every morsel you eat including snacks and tastes of foods. 
</P>
<P>
On a 1,500 calorie-per-day diet, for example, based on the 30% fat allotment, 
you are allowed 450 calories from fat. Then, when you divide 450 by nine (the 
number of calories in each gram) you may eat up to 50 grams of fat for the day 
and still fall within the 30% fat range. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the diet based on the entire day is preferred to evaluating the 
amount of fat calories in individual foods because some items, a cheeseburger 
for instance, may be well above the 50% fat range -- individually -- but it 
still fits into a sensible diet when balanced with low fat foods the remainder 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
To help with either process, here are some guidelines for daily food choices, 
which were adapted by ADA from a USDA handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Breads, cereals and other whole grain and enriched products -- choose six 
to 11 servings each day from among the following: one slice bread; one-half 
hamburger bun or English muffin; three to four small or two large crackers; 
one-half cup cooked cereal, pasta or rice; or one ounce ready-to-eat cereal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fruits -- choose two to four servings each day from among the following: 
three-quarters cup juice; one medium fresh fruit; or one-half cup fresh or 
canned fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vegetables -- choose three to five servings each day from among the 
following: one-half cup cooked or chopped raw vegetables or one cup leafy raw 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Meat, poultry, fish and alternates -- choose two to three servings each day 
from among the following: a total of five to seven ounces cooked lean meat, 
poultry, fish or other protein source; one ounce alternative protein source 
such as one egg; one-half cup cooked beans; or two tablespoons peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Milk, cheese and yogurt -- men choose two to three servings; women, three 
to four servings; children, two or more servings; teens and pregnant or breast 
feeding women, four servings: one cup milk; one cup buttermilk, one cup yogurt, 
1 1/2 ounces natural cheese; or two ounces process cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fats, sweets and alcohol -- limit intake.

SOVIET UNION PUTS AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY AT THE TOP OF ITS SHOPPING LIST; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: THE U. S. MAY HAVE BEEN THE LEADING WESTERN EXPORTER OF AGRICULTURAL 
GOODS TO THE SOVIET UNION, BUT NOW IT'S PRIVATE INDUSTRY'S FOOD-PROCESSING 
EXPERTISE AND EQUIPMENT THE SOVIETS SEEK.

<P>
"Why," the Soviet visitor wondered, "do you have four brands of baked beans?" 
Touring an ordinary Giant Food store in suburban Washington with George 
Melnykovich, president of the Food Processing Machinery and Supplies Assn., the 
Soviet was awed by the plentitude of food yet puzzled by its redundancy. 
</P>
<P>
We probably don't need any more brands of baked beans, but that's competition. 
On the other hand, the Soviet Union could use far more than the Bolshoi Maks 
introduced to Russians recently when McDonald's opened its first Moscow outlet. 
</P>
<P>
"Food remains one of the number one issues for the Soviets. The stories of 
lines and shortages are not exaggerated. They are quite real," say Melnykovich, 
who also helps direct the Food Industries International Trade Council, a joint 
effort of Melnykovich's Washington-based group, the National Food Processors 
Assn., leading food and food-machinery companies and the Soviet State 
Agro-Industrial Committee (USSR GOSAGROPROM). 
</P>
<P>
"There just isn't anything they don't need," said Fritz Friday, president of 
Friday Canning Co., in New Richmond, Wis., and a member of FIITC who led a 
delegation of American food companies to the Soviet Union two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Milk gets fed to hogs because it spoils before it can get to people, vegetables 
rot before they can be processed, packages don't close properly. Only 19% of 
Soviet food-processing enterprises are operating at current demand levels, and 
the rest of the plants will need about 8,000 pieces of equipment to get up to 
desired production, according to Food Engineering magazine. 
</P>
<P>
So while the United States government has generally been the leading Western 
exporter of agricultural goods (mostly grain) to the Soviet Union since the 
mid-1970s, now it's private industry's food-processing expertise and equipment 
the Soviets seek. They need canning machinery (80% of processed food is sold in 
glass), refrigeration units, storage facilities -- the whole infrastructure of 
a food system, according to Melnykovich. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not ready yet for aseptic packaging or microwaves. We need to get them 
into the '50s before we can get them to the '90s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While there are still many obstacles to overcome in doing business with the 
Soviet Union (it took McDonald's 14 years to turn its project into reality), 
American food companies are gearing up, exploring joint ventures and angling to 
be near the head of the line as perestroika unfolds. The risks of such 
endeavors are as great as the uncertainty of Soviet reforms. But with a needy 
population of 287 million, the opportunity is tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the potential size of the market that's attractive. It's the biggest and 
most important market in Eastern Europe," said Karl von der Heyden, chief 
financial officer for RJR Nabisco. Nabisco is in the midst of bringing Ritz 
crackers and Triscuits to the Soviet Union; the company is currently involved 
in building two bakeries near Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
It may be the biggest market in the Eastern bloc, but probably the toughest to 
enter right now because of the size of the problems. For that reason firms such 
as the Campbell Soup Co. are eyeing other Eastern European countries where 
international competition for investment is nonetheless fierce. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "it obviously behooves any manufacturer to be ready" to do 
business with the Soviet Union, said Don Lane, an industry manager for Procter 
&amp; Schwartz, the world's largest manufacturer of conveyor drying machines. 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers are more ready than others. Pepsi-Co. has been bottling its 
soft drinks in the Soviet Union via franchise arrangements since 1973. With 24 
plants already producing more than nine billion bottles of soda a year, Pepsi 
has "pretty aggressive plans" for further expansion, according to company 
spokesman Barry Holt. Since the ruble is not convertible and since the Soviets 
lack Western currency, the Soviets have been trading Stolichnaya vodka in 
exchange. Pepsi also has exclusive rights to all other Soviet alcoholic 
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
FMC International, which has an office in Moscow, has helped build several food 
plants in the Soviet Union, including ones that make baby food, tomato paste 
and apple-juice concentrate. The company is currently negotiating for a canned 
and frozen pea plant. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to the arrangement with Pepsi, the products are sold via counter-trade. 
For example, the processing equipment to make tomato paste is given to the 
Soviets in exchange for a percentage of the finished product. Those products 
are then sold in the world market for Western currency, which unfortunately 
keeps them from being consumed by the Soviets, according to Jurgen Buschek, 
manager of marketing and sales for FMC International. 
</P>
<P>
FMC International also recently bought processing equipment for making raisins 
from Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Co. in Fresno, and then sold it to 
three plants in Uzbekistan, a central republic. According to the California 
firm's president, Larry Hagopian, the deal was made a few years ago, after 
President Mikhail Gorbachev ordered reforms that took a hefty chunk of grapes 
out of production for alcoholic beverages and put them into foods such as 
raisins and grape juice. Commercial Manufacturing is also building more 
equipment for the Soviets through FMC. 
</P>
<P>
Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream has plans to open a scoop shop by the end of summer 
in Petrozavodsk, Karelia, north of Moscow. The Vermont-based ice-cream firm 
plans to purchase Soviet gift items with rubles from sales of its ice cream, 
then bring the goods back to this country and sell them in its scoop shops -- 
which they will then plow back into the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
And Edward Cohen, owner of Washington's Tabard Inn, recently returned from the 
Soviet Union where negotiations continued on Kartoshka Trust, a joint venture 
with a Soviet agricultural cooperative that will produce Tabard Farm potato 
chips there. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies are taking a hard look, although in typical capitalist form, 
are not eager to talk about it. "Obviously, Macy's doesn't tell Gimbels" what 
it's doing, said Howard Gochburg, vice president for logistics and custom 
products at Land O'Lakes, who said the cooperative is in the "exploratory 
stages" of ventures with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
To help facilitate and encourage food business between the two countries, the 
FIITC was formed last year. Protocol between the two countries has already been 
signed, and in later, 30 leading Soviet food-industry policy-makers will come 
to this country for a short course on the American food industry. 
</P>
<P>
After a few days in Washington, the Soviets will be whisked to the University 
of Nebraska in Lincoln, where they will be acquainted with various processing 
technologies, such as those used for meat, dairy products and cereals, 
according to Steve Taylor, director of the food-processing center at the 
university. After that, the Soviets will visit American food plants to see how 
it works in practice. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a three-day conference on the future of U.S.-Soviet food industries 
will be held in Washington, with invitations to 100 Soviet food-industry 
officials and about 500 American food companies. Then, in September, the 
Soviets will host a program, which hopefully will match American companies with 
potential Soviet partners. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Commerce is also heavily involved in promoting joint food 
ventures; in fact, FIITC is the government's private-sector arm for such 
projects. The Commerce Department has sent letters to 4,000 American food and 
machinery companies to apprise them of the Soviets' needs and to encourage them 
to look into these opportunities. The letter included a "wish list" from the 
Soviets that listed among other items, production of non-alcoholic beverages 
and foods for diabetics and babies. 
</P>
<P>
FIITC and the Commerce Department hope to facilitate between 25 and 50 joint 
ventures by the end of 1990.

THE BUTCHER: COOKING CORNED BEEF THE RIGHT, MODERN WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm not sure how corned beef came to be the tradition for St. Patrick's Day, 
but indeed it is. More corned beef is sold in this country the week before and 
after St. Patrick's Day than the other 50 weeks of the year put together. It's 
not, according to the Irish Consulate in San Francisco, such a big deal in 
Ireland, but it sure is here in America. 
</P>
<P>
The corned beef that we find in today's supermarket is a different breed of cut 
than its ancestors that, incidentally, go way back to the beginning of man's 
preservation of meat, long before they even knew about corn. "Corning" is 
simply the preservation of beef by the use of salt. 
</P>
<P>
According to P. Thomas Ziegler, writing in his book "The Meat We Eat": 
"Lexicographers explain the origin of the word by referring to the 16th Century 
when the word corn was synonymous with the word grain. At that time, 
manufacturers of gunpowder used the word 'corning' to indicate that their 
product had been spread out and allowed to dry in single grains. The term 
corned was later applied to the process of curing beef by sprinkling it with 
grains of salt." Lots of salt. 
</P>
<P>
One old recipe book I inherited instructs: "Put a layer of salt over the bottom 
of the barrel, a good quarter of an inch thick. Pack in a layer of meat as 
close as you can get, then put on another layer of salt, following that with 
another layer of meat; repeat until the meat and the salt have all been packed 
in the barrel, care being used to reserve salt enough for a good layer over the 
top." That's a lot of salt -- and the corned beef that came out of the barrel 
"28 to 40 days later" was indeed salty. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before my time. Modern methods for making corned beef are not 
nearly so salty. Most call for salting or pumping the meat with a brine 
solution made with both salt and sugar -- but for nowhere near 40 days. 
</P>
<P>
Modern corned beef, the kind that comes in plastic packages at the supermarket, 
is a much more mild-mannered product with as good a flavor and far more 
nutritional value than its old ancestor, if you cook it right. The stuff they 
used to make in the barrel had to be soaked in cold water for an hour or so 
before cooking and the water changed at least once during cooking to keep it 
from being too salty. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, far too often, mild modern corned beef is cooked according to 
recipes handed down from that much saltier time. The corned beef these days 
seldom needs even rinsing, let alone a change of water. Check the label, and 
unless the instructions tell you to, don't. Rinsing and changing the water only 
serves to wash away a lot of goodness both in terms of flavor and nutrition. 
There are a lot of nutrients in the juices that are inside the package so try 
not to waste them. 
</P>
<P>
Many brands are packed in a plastic that can go right into the pot to be cooked 
in their own juices, so be sure to read the label before you open the package. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, do not throw the juices down the drain. You paid for them, they 
are a nutritional part of the product and, to a large extent, that's where the 
flavor is, so use them. Add them to the water you cook the meat in -- do not 
change the water. Then use the same broth to cook vegetables. That way you get 
all the good that you can get out of the juices. 
</P>
<P>
Corned beef is one of the meat items that should be purchased in a large 
quantity. Like the Thanksgiving turkey or the Christmas roast, always buy a 
bigger one than you need because the best part is the leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
If you want something really hot, try Bubble and Squeak or Red Flannel Hash. 
</P>
<P>
BUBBLE AND SQUEAK 
</P>
<P>
Mix together equal parts of leftover cooked potatoes, cabbage and corned beef 
all chopped fine. Mash mixture together and fry in small amount of butter until 
brown and crisp on both sides. Then stir with fork until crisp exterior is 
incorporated as bits within whole. Fry again on both sides until brown. Repeat, 
frying and mashing with fork until Bubble and Squeak is full of crispy brown 
bits. 
</P>
<P>
The name, it is said, comes from the noise it makes as it cooks. I must always 
be doing something wrong for my Bubble and Squeak is always quiet -- delicious 
but quiet. 
</P>
<P>
RED FLANNEL HASH 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound salt pork, diced 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 cups chopped corned beef 
</P>
<P>
6 boiled potatoes, peeled and chopped 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Saute salt pork until fat has rendered. Remove browned pork with slotted spoon 
and discard 1/2 fat. 
</P>
<P>
Add onion to pan and saute until tender. Add corned beef, potatoes, cream and 
salt pork. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Cook over moderate heat 30 to 40 minutes until bottom of hash is lightly 
browned. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

1ST HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANT IN S.D. COUNTY PERFORMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A desperately ill nurse from Laguna Hills was reported in critical but stable 
condition on Wednesday after surgeons at UC San Diego Medical Center completed 
the first combination heart-lung transplant ever attempted in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Renee Williams, 34, a registered nurse at Saddleback Memorial Medical 
Center in Laguna Hills, "should be able to lead a normal life" if her recovery 
continues smoothly, Dr. Paul Jagger, a medical center spokesman, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was hospitalized in January for treatment of a relatively rare, 
congenital heart defect that had caused severe and irreversible damage to her 
lungs. "It's safe to say that she had less than a year to live," Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with her progress," Jagger said. "Things went very smoothly 
for the first procedure (of this type) here. . . . Oxygenation (of the lungs) 
is excellent as . . . (are) cardiac functions." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors began the complex, five-hour operation late Tuesday night and completed 
it early Wednesday morning, Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams on Wednesday "regained consciousness for a time and she was aware that 
she'd had the operation," according to a family friend. "Her doctors were 
ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who was scheduled to remain in the recovery room for about 24 hours, 
will stay in an intensive care ward for at least a week, and be hospitalized 
for several more weeks, Jagger said. She will remain on a "continuous 
medication program" that is designed to keep her body's immune system from 
rejecting the transplanted organs, Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 31 hospitals are conducting heart-lung transplants. More than 800 
of the operations have been conducted worldwide. Medical centers at UCSD, 
Stanford and UCLA are the only California institutions to have completed 
heart-lung transplants. Cedar-Sinai Hospital and St. Vincent Medical Center in 
Los Angeles area have completed lung transplants but have not done combination 
heart-lung transplants. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's surgery team was led by Dr. Stuart W. Jamieson, who has directed or 
performed more than 50 heart-lung transplants while working at other 
facilities, Jagger said. Jamieson and his transplant team moved to UCSD last 
July from the Minnesota Heart and Lung Institute. The transplant team includes 
Drs. Michael P. Kaye, Jolene M. Kriett and Riyad Y. Tarazi, and clinical nurse 
specialists Ann Hayden and Rebecca Robert. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, survival rates for patients who have undergone heart-lung 
transplants average about 60%, Jagger said. Jamieson's patients at the 
Minnesota facility have a 75% survival rate, Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was one of three patients awaiting heart-lung transplants at San Diego 
hospitals. Both UCSD and Sharp Hospital recently created teams capable of 
performing heart-lung and lung transplants. UCSD also has several patients 
awaiting lung transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was placed on the heart-lung transplant list in January. Last October 
she was diagnosed as having Eisenmenger's syndrome, a rare, congenital heart 
defect that ruins the lungs. A hole between the two chambers of her heart 
caused it to pump harder than usual, creating pressure that was gradually 
destroying her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Jagger said Eisenmenger's syndrome is "almost always" diagnosed in infancy or 
early childhood. At that point it is possible to repair the heart and avoid 
irreversible damage to the patient's lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Because combination heart-lung donors are extremely rare, Williams' physicians 
were ready to perform a complex operation involving the repair of Williams' 
heart and the transplantation of a single lung, which is easier to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping that we could get (at least) one lung, (but) we had the 
opportunity to get two lungs and a heart to go with it," Jagger said. "If only 
one lung had become available we would have tried to repair the congenital 
defect in the heart." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD officials on Wednesday declined to divulge any details about the donor. 
</P>
<P>
The operation, which cost about $150,000, was not covered by Williams' medical 
insurance policy, according to Michael Stringer, director of UCSD's hospitals 
and clinics. However, Williams' family, friends and co-workers are sponsoring a 
fund-raising campaign that, with matching funds from Saddleback Memorial, has 
collected $118,000. The medical center is "committed to cover any difference 
that remains," Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Gary Troxel, who just weeks earlier became UCSD's first heart 
transplant patient, was released on Wednesday morning. Troxel, a 25-year-old 
construction worker from Riverside County, is in good condition following the 
Feb. 26 operation, Jagger said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an important day for San Diego and the region," Stringer said. "It 
represents the availability of an important new medical program for critically 
ill patients." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's transplant program now includes hearts, heart-lung combinations, lungs, 
corneas and bone marrow, Stringer said.

reported to be progressing well after the five-hour surgery. DAVID McNEW / Los

A delegation from Bonn was in Washington earlier this month to discuss 
transferring the Berlin Documents Center to West German control, officials 
said. The center, in the U.S. sector of Berlin, is run by the State Department. 
The United States has agreed in principle to hand over the center after copying 
the documents, said a State Department official. But the Justice Department, 
which prepares court cases against suspected Nazis, is opposed, sources said.

ENCINITAS MAY DECLARE CRISIS ON MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throwing up its hands to what it calls a rising tide of undocumented aliens, 
Encinitas City Council voted late Tuesday to explore declaring a local state of 
emergency within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The council asked Fire Chief Robert LaMarsh to research the declaration, which 
in effect admits that efforts by local government have failed to solve problems 
created by undocumented workers sleeping in canyons and soliciting work on city 
streets, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The directive was part of a new migrant strategy that includes a possible 
curbside hiring ordinance and a directive to ask Congress to conduct hearings 
in North County regarding the growing presence of undocumented aliens from 
Mexico and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
LaMarsh, who co-authored the key migrant report presented to the council, will 
report back within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, he said, is a last-ditch effort by frustrated city officials to 
impress upon state and federal officials that more help is needed to fight a 
problem created by them. 
</P>
<P>
"Encinitas last night determined that the city is unable to cope with the tide 
of undocumented aliens caused by open borders," LaMarsh said. "We looked at our 
history and our energies, and what we found is that we tried this and it didn't 
work, and that we tried that and it didn't work, either. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the doors of all the people who were supposed to have the solutions 
to the problem. Every one of them had their arms crossed, either saying 'It's 
not my job' or that they didn't have the manpower to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Warren Shafer said Wednesday that, by declaring a state of 
emergency, the city would accomplish two things. "We're helping to raise what 
we hope will be national attention to this issue in our community. 
</P>
<P>
"And hopefully it will also avail ourselves to any state and federal resources 
that may be available to provide a solution. We don't know if it will work in 
the long run. But what we've been trying in the short run hasn't worked to 
focus attention on our problem either." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation of the city's migrant strategy is a 105-page report featuring 26 
recommendations, including the development of a bilingual brochure with 
information on the criminal justice system and providing incentives to growers 
and businesses to develop low-income housing for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
It also includes a curbside hiring ordinance that would, in part, impose fines 
on employers who hired workers from local street corners. Admitting that its 
3-month-old employment center had stagnated in attempts to locate jobs for 
documented workers, the council directed city staff to research the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Shafer said the city will send representatives to Orange County to examine 
similar laws in Costa Mesa and at least two other communities. 
</P>
<P>
Migrant-rights groups, however, have said that the Costa Mesa ordinance is 
being challenged on First Amendment grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Both we and the American Civil Liberties Union will be closely monitoring any 
of the city's proposed actions along that line," said Claudia Smith, an 
attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), a migrant-rights group. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, several other council actions sent a message that it could 
indeed be a very long summer on the streets of Encinitas, migrant advocates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to dismiss two recommendations included in the report, 
including a plan to supply day laborers with bus tokens or van service to help 
get them to the city's employment center, located on an isolated stretch of El 
Camino Real near Olivenhain Road. 
</P>
<P>
Another rejected suggestion would have created a task force, using social 
service and church organizations, to develop migrant education and housing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Carranza, transients issues coordinator for the city, said the council 
doesn't believe it owes migrant laborers a ride to work. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt it was the responsibility of the workers to get to the job center by 
themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Carranza said, the council was in no mood to create yet another 
migrant task force, instead believing that some church organizations were, on 
the contrary, part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The council felt that some of the religious organizations in the community 
were exacerbating the problem," she said. "By giving away free food and 
clothing to the workers, they felt it perpetuated problems in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Because as long as these people know they have someone to give them food and 
clothing, they're going to stay here. And that's not the goal of the council." 
</P>
<P>
CRLA attorney Smith said the workers are attracted by employment opportunities, 
not bag lunches. 
</P>
<P>
"These people come here because there are jobs available," she said. "They 
don't come because they know they're going to get a bag lunch and a blanket 
from any migrant group." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also said she didn't buy the city's argument that migrants are attracted 
to Encinitas more than to any other North County community. She has questioned 
the city's claim that more than 600 Guatemalans live in camps within Encinitas 
limits; she places the figure at about 150. 
</P>
<P>
"I also didn't believe it when the Border Patrol spokesman told the council 
Tuesday night that 32% of all migrants taken into custody in the North County 
were arrested in Encinitas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I questioned him after the meeting, he admitted that the statistic really 
didn't mean that much and was so high because Encinitas had put so much 
pressure for Border Patrol activity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the point," she said. "It didn't mean that there were so many more 
migrants here. It's just all part of the smoke-screen-and-mirror effect the 
city is trying to use to show it has an undocumented alien problem."

OCEANSIDE AMPHITHEATER PROPOSAL APPEARS DOOMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A groundswell of neighborhood opposition and lack of political support at City 
Hall have apparently killed a proposed $27-million, 25,000-seat outdoor 
amphitheater in Oceanside, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Backers felt the plan by La Jolla-based Spectator Corp. would help establish 
Oceanside as a North County cultural-entertainment center, but the scheme has 
faltered even before a formal application to build it. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, we do not expect to see this project go any further," 
Mayor Larry Bagley told about 100 people who crowded into a City Council 
session Wednesday to complain that the amphitheater would bring noise, traffic 
congestion and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley said he would "bet the odds are probably 98-to-1" against Spectator 
Corp. proceeding with the project since 1,600 residents who live near the 
proposed 67-acre site at busy El Camino Real and Oceanside Boulevard signed 
petitions against the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Hal Kolker, a former vice president of the San Diego Clippers 
franchise and a former vice president of the San Diego Sports Arena, envisioned 
bringing rock concerts, symphonies and Broadway-style performances to 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Bagley, Kolker was discouraged by recent meetings with the 
city staff and council members. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside's officials informed Spectator Corp. it would need a complete 
environmental impact report, and must win both a general plan amendment and a 
zoning ordinance change to use the sand pit area for an amphitheater. Further, 
a site reclamation plan would be required. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kolker reportedly wanted to open the amphitheater by spring 1991, 
Bagley said "there's no way he can possible meet the deadline" with such 
extensive city requirements. Beside the "considerable community opposition," 
Bagley doubted Spectator Corp. could get a council majority on his side. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kolker or his assistant, Ray Taki, could be reached Wednesday to 
confirm the Oceanside plan is dead. But Bagley said "I would offer my strong 
opinion there is no way he can proceed with that parcel of property." 
</P>
<P>
Elated audience members left the council meeting without giving their planned 
presentation against the development. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara De La Torre, who started the neighborhood movement, said after Bagley's 
announcement that she and other volunteers collected 1,600 signatures in two 
weeks after area residents heard about the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
"Oceanside is looking for symphonies, operas," said De La Torre. "Most of the 
concerts would be pop, hard rock, heavy metal." 
</P>
<P>
She said many homes, including housing for seniors, are located near the site 
and residents would be treated to entertainment whether they liked it or not. 
"I don't care who it is, I don't want to hear them in my back yard. This is an 
open-air amphitheater and the principle of sound is it travels." 
</P>
<P>
When De La Torre heard about the proposal, she called police, city officials 
and homeowners in other locations that have amphitheaters, including Costa Mesa 
in Orange County, and heard stories about noise and disruption. 
</P>
<P>
In November, one Costa Mesa woman settled her six-year legal battle against 
loud concerts at the 18,500-seat Pacific Amphitheater. The suit also involved a 
neighborhood group trying to force a reduction in concert decibel levels. 
</P>
<P>
Kolker said during a recent interview with The Times that the Oceanside 
amphitheater was part of a plan to build outdoor facilities in Palm Beach, 
Fla., and Chicago, and to restore an indoor theater in Chicago. He aspires to 
become a national entertainment industry figure. 
</P>
<P>
Spectator Corp. has a contract to buy the sand pit site from Collins 
Development that hinged on approval for the amphitheater, which was expected to 
generate up to 8,000 vehicles during peak attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The developer gave informal presentations to Oceanside business groups and 
appeared to be raising some enthusiasm. Even Bagley said at one point that the 
amphitheater would benefit the city by bringing quality entertainment and 
boosting the city's tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley "was all for it" said De La Torre. But much had changed by Wednesday, 
when the mayor announced the amphitheater had virtually no chance of getting 
community or council support. 
</P>
<P>
City spokesman Larry Bauman said "considering the breadth and intensity of the 
political opposition, they'd really have an uphill battle."

A LIFE-STYLE BATTLE IN DESCANSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Descanso is so small it doesn't even have a supermarket, says Sherry Rusch, who 
lives in the bucolic town that lies at the foot of the Cleveland National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Life without a supermarket would be inconceivable and inconvenient for many 
people, but Rusch and a group of neighbors say the simple life Descanso offers 
suits them just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep Descanso a quiet, beautiful place," Rusch said. "Keep it true 
to its name, which means 'a place of rest' in Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
But Rusch and some of her neighbors fear that a recent change in zoning 
standards in the heart of town could lead to commercialization that would put 
an end to their tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors -- against the unanimous 
recommendations of the Descanso planning group, the county Planning Commission 
and its own Planning Department staff -- last October approved the request of 
Paul Barkley, co-owner of Perkins Corner Store, to change the zoning for land 
behind the store from residential to commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Appalled by the supervisors' action, Rusch and Diane Janssen formed Descanso 
Residents for Rural Preservation. The grass-roots organization is lobbying the 
supervisors to reverse their decision. 
</P>
<P>
The group contends that the supervisors received inaccurate information used in 
making their decision, and it hopes for a rehearing. 
</P>
<P>
So far its efforts have been futile, and last Sunday, the group held a 
neighborhood rally in an attempt to drum up community support. 
</P>
<P>
The group says such support is needed to get the supervisors' attention. In 
February, the group received a helping hand from its representative, Supervisor 
George Bailey, who asked that the board consider a rehearing. But Bailey's 
motion failed to receive a second from his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"By not seconding (Bailey's) motion, the board basically said, 'We don't even 
want to consider new evidence for a rehearing,' " said Dianne Jacob, Bailey's 
chief of staff. "The board apparently feels the issue has been decided and 
there's no point in opening it up again. But (Bailey) felt they should at least 
be given an opportunity to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
Rusch couldn't agree more. 
</P>
<P>
"The County Board of Supervisors granted a rezone in the center of town, at 
Perkins Corner . . . something our citizens didn't want, something our local 
planning group didn't want . . . " Rusch said. 
</P>
<P>
"Something the board's own Planning Department recommended against. They 
haven't even heard our arguments. We're outraged, but we're being beaten by the 
bureaucracy and we really don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey's colleagues on the board offer a collective groan when asked about the 
Descanso zoning issue, especially because the land in question is a fairly 
small parcel: 2 1/2 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"They did receive a legal and proper hearing," said John Woodard, Supervisor 
Brian Bilbray's chief of staff. Bilbray "reached his decision after he took all 
the information into consideration. These residents want to put a gate around 
their community, but the fact of the matter is that they can't. This is by no 
means a bad planning decision." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, one of three owners of Perkins Corner Store, says he's glad the board 
made its own judgment rather than rubber-stamp the local planning group's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The planning group in Descanso is not an elected group," Barkley said. "They 
appoint themselves and are against just about everything. I don't think they 
represent the broad view of the people. They support a minority view which 
believes in a stringent no-growth policy." 
</P>
<P>
However, some Descanso residents say they are outraged that their planning 
group was ignored and upset that the board rejected its own Planning 
Department's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials also expressed surprise at the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't happen very often . . . It rarely happens," said Ann Ewing, a 
principal planner with the department, referring to the board overruling a 
recommendation agreed on by all three planning groups. Ewing presented the 
three conclusions before the supervisors at the October hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"For that matter, the Board of Supervisors agrees with the (local) planning 
group more often than not," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Planning Commission was concerned about (traffic) circulation, that the 
roads weren't big enough to handle more traffic; there were also septic and 
drainage concerns -- that they were not adequate -- and there was concern that 
the community character would change . . . that (the project) was too 
commercial. They denied approval on those grounds," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
But the supervisors say such concerns will be addressed because of development 
conditions required as part of the project, regulating building design and 
layout, parking, landscaping and preservation of existing oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years, Barkley says, he's owned the 3.5-acre lot on which Perkins Corner 
Store sits, building up the site without complaints from neighbors. The current 
commotion puzzles Barkley, who says he has no sinister development plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite well known that eventually we're going to build 10,000 square feet 
of additional commercial space," he said. "And we'll lease the space to beauty 
shops, barber shops, hardware stores . . . . Those are the types of services 
we're hoping to provide.

CAMARILLO OKS SALE OF BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Camarillo City Council on Wednesday approved the creation of a tax district 
and the sale of up to $31 million in bonds to pay for road and sewer 
improvements, taking a step toward major development on vacant land in the 
western part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 0, with one member absent, to form the district near 
Camarillo Airport, clearing the way for developments that city officials have 
already approved on about 600 acres nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It was Camarillo's largest planned borrowing for improvements since 1987, when 
the entire city treasury of $25 million was lost in high-risk trading ventures. 
</P>
<P>
There are only three major property owners in the new district, said City 
Manager William Little. 
</P>
<P>
A separate vote of the three property owners is required before the agency can 
be created, and all are expected to approve the move in a mail ballot in the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Greeley, the city's director of engineering services, said the three 
properties that will make up the new district, called the West Camarillo 
Community Services District No. 1, are: 
</P>
<P>
* A tract north of the Central Avenue-Ventura Freeway interchange owned by 
Pacific Land &amp; Golf, an Orange County-based company that is planning 
Spanish Hills, a private country club, golf course and residential project. 
</P>
<P>
* The Kohl-Leonard Camarillo Center, a proposed business and commercial complex 
south of the freeway between Las Posas Road and Carmen Drive. 
</P>
<P>
* A 41-acre tract just east of the airport owned by Harry Gelles of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The $100-million Spanish Hills project will take up 431 acres of the 600 acres 
involved. The development will be patterned after a recently completed country 
club in San Juan Capistrano called Marbella, said J. Porter Barton, a vice 
president for Pacific Land &amp; Golf. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to sell the bonds in increments, Little said. In the first 
phase, the city will sell $14.5 million in bonds to be used to expand and 
rebuild deteriorating sewer mains. In later phases, the city expects to sell 
more bonds to widen Central Avenue at the Ventura Freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
"As further development occurs, there will be a need to issue more bonds for 
storm drainage improvements and bridges," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has only recently reached a point where it can consider such capital 
projects. In 1987, Camarillo put improvements such as road widening on hold 
after the former treasurer and investments officer lost the city's entire $25 
million treasury through high-risk trading in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the city announced that it was back in the black, with $384,067 in 
the treasury, up from a deficit of more than $3 million in early 1989. The 
turnaround followed two years of no-frills budgets that omitted capital 
improvements, cut back on maintenance and did not allow for replacement of city 
staff members as they quit. 
</P>
<P>
Greeley said the city is ready to begin working on design of the sewers, sewer 
pump stations and force mains on the improvements approved Wednesday, pending 
approval by the three property owners. City officials hope to have the sewer 
improvements completed in 18 to 24 months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect construction of the projects to begin in 1991.

TRUSTEE IN DEBT TO CASINOS, OFFICIALS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: TOM ELY, WHO IS RUNNING FOR COUNTY SUPERVISOR, DENIES INCURRING THE 
DEBTS. BUT AUTHORITIES SAY NEVADA OFFICIALS HAVE COMPILED A LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Community College District Trustee Tom Ely has incurred about $40,000 
in gambling debts at more than half a dozen Nevada casinos, law enforcement 
sources have told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, 54, who is running for the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, owes the 
money to some of the best known casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, including the 
Aladdin, the Dunes and the Sands, the law enforcement sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times learned that Nevada officials have compiled a list of alleged Ely 
gambling debts that includes $9,000 to the Aladdin, $5,000 to the Dunes, $3,500 
to the Sands, $4,700 to Maxim's and $2,000 to Bally's. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about those amounts, Las Vegas police Detective Ned Brodeur on 
Wednesday confirmed that there is such a list. But he declined to go into 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
"That's true," Brodeur said. "You've done your homework." 
</P>
<P>
The latest disclosures of alleged gambling debts by Ely followed a report last 
week that he owed $3,000 to the Edgewater Hotel and Casino of Laughlin, Nev., 
and a subsequent revelation that he is being sued by another casino, the Golden 
Nugget in Las Vegas, over $8,000 in alleged debts. 
</P>
<P>
Brodeur said Wednesday that only one of the casinos, the Edgewater, has filed 
any complaint with the police. He added that the complaint was dropped this 
week after the debt was settled. 
</P>
<P>
Most casinos allow indebted gamblers a grace period before seeking police 
intervention, Brodeur said, although the debts would be listed with the State 
Gaming Control Board of Nevada during periodic casino audits. 
</P>
<P>
Ely denied Wednesday that he had incurred the gambling debts, adding that his 
attorney has advised him not to comment because "there's all kinds of legal 
action coming." 
</P>
<P>
Ely said he will remain in the supervisorial race to represent the 4th 
District, which includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Rosa 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has anywhere near the experience I do," said Ely, who has been an 
elected community college trustee, a job that pays $400 a month, since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The state Gaming Control Board of Nevada refused Wednesday to comment on Ely's 
alleged indebtedness. None of the casinos would comment publicly either, citing 
policies guaranteeing confidentiality for clients. 
</P>
<P>
Brodeur said the Edgewater Hotel and Casino's complaint against Ely was for 
$3,000 in gambling debts that Ely had incurred last June. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ely told The Times that he had settled his debts with the Edgewater 
in June "in cash." 
</P>
<P>
But Brodeur said the casino notified him Wednesday that Ely had sent the $3,000 
by express mail over the weekend after learning that a warrant for his arrest 
would be issued unless he immediately settled the debt. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a million stories in the Naked City, and this is just one of them," 
Brodeur said. 
</P>
<P>
Ely also told The Times on Sunday that he did not have a gambling problem and 
had not visited Laughlin, Nev., since June, when he and his wife, Ingrid, 
played blackjack and the slot machines at the Edgewater. 
</P>
<P>
Brodeur disputed that account Wednesday, saying Ely had incurred the bulk of 
the debts in Las Vegas after visiting Laughlin in June. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed against Ely by the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino on Feb. 20 
also refers to a later Nevada gambling debt incurred by Ely in July, charging 
that he signed five "markers" for $8,000, to be drawn on his account at Simi 
Valley Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that when the casino attempted to collect the debt, it found 
that Ely's account at the bank had been closed. A source at the bank told The 
Times that Ely's account was closed by the bank because it was overdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees on the five-member Ventura Community College Board said Wednesday that 
they are concerned that the gambling allegations against Ely will damage the 
board's reputation. Two trustees said Wednesday that Ely should consider 
resigning or face possible impeachment proceedings or a recall. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a problem with Tom's credibility, and that disturbs me," 
Trustee Greg Cole said. "I have some grave problems with this -- public office 
is a public trust." 
</P>
<P>
College Trustee President Greg Kampf said he is concerned about the impact that 
the gambling allegations may have on the college board. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not a positive thing for the board," he said. "It's not going 
to add to the district's reputation." 
</P>
<P>
A flamboyant figure who often appears at board meetings festooned in gold rings 
and chains, Ely is a former board president who refers to himself as "Dr. Ely" 
in official correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has a law degree from Ventura College of Law but has not passed the state 
bar exam, according to the California State Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Former trustees contacted by The Times recalled that Ely once shocked the board 
by revealing that he carried a handgun in his briefcase. Ely said Wednesday 
that he had a permit to carry a concealed weapon to protect himself in case his 
car broke down on a dark country road. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has run for public office before. In 1986, he lost a bid to become mayor of 
Simi Valley.

OFFICER'S SHOOTING OF ARMED WOMAN FOUND JUSTIFIABLE BY D.A.'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police officer was justified in wounding a woman while she was in 
her house and armed with a shotgun, the district attorney's office said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The officer who shot the woman, Anthony D. Castellini, was one of four officers 
who responded to a call Nov. 23 that a woman, Judy Hunt Ellis, had been beaten 
up by her ex-boyfriend and was threatening to shoot him, according to a report 
issued by Deputy District Atty. Michael R. Pent. 
</P>
<P>
When the officers arrived about 7 p.m., a witness identified Ellis as she was 
entering her home in the 3900 block of 31st Street in North Park. Two officers 
went to the front door and one of them, Edmund L. Palumbo, spoke to Ellis 
through a screen door, trying to persuade her to come out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Castellini and another officer watched Ellis through partially open 
blinds. According to the report, Castellini told investigators that he saw 
Ellis sitting on a chair in the living room. Leaning against the chair was a 
double-barrel, 20-gauge shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Palumbo told investigators that Ellis was crying and sounded very distressed. 
For several minutes Palumbo talked to Ellis, while she alternated between going 
to the front door and slamming it and returning to where the shotgun was. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Ellis picked up the shotgun and started walking toward the front door. 
Palumbo saw her through a glass porthole in the door and yelled: "She's going 
for the gun!" 
</P>
<P>
Castellini said he yelled at her to drop the gun and then "fired his 
9-millimeter pistol eight times in rapid succession through the window." Ellis 
was hit once in the buttocks and once in the right hip. A bullet lodged in her 
pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
Castellini told investigators that he fired because "I felt she (Ellis) was 
very unstable . . . . She didn't listen to our instructions that she was not to 
pick the gun . . . . I thought she was going to fire at the door . . . . I have 
some experience with shotguns and if she would have fired through the door, the 
window, or the wall, she would have possibly shot one of the officers or 
myself. That is one of the main reasons why I shot. I think she was definitely 
a threat. I shot to eliminate that threat." 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Castellini's actions were justified because "when 
Ellis picked up (the) shotgun and began to turn in the direction of the front 
door and Officer Palumbo she posed a very real and immediate threat to all the 
officers at the scene." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' ex-boyfriend, Robert A. O'Donnell, later told police that he had broken 
into her home earlier that night and had found her hiding in a closet. The two 
fought, and he hit her nose with his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis told investigators she knew police were outside and that she was upset 
and scared. She said she picked up the shotgun to take it to her bedroom and 
was not trying to shoot the officer. 
</P>
<P>
The report states that the shotgun was discharged once, but investigators could 
not determine if the discharge was "intentional, accidental, or reflexive." 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1989, Castellini shot and wounded a man while answering a domestic 
violence call, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Rooten. In that incident, Nels S. 
Peterson was shot in the right shoulder at a house in the 4400 block of Greene 
Street after pointing a 12-gauge shotgun at the officer. The report issued in 
August also declared that shooting to be justified.

SCHOOL BOARD SCRAPS BUSINESS SERVICES JOB

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Paula Union High School District Board of Trustees, in an effort to 
comply with state and county recommendations, has unanimously voted to 
eliminate the position of assistant superintendent for business services as of 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 members of the community attended a meeting Tuesday to show their 
support for Robert Villa, who holds the job, and to try to persuade the board 
to vote in favor of retaining him. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Bustillos, local California School Employees Assn. president, who said 
she spoke for those assembled, stated that she found it "hard to understand 
some of the things the board does. . . . Is this the reward for doing a good 
job?" 
</P>
<P>
Hope Mata, an instructional aide, said: "We so quickly forget and make 
decisions that affect how we feel here at school. Is this a vendetta? I don't 
think so , but consider all he has done for the district. . . . He handled so 
many jobs under pressure and didn't give up. Make your decision in good 
conscience." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Donna Nelson replied that the decision was by no means a vendetta, 
and added that all the members appreciate Villa's work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been lost without him," Nelson said. She explained the move as 
simply cost-effective, saying no district the size of Santa Paula can afford to 
support three top administrative posts. The other two are principal and 
superintendent. AMELIA CHAFFEE

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $1.4-MILLION PAYMENT OKD FOR MAN HIT BY 
GOLF BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee has given preliminary approval to a 
$1.4-million settlement for a truck driver who claimed that the brain damage he 
suffered was caused by an errant golf ball from a city course. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Coutts sued the city after the ball went awry on Oct. 23, 1987, from the 
popular Harding Golf Course in Griffith Park and hit his 18-wheel Burger King 
delivery truck on the nearby Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Coutts' attorney said the ball went through the right side window and hit 
Coutts in the head, but the official report by Assistant City Atty. John 
Neville said it shattered the windshield. Coutts lost consciousness and the 
truck careened off the freeway and rammed into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Neville told the Budget and Finance Committee that Coutts, 35, has received 
extensive medical treatment for brain damage, seizures, depression and other 
medical problems since the accident. The golfer who hit the ball was never 
found.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL OKS PLAN TO 'PRE-ZONE' U.S. LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Port Hueneme Planning Commission has approved a proposal that would 
pre-zone federal property within the city, which may be used for private or 
public development. 
</P>
<P>
The move was spurred by the Department of Community Development in an attempt 
to pre-zone land occupied by the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center, 
which covers 1,630 acres -- about 57% of the city -- to ensure that lands 
disposed of as excess property by the government become automatically subject 
to the city's land-use and zoning powers. 
</P>
<P>
"With the events unfolding in Europe bringing a heightened possibility of that 
land being 'excessed' by the Navy, it's prudent for us to put an overlay 
holding zone over all federal properties so we have land-use authority -- 
that's all we're trying to do," Director of Community Development Tom Figg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities at the base range from environmental departments to research and 
development areas, according to Assistant Planner Greg Brown, who said there 
currently is no zoning for that portion of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"About half of the base is under-utilized and it may be hard for the Navy to 
justify keeping it in the future," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will review the commission's recommendations at its March 21 
meeting, before sending the proposal to the Coastal Commission for final 
review. SCOTT LAWRENCE

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NAVY BASE WORKER PLEADS GUILTY TO TAKING 
BRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A civilian employee at the U.S. Navy base in Diego Garcia has pleaded guilty to 
taking a bribe from two business executives preparing to bid on a Navy 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Constantino, 38, pleaded guilty this week in Los Angeles to one count of 
conspiracy for taking $800 from executives of C-E Operations and Maintenance 
Services Inc., a subsidiary of Combustion Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Constantino, a Philippine national, worked in the accounting office at the 
joint U.S.-British naval base in the Indian Ocean. C-E was bidding on a 
$150-million, five-year support services contract at the base when Constantino 
took the bribe, authorities said. In return, prosecutors said, Constantino gave 
the men documents to help them prepare their contract bid. 
</P>
<P>
C-E executives Larry Hulberg, 41, of Newhall and Gordon Brymer, 58, of San 
Antonio are charged with conspiracy, bribery and theft of government property. 
Both have pleaded innocent.

CITY WORKERS TO GET A CHILLING WARNING THAT LAYOFFS MAY ARRIVE WITH SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine thousand city of San Diego employees will be notified Friday that "several 
hundred" of them might be laid off this summer because of an impending 
$60-million budget shortfall for fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to be distributed in the paychecks of all full- and part-time 
employees, City Manager John Lockwood warns that "the city may have to make 
sharp cuts in some services due to a layoff of several hundred employees that 
would be effective July 1." 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood has also ordered a hiring freeze, effective today, and restricted most 
transfers, promotions and demotions to prevent employees from "jockeying for 
positions that might be safe" from the budget ax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way I can see that we're not going to severely impact the work 
force," Lockwood said. "It's not thousands (of layoffs), but we are talking 
about several hundred positions." 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs would be the first since 1979, when passage of Proposition 13 
resulted in trims, said Rich Snapper, city personnel director. In the 
mid-1980's, loss of some federal funds prompted layoffs in one youth program, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Lockwood's memo, and ongoing publicity about the council's budget 
crunch, already has produced widespread concern among city workers, said a 
representative of the city's largest labor union, the San Diego Municipal 
Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week, we started getting a lot of calls, once the City Council decided 
not to place some of the suggested revenue-generating measures on the ballot," 
said Kathy Rollins, senior representative for the union, which represents about 
3,500 professional, clerical, administrative and technical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
But Harry Eastus, general manager of the San Diego Police Officers Assn., said 
that "even if they send those (memos) to our people, we are not terribly 
concerned at this time. I don't see them laying off any police officers" 
because of the City Council's emphasis on public safety. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the anxiety his notice will create, Lockwood said he chose the 
lesser of two evils by opting to create concern among his workers rather than 
notify them later this spring, when layoff plans would be more specific but 
employees would have less time to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
"Worse, to me, is knowing that this is in the offing, to let people go along 
thinking it will work out like it always does," Lockwood said. "This is not a 
normal year. We are going to have to go to the layoff procedures here." 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood has been warning the City Council since January that the city will be 
$60 million short of the $492 million needed to keep services at current levels 
when fiscal 1991 begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
But after four chaotic meetings last month on whether to place any new tax or 
fee increases on the June 5 ballot, the council declined to propose any 
measures to give Lockwood new revenue. In fact, they ordered him to prepare a 
$432-million budget that would require sharp cuts in library hours, park and 
recreation programs and the Planning Department staff, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
While the council still has the option of enacting tax or fee increases itself 
during budget deliberations that are scheduled to begin in May, Councilman 
Bruce Henderson and other city officials have suggested that such action might 
endanger voter approval June 5 of an increase in the city's spending ceiling 
for fiscal years 1992-1995. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who opposes new taxes or fees, said Thursday that the city can live 
within a $432-million budget next year without laying off employees because the 
sum is nearly 5% more than the city's current $414 million budget.

SCHOOL BOUNDARY CHANGES CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to shift school boundaries in Oxnard to relieve chronic overcrowding at 
Channel Islands and Oxnard high schools was considered Wednesday by Oxnard 
Union High School District board members. 
</P>
<P>
The report by district staff members recommends shifting boundaries so that 
more students attend Hueneme and Rio Mesa high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The plan focuses on students in the fifth to eighth grades who will be high 
school students over the next four years, said Assistant Supt. Gary Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the enrollment figures projected through the 1993-4 academic year 
show that Channel Islands High, with a capacity of 2,240 and an enrollment of 
2,692, would have more than 3,000 students if there are no boundary changes. 
With the boundary changes, it would enroll 2,660, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard High, designed to hold 2,060, would hold 2,709 in 1993-4 with existing 
boundaries, 2,511 if the changes are put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The projections were based on 5,750 houses being built and .216 students per 
house, statistics derived from studies of previous years, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the district would like to enroll about 2,250 students per high 
school and seek alternative methods of dealing with overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members suggested that the recommendations were premature. A public 
hearing on the proposal is scheduled today at a PTA meeting at Rio Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said an additional concern is that two new schools are planned 
for completion by the 1994-5 academic year, and some students may have to be 
moved twice. Under the plan, no student starting at one high school would be 
transferred, Davis said. DAN GOLDBERG

PANEL OKS WILMINGTON ZONING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee unanimously approved changes in the 
long-awaited Wilmington-Harbor City community plan Tuesday, paving the way for 
the plan to come before the full council sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee delayed action for 
three weeks on a proposal to limit the number of oil wells in the Wilmington 
Oil Field and on two proposed zoning changes in Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Juravich, deputy for City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, whose district 
includes Wilmington and Harbor City, said the delays should not affect the 
plan's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can have this before the full City Council in five weeks," 
Juravich said after Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal to create a Historic preservation overlay zone in the area south of 
Banning Park was not addressed Tuesday. The proposal, which has divided 
residents in the neighborhood, must go through a number of separate committees 
and public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The updated community plan, which will govern growth of the area until 2010, 
has been winding through the city bureaucracy for more than six years. The 
revision would significantly alter a 1970 plan that has allowed new factories 
and heavy industry to be built alongside residential neighborhoods in 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 Wilmington residents attending the hearing were ecstatic at the 
committee's strong support of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to call this a first for us. We are actually going to get some 
real planning happening for Wilmington," said Peter Mendoza, president of the 
Wilmington Home Owners, the largest neighborhood group in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington residents have contended for years that their community is the "poor 
stepsister" of Los Angeles, and planning officials acknowledge that Wilmington 
has the highest concentration of land zoned for industry of any community in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan approved by the committee Tuesday seeks to reduce the impact 
of industrial development by creating buffers around residential zones and by 
changing zoning in east Wilmington to allow only single-family homes in several 
mostly residential areas. The plan allows the city to set up timetables 
requiring incompatible industries to move. The plan would also encourage 
industrial development in an area farther east of the residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington residents expressed particular pride Tuesday in their successful 
efforts to persuade the Planning Commission to extend the residential-only 
zoning to several neighborhoods that were not included in previous drafts of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very hopeful about the decision to change the zoning to (residential) 
in east Wilmington. That has always been one of our goals," said Joann Wysocki, 
vice president of the Wilmington Home Owners. "Our aim is to start improving 
the area, to get people to live there and upgrade it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Councilman Hal Bernson indicated early in the hearing that the 
committee would probably approve the revisions, an attorney for Exxon persuaded 
the committee to delay discussion on the oil field for three weeks. Joan A. 
Wolff told the commission that reclassifying the Wilmington Oil Field as an 
urbanized area, as proposed in the plan, would force the company to cap several 
operating wells. In an urbanized area, fewer oil wells per acre are allowed to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon cannot simply pick up its oil wells and move them to a different 
location," Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Wolff said she could not say what the potential 
effect of the reclassification would be. 
</P>
<P>
Three other representatives of businesses that could potentially be affected by 
the proposed restrictions also spoke in opposition. The owner of an auto 
salvage yard said the plan would prevent expansion of his business, and an 
attorney for Gunn Van Lines, a moving and storage company in a residential 
neighborhood south of Pacific Coast Highway, complained that new zoning could 
force the company to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
The committee delayed action on two proposals involving height restrictions in 
the Harbor Pines area after a resident said she needed more time to find out 
how they would affect her neighborhood.

5 REPUBLICANS SEEK LA FOLLETTE'S ASSEMBLY SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lured by one of the biggest temptations in politics -- a vacant seat -- five 
Republicans have declared themselves candidates to replace retiring GOP 
Assemblywoman Marian La Follette of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette, a five-term veteran, surprised political observers with a Feb. 27 
announcement that she will not seek reelection to her 38th Assembly District 
seat, saying Assembly members should serve no more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although two Democrats also are candidates, the winner of the June 5 GOP 
primary will probably succeed La Follette because Republicans outnumber 
Democrats 87,000 to 74,500 in the northern San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP candidates who filed papers by Wednesday's deadline are Robert Wilcox, 
a La Follette aide; Paula Boland, a Granada Hills real estate broker; Robert L. 
Scott, a business lawyer from Granada Hills; Hal J. Styles, a substitute 
teacher from Woodland Hills, and Al Thomas, of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
However, political observers say the race for the GOP nomination is likely to 
boil down to Wilcox and Boland. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, 24, is closely identified with La Follette's long but unsuccessful 
drive to carve the massive Los Angeles Unified School District into smaller 
school systems. Wilcox has been endorsed by La Follette and state Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Valencia), a former employer. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, 50, is well-known in grass-roots Republican circles and has been a 
frequent volunteer in local GOP campaigns. She won political blessings from GOP 
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright of Simi Valley and Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll probably come down to those two," said Republican political consultant 
Allan Hoffenblum. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think either one is the favorite," he said. "I think they're starting 
even. . . . To be a favorite, you'd have to convince me that one has 
significant name identification over the other. I don't think that's the case." 
</P>
<P>
Given the short time before the election, and recent campaign reforms that 
reduce the ability of state officeholders to funnel money to local candidates, 
the campaign for La Follette's seat will probably turn on who can raise the 
most money quickly from small individual contributors, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"It boils down to who raises sufficient money to put on an effective mail 
campaign," said GOP consultant Paul Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing her retirement, La Follette, 63, pledged to serve out the 
remainder of her term, which expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Two Democrats also have filed for La Follette's seat. They are Irene Allert, a 
Kagel Canyon educator and businesswoman, and Gary Crandall, a Northridge 
computer manual writer. 
</P>
<P>
But the two Democrats -- both in their first bid for public office -- are 
little known and party strategists hold scant hope for a Democratic upset in 
November in the Republican-dominated district. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting for a Democrat to win in the 38th Assembly District is like leaving 
the porch light on for Jimmy Hoffa," lamented one Democratic consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the race are two Peace and Freedom Party candidates, Charles 
Najbergier, a registered nurse, and Leah Parker, a bookkeeper.

4 OF 5 FARMS DROP OUT OF L.A. SLUDGE-DUMPING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A plan by the city of Los Angeles to get rid of up to 300 tons a day of sewage 
sludge by spreading it over Antelope Valley farm fields as fertilizer appeared 
to be unraveling Wednesday, as the owners of four of the five proposed farm 
sites backed out. 
</P>
<P>
The farmers, who control about 2,900 of the 3,500 acres involved, said in 
interviews that they don't want land sales or development prospects endangered 
by sludge-related environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
That left only one 640-acre farm, which is owned by the company that the city 
hired to truck the sludge. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded pretty good at the time to get free fertilizer on your land," said 
William Barnes, owner of the 941-acre Barnes Bros. Ranch west of Lancaster. 
"But I'm not so hot on that thinking now. We're too close to development to 
jeopardize it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the Antelope 
Valley area, said he planned to ask the Board of Supervisors today to halt the 
project pending county review. 
</P>
<P>
That came on the heels of high desert environmentalists vowing to fight the 
plan, and officials in the valley's two largest cities -- Lancaster and 
Palmdale -- complaining that they knew nothing of the proposed sludge dumping 
in outlying areas until it was reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, through a private company, Bio Gro Systems Inc., had 
applied for a state permit to dispose of more than 20% of the city's treated 
sewage sludge in the Antelope Valley. A state water board, citing fears of 
ground-water pollution, last week delayed its decision for two months. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles produces about 1,350 tons of sewage sludge daily. About 950 tons 
each day is trucked to farms in Riverside County and Yuma, Ariz. The city wants 
to cut its trucking costs by shifting about a third of that to the high desert. 
The rest is used at the BKK landfill in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, Bio Gro began offering Antelope Valley farmers free 
sewage sludge for use as fertilizer. Bio Gro bought its own 640-acre site west 
of Lancaster, and four other area farm owners signed up, making five sites. 
</P>
<P>
But Barnes and representatives of the Ritter and Goode Ranch and the Munz Ranch 
say that they are no longer interested in the sludge, because drought and 
rising land prices have made it more profitable to sell the land for housing. 
</P>
<P>
The development company that owns the fourth site, the 480-acre Kotchian and 
Maricich Ranch east of Palmdale, also has turned Bio Gro down, said Ken 
Hatcher, who farms the land. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Bio Gro said the company still intends to pursue the project 
and will try to recruit other area farmers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Carol Pavon, Bio Gro's monitoring manager in Palmdale, said she did 
not know whether the company had been told by the four landowners of their 
change of heart. "We still have our ranch, and we'll have to go and talk to the 
farmers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Barnes, Arnold Munz, owner of Munz Ranch, said he too is looking to get 
out of farming. "I'm not going to do it," he said of the sludge. "I want to 
sell the ground. And I'll never be able to do it if I tie up the land." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ritter and Goode Ranch said it has a buyer under option who 
wants nothing to do with Los Angeles sewage sludge.

The head of the water district that serves Oxnard and Port Hueneme, which has 
nitrate contamination in two of its 17 wells, said Wednesday that he has asked 
the Metropolitan Water District to help assure a safe supply to customers in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Fred J. Gientke of the United Water Conservation District, said 
he expects no shortage of safe water. 
</P>
<P>
The district's operations superintendent, Bernard McBride, said after a 
district board meeting Wednesday, "I don't foresee anything on the horizon that 
will stop us from delivering the water we are contracted to." 
</P>
<P>
The concentration of nitrate in the two contaminated wells does not pose a 
serious health hazard to adults but is harmful to young children. JOEL BRAND

LAKEWOOD SEEKS COALITION OF CITIES IN WATER BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lakewood officials have decided to launch an ambitious effort to give Southeast 
cities more clout with federal, state and local agencies that have authority 
over the area's water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to organize a coalition of up to 20 
cities stretching from the Whittier Hills to Long Beach, including Downey, 
Bellflower, South Gate, Compton, Paramount, Montebello, Norwalk and Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition is the centerpiece of the city's "water resource management 
strategic plan," designed to preserve the quality and supply of its water, 95% 
of which comes from wells. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition -- an idea Lakewood must sell to its neighbors in the Los Angeles 
County Central Basin -- would represent the cities' interests before the myriad 
of public agencies that make decisions about water, such as the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, and 
the Central and West Basin Water Replenishment District. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that relates directly to the quality of life in Southern 
California," said James L. Easton, the consultant Lakewood hired last year to 
help draw up a plan for safeguarding the city's water. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood officials already have informally approached a few neighboring cities, 
and the response has been positive, said James B. Glancy, the city's director 
of water resources. Now that the council has adopted the strategic plan, Glancy 
added, the city can formally begin an organizing effort. 
</P>
<P>
In South Gate, the director of public works and engineering, Rollie D. Berry, 
said that Lakewood's call for a coalition is an excellent idea. "There's really 
no coalition among (the cities) to make their wants and needs heard through a 
common voice," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate had to close six of its 14 wells because of contamination from 
industrial solvents and recently issued $14.7 million worth of bonds to pay for 
their cleanup, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood and other cities want to maintain an adequate supply of good water for 
their residents, Easton said, but they cannot do that if the supply is 
threatened by events that happen along a river bank in Northern California or 
in a factory in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
"Aquifers don't know city boundaries," said Councilman Marc Titel, referring to 
the underground storage areas that move water and toxins miles from their 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
It has been determined by state and federal agencies, for example, that ground 
water underneath the Central Basin cities is threatened by toxins that were 
left in the ground decades ago by industries in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest toxic plumes, Easton said in an interview before the City 
Council meeting, has collected in the Whittier Narrows at the intersection of 
the 605 and 210 freeways, and it will slowly move southward. 
</P>
<P>
"This plume is pointing just like a gun at the Central Basin," said Easton, who 
is vice president of Willdan Associates, a statewide engineering and planning 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
The site has been designated for cleanup by the federal government, but that 
will cost from $600 million to $800 million, Easton said. The federal 
government says it does not have money to pay for the cleanup, but a regional 
coalition of cities, he suggested, could begin lobbying federal and state 
lawmakers to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood's strategic water plan also calls for lobbying the state and federal 
governments to hire more staff in agencies that are responsible for identifying 
polluters and prosecuting them.

TORRANCE SCHOOLS CUT BUDGET, KEEP BUS SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance school board members eliminated $1.5 million from next year's budget 
Tuesday night through a series of staff cuts and service reductions, but they 
backed off a proposal to end bus service after receiving a flood of telephone 
calls and letters in the past week from residents protesting the move. 
</P>
<P>
The board had planned last week to cut nearly $2.9 million from the budget, 
including all daily bus service and more than 40 staff positions, in 
preparation for pending reductions in their $79-million budget based on Gov. 
George Deukmejian's initial state budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But instead they cut $1.5 million Tuesday night and reserved the right to cut 
more after the Legislature approves the state budget. They called the $2.9 
million in cuts a worst-case scenario that the district would probably not 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts included the elimination of 20 positions, some through attrition and 
others through dismissals. Funding for staff development for teachers was cut 
in half, and a restructuring of the reading and limited English proficiency 
programs eliminated seven, or about one-fourth, of the teaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to keep the cuts as far from the classroom as possible," Supt. Edward 
Richardson said in a statement released Wednesday, "but with each succeeding 
round of cuts this became more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
In a process that board member Ann Gallagher likened to shopping, the board 
pored over Richardson's list of 29 proposed reductions and added or deleted 
them from the list piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a real tough evening," Gallagher said. "It's been a real tough 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives offered tempered criticism of the cuts during the 
meeting, but board members staved off most community opposition by agreeing to 
maintain bus service, and by keeping four high school English positions and 
instructional aides for elementary and middle school classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Franchini, director of the Torrance Teachers Assn., praised board members. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in a very negative situation, they acted very positively," he said. "I 
think they made cuts as far away from the classroom as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Board members called all the cuts preliminary and said their work is not done 
until final budget numbers come in this summer from Sacramento. They urged 
residents to lobby legislators for increased funding for education. 
</P>
<P>
"While the entire country is calling for upgrading of public schools, 
California is going backward financially," Richardson said in the statement. 
"In the end, you get what you pay for, and the children in California are the 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
Other cuts approved by the board: a moratorium on all conference attendance 
this fiscal year and a 50% cut in the conference budget for next year, a 50% 
cut in elementary school study trips and an unspecified increase in charges for 
adult education courses. 
</P>
<P>
An additional $375,000 was saved by agreeing to add teachers to schools in 
accordance with already-established teacher to staff ratios. Currently, the 
district sometimes adds additional teachers to schools in the spring when the 
class size is under board-established limits but growth is expected the next 
fall. District officials said strictly enforcing the board limits would 
increase class size slightly and increase combination classes in some schools, 
but they provided no estimates of the extent of the impact. 
</P>
<P>
The board saved an additional $860,000 by cutting the following positions: 
seven remedial reading instructors, four custodians, four maintenance workers, 
one independent studies teacher, one computer programmer, 1 1/2 clerical 
workers, one child welfare and attendance office administrator, and at least 
one staff development teacher. The board also saved $88,000 by freezing eight 
unfilled positions until the end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Board members also agreed to reduce the number of substitute teachers needed to 
monitor a state-mandated writing test by requiring that students complete one 
essay instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
The board also saved $45,000 by reducing health insurance costs, although it 
did not specify a change in the district insurance plan.

Declaring that "California needs a diaper change," Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San 
Diego) on Wednesday unveiled a bill that would require environmental warning 
stickers on packages of plastic disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation, Senate Bill 2342, would set up a toll-free "diaper 
line" to advise parents on ecologically safe alternatives to disposable 
diapers. 
</P>
<P>
It would also prohibit child care centers from discriminating against children 
whose parents opt for reusable cloth diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Killea said she was introducing the bill because 2.5 million disposable diapers 
were sent to dwindling landfills or thrown away as litter -- an output that 
costs the state $56 million in disposal costs. 
</P>
<P>
If parents were to switch to old-fashioned cloth diapers, or even those with 
new Velcro fasteners, the savings over disposable diapers would be $1,500 per 
child, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken on aluminum, glass and plastic beverage containers," Killea said. 
"We're recycling newspaper. We're moving forward on recycling oil and tires. 
But no one wants to touch diapers." 
</P>
<P>
Killea also said her staff called 266 child care centers and found that 26% 
refused to take children whose parents prefer cloth diapers. RALPH FRAMMOLINO

200 PROTEST PROPOSED COUNTY DUMP NEAR PALA; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC MEETING: CITIZENS VOICE CONCERNS OVER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND 
METHOD OF 
</P>

<P>
William Worrell of the county's solid waste division sat quietly as he was 
berated by silver-haired Jeanne Ray on the evils of a proposed landfill site 
near Pala. 
</P>
<P>
Ray was one of more than 200 people who packed the Pauma Valley Community 
Center to protest the development of the site. They sat in folding chairs, 
lined the walls, stood in front of doorways and outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd at the meeting hall was just one indication to Ray that the county 
was not taking the matter seriously. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second of three public meetings held by the Department of Public 
Works to discuss future North County landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who attended the meeting voiced concerns over everything from the 
process by which the Gregory Canyon site was chosen to the depth of the 
environmental impact report to what they perceived as strong-armed politicking, 
not to mention the adverse effect expected from putting a 33-million-cubic-yard 
dump in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"There are issues that can't be mitigated," said Worrell, deputy directory of 
the solid waste division. "And those issues have to be considered by the 
Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors when they make their 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
The Gregory Canyon site, 2 1/2 miles from Pala, is one of three proposed by the 
county to replace the nearly full San Marcos landfill, which is expected to 
reach capacity in five to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The county's proposed action is to purchase and operate all three sites as 
landfills. One of the other sites is near Fallbrook and the other near Warner 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the three sites are projected to provide landfill space for North 
County for the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, about 1,000 residents of the Fallbrook area demonstrated their 
opposition to a proposal to put a landfill on Aspen Road, voicing concerns over 
noise and air pollution, the traffic from an expected 465 daily dump truck 
trips, and threats to the county's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's meeting, residents near the proposed Gregory Canyon site 
expressed similar concerns, including fear that the nearby Pala Indian 
Reservation would be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concerns are water quality, the Indians' rights, and traffic," said 
Virginia Buonarati, vice president of the North County Coalition, a 
neighborhood group formed specifically to fight the landfill proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the cities have to take some responsibility for their trash," 
Buonarati said, pointing out that large North County communities such as 
Oceanside, Escondido and Vista produce most of the waste that will go into the 
landfill. "Why should we take all the trash from the cities? I think they 
should look at the cities for trash sites." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Gregory Canyon site is just south of the San Luis Rey River, and 
Buonarati said it will threaten the county's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the county has done a very poor job in their site selection. For the 
county to take a chance on endangering a large percentage of the water supply 
is outrageous," Buonarati said. "Trash seems to be more important to the county 
than drinking water." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed landfill also would be next to Gregory Mountain, a sacred mountain 
to the Pala Indians, said Ruth Harber of the North County Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"The wall of the mountain will be part of the wall of the dump," Harber said. 
"That sacred mountain is just like our Vatican or our churches. You don't put a 
dump next to a religious monument." 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report on the landfill sites conceded that 
development of the landfill "would result in significant odor impacts to the 
limited population" and that those impacts are "unmitigable." 
</P>
<P>
Impact to the Pala Indians' sacred mountain, Medicine Rock, also "could not be 
mitigated below a level of significance," said the draft EIR, which was issued 
in January by the Butler Roach Group, the county's environmental consultants.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County began sending out a new pamphlet this week to mental health 
clients and service providers, marking the final settlement of a lawsuit over 
cuts in the mental health budget in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet lists what services the county will provide and includes detailed 
grievance procedures clients can use if they feel they have been unfairly 
denied services. 
</P>
<P>
The grievance procedure was developed to settle the Legal Aid Society of San 
Diego's contention that clients were denied due process when $3.2 million was 
cut from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit's other key contention, that the county was required to give a 
minimum level of service to the mentally ill, became moot in February, 1989. 
Superior Court Judge Robert E. May notified the parties then that an appellate 
court decision in a similar Los Angeles suit would require him to reject that 
argument. Since then, attorneys have been negotiating over the due-process 
issue.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MALL CONSTRUCTION RULES TIGHTENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what one councilman called an effort to keep swap-meet-style malls out of 
Gardena, the City Council Tuesday night tightened building specifications for 
leased spaces in covered malls. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved an ordinance requiring a 600-square-foot 
minimum for 90% of the leased spaces in covered malls. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also revises standards for food uses, parking and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The action is part of a yearlong effort by city officials to evaluate and 
revise laws for mall development. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Rikuo Corp. submitted plans to develop a 67,500-square-foot mall 
at 13999 S. Western Ave. The proposal was approved by the Planning Commission, 
but the council stopped construction after reviewing how much space the 
developer planned to give individual businesses.

ABORTION CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willke has taken yet another tactic in his rhetorical attack on abortion. This 
time he hopes to appeal to modern America's repulsion toward slavery. 
</P>
<P>
I only wish the pro-lifers would consider the fact that life does not end at 
birth. It is becoming increasingly clear that the unborn has become their God 
and object of worship beyond reason. They use terms like "killing" and "murder" 
when describing the medical procedure. Imagine someone protesting in front of a 
McDonald's over the "murder" of the animals that make up the menu. Since The 
Times gave space to such abuse of the language, let me give you a few other 
definitions of murder: 
</P>
<P>
"Murder" is a baby being shot by an AK-47 in a drive-by shooting because the 
self-esteem of modern youth has been shattered by hard-headed and unreasonable 
government policies instituted in the name of "morality." 
</P>
<P>
"Murder" is the countless bodies of animals washed ashore covered with oil 
because we try to keep up with the demand of an already overpopulated, yet 
spoiled culture that demands only the finest things in life without regard for 
future generations.

"Murder" is the death of spirituality when people in our overpopulated world

Thrusting life upon the unwanted seems like cruel and unusual punishment; but

DEFENSE JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times describes politicians using jobs to justify their scramble to appease 
defense contractors ("Congress Feels Pressure to Save Defense Jobs," Part A, 
March 2). However, the coverage fails to point out the lack of logic behind 
these seemingly pork-barrel ploys. 
</P>
<P>
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and others shows that defense projects 
are less labor intensive than other investments. For example, $1 billion spent 
to create 28,000 defense jobs could instead generate 32,000 transportation 
jobs, 57,000 consumer jobs or 71,000 education jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians should scramble instead to support retraining programs and economic 
conversion projects such as the ones currently before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
H.R. 101, the Defense Economic Adjustment Act, addresses the needs of companies 
during economic conversion, and H.R. 2852, the Economic Diversification and 
Defense Adjustment Act, has complementary aims to assist communities with their 
plans for a more productive future.

NORTHROP CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Reeves claims he was trained as a mechanical engineer and respect for 
numbers is his "professional religion." He might have written a better column 
about Northrop if he had been well-trained as a reporter, with a respect for 
facts (Op-Ed Page, March 2). 
</P>
<P>
He might have avoided smearing "a lot of engineers" at Northrop and elsewhere 
if he had reported that the failure to perform certain tests was the failure of 
three or four people, as the record shows; that when Northrop discovered what 
they had done, they were fired; that Northrop promptly disclosed the problem to 
the public and reported in great detail to the military services using the 
equipment; that Northrop offered to redo the tests and repay the government for 
the cost of the tests what weren't performed. Reeves might also have been less 
alarmed and alarming if he had reported that both armed services have found the 
equipment is operating satisfactorily. 
</P>
<P>
The company pleaded guilty because under the law it accepted responsibility for 
the unauthorized and unacceptable acts of three or four of its employees -- 
even though they had acted on their own, and even though it had fired them 
nearly three years before when their behavior was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
If Reeves had a respect for facts as well as numbers he might also have 
reported that the government's decision, once it had achieved agreement on a 
guilty plea, to call a halt finally to a number of criminal investigations it 
had dragged on for years was endorsed by a federal court. If Reeves had a 
respect for words, he could not have falsified information to proclaim, as he 
did without substantiation, that the company overcharged the government on the 
Stealth bomber. Had he not been so mechanically engineering in his diatribe, he 
might have considered the possibility that it was precisely this lack of 
substantiation for these and other issues that led the government to stop its 
investigations, and led the federal court to agree. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 men and women work at Northrop around the country. They work 
hard, and responsibly and with justifiable pride in their achievements in 
delivering quality products to our military services. They have every right to 
be outraged at what the acts of a few individuals might have caused, and what 
those acts did cause for their company and their reputations. And they have an 
equal right to be outraged at Reeves' willingness to throw away the facts in 
favor of a few false phrases, and, indeed, at The Times' willingness to print 
them.

EASING COMMUTER NIGHTMARES; 
</P>
<P>
ATTENTION L.A.: ORANGE COUNTY HAS A BETTER IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The railroad opened the West to settlers and now it can help open it up again 
for commuters. No one way to travel can supply all the answers to relieve a 
region's traffic congestion. However, in the mix of high-occupancy vehicle 
lanes, buses and vans, the iron horse belongs on any list for easing Southern 
California's mass transportation problems. 
</P>
<P>
Each transportation decision made or not made affects the overall picture. 
That's why it's heartening to see Orange County doing something to encourage 
commuters to ride the rails and discouraging to see Los Angeles County stalling 
on an opportunity to lay groundwork for its own rail system. Orange County's 
choice shows foresight. Los Angeles County's does not. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission had been pushing for more than a 
year to get a commuter train to ease congestion caused by the widening of the 
Santa Ana Freeway. With hopes for future growth, county officials negotiated 
with Amtrak for Southern California's first passenger- train service created 
solely for commuters -- and tailored entirely to their schedules. Made possible 
by a $1.8-million annual subsidy from the county, the train is scheduled to 
begin runs in April between San Juan Capistrano and Union Station in Los 
Angeles. There will be three stops: Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fullerton, with 
future ones planned for Irvine and the City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: Getting people out of automobiles is a formidable task, even 
with such foresight and planning. The mystical bond between commuters and cars 
can be broken only with compelling incentives to change habits. The planned 
fare subsidy of 20% for the new service is a plus. Still, for the idea to catch 
on and grow, count on commuters to expect trains that are punctual and clean, 
and stations that afford convenient parking. There already are concerns about 
parking spaces at San Juan Capistrano that must be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
As Orange County moves forward, opportunity to acquire some railroad rights of 
way slides by in Los Angeles County. Southern Pacific and Santa Fe have five 
little-used branch lines and some adjacent properties that could be in the 
county's hands with some bargaining. All could be linked with Metro Rail or 
light-rail lines and help the county recover a fixed-rail transit system. 
</P>
<P>
Acquiring rail lines and running commuter trains are specific choices that can 
help take cars off jammed freeways. To make sense, a regional transportation 
system has to have elements that work together. But that won't just happen. It 
takes planning and political will.

A GOOD ENOUGH GENIUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the pantheon of our century's genuine heroes, there surely will be a place 
for psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, the sage of childhood, who died this week 
at the age of 86. The fact that a healer who restored so many wounded children 
to hope took his own life after suffering a debilitating stroke doubtless will 
disturb some people. But such an act also can be seen as an affirmation of that 
courageous but austere autonomy Bettelheim learned to prize as a committed, 
though undogmatic, pupil of his great teacher Sigmund Freud. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vienna, Bettelheim studied with Freud and became a pioneer in the 
treatment of children's emotional disturbances. In 1938, Bettelheim, a Jew, was 
arrested by the Nazis and spent nearly two years in Buchenwald and Dachau. 
Freed, partly through the intervention of Eleanor Roosevelt, he came to the 
United States, where he directed the University of Chicago's treatment center 
for disturbed children. His work there as a therapist formed the basis for many 
of his books, including the influential "Love Is Not Enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bettelheim's approach to the children he treated represented a conscious 
attempt to reverse the diabolical assault on prisoners' personalities he had 
witnessed in the Nazi camps. "He told me that once you were in a camp, you 
could never escape the cruelty," said Rudolph Ekstein, a Los Angeles 
psychoanalyst. "He turned it upside down when he started his school for 
disturbed children. It was a protected, caring environment, the mirror opposite 
of the camps. The door was locked to the outside, but always open from the 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps best known for "The Uses of Enchantment," his investigation of fairy 
tales' powerful emotional hold on children, Bettelheim also was a wide-ranging 
cultural critic and scholar of psychoanalysis, being particularly concerned 
with recovering the spiritual and ethical nuances he felt had been lost during 
the translation of Freud's work into English. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Bettelheim published what he called "my testament," a book he titled 
"A Good Enough Parent." In it he argued that while children are "innately 
good," none can be made "perfect," and that any conscientious parent is "good 
enough." It was a humane, consoling and guilt-dissolving conclusion to what his 
longtime editor Robert Gottlieb fittingly described as a "beautiful and useful 
life."

DRUGS INTOXICANTS EVERYWHERE; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A DRIVE AS NATURAL AS FOOD OR SEX; 
</P>
<P>
IN A SENSE, THE WAR AGAINST MIND-ALTERING SUBSTANCES IS A WAR AGAINST 
OURSELVES, A DENIAL OF OUR VERY BIOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD K. SIEGEL, Ronald K. Siegel is a psychopharmacologist at the UCLA 
School of Medicine. His 1989 book, Intoxication: Life in Pursuit of Artificial 
Paradise (Dutton), will be published in paperback later this year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a silent spring of intoxicants that flows through our lives and 
bodies. Whether we wake up with a cup of coffee or a line of cocaine; whether 
we take a break with a cigarette or a beer; whether we relax after work with a 
cocktail or a joint of marijuana; whether we go to sleep with something we 
bought at the pharmacy or on the street -- we use drugs to change the way we 
feel. Nobody wants this to be unhealthy or dangerous. Nobody wants people 
living out their lives inside crack houses, dying from cancer caused by tobacco 
or lying dead on the highways as a result of drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
At the drug summit in Cartagena last month, President Bush announced a "new" 
emphasis on reducing consumption, although his speech echoed the words of 
former President Richard Nixon when he declared his war on drugs in 1971. Sure, 
we can discourage the use of a drug such as cocaine. Already, the image of 
cocaine has been transformed from a glamorous drug for the rich and famous to 
one found in dirty crack pipes on inner-city streets. This new image has turned 
off many users but the lower price of "crack" has attracted many more. 
</P>
<P>
So we blockade their streets and bulldoze their crack houses. When we uncover 
huge warehouses full of cocaine, we find out who sent it. Then we go after 
them, encouraging extradition, kidnaping if we must, even invading a country to 
capture just one of the kingpins. The federal budget escalates as we provide 
military support for coca eradication in the jungles of South America and 
coerce foreign governments reluctant to help. At home, we use urine tests to 
uproot users from their jobs and write tough laws to treat dealers like so many 
coca shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
If the domestic cultivation of coca now beginning in several states -- Florida, 
Hawaii, Arizona, California -- is curtailed, and the development of 
synthetic-coke labs can be avoided, these efforts might reduce cocaine use. 
Let's say they do. 
</P>
<P>
What if cocaine simply disappeared from the face of the Earth? The war on drugs 
would still be lost. Why? Because the drive to use drugs is unstoppable and the 
supplies are unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
History shows that we have always used drugs. In every age, in every part of 
this planet, people have pursued intoxication by consuming drugs derived from 
plants, alcohol and other mind-altering substances. Surprisingly, we're not the 
only ones to do this. Almost every species of animal has engaged in the natural 
pursuit of intoxicants. This behavior has so much force and persistence that it 
functions like a drive, just like our drives of hunger, thirst and sex. This 
"fourth drive" is a natural part of our biology, creating the irrepressible 
demand for drugs. In a sense, the war on drugs is a war against ourselves, a 
denial of our very nature. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this "fourth drive" sometimes runs amok and overshadows the other 
drives, as is the case when animals and people pursue an intoxicant to the 
exclusion of everything else in their lives. This tells us that we are doing 
the right thing when we try to curtail cocaine use. But there is simply no end 
to the supply of dangerous drugs. Already, there is a methamphetamine ("ice") 
epidemic looming on the horizon, ready to recruit ex-cocaine users to its 
ranks. Designer chemistry, exotic plants, even over-the-counter medicines 
provide endless sources of new highs. And so the war on drugs will continue, as 
it has throughout history. 
</P>
<P>
Some people want to stop the war, putting an end to its enormous societal 
costs, by legalizing drugs such as cocaine or heroin. The voices calling for 
legalization are not only well-intentioned, they are also louder and more 
respectable than ever. But calling a drug legal doesn't change its basic 
pharmacology or safety any more than saying "no" changes our basic drive to 
pursue intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
Making some dangerous drugs illegal while keeping others legal is not the 
solution. Outlawing drugs to solve drug problems is much like outlawing sex to 
win the war against AIDS. We recognize that people will continue to have sex 
for non-reproductive reasons, whatever the laws or mores. Thus, we try to make 
sexual practices as safe as possible in order to minimize the spread of the 
AIDS viruses. Similarly, we continually try to make our drinking water, foods 
and pharmaceutical medicines safer. 
</P>
<P>
To solve the drug problem, we must recognize that intoxicants are medicines, 
treatments for the human condition. Then we must make them as safe and 
risk-free and -- yes -- as healthy as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Dream with me for a moment. What would be wrong if we had perfectly safe drugs? 
I mean drugs that delivered the same effects as our most popular ones but never 
caused dependency, disease, dysfunction or death. Imagine an alcohol-type drug 
that never caused addiction, liver disease, hangovers, reckless driving or 
workplace problems. Would you care for a cigarette that is as enjoyable as 
marijuana but as harmless as clean air? 
</P>
<P>
This is not science fiction. There are such intoxicants available now. If drug 
czar William J. Bennett can switch from smoking tobacco to chewing nicotine 
gum, why can't crack users chew a cocaine gum that has already been tested on 
animals and found to be relatively safe? 
</P>
<P>
Even safer drugs may be just around the corner. They could be made available 
early in the next century. What would it cost to develop them? Probably less 
than this year's budget for the war on drugs. But it will first take a national 
commitment equal to putting a man on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
We must begin by recognizing that there is a legitimate place in our society 
for intoxication. Then we can join in building new, perfectly safe intoxicants 
for a world that will be ready to discard the old ones as the corroding pieces 
of junk they really are.

ATTORNEY CLAIMS CLIENT MAY HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT BROTHER IN GUARD'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man on trial for machine-gunning an armored car guard, leaving him 
paralyzed, may have gotten involved in the aftermath of the crime only because 
he tried to protect his older brother, the true gunman, the younger brother's 
defense attorney argued Wednesday in Pasadena Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments in the second trial of Alfred Giordano, attorney Robert C. 
Swanson portrayed his client as a possible accessory in the shooting of Howard 
White, an armored car guard. White was machine-gunned by a would-be robber on 
Dec. 31, 1987, outside a check-cashing service in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson told jurors that it was Peter Giordano, Alfred's older brother, who 
wounded White. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have linked Alfred to attempts to disguise the getaway car and to 
hide the Uzi submachine gun involved in the shooting. The defense attorney said 
Alfred may have gotten involved following the shooting to protect Peter. 
</P>
<P>
"You could believe that Al, knowing Peter committed a crime, could have helped 
Peter in covering it up," Swanson told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Ann B. Glidden argued that Peter Giordano was the 
getaway driver in the crime, and that Alfred Giordano was the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfred Giordano did everything in his power to kill Howard White," Glidden 
told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Both Alfred, 27, and Peter, 33, were charged with attempted murder and 
attempted robbery. But in a trial last May, Peter was acquitted of his alleged 
role and a mistrial was declared on the charges against Alfred after jurors 
deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson tried earlier this week to call Peter Giordano to the witness stand, 
and asked Judge Terry Smerling to grant him immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
But in a hearing Monday outside the presence of the jury, Smerling ruled that 
Peter would not be allowed to testify. Smerling said the prosecutor would be 
unfairly restricted in cross-examination because Peter, although acquitted 
earlier, indicated he would refuse to answer questions that could implicate him 
in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Since the second trial began on Feb. 15, Glidden has presented witnesses who 
testified they saw Alfred Giordano shoot White, search the canvas bag the guard 
was carrying, then flee after finding it empty. 
</P>
<P>
A key prosecution witness was Kimberly Giordano, Alfred's wife, who testified 
that Alfred told her he committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
But Swanson on Wednesday told jurors that Alfred Giordano was visiting a friend 
in Orange County at the time of the shooting. He said that Kimberly was jealous 
and angry at Alfred because he had been having an affair, and portrayed her 
testimony as "confused" and "willfully false." He also accused police 
investigators of coercing her to testify. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also argued that witnesses to the crime had mistaken Peter for 
Alfred. Even the victim, when asked at the first trial to point out his 
assailant, had pointed to Peter, Swanson said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PORTER RANCH PROJECT SENT BACK TO BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council quietly voted Wednesday to send a key segment of 
the Porter Ranch project back to Mayor Tom Bradley, a move that could ease the 
way for final council approval of the 1,300-acre housing and commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The council sent to Bradley proposed amendments to the Chatsworth-Porter Ranch 
District Plan, designed to accommodate the $2-billion Porter Ranch project. 
</P>
<P>
The project is a development proposed by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, 
a major Bradley campaign contributor, and Shapell's partners, Norman and Irving 
Feintech. 
</P>
<P>
Located on a Chatsworth mountain slope north of the Simi Valley Freeway, the 
project would be one of the largest single developments in the history of Los 
Angeles, with 3,395 residential units and a 6-million-square-foot commercial 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Bradley vetoed the proposed district plan amendments, claiming 
the project needed more lower-cost housing and public transit. 
</P>
<P>
The veto brought on a flurry of negotiations between the mayor and the 
project's major legislative supporter, Councilman Hal Bernson. A 
Bradley-Bernson compromise package emerged a week later. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley's veto -- which remains in effect -- created a potential tactical 
obstacle for the project's supporters, city officials said. To get final 
council approval, the supporters would need 10 votes to override the veto. 
</P>
<P>
General plan amendments, unlike most other legislative items at City Hall, 
first go to the mayor and then to the council. 
</P>
<P>
By sending the district plan amendments back to Bradley and getting his 
approval of them, the amendments bypassed the veto and can be enacted with only 
eight council votes, said Frank Fielding, a senior city planner.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRIVATE SCHOOL LOSES RIGHT TO CLOSE STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sepulveda private school lost its 15-month-old license to barricade a public 
street after Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs accused the school of using 
the threat of drug trafficking as a ruse to gain parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
By a 10-O vote, the council revoked a temporary permit given the Montclair 
College Preparatory School in December, 1988, to close off 110 feet of Langdon 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
When the council granted Montclair the right to erect a chain-link fence across 
the street in 1988, the street was a "drug depot," Montclair Headmaster Vernon 
Simpson said. After it was barricaded, drug dealers moved elsewhere, he said, 
pleading for authority to continue the closure. 
</P>
<P>
But Wachs claimed that the anti-drug argument "in this case is a ruse. They 
want to expand the school and to get additional land for parking" from the city 
by securing council permission to permanently close the street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The school last year won permission from city zoning officials to expand its 
campus to accommodate six new classrooms and increase its enrollment to 400 
students from the 250 allowed under a city zoning permit issued 15 years ago.

Wachs, who originally backed the temporary street-closing permit, said he 
wanted that permit revoked because closure is opposed by "everybody" in the 
neighborhood but the school. The closure has inconvenienced the residents of a 
37-unit townhouse project next to the school, several nearby industrial 
establishments and a day-care center, Wachs said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CHARGED IN DEATH OF FELLOW TRANSIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 37-year-old man has been charged with the murder of a fellow transient during 
an argument in an abandoned RTD bus garage in Van Nuys that had been turned 
into a homeless encampment, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Edward McCray was charged Tuesday with one count of murder and was being 
held without bail at the Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Police said McCray stabbed a 33-year-old man to death Saturday night in the 
unused garage at 14557 Sherman Way. The attack occurred during an argument, but 
police don't know what it was about, Detective Jim Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's name was not released because investigators have been unable to 
locate his family to notify them. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said several other transients who made their home in the garage 
witnessed the slaying. McCray, known as "Casper" on the street, was arrested 
Sunday morning when someone tipped police that he was eating at a restaurant 
near the garage. 
</P>
<P>
Several transients had apparently been living in the cavernous garage for 
months, Vojtecky said. He said bus bays and offices had been partitioned into 
living areas that included mattresses, cooking utensils and other belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said demolition of the garage, which is surrounded by a chain-link 
fence, began Monday.

WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S A ROBBERY SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Monica man who allegedly robbed two banks was arrested after an 
off-duty Burbank police officer spotted him acting suspiciously and provided 
the FBI with his car's license plate number, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Shaddix, 24, was arrested by FBI agents Tuesday night at his home on 
suspicion of robbing banks in Sun Valley and Burbank earlier in the day, 
Burbank Police Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Rick Burroughs was off-duty and driving in the 8800 block of Sunland 
Boulevard in Sun Valley about 3 p.m. when he saw a man with a briefcase running 
on the street, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
While watching the man, Burroughs saw red smoke puff from the briefcase. The 
officer suspected the smoke had come from the explosion of a red dye packet, a 
device routinely hidden in "bait money" turned over by tellers during bank 
robberies. The device often dyes the robber a distinctive color to help police 
find him. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs followed the man until he got in a car and drove away. The officer 
then went to a nearby Security Pacific bank and learned that it had just been 
robbed. He gave a description of the suspect, his car and its license plate 
number to FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
A short while later, a Security Pacific bank in the 3400 block of Magnolia 
Boulevard in Burbank was robbed by a man of the same description, Goldberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FBI traced the information provided by Burroughs to Shaddix, and 
he was arrested by agents who were waiting when he returned home. A gun and 
some of the money taken from the banks was found in the car, Goldberg said. The 
amount taken in the robberies was not disclosed.

IN TOURISM PUSH, STATE SEEKS ITS OWN; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: NEARLY A THIRD OF NEXT FISCAL YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET OF $7.3 MILLION 
HAS BEEN EARMARKED TO TRY TO GET CALIFORNIANS TO VACATION IN THE STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's top tourism official said Wednesday that her office hopes to use a 
35% increase in next year's promotion budget to get Californians to see more of 
the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
State Office of Tourism Director Flo Snyder, speaking at the seventh annual 
Governor's Convention on Tourism in Anaheim, said that nearly a third of next 
fiscal year's proposed budget of $7.3 million has been earmarked for in-state 
marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget, which has been sent by Gov. George Deukmejian to the 
Legislature for approval, would amount to an increase of $1.9 million over the 
state's $5.4-million tourism budget for the fiscal year ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The in-state marketing program would be primarily aimed at couples, 25 years or 
older with household incomes in excess of $35,000, to try to persuade them to 
vacation in California rather than someplace else, state tourism officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 29% of the proposed promotion budget would be spent to lure the state's 
residents to vacation in California. About 60% would be used to lure visitors 
from other states and the remaining 11% would be spent to attract foreign 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said the new plan would include advertisements for Orange County 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The state also intends to continue its print campaign for "The Californias," an 
advertising theme designed to encourage tourists to explore more of the state's 
diverse locales. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the increased tourism budget, Snyder said California -- which 
reaps more tourism dollars than any other state -- is not spending enough to 
attract visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The state spent 5 cents on tourism promotion for every visitor in 1988 and the 
average visitor spent $336 during his stay, according to the state Office of 
Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Other states spend four times as much to attract visitors who may, on average, 
spend less during their stay. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the budget was adequate, Snyder replied: "If we're talking about 
meeting the competition from other states and countries, no, it's not. We have 
to be prepared to meet the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Those warnings were echoed in a luncheon speech by Edward R. Book, president of 
the Travel Industry Assn., a major tourism-related trade organization, who 
warned that California could lose its premier status as a tourist destination 
unless it concentrates more on promoting itself.

COMPUTER FILE: XEROX RELEASES A PROGRAM WITH FINANCIAL SMARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Believe it or not, you can crunch numbers on a computer without spreadsheet 
software. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox has just released a new program, Business Wits, that performs complex 
financial calculations, ranging from tax planning to revenue forecasting to 
buy-lease decisions, that could take hours or days longer to program and run on 
a spreadsheet. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at professionals in business, finance and industry, Business Wits has an 
suggested introductory price of $595. Three specialized add-on applications for 
advanced finance, banking and investments and advanced statistics and sampling 
are also available at $150 each. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the features we think of as part of contemporary personal computing, 
such as graphics-oriented screens and using a mouse to control the cursor, grew 
out of Xerox-funded research in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Business Wits may represent another leap into the future because of its use of 
artificial intelligence technology and the way users can continually expand the 
capabilities of the program by combining its various pieces into new 
components. It is a form of "object-oriented programming," which is a new 
buzzword in computing these days. 
</P>
<P>
What you will notice right away, however, is that Business Wits doesn't look 
very futuristic. There is no fancy graphics screen, no clever icons to 
symbolize its functions, no pretty typefaces and no whimsical sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which in its initial version runs only on IBM and compatible 
computers using the DOS operating system, doesn't even have pull-down menus, 
and what passes for on-screen, context-sensitive help wasn't enough to keep me 
out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, what you get is a modular-constructed expert system with a very 
consistent mode of operation -- meaning that formulas, reports and graphs for 
figuring certain problems are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
You start by picking a general area of interest from a list contained in the 
"application bank." A number of applications come with the basic program, such 
as the "service" application bank that contains a group of financial routines. 
You can buy others and more are planned for future release. You can also create 
your own. 
</P>
<P>
Within each application are a number of "work sheets" dedicated to specific 
tasks. The work sheets have the formulas built in. Your task is to fill in the 
needed data and press "C" to calculate the results. An example is a pair of 
work sheets in which you can compare the merits of buying or leasing equipment 
based on the "net present value" of the money involved. 
</P>
<P>
All of the formulas used in Business Wits are fully disclosed, at your option, 
in an on-screen window, and their authorities are cited. A lengthy reference 
and bibliography in the manual further documents the methods used. In addition, 
all of the formulas have been verified by an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
At any time while you are entering data or after running a calculation, you can 
instantly display a graph of the results. The graphs are report quality and 
suitable for overhead or slide projection. A graph-publishing routine allows 
multiple charts to be sized and printed on the same page and provides other 
customization. 
</P>
<P>
The basic program includes several features that enhance its ease of use. One 
is called "hyper programs," of which there are 118. They contain groups of 
formulas to solve problems in 24 different categories from accelerated 
depreciation to linear programming to microeconomics to tax planning. 
</P>
<P>
Using a hyper program requires only that you select the one you want from the 
lists displayed and then fill in the blanks that it provides. 
</P>
<P>
Another feature is called "auto pilots," which are like macros in other 
programs. They cause a series of actions to be taken by the program, often 
pausing for the user to strike keys or enter data before proceeding to the next 
action. 
</P>
<P>
There are 33 of them in the basic program. One installs new application banks 
automatically. Another solves for an unknown input value in a formula if you 
know the output result. Still another optimizes for minimum or maximum output 
given a range of input values. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to tackle creation of your own programs, the basic building blocks 
are known as functions, which are akin to functions in a spreadsheet program. 
That is, they are single-purpose formulas. There are more of them than I cared 
to count, doing everything from accounting to calculus to compounding to 
computing probabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Business Wits complements rather than competes with spreadsheets. In fact, you 
can import data from popular spreadsheets, process it and export the result 
back. 
</P>
<P>
A spreadsheet is a good program for doing relatively simple computations on 
data. But it becomes difficult and time consuming to program a spreadsheet to 
make complex computations and even more difficult to keep track of what you've 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Business Wits, on the other hand, is meant to do very complex calculations on 
relatively small chunks of data. Each of its work sheets, for instance, can 
handle only the equivalent of 50 rows by 61 columns of spreadsheet data. You 
can string work sheets together if you need more room, however. 
</P>
<P>
The programs are self-auditing. A cross-referenced listing of variables and 
formulas can be printed to the screen, a printer or a file. 
</P>
<P>
Another virtue is that Business Wits frees you from the constraint of 
identifying your applications with an eight-character DOS file name. Instead, 
you give it a multiword descriptive name and let the program worry about which 
file it is stored in. 
</P>
<P>
Although Business Wits is designed to be fairly easy to use, it is not a 
program for dabblers. Xerox has purposely targeted a highly specialized market 
with its first collection of built-in and add-on applications. If you don't 
already routinely solve the kinds of problems that Business Wits was designed 
for, it's not likely that you'll know what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Business Wits was created by Edward Ayoub, who has a Ph.D. in nuclear physics 
and who heads his own Toronto company, WS&amp;T World Science &amp; Technology 
Corp. He previously worked on implementation of a database analyzing corporate 
financial performance while at Northern Telecom and before that adapted 
artificial intelligence techniques to robotics at IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox invested in Ayoub's company and set up its own new company, Decisus, to 
market Business Wits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS WITS 
</P>
<P>
Features: Math functions and programs for making analyses including single 
case, sensitivity, time series, cross sectional, linear programming, decision 
tree, network, goal seeking and optimizing. Accessory applications available 
for advanced financial, banking and investment, and statistics and sampling 
calculations for $150 each. 
</P>
<P>
Requirements: IBM PC or compatible with MS-DOS 3.1 or later and at least 4 
megabytes of available hard-disk storage. A full 640 kilobytes of operating 
memory needed for graphing, while the rest of program can run on a 512-kilobyte 
machine.

VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY: A SPRING WITH LITTLE ZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Compiled by Marci Slade

<P>
Usually the wildflowers are beginning their annual parade across the mountain, 
chaparral, desert and coastal areas of Southern California at this time of 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But this winter's weather has fluctuated so wildly between heat waves and cold 
snaps -- with too little rain in between -- that nature lovers aren't counting 
on a brilliant wildflower show this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, it was fabulous. Last year, it was OK, and this year, we're not 
too sure about yet," said Dennis Bryson of the Theodore Payne Foundation, a 
nonprofit nursery in Sun Valley that specializes in native California plants 
and seeds. 
</P>
<P>
"The showiest part is usually in April. This season is starting out slowly all 
over Southern California. It's spotty, although there are likely to be some 
very good areas," Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
Three acres of hillside at the foundation's nursery are planted with California 
perennials, and Bryson anticipates a good show there beginning at the end of 
March. And, at O'Melveny Park in Granada Hills, there are lupines, poppies and 
blazing stars in bloom east of the creek. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua Tree National Monument is also more sparsely flowered than usual this 
year, with more blooms on shrubs and trees than on the ground. 
</P>

Deep in the heart of Studio City is a small town in the Midwest, a smaller town 
in Vermont and a yuppie community in Pennsylvania. Studio City is the home of 
MTM Productions and The Carsey-Werner Co., and it is where such shows as 
"Roseanne," "Newhart" and "thirtysomething" are filmed. 
</P>
<P>
Other shows that are currently in production there include Valerie Harper's 
"City," Whoopi Goldberg's new "Bagdad Cafe" and another new show called "FM." 
</P>
<P>
The two companies are located on a lot off Ventura Boulevard that originally 
was occupied by the legendary Mack Sennett of the silent-movie days. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a photo dated February, 1928, that shows the studio under 
construction, and there's a sign that says, 'Studio City Business District.' 
But we have no real record of whether it was Mr. Sennett's idea or someone 
else's to call it that," said Sondra Frohlich, executive director of the Studio 
City Chamber of Commerce.

At least the community still fulfills the promise of its name.

If you haven't found a good enough reason yet to drive to Saugus at 10:30 on a 
Tuesday morning, this may be it: free elephant manure. 
</P>
<P>
Circus Vargas is coming to the Saugus Speedway on March 20-22. On Tuesday 
morning, March 20, the animal tent will be open to the public, and you're free 
to take home five pounds of manure, but you have to bring your own shovel and 
bucket. 
</P>
<P>
"They can take however much they want, to be honest about it," says Elaine 
Stieglitz, marketing director for the circus. "We have plenty of manure, 
although I've never heard of very many people actually taking any home with 
them. It would probably smell up your car pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Last year a few thousand children and their parents showed up to take a close 
look at camels, llamas, horses, elephants, monkeys, dogs, ducks and ponies. 
"Usually the draw is the animals and not the manure," Stieglitz admits. You can 
get within five feet of the animals, although the lions and tigers are in cages 
off to the side. 
</P>
<P>
You can also watch them put up the big tent from 10:30 a.m. to noon. The first 
500 kids to arrive will get free milk and cookies, courtesy of Main Street 
Dairy and Gamesa Cookies. 
</P>
<P>
Circus Vargas is based in Hollywood but tours the entire country. Tickets are 
available through Ticketmaster, the ticket booth in Canyon Center or the circus 
ticket window.

DIRECTORS NOW SELL ORCHESTRAS THEY CONDUCT; 
</P>
<P>
SYMPHONY: SAN DIEGO'S YOAV TALMI IS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE THAT HAS DIRECTORS 
ELICITING MONEY AS WELL AS MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When the New York Philharmonic launched a fund-raising radio telethon recently, 
music director Zubin Mehta was there, using his pitch-making talents to elicit 
a mighty noise from a bank of telephones poised to field incoming donations. 
</P>
<P>
When the St. Louis Symphony was courting a major contributor recently, music 
director Leonard Slatkin personally asked for a $9-million donation. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Irvine-based Pacific Symphony marches through the Orange County 
community to drum up financial and moral support in the months and years ahead, 
the job of drum major will belong to newly appointed music director Carl St. 
Clair. 
</P>
<P>
If you still think of a music director as simply a conductor who has a steady 
job, you're living in the past. In addition to musician and administrator, the 
modern American music director also is expected to be chief cheerleader at 
fund-raisers, community gatherings and society soirees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all very lofty to believe that music sells itself but it doesn't," says 
Slatkin, who has a reputation as one of the most active and sociable music 
directors. "You have to do something if you want an orchestra to grow." 
</P>
<P>
"They definitely have a role to play in this day and age in our country," said 
Wesley O. Brustad, executive director of the San Diego Symphony, adding that 
music director Yoav Talmi pitches in "primarily in fund-raising and very 
selectively." 
</P>
<P>
"We live by our contributions," Brustad said, "But I wouldn't say he's out 
glad-handing everybody in town." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very American, and something that most conductors accept as part of the 
territory," says Jenny Vogel, vice president of ICM Talent Inc., a management 
and booking agency that represents dozens of conductors. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Europeans," she adds, "don't like socializing, partying, talking 
money or talking nice to people who might give them money. It's not part of 
their background." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Talmi, who is Israeli, is a perfect example. His first American 
assignment was as an associate conductor for the Louisville Symphony from 
1968-1970, before fund raising became very sophisticated. Talmi then returned 
to Europe, where he has held positions in Holland, Germany and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I have done very little fund raising because most of the positions I've had up 
to now were in countries where the orchestras are fully subsidized by the 
government," Talmi said. "Fund raising was done just to enhance very special 
projects like touring. I have accepted the fact that the American system is 
totally different and that part of the music director's job is to help in this 
department. But I couldn't agree more that it has to be done to a degree that 
it doesn't distract from the artistic effort." 
</P>
<P>
But in the United States, orchestras depend evermore on private support: A 
proposed 2.2% increase (to $15.9 million) in the 1990 National Endowment for 
the Arts allocation to music organizations -- of which orchestras are just one 
component -- is the first increase of any kind in the last decade, according to 
Toby Halliday, director of legislative affairs at the Washington-based American 
Symphony Orchestra League. 
</P>
<P>
That means that orchestra officials must look for every tool available to dig 
out precious unearned income, and those tools definitely include the music 
director's ability to charm. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect a music director to be a figurehead, to have a personality and 
to stand out from everybody else in the community," Vogel said. "With all the 
marketing and advertising that is done, the way orchestras are sold today (is) 
very much consumer-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
A long time ago, in a musical galaxy far, far away, an orchestra's music 
director was the person who decided what music the group would play, who led 
rehearsals presumably until that music was ready for public presentation, who 
perhaps selected guest soloists and who then took the bows and bouquets after 
the concert's finale. 
</P>
<P>
He -- for it virtually always was a man -- may have ranked among the lower 
invertebrates on the evolutionary scale of social graces, but such shortcomings 
were considered par for the Old World course. 
</P>
<P>
This style may best have been personified by Hungarian-born conductor George 
Szell, who was renowned for his fiery, near-dictatorial command of the 
Cleveland Orchestra. He led the group to greatness during his 24-year tenure as 
music director, but that was a result of his Brobdingnagian musical skills, not 
from any efforts at wooing donors. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the prune-faced authoritarian music director of yore has largely been 
displaced by a smiling fellow -- yes, it's still mostly a man's world -- who is 
expected to combine the leadership of Gandhi, the likability of Mr. Rogers and 
the salesmanship of Cal Worthington. 
</P>
<P>
"I do more than probably a lot of people would do," says Slatkin, noting 
parenthetically that his big-league pitch for $9 million brought in a donation 
of $1 million, which was $500,000 more than the orchestra's development 
director expected from the donor. "I've gone to a lot of events, but never did 
I think of them as anything except as helping to build our endowment and doing 
things we need to do to help the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"During last season we opened one of the rooms in the concert hall as a place 
for patrons to meet. In a way, that's kind of elitist and goes against what I 
believe music should be. Then again, we need to cultivate those sources of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Brustad, too, cautioned against too much of a good thing: "Yes, we 
use our music director (in fund-raising efforts), but I think an executive 
director has to play more of a role in that regard. That person has to be out 
in the community working with people as well. If you dilute the music 
director's time too much with those things, you may dilute artistic product." 
</P>
<P>
Call it the Leonard Bernstein Syndrome. But since Berstein etched the archetype 
in the '50s and '60s through regular television appearances with the New York 
Philharmonic Young People's Concerts, America has expected their orchestra 
leaders to be similarly personable, articulate and charming. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about it, that's why Bernstein has been so successfully 
received," said Donald Thulean, director of orchestra services for the League. 
"On the other hand, some people started thinking a conductor had to be a 
Bernstein to be successful and, of course, there's only one Bernstein." 
</P>
<P>
The hard truth of modern-day musical Darwinism may be that only the suave 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that George Szell could not make music (today) 
the way he did before," says Deborah Rutter, executive director of the Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra, whose music director, Iona Brown, is known to rub 
elbows with the best of them at important fund-raising events. "The community 
of musicians and the community of audiences is a completely different universe 
than it was then -- 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Some would disagree with that assessment, arguing that talent, no matter what 
face it presents, will out. But it would have to be an extraordinary talent. 
</P>
<P>
"You could stand (a non-social conductor) if the product he created was such 
that nobody could equal it," says Preston Stedman, a Pacific Symphony board 
member and head of the search committee that chose St. Clair. "He could be a 
reincarnation of the devil, but if he did such a beautiful job on the podium, 
you'd say 'OK, that's it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rutter quickly cautions that no amount of socializing skill will substitute for 
competence on the podium. Still, as Vogel says, if a music director doesn't 
like to deal with social obligations, "it can be a real problem. One of the 
things that brought down (former Vancouver Symphony music director Rudolf) 
Barshai is that he hated doing it, refused to do it and alienated many people 
in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Romanian-born conductor Sergiu Comissiona was appointed in February as 
Vancouver's new music director, replacing the Russian-born Barshai, who left 
the post in 1988 after failing, by most accounts, to establish a connection 
with audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't do a lot of that (community relations) side of the job -- he was 
more concerned with the musical issues," says Vancouver promotions manager 
Muriel Schubert. "In our search for a new music director," adds Diane Hoar, the 
orchestra's chief executive officer, "the search committee was very conscious 
of . . . an expectation our community has that our music director will be 
involved in the community as well as with the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Most orchestra officials suggest that anyone with Szell-like talent probably 
wouldn't be turned down for a job. Yet, they unanimously stress the blessings 
of finding a musically qualified conductor who also is willing to dive into 
promotional activities. 
</P>
<P>
"If Herbert Blomstedt said to us tomorrow, 'I will do no more administrative 
tasks whatsoever; I won't go to receptions, I won't go to board meetings,' we'd 
still want him to be our music director because we think he's a great musician 
and a great music director. But we would lose something," says Peter Pastreich, 
executive director of the San Francisco Symphony, adding that Blomstedt has 
played a direct and significant role in getting a number of major donations to 
the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Symphony Assn. is in the unenviable position of having no orchestra, 
much less a music director. The previous director, Philippe Entremont, resigned 
in 1989 in frustration over budget cuts instituted by the board in an 
unsuccessful effort to keep the debt-plagued orchestra afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Maxwell, executive director of the symphony association that currently 
is trying to negotiate a reunion with musicians who seceded over money 
problems, said: "I would venture to say that if the Denver Symphony Orchestra 
had had at the time a strong music director -- somebody of international 
renown, living here and far more identified with the fortunes of the orchestra 
-- some of the events of 1989 might not have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it's not simply a conductor's willingness or lack of willingness to rally 
for money that executives prize most. 
</P>
<P>
"The crucial thing is not so much the social component, but the commitment of 
the conductor to study the operation of the orchestra," Pacific Symphony's 
Stedman added. "(It is) finding out how he can spread the word, how he can move 
the orchestra forward." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most officials say that the most valuable sales pitch a music director 
can make is not one that is preceded by a dollar sign. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore Symphony music director David Zinman "is a great source of enthusiasm 
for the board," said executive director John Gidwitz. "It is very helpful for 
him to articulate his vision of the orchestra's mission to them." 
</P>
<P>
Said San Francisco's Pastreich: "The most effective music director doesn't just 
go see some donors and come to a few board meetings, but shows in every 
rehearsal how he deals with problems -- whether he faces them or turns away 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like if your visiting somebody's house and you see something that's 
broken -- you don't fix it because it's not your house," Pastreich said. "If it 
is your house, either you have to fix it or you've got to get it fixed. I think 
the great music directors are the people who recognize that this is their 
house."

RUSTAVI ARRIVES IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Onstage at the Wiltern Theatre, 20 men of the Rustavi Company from Soviet 
Georgia enter in a line from the right, their faces in profile, their arms 
across one another's shoulders and their legs sharply kicking out and pulling 
back as if in a repeated salute. 
</P>
<P>
As they move into five-man lines and then circle formations, the dancers change 
hand-holds and step-patterns without disturbing the severe formality of the 
piece, the sense of a single consciousness directing a single body. And as they 
exit, their heads and upper bodies remain absolutely steady as they do a unison 
skip-step, with legs tucked up high in the air behind them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This venerable Georgian-Adzar military dance called "Khorumi" may lack the 
virtuoso turns and knee-drops that Rustavi unleashes during its "Mtiuluri" 
finale, or the sense of danger in the spark-spitting sword fights of 
"Parikaoba", but it sets a standard for corps unanimity that few companies of 
any kind could surpass. (Even the Rustavi women don't come close in their 
serene, gliding "Narnani" showpiece.) 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, the restraint and dignity of "Khorumi" reveals Rustavi's 
fundamental respect for its cultural resources -- and, for audiences wary of 
the corrupt charades that often pass for folk dance these days, that revelation 
brings a great shock of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Where the better-known Georgian State Dance Company (seen at the Pantages in 
1988) balleticized Georgian dance technique and crammed its choreography 
(including "Khorumi") with the maximum number of stunts, Rustavi is the real 
thing: an authentic, unashamed folk troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Don Cossacks, it assumes that its American audiences actually like 
folk music and dance, that we want something more than another evening of 
ballet divertissements and gymnastic displays staged in pseudo-ethnic style. 
</P>
<P>
We want it, we get it: for starters, a virtual seminar in Georgian vocal 
tradition, courtesy of Badri Toidze and his men's chorus. Usually 
unaccompanied, the work songs, patriotic anthems, lyrical ballads and humorous 
ditties here each seem to exploit a different technique, another kind of attack 
-- though many of them are alike in their emphasis on vivacity and thrust over 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
Other folk companies use singers as filler: time out for the dancers to change 
costumes. Rustavi, however, taps into the new, worldwide interest in antique 
choral music with a generous sampling of regional specialties. The public 
responds with all-American dog-yelps -- a vocal tradition of our own. After 
intermission, many audience members carry Rustavi CDs or cassettes and intently 
listen to every word of a language they're never going to speak. For once, the 
dancers can wait. 
</P>
<P>
Instrumental interludes highlight the Georgian pipe, drum and lute, while the 
dance accompaniments are often accordion-based. Thus, again, weight is 
nullified as even the most assaultive dances float on a kind of sonic breeze. 
In addition, Georgian style keeps the women skimming the stage as if 
hydro-cushioned and the men springing onto their toes as if about to take 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
No, contrary to what you may have heard, the Rustavi men don't dance on pointe 
-- their feet here are crimped or sickled, almost claw-like. (By its very 
nature, pointe requires a pointed foot, one that extends the line of the leg. 
Toes that curl under are something else entirely: as different as an open hand 
and a closed fist.) Nor are Georgians the only people to dance in this 
extremely difficult manner; you can also find folkloric dancers in Turkey 
poised on the knuckles of their bent toes. 
</P>
<P>
But the gushy misinformation preceding the Rustavi engagement shouldn't negate 
the company's remarkable achievement: Choreographer Fridon Sulaberidze shows us 
movement bristling with exciting angularities, asymmetries and gestural 
references to Georgian life. The men's vocabulary looks particularly rich, 
powerful, self-sufficient and you just know that these guys wouldn't rather be 
doing cabrioles or coupe jetes. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes we may be reminded of ballet -- in "Mountain Suite," for example, 
when the women appear in costumes startlingly similar to those in the original 
Nijinsky "Sacre du Printemps." But that's our obsession. 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, Rustavi has rediscovered something pure and essential, bringing it to 
the stage with its essence intact. In folk-dance terms, that's pretty much like 
the recent political events in Eastern Europe: a repudiation of a corrupt 
history. We can only marvel at the result.

TAPER'S 'VISIONS' MAKES CONNECTIONS;

<P>
THEATER: A STRONG START FOR THE FESTIVAL OF SO-CALLED ABSURDIST AND 
QUASI-ABSURDIST PLAYS. THE WORKS SEEM FUNNIER, MORE ACCESSIBLE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are we ready for this? Thirteen plays from the '50s and '60s, undiluted, 
unupdated, unmolested by self-important directors and relatively untampered 
with? 
</P>
<P>
This writer is. For one. 
</P>
<P>
A look back is almost always an enhancement to looking ahead. It makes for 
interesting connections. And Edward Parone, who conceived and produced "50/60 
Vision," the festival of so-called absurdist and quasi-absurdist plays at the 
Mark Taper Forum, has been picky about which ones to include (less picky about 
which ones to exclude, but we can't have everything). The first three -- Harold 
Pinter's "The Collection" and Samuel Beckett's "Play" and "Krapp's Last Tape" 
-- kicked off the event at a press preview Tuesday, attended by an enthusiastic 
but smallish audience. Why? 
</P>
<P>
Is anyone out there intimidated by these plays? No need to be. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the passage of time has only magnified their large quotient of 
humor, and changing theatrical conventions -- new then but familiar now, their 
mold forever shattered by some of these very plays -- have made them 
accessible. Starting with Beckett's 30-minute "Play." What comedy could be more 
human than that of three people standing in their funerary urns, only their 
talking heads exposed, endlessly regurgitating the important events in their 
lives -- events that also happened to link them to one another and may have 
provoked their deaths? 
</P>
<P>
These dead persons, who may not know they're dead, were once in love or at 
least in lust. The man (John Nesci) is eternally (and interchangeably) flanked 
by his mistress and his wife (Teri Garr and Gloria Mann). They speak a mile a 
minute and it's nearly impossible to follow what they say, except that they say 
it three times and eventually you get it -- or the hang of it. It is about 
nothing less ordinary than a garden variety menage a trois, with the usual 
lies, deceptions, omissions and double-dealings. But it's amazing how funny 
they look in perspective, let alone the perspective of the "other" side -- 
particularly when the man can't get rid of the final vestige of his fleshly 
existence: a totally silly hiccup. 
</P>
<P>
It's salvation humor, the laughter one chooses when one is well beyond tears. 
As in Krapp's case. 
</P>
<P>
The ruined old man at the center of "Krapp's Last Tape" is still trying to 
figure out what hit him. Where did his youth, ambition, affirmation and energy 
all go? We hear their former presence in the arrogant timbre of his voice 
resurrected on the old spoooooools (a word he rolls around his mouth like 
butterscotch candy) on his battered reel-to-reel, as he sits disheveled in his 
disheveled room. (True, despite their decrepit condition, the recorder and 
tapes sound very state-of-the-art, but let's leave it at dramatic license -- or 
excusable trompe l'oreille.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nesci plays Krapp as a booming King Lear, sneaking bananas and stealing nips 
from a bottle he keeps under lock and key. In his solitary state, Krapp -- the 
name is not an onomatopoeic accident -- is reduced to concealing his drinking 
from himself. Tears would be an unthinkable alternative in such a state of 
terminal self-derision. So Krapp opts for fierceness -- a railing legacy on his 
"last" tape. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Pinter, the interplay becomes more circumspect and more 
weighted with earthly preoccupations. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Collection," directed by Carey Perloff, we confront the instability of 
truth. James (Christopher Allport) has reason to believe that his wife Stella 
(Maria O'Brien) has fooled around with Bill (Michael Tulin), a young man who 
lives with an older man named Harry (Alan Oppenheimer). 
</P>
<P>
The pace is deliberate, the action pregnant with those notorious Pinter pauses, 
the air fraught with confrontation and repressed violence, the language 
laconic. 
</P>
<P>
The humor? Implicit in re-experiencing a situation where everything is visible 
and nothing is clear. Is Bill bisexual? Did he have an affair with Stella? Did 
he not? Why is James so fascinated with Bill? How far will he push it? How far 
will Harry let him push it? And what of Stella, about whom nobody seems to care 
very much at all? 
</P>
<P>
There are no answers. This is a theater that loves to ask questions, earthly 
and not-so-earthly. It is not about sets (though Yael Pardess has provided 
perfectly decent ones) or lights (Paulie Jenkins delivers the requisite ones) 
or costumes (no one looks out of place in Julie Weiss' costumes). 
</P>
<P>
And it is not about directors. Perloff, Michael Arabian (he staged "Krapp's 
Last Tape") and Daniel O'Connor ("Play") are to be commended for the extent to 
which they remain invisible. "50/60 Vision" is about writers. Ten more plays to 
go.

'Elvis' Takes a Break: "Elvis," the low-rated ABC series about the early life 
of the great pop star, will be yanked from the schedule following Sunday's 
broadcast, the network said Wednesday. ABC said that "Elvis" will continue in 
production and will return in a new time slot later this year. It will be 
replaced at 8:30 p.m. Sundays by a variety of programs, including episodes of 
"Doogie Howser, M.D." on March 25, "Roseanne" on April 1 and "Home Videos" on 
April 8. Last Sunday, "Home Videos" was the top-rated program in the country, 
attracting viewers in 22.2 million homes at 8 p.m., but more than half of them 
tuned out when "Elvis" began at 8:30 p.m. CLAUDIA PUIG

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: JAZZ PIANIST HANK JONES IS A MAN WITH A 
NOTABLE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pianist Hank Jones has a resume that reads like a jazz Hall of Fame. How many 
musicians can tell first-hand stories about Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins and 
Lester Young? 
</P>
<P>
Jones, the eldest brother from a musical family which also produced drummer 
Elvin and big band trumpeter Thad, opened two weeks at Elario's on Wednesday 
night, backed by San Diegans Bob Magnusson on bass and Jim Plank on drums. 
</P>
<P>
Known as a sensitive accompanist and superb improviser with a controlled, 
melodic style, Jones remains vital at 71. 
</P>
<P>
He recently recorded an album under the Great Jazz Trio name he founded in the 
early '80s with bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams. This time around, 
Jones worked with Danish bassist Mads Winding and drummer Billy Hart. In 
February, he participated in the tribute to Ella Fitzgerald at Avery Fisher 
Hall in New York, along with a Who's Who of jazz. He plays often in such top 
New York clubs as Fat Tuesday's, Indigo Blue and the Village Vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
You'd expect to hear tales of bruised egos about growing up in Pontiac, Mich., 
in a family of such formidable talents, but Jones said there were no conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no competition. We were all in the same family. I was the only one 
interested in piano. Thad was always interested in trumpet, and Elvin 
interested in drums. I had the piano to myself. We didn't play together a lot 
growing up. I was ahead of them, and I left home six or seven years before they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he doesn't see any contemporary jazz artists equal to the geniuses 
he worked with during the '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, it was a once in a lifetime type of thing. Hawkins, Young, Parker 
-- how often do you have this kind of genius in a century? I don't know anyone 
today who can compare. They were distinctive because they had a distinctive 
style." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins was "proficient in any key, he had marvelous jazz instincts," Jones 
recalled. Young had a distinctive tone and a weird way of holding his horn -- 
horizontally, like a flute. 
</P>
<P>
As for Parker, he more than challenged his fellow players with his lightning 
be-bop lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Challenge is a mild term," Jones said. "He had a marvelous ability to play 
very fast and execute flawlessly. His tone was superb. Most people who play 
fast suffer in tone. His tone on alto was one of main things you noticed. He 
had the ability to play both rapid tempos and beautiful ballads." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was looking forward to his stay in San Diego. He hasn't been here since 
the late '40s. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego guitarist Hank Easton's nine-song CD will be in local music stores, 
including Tower Records, within the next week. Easton hopes the recording will 
land him a distribution deal. Positive responses are already coming. The Wave, 
the national Chicago-based radio network, wants to put his song "San Diego 
Sunset" into rotation, but Easton wants to wait until his album is more widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
At 26, he is one of San Diego's most promising guitarists. Technically, he's 
got all the tools. In his work, you can hear snippets of those he considers his 
mentors: George Benson, Carlos Santana, Jeff Beck, Robben Ford, Larry Carlton, 
Stanley Jordan, Jim Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Kitchen Sink," the one blues tune on the CD, Easton departs from his 
penchant for technical fireworks to show that less can be more. 
</P>
<P>
All of the songs were written by Easton and reveal a promising FM radio 
riffmaster at work. Easton has opened for Michael Brecker, Acoustic Alchemy, 
Kirk Whalum and Lee Ritenour, and it wouldn't come as a surprise if he 
eventually enjoys the same kind of success. 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday, Easton plays the Mission Bay Hilton Hotel's Sunday brunch from 
10:30 to 1. On March 23, 24, 30 and 31, he'll be at the Del Mar Hilton from 9 
p.m. to 1 a.m. On April 7, his Easton West Band will be one of four rising 
young bands showcased at the Bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Baritone sax master Nick Brignola drew a less-than-capacity crowd to 
last weekend's concert at the San Diego Convention Center. Roughly half of 400 
seats were taken. Some fans who called Ticketmaster were mistakenly told that 
the concert was sold out. Friday and Sunday nights, Brignola sat in with 
buddies Dave McKenna and Scott Hamilton at Elario's. . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans Bob Magnusson (bass) and Randy Porter (piano) joined former San 
Diegan John Guerin on drums to back up jazz singer Diane Schuur in Los Angeles 
last weekend. Porter, 27, plans to release a self-produced CD of mostly 
original music in about a month. Porter, Magnusson and San Diego drummer Jim 
Plank will back jazz trumpet legend Art Farmer at Elario's for two weeks 
beginning March 28. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Some local light jazz stalwarts are also versed in straight-ahead jazz. At the 
Mission Bay Hilton's 4-month-old Tuesday night jazz jams, hosted by 
percussionist and vocalist Mike Kelleher of Reel to Real, top local musicians 
play a mix of light jazz and straight-ahead standards. Hank Easton, guitarist 
Kiko Cibrian, bass man Charlie Chadwick and sax man Mark Lessman have been 
among the more than 100 locals who have jammed so far. Lessman's band plays the 
Catamaran's "Jazz Trax Nite" next Wednesday. The next of the monthly "Lites Out 
Desert Weekends" at La Casa Del Zorro in Borrego Springs is April 27 to 29. For 
the price of accommodations, guests will enjoy performances by Hollis Gentry 
and Most Valuable Players, including a Friday night jam session. Visitors 
frequently join the musicians for a game of basketball. This Sunday's special 
guest on "Jazz Trax" is saxophonist Sam Riney, whose newest album has been 
running a close second to Kenny G.'s on the national "contemporary jazz" 
charts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cibrian and other member of Gentry's band Neon have left to form their own 
group called True Stories.

Benefit in Debt: The independent committee that organized last Sunday's opera 
and ballet gala in Pasadena to benefit the AIDS Hospice Foundation is $100,000 
in debt, said George Schleder, director of the From the Heart Committee. 
</P>
<P>
No major corporate sponsor was found and only 900 of about 3,000 tickets were 
sold. Organizers had to scale back the gala, and some of the performers 
originally scheduled to appear were forced to drop out of the program. Schleder 
hopes to erase the debt and contribute $250,000 to the AIDS Hospice Foundation 
by selling limited edition $1,200 lithographs of the event's logo. CLAUDIA PUIG

Davis Out of Hospital: Sammy Davis Jr. is at home in Beverly Hills after being 
released Tuesday from Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he underwent several weeks 
of chemotherapy for a recurrence of throat cancer. A spokeswoman says Davis, 
64, will concentrate on resting and building his strength. He was first 
diagnosed as having carcinoma of the throat last September and was forced to 
drop out of a concert tour with Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra so he could 
undergo radiation treatment. CLAUDIA PUIG

ADULT BOOKSTORE TO LEAVE IN A YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE MANAGER PLEADS NO CONTEST TO A MISDEMEANOR. CITY OFFICIALS EXULT AT 
HIS DECISION TO LEAVE AFTER A 3-YEAR BATTLE. 
</P>

In an apparent victory for Glendale officials, the manager of the city's only 
sexually oriented book and video store will move his business out of the city 
within about a year, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Roger Diamond said Gary Enea, who operates Total News and Video at 
6524 San Fernando Road, has been driven out of town by the city's three-year 
campaign against him. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary doesn't want to be where he's not welcome," Diamond said, "so he's going 
to leave the city." 
</P>
<P>
City officials were exultant. 
</P>
<P>
"That sounds wonderful," said City Councilman Larry Zarian. "In my mind, he's 
not a welcome business. He has not contributed anything to this community. I 
say, 'hooray.' " 
</P>
<P>
Diamond made the announcement shortly after Enea pleaded no contest to one 
criminal misdemeanor charge of violating a city ordinance banning fully 
enclosed video display booths in a store that offers adult entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Enea and four other defendants, including two store clerks, originally had been 
charged with eight counts each of failing to comply with a city ordinance 
requiring the booths to be open, well lighted and visible. 
</P>
<P>
But Enea agreed to comply with the ordinance after City Atty. Scott H. Howard 
agreed to drop all but one count against him and all counts against the other 
defendants. Glendale Municipal Judge Cheryl Krott placed Enea on three years' 
probation and ordered him to bring the store into compliance by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Enea did not return phone calls. But, Diamond said, his client will obey the 
court's orders, then obtain an extension that will allow him to continue 
operating his store at its present location for one more year. After that, 
he'll leave the city, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Enea's reported plans and the court ruling last week marked the latest chapter 
in a three-year battle between the city and Enea, whom officials have accused 
of running a store that sells sexually explicit materials and provides a site 
for homosexual liaisons. 
</P>
<P>
Total News and Video has been operating in Glendale since May, 1986. In 
November, 1987, Krott found Enea and the owner of the store, then at 5130 San 
Fernando Road, guilty of violating a city use and occupancy permit after 
closet-size "peep show" booths were installed without city permission a week 
after the store opened. 
</P>
<P>
Krott fined Enea and the owner and ordered them to shut down the booths, ruling 
that they could not operate them in an industrial part of Glendale. In 1988, 
the business moved out of the industrial area and into its present location to 
reopen the booths. But it quickly faced more trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the City Council adopted an ordinance confining 
adult-entertainment businesses to the downtown commercial district. The 
ordinance banning fully enclosed peep booths quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond said last week that the "collective acts" of the city were made 
purposely to drive Enea out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe very strongly in free enterprise," Diamond said. "If there was no 
demand for his products, he would go out of business right away. It's not the 
people who are against him, because they support him economically. It's the 
city officials. And it's clear that city officials have been driving him out. 
</P>
<P>
Although the First Amendment prohibits the outright banning of 
adult-entertainment businesses, the judge denied Enea a constitutional defense, 
allowing Diamond only to argue the issues of the second ordinance under which 
his client was charged, Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian maintained that city officials have pressured Enea's business but have 
not prevented it from operating. Howard said his goal was merely to enforce the 
city's ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling of what the city is trying to do never entered into this 
case," Howard said. "I've always offered that all we wanted was full compliance 
with the law." 
</P>
<P>
That, Diamond said, is what the city will get. He said Enea is willing to pay 
what he estimates will be $23,000 to remove the booths and improve lighting in 
the hope that the city will grant him a one-year extension before requiring him 
to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
"If he can stay for another year, then it's economically worthwhile" to 
renovate the store, Diamond said. "Otherwise, it wouldn't have made sense to 
remodel and then have to move by April 7. 
</P>
<P>
"After that," the attorney added, "Gary's going to leave the city. He 
understands that he's not welcome in Glendale."

SCHOOL WORKERS' VOTE FAILS TO ABOLISH PERSONNEL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disgruntled classified employees in the Glendale Unified School District 
narrowly failed last week to abolish the 24-year-old "merit system" of hiring, 
firing and promotion they claimed is outdated and cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the yearlong effort needed 504 votes -- representing a majority 
of the district's 1,006 clerks, maintenance workers and other non-teaching 
staff -- to overhaul the personnel system, which regulates hiring, disciplinary 
and firing procedures of classified employees. They fell 66 votes short of a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
The merit system was initiated in the district in 1966 as a solution to 
patronage in personnel practices. It is run by a three-member commission that 
administers hiring and testing procedures, promotions and employee grievances. 
Commissioners are appointed and operate independently of the Board of Education 
or district superintendent. They also appoint their own personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled classified employees, led by the Committee for Responsible 
Personnel Practices and the California School Employees Assn., have argued that 
collective bargaining and protections under the state Education Code have made 
the merit system unnecessary. They have complained that the system is 
chronically problematic. Testing for jobs is cumbersome and unfair, 
commissioners know little about employees' affairs and often simply rubber 
stamp the recommendations of the personnel director, they have said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the commissioners have been unresponsive to us," Mary Meehan, a 
data programmer and president of the local California School Employees Assn. 
chapter, said after the defeat. "These are three people who have outside, 
full-time important jobs and come into the district once a month. We really 
feel like when we bring something up, they're not in a position to respond, so 
they just rubber stamp the director's decision." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners, responding angrily to those charges, said employees have not 
clearly cited their concerns, offered suggestions on how to improve the merit 
system or shown much interest by attending commission meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's bunk," said Michael Myers, a personnel commissioner and a 
corporate lawyer in Los Angeles. "It's extremely difficult to respond to an 
empty room. It is certain that in the course of dealing with 1,000 or so 
classified employees there are going to be actions taken or things done that 
are wrong. But if they're brought to the attention of the commission, we'll do 
our best to correct them." 
</P>
<P>
About 438 employees in last week's election voted to abolish the system, 155 
voted to retain it and 52 of the ballots were invalidated because they were 
returned too late or were improperly filled out, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some 361 employees did not vote in the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the commission remains, it was not a vote of confidence," said 
Travers Devine, a field representative for the California School Employees 
Assn., the classified employees' union. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high number of employees who voted to abolish the system, Devine 
and others say they are confident that administrators of the personnel system 
will "heed the message" and reform hiring, disciplinary and firing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is what we have been stating all along: that people are not happy 
with the personnel system and that things need to change," said local president 
Meehan. "I think we've won in a way because we believe our message has gotten 
through. We're hopeful that things will be better." 
</P>
<P>
But two of the three personnel commissioners said no broad changes will be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious there are large numbers of employees who are or were unhappy with 
the conditions under which they worked," Myers said. "But the system is a 
decent system and properly administered. I think things will pretty much stay 
as they are." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a fair system," said Mildred Teal, a personnel commissioner who 
also is an attorney. "It favors employees and works in their best interests. 
Are there any testing or hiring procedures that need to be changed? Not right 
off hand, no." 
</P>
<P>
A similar referendum is scheduled to begin on March 23 at Glendale Community 
College, where some 250 classified employees will be asked to vote whether to 
abolish their merit system. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the drive against the system said their campaign has encouraged 
employees to attend commission hearings and communicate their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see them take a long, hard look at some of their rules, such as 
testing procedures, which are overly complicated," Devine said. "I'd like them 
to consider having state validated testing. In addition, I'd like them to look 
at their procedures and classification interests in a little more depth than 
they have in the past." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners and organizers agreed that the voting process educated 
employees about the merit system and improved communication between the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that Robert Read, who recently was named the district's 
personnel director, may help smooth out differences between the commission and 
employees. The former director, Sandra Leonard, resigned in August, shortly 
after disgruntled employees began their campaign, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Read, a former personnel director in West Covina, said he has worked under 
merit and non-merit systems and has no preference. He declined to comment on 
the issue in Glendale, saying he has had little time to examine it. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe very firmly that he's going to fulfill his promise to work on the 
problems," said Meehan, who was consulted by the commission before it selected 
Read. "We don't expect miracles."

MORE PROTECTION FOR BUTTERFLY HABITAT SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: COASTAL COMMISSION AGREES TO TAKE FIVE FEET OFF THE HEIGHT OF A 
HOUSE TO BE BUILT NEAR A SANCTUARY FOR MONARCHS. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THE 
CONCESSION DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. 
</P>

<P>
Real estate ads had hailed the two-acre property in Malibu's Encinal Canyon as 
offering a stunning ocean view -- and more: Part of the acreage was a habitat 
for the Monarch butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
So when a new owner bought the property last year with plans to tear down its 
house and tennis court and build three expensive homes, butterfly enthusiasts 
were upset that the developer wanted to chop down some of the very trees that 
provide a winter home to an estimated 20,000 Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition of butterfly enthusiasts, last November the state 
Coastal Commission allowed several trees to be removed after a lawyer for owner 
Moses Lerner testified that they were diseased. 
</P>
<P>
Chagrined butterfly enthusiasts, saying the property represents one of the few 
Monarch habitats left on the Pacific Coast, were back before the state panel 
again this week, asking for the habitat's protection. 
</P>
<P>
In line with a recommendation from its staff, the commission voted 7 to 5 
Tuesday to trim five feet from the height of one of the houses, to reduce the 
shade that would be cast on the remaining trees. 
</P>
<P>
The butterfly's advocates regarded the height reduction as a small concession. 
"I don't think what they did will make any difference in saving the habitat 
from destruction," said Sarah Dixon, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the house, to be built within 20 feet of a group of 
eucalyptus trees in which the Monarchs roost, may destroy the habitat by 
lowering the temperature enough so that the butterflies will no longer go 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The spot, next to expensive homes overlooking the ocean above Broad Beach, is 
one of three havens in the Malibu area for the migrating Monarchs, who come 
from as far away as Colorado each winter to roost in a few well-established 
sanctuaries near the California coast and in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarch is widely admired for its colorful burnt-orange and black wings, 
and local laws protect them in a few places, such as Santa Barbara County and 
the city of Pacific Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The Entomological Society of America has even proposed that the Monarch be 
designated the national insect. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's hearing, Walter Sakai, a Santa Monica College biology 
professor, alluding to the butterfly's popularity, suggested: "In a year or 
two, the Monarch may be our national insect, and it may not reflect well on the 
Coastal Commission not to act now to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
Sakai, who said he would prefer to see nothing built close to the trees, asked 
the commissioners to "err on the side of the butterfly" in at least reducing 
the proposed height. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Patrick Wells, an Occidental College biologist and a 
consultant for the developer, disputed Sakai's claim that to allow the house to 
be built next to the trees would threaten the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
"My professional answer to that question is no," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During an hourlong discussion that sometimes seemed more in keeping with a 
biology class than a Coastal Commission hearing, a majority of panel members 
supported a motion by Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, who lives in Malibu, to 
reduce the building's height. 
</P>
<P>
However, several commissioners expressed concern about where to draw the line 
in protecting animal life. 
</P>
<P>
"We get one doctor of something or other that tells us one thing. And another 
(expert) who tells us something entirely different," said Commissioner Donald 
McInnis, who voted against the height restriction. "In the end, each of us has 
to make his own judgment." 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT VS. THE MONARCH 
</P>
<P>
* The Monarch is one of about 200 species of the Danainae subfamily, or the 
Milkweed Butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
* Adults are large. The Monarch, which often soars or glides between wing 
flaps, is the most strongly migratory butterfly in the world. 
</P>
<P>
* They habitat mostly in open places, especially moist valley bottoms. Tree 
provide important resting sites for overwintering.

SCHOOL BOARD BUDGET CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica-Malibu school board on Monday voted to close swimming pools, 
cut gardener and nursing slots and halt the hiring of "non-essential" employees 
to grapple with a projected deficit of up to $2 million in next school year's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts, totaling about $570,000, also include closing the instructional media 
office and instead buying film services from the county, eliminating two 
permanent substitute teacher positions at Santa Monica High School, eliminating 
an audiovisual equipment maintenance position and instead contracting the work 
out, and slashing most custodial supervisory posts. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the cuts are scheduled to take effect in July and afterward, the 
hiring freeze on non-essential positions takes effect immediately. Supt. Eugene 
Tucker will decide which jobs are non-essential, Arthur Cohen, assistant 
superintendent for fiscal services, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
More potential cuts will be discussed in during the next few months, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district's general fund budget for the 1990-91 school year is estimated to 
be $35 million, Cohen said. The deficit, which could be as much as $2 million, 
is "simply the situation that expenditure level, as set in the district last 
year, cannot be matched with this coming year's revenues that have been 
projected." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Dan Ross said after the meeting that the district is 
approaching the city of Santa Monica about receiving some financial aid. The 
city in the past has given about $500,000 a year to the district, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The board will hold hearings on a final budget in May. By law, the budget must 
be adopted before the start of the new fiscal year July 1.

<P>
LAND-USE PLAN RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited preliminary draft of a coastal plan directing the development of 
Venice has been released for public comment, said City Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
The land-use plan covers a broad outline of policy directions in seven areas, 
including shoreline access, recreational facilities and water and marine 
resources, Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
It will be supplemented with separate plans for three geographic areas. 
</P>
<P>
The state-mandated Venice Local Coastal Program is a blueprint for development 
restrictions and coastal protection in Venice. "State law requires that we 
balance the needs of Venice today with the needs of Venice tomorrow," Galanter 
said in a written news release. 
</P>
<P>
On March 19, public workshops are scheduled from 5 to 9 p.m. at which residents 
may informally question planning officials and discuss the contents of the 
plan. A formal public hearing will be held March 28, with sessions at 5 and 7 
p.m. All of the events will take place at Venice High School, 13000 Venice 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Free copies of the plan are available at the Venice Branch Library, 600 
California Ave.; the Westminster Senior Center, 1234 Pacific Ave.; the 
Westchester Municipal Building, 7166 W. Manchester Ave., and Val's Pharmacy, 
1600 Pacific Ave., Venice.

PARKS WORKER ARRESTED OVER THEFT OF CITY PAVING BLOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Glendale parks worker accused of stealing nine tons of paving blocks 
from a city yard was arrested Monday and ordered to stay home from work this 
week pending disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Bowman, 46, a 21-year city employee, surrendered to police after 
grand theft charges were filed against him in Glendale Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment is scheduled March 26. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, 1,327 concrete paving blocks missing from a city 
yard were found in the rear of Bowman's home in Glendale, laid out to form a 
20-by-30-foot parking area. The hexagonal-shaped blocks are valued at more than 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said police are continuing to investigate the disappearance of 
more than 400 other blocks also taken over a period of several weeks from a 
locked maintenance yard at the Scholl Canyon baseball fields. Officials said 
more than 100 employees have keys to the yard. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began in January after police and city officials received an 
anonymous phone call and a letter from a tipster who reported witnessing two 
employees loading blocks into their private vans at the city yard. No other 
arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Nello Iacono, director of parks, recreation and community services, said the 
theft of city-owned materials by an employee is the first incidence of its kind 
that he can recall in his 12 years with the city.

PETITIONS BATTLE OVER SCHOOL MOVE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PARENTS PROTEST PLAN TO RELOCATE UCLA EXPERIMENTAL SCHOOL IN SANTA 
MONICA. BUT SOME RESIDENTS ARE SUPPORTING THE MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The controversy over the plan to move UCLA's experimental elementary school 
into the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District turned Monday's Santa 
Monica school board meeting into a battle of petitions. 
</P>
<P>
Parents protesting the relocation presented a petition with more than 2,000 
signatures, stating that moving the Corinne A. Seed University Elementary 
School into a public school system would compromise research at the school. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Monica resident also presented a petition to the board supporting the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
The school, commonly referred to by the acronym UES, is California's only 
remaining laboratory school. Free of state education requirements and a local 
school board, it tests new teaching techniques and philosophies on its 
students. 
</P>
<P>
The petition said the site proposed for the school, a portion of Los Amigos 
Park in the city's Ocean Park area, would result in a loss of irreplaceable 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
Shayna Roosevelt, 10, and three other UES students read a student petition to 
the school board, noting that the school's idyllic nine-acre site at UCLA 
provides "special places to be alone" and for "talking behind trees." The 
students said they fear their teachers will quit if the school is moved. 
</P>
<P>
Consideration of the move started more than a year ago, when UCLA disclosed 
plans to build a new graduate business school on part of the laboratory 
school's site. UCLA announced last month that it will proceed with the move. 
</P>
<P>
The state and the Santa Monica-Malibu school district must approve the plan 
before the move occurs. 
</P>
<P>
The school board, which will not vote on the move until a contract has been 
worked out, has assured UCLA that the university would retain full control over 
UES, Supt. Eugene Tucker has said. Within the next couple of months the 
district and UCLA staff will issue an "accurate statement of the educational 
advantages of moving the school," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Park resident Anna McDonnell gave the board a petition with 73 signatures 
supporting the move, which she said had been gathered in one afternoon, and she 
promised to collect more. She said she was annoyed by numerous flyers that have 
been left at her door by UES parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who're opposed (to the move) are very organized. . . . (But) it 
doesn't accurately reflect the way Ocean Park residents feel," she said later. 
</P>
<P>
The school board authorized Tucker to work with the UES admissions committee on 
recruiting 4-year-olds from low-income families in Ocean Park to attend UES at 
no cost to the parents, regardless of whether the school moves. The laboratory 
school is interested in enrolling up to 15 such children in September to help 
diversify its student body, Tucker said.

SANTA MONICA MUSEUM NEEDS NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than two years after finding a temporary home for its collection, the 
Santa Monica Historical Society may soon be without quarters once again. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe Enterprises had allowed the group to use about 5,000 square feet of an 
older building on Colorado Avenue free for the past 18 months, but the 
development company is now ready to demolish the building to make way for a 
large, mixed-use complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We were glad to help, but at some point we have to get the tenants out so we 
can demolish the building," said Rob Macleod, president of commercial 
development for Lowe Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The historical society was scheduled to vacate the building today, but Macleod 
has given the group additional time to find a new home or make plans for 
storing the collection of artifacts and documents that dates back to the 1820s. 
</P>
<P>
The historical society, which began in 1975 and established its museum less 
than two years ago, is hoping someone will provide for free or for a minimal 
fee about 6,000 square feet of office space to house its collection. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Gabriel, the group's president, said that if a new home cannot be found, 
the collection of maps, documents, photos and vintage clothing will have to be 
placed in storage. 
</P>
<P>
She said that without a museum the community would be missing something 
valuable. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more caring for a community when you understand its past," Gabriel 
said. "There is greater appreciation for what was done here so that it can be 
better for future generations. People go to Europe to see the treasures of the 
past; isn't it nice that Santa Monica has its past preserved so that people can 
come here." 
</P>
<P>
Since the museum opened in October, 1988, tours were provided for school 
children and community groups by appointment. In addition to exhibitions, the 
museum also provided an audiovisual history of Santa Monica Bay and a reference 
library on the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel said the group is hoping to begin a fund-raising drive to pay for a new 
building and for an executive director, which would allow the museum to stay 
open more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
To make a donation or assist in locating office space, contact Louise or Bob 
Gabriel at (213) 829-0305.

JUDGING TALENT FOR 'THE SHOW'; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: SCOUT CHUCK MCMICHAEL'S OPINIONS CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
SUCCESS AND FAILURE FOR YOUNG PLAYERS, AS WELL AS FOR THE ROYALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Chuck McMichael's tastes are simple. 
</P>
<P>
After spending 10 years combing the country in search of the next Bret 
Saberhagen or Bo Jackson, McMichael longs for nothing but the barest 
necessities. 
</P>
<P>
"Great bat speed, good runners and the sun -- that's what I enjoy," says 
McMichael, a scout for the Kansas City Royals. "I wish I had more time to fish 
and hike and do the other things I like, but baseball won't allow it." 
</P>
<P>
McMichael, a former Southern Section Player of the Year at Hoover High, is on 
the road more than 200 days a year for the Royals, watching and evaluating 
ballplayers who aspire to careers in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, McMichael, 34, has risen from part-time area scout in 
Southern California to Phoenix-based national cross-checker for one of 
baseball's most highly regarded organizations. As a national cross-checker, 
McMichael's main responsibility is to determine in what order prospects should 
be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, as he perused the talent on display at UCLA's Jackie Robinson 
Stadium during a series between the Bruins and USC, McMichael reflected upon 
his baseball career, which began at Hoover and has included stops at the 
University of Arizona, La Verne, the minor leagues and, finally, in scouting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm usually hanging around with guys (scouts) that are between 50 and 65 -- 
and that's a tremendous benefit," McMichael said. "These guys in scouting and 
player development are the heroes of the game with 15 to 30 years of experience 
that I can draw from." 
</P>
<P>
McMichael, a left-handed pitcher-center fielder, was named 4-A Player of the 
Year in 1975 after he compiled a 16-2 record and led Hoover to a Southern 
Section title. 
</P>
<P>
Chosen in the 10th round of the free-agent draft by the New York Mets, 
McMichael opted to attend Arizona and was a member of the Wildcats' 1976 NCAA 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, he was 6-2 with a team-low 3.00 earned-run average. Then he injured 
his knee playing summer ball in Alaska. The injury forced McMichael to redshirt 
his junior year and, after surgery and rehabilitation, he transferred to La 
Verne to complete his final two seasons of eligibility before signing with the 
Royals as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
McMichael played in the Gulf Coast Rookie League in 1980, then compiled a 7-1 
record and 3.43 ERA at Charleston in the Class-A South Atlantic League in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
When his contract for the next season arrived during the winter, McMichael 
expected to learn of his promotion to a higher Class-A league, or even a 
Double-A team. Instead, he received a player-coach contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I called back to Kansas City and said I still thought I was a prospect," 
McMichael recalled. "They basically told me, 'Well, we think you're a prospect 
-- a prospect as a manager.' " 
</P>
<P>
The news only managed to drive McMichael out of baseball and into his father's 
contracting business. However, about six months after spring training ended, 
McMichael was back on the phone to the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'Hey, I made a mistake, what can I do?' " McMichael said. "That's 
when they mentioned the scouting thing." 
</P>
<P>
Under the tutelage of veteran scouts such as Al Kubski, Rosie Gilhausen and Guy 
Hansen, McMichael's career advanced quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty obvious from the start that he had a good chance to be a good 
scout," Hansen said. "He had the ability to take what he saw and put it on 
paper, giving the cross-checker a good vision of what he was coming to see." 
</P>
<P>
Today, McMichael is on the receiving end of those reports, thereby 
necessitating long separations from his wife, Janice, and their five children, 
as he double-checks the work of area scouts by seeing high school, college, 
minor league and major league games as well as visiting the Dominican Republic 
and Venezuela. It's an inexact science for even the most experienced scout. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could sign 1,000 kids and have 900 clubs and let everybody play, but 
unfortunately it doesn't work that way," said McMichael, who lists San 
Francisco Giants first baseman Will Clark, Seattle Mariners outfielder Ken 
Griffey Jr. and Milwaukee Brewers infielder Gary Sheffield as the best 
prospects he ever saw. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we know what we're doing and I think we do a good job," he said. "But 
the fact of the matter is there's guys that go in the first round that never 
get out of A ball and there's guys who go in the 40th round that get to the big 
leagues in three years." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the uncertainty, the long hours and the time away from home that 
scouting demands, McMichael has no plans to leave baseball again. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy getting out and seeing the game," he says. "I giggle every morning 
when I get up and think they're paying me to do this."

PEPPERDINE WILL MISS NATIONAL TOURNEY, COACH DISAPPOINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine men's basketball Coach Tom Asbury said he is disappointed that his 
team, which finished the season with a 17-11 overall record, was not selected 
for the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he believes the cancellation of the West Coast 
Conference tournament after the death of Loyola Marymount star Hank Gathers was 
the correct decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves had been scheduled to play the University of San Diego in a 
tournament semifinal, but the rest of the conference tournament was canceled 
after Gathers collapsed in the first half of the Lions' semifinal against 
Portland and later died. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, the WCC regular-season champion, was awarded the conference's automatic 
bid to the NCAA tournament, but Pepperdine, which had hoped to go to the NIT 
for a third straight year, did not make the NIT's 32-team field. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, it was a disappointing way for us to end our season," Asbury 
said, "especially for the four seniors on the team (Craig Davis, Shann Ferch, 
Dexter Howard and Tom Lewis). 
</P>
<P>
"We went into the WCC tournament playing our best basketball of the season, and 
the team was confident it could beat Loyola Marymount in the championship game. 
(Pepperdine won eight of its last nine games.) 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, the conference had to suspend the league tournament. 
It was a difficult decision, but I believe the proper action was taken in light 
of Hank's death." 
</P>
<P>
The Waves had a 2-5 record against teams that are in the NCAA tournament. They 
defeated Loyola Marymount and Towson State, but lost to Loyola Marymount, 
Boston University, Kansas, North Carolina and UC Santa Barbara.

Asbury said: "In retrospect, the close losses that we had during the first half 
of the season came back to haunt us in March. We lost six ball games by a total 
of 14 points. If we had won just three of those games, our record would have 
been 20-8, and we would be preparing to play somebody this week."

THE AGONY OF NOT BEING THE BEST; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE TRACK: EVEN MORE PAINFUL THAN HIS INJURED HAND FOR BRUIN BRIAN 
BLUTREICH WAS THE REALIZATION THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE THE NATION'S BEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
UCLA shot-putter and discus thrower Brian Blutreich belonged to what may have 
been the best group of college track and field recruits anywhere when he first 
arrived at the school in the fall of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
His fellow freshmen included top sprinters Danny Everett, Mike Marsh and Henry 
Thomas and outstanding pole vaulter Brandon Richards. Some of his classmates 
went on to achieve distinction, and so has Blutreich -- but he hasn't done 
nearly as well as he and others had expected. 
</P>
<P>
And to get as far as he has, Blutreich has had to fight the demons of pain and 
self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
At Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo, the 6-foot 6-inch, 
270-pounder twice won state championships in both the shot put and discus and 
was ranked as the nation's best as a prep in both events. In 1986, his personal 
best mark of 63 feet, 5 3/4 inches in the shot put led the world's junior 
amateurs in the 19-and-younger age group. 
</P>
<P>
But the fifth-year senior has never reached the heights in college that he did 
in high school, and he may never do so. Yet, he hasn't stopped competing -- 
although he considered it a couple of years ago. He has simply lowered his 
expectations a little. 
</P>
<P>
He used to want to be the world's best in the shot and the discus. But after he 
suffered a severe hand injury in 1986 and a couple of lesser injuries, he says 
that he'll settle for being the nation's second-best college shot-putter and 
for breaking the UCLA record in the discus. 
</P>
<P>
Weight throwers not only need brute force to do their best, but they also seem 
to have to be mentally prepared, to psych themselves up, to make maximum 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich said that before the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in April of 1986 
"I was so ready for that meet it was ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't ready, however, for the injury he received while he was warming up 
that day: torn ligaments in his right, or throwing, hand. The bad hand has 
troubled him since that day, and only now is he nearly without pain. In 1986 
and 1987, he was also hampered by pain from a muscle imbalance in his back, 
caused, he said, "by a lot of power (weight) lifting" without other lifts 
necessary to strengthen his back muscles. 
</P>
<P>
But the injuries didn't keep him from setting UCLA freshman records of 60-2 1/2 
in the shot put and 190-9 in the discus in 1987, his first year of college 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he was third in the discus and fifth in the shot at the Pacific 10 
Conference meet and third in the discus and 12th in the shot at the NCAA meet. 
Last year he had his best season as a Bruin, winning the discus and finishing 
fourth in the shot at the Pac-10 meet and finishing third in the shot and 
fourth in the discus in the NCAAs after hurting his knee in the national meet. 
In 1989, his discus throw of 199-8 was a personal record which put him in 
fourth place on the all-time Bruin list. 
</P>
<P>
This year he hopes to break John Brenner's school record of 208-2 in the 
discus, but he thinks Brenner's school mark of 71-11 1/4 in the shot is beyond 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Those goals may seem modest for an athlete who came to UCLA with so much 
promise, but Blutreich is thankful that he has any goals at all in his sport. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has been through "a lot of very depressing times" because of his 
injuries and that there have been times "when I had the phone in hand and was 
ready to tell" UCLA weight events Coach Art Venegas that "I was going to 
retire." 
</P>
<P>
He said that at those times he felt he had had "enough success that I could 
quit and be happy. It was very frustrating that I was doing so badly and 
(others in his sport) were (doing well). 
</P>
<P>
"In 1987 and 1988, I felt worthless mentally and physically and had no 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
His hand injury, he said, was the worst "a shot-putter can have. You generate 
so much energy and power from your legs, and it all comes out through the hands 
. . . I was way in the dumpster." 
</P>
<P>
He said he thinks he got a leg out of the dumpster when he won the Pac-10 
discus championship last year. "Maybe that was a turning point for this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that his years of depression were good for him in a way 
because "I grew up a lot during those times (and became) a better person for 
it. I developed a lot of patience. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people thought I was taking drugs because I was not doing well, which 
gets you upset. . . . A lot of people really gave up on me, but not Art 
(Venegas) or my parents, who were very supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich said he also feels better this year because he lost 20 pounds since 
last season while improving his strength-to-weight ratio. "Your muscles mature 
as you get older, and you don't have to weigh as much." 
</P>
<P>
Thoughts of being the world's best no longer weigh heavily on his mind, either. 
</P>
<P>
Venegas said that last weekend Blutreich finished fourth in the shot put at the 
NCAA indoors championships at Indianapolis, posting a career-best mark of 61-8 
1/4. Mike Stulce of Texas A &amp; M won the meet with a heave of 70-6 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Indoor meets, Venegas said, are "just for exercise, to have fun out there" but 
that Blutreich's toss "points to some very good throws outdoors this season." 
</P>
<P>
Probably not good enough to beat Stulce in the NCAA meet, Venegas said. He said 
that Stulce, ranked fifth in the world in the shot put, "is by far the most 
dominant athlete in that event. Our goal is to take second behind Mike Stulce, 
to go 65 feet or better this year. But we're not giving up the possibility of 
winning; stranger things have happened." 
</P>
<P>
A more reasonable goal for Blutreich would be to take the NCAA discus 
championship. The discus, Venegas said, presents "more of a chance for upsets, 
is more of a crap shoot" because of such variables as wind conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich said that, though his bad hand still bothers him a little, he feels 
he has overcome many "mental barriers" and is ready to "start competing again. 
I'm aggressive and competitive, and I'm getting a lot more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Venegas says he makes it a rule not to praise "a competitor for competing" but 
that Blutreich "handles all those doubts in his mind real well." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason in the world that he shouldn't hit 65 feet (in the shot) 
this year," the coach said, and "I think he's got a legitimate chance at the 
school record in the discuss."

3 OF SHERIFF'S 4 NARCOTICS UNITS ALLEGEDLY STOLE CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The theft of drug money seized by narcotics officers has been a widespread 
practice in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for several years and 
has involved members of three elite narcotics squads, federal investigators 
alleged in affidavits unsealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the most detailed disclosures yet in a broadening money-skimming scandal, 
the affidavits filed by FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents portray veteran 
sheriff's narcotics officers as stealing money from suspected drug dealers and 
money launderers -- and sometimes squabbling over cash taken during the raids. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on information from one indicted officer, other deputies and their own 
months-long probe, federal investigators said that members of three of the four 
sheriff's narcotics squads investigating major drug cases were involved or were 
aware that money was stolen during drug raids, the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
No dollar amount was given for the alleged thefts, which some officers told 
investigators date back to the mid-1980s. But the affidavits, which were used 
to justify search warrants on the officers' homes and businesses, noted that 
millions of dollars have been confiscated by the narcotics teams and outlined a 
problem more sweeping than investigators or sheriff's officials had ever 
publicly acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Ten officers, including all nine members of one of the sheriff's major 
narcotics teams, have been indicted for allegedly stealing more than $1.4 
million from suspected drug traffickers and money launderers over the last two 
years alone. 
</P>
<P>
But in one case cited in the affidavits unsealed Wednesday, members of another 
narcotics squad reportedly bragged that they had "scored big" during a 1988 
drug raid and stole several hundred thousand dollars. A week later, members of 
the crew took a trip to Mexico together, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, the primary source for that information was former 
Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, one of the indicted officers and the head of 
the drug squad that was indicted two weeks ago. While the nine other officers 
pleaded not guilty, Sobel entered a guilty plea last week to conspiracy and 
filing a false income tax return and agreed to testify against his one-time 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, who resigned from the Sheriff's Department this week, was prominently 
mentioned in the federal documents as a key source for some of the information 
obtained by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
In one affidavit, FBI Special Agent Robert H. Hightower said Sobel told him 
that every money-seizure case involving the three major narcotics teams "in the 
last few years would be highly suspect." He said that Sobel also had been told 
by one narcotics officer from another team that "dissension" had developed 
among deputies because some members were taking larger shares of the stolen 
money. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, Sobel began cooperating with the government shortly 
after he was suspended last September along with eight fellow officers. At one 
point, he even met with some of his former deputies and reported on their 
conversations to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the former sergeant as having received at least $125,000 in stolen 
drug money during the last two years, Hightower added that much of Sobel's 
information was corroborated by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"Currency-skimming has become a practice, not a rarity, in those years," 
Hightower noted in his affidavit, "and has increased in the past two years as 
the seizures themselves have increased." 
</P>
<P>
Citing Sobel's statements, along with other information gathered by 
investigators, Hightower concluded that members of the three sheriff's teams 
"and their close associates share in or at least know about the fact that 
currency is being stolen during these narcotics raids" and that they also were 
engaged in laundering the money to avoid detection. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors would not comment on the affidavits, but Undersheriff 
Robert Edmonds said the alleged involvement of other major narcotics squads in 
the money-skimming scandal led to the department's decision to disband the 
teams last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a glimpse at why we took that action," Edmonds said, adding that 
additional suspensions may be a possibility as the investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 10 indicted officers, eight others have been suspended in 
the probe. The wife of one indicted deputy also was named in the grand jury 
indictment that contained 27 counts of conspiracy, theft, money laundering, 
filing false income tax returns and other criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury indictment also claims the officers spent hundreds of thousands 
of dollars stolen from drug suspects on such lavish gifts as cars, boats, 
jewelry, furniture and vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Sobel, all have maintained their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, the investigation into the money-skimming scandal 
began on Oct. 28, 1988, when an anonymous letter was sent to Sheriff Sherman 
Block and other top officials. The letter, purportedly written by the wife of a 
narcotics officer, alleged that her husband and his fellow crew members were 
stealing drug money and living "well beyond their means." 
</P>
<P>
When the letter was traced to a photocopy machine in the same center that 
houses the narcotics officers, investigators suspected that another officer had 
sent the letter. The following March, a deputy whose two sisters had previously 
been married to deputies working on major drug teams claimed that such squad 
members had been stealing money and property during raids since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Another deputy, who refused to give his name but said he was recruited for a 
narcotics team job, told a sheriff's investigator that the narcotics officers 
even used a profile in determining whether or not to steal money during a drug 
raid, one affidavit said. "These thefts generally involved raids of South 
American or Latin American individuals who had little or no narcotics but large 
amounts of currency," the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
Another retired narcotics deputy allegedly told a top sheriff's official that 
members of the narcotics bureau had invested money in a restaurant business 
that investigators contend required a net worth of at least $1 million and net 
assets of $600,000. When asked where such large sums were coming from, the 
retiree balked at answering, the affidavit said.

POLAND TO BE INVITED TO GERMAN BORDER TALKS 
</P>

The first meeting of the two Germanys and the four victorious World War II 
powers on the subject of German unity was held here Wednesday, and the 
participants agreed to invite Poland to attend sessions at which the 
Polish-German border issue is discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the host West German delegation, diplomat Dieter Kastrup, said that 
at this first meeting, the Germanys, the United States, the Soviet Union, 
Britain and France discussed procedural questions and an agenda for further 
meetings. The meeting lasted seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
He said the participants had agreed not to spell out the details of their 
meetings, the next of which will be held in East Berlin after the East German 
national election Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But Kastrup did reveal that Poland, whose government had expressed anger at 
being left out of the talks, will be permitted to attend any sessions concerned 
with the controversial border question. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
"The participants agreed Poland will be invited as soon as questions are 
discussed . . . that especially affect its borders," Kastrup said. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki wants firm guarantees that 
Poland's postwar frontier with East Germany, incorporating vast tracts of 
prewar Germany, will remain undisturbed. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
earned himself widespread international criticism by seeming to hedge on making 
such a pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure of world opinion, Kohl reversed himself last week, and his 
government offered a resolution in the Bundestag, or Parliament, making the 
pledge. But the Poles were not satisfied with promises. They want negotiations 
on the border issue to begin before the two Germanys are reunited. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called two-plus-four talks on reunification, agreed to by the Western 
allies and the Soviet Union, are designed to resolve the terms of a reunified 
Germany, as well as its future place in the European security system and such 
matters as the final status of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The four victorious nations have residual rights in Germany and over Berlin 
because no peace treaty was signed to formally end World War II. The division 
of postwar Germany into eastern and western zones of occupation by the victors, 
followed by the formation of separate states as the Cold War quickly hardened 
the East-West dividing line, foreclosed the possibility of a final peace 
settlement for the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The process was set forth during a meeting of foreign ministers in Ottawa last 
month. The two Germanys first are to forge a preliminary accord on steps toward 
unity, dealing with internal and domestic issues, and the four powers would 
then deal with the security and foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
The two Germanys held their first meeting on unification last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's talks were at the mid-diplomatic level, with the United States 
represented by State Department counselor Robert Zoellick, Assistant Secretary 
for European Affairs Raymond Seitz and National Security Council official 
Condolenza Rice. 
</P>
<P>
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Wednesday before the 
meeting that West Germany's goal at the talks is "that the foreign aspects of 
the establishment of German unity be dealt with in harmony with the European 
unification process and European security." 
</P>
<P>
The German unity question will probably be taken up informally at a higher 
level when the foreign ministers of all six countries -- except East Germany -- 
are scheduled to attend independence ceremonies for Namibia on March 21 in 
Windhoek. 
</P>
<P>
A chief sticking point in the discussions is expected to be whether a united 
Germany should be neutral or remain within the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and the three Western allies want a united Germany to remain a staunch 
member of the alliance, but Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has insisted 
that a united Germany remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Poland, however, believes that a united Germany within NATO poses less of a 
risk to East European countries than a strong, united Germany that is not 
anchored to the Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The East German position will be unclear until after the results of Sunday's 
election are known and a new government formed.

E. GERMANY'S COMMUNISTS TRY HIP CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gregor Gysi -- bespectacled lawyer, respected reformist, underdog candidate -- 
was ready to entertain voters by parachuting into a meadow recently when the 
unthinkable happened. 
</P>
<P>
A virtual hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mother Nature, it seemed, was unwilling to cut the Communists a little 
slack. 
</P>
<P>
With East Germany's first free elections just three days away, the reincarnated 
party is striving to overcome a corrupt past, forge a credible future and prove 
to a skeptical public that it's never too late to be hip. 
</P>
<P>
The startling make-over includes not only a new name, the Party of Democratic 
Socialism, but also campaign slogans in English slang, rock 'n' roll rallies, 
longhaired volunteers in Volkswagen buses and guest appearances by Lulu the 
Communist clown. 
</P>
<P>
There was even talk at one point of making a television spot with Gysi, the 
party chairman, clad in black leather while racing a motorcycle into the future 
to the beat of "Born to Be Wild." Although that idea was scotched, he did 
eventually make the parachute jump. 
</P>
<P>
A campaign slogan sums up the new style: "Better Red than Colorless." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't sit down and plan this as a strategy or anything," insists party 
spokeswoman Helga Adler. "It just happened. That's just how we are now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a young, fresh, new people. And now it's OK to have fun, to be 
preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
But even on the calmest days of the new German spring, the Communists are still 
being blown away. 
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest last fall of Erich Honecker, the former party chairman, and 
most of his top lieutenants on corruption charges, Communist membership has 
plummeted from 2.3 million East Germans to about 700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls give the Party of Democratic Socialism anywhere from 5% to 17% of 
the public's support -- enough to win only one or two seats in the 400-seat 
Volkskammer, or Parliament, being elected Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Communists are now vigorously campaigning to become exactly 
what they silenced for the past 40 years: the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is inescapable, especially in East Berlin, where the party's slick 
posters are plastered across the still-unchipped eastern face of the Berlin 
Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Films banned by the old regime as politically unacceptable are now shown for 
free in the old party's Central Committee headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"Forbidden films in the forbidden house!" the party program announces, a 
not-so-subtle reminder of the days when even party members needed VIP 
invitations to visit the Central Committee chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The main lobby is filled with campaign posters and literature, including the 
popular "Don't Worry, Take Gysi" buttons. Receptionists still address each 
other as "comrade." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Socialists' platform promises such benefits as more bicycle 
paths, cleaner water, zero unemployment and fewer spies. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you dismantle the secret police here just so you can be watched over by 
West Germany's intelligence agency?" demands one poster, underscoring the 
Democratic Socialists' call for slower reunification. 
</P>
<P>
On the ballot, the party finds itself alphabetically listed as the 19th of 24 
parties and alliances. That's eight unceremonious spots lower than a party 
called the German Beer Drinkers' Union. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of communism with razzmatazz is alienating some older party members, 
Adler admits. "There are some who are shocked and keep saying that's not the 
way we do things. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to be patient with them. A lot of them can't stand seeing party leaders 
with long hair or headbands," she said. "But what's left of our membership is a 
lot of young, highly intelligent, creative people, many of them anti-fascists 
and feminists and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be the smallest, most critical voice in the old party," Adler 
added, referring to the liberals. "No one ever listened, and no one ever 
dreamed these same people would one day have the leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Gysi is clearly the star of the Communists' traveling medicine show. The 
42-year-old, divorced Berliner won respect as a reformist when, as head of the 
Bar Assn., he fought to legalize the country's first opposition group, New 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Gysi went on to head the internal investigation of party wrongdoing and later 
became its youngest chairman in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
His snappy style and quick humor belie the stereotype of grim party loyalists. 
On the campaign trail, he jokes with hecklers who accuse him of being 
amicrophone like a stand-up comic and to field questions. 
</P>
<P>
When a questioner asked recenhe right to vote in district elections, Gysi 
explained that ited to improve the government's image. 
</P>
<P>
"But then, we could afford ty elections anyway," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all the party can hope fe," Gysi told supporters Tuesday on a campaign 
swing to Ks from East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Over and over, Gysi stressed y hopes to participate in the country's fledgling 
democracy, not to dominate it. 
</P>
<P>
He draws good crowds. At a technical school, students in the packed auditorium 
sat at his feet on the stage, and some curious passers-by even climbed in open 
windows to listen. 
</P>
<P>
But Gysi's relatively warm reception stops short of spelling any remarkable 
Communist comeback, and it pales dramatically in contrast to the cheering 
crowds drawn by visiting West German politicians such as Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, campaigning the same day and an hour's drive away from Gysi, attracted 
more than 20 times the people as he stumped for the East German alliance of his 
Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
En route to Karl-Marx-Stadt, the small Gysi caravan pulled off the autobahn at 
a rest stop only to find a Christian Democrat poster, with a picture of Kohl, 
glued to the picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the lead van in the motorcade was pulled over at a speed trap and cited 
for going 113 kilometers per hour in a 100-k.p.h. zone, or about 8 miles per 
hour over the 62-m.p.h. limit. The same police agency that once would have 
grandly escorted the party chairman to his next appearance instead slapped his 
people with a small fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the police were sympathetic to the PDS," the van's driver later 
confided. "Really, we got off cheap."

NORTH WILTS UNDER TOUGH QUESTIONS ON LIES TO CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The starched military bearing of witness Oliver L. North wilted for a telling 
moment under relentless questioning Wednesday as he acknowledged his lies to 
Congress and stated he had already demonstrated his remorse to the world. 
</P>
<P>
On his fourth and final day as a reluctant witness in the Iran-Contra trial of 
former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, North faced a barrage of 
sharp and unfriendly questions from both special prosecutor Dan K. Webb and 
defense attorney Richard W. Beckler. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution clearly wanted to closely link Poindexter with North, who was 
convicted last year of destroying documents and lying to Congress. The defense 
obviously wanted to separate the two in the minds of the jury. Both strategies 
ensured rough questioning for North. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic confrontation centered on North's meeting with 11 members of 
the House Intelligence Committee in the White House Situation Room on Aug. 6, 
1986. In that meeting, North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel on the staff of 
the National Security Council, falsely denied that he was involved in arming 
and aiding the Contras fighting in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, had dealt softly with North on earlier 
days in the trial. But his manner changed when he demanded to know whether 
North knew he had committed a crime by lying to the congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
"No," North replied, "I was not under oath. I have never lied under oath. It 
was an informal, off-the-record session." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you think it was a tea party in the White House Situation Room?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, counsel, I knew that it was not a tea party." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be flippant," Webb persisted, "but did you not know that it 
was an important and solemn occasion?" 
</P>
<P>
"I did not attach any particular solemnity to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
Webb asked if Poindexter had reassured North that he could "handle" talking to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Or take care of it," North corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"And you did?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir." 
</P>
<P>
"And you lied?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I have admitted that." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you expect him to be happy?" asked Webb in scathing tones. "You carried 
the admiral's water and lied to Congress. Did you feel good about that?" 
</P>
<P>
North, who had sat stiffly tall in the witness chair for most of the four days, 
replying with a touch of contempt to unfriendly questions and often insisting 
he could not remember anything that had happened, tried to speak but could not 
be heard. The judge asked him to speak louder. 
</P>
<P>
North leaned forward, then after many seconds moved back, then said softly: "I 
have told the whole world I did not feel good about that." 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter is charged with five counts involving a conspiracy to destroy 
documents, obstruct investigations and lie to Congress. Defense attorney 
Beckler, in his cross-examination of the witness, asked North if he had ever 
conspired with Poindexter to withhold information from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"If conspire means to violate the law," North replied, "I didn't do it." He 
then elaborated, "I have never considered, nor do I now consider, anything I 
have done as a crime." 
</P>
<P>
Beckler interrupted him. "Col. North, you're not on trial here," he said. "You 
don't have to give me a whole justification." 
</P>
<P>
But some of Beckler's questioning, like that of prosecutor Webb, made it seem 
as if North really were on trial. At one point, North said that he could not 
recall whether he had sent a message to Poindexter informing him that he had 
destroyed embarrassing documents. Beckler turned on him sarcastically: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just asking if you ever sat down at your machine and sent him a note, 
saying, 'I'm sitting down in my office, it's 3:30 in the morning, and I'm 
busily destroying documents.' You did not send that, did you?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, sir," North said. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, North said he could not reply to questions because he could no 
longer recall details and events of the Iran-Contra affair. His failure to 
remember what happened during his final weekend at the White House exasperated 
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't that weekend stick out in your mind since it resulted in your firing?" 
asked the judge. "Wasn't that an unusual weekend in your career?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it was, your honor, but I don't recall it in any degree of clarity," 
North replied. 
</P>
<P>
After North stepped down from the witness box, his former secretary, Fawn Hall, 
repeated well-known stories of how she helped her boss alter, shred and carry 
away embarrassing government documents from their office in the Executive 
Office Building. But she testified she did not know whether Poindexter knew 
anything about what she and North were doing with the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to explain why she took some documents and hid them in her boots and the 
back side of her clothing after North was fired on Nov. 25, she said: "I'm 
extremely emotional. I couldn't understand why a man who had worked for his 
country for so long was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I was crying at my desk. . . . My intention was to protect national security 
secrets, which was completely useless at that point, as we can now see."

HOME INSURANCE PRICES CAN VARY WILDLY, SURVEY BY STATE FINDS; 
</P>
<P>
RATES: SOME COMPANIES MIGHT CHARGE TWICE AS MUCH AS OTHERS FOR SIMILAR 
COVERAGE. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS GENERALLY HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN NORTHERN 
CALIFORNIANS. 
</P>

<P>
A new state Department of Insurance survey of comparative pricing for 
California homeowner coverage demonstrates, once again, that if consumers shop 
around for insurance, it can pay off substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Within the same ZIP codes, for basically the same amount of coverage, prices 
can easily vary more than 100% among companies, although some of the price 
differences may be accounted for by special discounts or credits individual 
companies have for particular customers and situations. 
</P>
<P>
There also are considerable differences in price by geographic area, with 
coverage in Sacramento and other Northern California cities usually running 
less than the same coverage in the metropolitan areas of Southern California. 
But these differences are not nearly as great as in auto insurance, where 
premiums may be three or four times as high in the Southland as in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, releasing the exhaustive statewide 
survey this week, said her department had surveyed 119 companies and was 
providing pricing charts for a selected 30 of them, representing about 80% of 
all the homeowners insurance sold in the state. Space limitations required a 
further narrowing of the range of companies and ZIP codes shown in the charts 
accompanying this article. 
</P>
<P>
The examples provided by the Insurance Department are representative samples, 
but it is unlikely that a policyholder's situation will conform precisely to 
any one of them. In short, the prices listed in the survey are more 
illustrative of prevailing patterns in certain areas than a guide to exact 
amounts that consumers may pay. 
</P>
<P>
Khalid Al-Faris, chief of the Insurance Department's Statistical Analysis 
Bureau, said a new comparative pricing survey for auto insurance will be 
released next month. 
</P>
<P>
But Gillespie's department has not yet complied with a provision of Proposition 
103 that mandates: "Upon request, and for a reasonable fee to cover costs, the 
commissioner shall provide consumers with a comparison of the rate in effect 
for each personal line of insurance for every insurer." 
</P>
<P>
Al-Faris said the department is working on this, and plans to provide, 
beginning in early 1991, such information through a 900 toll-telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when this starts, for a reasonable fee any consumer desiring to 
buy an auto, homeowner or other personal policy will be able to call the 
Insurance Department, give information about his or her situation, and receive 
quotes citing the range of prices from companies offering insurance in his or 
her area. 
</P>
<P>
This system will be much more precise, extensive and immediately usable than 
the periodic surveys the department has released in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Faris said the department also wishes to caution buyers of homeowners 
policies that the value of the policy should be pegged to the replacement value 
of the dwelling or contents in question, and not include the land value. A home 
that would sell for $250,000 might cost only about half that to replace, and 
the Insurance Department advises consumers not to buy $250,000 insurance on it. 
</P>
<P>
One weakness revealed in the past about surveys such as the one released this 
week is that they do not attempt to ascertain how available the various 
companies' policies might be in the specific ZIP codes listed. 
</P>
<P>
Because of varying underwriting standards, companies are often far more willing 
to sell in some areas than others. In some areas, companies may list prices for 
Insurance Department surveys but do not have agents available and may even 
refuse all but the least-risky business. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement accompanying the survey, Gillespie noted that it assumes "that 
the lowest applicable fire protection class applies, which means all the risks 
are located within a reasonable distance to a responding firefighting unit." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of such a unit would mean a sharply higher price, an illustration of 
how the figures should be viewed with caution. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by the CalPirg consumers research organization three years ago also 
showed that shopping around for insurance, as Gillespie and her aides 
recommend, is not necessarily easy. The survey indicated that companies or 
agents may be unresponsive on the phone and, when they do respond, may give 
inaccurate quotes. Calls to different agents often elicited sharply different 
price quotes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOMEOWNER INSURANCE RATES COMPARED 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Insurance surveyed insurance companies selling 
homeowners coverage and the 12 companies shown in these charts are a 
representative sample of their comparative premiums in various areas. Four 
rating examples are shown here, labeled A through D, and covering policies for 
two differently valued houses, as well as a condominium policy and a tenant 
policy. Features of the various company policies vary in some particulars, but 
in general coverage includes loss for fire and theft, injuries to individuals 
and damage to contents. In homeowners policies, properties are seldom covered 
for their full value, since a substantial portion of that value is the land on 
which they are built. Generally, coverage is for the replacement value of the 
dweller. It is assumed that the land will still be there, even if the dwelling 
is destroyed. The policies cited here do not include earthquake coverage.

Insurance rates -- A chart Thursday on comparative homeowner insurance rates 
contained misleading information about premiums charged by Farmers insurance 
companies. Rates cited in the chart were for Farmers' standard company, whose 
premiums are far higher than those offered by its "preferred" subsidiary, Fire 
Insurance Exchange, which writes the vast majority of Farmers homeowner 
policies. Most other insurers listed in the chart also were lower-priced, 
preferred companies. Here is a sampling of Fire Insurance Exchange's annual 
rates for a $250,000 homeowners policy on a 1984 home in selected Southern 
California cities: $1,114 in Los Angeles, $848 in Riverside, $812 in Long 
Beach, $754 in San Diego, $705 in Anaheim and $532 in Santa Barbara. The rates 
are those offered in a selected ZIP code of each city.

GIANT FROGS CAN JUMP IF THE PAD FITS

For once, a breed of Goliaths has triumphed -- but only if they're small enough 
to fit onto an eight-inch launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
After months of controversy, organizers of Calaveras County's famed Frog 
Jumping Jubilee voted Wednesday night to allow giant African Goliath frogs to 
compete in the whimsical contest. 
</P>
<P>
The debate at the meeting of the 39th Agricultural District Assn., which runs 
the contest as part of the Calaveras County Fair in May, included a report from 
two local residents who recently visited the frogs' habitat in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The association's decision included one qualifier: The Goliath frogs must jump 
off the same eight-inch circular pads that their smaller California bullfrog 
competitors use. Any frog that cannot get all four feet on the pad before the 
jump will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they can fit their feet on the pad, they can compete," said Ruth 
Kuhl, one of nine members of the association's board of directors. "I'm not 
sure (the Goliaths) can, but those are the rules and any frog who obeys the 
rules should be able to compete." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview before the meeting, Seattle animal importer Andy J. 
Koffman said he would not fight the restrictions. His frogs, some of which 
stretch three feet, have already begun practicing on eight-inch launching pads, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with these rules, but if that's the best I can do, then so be 
it," Koffman said. 
</P>
<P>
The "frog crisis" began in January, when Koffman announced that he planned to 
enter 10 of his "superfrogs" in the 62-year-old contest, which was inspired by 
Mark Twain's short story, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County." 
</P>
<P>
Koffman's Goliaths are four to eight times larger than California bullfrogs, 
which weigh an average of one pound. 
</P>
<P>
Some Calaveras County residents were hopping mad at Koffman and fair organizers 
threatened to bar the frogs from the contest. 
</P>
<P>
State officials also leaped into the fray, saying they would deny Koffman's 
amphibians a permit to enter California. The officials said they feared that 
the Goliaths, should they escape into the wild, would terrorize the local 
insect and fish populations. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, the officials said they will no longer block the Goliaths from 
coming to California. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look like that species would survive even if they got loose," said 
Lanny Clavecilla of the state Department of Fish and Game in Sacramento. He 
said his office and state Department of Food and Agriculture were planning to 
issue a joint permit Friday that would allow the frogs into the state. 
</P>
<P>
Koffman claims the Goliaths can jump 30 to 40 feet in one bound and says he is 
confident his frogs can easily exceed the contest record of 21 feet, 5 3/4 
inches set by Rosie the Ribbiter's three leaps in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
If Koffman is right, he can claim $1,000 for breaking the record, as well as 
$500 for winning this year's contest. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists, including UC Berkeley biology professor David Wake, are 
skeptical. He said the world record for frog jumping is 32 feet, 3 inches for 
three leaps, set in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1954 by a cousin of the 
Goliaths, a frog species known as Rana oxyrhynchus.

U.S. RIGHT TO CUT SUBSIDY ON WATER IS UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: THE DECISION IS CONSIDERED A SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO LARGE CORPORATE 
FARMS AND CENTRAL VALLEY WATER DISTRICTS. 
</P>

<P>
In a significant blow to large corporate farms and Central Valley water 
districts, a federal appeals court Wednesday upheld the government's right to 
reduce huge water subsidies to large farms under the Water Reclamation Reform 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous opinion, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld revisions 
of the 1902 Reclamation Act that Congress enacted in 1982 providing that 
farmers could get federally subsidized water to irrigate up to 960 acres of 
land. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms also provided that water districts and their customers would have 
to pay the full cost of such water on any acreage above the 960-acre limit. 
</P>
<P>
One of the stated goals of the original law was to help small farmers by 
limiting subsidized water to 160-acre parcels. But large corporate farms got 
around the limit by claiming that huge amounts of their acreage were leased. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 amendments were designed to close long-standing loopholes that for 
decades benefited large Western corporate farmers such as J. G. Boswell Co. and 
Southern Pacific Land Co. They got water subsidies even though they controlled 
land far in excess of the law's original 160-acre limit. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's opinion, Appeals Court Judge William Norris said the intent of 
Congress in revising the act was to promote small farming operations, equitable 
distribution of water and water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"To these ends, Congress increased the size of farms that could receive 
reclamation water to 960 acres (whether leased or owned) and raised the price 
of reclamation water to reflect more accurately its true cost to the 
government," Norris continued. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the major decisions on federal water policy," said Hal Candee, 
a San Francisco lawyer who works for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental advocacy group that urged the appeals court to uphold the law. 
</P>
<P>
Candee said the decision will have a positive impact on San Francisco Bay by 
reducing diversion of water to farming operations that otherwise would go to 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Rivett of the Sacramento-based Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative 
public interest law group which represented some of the water districts, said 
he was disappointed by the decision and expected that his clients will pursue 
an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. He said the decision will make farming 
more expensive in 17 Western states and lead to increased food prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Farming arrangements will be drastically changed in the West," said Stuart 
Somach, a Sacramento lawyer who represents the Central Valley Water Project 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decision upheld a 1988 ruling by U.S. District Judge Raul Ramirez 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The specific section of the 1982 law that was challenged by the big farm owners 
and water districts has come to be known as "the hammer clause." It compels 
water districts to make a choice: They can amend existing contracts to conform 
to the 960-acre limitation or they can provide water to lands in excess of 160 
acres provided that they pay the government's full cost of delivering the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The court rejected the arguments of several water districts that the reforms 
interfered with their contractual right to receive subsidized water from 
federal reclamation projects for distribution to agricultural users in their 
districts. The court ruled that the reforms did not violate the due process 
rights of the water districts, nor did the reforms constitute an improper 
taking of property under the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The value of subsidized water to large farms is immense. The Congressional 
Budget Office, in a recent study, estimated that the federal government will 
spend roughly $3.8 billion over the next five years on Bureau of Reclamation 
water projects but will recover only $275 million under current reclamation 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Subsidies to the large farms in the Central Valley, particularly in Fresno's 
Westlands Water District, have long been controversial. Congress began 
subsidizing water in 1902 when it appropriated funds for two mammoth, 
federal-owned projects to build and operate canals, dams and reservoirs in the 
Central Valley to provide water for rapidly growing populations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Candee, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that despite Wednesday's 
decision the battle over subsidized water is far from over. He asserted that 
large corporate farm interests had created other "subterfuges" to get around 
the 1982 reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Candee said, large farmers were using land trusts and management 
agreements in an attempt to illegally obtain subsidized water. The council sued 
the Bureau of Reclamation for failing to properly enforce the law by permitting 
large owners to get subsidized water through these devices. 
</P>
<P>
Somach, the Sacramento lawyer, said the suit was baseless. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is now pending in federal district court in Sacramento.

VAN DE KAMP REQUESTS TESTS OF ABORTION PILL; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: ATTORNEY GENERAL ASKS STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO OVERSEE STUDY OF 
DRUG, WHICH IS NOT APPROVED IN U.S. BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE 
MANUFACTURER WILL SUPPLY IT.

California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp called on the state health department 
Wednesday to allow testing of the abortion pill RU 486 by researchers or drug 
companies interested in distributing the drug within the state. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, called 
for testing of RU 486 under a 2-year-old program in which the health department 
has been overseeing the testing of experimental AIDS drugs without the usual 
federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no guarantee that the drug's manufacturer, the French firm Roussel 
Uclaf, will supply it, Van de Kamp acknowledged at a news conference in Los 
Angeles. Faced with the threat of a boycott by abortion opponents, drug 
companies have been unwilling so far to introduce RU 486 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no guarantees, we have no definite assurances," Van de Kamp said, 
referring to his communications with the manufacturer, conducted through an 
intermediary. He said the company had offered only "an expression of real 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the announcement ranged from praise to charges of political 
opportunism. 
</P>
<P>
Several researchers interested in seeing the drug tested and perhaps approved 
for distribution in the United States called Van de Kamp's move an encouraging 
step that might prod not only the manufacturer but the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the right to abortion called it "smart politics" and good news for 
American women. Dianne Feinstein, Van de Kamp's opponent for the Democratic 
nomination, suggested that the attorney general was "trying to one-up me with 
the female vote." 
</P>
<P>
An opponent of abortion criticized the plan. "I see it as a desperate political 
maneuver to out-pro-abort two other pro-abortion candidates for governor," said 
Jan Carroll of National Right to Life, referring to Feinstein and Republican 
Pete Wilson. "But mainly I feel it's . . . an attempt to use the women of 
California as guinea pigs." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein leads Van de Kamp among women voters by more than 2 to 1, according 
to a recent Los Angeles Times Poll. She is the first serious woman candidate 
for governor in California history, and women make up 60% of the vote in the 
California Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Although Van de Kamp, who is Catholic, is personally opposed to abortion, he 
has sought for more than a year to present himself as the strongest proponent 
of the right to abortion in the governor's race. On Wednesday, he denied that 
his proposal was political. 
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with running for governor," he said. "When you run for 
governor, you do not stop engaging in public policy." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Van de Kamp announced that he was sending a letter to Dr. 
Kenneth Kizer, director of the Department of Health Services, urging him to use 
the state's so-called mini-FDA to encourage and expedite testing of RU 486. 
</P>
<P>
The department's drug bureau received funding in 1987 to approve and oversee 
testing of experimental AIDS drugs. By law, it can approve AIDS drugs for sale 
in California, but they must be manufactured and distributed solely in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp urged Kizer "to use the same statutory process for the testing of 
RU 486, in the event that any qualified investigator or California company 
applies, and to . . . announce that the state will expedite the review process 
to the maximum extent medically appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Kizer declined to comment, saying he needed time to study the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marcus A. Conant, a professor at UC San Francisco, is working with other 
physicians preparing a proposal to submit to the health department under Van de 
Kamp's plan. Conant said Van de Kamp's step is important in setting in motion a 
process that could lead to distribution of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Conant said his group intends within two months to submit to the state a 
proposal to test RU 486 in California. The study would compare the reliability 
and side effects of RU 486 to those of surgical abortion in approximately 200 
women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conant expressed optimism that the study would be approved. The study could 
lead eventually to approval of the drug. Physicians could then appeal to the 
manufacturer for supplies, or to the World Health Organization, which also may 
distribute the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can get the process moving, and begin a public discussion, and empower 
people (as to) what they can and can't do, the system seems to move along," 
said Conant, who is also co-chairman of the California AIDS Leadership 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But E. C. Norton, manager of communications for Hoechst Celanese Corp. in New 
Jersey, a sister company of Roussel Uclaf, said he knew of no plans by the 
companies to introduce the drug in the United States and no requests by other 
firms for license to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion pill, which can be taken up to five weeks after conception, is 
viewed as a revolutionary step in fertility control. It promises a safer, 
easier and more private abortion than the traditional surgical approach, 
advocates as well as critics acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, researchers released the results of the largest study of the drug to 
date. The study reported a 96% success rate among 2,115 women in France who 
were given the drug. The side effects, such as pain and bleeding, were no worse 
than in conventional abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Also last week, delegates to the California Medical Assn.'s annual meeting 
voted unanimously to approve medical use of the pill. The association agreed to 
urge the American Medical Assn. at its upcoming annual meeting to voice its 
support for the pill.

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
RU 486, the revolutionary abortion pill developed in France, has been shown to 
be 96% effective when taken early in pregnancy. It is available in France and 
China, and is being considered for marketing in Great Britain, Scandinavia and 
the Netherlands. But neither its French manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, nor any 
other pharmaceutical firm has applied for permission to market RU 486 in the 
United States. Their reluctance has been traced largely to fear of a boycott of 
their products by opponents of abortion.

EAST GERMANY: THE KOHL-BACKED LEADER ADMITS THE CHARGES. A CROWD AT A CAMPAIGN 
RALLY IS STUNNED BY THE NEWS.

<P>
An election rally of about 200,000 East Germans here was stunned Wednesday with 
news that one of their leaders had worked for the Communist secret police. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, which had gathered in a buoyant mood to hear West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl deliver a rousing speech in this, the cradle for East Germany's 
revolution, was instead told by a preliminary speaker that Wolfgang Schnur, 
head of one of the three parties in the Kohl-backed Alliance of Germany, had 
resigned after admitting links with the security apparatus, known as the Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
Schnur, who has been confined to a sick bed in recent days, had previously 
denied a series of accusations claiming he had worked as an informant for the 
hated Stasi, as well as passing information to West German intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell you a very sad and serious thing," Oswald Wutzke, general 
secretary of Schnur's party, Democratic Awakening, told the crowd. "Wolfgang 
Schnur has resigned from his position because he has admitted that part of the 
allegations against him are true. 
</P>
<P>
"Wolfgang Schnur has unfortunately done the same thing as God knows how many 
other East German citizens," Wutzke added. "It just proves how bad things 
were." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl did not refer to Schnur during his address. But he told a news conference 
just before the rally that it was neither correct nor possible to withhold what 
he termed "such serious information" just before a national election, which is 
scheduled for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He expressed solidarity with the Democratic Awakening party. 
</P>
<P>
Schnur, a lawyer from the northern port of Rostock, defended well-known 
opponents of the former neo-Stalinist East German regime and was widely viewed 
as a man of personal courage. 
</P>
<P>
Many innocent East Germans were blackmailed into informing on fellow citizens 
during the Communist era. 
</P>
<P>
How the affair will affect the moderate right-wing alliance is unclear. In 
interviews after the rally, several citizens admitted they were shocked by the 
announcement but said they will still vote for one of the alliance parties. 
</P>
<P>
"This election isn't about personalities, it's about unification," stated 
Werner Schramm, a locksmith. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement took the edge off what was to have been a triumphant farewell 
appearance for Kohl on the East German campaign trail. The crowd's original 
upbeat mood reflected a strong surge by the Alliance for Germany in the final 
days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Local residents and city officials described the crowd as both larger and more 
spirited than at a Social Democratic Party rally last month at which former 
West German Chancellor Willy Brandt spoke. 
</P>
<P>
While early opinion polls had indicated a commanding lead for the Social 
Democrats, more recent surveys have shown the Alliance for Germany roughly 
even, with a sizable minority still undecided.

<P>
The military government of Sudan has imprisoned and tortured hundreds of 
opposition figures, hanged prisoners after brief show trials, and used live 
ammunition on demonstrators in pursuing an "exceptionally cruel and intolerant" 
policy of repression, an international human-rights group has charged. 
</P>
<P>
The report by London-based Africa Watch supports increasing indications that 
the military government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, which seized 
power last June 30, is perhaps the most brutal to have afflicted Sudan in its 
34 years of independence. 
</P>
<P>
"In a mere nine months since its seizure of power," the report states, "the 
Revolutionary Command Council has . . . embarked upon a systematic and brutal 
repression of political opposition in Khartoum which already surpasses even the 
worst excesses perpetrated by Numeiri." 
</P>
<P>
Jaafar Numeiri was the Sudanese dictator overthrown in a popular revolution in 
1985, amid increasing famine, war and an attempt to impose a fundamentalist 
Islamic state on this heterogeneous country. 
</P>
<P>
The Africa Watch report comes as the government's international friends are 
rapidly dropping away. At the end of February, the United States, which had 
been an ally of the previous democratically elected government, cut off an 
estimated $60 million in aid. The reason was that federal law prohibits 
continuing aid to unelected governments that overthrow democratic regimes 
without establishing a timetable for new elections. 
</P>
<P>
Several other major international donors to Sudan, including Britain, the 
Netherlands, France and West Germany, have also scaled back their aid programs. 
Among the Bashir regime's few remaining friends is Libya, which is said to have 
stepped up its sale of petroleum to the regime. After returning to Khartoum 
from a recent visit to Libya, Bashir announced new plans for a Libyan-Sudan 
federation to be formed over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, possibly in response to growing international criticism, the 
Bashir regime has announced the freeing of 21 trade unionists held in prison 
for as long as nine months. The government also said it would shortly release 
all other political prisoners except those charged with corruption, a caveat 
that Africa Watch charged is so broad that it could cover most prisoners 
otherwise considered political detainees. 
</P>
<P>
The government also said that long-delayed visits by families, friends and 
diplomats would be permitted prisoners after the end of the Muslim holiday of 
Ramadan, or after the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
"That's so far off that we don't put any store in it," said Rakiya Omaar, 
executive director of Africa Watch. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a continuing famine in southern Sudan, caused in part by years of 
warfare in that region, has cost as many as 500,000 lives since 1986, the 
watchdog group contends. A U.N.-sponsored relief program operating from Kenya 
and Uganda was suspended after last June's coup; in recent statements, the 
government has said it might resume in April. 
</P>
<P>
The new military government arrested about 300 leading Sudanese politicians 
almost immediately upon assuming power. These included not only Prime Minister 
Sadek Mahdi but also leaders of all major opposition parties. Many, including 
Mahdi, have since been released. 
</P>
<P>
The military rulers increased the level of repression after a series of strikes 
and protests late in November and December. After a doctor's strike Nov. 26, 
four doctors were charged with "waging war against the state," a capital 
offense, the watchdog group said. The leader of the strike was condemned to 
death, although his sentence has evidently since been commuted; but he was 
reportedly so severely beaten that he was in a coma for four days. 
</P>
<P>
Other prisoners have been physically abused or denied medical treatment, 
including insulin required by at least two diabetics in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the doctors' strike, security forces fired on a crowd of 
demonstrators at a Khartoum university, reportedly killing four. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Bashir government has broadened the application of the 
sharia, or Islamic law, to cover more offenses than were considered either by 
Numeiri or Sadek. Sharia has been the single greatest polarizing issue in 
Sudanese society since Numeiri first imposed it in 1984. Remarkable for the 
harshness of its punishments, it calls for the amputation of limbs of thieves, 
stoning to death of heretics, and flogging for a multitude of other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Sadek's refusal to rescind sharia during his administration was partly 
responsible for his inability to come to terms with the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Front, the guerrillas waging war in southern Sudan, during his 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas spurned Sadek's proposal to put the issue to a plebiscite, on 
grounds that any consideration of imposing harsh Islamic law would make the 
Christians and animists of the south second-class citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The military government's more outspoken support for sharia has stalemated any 
further talks.

TODAY IS DAWN OF DEMOCRACY FOR BRAZIL; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AMERICA: COLLOR'S INAUGURATION DRAWS FOREIGN DIGNITARIES. BUT ANY 
CELEBRATION WILL BE CLOUDED BY THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest country in Latin America completes a long transition to democracy 
today with the inauguration of Fernando Collor de Mello, 40, as the first 
popularly elected Brazilian president since a 1964 military coup. 
</P>
<P>
The event has drawn a host of foreign dignitaries to this 30-year-old inland 
capital, including President Fidel Castro of Cuba and Vice President Dan 
Quayle. The atmosphere of celebration, however, contrasts sharply with the 
reality of a national economic crisis that includes hyper-inflation of more 
than 70% a month. 
</P>
<P>
The runaway inflation will present Collor, an advocate of free-market policies, 
with his most urgent challenge as president. At his request Tuesday, outgoing 
President Jose Sarney decreed a bank holiday Wednesday through Friday to 
prevent financial speculation and confusion in anticipation of anti-inflation 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
As the foreign guests arrived Wednesday, security measures and inaugural 
preparations raised tension in this normally relaxed city. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, an advance plane for Castro's entourage caused a minor flap 
when Brazilian authorities found it loaded with tons of weapons, which the 
Cubans said were needed for security. The Brazilians sent most of the weapons 
back to Cuba, including automatic assault rifles and grenade launchers. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle was asked on arrival whether he would talk with the Cuban leader, as he 
had talked with another foe of recent U.S. administrations, Nicaragua's 
President Daniel Ortega, in Chile. "We have no desire to meet with Castro," he 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian newspapers said Wednesday that Collor's first economic measures, to 
be announced Friday, will include a major devaluation of the national currency, 
suspension of government incentives and subsidies, a 4% tax on the liquid 
assets of corporations and the replacement of an overnight money market with 
one that will require deposits to be held at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
Although Collor has said he does not want to freeze prices and wages, some 
newspapers say a temporary freeze is being planned. In anticipation of a 
freeze, some stores have marked up prices by more than 100% in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
Collor has promised to lower Brazil's inflation rate to 10% a month within 100 
days. He also has said he will sell or shut down many government-owned 
corporations, eliminate the government's inflationary deficit, crack down on 
tax evaders and open the country's economy to foreign competition and capital. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, he said the cost of the economic reform will be paid by Brazilian 
"elites" and not the country's poor majority. 
</P>
<P>
"At no moment will the price of our difficulties be paid by the workers," he 
pledged. "The problem is caused in large part by that corrupt elite that lives 
on government favors." 
</P>
<P>
To help enforce his economic policies, Collor has given federal Police Chief 
Romeu Tuma the added duties of overseeing tax collections and pricing 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In naming his Cabinet, Collor gave Brazilians a series of surprises. One of the 
most unexpected appointments came this week, when he designated Supreme Court 
Justice Francisco Rezek as his foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
Rezek, a career jurist, was president of the Supreme Electoral Council, which 
conducted presidential elections in November and December, finally certifying 
Collor's victory in the runoff. One of the losing candidates, Leonel Brizola, 
hinted that Rezek's appointment compromised the integrity of the electoral 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Collor named Zelia Cardoso de Melo, a young economist with experience only at 
lower and middle levels of government, as his powerful economy minister. 
</P>
<P>
Collor rose to national prominence as governor of Alagoas, a small state in 
Brazil's impoverished northeast. He captured media attention by waging a tough 
campaign against the "maharajas" -- overpaid public servants. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo noted Wednesday that Margarida Procopio, 
Collor's minister-designate of social action, was on a list of 273 Alagoas 
"maharajas" published by Collor in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Backed only by a tiny and recently formed party, Collor came from behind as a 
presidential candidate last year by campaigning against corruption and 
inefficiency in the Sarney administration. Sarney, a former senator who took 
office as provisional president when the armed forces left power in March, 
1985, was an unpopular and largely ineffective leader. 
</P>
<P>
His main claim to a place in history may be for ushering this nation of 150 
million people to full democracy after 29 years without popular presidential 
elections.

PANAMA'S CIVILIAN TOLL PUT TOO LOW, INVESTIGATORS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
INVASION: DOCTOR GROUP ESTIMATES 302 DIED, NOT 202. MILITARY CASUALTIES MAY 
HAVE BEEN VASTLY OVERESTIMATED.

<P>
A team of American doctors have concluded that at least 302 Panamanian 
civilians were apparently killed in the U.S invasion of Panama -- far more than 
the Pentagon has estimated -- and that Panamanian military casualties may have 
been vastly overestimated. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, issued Wednesday in a report by the independent Physicians for 
Human Rights, suggest that the Dec. 20 invasion inflicted a far greater share 
of suffering on noncombatants than U.S. officials had estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors said they have received reliable reports of more than 100 civilian 
deaths that appeared not to have been included in the announced U.S. total of 
202. At the same time, they disclosed that officials have been able to confirm 
only 50 of the 314 military deaths previously announced. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had no immediate comment on the findings, but an official said 
that the U.S. Southern Command in Panama had already concluded that its early 
estimates of Panamanian military deaths were probably too high. 
</P>
<P>
If the new medical survey has uncovered a more accurate total, a State 
Department official said, "we're not going to quibble." The official called the 
earlier U.S. account a "good-faith effort." 
</P>
<P>
In another finding, the team of doctors concluded that the number of 
Panamanians injured during the invasion exceeded the official U.S. estimate. 
</P>
<P>
While the United States put the figure at 1,508, the physicians' team reported 
that at least 3,000 Panamanians sought hospital care for injuries sustained 
during the first week after the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The indication that civilian deaths may greatly have exceeded those among the 
military cast new doubt on the Bush Administration contention that the victory 
for democracy in Panama was won at minimal cost to the nation's population. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three American soldiers died in the invasion and 324 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The investigative team concluded that the primary cause of death among 
civilians was "the official U.S. policy of using overwhelming firepower in 
residential areas to protect American lives," said Ralph Wise, a Harvard 
Medical School professor who was part of the group. 
</P>
<P>
The respected physician group, which specializes in assessing the medical 
consequences of armed conflict, said it found no indication that the United 
States sought to obscure the true casualty figures. 
</P>
<P>
It also said it found no evidence that the Panamanian death toll numbered in 
the thousands, as claimed by some private citizens in the wake of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors' report suggested that official estimates were flawed because U.S. 
officials used unconfirmed battlefield observations to estimate military 
casualties and relied on surveys of morgues and hospitals to count civilian 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
The physician team said interviews with church and hospital officials produced 
extensive evidence of civilian deaths not included on the lists assembled by 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
It noted further that the vast majority of the 314 "enemy kills" claimed by the 
United States remains unsupported by any conclusive evidence. Only 50 of those 
casualties have been positively identified by the Panamanian government as 
members of the Panama Defense Forces, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The physician group said it was likely that some of those listed as civilian 
casualties may in fact have been military personnel in civilian clothing -- a 
finding that could add to the total of military dead. But it asserted that the 
actual Panamanian military death toll nevertheless appears to have been far 
less than claimed by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Panama have long acknowledged privately that the official 
U.S. estimate of 314 Panamanian military dead appeared excessive, saying it had 
been based on exaggerated "battlefield extrapolations." 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Southern Command has never revised its assessment, with 
investigators indicating they want to be sure of their findings before 
releasing a lower figure. 
</P>
<P>
The separate finding that 202 civilians died as a result of the invasion was 
endorsed both by the United States and the new government of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The team of American doctors, however, said that estimate had ignored a 
Panamanian Red Cross report that there had been 62 non-military deaths in the 
city of Colon -- 38 more than the official count. 
</P>
<P>
They said other "reliable reports" from church leaders, hospital officials and 
family members make clear that at least 60 civilians killed in Panama City 
during the invasion and its aftermath were not included on the official list. 
</P>
<P>
The report was also critical of U.S. efforts to relieve suffering among those 
made homeless by the invasion, saying that relief efforts have been "inadequate 
to meet the basic needs of many civilians." 
</P>
<P>
It reported that the United States has taken full responsibility for the 
support of fewer than 3,000 of 18,000 displaced persons; many of the remainder 
lack adequate food and shelter, it stated. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official noted, however, that many of those civilians chose 
to live with relatives rather than move into U.S.-operated refugee centers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we wouldn't help these people," the official said. "It's that 
they didn't ask us to."

Israel's Likud and Labor parties, embittered respondents in an ugly divorce, 
blamed each other Wednesday for the break-up of the coalition government and 
prepared for today's preliminary decision on who gets the house. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, the 120 members of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, are 
scheduled to vote on a Labor-led no-confidence motion against the rump 
government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of forces appears to be razor-thin, and the decision rests with one 
or two small ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties, excluding the possibility of a 
last-minute coalition reconciliation, which Israeli political analysts say 
would take "a miracle" that neither side wants. 
</P>
<P>
If today's vote goes against Shamir, he will be left as head of a caretaker 
government, beginning a process in which both he and Labor leader Shimon Peres 
may be offered the opportunity to put together a ruling majority. If Shamir and 
his loyalists defeat the no-confidence motion, he will remain prime minister 
with a fragile majority. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's collapse of the 15-month-old coalition left bitter feelings 
throughout Israel's political family. Editorialized Yediot Aharonot, the 
country's largest newspaper: "One cannot ignore the damage this whole ugly 
affair is doing to the foundations of democracy in Israel." The paper noted 
that instead of mending fences, "everyone is drawing battle lines and making 
tough statements." 
</P>
<P>
One of the roughest came from Yigal Bibi, a member of Parliament from the 
National Religious Party, which was aligned with Likud in the now-split 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"We should vote no confidence in Shamir," Bibi told the Jerusalem Post. "He has 
no spine; he is not honest. He is an indifferent man with no trace of 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Several Likud Party members called on the prime minister to resign in order to 
strengthen his party's hand in the no-confidence vote and the political 
struggle that will follow. Shamir had rejected the suggestion late Tuesday 
after his firing of Peres as deputy prime minister and finance minister led to 
the resignation of all Labor ministers in the Cabinet and the collapse of the 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir himself led the attack on Labor on Wednesday. He blamed the break-up on 
Labor's insistence for a positive response to an American-proposed formula for 
getting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks under way. He insists the formula would 
invite Palestine Liberation Organization influence and raise questions about 
the legitimacy of Jerusalem as the indivisible and sovereign capital of Israel. 
And he took another shot at American mediation in the proposed talks, designed 
to unstick his own stalled peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Likud's caucus in Parliament, the prime minister said: "Our 
initiative (the May, 1989, peace plan) clearly intended to take the PLO out of 
the arena. But the State Department put all its energy into focusing on the 
PLO, and the Labor Party said nothing would move without the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
After years of refusal to do so, the United States began limited talks with the 
PLO after its leader, Yasser Arafat, announced in late 1988 that he accepted 
the existence of Israel and opposed the use of terrorism. Israel, however, 
refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it officially regards as an 
unrepentant terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Arab residents of Jerusalem will not participate in any form in elections for 
autonomy because this would endanger Jerusalem's status and her future as the 
capital of Israel," Shamir continued. "On this issue we will not negotiate a 
compromise. The heart of all of us and our consciences will not allow it." 
</P>
<P>
Peres, whose party agrees that Jerusalem should remain undivided and Israeli, 
would endorse participation by East Jerusalem Palestinians in electing 
representatives for peace talks. He told Israel Radio, "There won't be peace so 
long as Shamir heads this government." 
</P>
<P>
While the leaders restated their positions on peace, the fundamental issue that 
broke up the coalition, Likud and Labor politicians worked hard on the more 
immediate problem, the no-confidence vote. Top political operatives called on 
the rabbis who guide the religious parties. 
</P>
<P>
With the swing votes in their hands, the religious leaders were expected to 
base their allegiance in part on demands they have made in past 
government-building efforts here: more money for religious schools, stricter 
observance of Jewish holidays and influential posts in government to carry out 
their favored programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Knesset test of Shamir's government was assured for this morning when Labor 
attempts to hold it Wednesday were blocked. Labor supporters tried that avenue 
in a bid to keep Labor ministers in a caretaker government if Shamir loses the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers quit Tuesday, but the resignations were not effective for 48 
hours. A successful no-confidence vote on Wednesday would have left them in a 
transitional regime.

Jerusalem's Mayor Teddy Kollek said Wednesday that President Bush has written 
to him promising that the United States supports a united Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem "must never again be a divided city," Bush wrote in the March 13 
letter distributed at a news conference here. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bush made a statement apparently lumping East Jerusalem, which 
Israel regards as its sovereign territory, with the West Bank, which is under 
Israeli military occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a news conference at the Israeli Embassy whether he believed Bush's 
letter canceled the President's earlier statement, Kollek said: "That is my 
strong impression." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, however, said in his letter: "It is also our view that the final status 
of this most special of cities should be decided by negotiation. . . . There is 
thus no intention on our part to focus now on the final status of Jerusalem."

$10 BILLION MORE A YEAR URGED FOR U.S. CHILD CARE; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY: A RESEARCH COUNCIL REPORT STRESSES HELP FOR THE POOR. IT ALSO BACKS 
GIVING NEW PARENTS UP TO ONE YEAR OF UNPAID LEAVE FROM THEIR JOBS.

The National Research Council called Wednesday for an ambitious government 
effort to substantially improve the nation's child-care system, starting with 
an infusion of $5 billion to $10 billion annually in additional public funds. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-member panel recommended expanding government support to help low-income 
families attain quality care, imposing nationwide standards for child-care 
services and requiring that all new parents be allowed to take up to one year 
of unpaid leave to care for their children. 
</P>
<P>
The existing child-care system is inadequate, and services are unavailable, 
unaffordable or substandard, said the panel, part of the prestigious National 
Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
"Every American child not only deserves quality care, the future vitality of 
our nation depends on it," said John L. Palmer, dean of the Maxwell School of 
Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University and chairman of the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
The study was released as House leaders struggled to strike a compromise on 
legislation to expand federal child-care grants. The panel took no position on 
the proposed legislation, nor did it endorse specific funding mechanisms to 
support its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year study was conducted by a committee of experts from the fields of 
pediatrics, public policy, business, labor, child development and other social 
sciences. The panel was convened by the academy, a congressionally chartered 
private organization that advises the federal government on matters of science 
and technology. 
</P>
<P>
The study was requested and funded by the Department of Health and Human 
Services, the Ford Foundation and the Foundation for Child Development. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of child-care legislation immediately praised the report and called 
for quick approval of legislation to expand child-care support. 
</P>
<P>
The report "is right on the mark" and "underscores the need for action to 
provide affordable and accessible child care that meets reasonable standards of 
health and safety," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The report "confirms the importance of a federal investment in day care," said 
Helen Blank, senior child-care associate with the Children's Defense Fund, a 
children's advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), author of a Senate child-care bill, said 
the panel "has confirmed what we've known all along: that families' options are 
inadequate and that a major federal effort is needed to improve the quality, 
availability and affordability of child care in America." 
</P>
<P>
The report said that the United States has not kept pace with other industrial 
countries in responding to the sweeping social changes that have caused more 
women to enter the work force in recent years, greatly expanding the use of 
child-care services. 
</P>
<P>
After noting that most existing benefits, such as tax credits, are geared 
toward helping the middle class, the report recommended that the federal 
government, in partnership with the states, expand subsidies to low-income 
families to help them pay for quality child care. 
</P>
<P>
"For many parents in or near poverty, problems with child care can be a barrier 
to becoming and staying employed," the report said. "Therefore, child care must 
be a central component of any policy to help poor families achieve economic 
self-sufficiency through employment." 
</P>
<P>
The panel proposed expanding the government's Head Start program to serve all 
eligible 3- and 4-year-olds "who are at risk of early school failure." The Bush 
Administration has requested an increase of $500 million in the Head Start 
budget, but it would enable only 70% of eligible 4-year-olds to participate. 
</P>
<P>
In what could be its most controversial proposal, the panel called on the 
federal government to develop national standards for child-care facilities, 
asserting that "standards are important . . . and do make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, each state sets its own standards, which vary considerably. The 
pending child-care legislation includes provisions to strengthen state 
standards, but Congress has shied away from the idea of federally mandated 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The panel said that national standards should address staff-child ratios, group 
size, care-giver training and experience and physical space and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of child care that children get matters," said panel member Andrew 
Cherlin, a member of the department of sociology at Johns Hopkins University. 
"Children who get good quality care do better in life." 
</P>
<P>
The committee called on the federal government to mandate that employed parents 
of infants up to the age of 1 year should be allowed to take up to a year of 
unpaid, job-protected leave with full health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe U.S. working parents of very young children are being forced to 
make choices that they should not have to make -- choices about leaving the 
work force or leaving their children in low-quality care," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation that would require companies to grant up to 10 weeks of 
job-protected leave over two years so employees could care for a newborn or 
seriously ill child or parent has been approved by House and Senate committees 
and is awaiting floor action. 
</P>
<P>
The panel complained that the salaries received by experienced care givers were 
far too low, noting that such workers earn on average a third less than other 
women of comparable education levels. 
</P>
<P>
It said its recommendations would require spending an additional $5 billion to 
$10 billion in public funds each year, with most coming from the federal 
government. Current public expenditures on child care are about $8 billion.

FOLEY FORCES SHOWDOWN, SEEKS TO END CHILD-CARE ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) pushed hard Wednesday to end a bitter 
dispute between rival factions of House Democrats over a landmark child-care 
bill, one of the chief pieces of social legislation before Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
Foley's aides said an agreement was within reach between forces headed by Rep. 
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) that 
would avert an intraparty floor fight and open the way for House passage of the 
bill within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're close, but we're not there yet," said Rep. Thomas J. Downey (D-N.Y.), 
one of the key negotiators on Rostenkowski's team. 
</P>
<P>
The two factions are at odds over whether the final bill will create a new 
federal program to aid child-care providers or simply channel funds through an 
existing federal vehicle for financing social welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
Also at stake in the dispute is whether church-based centers, which currently 
provide about one-third of all child care, will continue to be eligible for 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the House hurdles are overcome, both sides forecast a battle to 
reconcile the bill with competing proposals favored by the Bush Administration 
and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Hawkins said the Speaker was seeking an armistice in the verbal war 
-- as opposed to a lasting compromise -- since both sides expected the fight to 
continue in a Senate-House conference committee, where a final version of the 
bill would be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
But the armistice would allow the measure to get through the House and into a 
forum where it was less likely to remain deadlocked, congressional sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, usually known for his amiable style of leadership, decided to force a 
showdown in this case because an expanded child-care program is near the top of 
the Democrats' legislative agenda and the deadlock showed no signs of being 
resolved by the opposing factions. 
</P>
<P>
By insisting on a House vote by the end of March, Foley put pressure on the two 
groups to end the long impasse rather than face a bruising floor battle that 
could leave lasting scars with no guarantee of success for either side. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, wants to create a new 
system of federal grants to expand access to child care, a position known as 
the "ABC" approach. 
</P>
<P>
He has the backing of organized labor and other national organizations, 
including the Children's Defense Fund, that have been among the chief 
proponents of child-care legislation over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, wants to earmark funds 
for child-care grants to states under Title 20 of the Social Security Act to 
avoid creating a new federal bureaucracy and to mute a possible church-state 
conflict over child care. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation backed by the Hawkins group contains language forbidding "any 
sectarian activity" in federally financed centers. Opponents of that provision 
contend that it would discourage use of religious institutions for child care. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) promised that the 
language would be removed during a Senate-House conference. Despite lengthy 
negotiations, the issue remained unresolved Wednesday and could prove to be a 
sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
Under one proposal to end the impasse among Democrats, the House leadership 
would support a bill that would include some provisions endorsed by Hawkins' 
committee and others favored by Rostenkowski's group. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the bill would authorize spending $1.75 billion for an expanded 
Head Start program to provide daylong care and year-round services, plus a new 
school-based program for early childhood development as well as preschool and 
after-school care. Those provisions were part of the Hawkins bill. 
</P>
<P>
But provisions dealing with a new system of federal grants to states would be 
dropped from the leadership bill, with the understanding that Hawkins and his 
supporters would be able to fight for their approach during a Senate-House 
conference on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Conference committee negotiators will seek to craft a compromise that will be 
acceptable to both sides and produce a bill that President Bush will sign into 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Downey already has discussed the child-care bill with John H. Sununu, the White 
House chief of staff, in hopes of averting a veto when a final version of the 
measure reaches the President's desk.

Suppose they held an election and no one voted. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened Tuesday when no one showed up for the Republican primary 
in this West Texas town, population 60. 
</P>
<P>
But election officials at Precinct 34 in Taylor County were not surprised. Only 
one person voted in the previous primaries. 
</P>
<P>
Shep's only Republican voter developed cancer and was sent to a hospital in 
Houston, county GOP Chairman Brent Casey said. The man had been the only GOP 
voter in primaries in 1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1986, there was not even a voting place for Republicans in Shep, which 
is 250 miles west of Dallas. Republicans had to vote in another precinct. 
</P>
<P>
Officials opened the GOP polling place Tuesday hoping to attract other voters, 
who were allowed to decide at the last minute whether to vote in the Democratic 
or Republican gubernatorial primary.

All West Virginia's public schools were closed Wednesday for the rest of the 
week as more than 8,000 striking teachers swarmed the state Capitol to denounce 
Gov. Gaston Caperton's proposal to end their illegal weeklong walkout. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are just getting out of hand in terms of tempers," state school Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Marockie said in shutting down schools in all 55 West Virginia counties 
today and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Local superintendents have had the option of closing schools since the strike 
began March 7, and more than 25 of them chose to do so Wednesday. Marockie's 
order, however, affects all 55 counties. 
</P>
<P>
Marockie said after the cooling-off period, county school systems will be 
expected to take action to discipline teachers who remain on strike. That 
action could range from reprimands to firing. 
</P>
<P>
Caperton went on statewide television Wednesday night saying he sympathized 
with the teachers, but that there was no money for raises.

GOVERNOR SAYS HE'LL BE FAIR ON HARRIS' FATE

Gov. George Deukmejian said Wednesday that in order to "keep faith with not 
only the law, but with myself" he will carefully consider the clemency request 
of condemned murderer Robert Alton Harris "in a fair and objective manner." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not just going through motions," the governor said in answer to a 
reporter's question. "I'm carrying out my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he decided to personally preside over Harris' scheduled 
clemency hearing at San Quentin prison on March 27 because only the governor 
can spare a condemned person from the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems to me that it would be better for everyone concerned for me to 
personally listen to what is offered (as) reason for granting clemency," the 
governor said. "I would have a much better grasp of the situation and the 
issues by being there myself and listening to it personally than simply reading 
a report prepared by some other person." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, scheduled to die on April 3 for the 1978 murder of two San Diego 
teen-agers, had asked the governor not to preside at his hearing. He asserted 
that as a longtime supporter of capital punishment Deukmejian is "committed to 
my execution." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to review whatever is presented at this clemency hearing in a fair 
and objective manner," the governor said. "I have to do that if I'm going to 
keep faith with not only the law but myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I look upon my responsibility at this point in the process much the same as 
I'm sure each juror who sat in that case looked upon their responsibility when 
they . . . made a recommendation that the death penalty be imposed. . . . I'm 
also in a similar position as the judge who thereafter imposed the sentence, or 
all of these (appellate) justices who have looked at this case." 
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that many people feel Harris' appeals process "has gone on 
for an unreasonable period of time." And he indicated that he agreed. Without 
referring specifically to Harris, Deukmejian said that after an accused person 
has "their fair day in court, if they're found guilty, then after the appeal 
process has taken place and the case has been decided by the highest court, 
then the sentences ought to go forward."

EXECUTION TIME CHANGED TO AVOID TRAFFIC JAM

<P>
San Quentin prison officials, trying to maintain good relations with Marin 
County residents and avoid commuter gridlock, have set 3 a.m. as the time to 
carry out California's first scheduled execution in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
California traditionally carried out executions at 10 a.m. But authorities 
believe that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of demonstrators will show up for the 
scheduled April 3 execution of convicted killer Robert Alton Harris. 
</P>
<P>
So they have rescheduled the execution for seven hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Christine May, California Department of Corrections spokeswoman, said the 
primary reason for the change was a desire to limit the potential impact on 
Marin County commuters and the enclave of San Quentin, a residential area of 
condominiums and older homes outside the main gates of the prison. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some concern about the impact of a large gathering of individuals, 
both media and private citizens," on the commuters and the San Quentin 
neighborhood, May said. 
</P>
<P>
San Quentin prison Warden Daniel Vasquez made the decision to move the 
execution back to 3 a.m. after visiting other states that conduct executions in 
early morning. Officer Mark Pieschke of the Marin County office of the 
California Highway Patrol said the CHP "wholeheartedly supports" the change in 
the execution time. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Oct. 17 Northern California earthquake, traffic has "drastically 
increased" on the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, which crosses San Francisco Bay 
near the prison. Large numbers of commuters began using the bridge when the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was closed for repairs, and many continue to use 
the route. 
</P>

Pieschke speculated that on the morning of the execution, some commuters would 
have strained to see the protesters, and "we would have had traffic backed up 
all the way" into the east side of San Francisco Bay.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY HEARS THE SHOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: FROM PASADENA TO POMONA, DRIVE-BY VIOLENCE HAS EXPLODED ACROSS THE 
SUBURBAN LANDSCAPE. BUT NUMBERS DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY.

The tiny yellow house near the Pomona railroad tracks was to be Marie 
Rodriguez's refuge from gang life. 
</P>
<P>
The month before, she and her two young children had gone to stay there with a 
friend, leaving behind her husband and, she hoped, the violent rivalries that 
have plagued the city for generations. 
</P>
<P>
But on the morning of Feb. 13, as the 23-year-old snack bar employee was 
helping clean house, she discovered how difficult it is to flee a war in which 
anyone can be considered fair game. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene played out nearly every day somewhere in the San Gabriel Valley, a 
car passed slowly by, a gang name was shouted out and several rounds from a 
shotgun were pumped into the bungalow. The apparent target: a rival gang member 
who had come over to offer use of his vacuum cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the lead pellets tore into the head of Rodriguez's son, Daniel, a 
Little League baseball player who had celebrated his seventh birthday just 
weeks earlier. Also hit was Olga Perez, 23, the friend who had given them a 
place to stay. Perez survived but Daniel died after four days in intensive 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"I left . . . to get away from this," Rodriguez said as she waited that first 
night in the hospital. "I just want it to stop." 
</P>
<P>
From Pasadena to Pomona, Altadena to Claremont, drive-by shootings have 
exploded across the suburban tracts east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In cities where gang attacks were rare 10 years ago, the drive-by reached 
record proportions in 1989. Pasadena, for instance, was so hard hit that 
officers for the first time began keeping a daily tally of the shootings, the 
only San Gabriel Valley police department to do so. 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, the number had reached a staggering 108 -- at least a 50% rise 
over the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
In many other communities where long-standing gang rivalries had fizzled over 
the last decade, the drive-by returned with a vengeance. Baldwin Park logged 68 
such shootings last year. The Industry area, including La Puente and Valinda, 
had more than 50, and tiny San Gabriel recorded 11. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, those figures reflect a rise in gang activity throughout Los 
Angeles County, where gang-related homicides have gone up 23%, from 452 murders 
in 1988 to 554 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But numbers alone don't tell the story of what happens when bullets fly 
indiscriminately, turning innocent bystanders, both young and old, into 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Although drive-by shootings are usually intended as retaliation against rival 
gang members -- not as random violence -- someone other than a rival gang 
member gets hit 20% to 50% of the time, according to various law enforcement 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they're not very discriminating as to who they shoot," said 
Pasadena Police Sgt. Monte Yancey. "And they don't seem to have much of a 
conscience." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of drive-by shootings in 1989, a middle-aged Monterey Park woman 
was hit in the face by stray shotgun pellets while waiting for a bus, a 
35-year-old Pasadena man was wounded as he stood in line next to two gang 
members at a hamburger stand, and three young Pomona men, ages 20, 18 and 17, 
were killed on a street corner, allegedly by gang members upset that they 
wouldn't join the gang. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old Rosemead boy was shot in the leg and thigh as he chatted with a 
friend in his driveway. Two high school football players from Baldwin Park were 
wounded, allegedly by gang members who mistook their car for that of a rival. 
And 21-year-old Michael Carrillo, a former San Gabriel resident who had moved 
to Missouri, was killed by shotgun blasts to the face and chest last September 
during a visit back to the community where his parents still live. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo was not a gang member, police say, but had been outside talking with 
old friends on a street that another gang considered rival turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Just another case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time," said San 
Gabriel Police Detective Kenneth Butler. "He wasn't even dressed like a 
gangbanger. He was wearing these little shorts and could have easily fit in 
with a bunch of kids at a party on Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Things were not like this before. 
</P>
<P>
Those who work closely with gang members say there has been an erosion of 
respect in recent years, a willingness to commit violent acts that even 
hardened gangbangers had previously considered unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons, say counselors and probation officers, include a new generation of 
smaller cliques that don't play by the rules of the older gangs, and the 
emergence of immigrant gangs from Mexico and Central America without ties to 
the traditions of longtime Chicano gangs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they point to the lawlessness engendered by the growth of the rock 
cocaine trade and a general sense among many of these youths that the line 
between right and wrong has been blurred by politics and warfare around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"They see viciousness, duplicity and stealing all around them," said Mike 
Duran, director of specialized youth services for the Los Angeles County 
Probation Department. "You tell me where people are honest with each other. The 
kids pick up on all these negatives and closely emulate them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost to the point of having to go back and retrain these guys," Duran 
added. "Tell them, 'Go ahead, be a gang member but . . . have some respect for 
yourself and people around you.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, many look back to an April 3, 1987, shooting at Holy Cross Cemetery 
as the point at which things took a turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Four people, including two girls, were wounded when rival gang members opened 
fire on a crowd of several hundred mourners who had come to bury a young man 
gunned down in a drive-by shooting the week before. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, four more people were wounded when a gunman fired into a 
crowd of youths who had gathered in a park to view a movie promoting 
alternatives to gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
As disturbing as those incidents were, 1989 ended up as Pomona's most violent 
year ever, with 44 murders. Nineteen of the victims were killed in drive-bys, 
which numbered more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
"If they kill a baby, they don't care," said Lt. Chuck Brantley, who works in 
the sheriff's anti-gang program, Operation Safe Streets. "They feel no remorse. 
They're doing what they were brought up to believe is right. In their own 
minds, they're soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, say the emotions are more complex. The fatal shooting last 
month of 7-year-old Daniel Rodriguez, for instance, troubled many people in the 
Cherrieville community, home to the gang member suspected of committing the 
murder, said Rudy Gutierrez, who grew up in the neighborhood and now works with 
high-risk youths at Fremont Junior High School in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody liked that Daniel got hit," Gutierrez said. "Some might not say 
anything, because they've been conditioned to think, 'Well, he just got in the 
way.' But they're still human. They still hurt." 
</P>
<P>
He applauded the mother whose 16-year-old boy is suspected of the shooting for 
turning her son in to police the next day. "I thought that was pretty noble, 
myself," Gutierrez said. And he praised the boy, whose name was not released 
because of his age, for accepting her rule. 
</P>
<P>
But police rarely get that kind of cooperation. Drive-by shootings are among 
the most difficult crimes to solve, officers say. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there are witnesses, many are afraid to testify for fear of 
retaliation. And if gang members are wounded, even critically, they frequently 
refuse to provide police with any information about their assailants. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been times when a guy's been shot and he's in the hospital and we've 
explained to him, 'You may die,' " said Baldwin Park Police Lt. Michael 
Bennett. "And they always say, 'I'll take care of it myself, or if I don't 
live, my home boys will take care of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is a culture, though, that has left many San Gabriel Valley communities 
untouched. More than half a dozen cities in the region had no drive-by 
shootings last year, including San Marino, South Pasadena, Arcadia, Irwindale 
and La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, a few towns not known for major gang problems did suffer from 
drive-bys, including Monrovia with a dozen, Claremont with five and Glendora 
with one. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the most part, the shootings were limited to low-income neighborhoods 
with large minority populations. 
</P>
<P>
They are the kinds of neighborhoods where most gang members reside and the 
kinds of neighborhoods where most victims, whether from rival gangs or not, 
also live and die. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is these gangs stereotype their victims," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Dennis E. Ferris, who handles hard-core gang cases at the Pomona courthouse. 
"To them, any young black or Hispanic male in a rival neighborhood is fair 
game. You might say these guys are as much racists as anyone else."

KENDALL BROTHERS LEAD TORRANCE PAST MIRA COSTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 20 years after Fred Kendall graduated from Torrance High School, his 
baseball bloodlines are paying off for his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall made the major leagues as a catcher, hitting .234 over an 11-year 
career that began and ended with the San Diego Padres. And today, 10 years 
after Kendall retired from baseball, his sons are carrying on at Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Senior pitcher Mike Kendall and his younger brother, Jason, a sophomore 
catcher, both played big parts in Torrance's 16-1 victory Wednesday afternoon 
over visiting Mira Costa at Torrance Park. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Kendall caught for his big brother and helped him out at the plate as 
well. Jason singled to left field in the first inning to drive in a pair of 
runs, then tripled to right and scored in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Jason finished off a three-for-three afternoon by lining a single past a diving 
Jason Garner, the Mira Costa starter turned shortstop, to chase home two more 
Torrance runs in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kendall, a hard-throwing right-hander, improved his record to 3-0 with 
nine strikeouts in five innings. Eight of Kendall's strikeouts were called. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike has been the man for us so far," said Torrance Coach Jeff Phillips, whose 
Tartars improved to 6-1. "The most runs we've given up in a game so far is 
five, and that's our only loss." 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars pounded out 16 hits for the afternoon and chased Garner in the 
third. Mira Costa relief pitchers Andy Owens and Jeff Diussa didn't fare much 
better, and the Mustangs fell to 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance second baseman Ruben Moreno went four for four with two doubles and a 
triple, and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Antone Williamson, Torrance's third baseman and leading hitter, raised his 
season RBI total to 13 with a pair Wednesday. Williamson went four for four, 
including a pair of doubles and two stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, 11-15 last season, is the South Bay's most surprising team this year. 
The Tartars' only loss so far was a 5-3 defeat by Cerritos in the El Segundo 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance gets a rematch at Cerritos on Saturday at 11 a.m. in the first round 
of the Palos Verdes/Redondo Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame anybody for being surprised, because we hadn't done anything in 
the past," Phillips said. "We have a long way to go, but we've got to be real 
pleased with the way we're playing."

EL SEGUNDO GIVES COACH PLENTY TO SMILE ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm pretty happy with the way everything is," said John Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo High School baseball coach had reason to be pleased after the 
Eagles captured the consolation title at their own 32-team tournament last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* After losing its opener to Alhambra, 6-5, El Segundo won four straight games 
and closed the tournament by scoring a total of 44 runs in wins over North 
Torrance, Lynwood and Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
* Senior left-hander Jason Wayt, who missed most of last season with a shoulder 
injury, posted two victories and had 17 strikeouts in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
* Wayt, first baseman-pitcher Tate Seefried, catcher Garret Quaintance and 
third baseman Brett Newell hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is pounding the ball," said Stevenson, whose team batted .358 last 
season on its way to the Southern Section 2-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Are the Eagles capable of hitting that well again? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but Stevenson said there are more important statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, our pitching and defense were just superb," he said. "We didn't 
walk anybody and we didn't make errors. That had a lot more to do with winning 
than our team batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our defense has a chance to equal last year." 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. El Segundo committed six errors in five tournament games, 
including two errorless games. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles open Camino Real League play at 7 p.m. Friday against Serra at 
Recreation Park in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said El Segundo's lineup is set at every position except center 
field, where he started a different player in each of the first five games. 
</P>
<P>
After the auditions, the coach has narrowed the field to sophomore Chris Feeny 
and senior Tony Bartolucci. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Feeny is one of the school's finest underclass athletes, 
Stevenson said. Bartolucci, the starting point guard on the basketball team, is 
regarded as a hard-working competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be solid no matter who is there," Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
But not as strong as last year, when the Eagles started All-CIF choice Erik 
Evans in center field, Jeremy Carr in left and Kenny Talanoa in right. Only 
Talanoa returns. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year's outfield was probably the best I've ever had," Stevenson said. 
"Evans and Carr both flew, and all three of them had great arms." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance basketball Coach Bob Little reports that colleges are finally 
recruiting Tartar guard Rick Robison. 
</P>
<P>
He said Fresno State, Cal State Fullerton and Gonzaga have shown the most 
interest in the 6-foot-2 sharpshooter, who led the South Bay in scoring this 
season with a 34.5 average. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect things to pick up after the blue-chippers sign," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Robison averaged 32 points per game during his two-year varsity 
career, recruiters have not been beating a path to his door. Critics say he 
lacks size and has a poor attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Little doesn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
"People warned me about his attitude," he said. "Boy, I sure didn't see it. He 
came out every game and did a great job. And he did it against defenses 
designed to stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Robison made 86 three-point shots this season, down slightly from the 94 he 
made as a junior, to finish his career with 180. Unofficially, that places him 
third on the all-time Southern Section list. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills guard Steve Clover, a Pepperdine recruit, is the leader with 288 
career three-pointers, followed by former Glendora star Tracy Murray with 224. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance third baseman Antone Williamson, an All-South Bay pick last year as a 
sophomore when he hit .463, is off to another impressive start. 
</P>
<P>
In five games in the El Segundo Tournament, Williamson batted .471 (eight for 
17) with two triples, two home runs and 11 runs batted in. His solo home run 
and two singles Saturday helped the Tartars defeat Millikan, 8-4, in the 
tournament's ninth-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste pitched around the junior Tuesday in Torrance's 7-4 win, walking him 
three times, twice intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of games, we've had three or four scouts come up and ask about 
Antone," Torrance Coach Jeff Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson also excels in the classroom. He received four A's and one B in 
academic classes on his latest report card. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just got it," Phillips said. "He's a super kid." 
</P>
<P>
Redondo's baseball team fared well in the Westside Tournament last week, 
finishing with two straight victories and a 3-2 record, despite the loss of its 
No. 1 pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Brian Fitzgerald is suffering from tendinitis of the elbow 
and will be sidelined at least until next week, said Redondo Coach Tim 
Ammentorp. He was forced to leave the team's second game after working three 
innings against Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have (had him throw) too much in practice," Ammentorp said of 
Fitzgerald, who was 3-3 and pitched a perfect game in a five-inning win over 
Morningside last season. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo could use Fitzgerald today. The Sea Hawks face Hawthorne, one of the 
area's strongest hitting teams, at 4 p.m. in a double-header at Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead: Perhaps the best match-up next season in South Bay girls 
basketball will occur when Palos Verdes, led by 6-3 Monique Morehouse, faces 
Morningside, led by 6-4 Janet Davis, in the realigned Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
Both players are sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had 12 points and six rebounds Friday to help Morningside defeat 
Washington, 61-45, in the Southern California Division I title game. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Morehouse had 10 points and 12 rebounds as Palos Verdes came close to 
upsetting unbeaten Brea-Olinda before falling, 47-46, in the Division III 
Regional finals. 
</P>
<P>
How good was Bishop Montgomery's boys basketball team this season? 
</P>
<P>
Good enough to sweep two Angelus League games against Servite of Anaheim, which 
faces Mt. Eden of Haywood in the State Division III championship game Saturday 
in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Bishop Montgomery's baseball team lost to North Torrance, 7-4, 
Tuesday night at Torrance Park. It was the Knights' third straight defeat and 
dropped the team to 1-3-2 overall. "I wish I had an answer," said Bishop 
Montgomery Coach Bob Anderson, whose team was ranked No. 2 in The Times' South 
Bay preseason top 10. . . . Torrance left-hander Dennis Miller, who missed all 
of last season after suffering a lacerated arm in a car accident, pitched 5 2/3 
innings Tuesday in a 7-4 win over Miraleste to improve to 2-0. . . . The 
championship of the Hawthorne Softball Tournament will be decided Saturday. The 
host Cougars face Santa Monica and Torrance meets Rolling Hills in 10:30 a.m. 
semifinals. The winners play for the title at 1:30. . . . Mira Costa's boys 
volleyball team, ranked No. 1 in the nation, opened defense of its Ocean League 
title Tuesday with a 15-1, 15-2, 15-0 victory over visiting Centennial. The 
Mustangs improved to 3-0 overall.

TITLE FOE WARNS MORNINGSIDE;

<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: BERKELEY HIGH COACH SAYS THE LADY MONARCHS WILL BE IN FOR A 
TOUGH FIGHT IN SATURDAY'S STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Berkeley High School girls basketball Coach Gene Nakamura doesn't think it 
would be prudent for Morningside to print up those "Back-to-Back State 
Champions" T-shirts just yet. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura's comparatively unsung Yellowjackets (31-1) play the well-publicized 
Lady Monarchs (31-3) on Saturday at 4:45 p.m. in the Oakland-Alameda County 
Coliseum Arena for the state Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not awed by them at all," Nakamura said earlier this week. "We're 
confident, OK? They are going to have to come and play a game against us 
because we're ready to play. And when we're on our game, we play like guys, not 
girls." 
</P>
<P>
Most opponents have double- and triple-teamed 6-foot-5 Morningside center Lisa 
Leslie, who has nonetheless scored 27 points per game. But Nakamura said his 
team will often play the senior All-American with straight man-to-man defense 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said that approach is justified because he has the better post player 
in 6-0 senior Jualeah Woods, who is averaging 18 points per game. The Lady 
Monarchs beat the Yellowjackets early last season, but Berkeley led for much of 
the game and eschewed gimmick defenses against Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Woods played (Leslie) head up and outplayed her," Nakamura said. 
"We know what we can do, and we know what they can do. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been anxious to play them again, and the approach will be the same." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Morningside Coach Frank Scott said he is eager for his team to 
face a non-doubling defense. But he said he doubts that it will last. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they do it that way," Scott said. "She's kind of tough to play 
one-on-one. If Lisa is effective, I think they'll have to go to the double 
team. Woods is a good player, but I don't think she can handle Lisa 
one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
The game will be played just a few minutes down the freeway from the Berkeley 
campus, but Nakamura isn't counting on a big home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"This season, we have not received a lot of (fan) support," said Nakamura, 
whose team trails only Morningside in the Cal-Hi Sports Weekly Division I 
ratings and won the Northern California Regional championship in Oakland last 
Saturday. "But the fact that we are playing Morningside is going to draw a lot 
of people because they want to see Lisa Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, when they come to see Lisa Leslie, they're going to see a hell of a 
Berkeley team." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who took the Monarchs to a tournament in Tennessee earlier this season, 
said playing in the Bay Area "will help (Berkeley) a little, but it won't hurt 
us much. We're used to playing on the road and have played in some pretty 
foreign places." 
</P>
<P>
The Yellowjackets have outscored their opponents by an average of 36 points per 
game and feature up to six future NCAA Division I players, Nakamura said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting along with Woods will be junior forward Alexandra Kay, who is 
averaging 16 points per game. Junior Tanda Rucker (18 points per game) is the 
point guard, while sophomore Lynda Robinson (13 points) and senior Vikki Horne 
(eight points) are also in Berkeley's three-guard lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Janet Davis (10 points per game) and junior Akiba Flanagan (five 
points) start at forward for the Lady Monarchs. Morningside juniors Princess 
Murray (six points) and Bridgete Williams (nine points) are the usual starting 
guards, but junior Tyesha Whiting will start in place of Williams, who injured 
ligaments in her leg last week. (Although it was originally thought that 
Williams was out for the season, she has a chance to play Saturday, Scott 
said.) 
</P>
<P>
Scott saw Berkeley play at this season's Tournament of Champions in Santa 
Barbara. The Yellowjackets suffered their only loss of the year there to Los 
Angeles Washington, the team Morningside beat, 61-45, for the right to 
represent Southern California in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a fine team," Scott acknowledged. "They have some good athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"(Woods) is a legitimate 6-footer and very quick. And they have a good guard in 
Tanda Rucker." 
</P>
<P>
Scott may be underestimating the Yellowjackets if he thinks they have just one 
good guard, according to Nakamura, who said: "I figure I've got three of the 
best guards in the state -- two of the best defensive guards and probably the 
best point in the state." 
</P>
<P>
And with Williams not starting for Morningside, Nakamura added, his team has "a 
back-court advantage" which it will try to exploit at both ends of the court. 
</P>
<P>
"We push the ball up and play pressure defense," he said. "They will have to 
make some adjustments to play against our speed, our press and our 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We make very few fundamental-skill turnovers. We just don't make mistakes, and 
we do not beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Williams hasn't played in the last two Morningside games, and Scott admitted 
that the Lady Monarchs have been susceptible to turnover problems recently. But 
he said he has confidence in his guards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've handled (Williams' absence) pretty well so far," he said. "I think we'll 
be OK there." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens on the perimeter, the focus of the game for most observers 
will remain in the lane -- because that's where Lisa Leslie is. But Nakamura 
maintains that they're going to find themselves watching a lot of Jualeah 
Woods, too. 
</P>
<P>
"(Leslie) gets a lot of P.R. and so does Janet (Davis)," he said. "Woods is 
probably not getting her due. If you ask any of the college coaches on the 
coast, they'll tell you that she's an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
"Matter of fact, this summer at an all-star camp in Long Beach, Woods got MVP 
over Lisa. The same schools that are after Lisa are after Jualeah."

RANCHO SANTIAGO SHOOTS DOWN HARBOR AND EL CAMINO IN TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Santiago proved to be a post-season nightmare for two South Bay 
basketball teams. The Dons, who defeated Chabot, 72-65, to win the state junior 
college title Saturday, eliminated both Harbor and El Camino in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago nailed the Seahawks, 105-86, in the second round and beat El 
Camino, 81-70, on Friday in the semifinals of the state Final Eight Tournament 
at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor, the third-place team in the Southern California Athletic Conference, 
finished with a 23-13 mark. El Camino, which tied for third in the South Coast 
Conference, ended at 24-11. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a good chance against them," El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin 
said after Friday's loss, "but they were tough. They were real tough." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago's success didn't disappoint all local observers, however. The 
Santa Ana school has strong South Bay ties. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons' coach, Dana Pagett, was a CIF player of the year at El Segundo High 
School in 1967. He went on to play at USC from 1968 to 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Pagett's first coaching job was as an assistant at Loyola Marymount University 
in 1974. He coached at Cal State Long Beach and Utah State University before 
taking over at Rancho Santiago in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Pagett has led the Dons to the state playoffs four times and has a 165-92 
record at the school. This season's team went 32-3. 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino women were also eliminated in the state basketball playoffs by 
the eventual champion. After defeating Moorpark in the first round, the 
Warriors got mauled, 130-80, by Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it was a good season for El Camino, which placed second to 
co-champions Cerritos and Mt. San Antonio in the South Coast Conference. The 
Warriors finished 22-8 under second-year head Coach Kristy Loesener. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Stanbury is confident that his El Camino swim teams will make it to the 
state meet this year. In only his second year as head coach, Stanbury said he 
has the personnel to at least place second in the seven-member South Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a pretty strong men's team," Stanbury said. "I think we definitely 
have a chance to get into the (state's) top 10." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' strength lies in the sprint and breast-stroke events. Sophomore 
Dan Wilkenson leads the pack in the 100- and 200-yard freestyle. Freshman Scott 
Peppard, a 1983 graduate of Palos Verdes High, is perhaps the team's best 
sprinter. He will compete in the 50- and 100-yard events. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Charles Kissel, an all-conference water polo player at El Camino last 
year, is also a top-notch sprinter and mid-distance swimmer who is expected to 
qualify for the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
All-American Todd Douglas leads the breast-strokers. The sophomore placed 
fourth in the 100-yard breast-stroke at last year's state meet in Diablo 
Valley. Mira Costa freshman Bret Johnson will also compete in the 100 
breast-stroke and several freestyle sprints. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have a deep team," Stanbury said. "We should do very well this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The women's team isn't as strong as the men's, but Stanbury said it has 
improved since last year. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Standardi is the Warriors' top returner in the 100 and 200 freestyle. 
Last year Standardi, a graduate of Rolling Hills High, competed primarily in 
the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Stanbury, the coach's wife, is expected to be one of the team's leading 
breast-strokers. Nancy, 40, is a top masters swimmer who competed for one year 
at Ventura College when Stanbury coached at Class Aquatics in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ronona Smith, 29, is also one of the Warriors' top breast-strokers. The Carson 
High graduate competed at El Camino in 1979 and is back in full force, Stanbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dusty Crayton will lead El Camino in the 50 and 100 butterfly. The freshman 
from Redondo High qualified for the CIF meet last year in the 100 butterfly and 
a freestyle relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Terry McFate found himself in an unfamiliar situation last Friday. The El 
Camino women's track coach suffered his first loss since coming to the program 
in 1984. The defending state champion Warriors lost to Long Beach in a tri-meet 
at Cerritos, giving McFate a 36-1 career mark at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"He was upset," said El Camino Athletic Director Dave Shannon, the Warriors' 
former cross-country and track coach, "but he was very philosophical about it. 
He was down several athletes. There were illnesses and family emergencies and 
some ineligibilities." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, El Camino lost several key athletes from last year's state 
championship team. But the Warriors have a tremendous bright spot in Sharette 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore broke her own 800-meter school record at the Aztec Invitational 
in San Diego last weekend. Her 2:07.92 finish in San Diego ranks tops in the 
nation among junior college runners. 
</P>
<P>
Winning marks are nothing new for Garcia, who swept the 800-meter state title 
last year and placed second in the 1,500 meters. She was also part of El 
Camino's state champion 4 x 400 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Another bright spot is newcomer Diana Tracy, who placed third for El Camino in 
the state championship cross-country meet. The 37-year-old has already topped 
the Southern California mark in the 3,000 meters (10:12). 
</P>
<P>
"She's incredible," said assistant track coach Dean Lofgren, who is also the 
Warriors' head cross-country coach. "It's early in the season, and she's 
already getting top marks. She'll definitely make it to state."

KUNISHIMA, HOLLAHAN TO TAKE PART IN U. S. SWIMMING SENIOR NATIONALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Kunishima and Ted Hollahan of Cal State Northridge will compete in the U. 
S. Swimming Senior Nationals from March 20-23 at the Centennial Sportsplex in 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. team for the Goodwill Games in Seattle in August will be selected 
based on times from the Senior Nationals and the NCAA Division I meet. 
</P>
<P>
Kunishima was selected most valuable male swimmer at the NCAA Division II 
Swimming and Diving Championships in Buffalo, N. Y., last week. He won the 
200-yard individual medley (in a college-division-record 1 minute 49.81 
seconds) and the 200-yard freestyle (1:37.78) and placed second in the 100-yard 
backstroke (51.37) and 100-yard freestyle (44.25). 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore from Hacienda Heights might participate in the same events in the 
Senior Nationals, although Kunishima could opt for the 50-yard freestyle 
instead of the 200 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
Hollahan is scheduled to swim all three freestyle events in Nashville. The 
senior from Denver placed fifth in the 50 freestyle (20.87), third in the 100 
freestyle (44.55) and second in the 200 freestyle (1:38.20) last week.

PICHARDO HELPS NORTH HOLLYWOOD UPSET SYLMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the bases loaded in the bottom of the seventh inning, North Hollywood 
High's Nelson Pichardo singled to left field to drive in winning pitcher Sammy 
Ciaramilaro, lifting the host Huskies to a 4-3 upset over East Valley League 
power Sylmar on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rally started when Ciaramilaro (1-1), who walked 11 but gave up just four 
hits in going the distance, singled. He moved to third when basketball star 
Harry Marks doubled to left-center. After intentionally walking Mike Lewis, 
losing pitcher James Encinas surrendered the game-winning hit. 
</P>

IT'S EVERYBODY INTO THE POOL FOR STANBURYS; 
</P>
<P>
NANCY, AT 40, IS ON THE EL CAMINO COLLEGE TEAM. HER HUSBAND, COREY IS THE COACH 
AND DAUGHTER ASHLEY "SWIMS LIKE A FISH." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Stanbury prepared for swim practice at El Camino College earlier this 
week. She had her 11 month-old daughter Tracy in one hand and a bottle of milk 
in the other. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley, Stanbury's 5-year old daughter, pranced around the pool's perimeter 
screaming, "Mommy! mommy! mommy!" as she waved a Mickey Mouse sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury waited for the baby-sitter, who arrived at 2 p.m., before changing 
into her own bathing suit. Adjusting a bathing cap, she jumped in the water and 
proceeded to swim warm-up laps. 
</P>
<P>
The children watched for a moment, then went on doing their own thing. 
Stanbury's husband Corey, however, watched intensely for the duration of the 
demanding two-hour practice. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Stanbury, a well-known national junior swimming coach, is in his second 
year as the men's and women's coach at El Camino. He brought a wealth of 
experience to the Warriors' struggling program. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking over in Torrance, he coached numerous elite swimmers at Class 
Aquatics, one of the largest age-group swimming clubs in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a scarce roster, he led the El Camino women to a 3-3 South Coast 
Conference mark last year. This year he's blessed with a crop of talented 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
His wife is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Every afternoon it's a Stanbury family affair at the El Camino pool, but it's 
no picnic. Mom has a strenuous workout, swimming up to 5,000 yards a day, and 
Dad paces pool side while yelling phrases of encouragement to his predominantly 
young swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Ashley greets her mother at the end of the lane during timed 
workouts. She cheers enthusiastically while jumping up and down; "go Mom, go, 
go, go, go!" 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury, 40, is the team's oldest athlete and also one of the top breast 
strokers. She always keeps up with the swimmers in the neighboring lanes, 
though the majority of them are half her age. 
</P>
<P>
"She does pretty well against most of them," said Corey, 38. "This is a good 
level for someone like her to compete in. I think she has an outside chance of 
qualifying for state. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy is a very self-motivated person. I never have to push her. She gets in 
and really wants to go. I think she's a good example for the other kids." 
</P>
<P>
Warrior assistant coach David Clark says Stanbury's technique is better than 
that of most junior college swimmers. Like Corey, he believes Stanbury will 
qualify for the state meet in May. "She's probably more consistent than the 
younger kids," Clark said. "She always makes workouts . . . and she always 
gives 100%." 
</P>
<P>
A top Masters swimmer in the early 1980s, Stanbury returned to competition to 
get in shape after her second pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after the couple's first daughter was born, Stanbury competed at 
Ventura College where she was an all-conference breast stroker. 
</P>
<P>
Corey said jokingly: "It's something she does in between kids." 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury competed for the Park Terrace swim club while growing up in Sacramento 
and says she wanted to see how far she could go this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very frustrated with the shape I was in after having the baby," she 
said. "I had to do something. Plus I wanted to find out something about myself. 
'Do I still have it at 40?' 
</P>
<P>
"And I must say I've surprised myself. I'm surprised that I could still get 
back in shape. I've already lost 14 pounds. Plus it's one way of getting to 
spend time with my busy husband." 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury says grueling practices and lengthy swim meets aren't the toughest 
part of being on the team. Switching gears from mother to competitor is more 
difficult because her mother role is flexible and submissive. The opposite, she 
says, is required to succeed in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest challenges of doing this," Stanbury said, "actually the 
main challenge, is getting the kids to cooperate with coming here. Convincing 
Ashley that 'yes, we're going to El Camino again' -- for the fourth time this 
week." 
</P>
<P>
After practice Corey rewards Ashley by taking her in the pool. "She swims like 
a fish," Stanbury said. "She's been around pools for so long and she's picked 
it up. She really loves it." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's a genetic thing. As a child and adolescent swimming was the happiest 
part of Stanbury's life. She competed in age-group events from the time she was 
5 until she was 17. 
</P>
<P>
There was no collegiate women's swimming at the time, so Stanbury remained 
active by competing for swim clubs. In 1970 she took a job with General 
Telephone in Santa Barbara and joined a swim club there where Corey had coached 
for several years before moving to Los Altos. 
</P>
<P>
In a short time Stanbury dominated the Masters' breast stroke events. She broke 
every Southern California Masters record in her age group (30-33). She placed 
first in the 50, 100 and 200-meters as well as the 50, 100 and 200-yards. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 she competed in the first Masters International meet in New Zealand, 
placing fourth in the 200 breast stroke despite a nagging back injury. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, at the Masters National meet in Indianapolis, Stanbury broke the 
200-meter record with a mark (3:01.70) that has since been broken. 
</P>
<P>
A mutual friend introduced her to Corey at the Masters National meet in 
Portland, Ore., in August of 1982. Corey was a former swimmer and water polo 
player at UC Santa Barbara and the winner of five national Masters titles (50, 
100 and 200-yard backstroke). 
</P>
<P>
"We were set up," Stanbury said smiling. "They (friends) thought it would be a 
good match." 
</P>
<P>
They were married in May, 1983, and so far they've proven their friends right. 
The coach-athlete relationship only exists during practices and meets. At home 
in Torrance, they're a typical family. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I get in the pool," Stanbury said, "he ceases to be my husband. He's 
strictly my coach. And I get no breaks. He doesn't cut me any slack because I'm 
40 or I'm his wife." 
</P>
<P>
Ronona Smith, another top El Camino competitor breast stroke, says Stanbury 
works harder than most. Smith, 29, was a swimmer at El Camino in 1980 when 
Corey was a part-time coach. In three years as a part-timer he led the Warriors 
to a conference title, two second places in conference and a third-place state 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no partiality," Smith said. "She (Stanbury) gets no special treatment 
even though she has a really hectic schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury's day starts at 6:30 a.m. She feeds her daughters, takes the oldest 
one to preschool and attends class through television courses at home. 
</P>
<P>
She gets Ashley from school at noon and goes home for the kids' snack before 
heading to El Camino for a 2-4 p.m. practice. Then she rushes home to make 
dinner for the family. Her only free time is after 8 p.m., when both children 
are in bed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I get to talk to my husband," she said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury says swimming is seldom the topic of conversation at home. She says 
occasionally they'll discuss training strategies, but it's unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll ask him questions," Stanbury said. "Like on the days I feel 
beat into the ground I'll ask him 'did we have to do so much breast stroke 
today? We did over 3,000 yards!' And he'll say something like 'this will make 
your 200 breast stroke awesome.' He really doesn't play coach with me at home." 
</P>
<P>
After El Camino Stanbury will go back to competing in age-group events. She's 
using the season to prepare for this year's Masters short-course (yards) 
nationals at USC. There she'll compete at the low end of the 40-44 age group. 
</P>
<P>
She laughed again as she observed, "I'll be a youngster again!"

CLARK IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY; 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTIAN: ADAPTABILITY OF OTHER PATRIOTS WAS AS IMPORTANT AS NEW GUY'S SCORING 
AS TEAM REACHED DIVISION V STATE FINAL. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last season, Christian High had a mediocre boys' basketball team. The Patriots 
finished with a 14-12 record and were fourth in the City Central League. 
</P>
<P>
But then something happened, making Christian one of the most competitive and 
talked-about small-school teams in the state: Tony Clark, the county's leading 
scorer in 1988-89, decided to transfer from Valhalla. And when a three-member 
subcommittee of the San Diego Section Board of Managers voted to waive the 
public-to-private transfer rule, allowing Clark to play, Christian's future 
immediately became brighter. 
</P>
<P>
But a great player doesn't automatically make a great team or winning season. 
It was awkward at first. Just as it is breaking in a new pair of shoes, it took 
time for the Patriots to feel comfortable playing with somebody of Clark's 
caliber. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior at Valhalla, Clark averaged 29.3 points per game and was named The 
Times' section player of the year. This year, he averaged 44 points, scoring 
1,312 for the season, finishing with 2,522 for his career and breaking a number 
of section records. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony had to create his own shots (at first)," Christian Coach Randy Wright 
said. "He's still creating shots, but the kids are getting the ball to him in 
better spots. The kids have progressed to a point where we're a pretty decent 
basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty decent" seems an understatement coming from a coach whose team is now 
19-11 and will play Colusa (27-2) for the Division V state championship Friday 
in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we would've gotten this much better without Tony," Wright said, 
"but I don't think we would have gone this far if the kids hadn't progressed as 
much as they did." 
</P>
<P>
At first the players watched Clark more than they played with him. In February, 
Wright said, they were getting more used to Clark, and Christian began to 
improve. The Patriots finished second in the City Harbor League with a 5-3 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play with a great ballplayer like Tony, you're going to learn," 
Wright said. "They had to learn not to stand around and watch him but move 
around to the open gap and be ready for the good passes. 
</P>
<P>
"They've definitely progressed. The kids understand their roles and are very 
unselfish." 
</P>
<P>
Added Jeff Rose: "At the start of the year, it was just Tony, and everyone else 
was just on the court. Now we're more of a team." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said that during the playoffs, others were making key plays. Wright 
continues to talk about Rose's steal and three-point play that helped Christian 
to a 44-43 regional quarterfinal victory over Paramount Brethren. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very tough high school play," Wright said. "He's learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Brad Fox, the lone returning starter, doesn't score much but is a "role 
player," Wright said, vital in rebounding on both ends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for him to have a pretty good game Friday," Wright said. "He's had 
games (scoring) in the 20s. He's real good at giving that up and giving the 
ball to Tony." 
</P>
<P>
Against Canoga Park Faith Baptist in Christian's regional semifinal victory, 
junior Dave Piester scored 18 points and had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to get him into the flow early," Wright said. "If we can get 
him rebounding early in the game, he gets the confidence he needs offensively." 
</P>
<P>
Added Piester: "Toward the second half of the season, there was more chemistry 
between us, and we began getting used to Tony. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great player."

PASADENA UNIFIED MOVES ACTING CHIEF TO SUPERINTENDENT; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: THE BOARD AND ITS CHOICE WILL MEET TODAY TO DRAW UP A NEW CONTRACT 
DESPITE CRITICISM THAT A BROADER SEARCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The acting superintendent of the Pasadena Unified School District has been 
given the job permanently and will meet with the school board today to draw up 
a contract. 
</P>
<P>
If both parties agree to the contract terms, which are being negotiated, the 
board will confirm the appointment of Phil Linscomb, 58, at a special meeting 
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very grateful to the board for demonstrating the kind of confidence they 
have by offering me this position," said Linscomb, who was Pasadena's deputy 
superintendent of instruction for four years. On Jan. 3, he was appointed 
acting superintendent after the retirement of Phillip Jordan, who left the 
$91,000-a-year post last year. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to offer Linscomb the job was criticized by board member Elbie 
Hickambottom, who has long favored an outside search. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are talking about the chief executive for a school district the size 
and diversity of Pasadena, I think (at) minimum a state search would be in 
order, if not a national search," Hickambottom said. 
</P>
<P>
Linscomb, who cautioned Wednesday that the contract remains to be signed, said 
nonetheless that he hopes soon to formalize his temporary arrangement with 
Pasadena Unified. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful challenge that . . . I look forward to," Linscomb said. "This 
is a very diverse school district and I believe that diversity is one of its 
strengths." 
</P>
<P>
Linscomb has spent most of his adult life in education. He has a doctorate in 
school administration from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah; a master's 
degree from Cal State Los Angeles and a bachelor's degree from UCLA in 
elementary teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Before Pasadena, he was an associate superintendent of instruction for Los 
Angeles Unified School District for eight years. Linscomb also served as 
director of student integration for that district. 
</P>
<P>
In his four years at Pasadena Unified, Linscomb helped start a variety of 
programs that: 
</P>
<P>
Improved CAP scores districtwide. In eighth-grade history and science, CAP 
scores have risen 23 points in two years, Linscomb said. 
</P>
<P>
Involved Pasadena Unified in the annual academic decathlon and pentathlon 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
Increased opportunity for minority youngsters with programs such as MESA, the 
"math and engineering science achievement" program. 
</P>
<P>
Established teaching partnerships with Cal State L.A.

ASSESSMENT DISTRICT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted unanimously to form a landscaping and lighting 
assessment district that will cost the average homeowner nearly $93 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The council took action even though 7,000 people signed petitions against the 
plan. However, city officials said the protesters own no more than 28% of the 
property to be assessed, and many do not own property in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The new fees will take effect July 1. The council has adopted an assessment 
formula that taxes property on the basis of its size and use. The assessment, 
designed to raise $1.2 million a year, applies to all private property in the 
city.

Immediate implementation of a curbside recycling program, recommended by the 
Citizen's Recycling Committee, will be discussed at the next City Council 
meeting March 27. 
</P>
<P>
Since October, the city has been conducting a pilot project involving Western 
Waste Industries and 933 residences. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed citywide program, each dwelling unit would be charged a 
recycling fee of $1.50 a month. Service would begin the first week in April. 
Residents would receive orange containers in which to deposit aluminum, 
plastics, tin cans and glass. Newspapers would also be picked up if placed next 
to the container.

REBATES FOR AUTO DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's auto dealers will be eligible for sales tax rebates under an 
ordinance tentatively approved Tuesday by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, the city's Housing and Development Department must first 
establish a redevelopment project in order to legally return tax money to 
dealers within the project boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers in the redevelopment project area who wish to build or expand their 
showrooms could apply for a rebate equaling up to 50% of the sales tax 
generated by the new facilities. The rebates could continue up to 10 years from 
the date of the construction. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was passed in an effort to keep the city's 16 auto dealers from 
leaving for auto malls in neighboring areas. Pasadena's dealerships provide the 
city $3 million a year in sales taxes.

A CASE OF COURT CONGESTION

The cost of switching Sierra Madre from the Pasadena Municipal Court District 
to the Santa Anita Court District will be examined by the city manager and the 
police department. 
</P>
<P>
The change was proposed by City Councilman George Maurer, who believes the 
Pasadena system is too congested. Using the Santa Anita Municipal Court in 
Monrovia will be faster and more convenient for Sierra Madre residents and 
Sierra Madre police officers who need to appear in court for traffic citations 
and misdemeanor violations, he said.

SOMETHING NEW FOR SAN GABRIEL: A TRANQUIL CITY COUNCIL CAMPAIGN 
</P>

<P>
The stunning fact of the current City Council election campaign is the absence 
of any obvious rancor in a community once synonymous with down-and-dirty 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
So far, not even a public candidates' forum has been scheduled before the April 
10 balloting in which incumbents Ted R. Anderson and Sabino M. Cici and 
challenger Dominic S. Polimeni are vying for two seats. 
</P>
<P>
Tranquility, however, is a recent phenomenon. In 1987, the electorate, upset by 
population growth that was changing the look of the city of 34,000, imposed a 
moratorium on residential and commercial construction. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, a slow-growth slate swept three council members and the city 
treasurer from office. A fourth council member resigned soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a vitriolic and successful recall of one of the newly elected council 
members, Frank Blaszcak. After being thrown out of office by a nine-vote margin 
in May, he sued those who campaigned against him for libel and slander. The 
suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member council has imposed a building moratorium to limit growth and 
has taken steps to curb the density of residential housing and commercial 
development. In addition, the council recently approved an ordinance 
prohibiting construction of bulky, two-story houses that would dominate small 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
Although the three council candidates say growth and development remain issues, 
each stresses maintaining orderliness with the city's governmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back on the path of being positive again. It's the makeup of the City 
Council that's doing it," said Cici, a 12-year councilman who owns and operates 
a local locksmith shop. 
</P>
<P>
"My issue is experience," the 50-year-old Cici said. "I'm the only council 
member with more than two years on the council." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also cites his experience. "People have indicated to me that I was one 
of the stabilizing forces on the council," he said. "I have a mission I still 
want to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who was campaign manager for the slow-growth slate that won in 1988 
and was appointed to replace the councilwoman who resigned, is an administrator 
for the Los Angeles office of the National Council on Aging. He is in his 60s 
but won't disclose his age, saying it is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
In his first run for office, Polimeni casts himself as not beholden to any 
particular political group. Polimeni, a seven-year member of the Parks and 
Recreation Commission, says he has been active in community affairs for the 
nearly 20 years he has lived here. Since 1975, the 49-year-old Polimeni has 
been administrator of Alhambra Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
He would apply the same kind of energy to the council post, he says, that he 
has in his administrative job, where he has overseen establishment of a new 
courthouse child-care facility, a joint effort between the city of Alhambra and 
Los Angeles County.

CAL POLY WOMEN FACE TOUGH TEST ON WAY TO FINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team is just one win away from its 
second straight berth in the NCAA Division II final four tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But the Broncos, who won the Division II West Regional last week, have a 
difficult opponent standing in the way. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, 27-3 and ranked No. 2 in Division II, will host fourth-ranked North 
Dakota -- which is also 27-3 -- in the division quarterfinals at 7:30 p.m. 
Friday at Kellogg Gymnasium in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Sioux, which have a four-game winning streak, defeated rival North Dakota 
State, 90-58, to win the Division II North Central Regional in Grand Forks last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to the final four tournament that will be played March 23 
and 24 at an undetermined site. Pomona is among the schools bidding to host the 
final four, and the site will be announced by the NCAA on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have won three national titles and finished second three times 
since joining Division II in the 1981-82 season, and take a 20-game winning 
streak into the North Dakota game. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been led by a strong inside game that features center Niki Bracken 
and forward Marcine Edmonds. Bracken, a 6-2 senior, is averaging 19.3 points 
and 9.5 rebounds and Edmonds, a 6-1 senior, 13.8 points and 6.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have also received consistent play from reserve center Danielle 
Carter, a 6-2 freshman from Fontana High who is averaging 9.9 points and 6.8 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pomona has a top player at guard in Stephanie Coons. The 5-11 
junior, who had a career high of 22 points and 16 rebounds in the team's 89-63 
win over Air Force in the first round of the playoffs, is averaging 9.8 points, 
5.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists. 
</P>
<P>
While the Broncos have flourished with their inside game, North Dakota has been 
sparked by potent outside shooting from players such as guards Durene Heisler 
and Whitney Meier. Heisler is averaging 18.7 points and has made 67% of her 
three-point attempts and Meier averages 18.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Sioux also have good size on their starting front line including 6-1 junior 
center Nadine Van De Kerckhove. 
</P>
<P>
The game will be the first-ever meeting between the schools and marks the first 
time that North Dakota has advanced to the quarterfinals. In fact, North 
Dakota's two playoff wins last week were the first in school history. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a season of firsts for the Muir High School girls basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Mustangs captured their first CIF Southern Section title 
with a 56-49 victory over Ventura in the 4-AA Division championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Muir won the Southern California regional title for the first time 
with a 43-38 decision over Point Loma in the Division II final. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs hope to cap the season by winning their first state championship 
against San Ramon of Danville at 1:15 p.m. Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Muir will take a 29-5 record into the game, which will mark the first 
appearance in the state final for the Mustangs. San Ramon, which defeated 
Moreau of Hayward by a 59-51 score in the Northern California regional final 
last week, also has a 29-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, who also defeated San Pasqual (56-39) and Ventura (58-44) in 
regional play before playing Pt. Loma, will have a size advantage against San 
Ramon. 
</P>
<P>
Muir's front line includes seniors Melinda Armstrong (6-1) and Karin Banks 
(5-10) at forward and Josie Pacheco (6-0) at center. Armstrong is the team's 
scoring leader, averaging 14 points and 7.9 rebounds, and Banks averages 13.5 
points and 5.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Mustangs also have an outstanding floor leader in point guard 
Rose Jong. The 5-2 senior averages 10.1 points and 10.1 assists and may have 
saved her best game for the regional final, when she scored 23 points including 
two three-pointers.

WILL SPORTS REALLY PAY OFF IN O.C.'S ECONOMIC ARENA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who would bring professional basketball and hockey teams to Orange County 
paint a rosy picture of prosperity, projecting a great boost to the local 
economy generated by the teams and a new indoor sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
But many economists say sports franchises and indoor arenas do not necessarily 
result in an economic boon. 
</P>
<P>
"That seems to be a matter of debate that hasn't been resolved yet," said 
Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim. 
</P>
<P>
As Anaheim and Santa Ana, Orange County's two largest cities, race to be the 
first in the county to build a modern arena that can attract a big-name 
professional sports franchise, there is easy talk of millions of dollars in new 
revenue. But Baim and others raise some flags of caution. 
</P>
<P>
There is some evidence that when a professional sports team moves to a city it 
boosts local employment, Baim notes, but there also is ample evidence to the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
"There is validity to the argument that a new facility diverts entertainment 
money rather than generating more spending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim and Santa Ana have pledged public subsidies for their proposed arenas. 
To justify using taxpayers' money, city officials say their local economies 
will greatly benefit. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, an National Basketball Assn. team playing in a new arena would mean 
$78.9 million new annual sales for the area economy, according to a financial 
study for the city by the firm Laventhol &amp; Horwath and the arena's 
developer, Ogden Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The economic benefits of the Anaheim arena assume "favorable estimates of 
financial performance," the Laventhol &amp; Horwath report said. For example, 
it is assumed that an NBA or Major Indoor Soccer League team would have 
attendance equal to or above the league average. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, an indoor arena's economic benefits would amount to $69 million a 
year, according to a study by Economic Research Associates on behalf of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"When a worker is paid to work on this (arena) project he will take the money 
and spend most or all of it on other goods and services," the study says. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is another point of view, Baim says. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies have found that a new sports facility simply draws customers who 
would otherwise spend their money on something else in the same community. The 
reasoning is that there is a limited amount of disposable income in any area 
for entertainment purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In six separate studies since 1987, Robert Baade, professor of economics at 
Lake Forest College in Illinois, found in most cases there is no change in key 
economic indicators when a sports facility is added or renovated in a 
community, or when a professional sports franchise moves to town. Among the 
cities he studied were San Diego, Tampa Bay, Seattle, New Orleans and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Baade also found a "lower rate of economic growth in cities that adopt a 
sports-development strategy than (in cities with) development growth of other 
sorts." 
</P>
<P>
Baim said studies such as Baade's reason that cities boosting sports are " . . 
. taking investment dollars away from perhaps more lucrative ventures . . . and 
generating only service industry-type jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"You are taking someone who could be doing something else and now he's throwing 
peanuts, literally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baim does not necessarily agree with that view. But in his study of 14 sports 
facilities, Baim found that only one -- Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium -- 
generated a positive cash flow to local government. The cumulative drain of all 
14 facilities on the public purse was $136 million. Among the sports facilities 
studied were Anaheim Stadium, San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and the 
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum and Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Most studies on the economic effect of sports franchises are self-serving, done 
to bolster arguments in favor of or opposed to building arenas and stadiums, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are usually produced by people with an interest in how they come out," 
Baim said. "They stack the assumptions as much in favor of the desired outcome 
as possible. They work with multipliers that are unrealistic or assumptions 
that no new money would be generated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really like nailing Jell-O to a wall." 
</P>
<P>
When an economic study forecasted a $1.4-billion gain for the Sacramento 
economy over 30 years if the Los Angeles Raiders moved there, Thomas W. 
Hazlett, who teaches economics and public policy at UC Davis, said it wasn't 
worth "the Raiders' deposit slip it's written on." 
</P>
<P>
"The assumptions," Hazlett wrote in September, 1989, in the Wall Street 
Journal, "were so optimistic as to make Rosy Scenario blush -- for instance, 
that the Sacramento Raiders will sell more tickets at 30% higher prices than 
the San Francisco 49ers. . . . Most important, it is simply posited that no 
dollar spent on Raiders football would ever otherwise be spent in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Baim said his studies tend to look at the raw numbers of people employed. They 
indicate that when "a team shows up, it seems to be related to an increase in 
employment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are less tangible effects of having a sports franchise in town, Baim 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the perception that the city is now a major-league city," he said, 
which "tends to attract businesses." 
</P>
<P>
But Baim said there also seems to be a "darker side. Crime seems to go up." 
</P>
<P>
Cities with between 750,000 and 2 million population with sports facilities 
were found to have "statistically significant" higher incidences of crime than 
those without similar facilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The conventional argument is a team can serve as a model for youngsters to 
learn fair play and how to play by rules," he said. "But it seems maybe just to 
work the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said the city's arena will increase the 
demands on his department. 
</P>
<P>
"Professional basketball and other major sporting events invariably lead to a 
high degree of emotional fan involvement," Molloy said in the city's arena 
environmental impact report. "More frequently than ever before the actions by 
some fans require police intervention." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Molloy said, additional police services must be funded if 
Anaheim's arena is built. 
</P>
<P>
Business owners in the vicinity of Santa Ana's proposed arena have voiced 
similar concerns, claiming the facility would depress property values by 
promoting drug dealing, drunken brawls and other disturbances at rock concerts 
to be held there. 
</P>
<P>
Another significant cost factor is the often underestimated price of 
construction, Baim said. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation of Yankee Stadium in New York, originally estimated at $21 
million, ended up costing more than $100 million. Construction costs for the 
New Orleans Superdome were estimated at $15 million to $20 million and came in 
closer to $150 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This week Anaheim officials disclosed that construction bids for a 20,000-seat 
indoor arena there, originally thought to cost $85 million, have come in at $94 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential cost to taxpayers is the relatively new phenomenon of the 
"franchise fee," a lump sum paid to a team as inducement to move the club to a 
new venue. In successfully wooing the Raiders back to Oakland, city officials 
agreed this week to meet owner Al Davis' demand for a $53.5-million fee. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim City Manager James Ruth flatly rejects any possibility that the city 
would pay a franchise fee to lure a sports team to its proposed arena. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Ogden Corp., the Anaheim Arena developer, has no intention of paying 
such a fee, according to Marie Monet, president of Ogden Financial Services, a 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
If such a fee were demanded, it would be paid by the group of as-yet 
undisclosed private investors seeking a franchise for Anaheim, Monet said. "The 
same group prepared to purchase the team. Not the city, not Ogden." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Spectacor Management Group, which plans to operate the Santa 
Ana Arena, said neither his firm nor the city would pay any franchise fee. The 
fee would be paid by the ownership group that buys or moves the franchise, he 
said.

SADDLEBACK, CAL STATE SYSTEM WOULD SHARE PROPOSED CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In what would be the first project of is kind in the state, Saddleback 
Community College District officials have proposed building a campus to be 
shared by students from the community college and the California State 
University system. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Sneed, chancellor of the community college district, has submitted a 
report to the state community college chancellor outlining a partnership in 
which a 400- to 700-acre joint campus would be constructed in fast-growing 
South County. Sneed said in an interview this week that he hopes that the 
campus will open by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say pairing the two college systems would save millions of dollars in 
construction costs and help community college students transferring to a Cal 
State university. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes good economic sense," Sneed said, "and good educational sense." 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said he has been discussing the campus with Cal State officials for more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"For this to be in place by 2000, we have to start in 1990," Sneed said. "We 
can't wait until 1998." 
</P>
<P>
By 2000, South County's population will have almost doubled, from 500,000 to 
almost 900,000, Sneed said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
Escalating real estate costs and "the continuing growth of South Orange County 
. . . make it imperative" that land for the campus be found in the near future, 
Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State University administrators have praised the concept of a joint campus, 
but are approaching the idea cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a tremendous thing," said George Giacumakis, director of 
the Cal State Fullerton satellite campus that opened last fall at Saddleback 
College. "The cooperative system is very healthy. We've seen it work in our 
satellite campuses." 
</P>
<P>
Under Sneed's proposal, the Cal State University system would only offer upper 
division and graduate-level courses on the campus. Lower division courses would 
be managed by the community college. 
</P>
<P>
The savings from sharing a campus "would be immense," Giacumakis said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction costs at the Cal State San Marcos facility being built near 
Escondido will run about $600 million, said Rob Snyder, physical planning 
director for the university. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing a campus would save about $150 million in construction costs for 
parking, a library, a cafeteria and maintenance facilities, Snyder estimated. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan presents some difficulties for the Cal State system, Giacumakis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first would be the loss of revenue from freshman and sophomore students, 
who provide the bulk of income for four-year universities, Giacumakis said. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said legislation would have to be enacted to provide special funding for 
a college offering only upper-division courses. 
</P>
<P>
Giacumakis said some university officials may be intimidated by the 
joint-campus proposal because "this has never been done before in the state." 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, our satellite campus is here today because we pushed and 
pushed for it," Giacumakis said. The dual campus "can be done. I think there is 
a lot of potential for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said he is talking with Santa Margarita Co. officials about using a 
portion of Rancho Mission Viejo for the proposed new campus. The 40,000-acre 
ranch is one of the largest pieces of undeveloped land left in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We get an amazing number of propositions for our land," said company 
spokeswoman Diane Gaynor. "Whether or not anything will happen is purely 
speculation because no offer has been made." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a joint campus has also intrigued some state education experts. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind it makes a lot of sense," said Kenneth O'Brien, executive 
director of the California Post-Secondary Education Commission, a state group 
that reports to the governor's office on educational projects. "If plans for 
this were to reach our office, we'd probably look very kindly at it." 
</P>
<P>
Even if plans for the joint campus never leave the drawing board, Sneed intends 
to lobby for a third South County community college for the district that now 
includes Saddleback College and Irvine Valley College.

"The Saddleback Community College District needs a third college before the 
year 2005 and desperately needs to acquire a site while land is still 
available," Sneed's report said. "There is no community college for 37 miles 
between Mission Viejo and Oceanside. That clearly demonstrates the need for 
another community college in South County."

SPRAYING IS THE ONLY WAY, MEDFLY PANEL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
INFESTATION: SCIENTISTS ADVISE AGAINST ATTEMPT TO USE STERILE FLIES IN L.A. AND 
ORANGE COUNTIES BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH AVAILABLE.

Scientists advising the state in its campaign to eradicate the Mediterranean 
fruit fly in Southern California said Wednesday that aerial spraying of 
pesticides remains the only viable weapon available to treat most of the 
infested area. 
</P>
<P>
The five scientists told a press conference that a shortage of sterile fruit 
flies -- which had been viewed as the only feasible alternative to pesticide 
spraying -- has led them to recommend against changing tactics. 
</P>
<P>
They said that as more sterile flies become available from two new breeding 
facilities in Hawaii they should be held in reserve against future infestation, 
or used to bolster the eradication effort in Whittier, where the use of sterile 
flies has continued throughout the regional infestation. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's recommendation must still be approved by the director of the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture and a decision is expected by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that program impetus and effectiveness will suffer an unwarranted 
setback with a change so near to the conclusion of the campaign," the 
scientists stated in their recommendation. "Therefore, we are not recommending 
the phase-in of a sterile fly program in any of the bait treatment areas." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the scientists optimistically noted that the spraying -- 
which has sparked protests from residents, politicians and environmentalists -- 
appears to be working and the 8-month-old infestation could be eliminated by 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The outcry from the public over aerial spraying has steadily increased over the 
last two months, although Gov. George Deukmejian and agriculture officials have 
remained resolute in backing the spraying program to eradicate the 
crop-destroying pest. 
</P>
<P>
To ease anxieties about the extent of the spraying, agriculture officials have 
been promising for weeks that the two facilities in Hawaii could produce enough 
sterile flies by May to begin phasing out areas being treated with malathion. 
</P>
<P>
But a majority of the science advisory panel said they doubted that a supply 
sufficient to breed the wild flies out of existence would be available by then. 
They predicted that it would probably be midsummer before the facilities are up 
to speed. 
</P>
<P>
Panel chairman Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture entomologist, 
said production problems with the one operating facility in Hawaii already have 
resulted in a decreased supply of sterile flies to the Whittier area. The state 
is temporarily making up the shortfall with sterile flies from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, however, said withholding the sterile flies from the spray zones 
will have a limited effect because spraying is scheduled to stop in most areas 
by the end of May if no new flies are found. Only the Pomona and Irwindale 
areas have spraying scheduled into June. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also recommended that, beginning in April, spraying be stepped up in 
all areas from once every three weeks to once every seven to 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said the expected warmer temperatures will make the fly more active 
and require a faster spraying schedule. Agriculture officials had previously 
announced that spraying would be increased in April. 
</P>
<P>
The one scientist who was more reserved in his assessment of the eradication 
program's progress was James R. Carey, an entomology professor at UC Davis. He 
said he was "cautiously optimistic" about the program, but concerned that there 
will be more outbreaks outside the current treatment areas. 
</P>
<P>
Carey testified before the state Assembly last week that, because of repeated 
infestations in several areas such as Culver City and Baldwin Park, he believes 
the pest has become firmly established in parts of Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of panel members disagree with Carey's statements. But to put the 
issue to rest, the panel recommended a potentially costly and time-consuming 
program of saturation trapping to determine if small populations of Medflies 
have managed to elude detection over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the typical five traps per square mile, the new program would 
involve thousands of additional traps that would have to be monitored for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a definite major first step," Carey said. "I see no other way to get at 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a request by the state attorney general's office for a temporary 
restraining order preventing the cities of Pasadena, Azusa and Lynwood from 
enforcing local ordinances against low-flying helicopters used in the malathion 
spraying was switched to U.S. District Court on Wednesday at the insistence of 
attorneys representing the cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we'll stand a better chance in federal court," said Lynwood Mayor 
Robert Henning after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dzintra I. Janavs' 
decision not to rule on the matter because the case had been filed in the 
higher court. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the action "an obstruction," Deputy Atty. Gen. Charles Getz said that 
the state would consider its options for a few days before deciding what to do. 
The state's position, Getz said, is based on the belief that federal and state 
law supersedes a city's jurisdiction over air traffic within its borders.

FOR TRAFFIC ENGINEERS, A BALANCING ACT; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUTING: THEY DEAL WITH THE LITTLE THINGS -- SIGNALS, SIGNS, TURN LANES -- 
THAT KEEP THE CITY MOVING.

Commuters inched forward, part of a mile-long backup. Several drivers 
jerk-stopped their cars, too late to slip through the green light. One 
frustrated motorist in a pickup truck cut off a car, and the two drivers 
exchanged obscene gestures. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a gas station operator grumbled that business was down. A traffic 
officer proclaimed that ticket-writing was up. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the commotion at the intersection of Victory and Sepulveda boulevards last 
week, there stood soft-spoken Eleanor Pui Ng, stopwatch and clipboard in hand, 
preparing to tinker once more with the commutes of the 65,666 motorists who 
pass through the intersection each day. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when horn-honking, fist-flailing traffic woes are a prime producer of 
complaints all over Los Angeles, Pui Ng is a member of a little-known but 
influential cadre of Los Angeles city traffic engineers who quietly spill onto 
the roadways each workday on a sometimes futile, occasionally victorious, 
mission to fix troubled streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if I take two more seconds from Sepulveda it will help Victory," Pui Ng 
said, eyeing the traffic-signal timer. "Maybe 2 1/2 seconds. You know, 
sometimes this can be very delicate. A few seconds can screw everything up." 
</P>
<P>
The traffic engineer's judgment can alter the length of the backup on major 
avenues, the safety of an intersection and the profits of a business. Some 
residents, desperate for traffic improvements, plead with engineers for relief 
because their lifestyles, even their lives, are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"I take my life in my own hands when I make a turn," wrote one resident who 
lives near Mulholland Drive. "We must have a left-turn arrow." 
</P>
<P>
"Customers can't reach us because the alley is blocked off," said David Lynch, 
operator of a drive-through hot dog stand, asking engineers to settle a dispute 
between competing restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of similar complaints create the traffic engineer's raison d'etre, 
officials said. Although the complaint-line telephone number is not publicized 
like a hot line, scores of residents have managed to find it, creating a 
citywide backlog of about 16,000 complaints that would take more than a year to 
work through, said Ed Rowe, general manager of the Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
While high-level transportation officials handle decisions on mammoth traffic 
improvement projects -- such as subway construction, selection of rail routes 
and the installation of a multimillion-dollar traffic-signal synchronization 
program -- traffic engineers most often deal in minutiae: stop signs, red curb 
zones, left-turn arrows, median stripes and timing of traffic lights. 
</P>
<P>
In their work, they have found that the popularity of the simple street sign 
cannot be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, nearly 5,000 Los Angeles residents requested new street signs. About 
5,700 more wanted some type of new pavement marking and about 2,000 residents 
requested new traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
And they all seem to want their signs, markings and signals now. 
</P>
<P>
"We carry the brunt of a lot of frustrations. Some people come to us truly 
belligerent about things," said Thomas Jones, a senior transportation engineer. 
"There is only so much we can do to make traffic flow better. I can't promise a 
miracle, but we can do some good things." 
</P>
<P>
What people have trouble understanding is that raising a street sign is a 
complicated task. Switching on a five-second left-turn arrow can bring on a 
mile-long backup. Car-count surveys, geometric designs, "pedestrian-seconds" 
and signal cycles must be considered before any new street device is installed. 
</P>
<P>
Few locales offer such a fine example of a traffic mess as the intersection of 
Victory and Sepulveda boulevards in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
For months, residents in a four-block neighborhood southwest of the 
intersection pleaded with the city to stop what many described as the selfish 
practice of speeding commuters who turned right off of Victory to take a 
shortcut through their streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bedlam out there," said Orion Street resident Kathleen Freeman. "There 
is no reason for a neighborhood to be destroyed so that someone can get to a 
job 10 minutes faster." 
</P>
<P>
The residents demanded that traffic engineers install a "No Right Turn" sign. 
</P>
<P>
But first, the city had to investigate. Was there really bedlam on Orion 
Street? A device was laid on the road to count the number of cars. The 
calculator tabulated more than 800 vehicles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty much," Pui Ng said. 
</P>
<P>
Up went several "No Right Turn" signs to prevent motorists from turning before 
the major intersection at Victory. A right-turn lane was added on Victory to 
accommodate the 800 cars back on the boulevard each hour. A new right-turn 
arrow was added to help the 800 cars make it around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The result? 
</P>
<P>
Smiling residents. Scowling commuters. One grumbling gas station manager who 
said business has dropped about 10% because customers can't turn right into his 
station. And a six- to 13-minute delay eastbound on Victory Boulevard that on a 
bad day creates a 1 1/2-mile backup. 
</P>
<P>
Pui Ng figures that she can steal two, maybe 2 1/2 more seconds from Sepulveda 
commuters so that two more cars on Victory can traverse the intersection each 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
If she took half a second more, the average pedestrian, who walks four feet per 
second, would not have enough time to cross Victory Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"This intersection was like a suitcase that had been stuffed as tight as it 
can," Pui Ng said. "Then someone wanted to put a pair of shoes in because it 
would be nice. Now you see what's happening, the whole thing is bulging." 
</P>
<P>
To prevent the suitcase from bursting open and spilling its contents back onto 
Orion Street, Los Angeles police officers are ticketing "No Right Turn" 
scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the intersection of Sepulveda and Victory is an exceptional case, 
traffic engineer Gerald Tom explained as he drove to Pickford Street and 
Spaulding Avenue in the Mid-City area to make a critical, though less complex, 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't justify a stop sign at this intersection. There are no blind 
spots and only light traffic," Tom said, reviewing a 40-signature petition from 
nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
The residents wrote that they need a stop sign to "curb excessive speeds which 
create lethal conditions." Tom plans to respond that a stop sign is not 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Tom's next stop was at the beleaguered intersection of Rodeo Road and La 
Cienega Boulevard near Baldwin Hills. One nearby resident is fed up with the 
time it takes to make a left turn onto La Cienega. He is demanding a green 
left-turn arrow. 
</P>
<P>
What the resident doesn't know is that a left-turn arrow would be likely to 
anger 43,361 of his fellow commuters. They would be trapped in a "big mess" 
because the little five-second green arrow means that every other car has to 
wait longer for its turn, Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no magic solution," Tom said. "An arrow would just jam everything 
up." 
</P>
<P>
On a quieter road, along the 12300 block of Laurel Terrace Drive in Studio 
City, Myrtle Jones, 82, has detected a traffic dilemma from her bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just awful what I see," said Jones, who uses a wheelchair and passes much 
of her time reading near her window. "I see (drivers) cross over that median 
line every day. They have taken down the lamppost and the hydrant." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic engineer Rolando Buensalida watched almost every motorist speed over 
the double yellow line. He measured. He sketched out street stripes. He became 
confused. 
</P>
<P>
This was a case for the Geometric Design Team, Buensalida concluded. Traffic 
experts on the team use mathematical formulas to determine the configuration of 
yellow stripe lines. 
</P>
<P>
At his West San Fernando Valley office, Transportation Engineer Raymond H. 
Wellbaum grappled with what promises to be the next project of 
Sepulveda-Victory magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
He points to a stack of letters from Tarzana and Encino residents and repeats a 
familiar lament: "They are unhappy because traffic is clogging their 
neighborhood." Motorists are avoiding congested Sepulveda Pass on the San Diego 
Freeway via hillside shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
As Wellbaum studied a map of Ventura Boulevard, the Valley's notoriously 
congested thoroughfare, he began to mumble in traffic engineer-speak: road 
capacity, peak-hour restrictions, signal cycles. 
</P>
<P>
A traffic engineer "can only deal with what's physically there and operate the 
best he can," Wellbaum said, walking away from the map of troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Wellbaum said, he will attempt "to balance the needs of the 
neighbors against the needs of commuters." His determination resembles the 
spirit of the cartoon near his desk that reads, "Your traffic engineer is 
always ready to get you out of a jam." 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the picture above the caption depicts a hopelessly gridlocked 
intersection.

VOTERS MIGHT HAVE LAST SAY ON RAIDERS' RETURN HOME 
</P>

<P>
Oakland city officials sought Wednesday to squelch efforts to organize a 
popular referendum on the $660-million offer to the Los Angeles Raiders to move 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Jayne Williams said the City Council had acted "administratively" 
Monday night when it approved the proposed deal, and not "legislatively." 
Therefore, Williams said in a legal opinion, opponents of the project could not 
petition for a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Russo, a former Alameda County Democratic Party chairman who has been 
exploring the possibility of securing the 19,000 petition signatures necessary 
to force a referendum, promptly said he would challenge Williams' reasoning. 
Williams said the matter could end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
As opposition to the Raiders offer boiled in Oakland, where a recent poll 
indicated that 59% of residents viewed soliciting the Raiders' return as "not 
important," Gov. George Deukmejian told a press conference in Sacramento, "I 
just hope that the city of Oakland doesn't have any requests for any state 
funding coming along." 
</P>
<P>
He was suggesting that if Oakland can afford such an expensive deal to attract 
the Raiders, it does not need state help in other areas. When asked if he was 
serious and would look unfavorably on any future requests for money from 
Oakland or Alameda County , the governor paused and then declared firmly, "You 
got it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley said he has been "driven by optimism" 
all his life and so still harbors hope the Raiders deal with Oakland may fall 
through. But, Bradley added, he is also a realist, so he plans to meet today 
with his Committee to Support Professional Football to discuss organizing a 
drive to secure a new team. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he suspects that it might only take 10 or 12 days for Oakland to 
sign a final agreement with the Raiders, but he also noted that team owner Al 
Davis had once vowed to move to Irwindale and also talked of moving to 
Sacramento, only to adopt other alternatives. "It's not over until it's 
signed," the mayor said.

A preliminary order issued Wednesday by the state Court of Appeal appears to 
support a controversial order by City Clerk Mary E. Wynn setting forth details 
of the April 10 City Council election, according to Wynn's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn's order last week followed a Superior Court judge's denial of her request 
to order two council members to approve polling places and precinct workers for 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen John Kelly and Earl J. Prescott, who oppose the April election, 
voted against the resolution and have questioned Wynn's authority to issue the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
But in a preliminary ruling Wednesday, the appeals court cited an Election Code 
provision that if precinct board members have not been appointed, the city 
clerk shall appoint them. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn's attorney, Robert Owen, said the ruling appears to give the city clerk 
the authority to proceed with the election. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott and Kelly, who contest the legality of the ordinance moving city 
elections from November to April, have until Tuesday to respond to Wynn's 
appeal of the Superior Court decision. SHANNON SANDS

CHANGES SOUGHT IN PROPOSED DOG LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consideration of a proposed ordinance on vicious dogs has been delayed two 
weeks after the City Council requested several modifications. 
</P>
<P>
Among the requested changes was that the law include a requirement that the 
owner of a dog declared potentially dangerous or vicious maintain homeowners or 
general liability insurance for at least $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, which was presented by the city attorney, a dog would be 
classified as potentially dangerous or vicious by a three-member commission 
appointed by the council. The commission would also have the authority to order 
a vicious dog destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The push for stricter dog laws came as the result of the Feb. 2 dog attack on 
6-year-old Jeffrey Kerley, who was mauled by two 100-pound Rottweilers as he 
played near his home in the 7700 block of 19th Street. He received 75 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey's father, Noble Kerley, attended Tuesday's City Council meeting and 
said he was satisfied with the city's proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"The ordinance looks pretty good, pretty clean," Kerley said. "It's too late to 
help my son, but maybe it will help other victims in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The council will vote on the revised ordinance at a March 27 meeting.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL TO HELP SCHOOLS RELIEVE 
OVERCROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has voted unanimously to help officials of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District solve the district's growing overcrowding 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed Tuesday to set up a joint committee with the district after 
hearing Board of Education President Jackie Goldberg call for an end to the 
"historic separation between our decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
The committee will look into ways that the two governing bodies can work 
together to find new school sites, replace housing lost to new schools, plan 
for future enrollment and lobby in Sacramento. Goldberg said it is important 
for the council to consider school needs when deciding zoning and planning 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members applauded Goldberg's efforts. Overcrowding in the 
schools "is a critical, critical problem. . . . We have only seen the tip of 
the iceberg on this problem," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said.

In a move expected to snarl traffic in Santa Ana and Tustin, a pair of bridges 
will be demolished in late spring to make way for a widening of the Costa Mesa 
and Santa Ana freeways, state Transportation Department officials announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two 4th Street bridges crossing the freeways will be removed by June and 
wider overpasses will be erected, a process that should take more than a year, 
Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Hecker, Caltrans traffic management chief in Orange County, said the 
"traffic impacts will be large." Much of the traffic will be funneled onto 1st 
Street, where bridges over the two freeways are slated to be demolished and 
rebuilt as soon as the 4th Street work is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Hecker said that brochures will be sent to 100,000 nearby residents outlining 
the project and that a second radio transmitter will be installed to offer 
information to freeway drivers about traffic delays caused by the work. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, Hecker said, efforts have been made to improve alternative 
surface streets and upgrade traffic signals to accommodate automobiles diverted 
by the construction project. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from rebuilding the bridges, Caltrans has secured funding to widen the 
eight-lane Costa Mesa Freeway to 12 lanes between the Santa Ana Freeway and 
17th Street, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge work is just the start of an effort to rebuild nearly every overpass 
along the Santa Ana Freeway to allow its widening to 10 general-use lanes, two 
car-pool lanes and an elevated thoroughfare for buses and car pools. 
</P>
<P>
But state transportation officials said much of that work will be delayed 
indefinitely unless new funding sources are available, in particular the 
gas-tax increase on the state ballot in June. 
</P>
<P>
Among the projects in jeopardy is the rebuilding of the tightly knotted 
interchange of the Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Orange freeways. If the gas-tax 
measure is approved by state voters, the interchange reconstruction is expected 
to begin in August, 1991 and be concluded in early 1996, Caltrans officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith McKean, Orange County district director, said much of the department's 
budget and attention has been shifted of late to retrofitting bridges up and 
down the state since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake in the Bay Area last October.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MUD HENS TO BE SHOT TO CURB OVERPOPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Wednesday ordered the shooting of about 175 mud hens at Legg Lake 
near South El Monte as part of an ongoing effort to control overpopulation of 
the birds, also known as coots, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The marsh-living birds are destroying fragile plant life and leaving messy 
droppings all around the lake in the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area, an aide 
to Supervisor Pete Schabarum said. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Hammond said Schabarum had received numerous complaints about the coots 
from residents before requesting that agricultural officials destroy some of 
the birds. "Unfortunately, shooting is the only way to bring them under 
control," she said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have shot mud hens at the lake on several occasions, as well 
as at Frank G. Bonelli Regional County Park in San Dimas and at Santa Fe Dam 
Park in Irwindale, Hammond said. The state Fish and Game Department has 
authorized the shootings, she said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL SUPPORTS VALLEY LIGHT-RAIL 
LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three-member Los Angeles City Council Transportation Committee agreed 
Wednesday to endorse a San Fernando Valley rail line over two other proposed 
lines elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The three council members, each of whom had previously declared their support 
for extending the downtown Metro Rail subway 5.6 miles west from North 
Hollywood, voted to recommend that the full council adopt the same position 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Rival projects are a downtown-to-Pasadena light-rail line and a northward 
extension of the Century Freeway light-rail line from El Segundo to Marina del 
Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, the committee chairman, predicted that the full council 
will "easily pass" the Valley plan and send it on to the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, which has the final say.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
CITYHOOD SUPPORTERS SAY SIGNS LOOK GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of an effort to create Orange County's 30th city in the Laguna Hills 
area announced this week that they have collected enough signatures to place 
the issue on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions call for the creation of an eight-square-mile city bounded by 
Irvine, El Toro, Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel and Aliso Viejo. Ellen Martin, 
head of Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, said the group has collected more than 
4,200 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
At least 3,750 signatures, 25% of the area's registered voters, were needed to 
qualify the measure for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really doorstep democracy," Martin said. "It's been terrific. The 
morale (among workers) is very high. We are getting such great support when we 
meet people at the door." 
</P>
<P>
Citizens to Save Laguna Hills still needs to await completion of a financial 
feasibility report by a consultant before the organization can take its 
application to the Local Agency Formation Commission. The study will be paid 
for by donations collected by pro-cityhood forces in the Laguna Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary study showed that the proposed city of Laguna Hills, anchored by 
sales tax revenue from the Laguna Hills Mall, would have a $3-million to 
$4-million budget surplus in the first year of operation, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin expects to submit the application by the end of March and hopes to have 
a LAFCO hearing scheduled for late April. The Board of Supervisors is also 
required to hear the application before a ballot measure is approved for the 
Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
The latest attempt to create a city of Laguna Hills in June failed by 284 votes 
due to strong opposition from Leisure World residents. The new proposed city 
boundaries will not include the sprawling retirement community, but a 
homeowners group in Aliso Viejo is opposed to cityhood because a portion of 
that planned community would become part of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cityhood proponents in nearby El Toro have released a completed 
financial feasibility study that shows a proposed 21-square-mile city composed 
of three communities would have a $2.3-million surplus in its first full year 
of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Wilson, head of Community Coalition for Incorporation, said the 
feasibility report confirms the group's longtime claim that a city composed of 
El Toro, Lake Forest, Portola Hills and the undeveloped Foothill Ranch would be 
financially secure. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also said her group has gathered half the 8,000 signatures needed to 
place the issue on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of residents turned out Tuesday night to hear a presentation on the 
viability of the proposed city. Cityhood advocate Ron Benjamin told the 
homeowners gathered at the Lake Forest Sun and Sail Club that cityhood will 
protect the community from unwanted development. 
</P>
<P>
"We have what I see is a serious risk to the quality of our lives," said 
Benjamin, an El Toro resident. "We need a real solid community identity." JAMES

DISNEYLAND GIVES LESSON IN REAL LIFE

Mark Melo had never thought about the serious side of Disneyland until 
Wednesday, when he and 40 other high school seniors got a chance to look at the 
not-so-glamorous side of operating the 35-year-old amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
For the last seven years, Disneyland has sponsored "Work Exposure," a one-day 
program designed to introduce high school students to the real world of 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew so much went into operating the park," said Melo, 16, a senior at 
Kennedy High School. "I've always had an interest in marketing, and being a 
part of this has shown me how broad an area marketing covers." 
</P>
<P>
Participants were chosen by the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce based on academic 
standings (none has less than a 3.5 average) and community activities. 
Applicants also were asked to name three Disneyland departments where they 
might be interested in working. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really just interested in giving the students an opportunity to see 
what it is like to actually do the job they feel they might want to do," said 
Lorine Schoeman, of Disneyland's employee relations department. 
</P>
<P>
Students met with Ron Dominguez, vice president of Disneyland, over breakfast 
before dispersing to 11 different departments in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We choose students with high grades to reward them for their hard work and 
also match them with employees here who have shown exemplary work," Schoeman 
said. "So we really are rewarding both of the people directly involved." 
</P>
<P>
Rene Bardeau, a photographer for 30 years with Disneyland, said, "I get real 
satisfaction from taking a student around for the day. I wish something like 
this was available when I was in school so I could have seen firsthand what 
it's really like out here." 
</P>
<P>
Schoeman added that the "Work Exposure" program has been so successful that 
many of the students participating in the program have returned to work for 
Disneyland. ALLISON SAMUELS

DISSIDENT HOLLYWOOD RESIDENTS BLAMED FOR MELEE AT REDEVELOPMENT PANEL MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A bitter shouting match that touched off fistfighting at a North Hollywood 
citizens redevelopment meeting was provoked by "outside agitators" ousted from 
a Hollywood redevelopment group, North Hollywood community leaders charged 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several Hollywood residents, who were removed from a similar redevelopment 
advisory committee last spring for what Councilman Michael Woo said was "wacky 
behavior," had accused North Hollywood committee members of conducting an 
unfair election. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood contingent's attempt to videotape the contentious North Hollywood 
Redevelopment Project Area Committee election meeting Tuesday night set off 
fist-swinging clashes between the two groups, participants said. There were no 
serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Berlin, a law clerk representing the Hollywood dissidents, said his group 
was simply trying to advise its neighbors in North Hollywood, who, he said, 
"have no idea" what the powerful Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency "is 
really doing to their community." 
</P>
<P>
The group charged that the agency has failed to inform the community of its 
plans to carry out redevelopment in North Hollywood, an accusation that 
committee Chairwoman Ada Klevans called "absolutely ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
The ousted Hollywood committee members and a handful of North Hollywood 
residents charged that the 16-member citizen advisory committee is a "rubber 
stamp" for agency projects, and that last month's committee elections were 
illegally conducted, Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations infuriated some longtime members of the North Hollywood group, 
who said they have been meeting relatively peacefully for years to help 
revitalize their community. 
</P>
<P>
"These agitators have no place else to go, so they have moved to North 
Hollywood," Klevans said. "Frankly, we resent this intrusion." 
</P>
<P>
Arguments broke out over eligibility requirements for candidates for vacant 
positions on the citizens advisory committee. When a Hollywood resident tried 
to videotape an exchange by positioning his camera near the face of former 
North Hollywood committee member Guy McCreary, McCreary said he "pushed aside 
the camera." 
</P>
<P>
As the incident escalated into a shoving melee, the camera was knocked to the 
ground. Greg Roberts, an unsuccessful candidate for a seat on the committee, 
complained to police that he had been punched in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Ousted members of the Hollywood committee have been on the losing end of a 
bitter court battle with Los Angeles and Councilman Michael Woo for months. Woo 
disbanded the committee, naming new members, because he said it had become a 
forum for "wacky behavior" bent on undermining his Hollywood renewal effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really a rotten shame that these outsiders have come in to disrupt the 
North Hollywood committee," said Renee Weitzer, a deputy to Councilman John 
Ferraro, who represents North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The 740-acre North Hollywood redevelopment area is Los Angeles' only 
redevelopment zone in the San Fernando Valley and the third largest in the 
city, ranking behind the downtown central business district and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Several rundown commercial buildings along Lankershim Boulevard have been razed 
over the years with little community controversy, clearing the way for a major 
office complex. The highly touted $41-million Academy project, a cluster of 
offices and apartments so named because it will house the Academy of Television 
Arts and Sciences, is under construction.

HOMEOWNERS SUE TO PROTECT VIEWS

<P>
Eleven Dana Point property owners worried about losing their views of the 
valley and the ocean are suing the developer of a 71-unit housing tract across 
the street from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The landowners along Calle La Primavera in the southeast part of the city are 
charging fraud in suit filed in Orange County Superior Court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
They claim that representatives from Southwest Diversified Inc. of San 
Francisco had promised them that the homes in the project, called the Village 
at Dana Point, would not block views of the Capistrano Valley, the ocean and 
Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Darryl Jeffrey Paul, who is representing the homeowners in the suit, 
filed Tuesday, said, "The homeowners knew their first-story views would be 
affected, but were promised their second-story views would be saved." 
</P>
<P>
Paul R. Hamilton, the attorney for the developer, said the county approved the 
project before Dana Point was incorporated and that the developer followed all 
county regulations regarding height limitations for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the property owners will have their views blocked, Hamilton said, but 
"every one of those people knew when they bought their homes that there would 
be some blockage of their views." LEN HALL

3 DIE AS CAR IN CRASH PLUNGES OFF FREEWAY;

TRAFFIC: VEHICLE BURSTS INTO FLAME. FIVE WOULD-BE RESCUERS ARE INJURED.

Three people were killed and six others -- including three police officers and 
two motorists who tried to rescue the victims -- were injured when a 
two-vehicle crash on the Hollywood Freeway flung one car through a guardrail 
and 25 feet down onto a parking area Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which forced closure of three northbound lanes of the freeway 
near Vermont Avenue, tied up morning rush-hour traffic throughout downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The three who died were all occupants of a Toyota sedan that smashed through 
the guardrail and slammed onto the pavement of a storage facility under the 
freeway. Investigators said one of the victims apparently started to crawl free 
from the wreckage before the car, which teetered for a moment, rolled over on 
him and burst into flame. 
</P>
<P>
None of the dead were immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
The three Los Angeles police officers and two motorists who helped them in 
their frustrated attempts to save the occupants of the burning sedan were all 
treated for smoke inhalation and released. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in a pickup truck that collided with the sedan was treated for her 
injuries at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital and released. She was not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Brey said the crash apparently was caused 
by the driver of a third vehicle that left the scene after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"That vehicle made a sharp left to get on the freeway upon leaving the Vermont 
on-ramp," Brey said. "It forced the woman's (truck) to collide with the Toyota. 
A witness chased the unsafe-lane-change driver and was able to obtain a license 
number. We are attempting to find the registered owner of that car." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Sgt. Skip McOmber of the Police Department's Rampart Division had 
been headed north on the freeway about 6:20 a.m. when he happened onto the 
accident, which had just occurred. McOmber radioed for help. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists Brett Heisinger, 23, of Fullerton, and Aaron Jackson, 24, of South 
Pasadena, driving to work in separate vehicles, drove up about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the car go over the side and I stopped my truck," Heisinger said. "The 
policeman (McOmber) was right behind me. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him the car had just gone over the side," Heisinger said. "I could see 
it was just starting to burn. I thought maybe we could save whoever was inside, 
so I got a fire extinguisher from my truck and we ran 50 yards down the freeway 
to an embankment, went down that, climbed over a fence and started shooting 
that stuff on the car. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fire wouldn't go out," Heisinger continued. "So the police officer and 
I took a steel bar from the broken guardrail, wedged the bar under the burning 
car and lifted it. The other guy (Jackson) pulled a guy out from under the car 
as we lifted it." 
</P>
<P>
Heisinger said that at the time, "I never even thought about the fire, or that 
the car might explode. But after we got that guy out, the fire started going 
pretty good, and we had to back away." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Cornia Smith said she and her partner, Officer Josh Adler, were in 
their patrol car about two blocks away when they heard McOmber's radio call. 
</P>
<P>
"We got on an on-ramp and got up there as fast as we could, but the freeway 
traffic was all stopped," Smith said. "We couldn't drive through it, so we got 
out and ran through the traffic, jumped over the guardrail and ran down the 
embankment and across the street (Heliotrope Drive) to where the car had 
landed. It was still burning." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she and Adler tried to reach the car to rescue the two victims still 
trapped inside, "but there was so much smoke and flame we couldn't even see in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to blow up, and then it did." 
</P>
<P>
Realizing there was nothing more that could be done for those in the car, Smith 
said, she and her partner clambered back up onto the freeway, to see what could 
be done for the driver of the overturned pickup. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, the woman had gotten out of it by herself," Smith said. "She was 
dazed, confused. But she was out of the truck." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on downtown freeways and local surface streets was jammed for more than 
three hours as a result of the crash.

Parents and police in two beach cities were on alert and Hermosa Beach school 
officials prepared Wednesday to close a campus to outsiders after apparent 
kidnaping attempts against four schoolchildren in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are uncertain if the same man is responsible for the four 
separate incidents in Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach because the 
descriptions of the suspect differed slightly in each case. 
</P>
<P>
All four children, ranging in age from 7 to 14, escaped unharmed when a man 
approached them and asked them to take a ride in his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach police released three composite drawings after the three children 
who were approached in that city described the man. Police said they came up 
with different likenesses because more than one man could be responsible for 
the abduction attempts, the children might have given inaccurate descriptions 
or the man could have altered his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The three Hermosa Beach children and an 8-year-old girl from Manhattan Beach 
said the man who approached them was in his 20s or early 30s, about 6 feet tall 
and thin. His hair was variously described as red, blond and brown. Three of 
the children said the man had a mustache, while one said he was clean-shaven. 
Two children said the man drove a red pickup, while two said the truck was 
white. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we are dealing with one person or more than one," said Hermosa 
Beach Police Cmdr. John Mebius. 
</P>
<P>
On March 7, the 8-year-old Manhattan Beach girl was walking to Pacific 
Elementary School when a man called to her from his white pickup truck, police 
said. As she walked by, the man opened his door and appeared to be masturbating 
inside, Sgt. Jack Zea said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, a man driving a red pickup pulled alongside and tried to speak 
to a 10-year-old boy walking home from Hermosa Valley School, said Hermosa 
Beach Police Sgt. Spike Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a man walked onto the playground at the same school and told a 
7-year-old girl that her mother wanted her to ride home with him. 
</P>
<P>
And on Tuesday, a 14-year-old boy told police that he was walking home from 
Mira Costa High School when a red pickup truck pulled up and the driver told 
him to get in. 
</P>
<P>
In all four cases, the children ran off and reported the incidents to their 
parents or school officials. 
</P>
<P>
More parents have been escorting their children to school this week, school 
officials said. Police said they plan to have plainclothes officers patrol 
around schools in both cities. At Tuesday's City Council meeting, Hermosa Beach 
Mayor Roger Creighton called on citizens to be extra vigilant. And Wednesday 
night, the Hermosa Beach school board was expected to close Hermosa Valley 
School to everyone but students, teachers and visitors with passes. The campus 
had been open to provide residents access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know everybody walking across campus," said Principal Shalee 
Cunningham. "We feel we need to close the campus to make security 100% 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
The school has sent out two notices alerting parents to the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Police said these precautions and the safety training that students receive in 
school have paid off. "These kids are great," Mebius said. "They did exactly 
the right thing. When they were accosted, they ran."

BUS PASSENGER GETS TRIP TO POLICE STATION AFTER JOY RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A passenger on a Santa Monica city bus decided to take it for a joy ride 
Wednesday, driving through the city for 15 minutes before parking and going 
into a restaurant, where he was arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Three other passengers were on the bus at 4th Street and Broadway in Santa 
Monica when the 45-year-old man jumped into the driver's seat at 7:30 p.m. 
after the regular driver left the bus for undetermined reasons, Sgt. George 
Cortwright said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who refused to give police his name, drove several blocks, hit a 
parked car, and continued to Pico and Centinela boulevards, where he parked the 
bus with the engine running. One passenger followed him into a nearby 
restaurant where two California Highway Patrol officers and a Los Angeles 
police officer were eating, Cortwright said. The passenger told the officers 
what had happened, and they arrested the man for investigation of grand theft 
auto and kidnaping.

POLICE SEIZE 3 SUSPECTS IN FORGERY RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA CHONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of its biggest seizures involving counterfeit identification, Los 
Angeles police have arrested three suspects in what they described as a 
statewide forgery ring that may have stolen more than $2 million from Los 
Angeles-area banks. 
</P>
<P>
Police had made earlier arrests in the case, but Wednesday was the first time 
they were able to locate so many of the bogus documents allegedly used in the 
scam and the equipment used to produce them, officials said. At four Los 
Angeles County homes -- in Lennox, Hawthorne, the Wilshire district and 
southwestern Los Angeles -- authorities found thousands of stolen and 
counterfeit identification cards, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very, very sophisticated, effective forgery ring," Los Angeles Police 
Detective Pat Riley said. "They were able, with ease, to withdraw lots of money 
and the only time the bank (account) holder would know was at the end of the 
month when he looked at his bank statement. We figure they stole millions of 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the scheme, the suspects allegedly mass-produced fake driver's 
licenses, credit cards, Social Security cards and other picture identification, 
then used the bogus materials to withdraw millions of dollars from other 
people's accounts at banks throughout the state, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are not certain how members of the ring got enough information about 
existing bank accounts to pull off the scam, but they suspect that they had 
access to bank signature cards and carbons from credit card receipts. Police 
have not said how many banks are involved or whether any bank employees 
participated in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the city of Los Angeles reported over $20 million lost (in bank 
forgeries). This group here was responsible for a good percentage of it -- 
possibly 10% or more," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the large number of forgeries, police in August began an intensive 
investigation into the problem. That has led to 13 arrests -- including the 
three early Wednesday when Lonnie Jackson, 42, Cornelius (Connie) Albert, 44, 
and Adrianne Crea, 43, were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items found Wednesday was a stack of fake IDs, showing photos of 40 
people who allegedly worked with the suspects in forging bank forms, Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At one home, police found thousands of dollars worth of counterfeiting 
equipment, including camera equipment, sheets of paper that were used to 
practice signatures, stacks of used and unused bank checks and a list of banks 
"to hit," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have linked this counterfeit operation to forgery rings in the Bay Area 
and Orange County and believe that the suspects have out-of-state contacts in 
Minnesota, Nevada and Arizona, Detective David Hudson said.

UNITED WAY CLOSING IN ON $95-MILLION GOAL FOR 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With less than two weeks remaining in its annual fund-raising campaign, United 
Way of Los Angeles has raised $80 million of its $95-million goal. 
</P>
<P>
Donations have been running 5% ahead of last year's pace, a campaign that 
raised a record $88.3 million, campaign officials said. They predicted that 
this year's campaign, which raises money for 360 social service and health 
organizations in the region, will break that record. 
</P>
<P>
"The finish is the toughest part of any race, but we are reasonably optimistic 
that we can get it," said James Miscoll, Bank of America executive vice 
president, who is campaign chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising efforts are just getting under way among some of the traditional 
large donors, including financial institutions, aerospace firms and major 
retailers. If the goal is reached by the March 29 deadline, it will be only the 
third time in 20 years that the campaign has achieved its goal. The last time 
was five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
According to campaign officials, corporate giving is up 6%. Employee 
contributions, which usually represent about two-thirds of campaign receipts, 
increased 8%. United Way, which has been operating under new leadership, has 
undergone major organizational changes in the last two years. Chief among these 
is its expansion into new areas of fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the umbrella charity has looked to the workplace for most of its 
contributions, with the largest companies and their employees providing most of 
the donations. However, in recent years, economic conditions, company mergers 
and consolidations and labor problems have eroded that donor base. 
</P>
<P>
This year, United Way continued a strategy begun in 1989 of targeting smaller 
companies and professional groups, including hospitals and universities, the 
entertainment industry and the ethnic business community. Officials said they 
initiated United Way campaigns in nearly 5,000 new businesses in the last two 
years, 2,700 of them during this campaign. The most dramatic change has been 
the board of directors' decision to discontinue setting aside a "reserve fund." 
In recent years, the fund had been used to bail out campaigns that fell short 
of their goal, said Leo Cornelius, United Way's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, he said, money was allocated to the agencies before the money 
was raised. The fund-raising goal was set based on these projections, often 
resulting in shortfalls for the agencies. Now, Cornelius said, the campaign 
will be conducted before the money is allocated. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to cut the cloth to fit the pattern," Cornelius said. "We'll only 
spend what money we have to spend, and that is good fiscal management." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign volunteers doubled to 1,700 during the last two years, officials said, 
including an increase in the number of executives "loaned" to United Way by 
companies to do staff work during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Giving by Los Angeles county government employees reached $1,975,000, up 
$25,000 despite a restraining order that limited the county's ability to raise 
funds for United Way and another charity, Brotherhood Crusade. The order, 
issued in November after the United Way campaign was well under way, was in 
response to a lawsuit filed by a group of county employees who accused the 
county of coercing its workers into contributing time and money to fund-raising 
events. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign calendar also was streamlined this year, cutting fund raising to 
six months, almost three months less than in some recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Miscoll said that move will benefit the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Aristotle said that a work of art has a beginning, a middle and an end," 
Miscoll said. "Campaigns should not be any different. It adds urgency and 
discipline to the effort."

JUDGE BIDS FOR APPEALS COURT SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: GARY L. TAYLOR, ALREADY A CANDIDATE FOR A FEDERAL JUDGESHIP, NOW 
SEEKS APPOINTMENT TO STATE APPELLATE POST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his bid for a federal judgeship stalled by a political standoff in 
Washington, Orange County Superior Court Judge Gary L. Taylor has entered the 
competition for a seat on the state appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor confirmed that he is a candidate for a vacancy on the 4th District Court 
of Appeal in Santa Ana. Taylor, 51, is also Republican Sen. Pete Wilson's 
choice to become a federal judge in Santa Ana's U.S. District Court, but 
President Bush has not made a nomination for that post yet. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he entered the state fray at the request of Gov. George 
Deukmejian's judicial appointments secretary, Terrance Flanigan, who called 
Taylor last week and asked if he would allow his name to be submitted even 
though his nomination for the federal bench was pending in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't initiated by me at all," Taylor said. "I just responded to a 
request. When the governor's office calls, what are you going to say?" 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he would be "honored" to have either job. He said he first applied 
for the 4th District Court of Appeal two years ago, but that slot, a newly 
created fifth seat on the court, went to Henry T. Moore Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy on the 4th District Court of Appeal, which becomes effective April 
1, was created by the retirement of Presiding Justice Harmon G. Scoville. Susan 
Trowbridge, Deukmejian's assistant press secretary, said the governor hopes to 
make that appointment as soon as possible. But a committee of the State Bar of 
California must evaluate the candidates, a process that could take up to three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson recommended Taylor for the federal post Nov. 29, but his nomination, and 
action on a host of other judicial candidates, has languished amid a dispute 
between Bush and Senate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The senator of the President's party gets to recommend to the President a 
candidate for any federal judicial vacancy in his home state. Traditionally 
senators have recommended one person, but Bush is insisting that senators 
submit three candidates' names for each vacancy on the federal bench. The 
senators have balked, offended by what they view as an intrusion into their 
realm of power and discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he informed Wilson that he was also being considered for the state 
appeals court. Wilson declined to comment on Taylor's double candidacy. But his 
press secretary, Lynda Schuler, said it reflects Taylor's outstanding 
qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone is considered a real piece of talent, sometimes you can get the 
state and the federal (systems) competing for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler said it is not unusual for the nomination and confirmation of a federal 
judicial candidate to take several months. But usually, she said, it is because 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, not an impasse between Senate Republicans 
and the President. 
</P>
<P>
The state appeals court post carries an annual salary of $107,964. Under a pay 
raise package approved by Congress last November, the federal judgeship now 
pays $96,600 and will jump to $120,800 in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal post is a sought-after one and the field of 
applicants draws heavily on Orange County Superior Court. One judge jokingly 
said that "half" the judges in that court are applying for the spot. Among the 
applicants are Superior Court Judges William F. Rylaarsdam, David G. Sills and 
William F. McDonald.

8 CANDIDATES ENTER RACE FOR 58TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Eight candidates, among them Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays and Long 
Beach City Council members Jan Hall and Jeffrey A. Kellogg, met the filing 
deadline Wednesday in the race for the 58th Assembly District seat held by 
Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos). 
</P>
<P>
The deadline was extended five days after Brown, a conservative nicknamed Dr. 
No for his staunch opposition to spending measures, announced March 5 that he 
had decided not to seek reelection in the heavily Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Mays, Hall and Kellogg in the wide-open race for the Republican 
nomination in the June 5 primary are Dr. Seymour (Sy) Alban, a Long Beach 
physician, and Peter von Elten, a Huntington Beach banker and businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Bishop, a systems analyst for Orange County who lives in Long Beach, and 
Luanne W. Pryor, a Long Beach public relations consultant, will square off for 
the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Stier of Long Beach has filed as a Libertarian Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly district straddles the Los Angeles-Orange County border, taking in 
Seal Beach and Signal Hill and parts of Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos and Long 
Beach. With district residents being hit in recent months by the oil spill and 
malathion spraying, environmental issues are likely to be a focal point in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, 36, is hoping that the publicity he received in the days after the Feb. 7 
oil spill will catapult him to victory. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mays was back where he has often been since the American Trader 
leaked 394,000 gallons of crude oil in the ocean off Huntington Beach -- at the 
beach holding a news conference, this time to declare the last stretch of 
shoreline open. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the cleanup effort is over, Mays will not have the same access to the 
media he has enjoyed the past few weeks. But the mayor says that won't be a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably be better off," he said. "This takes a lot of time. I'll spend 
more time on the streets meeting people." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, meanwhile, said that she, too, will make the environment a main issue in 
her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"How do we manage our environment so that we don't destroy it?" she said. 
"Since I've been in public office, that's been an important issue of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Hall lost a bid for mayor of Long Beach two years ago. She is chairwoman of the 
California Commission on the Status of Women and is a former president of the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's recent departure from the RTD board stirred up a controversy after other 
board members learned that she went to work for a Torrance consulting firm that 
had just been awarded a $99,500 lobbying and public relations contract by the 
transit district's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The board killed the contract. Members said that although the arrangement was 
technically legal, its ethics were questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said Wednesday that she realizes that the RTD matter "was and is" 
controversial but that she doubts that it will hurt her chances measurably. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg, 36, was elected to the Long Beach City Council in 1988 and was 
appointed to the Republican State Central Committee by Brown. Kellogg also said 
the environment, along with crime, is an important issue. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kellogg said he intends to make government ethics a focal point of his 
campaign, he said he will not zero in on Hall's RTD dealings. "I'm running for 
the 58th District, not against anyone," said Kellogg, who is the author of a 
recent ethics package for the city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Von Elten, a 46-year-old Vietnam veteran and executive vice president and 
general counsel for the Mola Development Corp. in Newport Beach, wasted no time 
in establishing himself as a candidate who favors protecting the environment. 
He issued a statement Wednesday pledging to refuse any contributions from 
companies involved in offshore oil drilling or shipping. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental issues in this campaign are too sensitive and important to 
be tainted by political contributions to candidates by the same people who foul 
our beaches," Von Elten said. 
</P>
<P>
Alban, 65, said he had considered running for the Assembly seat two years ago 
but figured that there was no way to defeat the incumbent Brown. 
</P>
<P>
This year, though, he sees the race as anybody's. "There's room for successful 
professional and business people, and I want to be involved," Alban said. He is 
running on a pro-choice platform. His other main issues, he said, will be the 
environment and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against government control, but we should insist on double-hulling 
tankers," Alban said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, who works for Orange County, is the only candidate who filed for the 
race before Brown announced that he would not run. "I felt at the time that he 
needed a strong challenger," said Bishop, 32, who is active in Long Beach 
Democratic politics. "I'm still in the race." 
</P>
<P>
Pryor, 61, the only other Democrat in the race, said that the 58th District is 
one in which "often only a token type of campaign can be run" by the Democrats. 
But with Brown out of the picture, she said, it could be a different story. 
"This is going to be a very serious campaign," she said.

MIKE PENNER: GAUCHOS OFFER NO APOLOGIES

<P>
The eyes of Cal State Long Beach are upon UC Santa Barbara today, watching the 
dribbles that could have been theirs and the rebounds that would have been 
theirs until the 49ers got low-bridged by the NCAA selection committee Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos are here, facing Houston in the first round of the Southeast 
Regional, because the 49ers aren't. And the 49ers aren't here because the NCAA 
got peeved at the timing of the Big West Conference tournament final -- Never 
On a Sunday -- and decided to turn Long Beach's sure thing into a 
multiple-choice stumper: 
</P>
<P>
 a) If Long Beach beats No. 2-ranked Nevada Las Vegas in the Big West final, 
Long Beach goes. 
</P>
<P>
 b) If Long Beach loses, Santa Barbara goes. 
</P>
<P>
You didn't need a crib sheet to know what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington cried robbery and lashed out at the NCAA for 
not picking the right team, which, by way of extrapolation, made Santa Barbara 
the wrong team. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Santa Barbara (20-8) had two fewer victories than Long Beach (22-8). 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Santa Barbara lost a regular-season game on its home court to a 5-23 UC 
Irvine team. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Santa Barbara lost in the first round of the Big West tournament to a 
15-14 team from the University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington's conclusion? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for (Gaucho Coach) Jerry Pimm," he said, sounding not at all 
convincing, "but I felt he really messed up when they lost to UOP. When we won 
our (semifinal) game, I thought, 'We're going.' 
</P>
<P>
"It mystifies me. Santa Barbara lost to UOP twice and Irvine -- on its home 
court. That mystifies me." 
</P>
<P>
Pimm had questions, too. 
</P>
<P>
Since when did an NCAA invitation require an RSVP? 
</P>
<P>
Since when did a playoff team with 20 victories, including one over Nevada Las 
Vegas, need to explain itself? 
</P>
<P>
"We won 12 of our last 16 games," Pimm says, building his case. "And we lost by 
two at (New Mexico State), by two at UNLV, by one at home (against Irvine) and 
by three in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We were competitive in all those games, going into the last possession." 
</P>
<P>
Pimm also pointed to Santa Barbara's season-series sweep of Long Beach -- "A 
big factor" -- and the Gauchos' 78-70 upset over Las Vegas Feb. 26, which "gave 
us a shot in the arm" come pairings time. 
</P>
<P>
Pimm's conclusion? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we deserve to be here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Regional seedings have the same kind of feel. Santa Barbara 
landed in the middle of the pack, seeded ninth out of 16 teams and drawing 
eighth-seeded Houston (25-7) in today's 9 a.m. (PST) playoff opener. A victory 
over Houston would move the Gauchos into Saturday's second round against either 
Michigan State (26-5) or Murray State (21-8). 
</P>
<P>
The second round would be a new experience for Santa Barbara. This marks the 
third consecutive postseason appearance for the Gauchos' Eric McArthur-Carrick 
DeHart nucleus, but Santa Barbara was ousted early in 1988 (by Maryland in the 
NCAAs) and in 1989 (by Wichita State in the National Invitation Tournament). 
</P>
<P>
What to expect this time around? 
</P>
<P>
Any team capable of beating Las Vegas and losing to Irvine within a span of 
nine days ought to be taken off the board. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, the Gauchos do many things well. They led the Big West in 
scoring defense, rebounding and three-point percentage. They also were second 
to Las Vegas in overall field goal percentage and had the nation's No. 2 
rebounder in McArthur, who averages 13.3 a game. 
</P>
<P>
So how did they lose eight games this season? 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen turnovers a game, that's how. 
</P>
<P>
Pimm went into the season without a true point guard, so he elected DeHart, 
all-conference at off guard as a junior, for a conversion. The on-the-job 
training was a rough go for a while -- DeHart had nine turnovers against Iowa, 
six against Loyola Marymount -- but he's finally settled into the role. He's 
also averaging 15.8 points a game and shooting 47% from three-point range, so 
Pimm figures he can live with a few passes into the seats. 
</P>
<P>
McArthur averages 15.7 points and led the conference in both rebounding and 
blocked shots (3.3), which at least gives Santa Barbara the quality to counter 
Houston's quantity. The Cougars are a strong rebounding team, led by 6-9 
forward Carl Herrera (9.2 rebounds) and 6-8 forward Craig Upchurch (7.0). 
</P>
<P>
"We've got height," Houston Coach Pat Foster says, "but no bruiser like 
McArthur. Players like McArthur have given us trouble this season." 
</P>
<P>
Foster calls Santa Barbara, "a quality basketball team. They beat UNLV at home 
and lost by two there -- and the loss was probably the most impressive 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't slip up on us." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Long Beach deserved to be on the court today. Maybe the NCAA was guilty 
of petty theft when it kept the 49ers out of Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
All Pimm can do is draw up his starting lineup. And when he does, he will send 
out two guards, two forwards, one center and no apologies.

ONLY PAPER WORK REMAINS IN LOS ALAMITOS SALE

LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The partial sale of Los Alamitos Race Course to the quarter-horse interests of 
Ed Allred and R.D. Hubbard was completed when Lloyd Arnold, the current owner, 
signed the final papers late Wednesday night. All that remains, according to 
all of the parties, is some "house-keeping paper work" that should be completed 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold and Chris Bardis agreed to selling a half-interest in 125 acres of track 
property for $16.5 million. The transaction is rather complicated because there 
are several deals going at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The half-interest is actually being sold to Quarter Racing Inc., a corporation 
in which Allred owns 56% of the stock. He has an agreement from minority 
shareholders to purchase almost all of the remaining stock in the next few 
weeks. At that point, he will sell a third of the stock to Hubbard and Arnold 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
The deal should end the stormy relationship that the harness racing group, 
Arnold and Bardis, have had with the quarter-horse interests. Both were bidding 
to buy the track from the Hollywood Park Realty Co., with the Arnold group 
eventually winning. The purchase price for the 297 acres was $71 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, a long legal battle over rights to the property was expected to 
follow. Both groups then sought a compromise that would benefit both harness 
racing and quarter-horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to forgive and forget but we've done that," Allred said. "It's 
been a long bitter struggle but we were confident that the basic strength of 
our lease would ultimately prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said: "We're too far down the road to turn back now." 
</P>
<P>
Allred and Hubbard are also seeking approval from the California Horse Racing 
Board on the building of a racing facility in the Riverside area. The opening 
of the facility would create some overlap in night racing in Southern 
California. Allred would like to race quarter horses at Los Alamitos for 23 or 
24 weeks and for another 14 to 16 weeks at Riverside. Harness racing would be 
at Los Alamitos for about 25 weeks. There is a possibility that harness racing 
could also be held at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos has been experiencing a rebirth since Arnold purchased the track 
in September. Attendance and handle have improved more than 25% and there are 
plans for a major refurbishing of the track. 
</P>
<P>
The track will turn to quarter-horse racing in April. Allred said Arnold will 
still be in charge of the operations of that meet but Allred would be in charge 
of the philosophy. Eventually Allred and Hubbard will run all of the 
quarter-horse racing and Arnold and Bardis the harness racing.

SOFTBALL TEAM FOCUSES ON PLIGHT OF YOUNG FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's women's softball team has attained the No. 1 ranking in 
the nation, but the Titans also are working toward another goal. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Schnabl, an 8-year-old from Placentia who was a batgirl for the 
Titans last season, has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. The team 
has dedicated the rest of its season to Schnabl and is helping to sponsor a 
drive to find a compatible donor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot we can do," shortstop Jill Matyuch said. "We are just a 
softball team and we aren't on national television all the time. But we can do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Last season Schnabl was a member of the Titan Tuffies, a fan club of the team, 
and was a batgirl in several games. She also had been a member of local youth 
softball and soccer teams. In January, she was diagnosed with leukemia and, 
since then, has been hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Matyuch said the Titans will be wearing red wrist bands during games in 
Schnabl's honor. But their main goal, Matyuch said, is to get 300 people tested 
for bone marrow compatibility April 23 at the university. The tests cost $75 
and although about $4,000 remains from funds that helped 174 people get tested 
in another drive last week, more money needs to be raised, said Linda Schnabl, 
Christina's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Several team members have gone to the hospital to visit Christina, a 
third-grader at Warner Elementary School in Placentia. Christina's mother said 
the visits are helping her daughter, who has been receiving chemotherapy 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"It really picks her spirits up when they come in," said Schnabl, a music 
teacher in the Placentia Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Coach Judi Garman said the visits are helping the players, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all become winners because it helps us keep things in proper 
perspective," Garman said. "When you see Christina's courage and enthusiasm at 
what we are doing, it helps us go out and push even harder." 
</P>
<P>
In his two-year career, Cedric Ceballos left the following imprints on the 
Titan basketball record book:

<P>
 -- 22.1 career scoring average, breaking Leon Wood's record of 20.6. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 669 points, second-best single-season total, behind Wood's 719 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1,284 career points, sixth all-time and tops for two-year players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 362 rebounds, breaking single-season record of 326 set by Tony Neal in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 618 career rebounds, fourth all-time and tops among two-year players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 12.5 rebounding average, breaking Neal's record of 11.2 set in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill completed his career as the holder of most of the school's 
three-point shooting records. Hill set records this season for three-pointers 
made and attempted for a career (145 of 366), a season (77 of 186) and a game 
(8 made against Cal State Northridge, 18 attempted against Nevada Las Vegas). 
</P>
<P>
Three Titan wrestlers have qualified for the NCAA championships March 22-24 at 
College Park, Md.: freshman Jeff Maes (126 pounds), sophomore Lyndon Campbell 
(134) and junior David Jones (heavyweight). 
</P>
<P>
The baseball team's record of 9-9 is not quite where the Titans want to be -- 
in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
How often does a Southern California team get have rainouts this early in the 
year? 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had two games at home rained out against Rice, and three more during 
four days in Stockton, where a Big West Conference series against Pacific was 
rained out. 
</P>
<P>
"The rainouts have put us behind," Coach Larry Cochell said. "We haven't quite 
jelled yet. We need to play more games to gain the momentum we need." 
</P>
<P>
Two football players are competing on the track team this year, senior 
sprinter/receiver Mark Hill, and junior long jumper/cornerback Nuygen 
Pendleton. Hill ran the 200-meter dash in 22.22 seconds to win in a meet at UC 
Santa Barbara last weekend, and Pendleton finished second in the long jump with 
a distance of 6.87 meters. 
</P>
<P>
The men's team dominated the 5,000-meter run, taking first, second and third 
with Steve Frisone (15:13.78), Ray Trujillo (15:21.93) and Mike Richardson 
(15:24.30).

<P>
The Titan Athletic Foundation has a fundraising goal of $550,000, about $75,000 
more than last year. The booster group will be trying to raise most of that 
money during a drive that begins March 23 with a Casino Night -- an event that 
will try to "put the fun back in fund drive," in the words of Walt Bowman, 
associate athletic director and executive director of the athletic foundation. 
The drive ends May 5 with the May Bowl, the spring football game. Fullerton 
exceeded its drive goal of $425,000 last year by about $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kelli Moore and Roseann Alva, Fullerton's No. 1 doubles team, recently defeated 
the 13th-ranked women's doubles team in the country, Pacific's Leslie Powell 
and Lisa Gratsushima, 7-5, 6-4.

CENTURY 21 PUTTING NATIONAL ACCOUNT BACK OUT FOR BIDS

Century 21 Real Estate Corp., the nation's largest franchiser of real estate 
brokerages, said Wednesday that it is putting its $30-million annual national 
advertising program out to bid. 
</P>
<P>
The process places incumbent national ad agency McCann-Erickson in Los Angeles 
on notice that it must come up with some new and different approaches to 
promoting the huge real estate franchise operator or be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Competition for the contract is expected to be fierce: $30 million a year in 
billings make it a sizable one for most Southern California ad agencies to 
tackle. It is one of the largest advertising budgets of any company based in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Loughlin, president and chief executive of Century 21, said in a 
statement that the firm -- which has 7,200 franchises and had $65 billion in 
worldwide sales last year, its seventh consecutive year of record sales -- is 
"satisfied with the performance" of McCann-Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
But Century 21 has had only two domestic ad agencies in its 19-year history, he 
said, and officials believe it "prudent after seven years" with McCann-Erickson 
to investigate alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of McCann-Erickson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Oseland, senior vice president for marketing and advertising at Century 
21, said the company, which is owned by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., is in 
a rapidly changing industry that is undergoing a considerable amount of 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
Other major players have entered the market, Oseland said, including Sears, 
Roebuck &amp; Co. -- owner of Costa Mesa-based Coldwell Banker Residential Real 
Estate -- and Prudential Life Insurance Co. of American, owner of Newport 
Beach-based Prudential Real Estate Affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
With competition like that, he said, "we need to take a look at what we are 
doing (with corporate advertising) to see if it is the best work and the work 
we want to do for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker and BBDO Los Angeles severed their relationship last month 
after a four-year marriage. Coldwell, the nation's No. 2 residential realty 
organization with about 11% of the market, was spending $10 million a year on 
domestic ad campaigns through BBDO. 
</P>
<P>
Oseland declined to comment directly about the work McCann-Erickson has been 
doing for Century 21 but said that when an advertising account is put up for 
review "there generally is some level of concern about a particular aspect of 
the advertising, be it on the media side or in research or in creative." 
</P>
<P>
He said the review is expected to last 60 to 90 days and that Century 21 will 
make a final decision from among four to six agencies, including 
McCann-Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
He said that no agencies other than McCann-Erickson have been identified yet as 
participants in the review. 
</P>
<P>
Several real estate industry observers said that with Century 21 coming off a 
record year and with residential resale activity still healthy throughout the 
country, there is no indication that the company is aiming to dump 
McCann-Erickson because its ads haven't been working. 
</P>
<P>
In its most recent campaign for Century 21, unveiled just a few weeks ago, the 
agency created a spot featuring California Angels' pitcher Bert Blyleven 
discussing how often he has been traded in his career -- five times -- and how 
the last thing he needs is constant worry about selling his home. 
</P>
<P>
As Blyleven turns away from the camera and walks back to the clubhouse, Angels 
Manager Doug Rader appears and says he must talk to him -- the implication 
being that the pitcher is about to be traded again. Blyleven then reaches into 
his locker and pulls out a Century 21 "For Sale" sign. 
</P>
<P>
"They've done some good work for us in the past" Oseland said. "We are not 
doing this to change for change's sake, but we do want to explore other 
approaches."

Japanese Firms to Join Boeing Project: A consortium of three Japanese companies 
plan to invest about $825 million in the development of Boeing Co.'s proposed 
777 jet, according to a report published in the newspaper Asahi Shimbun. The 
three companies, led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., will inform 
Seattle-based Boeing by the end of the month of their intention to participate 
in the project. Asahi said Boeing had asked the three Japanese firms to 
undertake 25% of the estimated $3.3 billion development cost of the project, or 
about $825 million.

Furon Reports Strong 4th-Quarter Results: Furon Co., the Laguna Niguel-based 
manufacturer of seals and plastic products, said Wednesday it expects to report 
stronger fourth quarter revenues and net income. 
</P>
<P>
The announcment spurred a 11.5% jump in its stock price. The company said it 
expects to report net income of between $3.4 million and $3.7 million, 
contrasted with $1.8 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. 
Revenue was up 21% to $80 million from $66 million. Furon's stock climbed 
$1.375 to close at $13.375 in over-the-counter trading.

PUC URGED TO RELAX GRIP ON CAR-PHONE PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS: UNDER A JUDGE'S PROPOSAL, CELLULAR FIRMS WOULD BE ALLOWED 
TO RAISE RATES BY UP TO 10% -- OR CUT PRICES AS MUCH AS THEY WANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a proposal aimed at enhancing competition and encouraging price breaks for 
California car-phone customers, a state hearing officer urged the Public 
Utilities Commission to loosen its tight grip on cellular phone prices. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would allow cellular phone companies -- two of which are allowed 
to compete in each of the state's major markets -- to increase rates by up to 
10% a year without prior PUC approval, unless there are protests. It would also 
let the companies cut prices as much as they want without approval. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Galvin, the administrative law judge who drafted the proposal, said the 
commission will consider it May 11. 
</P>
<P>
The commission ordered a comprehensive look at the burgeoning cellular market 
more than two years ago. Galvin's proposal, which is being circulated for 
comment by consumer groups and the companies, represents the state's first 
review of a lucrative business that started during the 1984 Olympic Games in 
Los Angeles. California's cellular market is the world's largest, with nearly 
half a million customers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, a cellular company could file a proposed rate change of up 
to 10% a year with the commission and put it into effect immediately. If no 
protests are filed within 20 days, the new price would become permanent. 
</P>
<P>
If an increase of more than 10% is proposed, however, the cellular company 
would have to continue to give the PUC a 30-day notice. 
</P>
<P>
This notice requirement, now in place for any price change, has so far worked 
against competition by giving rivals ample warning of impending price changes, 
Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
In setting up the industry, the Federal Communications Commission awarded two 
competing franchises authority to build cellular radio networks within each 
metropolitan market but left it up to state regulators to set the rules. In 
California, the PUC imposed initial rates based on estimated operating costs -- 
prices that have not been reviewed since, despite a dramatic increase in 
customers and growing profits of such providers as PacTel Cellular, an 
Irvine-based unit of Pacific Telesis. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, there have been widespread complaints by car-phone customers 
over present cellular rates. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, companies that buy phone numbers from the network operators and 
resell them to the public have complained of unfair practices by PacTel 
Cellular and GTE Mobilnet, an affiliate of Thousand Oaks-based GTE California, 
which also sells service to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives for both firms, however, expressed pleasure that the PUC will 
consider reducing regulation in cellular pricing.

A court has ruled video giant Nintendo can sue retailers who buy 
patent-protected video games from its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington nullified a 
California court ruling that prohibited suits against retailers who sell 
products that companies say infringe on their patents. 
</P>
<P>
The California injunction stems from a lawsuit filed in December, 1988, by 
arcade-game developer Atari Games-Tengen Inc., which charged Nintendo with 
monopolistic practices through its licensing agreements. Atari Games also 
claims that Nintendo has infringed on an Atari patent. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo has consistently maintained that the manufacture and sale of 
unlicensed video game cartridges by Atari for use with Nintendo Entertainment 
Systems violated a number of Nintendo's rights. 
</P>
<P>
The court of Appeals said in its decision that Atari Games was unable to 
present evidence to "prove that Nintendo was . . . expanding its patent rights 
beyond their proper scope." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wood, senior vice president of Atari Games, said in a statement that his 
company had hoped not to involve third parties in the battle. He said the 
company would pursue the matter further in District Court.

SPRINT IS LATEST FIRM TO DO DEAL WITH EAST BLOC; 
</P>
<P>
PHONES: ANTIQUATED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS REPRESENT A GROWING MARKET FOR U.S. 
COMPANIES. 
</P>

<P>
A growing number of American telecommunications companies, seeking lucrative 
opportunities to modernize the East Bloc's antiquated phone networks, have 
managed to thrust their feet behind the newly parted Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
US Sprint has become the latest to do so. On Wednesday, the nation's 
third-largest long-distance carrier said it signed a preliminary agreement to 
form a pioneering joint venture with two Soviet agencies. The new company, 
Telenet U.S.S.R., will provide high-speed data and other telecommunications 
services within the Soviet Union, perhaps by year end. 
</P>
<P>
"As the perestroika process unfolds and economic bridges between East and West 
are built, modern telecommunications will become even more important," Paolo 
Guidi, president of Sprint International, said in announcing the agreement in 
Washington. Sprint International, formed in January from US Sprint's 
international and data network operations, now provides international voice, 
data and video-conferencing services and products for US Sprint, based in 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
US Sprint also announced Wednesday that it will take part in a new fiber-optic 
cable project linking Japan, China, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
US Sprint will not be alone among American firms in the Soviet Union. US West, 
one of the seven Baby Bell regional phone firms, already has signed on to play 
a leading role in an international consortium that will build a $500-million 
fiber-optic cable across the Soviet Union. That venture, the Trans-Soviet Line 
Development Corp., will provide a new high-speed link between Europe and Asia 
via Moscow and Vladivostok. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has proposed tripling existing 
calling capacity between the United States and the Soviet Union by using 
channels on the Soviet Intersputnik satellite system. AT&amp;T also recently 
acquired Istel, a British information company, as part of an announced goal to 
generate 20% of its revenue overseas within five years. Among its targets for 
equipment sales are the East Bloc and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile US West and several other Baby Bells have been "very aggressive" in 
penetrating East Bloc nations, said Mark Lowenstein, telecommunications analyst 
for Yankee Group in Boston. US West expects to start work this spring on a 
cellular phone system for Hungary. Chicago-based Ameritech, another Baby Bell, 
is discussing a similar cellular project with Polish authorities, Lowenstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis of San Francisco and a consortium of British, French and German 
organizations in December won the right to provide mobile telephone service in 
West Germany, which is about to begin unification talks with East Germany, 
where only 16% of households have telephones and more than 1 million 
applications for service are awaiting resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential (market) is practically limitless," Lowenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the obstacles these ventures must overcome, however, are restrictions on 
sales of electronic and telecommunications equipment to the Soviet Union and 
East Bloc countries. But the Bush Administration and NATO countries already are 
considering easing these restrictions, prodded by requests from the new 
governments of Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing its new venture on Wednesday, US Sprint said its partners are 
Central Telegraph, an agency of the Soviet Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications that provides international and intercity public telex, 
telegram and low-speed data communications services within the Soviet Union, 
and the Institute of Electronics and Computer Science of the Latvian Academy of 
Sciences. The institute specializes in computer networking technology. 
</P>
<P>
Sprint International's Guidi also announced that the company will participate 
in planning construction of a 4,500-mile undersea cable linking Japan, China, 
Hong Kong and Singapore. The fiber-optic link will tie in with a new 
transpacific cable that Sprint owns with Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless. 
</P>
<P>
Another cable covering the same area is expected to begin service this year, 
but current estimates indicate that it will reach capacity by 1993, when the 
second cable is expected to be ready, Sprint said.

It was 10:15 a.m. on Wednesday, and about 600 Orange County high school 
students were doing what they normally do on weekday mornings -- going to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
But these weren't your ordinary English or math classes. The students were 
taking their instruction from business professionals, who were providing them 
with real-world lessons on entrepreneurship, global competition and business 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour classes were part of the sixth annual Business Issues Conference 
held at the Anaheim Convention Center, sponsored by the Constitutional Rights 
Foundation of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit educational foundation organized the conference to "increase 
student awareness of the complexities of decision-making and business ethics, 
to promote critical thinking and encourage dialogue between business and 
education," said Patricia K. Hitchcock, executive director of the Newport 
Beach-based group. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six high schools from throughout the county participated in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, the keynote speaker for the event, 
said the county's job picture looks bright. "But there is growing concern," he 
said, "that there's a mismatch between the skills needed and the skills 
available. Education is the missing key component." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students at the conference said they found the workshops valuable. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped me learn what you have to do to get into a business of your own and 
to succeed in being what you want to be," said Ronnie Andrews, a junior at San 
Clemente High School, who attended classes on stress management, establishing a 
positive self-image and personal financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
Students learned about the world of foreign trade from Barbara Renaud, founder 
and president of Airtronics Inc., an Irvine aerospace firm.

Renaud stressed the importance of understanding other countries' cultures and 
learning about their different business practices. In many countries, she said, 
it is important to establish a trusting relationship with the foreign executive 
you are doing business with before a deal can be struck. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been very hard for Americans (to do business overseas) because they 
want that deal, that money or that contract now, because that's what they've 
been used to here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, foreign firms have had to adjust to American firms' business 
practices, such as contracts that "are 42 pages long with at least 20 pages of 
amendments," she said. "It's very hard for them. Their contracts are 
handshakes." 
</P>
<P>
Several conference sessions dealt with environmental issues and the impact that 
bad business decisions can have on the environment and local economies. 
</P>
<P>
In a workshop on toxic wastes, students watched a video showing the cleanup of 
the recent American Tanker oil spill off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The spill showed that the oil industry could have developed more advanced 
technologies to speed up the cleanup, said Ray Picard, chief of the Huntington 
Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Picard told the students that they will someday be the business people making 
decisions that will affect the environment and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to run things tomorrow?" he asked. Pointing to the students, he 
answered: "You."

Rights Acquired: Chiron Ophthalmics Inc. in Irvine has agreed to buy the 
marketing, manufacturing and licensing rights to a line of silicone 
intra-ocular lenses made by Staar Surgical Co. in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Staar will receive up to $4 million in prepaid royalties. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Staar and Chiron, supplier of lenses and other products 
to ophthalmic surgeons, has generated some controversy recently. 
</P>
<P>
Former Staar president Thomas R. Waggoner was locked out of his offices last 
summer after the company's board rebelled against his plans to sign an 
$11-million licensing agreement with Chiron.

EECO NEGOTIATING TO SELL COMPUTER KEYBOARD BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pressed by its bankers to repay more than $8 million in loans, EECO Inc., a 
Santa Ana electronics manufacturer, said Wednesday that it is negotiating to 
sell its computer keyboard business based in Arizona and the Mexican state of 
Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
EECO wouldn't disclose its asking price nor identify the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
But a sale of the money-losing keyboard business could put EECO back in the 
black, Chairman Robert B. Bonney said. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, EECO was saying it could turn the keyboard business around 
despite strong competition and internal problems. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, called Maxi-Switch, had already decided to lay off workers to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
But EECO's bankers wouldn't wait. EECO said Wednesday that its major lender 
extended a loan agreement until the end of March. Then, however, the bank can 
demand the approximately $8.5 million it is owed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the loan extension agreement, the bank can pull the plug even earlier 
than the end of the month if the negotiations to sell the keyboard unit fall 
through. 
</P>
<P>
EECO said that if the bank calls in its loan it isn't sure it can get financing 
elsewhere, and it hinted that the company may face bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The bankers had been cooperating in keeping the company afloat, Bonney said. 
</P>
<P>
EECO has struggled since 1986 with falling profits, the ailing keyboard 
business, a $13.2-million loss in its fiscal 1989 year and a $612,000 loss for 
the nine-month period ended Oct. 1. The company has been selling some of its 
assets to repay its loans. 
</P>
<P>
EECO's computer keyboard unit in Scotland, which the company says is more 
profitable than the Tucson-based operation, is not part of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The company also makes electromechanical switches for electronic products like 
stereos; "pad" or flat, keyboards used in appliances like microwaves and 
certain phones; and computer systems used to manage hotels.

A LITTLE BIT OF IRELAND CAN BE LIVED AT UCI: MUSIC, STORIES, JIGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Americans visiting Dublin, Jury's Hotel has become a one-stop spot to 
sample a variety of Irish cultural traditions, home of a cabaret-style show 
that has served up Irish music, dance and storytelling to sellout, 
tourist-heavy crowds since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"We do get quite a lot of American visitors," said Tony Kenny, a tenor and one 
of the show's stars. For Americans who can't make it to Dublin, Jury's Irish 
Cabaret has hit the road in a tour that stops tonight at UC Irvine's Bren 
Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an all-around Irish evening," said Kenny in a phone interview in his 
hotel room in Tempe, Ariz. During the Dublin show's off-season -- October to 
April -- it takes to the road. By a bit of scheduling luck, the current 
three-month tour through the United States and Canada -- the show's first in 
five years -- passes through Southern California during the week of St. 
Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny serves as emcee for part of the show and gets a solo spot in the second 
half. He sings traditional Irish ballads and takes some requests from the 
audience. "We can't go a night without singing 'Danny Boy,' " Kenny said. "They 
might also ask for 'Galway Bay' or 'Little Bit of Heaven.' " 
</P>
<P>
The show also includes dancers performing traditional jigs and reels, Irish 
harpists and a storyteller, Chris Curran. An Irish storyteller is a little like 
a stand-up comedian, but not quite: "It's not exactly a joke but a humorous 
story," Kenny explained. "The big thing is not the punch line, but the relating 
of the story." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill is Moonshine, a five-piece traditional Irish folk music group. 
Founder Colm Mooney plays the bodhran (the Irish drum) and the other 
instruments are fiddle, tenor banjo, Irish whistle and guitar. All the members 
sing. The group has been part of the cabaret for four years and has also 
recorded and toured on its own. It came to the United States in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
American audiences respond well to Irish traditional music, Mooney said by 
phone. "They associate it with bluegrass," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Folk music falls in and out of fashion in the United States. In Ireland the 
trappings of traditional culture -- especially music and dance -- hold a steady 
sway. "It's always been there," Kenny said. "It's not an entertainment in 
Ireland. It's a way of life," Mooney added. "That's why it never goes away." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury's Irish Cabaret offers an evening of music, dance and storytelling at 8 
p.m. in the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine, Campus Drive and Bridge Street, 
Irvine. Tickets: $15. Information: (714) 856-5000.

IMAGING YELLOW SUNS DECIDES TO REGROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After splitting apart in December over personal differences, the four members 
of Orange County rock band Imagining Yellow Suns have decided to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems aren't gone, but we've decided they're worth working out," 
singer-guitarist Ed Bernard said last week. 
</P>
<P>
IYS, which put out a solid debut album for Dr. Dream Records last year, came to 
a sudden halt when friction within the group led Bernard to leave. The other 
members -- guitarist Steve Cross, bassist Tim Bugge and drummer Rob Fadtke -- 
decided to keep the band going, but auditions to replace Bernard proved 
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard said the re-approachment came a couple of Sundays ago when he met with 
his former band mates for the first time since the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
"I really opened up as far as telling them how much I loved the band, and we 
just hit a common ground," Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird breaking up, and it was weird getting back," he added. "I think 
this weirdness is going to be fertile grounds for some creative ideas." MIKE

KINISON DUE -- OR IS HE?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Kinison fans, eager for the chance to see the comedian in a small venue, 
are plucking up tickets quickly for an advertised April 23 date at the Laff 
Stop in Newport Beach. The first show at the 280-seat club is sold out and 
tickets -- at $25 a pop -- are selling fast for a 10 p.m. show. There may be 
bad news for ticket-holders, however: Though the club insists that the date is 
firm, Kinison's assistant says it has not yet been finalized.

PLAYBOY OF THE COAST HIGHWAY; 
</P>
<P>
'GIGOLO' MAC DUFFY, CHARGED WITH THEFT, SAYS HE INTENDS TO 'PAY THESE LADIES 
BACK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
She was driving down Coast Highway on a sunny Newport Beach day, wondering why 
all the good men were married or unemployed. And then he pulled alongside her, 
darkly handsome at the wheel of a red Porsche Carrera. 
</P>
<P>
He fixed his eyes on her and, with a half smile, asked her to race. She 
declined, but he continued to flirt. She finally pulled over. He said his name 
was Mac Duffy. Would she have lunch with him? She couldn't, but invited him 
over to dinner. He followed her home so he could find his way back that night. 
During the drive, she giggled to herself: "I can't believe I'm doing this!" 
</P>
<P>
He was a pro golfer, he said, a successful one. And who would argue? Besides 
the Porsche, he had a pair of Rolls-Royces and a Mercedes-Benz. He wore Armani 
jackets and a diamond-beveled Rolex watch. He got massages daily and 
breakfasted most mornings at the Bouzy Rouge Cafe in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Over several weeks, Duffy, a Scotland native, talked in detail of his business 
investing in the European stock market. He oozed wealth, although he explained 
he lived in a modest Newport Beach apartment because of his extensive 
traveling. He listened over lunches and dinners as she revealed the problems of 
her divorce and of trying to raise two teen-agers as a single mother. 
</P>
<P>
When Duffy explained weeks later that he could invest her $16,000 savings in 
the stock market for a quick 34% return, she jumped. But when she asked for her 
money back, prosecutors would later allege in court, Duffy made excuses, then 
vanished. 
</P>
<P>
A private investigator she hired would eventually find him. At the time Newport 
Beach police arrested him, he was wearing a $1,000 coat, a Movado watch and 
$800 crocodile shoes. He had $1.36 in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Police and prosecutors say the Mac Duffy case is fraught with bizarre twists: 
his brazen highway flirting, the extent to which he played Mr. Rich, his quicky 
marriage to one victim in a failed attempt to keep her from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
And, in perhaps the strangest turn of events, only one of the four women he is 
charged with bilking of more than $60,000 reportedly wants him in prison. Two 
of them want him found guilty, but free so he can pay them back. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen anything like it," said Tom Martin, a private investigator 
from Orange who tracked Duffy down. 
</P>
<P>
In the months since Duffy's Dec. 18 arrest, dozens of women have called 
reporting a total of $150,000 they lost to Duffy, according to Newport Beach 
police detective Mike Ramos, a white-collar crime specialist who has led the 
Duffy investigation. "And those are just the ones willing to give me their 
names and background." 
</P>
<P>
Some called just to say that Duffy "tried that Coast Highway thing on me but I 
didn't go for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen women attended his Jan. 26 preliminary hearing, one traveling from Salt 
Lake City. Authorities said women claiming Duffy welshed on loans called from 
Southern California, the Bay Area, Texas, Florida, "all over the place," said 
Ronald L. Cafferty, the deputy district attorney who filed criminal charges 
against Duffy. But he stressed that, because it is not against the law to welsh 
on a loan, police did not investigate the validity of those women's calls. "The 
problem is this: In our great country, it is not a crime to fail to pay back 
your debts," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a fine line between reneging on a loan and borrowing money you never 
intended to repay, but prosecutors have charged in court that Duffy allegedly 
crossed it in four cases. By posing as a stockbroker, Cafferty said, Duffy 
obtained the women's money by fraud, constituting grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy concedes that he has not repaid money he "borrowed" for his golf career 
and what he called his "life style of a playboy." He has admitted in interviews 
with The Times that he lied about being a wealthy stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a little conning here and there. . . . The word gigolo isn't totally out 
of the question," he said. He acknowledged that he needs "some help," including 
therapy to control his desire for "material things." 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that he always intended "to pay these ladies back." 
</P>
<P>
So, as he awaits a May 8 trial on grand theft charges in Orange County Superior 
Court, Duffy, 28, is reportedly trying to earn money teaching golf at an 
Orlando-area club. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, whose attorney implored him to stop talking to reporters, finally did in 
January. But his wife, whom he still owes $16,000 plus the $4,000 bail she 
posted for him, keeps in touch with him by phone. 
</P>
<P>
"He's trying to turn his life around and do the right thing but it's hard to 
get a job with all this publicity," said Sylvianne Lestringant, who married 
Duffy in Las Vegas the night before his preliminary hearing to avoid 
testifying, but had to anyway because the alleged theft occurred before their 
nuptials. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to pay all these people back. I don't even know who all these 
people are. The ones I know about are enough," she said. "I'm getting harassing 
phone calls from all over and I just don't want to know any more." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's routine was, said Ramos, "like a full-time job. . . . He just went to 
work on Coast Highway." 
</P>
<P>
During a flurry of activity last fall, police, prosecutors, public records and 
interviews with victims provided the following account of how he operated. 
</P>
<P>
In all four Orange County cases, Duffy allegedly met the women as they drove 
along the shoreline, past beach cottages and the moneyed Newport Bay. It was 
here that police say he may have met hundreds of women between late July and 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he was in a Rolls-Royce, a Porsche or a Mercedes, "it was the car that 
hooked them in," Ramos said. "It was that first impression of wealth. Who knows 
how many hours a day he drove back and forth. He was a good salesman, and he 
did what most good salesmen do. He played the numbers game. One out of 100, one 
out of 50. If you knock on enough doors you may get, 'No, no, no.' But 
eventually, you are going to get a 'yes.' 
</P>
<P>
"He would flirt with them as they drove down the road," Ramos said. "He'd be 
smiling and waving, and point or wave to get them to pull over." He asked one 
victim to drag race, another to pick up her car phone so he could call her. 
</P>
<P>
Once they stopped and talked to him, victims said Duffy would ask them to go to 
the movies, or lunch -- right then. In one case he asked a woman to come with 
him golfing in Carlsbad. None of them went on these impulsive dates, although 
they said they exchanged telephone numbers or made plans for a rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
First dates with Duffy were almost always for lunch in safe and public places. 
Money would not come up for several weeks. By then, Duffy had already learned 
the woman's financial situation, and had "read her personal life as well," 
prosecutor Cafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
If a woman needed to hear how attractive she was, that is what Duffy told her. 
If she was in financial straits, he offered to help pay her rent, or explained 
how he could invest her savings in the stock market, Cafferty and Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
"With one woman, he even said he was concerned that she loved him for something 
other than his money," Ramos said. "Was he romancing them? I think he uses 
whatever is necessary to gain someone's trust, whether it was proving how rich 
and successful he is or telling them, 'You're special' or 'prove to me you are 
not after my money.' " 
</P>
<P>
"They believed him -- his show -- and that's where they messed up. It's that 
simple. They ran across a professional con, and he won. Once he's worked his 
magic, it's hard to sit back and say, 'How could they have fallen for it?' " 
Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
Only his new bride, Lestringant, would be quoted for this story. The others 
either no longer wanted to be in the limelight or were interviewed on condition 
that their names be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
"I have testified against him, I have been interviewed already. I lost my job 
and I am in debt," said one of the four Orange County women, a Laguna Niguel 
resident who lost $38,000 in what she thought was a stock investment with 
Duffy. "To get on the witness stand you are like being raped. And I have to do 
it again still if I want him convicted. I want to know how many more times I 
have to be victimized?" 
</P>
<P>
Added Detective Ramos: "You have to understand how hard it is to have come 
forward and let the whole world know that you fell for this guy's act. It's not 
like they were robbed at gunpoint on the street. These people played a role in 
their own victimization." 
</P>
<P>
All four women testified for the prosecution at Duffy's January preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Based on their testimony, Judge Christopher W. Strople found that there was 
sufficient evidence to order the blue-eyed golfer to stand trial on three of 
the four charges. The fourth grand theft charge has since been refiled against 
Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
His bail at that time was increased to $40,000 after prosecutor Cafferty told 
Strople: "Since this case was filed, I have talked to a number of other people 
who have been victimized by Mr. Duffy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Those victims, Cafferty said, include an unnamed Utah woman who loaned Duffy 
$15,000 for his golf career, and a Ventura County doctor from whom Duffy 
borrowed $20,000 for a car plus cash to travel the golf circuit. Cafferty also 
mentioned a woman now in bankruptcy who allegedly lost $100,000 in charges by 
Duffy to a credit card Duffy "got her to obtain for him." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't file that because initially it smacked more of a loan to him," 
Cafferty told the judge. "In the interim we got all the information from (the) 
Utah and Ventura (victims). I understand there are some people in Texas who 
have been defrauded of some money. This thing is turning into a bigger thing 
than we initially thought. I think the limited evidence that we induced in this 
proceeding is sufficient to show we have got a con man here and on a wide 
scale." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many alleged victims of cons and frauds, most of the people who loaned 
or invested money with Duffy did not go to authorities initially because they 
believed they were less victims of crime than their own bad judgement. 
</P>
<P>
But four Orange County women -- a 39-year-old Hughes Aircraft Co. 
administrator; a 35-year-old computer saleswoman from South County; a 
30-year-old stockbroker, and 41-year-old Lestringant, who works at her 
ex-husband's tool company -- saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
So they went to the police or a private investigator to get their money back, 
and finally, they went to the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
At 30, she is the youngest and biggest loser among the women who have testified 
Duffy took their money. 
</P>
<P>
As she testified in January, she is a certified public accountant and 
stockbroker by trade, forced now by her losses to work as a consultant from her 
Laguna Niguel condominium, which she is trying to sell to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I look to you like somebody who couldn't find a date?" she asked with a 
smile, brushing her long shiny brown hair from her face, pointing to her trim 
body in black leggings and a leotard. "I had a boyfriend at the time I met 
Mac." 
</P>
<P>
That day, she was driving her Mazda home from work when Duffy cruised up in his 
Mercedes and began flirting as they progressed to each stoplight. He finally 
motioned her to pull over, and she did. "I figured, 'Hey, I'm not going 
anywhere besides home anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
He asked her to have cocktails with him. She declined, but met him that Friday 
night for dinner at Tortilla Flats in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
She said she found Duffy interesting, but was not physically attracted to him. 
"He is sort of chubby, and not athletic at all. He seemed, oh, flaccid. I work 
out every single day. 
</P>
<P>
"But I thought he would be someone good to know. I know a variety of different 
types of people and we all network things. A friend of mine helps me with real 
estate, I do some accounting for him. I thought he would be interesting to have 
as a friend. But if he'd told me he was an unemployed golfer, I would have got 
some golf lessons out of it and done his taxes. So I was using him, in a way, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her lack of romantic interest, she testified that she continued to meet 
Duffy about once a week for lunch. She said she considered him a "good friend." 
</P>
<P>
One day he drove her to Corona del Mar, to show her the house he said he owned. 
It was a deception he allegedly would pull off on at least two women. He 
pointed to a gray stone, castlelike home a few blocks from the ocean, and said 
he was renting it to a family because it was too large for him alone. He walked 
her through the grounds, pointing out the cobblestone here he'd imported from 
Scotland, the landscaping touch there. 
</P>
<P>
She was on the verge of changing careers, and planned to return to school to 
become a psychologist. She had a $15,000 mutual fund on which she intented to 
live while working part time. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, she said, "hit me at a weak time in my life, a time when I had low 
self-esteem and wanted a drastic change in my life. . . . It was pure greed. I 
thought, 'Hey, I better get on this gravy train.' " 
</P>
<P>
She said he repeatedly told her she was living in "squalor," that she would 
never have anything more than "a measly $40 grand a year," a two-bedroom condo 
and a pedestrian sports car if she didn't act boldly, and invest. It takes 
money to make money, he would say. Her investment would be so meager, he said, 
that he was going to lump it with his own big bucks. 
</P>
<P>
She testified that he didn't sign a note for what he said were tax purposes, 
but she had "documentation" in the way of bank withdrawal slips and notes to 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you chase the almighty dollar? Living in Newport Beach and Laguna Niguel 
we want a better car, a better house, better clothes, more money. More, more 
more for the life style," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
She testified that Duffy persuaded her to invest her $15,000 mutual fund in 
what was to be a very liquid stock investment, money on which she would see an 
average 34% return in just three months. The mutual money was slow in arriving 
from Boston, and Duffy pressed her to come up with it because the window of 
opportunity to invest it was closing. 
</P>
<P>
She took a $10,000 advance on a credit card to get the needed cash, and said 
she gave it to Duffy. When the mutual fund money arrived, she said Duffy 
persuaded her to invest $9,000 of that, too, in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, at a South Coast Plaza jeweler, she said Duffy fell for a 
$15,000 diamond-beveled Rolex. Because he said his father would be furious with 
him for buying such a frivolous item, Duffy allegedly asked her to purchase the 
watch and he would repay her plus $1,000, when her bill arrived. She did. 
</P>
<P>
All of this was a gamble, she knew, like any high-risk investment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not sitting here waiting for a guaranteed return," she said. "All this 
was right about the time the stock market crashed 200 points. If he'd come to 
me and said, 'Well we lost it all,' and had some documentation, I would have 
accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it all the time in my work," she said. "People doubling up on their 
investment. Out of fear of losing the first $50, you invest another $50. I had 
this feeling that if I alienated him, he already had my money. It's the fear of 
recognizing your first mistake." Eventually she did. She testified that she 
asked Duffy for her money back. Over the next few days she said he repeatedly 
put her off with excuses about the difficulty in withdrawing money out of Swiss 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 3, he called and asked her to meet him "in a hurry" outside I. Magnin 
at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
As he drove her car to his apartment, she testified that "he told me that he 
was not a broker. He told me that he was a pro golfer and that he had used the 
money to buy various personal items and also to pay off a doctor or something 
like that. He was in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he was now fleeing a private detective hired by another woman to whom he 
owed money. So he cleared out of his apartment, and then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Police said he would telephone the women at all hours, begging them not to go 
to the police. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 10, two of them did. It was pure coincidence, said Detective Ramos. One 
reported she had lost $38,000, the other $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
By now, a third woman had entered the picture: Lestringant. She had given 
$17,500 -- all of her savings -- to Duffy for the stock market investment, and 
got the same treatment when she demanded it back. 
</P>
<P>
Lestringant hired private eye Martin to find Duffy. She testified in court that 
Martin quickly learned Duffy was not a stockbroker, nor much of what he'd 
professed to be. He staked out Duffy's apartment and favorite haunts for days, 
until he finally tracked him down. At this point Duffy gave the Rolex watch and 
Rolls-Royce pink slip to Martin, who gave them to one of the victims and to 
Lestringant, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth victim surfaced, alleging Duffy claimed to be a stockbroker when they 
began dating last year. She testified in court that she gave Duffy $1,500 on 
Saturday, Nov. 18, to entertain clients in Bel Air because Duffy told her his 
bank was closed on weekends. He said he would repay her or he could invest the 
$1,500 and give her a 34% return. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, she said she put on credit for Duffy two pairs of alligator shoes 
-- the same style, in different colors -- worth $1,537, which he said he would 
repay. That night, this woman testified, Duffy told her "he had invested some 
money for the Mafia and that they wanted the money back and that he was taking 
everything that he had to repay them and that his life was on the line, and 
that he had given them my $1,500." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy asked her for an additional $9,000 "to save his life to pay off the 
Mafia." She did not give it to him. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, all four women who are testifying against him in court learned of 
each other via calls he made on their phones. They worked together, along with 
Martin, to get Duffy arrested. 
</P>
<P>
But somewhere along the way, Lestringant said Duffy appealed to her "maternal" 
nature. The couple, under the mistaken belief that a spouse cannot be held to 
testify against her mate, drove to Las Vegas and married on the eve of Duffy's 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled Lestringant had to testify, and reluctantly, she did. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was held to answer to four counts of grand theft. Lestringant paid the 
$4,000 down payment on his $40,000 bail, and secured the balance with her home. 
</P>
<P>
"He's absolutely not my dream husband," Lestringant said. "I care very much for 
him and decided to help him. I wish someone else had done this before I came 
along." 
</P>
<P>
Are these women angry? You bet. So why do all but one want this guy out of 
prison? 
</P>
<P>
"If he goes to jail, I don't get my money back," nor do the other victims, one 
said. "Mac doesn't have a conscience now, but he's not going to get one in 
jail. Maybe he will get one if he learns the price of what he's done by having 
to work for the first time in his life. Now that would be justice." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry L. Steering, Duffy's Newport Beach attorney, understandably agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"All we hear about is the victims' rights. Well, the victims don't want to go 
through with all this, the testifying, so who is pushing all this?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer: the Orange County district attorney's office. Prosecutor Cafferty 
said the problem with dropping the charges is this: If you let a guy go who has 
allegedly committed a crime simply because he has paid back his victims, then 
you eliminate the punishment. And the deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Duffy's victims hope he is found guilty. But they want his sentence 
waived on the condition that he work to repay them. And if he doesn't, only 
then would they want him to go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Because the criminal case against Duffy moved from Municipal to Superior Court, 
a new prosecutor has yet to be assigned to the case. And issues of sentencing 
would not be decided until after a conviction, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
So people like Lestringant just wait, and hope. 
</P>
<P>
"If they send him to the slammer," one woman said, "we continue to be 
victimized."

JIM MURRAY: OLD L. A.: QUICHE IT GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I can remember when franchises used to move to this town. 
</P>
<P>
I can remember when this was the town that bailed out baseball, made pro 
basketball respectable, rescued the Olympics, moved football into the big time. 
Franchises used to be lined up as far as the eye could see, taking a number 
waiting to get in here. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball was the sick Man of Sport in the 50s. It was our "national" pastime 
only if you lived east of the Mississippi. When the St. Louis Browns moved, 
they moved to the Atlantic. The rest of the country was moving west, baseball 
was moving east. Horace Greeley must have been laughing his head off. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers came west, baseball attendance was down, demographics showed 
young people didn't care for the sport, found it too slow, too mannered, too 
antique. L.A. found it just fine. The people poured in. This was the first city 
to draw 2 million, then the first to top 3 million. If you don't think that's 
impressive, consider the St. Louis Browns drew only 80,000 for the whole 1934 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Pro football was kind of a cult sport, pretty much restricted to the New York 
Giants and the Chicago Bears when the Cleveland Rams came to Los Angeles. Guys 
who played in the NFL had second jobs. Now look at it. The networks and cable 
companies just paid $3.6 billion to televise it for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
When Bob Short took the Minneapolis Lakers west in 1960, pro basketball was a 
kind of pass-the-hat gypsy troupe that would drop a basketball wherever a few 
hundred people would congregate. They usually played their games as the second 
part of a double-header that featured the Globetrotters as the main event. The 
Lakers changed all that. They played games with Doris Day and half of Hollywood 
at courtside. They made "Beat L.A.!" a national anthem. Basketball became 
show-biz, then big biz. The league just paid the commissioner -- the 
commissioner! -- $27.5 million. Before the Lakers came west, Commissioner 
Maurice Podoloff used to take the subway to the office. When Jack Kent Cooke 
paid $5,175,000 for the Lakers, they thought he was crazy. It was the biggest 
bargain since Alaska. It was in L.A., wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>
The Olympics were a foundering enterprise in 1932 when brash, bumptious L.A. 
won the right to put them on. The world was broke. The countries couldn't even 
pay the boat fare here. So, L.A. brokered sales in things such as coffee and 
silk to help them pay their way. They couldn't afford housing. So, L.A. 
pioneered the concept of the Olympic village to house them cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way we used to do things here. L.A. was a place of boundless 
optimism and enthusiasm. "Why not?" was L.A.'s motto when the rest of the 
country's was "Why?" This was the kind of community that reached out hundreds 
of miles for its water, dredged harbors, pioneered supermarkets, invented 
freeways. It went for broke. It bent rules for the movies because it knew they 
were important to it. It took chances. It became America's Mecca. A city the 
size of Cincinnati moved out here every five years. They said amusement parks 
were passe, through. So Disney opened Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Now look at us. Wimps. A whole bunch of Calvin Coolidges. Pass the Perrier. 
Quiche eaters. We damn near lost the 1984 Olympics because some pussy-footing 
politicians and some bogus guardians of the public purse screamed it was going 
to bankrupt the city. They only made $300 million profit. They only saved the 
Olympics. Before L.A., there was no other bidder for the '84 Games. After L.A., 
Barcelona had a knife fight with a dozen other world capitals. 
</P>
<P>
There's no way that town -- the one that L.A. was -- would have lost anything 
to Oakland -- or any other city on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis was no stranger to Los Angeles. He was a coach at USC in the mid-'50s. 
I think he was shocked to see what L.A. had become -- a congress of churlish 
politicians, a college of doomsayers, checkbook clerks, guys who would fold two 
aces. It was not his kind of image of the City of the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Davis thought the Raiders were perfect for Los Angeles. Like L.A., the Raiders 
were notorious for doing their own thing. Going their own way. They were 
freewheeling, convention-free, uninhibited, uncritical, not hidebound, risk 
takers, go-deep kind of guys. The way L.A. used to be. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? Well, Davis had the high hole card in this high-stakes game -- 
the team. The city had a dilapidated edifice and a bunch of guys in three-piece 
suits and briefcases. It didn't take a genius to see who was going to win that 
pot. 
</P>
<P>
What's going to happen now? Well, let me guess: The Raiders depart. And the 
city, after a spate of blame-fixing, finger-pointing and sour-grapes snarls of 
"Good riddance!" sets about to building a new stadium for some phantom 
franchise or renovates the Coliseum roughly at the cost of the stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
There's precedent for it. That's exactly what happened in New York when Walter 
O'Malley pulled his team out of Brooklyn and took Horace Stoneham's Giants with 
him. The city that had turned down both of them promptly began to build a 
stadium (Shea) in Flushing Meadow and spent more than $100 million renovating 
Yankee Stadium. A small part of that investment would have kept the Giants and 
the Dodgers in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Chicago is building a gaudy ballpark just to keep the White Sox -- 
the White Sox! The city of Baltimore is building a ballpark to keep the Orioles 
-- the former St. Louis Browns. Oakland doesn't need the Raiders. Oakland needs 
schools, police, repairs, renewal. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders don't need a new town, they need a new quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. needs a new quarterback, too. Where it used to go long, now it punts. 
</P>
<P>
A town that let not one but two NFL franchises get away is not much of a threat 
to an aggressive, hungry sun belt metropolis. The prospects of the Coliseum 
being filled with anything but sea gulls the rest of this century is not good. 
</P>
<P>
We used to have a saying in this state, "Give us men to match our mountains." 
Now we have men to match their swimming pools.

L. A. PLAYS SUPER BOWL GAME -- AND LOSES; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SPORTS COUNCIL DID EVERYTHING IT COULD TO BRING THE 1993 EXTRAVAGANZA 
TO THE ROSE BOWL, BUT NFL BROKE NEW GROUND AGAIN BY CHOOSING PHOENIX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So much for the week that was in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Raiders announced that they are pulling up stakes and going back to 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, once the National Football League's winter 
wonderland, lost a Super Bowl bid for the second time in three years, prompting 
speculation that the game may never return here in the city's present 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Since when does Phoenix out-muscle Los Angeles under the Super Bowl boards? 
</P>
<P>
Since Tuesday, when the NFL owners, in a major upset, awarded Super Bowl XXVII 
in 1993 to Phoenix for reasons that don't always have to make sense. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Sports Council, the nonprofit organization that put the bid 
together, worked overtime and spent at least $85,000 preparing this week's 
proposal, which painstakingly weeded out the mistakes of 1987, when arrogance 
and shortsightedness may have cost Los Angeles the 25th anniversary game to 
Tampa in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
As a business proposition, this year's proposal was seemingly airtight, 
acquiescing to the NFL's ever-increasing whims and desires. 
</P>
<P>
After the Phoenix award was announced Tuesday, Philadelphia Eagle owner Norman 
Braman, chairman of the league's site selection committee, told Sports Council 
President David Simon that his city's bid could not have been more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
So what gave? 
</P>
<P>
According to sources who attended Phoenix's proposal meeting, the owners were 
persuaded by Cardinal owner Bill Bidwill's impassioned pleas of helplessness. 
He reportedly begged that a Super Bowl in Phoenix might be the tonic needed to 
save his foundering franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix also agreed to pick up the entire tab for the 1992 NFL owners meetings 
in Phoenix, which never hurts. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL also expressed a desire to spread the wealth around to some of the 
league's smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
So why bother sending Los Angeles an invitation? 
</P>
<P>
"Cities that want to be big-league cities are willing to do things that aren't 
even on the drawing board," Simon said. "The (NFL's) thinking is: 'We're 
breaking new ground.' Fine, but if you do nothing but break new ground, you 
discourage cities like L.A. from ever bidding. That's not sour grapes, that's 
just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
As for Pasadena, gone are rosier days of walking into an NFL meeting with a few 
8x10 aerial glossies and walking out with the keys to another Super Bowl. The 
Rose Bowl has played host to four games, the Coliseum two. The question 
remains: Will Los Angeles ever play host to another? 
</P>
<P>
Before this week's meetings, Simon agreed to discuss the inner workings of the 
Los Angeles proposal on the condition that the information not be used until 
after the site for Super Bowl XXVII was awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, obviously, was confident of victory. Yet, Los Angeles' loss to Phoenix 
only further defines how much the Super Bowl bidding game has changed. 
</P>
<P>
It actually began changing in 1987, when the Rose Bowl, for all its 
picture-postcard beauty and Super Bowl history, couldn't even make the bidding 
finals for Super Bowl XXV, largely because it was competing against Anaheim 
Stadium and the Coliseum for the same game. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum entered the race for the romance and symmetry that would have come 
with being host of the 25th anniversary game, having showcased the first 
AFC-NFC championship game in 1967. In light of the Coliseum's bitter, 
multimillion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, though, the task was not 
unlike asking a corporate enemy for a loan to help put the rival out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Fat chance for the Coliseum playing host to the NFL's annual party 
any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the three Southern Californian cities were competing with each 
other for the same game, Tampa rolled out the red carpet and ultimately secured 
the bid for Super Bowl XXV. 
</P>
<P>
"They essentially knocked each other out of the box," Simon said of the 
competing Los Angeles-area bids. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa also changed the Super Bowl ground rules forever. In the past, the NFL 
could be expected to pay host cities for the usual expenses: stadium rental, 
team buses, room accommodations etc. 
</P>
<P>
In a new twist, Tampa was offering the league its services free of charge, 
figuring the estimated $100 million to $150 million a Super Bowl generates in 
economic revenue for a community was well worth any concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Easy to do if your economic impact can be targeted and shared within concise 
city boundaries, which isn't exactly the case with the sprawling Los Angeles 
and Orange County landscapes, populated by about 11 million people. 
</P>
<P>
In the new-age bidding game, the Tampa task force commissioned 30 civic leaders 
to lobby at the 1987 owners meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa's squeaky-clean presentation couldn't have been more complete if it used 
cheerleaders and pompons. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Los Angeles's three-headed bid in 1987 for the 1991 Super Bowl was 
almost laughable. Ty Stroh, working for the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors 
Bureau at the time, first went before the NFL owners and pitched the Coliseum 
for Super Bowl XXVl. Stroh spoke with much bravado, then exited the room. 
</P>
<P>
"An hour later," as Simon retells the story, "Pasadena's group walks in, and 
who's with them? Good ol' Ty Stroh. And he had a flip chart. And where 
'Coliseum' was, he had pasted over a thing that said 'Rose Bowl.' He gets up 
and says that the Rose Bowl's the place. It was the same speech. It's funny to 
tell now, but he said it was embarrassing, and made L.A.'s bids look 
ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Especially when each city spent an estimated $100,000 for its presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh, in fact, warned that unless Los Angeles changed its strategy, the area 
might never again be awarded a Super Bowl after staging six of the first 24 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh suggested that the Los Angeles Sports Council, then a committee of the 
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, lead the charge in bringing the three 
stadiums together to form a consolidated Super Bowl bid. Sounded good over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, Anaheim, Los Angeles and Pasadena are essentially competitors in 
the same marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"The negative for L.A. is getting the community excited," said Stroh, who has 
since moved on to the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, which is 
bidding for the 1994 Super Bowl in May. "They weren't excited about the 
Olympics until the torch run. There's so many things going on, it's like 
another day. You can't sit back and have a beer and make a bid anymore." 
</P>
<P>
So in the summer of 1987, the Sports Council began work to bring the Super 
Bowl, and other sporting events, back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Council incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1988 and is 
supported by donations from area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Simon was one of five original employees of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing 
Committee. He was motivated by Los Angeles' lack of aggressiveness in 
attracting sportings events after the 1984 Olympic Games. Despite ready-made 
facilities, Los Angeles failed to attract a single qualifying event for the 
1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a small part of the shooting trials in Chino," Simon said. "That was as 
close as we came." 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Council has since won four bids, including the 1990 baseball winter 
meetings and 1991 U.S. Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball meetings don't measure up to Super Bowls, however, and Los Angeles 
wanted a second crack at the NFL's showcase event. 
</P>
<P>
That meant rounding up the three rival stadium general managers for a series of 
strategy sessions. Representatives from the three cities were Anaheim Stadium's 
Greg Smith, the Coliseum's Joel Ralph and the Rose Bowl's Greg Asbury. Ralph 
has since assumed another position in Philadelphia and was replaced by Peter 
Luukko. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can imagine, these GMs don't get together too often," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
There were eight members on the Sports Council's bid committee. Simon said that 
trust among the three cities developed, well, slowly. 
</P>
<P>
The first breakthrough was realized in May, 1989, when the NFL announced it 
would accept bids for 1993 from Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco and the Los 
Angeles area. San Francisco dropped out of the competition late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was real progress," Simon said, "because it meant this regional 
approach had gotten through to them." 
</P>
<P>
This regional approach wasn't without its politicking, though. 
</P>
<P>
Simon estimated the council needed to raise between $100,000 and $150,000 for a 
sophisticated bid presentation: money to subsidize state-of-the art video and 
marketing plans and the staff's travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The three stadiums initially pledged $15,000 apiece toward the goal. Simon then 
petitioned the convention and visitors bureaus of Anaheim and Los Angeles, 
asking for donations of $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim said fine, as long as Los Angeles wasn't involved. Los Angeles said 
fine, as long as Anaheim wasn't involved. 
</P>
<P>
So what of the notion of Anaheim and Los Angeles locking arms for this greater 
purpose? 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the bureaus are intensely competitive with each other in the big-time 
business of luring conventions to their respective cities. 
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast meeting that included Simon, L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau 
Chairman John Llewellyn, and Sports Council Chairman John Argue, Llewellyn 
agreed to take the issue to the bureau's governing board, which heavily funded 
Los Angeles' 1987 Super Bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, the Sports Council had its $50,000. Anaheim didn't contribute. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Anaheim Stadium and the Coliseum decided to cut their 
contributions from $15,000 to $7,500 apiece, having cooled somewhat on the 
whole idea when it appeared their venues were out of the running as far as 
playing host to the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
The council ended up with $85,000 for its presentation and made do. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the Sports Council needed to dissect the NFL's inner circle and glean any 
information it could regarding what it takes to get the game -- a sneak 
preview, so to speak. Were the other finalists -- San Diego and Phoenix -- up 
to the same tricks? Simon said he neither knew nor concerned himself with the 
strategies of the competing bidders. 
</P>
<P>
The council turned to Ralph, the Coliseum general manager until last January. 
Ralph formerly was general manager of Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, where 
he had come to know Braman, who just happened to be acting chairman of the 
NFL's three-man Super Bowl Site Selection Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Simon also enlisted businessman Shell Ausman, who represented several NFL clubs 
with the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen and Co., before retiring last year to 
join The (Marvin) Davis Companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Council arranged for a meeting with Braman last September in 
Philadelphia. Braman set aside a Sunday morning before an Eagle game. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of successful and rather generous bids from Tampa and Minneapolis, 
which was awarded the 1992 Super Bowl, Braman was dealing with considerable 
clout on behalf of the league. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Simon: "Tampa and Minneapolis basically gave the NFL for free 
everything that the NFL had been accustomed to paying for as, in a sense, a 
tenant. They said we'll give it all to you because we're Tampa and we want it. 
L.A. doesn't work that way." 
</P>
<P>
Braman wasn't shedding any tears over Los Angeles, however. In fact, the savvy 
owner recited an NFL laundry list for Los Angeles that sounded very much like 
Tampa's bid. 
</P>
<P>
"He said we want this free and that free," Simon said. "And we're saying, 
'Where's the revenue left over?' His answer is: Your community gets $150 
million in economic impact." 
</P>
<P>
Braman also said the Rose Bowl was the only acceptable venue for the game, 
which didn't comfort the Coliseum's Ralph. 
</P>
<P>
"(Braman) said 'You know what our demands are,' " Simon remembered. "His last 
words were: 'Make your best offer.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Council's efforts appeared doomed. With its three-city proposition, 
there seemed no way it could match the sweetheart deals offered Tampa and 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, for example, has only 1,500 available hotel rooms in the city, so how 
could it give the Super Bowl away for nothing and recoup its losses? In the 
three-city concept, Los Angeles benefits economically by housing a majority of 
the visitors. Anaheim and Orange County would accommodate the participating 
teams and media. 
</P>
<P>
Simon figured it would take about $1 million from the NFL to make it work for 
Pasadena. But the NFL wasn't budging. 
</P>
<P>
A major turning point came last December in New York, when the Sports Council 
met privately with Jim Steeg, the NFL's Director of Special Events, who 
suggested the league sell 1,500 tickets back to the Sports Council, which could 
package the seats for maximum profits. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 20, 1990, members of the Sports Council were called back to New York to 
meet again with Braman, who asked the group to detail what Los Angeles couldn't 
offer the NFL free. 
</P>
<P>
Simon informed Braman the council didn't have the money to provide such items 
as free team buses, team hotel rooms or NFL staff accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Braman wondered if Los Angeles could make it work if the league sold the 
Council a total of 2,500 tickets. Simon said yes, and Braman said, "Do it." 
</P>
<P>
The idea was this: The Sports Council would buy the 2,500 tickets from the 
league at face value, say, $125, then package them for $1,000 apiece, offering 
purchasers, presumably corporations, a deal that would include a good seat, 
preferred parking, day-of-game brunch, postgame meal, maybe a club membership 
and other perks. 
</P>
<P>
With the net revenue from these ticket sales, which might be expected to exceed 
$1 million, the council could repay Pasadena for monies lost in stadium rental 
fees and other concessions to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
The council would also set aside a certain amount, not less than $100,000 for 
each city, to be used specifically for capital improvements at Anaheim Stadium, 
the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles could now provide the NFL with all the freebies it requested and 
not lose its shirt. Suddenly, there was hope. 
</P>
<P>
At another New York meeting near the end of February, Braman demanded, among 
other things, guaranteed rates at the press hotels and caps on limousine prices 
in the city. The Council agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Braman wanted to know what assurances the council could give that the Rose 
Bowl's press box would be remodeled, as promised, with 272 new "Flex-box" seats 
and additional 1,272 luxury "Club Seats" beneath the press box. 
</P>
<P>
"How do we know you won't renege?" Braman reportedly told the council. "We 
don't even have a resolution from your city council." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, Braman got his resolution when the Pasadena Board of Directors 
approved in concept an $8.2-million Rose Bowl renovation proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Braman, at last, was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
Simon liked his city's chances, considering the Rose Bowl's superior seating 
capacity and the obvious implications. Each NFL owner receives 1% of the 
tickets at each Super Bowl, which translates to 300 more tickets per owner at 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
With 100,000 seats priced at $125 each, the NFL would clear about $12.5 million 
in gate receipts alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles bid also provided the NFL, among other things, the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Exclusive and free use of the stadium for two weeks before the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Exclusive and free use on game day, including expenses of up to $211,416. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Exclusive and free use of 34 luxury boxes and a club lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Right to have only NFL Properties merchandise sold in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Right to approve final pricing of all items sold within the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free use of practice sites. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free use of two sites for the Commissioner's Friday Night party, either the 
Sports Arena or the Pasadena Center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free team hotels, buses and NFL staff rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles offered the NFL the its choice of practice sites -- Cal State 
Fullerton, Orange Coast College, Rams Park in Anaheim or UC Irvine. If 
preferred, practice facilities closer to the Rose Bowl were available at either 
USC or UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau committed in writing 13,480 
quality hotel rooms in the area, with written assurances that they will not 
charge more than its "published 1993 rack rate." 
</P>
<P>
A pretty good deal for the NFL? 
</P>
<P>
"In fairness, yes, they're asking for the moon," Simon said. "And they're 
accustomed now to getting it. We went in not knowing how we were going to pay 
for it. But it's a win-win situation for everybody. We have made it possible 
for them to consider coming back here." 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's vote, Braman encouraged Los Angeles to bid again someday. The 
NFL, however, has already committed the 1994 game to a city in the Southeast, 
meaning the soonest opening won't come until 1995. And that's assuming the 
league will offer Los Angeles a bid for that game. And that's assuming Los 
Angeles wants to spend the money to try again. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably be dormant for a while," Simon conceded.

A CINDERELLA LABEL CAN TURN SLIPPERY; 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: CARLESIMO WAS SETON PRETTY LAST SEASON, BUT NOW HE'S ON THE OUTSIDE 
LOOKING IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
P.J. Carlesimo, author of last year's college basketball Cinderella story with 
Seton Hall, was sitting in his hotel room in Tucson exactly one year ago today 
with one thought stirring in his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we could win the national championship," Carlesimo said. "After the Big 
East tournament, we knew we could beat anybody in the country." 
</P>
<P>
One team they couldn't beat was Michigan, which defeated upstart Seton Hall in 
the national championship game in Seattle. Even so, the Pirates had sailed 
through the West Regional and into the Final Four and had even managed to dock 
near the harbor of the NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
It was a story for the ages, or at least 12 months, which is how long it has 
been since Carlesimo and his beard became front page news and his team lost by 
a whisker to the Wolverines. Now, it's time for a new Cinderella team, or 
whatever you call it, to take its place in the NCAA basketball tournament that 
begins today. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded teams are Oklahoma in the Midwest, Connecticut in the East, 
Michigan State in the Southeast and Nevada Las Vegas in the West. There are 60 
others in the field, all of them searching for the NCAA title, which slipped 
out of Carlesimo's hands a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall lost its top seven players from the Final Four runner-up team and 
finished 12-16, which means that instead of playing its way through the NCAA 
tournament again, Carlesimo is busy recruiting. Tuesday and part of Wednesday 
he was in Kansas. He was in the studio Wednesday afternoon to tape his 
television show. He was in Madison Square Garden Wednesday night to watch the 
New York City basketball championships. However, he was not in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"No, but we're going to be good in the future," Carlesimo said. 
</P>
<P>
So Cinderella will be somebody different this year. Will it be 28-5 
Connecticut? Well, first a word about Cinderella. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who are still going to tell you that Connecticut is a 
Cinderella team," Carlesimo said. "You can't help ignorance. There are people 
still questioning Connecticut. They were co-champs of the Big East, they just 
won the Big East tournament, they were 28-5 with one of the best schedules in 
the country and people are still saying 'How good are they?' I mean, they're as 
good as anybody in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are Cinderella teams, but I don't think we were one last year, 
either," he said. "The No. 11 team in the final AP poll is a Cinderella team? I 
didn't mind it, it was a nice story, but people weren't giving our kids credit 
for how good they were. Just like they're not giving Connecticut credit. 
</P>
<P>
"How many teams can win the national tournament this year? There are 10 to 15 
real strong candidates. Last year, we were 11, we were top 20 from like the 
first week in December. The problem was, people weren't used to looking at 
Seton Hall being nationally ranked, so they had trouble dealing with that. We 
were still answering that question at the press conference Sunday in Seattle: 
'How are you guys here?' 'Are you surprised you are here?' 
</P>
<P>
"Talk to Southwest Missouri and Evansville and Indiana and Vegas and Duke. Ask 
them if they think we were a good team. Connecticut will go through the same 
thing. If and when they lose, people are going to say 'I knew they weren't that 
good.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies are that lucky, though. Through the graciousness of the NCAA 
selection committee, Connecticut is scheduled to play its first two games in 
the Hartford Civic Center, where the Huskies were 7-1 this year waiting for 
their arena to be built on campus in Storrs, 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Such placement of a top-seeded team has caused some consternation among many, 
including Dick Vitale. The ABC and ESPN broadcaster says Connecticut got an 
unwarranted home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Connecticut played its Husky Classic in December," Vitale said. "Now 
it's in March. It's just a no-no at tournament time and that really bothers 
me." 
</P>
<P>
The path that Seton Hall traveled last year from its campus in South Orange, 
N.J., was not as friendly -- Tucson to Denver to Seattle -- and the trip took 
22 days. They passed quickly, Carlesimo said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a whirlwind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the obvious favorites to experience the same ride, Carlesimo said there 
are some dark horses out there in the field. He mentioned East Tennessee State 
(27-6) as one, but the Buccaneers have a first-round meeting with Georgia Tech 
(24-6) in the Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
"Providence is a sneaky team," Carlesimo said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Friars' draw is downright straightforward -- Ohio State in the first 
round and then probably UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the teams that are kind of down the line a little bit in the big 
conferences," Carlesimo said. "I think they can do some damage. I just think 
it's very, very difficult if you're not from one of the strong conferences. I 
would say this year, the Big East, Big Ten, Big Eight and ACC. I think it's 
very difficult if you're not from one of those leagues to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's not to say that Arizona or Louisville isn't good enough to do it 
because certainly they are," he said. "I just think there's such a tremendous 
edge when you play 15-16 killer games during the year as opposed to six or 
eight or nine. I think it just helps you a lot more, that you're better 
positioned and you're better able to win the six games you've got to win to get 
the thing done." 
</P>
<P>
Barring upsets, the first showdowns between the big powers occur in the second 
round: 
</P>
<P>
Midwest: Oklahoma (26-4) vs. North Carolina (19-12); Illinois (21-7) vs. 
Arkansas (26-4). 
</P>
<P>
Southeast: Louisiana State (22-8) vs. Georgia Tech (24-6); Minnesota (20-8) vs. 
Missouri (26-5); Syracuse (24-6) vs. Virginia (19-11). 
</P>
<P>
East: Connecticut vs. Indiana (18-10); Clemson (24-8) vs. La Salle (29-1); St. 
John's (23-9) vs. Duke (24-8). 
</P>
<P>
West: Oregon State (22-6) vs. Louisville (26-7); New Mexico State (26-4) vs. 
Michigan (22-7); Alabama (24-8) vs. Arizona (24-6). 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo believes the best coaching jobs in the country have been turned in by 
Jim Calhoun of Connecticut, Gene Keady of Purdue and Jud Heathcote of Michigan 
State, but he also believes that no coach wins without talented players. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a fluke wins this tournament," he said. "You got to win six 
games against great teams. In single-elimination, it doesn't mean the best team 
wins it. But it certainly is an excellent team and a team playing well. One 
thing I'll give the pros over us is the way they do their playoffs because 
playing the best three of five and the best four out of seven, you find out who 
the best team is. In college, you never know who the best team is. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we get to Denver, the four teams are there because they deserve to be 
there. It's absolutely impossible for somebody to get to the Final Four who 
doesn't belong." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins the national title April 2 in McNichols Arena, whether it be 
someone such as La Salle, the team with the best record, or a team such as 
Southern Mississippi, which just barely got in the tournament, Carlesimo said 
it will have earned its triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Take Southern Mississippi for example. The Golden Eagles (20-11) are seeded 
13th in the East Regional and the lowest-seeded at-large team in the 64-team 
field. And that means Southern Mississippi was probably the last team chosen. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we did get in," Coach M.K. Turk said. "And now, it's what 
you do when you get there." 
</P>
<P>
What Seton Hall did when it got there is something Carlesimo won't forget when 
he's watching the games on television or when he's sitting in the stands in 
Denver as a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did last year, it's very difficult to express," he said. "It means a 
lot to the coaches and the school, but it's incredible what it means to the 
kids. It was easily the best thing I had every experienced in basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Someone will share Carlesimo's experience in the very near future. They may 
remember the practices, the press conferences, the fans, the games and how fast 
it all went. In this game, 64 teams are going to be divided down to a Final 
Four. It will be long division, lasting over two weekends at 12 sites until the 
final weekend in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly one year ago in Seattle, Carlesimo was immersed in his own Final Four 
experience, even if he didn't know what was hitting him at times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a relief when they're doing the starting lineups on Saturday and 
Monday," he said. "That was the most fun. Then there's nothing else to do but 
play the game. It was just great. I wouldn't trade it, don't get me wrong, but 
when we got back, people said 'What was it like?' It was like 'It's over.' 
Bang, bang, bang. It's so quick. It's incredible."

<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: BARKLEY SPARKS THE 76ERS TO THEIR FIRST VICTORY OVER LAKERS

<P>
Candor might be Charles Barkley's most engaging attribute. He speaks with 
little fear of reprisal, stating unvarnished truths that others might find too 
harsh or delicate to articulate. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, after the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Lakers for the first 
time in 11 meetings, dating to the 1984-85 season, Barkley bluntly explained 
why it took so long for his team to break through. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the talent to beat them," Barkley said. "We didn't sit around 
thinking about it, because we had (bad) players. That was the answer. We had no 
players." 
</P>
<P>
They do now. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers can attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
Building as much as a 12-point third-quarter lead behind guard Johnny Dawkins' 
outside shooting and Barkley's strong inside play, the 76ers withstood a late 
Laker rally for a 116-110 victory before 18,168 at the Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Tempering the victory for the 76ers was the loss of power forward Rick Mahorn, 
who hurt his lower back in a fourth-quarter collision with Barkley and is out 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, the Lakers' depression over the end of their four-game 
winning streak was tempered by the knowledge that Philadelphia is a quality 
team -- "good on the verge of being great," Pat Riley said -- and that they 
still are tied with the Detroit Pistons for the NBA's best record. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, who play at Cleveland tonight, are three games ahead of 
second-place Portland in Pacific Division. Their top priority, however, is to 
finish better than the Pistons and receive home-court advantage throughout the 
playoffs. Today, the Lakers and Pistons are 47-15. "Tied is the key word 
there," Laker center Mychal Thompson said. "We're the better team still. We 
just have to take care of our own business." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley and cohorts made it their business to interrupt what had been a 
dominant stretch for the Lakers, who had won 16 of 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins, left alone on the perimeter when the Lakers double-teammed Barkley, 
tied his career high with 30 points and added 10 assists. Barkley, meanwhile, 
was his dominating self. He finished with 35 points and 19 rebounds and won a 
battle with Magic Johnson to see which player would take command of the game in 
the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it looked as if Johnson, who had 34 points, would lead an 
improbable Laker comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers trailed by six points with 42 seconds to play when James Worthy 
grabbed Orlando Woolridge's missed free throw and passed to Johnson behind the 
three-point line. Johnson made his fourth three-point shot of the game to cut 
Philadelphia's lead to 109-106 with 34 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Hersey Hawkins countered with two free throws with 29.1 seconds left for a 
111-106 lead, but Johnson drove the lane for a layup to make it 111-108 with 
24.6 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers fouled again, and Dawkins missed both free throws with 23.5 seconds 
left. After a Laker timeout, Johnson went one-on-one with Barkley on the left 
wing. He backed in, then spun around and missed a running jumper with 16.6 
seconds left. Dawkins grabbed the rebound and was fouled by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
As Dawkins approached the free-throw line, Barkley sidled up and whispered in 
his ear. 
</P>
<P>
Words of encouragement, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I told him I'd let him off the hook for those first two misses," Barkley 
said. "But I said if he missed the next two, I'd kill him." 
</P>
<P>
With the wrath of Barkley hovering, Dawkins made both free throws to make it 
113-108. Barkley then stole the inbounds pass from Woolridge to Johnson, made a 
layup and an accompanying free throw after being fouled by Woolridge. That made 
it 116-108, and the 76ers simply let Worthy sink a layup shortly before the 
buzzer and commenced celebrating what they called an important victory. 
</P>
<P>
While the Lakers are concerned with such lofty goals as finishing with the 
league's best record, Philadelphia is simply trying to reclaim first place in 
the Atlantic Division. The 76ers had it for a few days after beating New York 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
But they had lost their last three going into Wednesday's game, prompting 
Barkley to call a team meeting late Tuesday night. Now, the 76ers (39-25) trail 
the idle Knicks by one game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we panicked or anything," Barkley said. "It didn't matter who we 
played tonight. We'd play high school teams just to get a win. The Lakers are a 
very good team. But we've got a good team. We just got to play like this every 
night. If we do, we can beat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rick Mahorn's injury was diagnosed as a sciatic nerve injury in his lower back. 
Mahorn had blocked Mychal Thompson's shot, then ran into an onrushing Charles 
Barkley. He was on the floor for about five minutes. "When he hit the ground, 
he had no feeling in his one (left) leg," Coach Jim Lynam said. "He's able to 
move now, but very gingerly." . . . The 76er guards, Johnny Dawkins and Hersey 
Hawkins, combined for 54 points and 12 assists. The Lakers' backcourt tandem of 
Magic Johnson and Byron Scott combined for 39 points. Johnson had 34. . . . The 
last time Philadelphia beat the Lakers was Dec. 7, 1984. Moses Malone scored 35 
points for the 76ers that night. . . . Reserve center Jawann Oldham has been 
signed to a second 10-day contract. Oldham has played in only two of the past 
six games.

SALE OF HALF-INTEREST IN LOS ALAMITOS RACE COURSE FINALIZED

<P>
The partial sale of Los Alamitos Race Course to the quarter horse interests of 
Ed Allred and R.D. Hubbard was completed Wednesday night when Lloyd Arnold, the 
current owner, signed the final papers. 
</P>
<P>
All that remains, according to all parties, is "housekeeping paper work" that 
should be completed next week. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold and Chris Bardis agreed to selling half-interest in 125 acres of track 
property for $16.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The half-interest is actually being sold to Quarter Racing Inc. a corporation 
of which Allred owns 56% of the stock. He has an agreement from minority 
shareholders to purchase almost all of the remaining stock in the next few 
weeks. At that point, he will sell one-third of the stock to Hubbard and Arnold 
separately.

GOLF THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP;

KITE BELIEVES IT'S MAJOR LEAGUE

Tom Kite regards the Players Championship that begins today at the Tournament 
Players Club in Sawgrass as a fifth major. 
</P>
<P>
Now Kite, who hasn't won what is generally regarded as a major championship -- 
Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA -- might be biased. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he's the defending champion on this demanding stadium course with an 
island green and a premium on accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kite said he suggested that this tournament is a major long before he 
won here. 
</P>
<P>
Other professionals don't agree with Kite's evaluation. Nonetheless, the top 
players say that this is the strongest field assembled on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a fifth major, but it's a good golf tournament," said Curtis Strange, 
the two-time defending U.S. Open champion. "The field has more depth than any 
we have on the tour." 
</P>
<P>
That assessment was made with the knowledge that some of the top foreign 
players, with the exception of Greg Norman and Sandy Lyle, aren't playing here. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised those guys aren't here," Paul Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo would be in that category. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Players tournament would be even more prestigious with the 
addition of more top-ranked foreign players, Kite said: 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice if they were over here, but I don't think a tournament has to 
have any one, or two particular players play in it to be a major championship. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is so much bigger than any one or two players that it doesn't detract 
from the tournament at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think they're making a mistake by not playing in this 
tournament. You only have a chance to play in a limited number of tournaments 
of this caliber in your lifetime. And, if you start passing them up, you're not 
giving yourself the best chance to make your mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the same way about the top players here in the States passing up the 
British Open. One of the prerequisites of winning a golf tournament is to enter 
it. I do know that." 
</P>
<P>
As for the stature of Players Championship, Kite said: 
</P>
<P>
"It has all the ingredients that normally go into a major championship except 
history. There is no way to shortcut that. It just takes time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason why there has to be four (majors). It could be three, 
or five. It has changed before and it will change as time goes on." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, many of the world's best players are here with some at the top of 
their game, or close to it. 
</P>
<P>
Take Norman, for example. 
</P>
<P>
He won the Doral Open two weeks ago with a typical late charge climaxed by an 
eagle chip on the first playoff hole to defeat Azinger, Mark Calcavecchia and 
Tim Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Norman shot a final-round 62 to get into the playoff. In February, he won the 
Australian Masters championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a confident guy, but I got an extra shot of confidence by 
winning at Doral," he said. "It does you a world of good." 
</P>
<P>
Azinger missed an opportunity to win the Doral outright when he missed a 
six-foot putt for a bogey on the 18th green. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Nicklaus just told me to forget about it and that's what I'm going to 
do," Azinger said. "I just let myself down. 
</P>
<P>
"However, since September, it's the best I've ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Azinger cited his fast finish last year with a second and two third places in 
tour events, momentum he has carried over to this year. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Kite, player of the year in 1989, has yet to win on the tour 
this year, but he said he's playing better than he ever has. 
</P>
<P>
If he repeats here, he will consider it a major accomplishment even if others 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Huston, a first-time winner on the tour with his victory last week at the 
Honda Classic, had to withdraw from the Players Championship. He suffered a 
minor head injury in an automobile accident in Palm Harbor, Fla., and was 
medically advised not to play. There are four first-time winners on the tour 
this year. The others are Robert Gamez (at Tucson), Tommy Armour III (Phoenix) 
and David Ishii (Hawaii). . . . Ben Crenshaw has offered an award for his 
missing putter that was lost or stolen while traveling. His father gave the 
putter to him when he was 15, and he has used it for 20 years, including his 
victory in the 1984 Masters. . . . The purse is $1.5 million with $270,000 
designated for the winner. . . . The 10 top tour money-winners of 1989 are in 
the field. PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beman was asked if the absence of some 
foreign players was a slap in the face to him and the tour. "I don't think 
there was any intent in this," he said. "Our tournament isn't as close to the 
Masters as it was before." Beman added that if a top-caliber player passes up 
this tournament during his career, he would regret it later.

NFL MEETINGS; 
</P>
<P>
RANDOM STEROID TESTS TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The NFL will begin random testing of its players for steroids this summer, 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this will solve the steroid problem," Tagliabue said of a program that 
will subject every player to the possibility of testing on four occasions 
during the year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, implemented unilaterally by Tagliabue, the first tests 
probably will come during the May mini-camps, with tests also at the start of 
training camp and four times during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
A coded lottery will determine which players will be examined on any given day 
during or after the season, Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, you could be tested once, twice, not at all, or four times," he 
said. "It will be a deterrent because no player will know when he'll be 
tested." 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty drastic," said Ram Coach John Robinson. "They obviously think 
the problem is drastic." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL announcement was made after 6 p.m., EST. Gene Upshaw, executive 
director of the NFL Players Assn., could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said he had run the idea past Upshaw, and, speaking for him, said 
Upshaw agreed that "something has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue presented no specific details of the drug-testing plan. Unlike most 
issues under consideration at the NFL's annual convention, the particulars of 
this program were sketchily described. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner answered almost every question with the same phrase: "That's 
being determined." 
</P>
<P>
So far as he could say Wednesday, he has no idea, for instance, who will 
administer the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the program was announced to use the media to alert the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume the players read the newspapers, at least some of the time," 
Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, testing in the work place has been controversial. Courts have 
considered unannounced testing as a violation of rights of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
For example, during the administration of former commissioner Pete Rozelle, an 
NFL program requiring unannounced testing for street drugs was disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
But Tagliabue, a lawyer, said: "We're prepared to go to court. We don't expect 
to be sued." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Fralic of the Atlanta Falcons, chairman of the NFLPA committee on health 
and safety, has said that the league is less likely to be sued on steroids than 
on street drugs. Fralic is an outspoken opponent of steroids, and Tagliabue 
quoted him frequently. 
</P>
<P>
A player testing positive will be suspended for 30 days, Tagliabue said. For a 
second violation, the penalty will be a year's suspension.

AUGMON DOESN'T MIND PLAYING A LOW-PROFILE ROLE FOR UNLV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<P>
There was a time was when Stacey Augmon was Nevada Las Vegas' go-to guy -- for 
offense, for defense, for radio interviews, television interviews and newspaper 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
He was an Olympian two years ago, player of the year in the Big West Conference 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Larry Johnson, and Augmon became just another guy. Johnson became the 
only first-team All-American UNLV has had, and Augmon became honorable mention 
all-conference, not even in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is Augmon's close friend and roommate on the road, and Augmon said 
Johnson is welcome to the role of team spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"He took a lot of the attention, which is what I wanted, as far as everyone not 
coming to me," Augmon said. 
</P>
<P>
But even Augmon has taken note of the reviews of his performance this season, 
pinning this headline from the Las Vegas Sun to the wall of his room: Stacey 
Augmon Isn't Living Up to His Expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"That's their opinion," he said. "It doesn't bother me too much. . . . I know 
my potential. I know what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Augmon struggled in the early games of the season when he was forced to play 
three different positions in the absence of center David Butler, who was 
academically ineligible for the first six games. 
</P>
<P>
But one of his best games came against Temple, when he was forced to defend 
against guard Mark Macon because Anderson Hunt was ineligible for the game. 
Macon scored only 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, Augmon's defensive reputation has been sullied. Oklahoma 
State's Byron Houston scored 27 points off him. Arizona's Jud Buechler scored 
21. And more than once, Coach Jerry Tarkanian took Augmon off an opponent's top 
player, in one case putting Butler on Cal State Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Big West tournament came around last week, so did Augmon. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels got into position to be seeded No. 1 in the West in part by sweeping 
through the Big West tournament, winning by an average of 22 points a game. 
Augmon had some of his best games of the season, averaging 18 points in the 
tournament, five points a game better than his average. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the tournament, and we had to win to get the top seed," Augmon said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tarkanian: "I think he is one of the keys to how we do in this (NCAA) 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
The season of little renown has not bothered Augmon, but what would bother him 
is falling short of the NCAA championship. UNLV is playing with four starters 
who made it to the final eight last season, plus Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great about the whole situation," said Augmon, whose team plays 
Arkansas Little Rock (20-9) in a West Regional first-round game today. "My team 
is in position." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV lost to Seton Hall in the West Regional final last season. Augmon says the 
team was tired last year, and that this year they are fresh, and ready. 
</P>
<P>
"It's now tournament time, like everyone says, 'March Madness,' " Augmon said. 
"I want to take the team up a notch. If we do well, we can help Dave (Butler) 
in the (NBA) draft. If we win it all, we can get him in the first round, and 
get Larry (Johnson) player of the year." 
</P>
<P>
And what would be in it for Augmon? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I don't know," Augmon said. "Honorable mention?" 
</P>
<P>
West Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Little Rock does not want for tournament experience. In 1986, the 
Trojans upset Notre Dame, then lost to North Carolina State in double overtime. 
Last season, they lost to Louisville by five points in the first round. . . . 
Arkansas Little Rock played Oklahoma this season, losing, 134-81. UNLV lost to 
Oklahoma, 89-81. . . . UNLV has added a coaching consultant for the tournament: 
Ron Adams, the Fresno State coach who resigned near the end of the season when 
he learned his contract would not be renewed. Adams, a master of the matchup 
zone, was with the team at practice this week but did not travel with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State (22-6) will be making its 16th NCAA appearance when it plays Ball 
State (24-6) today. The Beavers are making their third consecutive trip, and 
have a record of 12-18 in NCAA games. They reached the Final Four twice, in 
1949 and 1963. Other games today: Louisville (26-7) vs. Idaho (25-5), Ohio 
State (16-12) vs. Providence (17-11).

Chris Dickson may have given some indication as to the future of the America's 
Cup when he sailed to three consecutive victories on the opening day of 
Congressional Cup competition at Long Beach Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing has become a game sailed on seas of dollars, pounds, yen and lire. Like 
free agents, the top sailors have been jumping national ships to sail for other 
countries whose well-funded but feeble efforts lacked only the talent needed to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Cayard of San Francisco, for example, was the late Tom Blackaller's 
tactician at Fremantle in 1987 but is now employed by Raul Guardini's Il Moro 
syndicate, which spent $2 million last weekend for a lavish launching of its 
first development boat. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is laughing at the Italians anymore. With the next Cup scheduled in 
1992, no U.S. boat is even off the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
But what worries the rest of the world even more is that Japan has brought the 
missing factor into the fold: the top-ranked match-racing sailor in the world, 
Chris Dickson. 
</P>
<P>
The only restriction is that a sailor must have resided in a country for two 
years. Rod Davis of the United States now resides in New Zealand, having taken 
Dickson's place in Michael Fay's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson, 28, now calls Gamagori, Japan, home, because that is where the Nippon 
Challenge is based, about a 2 1/2-hour ride via bullet train from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are going a lot of different directions," Dickson said. "I've 
joined the Nippon Challenge as a prospective skipper for the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
He said "prospective," the same term used in a press release, but a few 
paragraphs later he was quoted: "I will be the designated skipper and play a 
key role with Namba and the team in the afterguard." 
</P>
<P>
That would be Makoto Namba, who at least until recently was handing out 
business cards identifying himself as "America's Cup skipper." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that he has joined the challenge," Namba said, maintaining a 
brave front. "Nobody knows who will steer the boat at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
But anyone watching Wednesday's match between the two in the painstakingly 
equal new Catalina 37s would have no doubt who will be at the helm for Japan if 
the Cup were sailed next week. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson won by 1 minute 15 seconds -- a rout in this league -- and wound up 3-0 
for the day. Namba was 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson split with Fay after their strong bid at Fremantle and has run off six 
consecutive victories on the World Match Racing circuit over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
He got a leg up on a seventh Wednesday when his unbeaten record in the first 
three of nine races in the round-robin schedule was matched only by Costa Mesa 
sailmaker Robbie Haines, an '84 Olympic gold medalist whose forte is fleet 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson's father Roy has managed the Nippon sailing program for the last 18 
months, and Chris spent two months drilling the crew last year. Wednesday, for 
the first time in an event, two Japanese crewmen -- Ken Hara and Jun 
Matsutadara -- were among the seven people on his boat. 
</P>
<P>
The wind was only five to eight knots for the first two rounds but increased to 
13 as it swung west late in the afternoon, allowing the new, quick and nimble 
boats to stretch their legs. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson's most serious challenge came from Larry Klein of San Diego, who twice 
came from behind on the last downwind legs to pass and defeat two America's Cup 
veterans -- Australia's Peter Gilmour and Houston's John Kolius. 
</P>
<P>
But against Dickson, Klein was called for a port-starboard foul (starboard has 
right-of-way) in the tight pre-start maneuvering six minutes before the gun. 
Dickson protested, and the on-the-water umpires ordered Klein to perform a 
270-degree turn as a penalty immediately after their even start. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Klein said: "We don't know what he was talking about. If I understand 
(the rule) one way, he understands it another way." 
</P>
<P>
Dickson said: "He got into a situation that was dangerous for him, hesitated, 
and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
And Dickson seems determined that nobody will get between him and the America's 
Cup.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With 15:20 left in Wednesday night's first-round game of NCAA West Regional 
women's basketball tournament, UCLA seemed to have everything under control. 
DeDe Mosman's three-point shot had given the Bruins a 53-37 lead against No. 22 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
But Arkansas countered with a full-court press that started a 20-5 run and 
eventually led to a 90-80 Arkansas victory in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't handle the full-court pressure," UCLA Coach Billie Moore said. 
"We had a couple of players playing out of position with the injury to our 
point guard (Nicole Anderson). I was hoping they wouldn't exploit that, but 
they did." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, making its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1985, ends the season 
with a 17-12 record. Arkansas (23-4) advances to a second-round game at Georgia 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas appeared to have it won in regulation when Christi Willson made both 
ends of a one-and-one with seven seconds left to give the Razorbacks a 75-72 
lead. But the Bruins' Rachelle Roulier hit a desperation 28-footer at :01 to 
tie the game at 75-75 and force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Sheri Bouldin scored the first point in overtime on a free throw, but 
Arkansas countered with a field goal by Blair Savage and UCLA never led again. 
</P>
<P>
Rehema Stephens, a 5-foot-11 sophomore guard from Oakland, led UCLA with 16 
points. Sandra VanEmbricqs, Mosman and Bouldin added 13 points each. 
Van-Embricqs and Bouldin grabbed 10 rebounds each. 
</P>
<P>
Delmonica DeHorney and Amber Nicholas had 22 points for Arkansas.

CALIGIURI, WYNALDA FINALLY SIGN CONTRACTS WITH SOCCER FEDERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The impasse between the U.S. Soccer Federation and Paul Caligiuri ended 
Wednesday with the announcement that the midfielder from Santa Monica has 
signed a standard player's contract. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the federation announced at a news conference in New York 
that forward Eric Wynalda of Westlake Village also has signed. 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri, 25, and Wynalda, 20, have been two of the most effective players in 
preparation for the U. S. national team's first World Cup in 40 years this 
summer in Italy. Caligiuri scored one goal and assisted on another in 
Saturday's 2-1 victory over Finland at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Initially offered a contract in December, Caligiuri refused to sign because of 
a requirement that professional teams pay transfer fees to the USSF if they 
sign U.S. players before the contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
Caligiuri, who previously played in West Germany, wanted to be released from 
the contract after the World Cup. The USSF has the players under contract for 
the remainder of this year with an option for next year. RANDY HARVEY

MISTER FRISKY KIN IN MUCH DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the unbeaten 3-year-old colt Mister Frisky has established himself as 
the prerace favorite for the Kentucky Derby -- at least among members of the 
media who are crying for a fresh angle -- a few things need to be pointed out 
about his heritage. 
</P>
<P>
He is not a "Puerto Rican" horse. Nor is he a Son of San Juan, a Caribbean 
Comet, or any other condescending variation on an already exhausted theme. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Mister Frisky did win all 13 of his races in Puerto Rico before taking the 
San Vicente and San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita this winter. And yes, his 
owners, Jose and Marta Hernandez, are natives of the island territory. But 
Mister Frisky is American mainland through and through, a son of a blue-blooded 
Kentucky stallion who was bred, foaled and sold in Florida before going on to 
become the King of El Commandante. 
</P>
<P>
Still raking in favorable reviews from his victory in the March 3 San Rafael, 
Mister Frisky is not scheduled to run again until the $500,000 Santa Anita 
Derby on April 7. In the meantime, a veritable cottage industry has grown up 
around the chestnut colt, with bloodstock agents from all over the world 
ferreting out members of his immediate family to buy, sell or otherwise chip 
off a piece of the rock. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past two months, two of Mister Frisky's sisters have changed hands 
and several shares of his sire, Marsayas, have been sold for as much as $5,000 
apiece. Such is the magnetic power of a potential Derby colt at the top of the 
family tree, for nothing that came before Mister Frisky could justify such 
interest in his genetic relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mister Frisky's breeders, Dr. Ronald Chak and family of Ocala, Fla., are 
more than a little bit amazed at what the colt has been able to accomplish, 
based on his family ties. 
</P>
<P>
"As an individual, he did not stand out," said Dr. Chak's son, Roger, who 
manages their Newchance Farm. "And to look at his pedigree, there was really 
nothing there. . . When he went for $15,000 as a 2-year-old last April he most 
certainly outsold his pedigree." 
</P>
<P>
The Chaks lost track of Mister Frisky once he went to Puerto Rico to begin his 
racing career. Word trickled back to Florida of his initial success last 
summer, but they were not particularly suspicious when a man named Gilberto 
Umpierre called them from San Juan with an offer to buy Frisky Flyer, Mister 
Frisky's dam. 
</P>
<P>
Frisky Flyer, who raced in the late 1970s, had some success on the track for 
Newchance Farm. She won five of 20 starts, mostly on the bush track circuit of 
the Ohio River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold her, because that's the business we're in," said Roger Chak. "It would 
have been nice to have had more reliable information on Mister Frisky at the 
time, but the racing authorities in Puerto Rico are pretty slow in getting it 
to our Jockey Club. As a result, Frisky Flyer was gone before we really knew 
what the colt had turned out to be." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Chaks could take some consolation. They had control of Mister 
Frisky's two sisters, didn't they? 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we'd sold his full sister, Miss Frisky Lady, for $13,000 as a 
2-year-old," said Roger Chak. "But we took her back when they didn't like what 
the X-rays showed on her knees. She ended up winning a couple races for us 
before we retired her. 
</P>
<P>
"The fellow who bought into Marsayas, Mr. (Romulado) Olazabal, offered to buy 
her from us earlier this year, before Mister Frisky won the San Vicente," Chak 
went on. "My father put what he thought was an outrageous price on her -- 
$50,000 -- which was about 10 times more than she was worth based on her 
pedigree and her racing record. But the guy paid the price." 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky's other sister is named Miss Frisky. She never made it to the 
races. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we'd sold her for $600 last year," said Roger Chak. "With all this 
happening recently, I thought I'd better get on the phone and hunt her down. 
</P>
<P>
"I found her just south of us in Bartow, owned by some woman who'd bred her to 
a quarter horse. Hooked up my trailer, drove through the sugar sand and picked 
her up for $1,000. We told the lady we'd give her back the quarter horse foal. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing was, that lady got a call the very next week from somebody in 
Puerto Rico, wanting to buy Miss Frisky, too," Chak added. "She must have been 
getting pretty suspicious by then." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky continued on target for the Santa Anita Derby with a 5-furlong 
workout Wednesday in one minute flat. . . . Ron Hansen has been granted 
permission to resume riding on Saturday by the Golden Gate board of stewards.

TOURNAMENT CASTS SEASON IN NEW LIGHT

The United States' largest office pool gets underway Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If baseball's Opening Day is the first sip from a tall glass brimming with a 
refreshing drink that will last all summer, the first round of the NCAA 
tournament is a shot glass of nitroglycerin. Throw it down, and . . . 
</P>
<P>
Boom! Georgetown 50, Princeton 49. 
</P>
<P>
Boom! Oklahoma 72, East Tennessee State 71. 
</P>
<P>
Boom! Siena 80, Stanford 78.

Slam, bam, jam!!! Forty-eight hours of almost continuous college hoops on ESPN, 
baybee!!!

<P>
If you can't bear to miss Thursday night's West Region game between Nevada-Las 
Vegas and Arkansas-Little Rock, you can catch it on tape at 3:30 Friday 
morning. Enjoy it while it lasts, though. CBS takes over the proceedings next 
year, and with "Nightwatch" and all ... . Well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
But back to this season. The season of the ACC-Big East Challenge series and 
the Big Eight challenge series. The season Florida's Gators lost their bite and 
Connecticut's Huskies sharpened their teeth. The season in which Purdue 
returned to a boil and Michigan State again was magical. The season of Kenny A 
and Jimmy V. The season of Bo Kimble and, sadly, of Hank Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday is the beginning of the end. After 19 days of pure, uncontrived 
emotion, a national champion will be crowned in Denver on April 2. Will the 
winner have been one of this season's best team? Maybe. But with a 
one-loss-and-you-go-home format and no teams without at least one identifiable 
weakness, it is possible none of the favorites will have the Rocky Mountain 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown, seeded third in the Midwest Region but vulnerable at small forward 
and when it can't impose its style, plays Texas Southern in its first-round 
game Friday at noon in Indianapolis. Virginia, seeded seventh in the Southeast 
Region, will try to extend Terry Holland's coaching career by defeating Notre 
Dame on Friday at 9:30 p.m. in Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are not the only team with a possible home-court advantage. 
Connecticut, seeded first in the East Region, plays Boston University Thursday 
at Hartford Civic Center -- site of seven Huskies games this season. Adding a 
little spice to this matchup is a feud between Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun 
and Boston University Coach Mike Jarvis that most recently dates back to what 
the Huskies call The Snow Game. 
</P>
<P>
In December 1986, en route to Boston, the Huskies' bus crashed into an 
unoccupied car on the Massachusetts Turnpike. The bus was seriously damaged, 
and Calhoun phoned ahead to ask that the game be canceled. Forget it, came the 
reply. The game started two hours late, and the Huskies lost. After the game, 
Calhoun said he never would play the Terriers again. 
</P>
<P>
Now Connecticut has an opportunity for revenge and to demonstrate it can 
contend for the national title without an excellent big man. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State has two big-time big men, Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley Roberts, 
as well as all-American guard Chris Jackson. But the Tigers play Villanova 
Thursday night in a Southeast Region game in Knoxville, Tenn. And the Wildcats 
have an 9-0 record in NCAA tournament opening-round games under Coach Rollie 
Massimino. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State, seeded first in the Southeast, also plays Thursday in 
Knoxville. This group of Spartans is inexperienced when it comes to NCAA 
tournament play, but the opening opponent is 16th-seeded Murray State. No 
16th-seeded or 15th-seeded team has won a first-round game since the tournament 
was expanded to 64 teams in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Princeton and East Tennessee State came close last season. Both are 
back this year as 13th-seeded teams. The Buccaneers, with 6-foot-11 junior 
center Greg Dennis and 5-7 junior point guard Keith "Mister" Jennings, play 
Georgia Tech Thursday night in Knoxville. The Yellow Jackets are viewed as a 
possible title contender, but with a poor game from one of their three guards 
-- Dennis Scott, Brian Oliver or Kenny Anderson -- they could be in trouble.

NFL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
NBA SALARY STRUCTURE DRAWS A CLOSER LOOK FROM MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM JENKINS, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

ORLANDO, Fla.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL, following the lead of the NBA, is proposing a salary cap for its 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Donlan, executive director of the NFL Management Council, said Wednesday 
the players would benefit because there would be a "guaranteed amount of money 
clubs would be required to spend." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, the NFL completed a new, mammoth, four-year television 
package with the three major networks and two cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
Donlan said if a formula were reached from "the money (the league) just 
received, the players will feel they're getting their fair share." 
</P>
<P>
The players, who have been without a collective-bargaining agreement since an 
unsuccessful strike in 1987, aren't expected to embrace the idea of a salary 
cap. Undoubtedly, they would view it as another cost-saving measure. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the NFL Players Association, frustrated in its attempt to reach a 
bargaining agreement, decertified itself as a union. NFLPA executive director 
Gene Upshaw said he thought the organization would benefit by abandoning its 
role as a bargaining agent. Upshaw hoped that total free agency would 
eventually result. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, Upshaw said he was hopeful progress could be made on a 
contract after conversations with new Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
Donlan, noting that NFL salaries are steadily increasing but still lagging 
behind basketball and baseball, said the league still recognizes the NFLPA as a 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers can get together anytime to meet," Donlan said, calling the 
decertification a ploy. "I'm sure they can go back into business the same way 
they went out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Donlan produced a chart that said the average NFL salary in 1989 was $304,000 
and the 12 highest-paid players on each team averaged $593,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to Donlan, who has access to team salary figures, the NBA's 12-man 
rosters averaged $600,000 last year. Taking the 24 highest-paid players on each 
club for 1989, Donlan said the NFL averaged $450,000 against $488,000 for 
major-league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Donlan also distributed a survey of players changing teams under Plan B free 
agency, a period that begins Feb. 1 and ends April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Donlan said 51 players will be wearing new uniforms this season. In 1989, 229 
players changed teams under Plan B, including a rash of late signings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys lead this year's signings with 13, followed by the New York 
Jets with five and the Los Angeles Raiders and Washington Redskins with four 
each. 
</P>
<P>
The New England Patriots, who haven't signed any players, lost the most, eight. 
The New Orleans Saints were next with five, including defensive back Dave 
Waymer, the only player to sign with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who have not lost any players, may be close to signing two more 
players and are looking at another. Vice president John McVay said Wednesday 
that he planned to meet with the 49ers' brain trust about signing two Atlanta 
Plan B entries, punter Rich Donnelly and center-guard Wayne Radloff. 
</P>
<P>
McVay said discussions also continue with Buffalo nose tackle Fred Smerlas. 
Coach George Seifert said the 49ers also have shown an interest in veteran 
Cleveland cornerback Hanford Dixon.

REDICAN ISN'T JUST OLDER, HE'S BETTER SINCE TEAMING WITH SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 45, an age when most race car drivers are thinking about hanging up their 
helmet and gloves, John Redican is experiencing a sprint car renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
Redican won the opening California Racing Assn. main event last month in 
Bakersfield and, going into Saturday night's opener at Ascot Park, leads the 
CRA standings with 379 points to 351 for Jerry Meyer of Chino, last year's 
runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Ron Shuman, without a victory after three races (two others 
were rained out), is fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Redican, who lives in Chatsworth with girlfriend/car owner Kathy Simpson, has 
been racing since 1968 but sees this year as his first serious challenge for a 
season championship. 
</P>
<P>
"With the start we got, and the support we're getting from our sponsors, this 
could turn out to be a fantastic year," Redican said. "It would be even more 
fantastic if we could win the final season at Ascot." Ascot is scheduled to 
close in November after 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe that just over a year ago, we were going to chuck it in 
and I was going to take a ride with someone else. The costs had escalated so 
fast that we couldn't sustain our car any longer." 
</P>
<P>
A phone call from Sherman Pickerell of Pick's Racing Engines in Irvine brought 
Redican and Simpson out of their contemplated retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick called and said he'd provide us with engines if we kept racing, and he 
wanted to do it anonymously," Redican said. "You don't find many sponsors like 
that. We were overwhelmed. Then Rose Noutary came along and said she wanted to 
help by getting us a chassis, so now she and Kathy are sort of co-owners and 
things couldn't be working out better. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to the track now believing that I can win. It wasn't always that way." 
</P>
<P>
Redican has been a racing junkie since he was 4 and his father, Skee, took him 
to Ascot Park and other tracks where he raced midgets and sprint cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to drive my mother nuts telling her I was going to drive a race car as 
soon as I was old enough," he said. "She'd had enough of racing with my dad and 
didn't really want me in it." 
</P>
<P>
Redican drove his first sprint car at the defunct Speedway 605 in Irwindale in 
1968, but outside of a victory in the Salute to Indy 100 at Ascot in 1977, he 
had little success until he met Kathy Simpson in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson came from a racing family and was a race enthusiast from the time she 
was a teen-ager. Although she drove stock cars, her dream had always been to 
own a sprint car, and she bought her first one in 1979. A year later, after 
obtaining a new Stanton chassis, she hired Redican to be her driver. 
</P>
<P>
Redican gives her credit for boosting his confidence and turning him into a 
winning driver. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathy came to me one night and said, 'You're lazy, you're not getting near as 
much out of the car as you should,' " he recalled. "She told me that she didn't 
want a driver who wasn't trying as hard as he could, that she didn't want 
someone who was content to cruise along in fourth or fifth place and be happy. 
Which, she said, was the way I was driving. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you can imagine how furious it made me. This was long before we started 
dating and it was a female car owner telling me I'd better shape up or move on. 
Of course, it turned out she was right, but it's hard to hear something like 
that when you're 36 or 37 and been racing all your life." 
</P>
<P>
Redican has 13 victories in CRA, 10 of them in the last three seasons. He won 
four races in 1987, one in 1988 -- when he fractured a knee in a hard crash at 
Ascot and missed part of the season -- four last year and one this year. He 
finished third and fourth in this year's other two races. 
</P>
<P>
Car reliability has been the key to Redican's recent success. Last year he 
started all 53 CRA races, a feat matched only by Jerry Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
"We only broke three times in 53 races, and we've only had two engine failures 
in 130 races in the last three years," he said. "That's a real testimony to the 
kind of engines (Chevy Donovans) we get from Pick." 
</P>
<P>
Redican, director of parts and service at Dixon Cadillac in Hollywood, does all 
the chassis work himself along with three volunteers -- Danny Grunkemyer, Jim 
Hudkins and Craig Stowell. 
</P>
<P>
Redican will face a stiff challenge Saturday night in the 30-lap main event. 
Three Arizonans -- Shuman, Lealand McSpadden and Billy Boat -- will race, along 
with local favorites such as Meyer, Rip Williams, Mike Sweeney and two-time 
champion Brad Noffsinger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny racing against Noffsinger," Redican said. "My first ride in a 
midget was for his dad, Ace Noffsinger. Brad was about 12 at the time and I 
raced midgets for Ace until Brad got older and took the ride and I went back to 
sprinters." 
</P>
<P>
Like most race drivers, Redican once thought of racing Indy cars or NASCAR 
stock cars, but now he is content to stick with Kathy and his sprint car. 
</P>
<P>
"At my age, it's more practical to be the big fish in the little pond than the 
other way around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDWAY BIKES -- National champion Bobby Schwartz will carry a big lead into 
the final round of the Coors Spring Classic series Saturday night at the Earl 
Warren Showgrounds in Santa Barbara. Schwartz, who won last week in Costa Mesa, 
has 66 points to 60 for Kelly Moran, who won the opener at Long Beach two weeks 
ago. . . . The weekly seasons will start March 30 at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, April 8 at Speedway USA in Victorville, May 3 at 
Ascot Park and May 16 at Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- Multi-national champion Rick Johnson will miss Saturday's 
Supercross at Las Vegas and next week at the Rose Bowl after breaking a finger 
in a fall last week at Daytona. Johnson, who missed most of the 1989 season, 
won the opening motos of the national 250cc outdoor series at Gainesville, 
Fla., and hopes to return to racing for the second round April 1 at Hangtown. . 
. . The CMC Amateur Nationals will be held this weekend at Glen Helen Park in 
San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS CARS -- The Jaguars and the Nissans will go at it again Saturday in the 
12 Hours of Sebring in Florida. Davy Jones, Jan Lammers and Andy Wallace drove 
their Jaguar XJR-12 to victory in the 24 Hours of Daytona, and Geoff Brabham, 
Bob Earl and Chip Robinson drove a Nissan GTP Turbo to victory at Miami. 
Brabham and Robinson are also defending champions in Sebring, where their 
victory last year was the first for a Japanese manufacturer in a major 
endurance race. 
</P>
<P>
Earl's share at Miami made him only the second driver to win in four major 
International Motor Sports Assn. categories (GTU, GTO, GTP and Camel Lights). 
Elliott Forbes-Robinson completed the sweep three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- The West Coast Super Comp Assn. will hold its second points race 
Saturday night at Bakersfield Raceway, 20 miles north of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Formula One Grand Prix bikes will race this weekend at Willow 
Springs Raceway with the American Road Racing Assn. holding a series of spring 
events.

WOODEN INJUN LEADS TRAINER GARCIA'S PARADE TO PIMLICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The "loaded" barn of trainer Carlos Garcia will be in business as usual 
Thursday when the 70-day spring meeting begins at Pimlico Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, second most successful trainer in the Laurel meet that ended Tuesday, 
will saddle the short-priced favorite, Wooden Injun, in the $60,000 Mister Diz 
Stakes. The race is a six-furlong sprint for Maryland-bred 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
The colt, bred by owner David Hayden, is among the strong candidates Garcia is 
training in several categories of young horses. 
</P>
<P>
Wooden Injun has won his two starts, both stakes, as a 3-year-old. He had two 
victories, a second and a third in four starts at age 2. 
</P>
<P>
In his last start, Wooden Injun nosed out his stablemate, Ebonizer, in the 
Dancing Count Stakes on Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Wooden Injun is by Baederwood, sire of stakes winners Bea Quality and Miracle 
Wood. His dam, Barrera's Charm, is a daughter of Barrera, one of the fastest 
sprinters who ever came out of the West. 
</P>
<P>
A son of Raise A Native, named for trainer Laz Barrera by breeder Louis 
Wolfson, Barrera broke track records on both coasts. His 1:07 2-5 in the 1977 
Premiere Handicap was still the record for six furlongs when the Hollywood Park 
course was altered for the 1984 Breeders' Cup. In 1978, at 5, Barrera won the 
Tobbogan at Aqueduct in 1:08 4-5, a track record. 
</P>
<P>
Wooden Injun first attracted attention last Aug. 25, when he ran away by 17 
lengths in a six-furlong race at Laurel. He led by 10 at the eighth pole and 
Kent Desormeaux could have gotten him home sooner than his 1:11 clocking if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
(Possibly topping that, Garcia has a 3-year-old filly who won her first start 
last Saturday by 18 lengths. Pretty Flame, by the good sprinter Mt. Livermore, 
went the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:17 4-5, a second faster than allowance horses had 
done it two races earlier.) 
</P>
<P>
One of Wooden Injun's defeats was by Smelly, a Maryland-bred who will head the 
field for the $200,000 Federico Tesio at Pimlico Saturday. Smelly left Wooden 
Injun seven lengths behind in the seven-furlong Bimelech. 
</P>
<P>
Smelly was a strong second in Gulfstream's Fountain of Youth on March 3. He may 
be Maryland's only Triple Crown contender, though trainer Charles Peoples has 
hopes for Baron De Vaux, who won the 1 1-16-mile Private Terms at Laurel the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1-16-mile Tesio will include a tempting long shot. Trainer Mert Bailes, 
who almost never asks too much of his horses, is entering J.R.'s Horizon, who 
is eligible for non-winners of two other than maiden. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Jim Ryan's Belmont winner Caveat, J.R.'s Horizon won a 1 1-16-mile 
allowance last Friday. In similar races in his previous two starts he was 
second to Baron De Vaux by three quarters and to Gala Swinger by a head. 
</P>
<P>
It took J.R.'s Horizon three months and six races to break his maiden, but 
lately he seems to be getting the idea. Anyway, he has given Bailes an idea.

RICK DU BROW: THE NEWS CHALLENGE: L.A.'S NEW ETHNIC MIX; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NO STATION HAS AS YET BECOME THE MAINSTREAM VOICE OF MINORITIES, 
SUCH AS LATINOS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND BLACKS, WHO ARE RAPIDLY TURNING INTO THE 
MAJORITY.

It had to be embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
From 10 to 11 p.m. Monday, KCAL Channel 9's ballyhooed, $30-million news 
operation and its $1-million anchor, Jerry Dunphy, averaged less than a 1 
rating, according to the A.C. Nielsen research firm. 
</P>
<P>
To be exact, it scored a 0.6 rating, which means only about 30,000 TV homes in 
the Greater Los Angeles area watched the final third of KCAL's nightly, 
three-hour prime-time newscast. 
</P>
<P>
KCAL's share of the audience for that final hour averaged 1%, which meant that 
only one out of every 100 homes with the TV on was watching Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
And on Tuesday, there was further embarrassment in the same hour. While the 
numbers were up slightly to a 1.2 rating and 2% share, the last quarter hour 
sank to a 0.2 and a zero share in the Arbitron statistics -- suggesting 
strongly that virtually nobody in L.A. was tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, KTLA Channel 5's regular 10 to 11 p.m. news on Monday, anchored by 
Hal Fishman, scored a 6.3 Nielsen rating, which translates to about 300,000 TV 
homes -- 10 times the audience of the new, Disney-owned KCAL operation. On 
Tuesday, KTLA pulled a 5.6. 
</P>
<P>
What to do if you're KCAL? Throw up your hands? Of course not. The 11-day-old 
newscast is simply getting an ultra-fast lesson in the killer competition of 
L.A.'s television market, which is increasingly mercurial. As many people move 
farther and farther from the city's core, viewing priorities change. In 
addition, a new multi-ethnic influx has dramatically altered the makeup of the 
Southland audience. 
</P>
<P>
It's a challenge to all of L.A.'s TV stations as their overall ratings slide. 
And while they promise to increase coverage in outlying areas, none has really 
taken the bold step of breaking from the pack and becoming the definitive 
mainstream TV station of the new Los Angeles -- where minorities such as 
Latino, Asian-Americans and blacks are turning into the majority. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census figures, when they eventually come out, may cause significant 
changes in local TV coverage because the new population trends will be 
officially confirmed and established, a solid advertising base and a reason for 
editorial adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, KCAL, despite its expected rough start -- and if Disney stands 
behind it -- may well be in the best possible position to seize the initiative 
in covering the new L.A. because it is not locked into the formats and 
traditions of the past. If it's going to get whipped -- and it will -- while 
growing, it might as well put its money on the future of L.A. with a nightly 
newscast that simply looks different from the past. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at the diversity and richness of this entire area," says KCAL 
News Director Bob Henry. 
</P>
<P>
And, though a fledgling on the L.A. scene, KCAL nonetheless debuted with an 
utterly wonderful report that epitomized exactly the direction the station 
should be taking -- a story of Vietnamese, which had to be moving not only to 
those who came here from their homeland, but also to all of us. For the new 
L.A. is changing our daily experiences. 
</P>
<P>
KCAL's Vietnamese report was extraordinary for what it promised, perhaps 
accidentally. Launching a five-part series, it offered a 7-minute report -- 
ideal for the roomy, three-hour format -- that included emotional scenes of 
Vietnamese children talking through tears in their own language. The stroke of 
genius was letting them go on and on, without translation. Kids sound the same 
in any language, reporter David Jackson said wisely. 
</P>
<P>
If you were Vietnamese and living in L.A., you might well have been thinking: 
This is a station I must look at again. And if you were an old-time Angeleno, 
trying to keep up with the new L.A., you couldn't help feel a bit more plugged 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are countless TV reports of L.A.'s so-called Third World 
melting pot, often dealing with its problems. Television stations are adept at 
focusing on gangs, drugs and misery -- only the faces change. 
</P>
<P>
But what is missing is the textured reporting that paints a day-in, day-out 
portrait of what is happening around us, the less sensational but significant 
developments that are remaking our city. What more perfect place for such 
reporting than a three-hour prime-time newscast? What an opportunity for a TV 
station to build a new audience -- a new constituency -- all its own. 
</P>
<P>
No one's doing it, though, among the major stations. But there are signs of 
awakening. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Hispanic community's a third of viewership in the whole viewing 
area," says KCBS Channel 2 News Director Michael Singer. "We're about to do 
Spanish simulcasts for our 5 and 6 p.m. news to begin with, in the next few 
months. And we just hired Mike O'Connor, a former CBS reporter who's fluent in 
Spanish and who'll cover immigrant life in Los Angeles on an ongoing basis, and 
that doesn't exclude other groups such as Asians." 
</P>
<P>
Singer adds that in-depth reports on the impact of L.A.'s growing ethnic scene 
are "a good idea. We don't do enough of those stories in any neighborhood, 
whether minority or not. Frankly, it's our loss that we don't. It diminishes 
our newscasts. There's a kind of thinness. We don't have enough resources. 
We're constantly doing the news stories of the day." 
</P>
<P>
KCAL's Henry isn't certain about how much of a beat to make "the new L.A. But 
we're looking for areas in town that are underreported or aren't often on 
television. We would hope to give a richer profile, more texture, more depth. 
We have the resources, the people." 
</P>
<P>
Ratings figures on the minority viewing audience in the Greater Los Angeles 
area are compelling. For Latinos, they range from 21% to 28% of TV homes in 
various surveys, but some feel Singer's 33% estimate is closer to the truth and 
that the 1990 census may indicate it is higher than imagined. A ratings survey 
also says that blacks make up about 9% of TV homes. 
</P>
<P>
Figures for the Asian-American TV audience also vary, mainly because there are 
so many different communities with different languages. But statistics in a 
1988 survey suggest the size of the potential audience by offering rough 
estimates of some Asian-American groups in just Los Angeles County -- 350,000 
Filipinos, at least 300,000 Koreans, 188,000 Japanese, 170,000 Chinese, 110,000 
Thais, 60,000 Samoans, 50,000 Cambodians, 42,000 Vietnamese and 30,000 
Laotians. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA News Director Jeff Wald says, "We hired a planning editor not only for 
advance stories but to look into areas where we were weak, and also ethnic 
communities, the emerging L.A. We do a lot of marketing research and find there 
are opportunities to increase our audience. When we have to cover a gang story 
or tragedy, we try to cover two or three more positive things in the area." 
</P>
<P>
TV coverage of L.A. minority communities has a history of inadequacy. In 1983, 
a tornado that roared through South-Central L.A. got absurdly insufficient 
attention from local stations; if it had hit Rodeo Drive, they would have 
pulled programs for hours and been all over the story. To this day, inadequacy 
remains; KCAL's Pat Harvey is the only regular weeknight anchor on a major L.A. 
station who is black. 
</P>
<P>
But some things are changing. KSCI Channel 18 has blossomed as a station that 
caters to the area's exploding international population, especially 
Asian-Americans. On Monday night at 9, for instance, it will offer a live 
broadcast of the Jimmie Awards, which "acknowledge the depiction of 
Asian/Pacific Americans in a balanced and realistic light." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, CBS made a far-sighted pilot for a TV drama series -- "Fort Figueroa," 
in which an Iowa family lost its farm and inherited an L.A. apartment building 
with Vietnamese and Latino tenants. Directed by Luis Valdez and starring 
Charles Haid, it had a wonderful script that caught the change that was in the 
air here. Unfortunately, the show didn't sell, but it had vision. 
</P>
<P>
And vision is the key to producing L.A.'s winning TV news coverage of the 
1990s. All that's needed now is for a far-sighted station to see the future and 
grab it, because it's already upon us.

'TODAY' TAKES A PLUNGE AFTER PAULEY EXIT; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: DIAL-SPINNING SETS IN AS THE NBC PROGRAM LOSES ITS LEAD IN THE 
USUALLY STABLE MORNING NEWS MARKET.

<P>
In morning television, where viewing habits are as traditional as orange juice 
and coffee, the "Today" show lately has been waking up to a cold shower in the 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jane Pauley departed and was replaced by Deborah Norville as co-anchor on 
the 38-year-old NBC show, "Today" has been replaced by ABC's "Good Morning 
America" as the top-rated network morning news show, with "Today" losing a 
surprising 10% of its rating in one three-week period. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, "GMA" topped a nine-week winning streak in the Nielsen ratings, 
claiming its first victory over "Today" in a February sweeps period since 
November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For the month of February, one of four times a year when the ratings of every 
station in the country are measured to determine advertising rates, "Good 
Morning America's" average viewership was 4.1 million homes a day -- 
representing 21% of the audience watching TV at that time. "Today" had 3.3 
million homes and 17% of the audience. And "CBS This Morning" had 2.5 million 
homes and 12% of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to February of last year, "Today's" ratings were down 22% while "GMA" 
was up 7%. CBS, the longtime third-place program, was up 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Although early-morning news programs usually lose some viewers when they change 
anchors, ratings experts say that the "Today" plunge indicates viewers are 
reacting emotionally to the soap opera that was played out on "Today" over the 
past year -- from anchor Bryant Gumbel's infamous in-house memo to NBC's 
handling of the Norville hiring. 
</P>
<P>
"NBC tried to fix something that fundamentally wasn't broken," said Janet 
Patterson, the director of research for WBZ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Boston. 
"Morning shows are a companion to viewers. They didn't like what had happened 
to Jane Pauley, and they acted on it by voting with their TV dials." 
</P>
<P>
WBZ has been one of the most successful "Today" show stations, Patterson said, 
ranking No. 1 in the Boston market even when "Today" was No. 3 in the national 
Nielsen ratings. "Boston is a town of traditions, and people here have been 
loyal to 'Today' since the days of J. Fred Muggs," she said, referring to the 
chimp that used to be on the show when Dave Garroway was host. But in the past 
few months, "Today's" ratings in Boston have paralleled the drop in the 
national Nielsens. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that the race began to heat up at about the same time as the Gumbel 
memo (about a year ago)," Patterson said. "But what clearly hurt us was 
unhappiness over Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel's memo, written in response to then-"Today" producer Marty Ryan's 
request to evaluate the elements of the show, created a barrage of publicity 
after a newspaper published it because Gumbel was particularly critical of 
another member of the show's on-air "family" -- weatherman Willard Scott. 
</P>
<P>
And when NBC executives, in a bid for younger viewers, hired Norville last year 
as the show's news anchor, which ultimately led to Pauley's stepping down as 
co-anchor, Norville was portrayed and perceived as a younger, blonder rival. 
</P>
<P>
Rightly or wrongly, according to CBS research, the negative publicity over 
Gumbel's memo and Norville's hiring may be washing over into viewers' 
perceptions of the "Today" co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
According to David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president of research and 
marketing, Gumbel and Norville are the only morning-news anchors who recently 
have shown "a significant negative component" in CBS' tracking of audience 
attitudes towards the morning hosts. Noting that viewers generally rank news 
anchors favorably, Poltrack said that, in the case of Gumbel and Norville, a 
number had rated them either "fair" or "poor." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' research also shows that viewers recently have been showing unusual signs 
of dial-switching among the morning shows, where "GMA" has remained stable with 
hosts Charles Gibson and Joan Lunden, while "CBS This Morning" has shown 
improvement in the ratings and has recently hired "GMA's" news anchor Paula 
Zahn to replace Kathleen Sullivan as anchor with Harry Smith. As the 
third-place entrant in the race, Poltrack said, CBS hopes to benefit from that 
sampling. 
</P>
<P>
At first-place "Good Morning, America," researchers maintain that they are not 
merely benefiting from the bad publicity at "Today." Noting that "GMA" had been 
leading "Today" among young women for some time, Alan Wurtzel, ABC's senior 
vice president in charge of audience research, said, "There's no question that 
Pauley's departure has had an effect, but we were in a position to take 
advantage of that opportunity. We had our personalities and segments in place 
so that people, when they came over and looked at the show, liked what they 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Barbara Walters, scheduled to air Friday on ABC's "20/20," 
Gumbel acknowledged, "We've had a series of incidents that have projected the 
show in a poor light. And we've been on top for five years. That makes you a 
very convenient target. Between the memo, the changeover of people, there's 
just been a kind of firestorm." 
</P>
<P>
Given the slow-burning nature of change in morning TV, the question for "Today" 
is how and when that firestorm will be put out. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Capra, who took over as executive producer on Jan. 29, predicts that the 
program has hit the bottom of the recent ratings trend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we may have reached our low point last week," said Tom Capra, who 
formerly was news director at KNBC Channel 4 in Los Angeles. "There is a lot of 
sampling going on, but we think viewers will rediscover us. It's time to quit 
blaming Deborah Norville for Jane Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
Norville has been criticized by some TV reviewers for seeming to lack Pauley's 
warmth and chemistry with Gumbel and for sometimes rushing through her 
interviews. Since he joined the show, Capra said, "I don't think the program 
races any more -- it seemed to be relentless in the past. Bryant and Deborah 
have more time to talk to each other. We're exposing ourselves more to the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
"Today" will travel to Los Angeles for the Oscars later this month, but Capra 
said that he plans no major revamp of the series or any changes in the on-air 
talent.

'HUNTER' RERUNS SLAY DAN RATHER AND SITCOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When "Hunter" first hit the air in 1984, the initial episodes were so ridiculed 
by critics and so ignored by viewers that the police series was nearly 
canceled. Now in syndication, the same episodes are again proving to be lethal 
-- lethal, that is, to all of "Hunter's" Los Angeles competitors. 
</P>
<P>
In the recently concluded February ratings sweeps, reruns of "Hunter" won the 
highly competitive 6-7 p.m. time period for KTLA Channel 5, beating local news, 
national news and high-priced syndicated sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
On an average night, "Hunter" was seen in about 150,000 more homes than KCAL 
Channel 9's "Who's the Boss?" and in nearly 250,000 more homes than Dan 
Rather's national newscast on KCBS Channel 2, according to the Arbitron ratings 
service. 
</P>
<P>
That is, by all accounts, a remarkable showing, considering the current 
industry tenet that hourlong programs simply do not work in syndication -- and 
considering that the show cost KTLA less than 10% of what KCAL and KCOP Channel 
13 paid for reruns of "Who's the Boss?" and "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, original episodes of "Hunter" continue to crush the other two 
networks in the show's sixth season on NBC. So far this season, "Hunter" is the 
25th highest rated prime-time program, attracting 29% of the available audience 
on Saturdays at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The show is also a smash abroad. Fred Dryer, a former defensive lineman for the 
Los Angeles Rams who stars as LAPD Sgt. Rick Hunter, said this week that when 
he visits France, for example, "people there are literally foaming about the 
show." "Hunter" is also enormously popular in China, South America, Scandinavia 
and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a series that was called "despicable" and "criminally bad" when it 
premiered. 
</P>
<P>
"It hits a theme that people all seem to understand," said Dryer, who also is 
co-executive producer of the series. "The characters Hunter and (his partner) 
McCall have old-line values -- honesty, integrity. They are after the right 
answers to problems and the way they go about their jobs is very admirable. 
They are human beings. They aren't automatons. 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe it's just that they think I'm cute. Maybe they think Stepfanie 
(Kramer, who plays McCall) is beautiful. It's hard to put your finger on 
exactly why the show is so strong, but people are rediscovering it in 
syndication and giving us a whole new life." 
</P>
<P>
It's also breathing at least a little life into a genre that, in terms of 
syndication, had been presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of 'Hunter' has sparked a whole new interest in the 
action/adventure genre," boasted Pat Kenney, president of Televentures, which 
has syndicated the show in 87 markets across the country. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, hourlong network programs have found the world of syndication 
a wasteland. The producers of even hit shows such as "Murder, She Wrote" and 
"Moonlighting" have been forced to sell their repeats at reduced rates to 
basic-cable networks because they couldn't get decent prices from the broadcast 
stations that traditionally had been their primary buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Most hour shows are produced for 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. on the network for a 
different audience than what's available in early fringe (5-8 p.m.)," said Rick 
Feldman, station manager of KCOP Channel 13. "Shows like 'Hill Street Blues' 
are designed for you to watch with the lights out; you have to pay attention. 
Those shows tend to have trouble at the dinner hour with everything that is 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, independent stations have invested heavily in repeats of network 
sitcoms to fill their early evening schedules. Sources say that Channel 13 paid 
in excess of $300,000 per half-hour episode for reruns of "The Cosby Show" and 
that Disney-owned Channel 9 paid even more than that for reruns of "Who's the 
Boss?" By contrast, KTLA paid less than $60,000 per hour episode of "Hunter." 
</P>
<P>
The police show has benefited from this sitcom mania, especially in Los 
Angeles, where the other three independents all compete from 6 to 7 p.m. with 
sitcoms. The three network-owned stations all program news. 
</P>
<P>
"When you take a strong action/adventure show with a charismatic star such as 
Tom Selleck or Fred Dryer and put it up against three sitcoms, inevitably the 
sameness of the other three will cancel each other out," said Steve Bell, 
KTLA's general manager. "It's gotten to the point that if a viewer doesn't want 
to watch sitcoms and doesn't want to watch news, their only alternative is 
'Hunter.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bell said that once hour programs began to be perceived as "bad buys," stations 
began to bid up the cost of sitcoms astronomically. Hourlong action shows, 
meanwhile, can be had dirt cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is very funny," he said. "It's run by a herd mentality. Monkey 
see, monkey do. Stations want easy, risk-free answers. So they pay a king's 
ransom for those sitcoms and think they will avoid the risk. Sitcoms do work, 
but not when you have three up against each other. They aren't foolproof. At 
least not here." 
</P>
<P>
"Hunter" is the rare hourlong show, Bell conceded, that could produce such 
results in syndication. He predicted that such current network dramas as 
"thirtysomething," "Midnight Caller" and even the extremely popular "L.A. Law" 
will find no buyers outside of cable. The only current hourlong prime-time 
series with a good shot at drawing respectable audiences in syndication, he 
said, are "21 Jump St.," which Channel 5 has already bought, and "MacGyver," 
which already has been sold to cable's USA network. 
</P>
<P>
The drawbacks to any hourlong show, both Feldman and Bell pointed out -- even 
one as strong as "Hunter" -- is that they do not wear as well as sitcoms. 
"Magnum, P.I." also scored big ratings for Channel 5 a few years ago, but after 
the station had aired each episode a couple of times, ratings plunged. 
Meanwhile, the sitcom "Three's Company" is still doing well for KTTV Channel 
11, even after eight years of repeats. 
</P>
<P>
"You can keep laughing at episodes of 'Lucy,' but when you know the plot of an 
action/adventure show, you won't watch," Bell said. "But the hours are priced 
so low that if you get two years out of it, you have the equivalent of five 
years of a sitcom." 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is longevity," countered Feldman, who, like the managers 
of many stations across the country, has come under fire for paying so much for 
"Cosby." "That's why 'Three's Company' is one of the most successful shows in 
television history. Whatever they (KTTV) paid, it's an absolute gold mine." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said that no station will again fork over the kind of money paid for 
"Cosby" or "Who's the Boss?", not even for a smash show such as "Roseanne." 
During the bidding frenzy over "Cosby," he explained, station managers hadn't 
realized that the audience had been so irreversibly fractionalized that huge 
ratings are no longer possible for any series. 
</P>
<P>
But Feldman said that while "Hunter" has proven a great buy for KTLA, the 
sitcoms still outperform it in the 18-49 demographic, the age group that most 
advertisers prefer to reach. "Hunter" has a slightly older audience. 
</P>
<P>
As for "Hunter" itself, changes are already being plotted for the seventh 
season next fall. Kramer has decided to leave the show this spring to pursue a 
career in music, and so, Dryer said, he will cast a new actress in a new role 
to fill the void. Sgt. Hunter will be transfered from the homicide unit to a 
beat cop, allowing for more action, he added. 
</P>
<P>
While Dryer is thrilled by the ongoing popularity of his series, it angers him 
that critics and the industry here in Los Angeles have not seen fit to 
acknowledge any of the show's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even get one Emmy nomination. They don't even call to ask Stepfanie 
or me to be presenters. I begin to take it personally after awhile. I guess 
because we come from Stephen J. Cannell's company, they think of it as an 
'A-Teamish' type of show aimed at teen-age boys, but our audience is mostly 
adults -- 35 and older," he said. "The strong showing in syndication is 
satisfying to me because it shows us that we're appreciated by the people out 
there, even if we aren't appreciated by our own industry."

CRITIC AT LARGE: CINEMATOGRAPHERS EDGE INTO THE LIMELIGHT;

OSCARS: THE DISTINCTIVE STYLES OF THE FIVE NOMINEES AMPLY DEMONSTRATE WHY THE 
CRAFT'S STOCK IS RISING.

There are frequent complaints that the Academy Award telecast is too long. In 
fact, the agreement between the motion-picture academy and the ABC network 
stipulates that the show cannot be less than three hours long. How else to get 
in all those commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are suggestions that some of the "lesser" awards be sent by mail 
-- a thought greeted by rightful indignation in the industry. What is Batman 
going to do without special effects, take the stairs? And what would "The Hunt 
for the Red October" and any number of other films do without their apt and 
ingenious sound effects? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, audiences are smarter all the time about the work of the 
below-the-line technicians who don't get salads named after them but without 
whom movies would have only a fraction of their impact. Viewers have even come 
to realize that the actors don't make up the words, and certainly not the 
deeds, as they go along. There are writers, dyspeptic but ever-hopeful, 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the latest craft to win a widening recognition outside the industry 
ghetto are the cinematographers. It is clear that, subject matter and location 
aside, all films do not look alike. In black-and-white days, you couldn't 
mistake the contrasty and menacing shadows of a Warners film with the sunny, 
creamy lights of a typical MGM film. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the cinematographers are more often known as lighting cameramen 
and, in a way, it's a more fitting title; it's not the taking of the images 
that counts, it's the shaping of the light. 
</P>
<P>
The differences are subtler in these days of color and the technological 
challenges more dramatic, involving as they frequently do the melding of live 
action with special effects. 
</P>
<P>
This year's five Academy Award nominees for cinematography suggest the range of 
the challenges and the contribution of the person behind the camera to the 
total picture. 
</P>
<P>
Mikael Salomon's images for "The Abyss," for example, involved mind-boggling 
difficulties of underwater action and of sequences done in claustrophobic 
spaces of the undersea vehicles. It's a film in which what you see counts for 
more than what you think or feel emotionally, and Salomon's work earned its 
nomination, along with the picture's other nominations for art direction, sound 
and visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
The commercially disappointing Paul Newman film, "Blaze," in which he played 
Louisiana politician Earl Long, received only one nomination, but it was for 
Haskell Wexler's cinematography. The nomination is his fifth and he has two 
Oscars, for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "Bound for Glory." He's also 
photographed films as various as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The 
Thomas Crown Affair." 
</P>
<P>
Wexler's approach is what could be called a poetic naturalism, events taking 
place in the seeming absence of artificial light or in the presence of whatever 
the available light was. It is cinematography that, seeking to conceal itself, 
has become a valued signature, as it is in "Blaze." 
</P>
<P>
"Medium Cool," Wexler's own feature, which was made during the tumultuous 
Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968 and placed fictional characters amid 
the actual chaos, prefigured the kind of dramatic re-creations of history 
Robert Richardson would be asked to photograph for Oliver Stone in "Born on the 
Fourth of July," and for which he received one of the film's eight nominations. 
The visual tasks, from a high school prom to grueling combat sequences, a 
rat-infested hospital and several riots, were, to say the least of it, varied 
and demanding. 
</P>
<P>
The German-born veteran cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who has shot 80 films 
in 27 years, including 15 with Rainer Werner Fassbinder, was nominated for "The 
Fabulous Baker Boys." Ballhaus moved to the United States in 1982 to do "Baby 
It's You" with John Sayles. For Martin Scorsese, he photographed "The Color of 
Money," "After Hours," "The Last Temptation of Christ" and, most recently, 
"Nice Fellas." His work on "Broadcast News" gave him his first Oscar 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Pfeiffer's sexy singing of "Makin' Whoopee" atop a grand piano, 
arguably the high point of "Baker Boys," was, Ballhaus pointed out the other 
day, a 360-degree camera orbit. "One of my favorite moves if it's right for the 
scene," Ballhaus said. The camera, like a dance partner, not only makes its 
circle but glides in and out and rises and falls -- echoing, in a sense, the 
eloquent writhings of the actress. 
</P>
<P>
The British veteran Freddie Francis, who won an Oscar for his work on "Sons and 
Lovers" in 1960, has been nominated for "Glory," the story of a black regiment 
in the Civil War. Francis also filmed "The Elephant Man" and such earlier 
black-and-white classics as "Room at the Top" and "Saturday Night and Sunday 
Morning." "The French Lieutenant's Woman," in color, was a remarkable blending 
of a modern reality and an historic romanticism. "Glory" is its own blending -- 
of intimacy and scale -- and the battle scenes Francis photographed are quite 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
As in many other categories of the Academy Awards this year, it is well nigh 
impossible to predict where the Oscar for cinematography might go. And, too, as 
in other categories, there are allowable tips of the hat to cinematographers 
who didn't make the cut but might have: Miroslav Ondricek of "Valmont," John 
Seale of "Dead Poets Society," John A. Alonzo of "Steel Magnolias," Robert 
Yeoman of "Drugstore Cowboy," Ernest Dickerson of "Do the Right Thing," to name 
a second five.

POLITICS: THE LONG BEACH CITY COUNCIL SIDESTEPS AN ATTEMPT TO BAR ERNIE KELL 
FROM HOSTING A CABLE TV PROGRAM WHILE RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has declined to get involved in a political dispute between 
Mayor Ernie Kell and one of his challengers, Councilman Tom Clark, over Kell's 
regular appearances on a publicly funded cable television program. 
</P>
<P>
Clark asked the council this week to bar local elected officials such as Kell 
from appearing on special programming on the city's Channel 21 while they are 
running for office. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is wrong," Clark said, referring to Kell's regular appearance on 
"Keys to the City," a local public-affairs program that Kell hosts. "It's 
unfair to other candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Council members, saying the middle of a campaign was not the time to deal with 
the matter, shelved Clark's request while indicating that the matter would be 
taken up later when a council committee considers various campaign reform 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Kell argued that his appearance on the show has been deemed legal by the city 
attorney and the state Fair Political Practices Commission, that, as mayor, it 
is legitimate for him to host a show dealing with city problems, and that 
Clark's charges are purely political. 
</P>
<P>
"Keys to the City" is taped monthly and is shown six days a week on the city 
channel. The city pays for the show's $192,000-a-year production costs with 
money derived from franchise fees paid by Simmons Cable. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. John Calhoun quoted letters from the State Fair Political Practices 
Commission concluding that such publicly funded broadcasting does not violate 
Proposition 73, the state campaign reform initiative that bars politicians from 
sending their constituents publicly funded mass mailings, such as newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark, in a letter to his council colleagues, insisted that the broadcasts 
violated the spirit of Proposition 73, if not the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jan Hall agreed. "I do feel the expenditure of public monies 
during a campaign time is inappropriate and not what the voters voted for." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hall pointed out that the mayor of Norwalk, Grace Napolitano, stopped 
appearing on a similar public affairs show aired in her city after she filed 
for reelection to the Norwalk City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In other campaign matters, Clark and Kell appeared with the six other mayoral 
hopefuls at a candidates forum sponsored by the Long Beach Junior Chamber of 
Commerce Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Clark attacked Kell's leadership during his two years as the city's full-time 
mayor, asserting that Kell had done little on a variety of key city issues, 
ranging from police labor negotiations to the Harbor Commission's decision to 
spend about $1 million renovating its board room. 
</P>
<P>
"Real leadership would not sit by idly while business opportunities leave Long 
Beach, such as the auto mall. Real leadership would not allow the police 
negotiations to go on for nine months," Clark declared. 
</P>
<P>
"Real leadership is telling the Harbor Commission that our citizens don't want 
them to spend $1.2 million on their board room." 
</P>
<P>
Kell pointed to the establishment of the Offices of Education and Neighborhood 
and Historic Preservation as accomplishments of his first term, characterized 
crime as the city's leading problem and reiterated his opposition to airport 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Touching two issues on which he has frequently been criticized for inaction, 
Kell also mentioned the homeless and the shortage of low-cost housing as 
serious local problems, but he did not elaborate on what should be done about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates on the April 10 ballot offered their versions of the city's 
ills and cures. 
</P>
<P>
David E. Kaye argued that traffic congestion could be reduced if only the city 
would narrow its wide sidewalks. Joe F. Wise advocated less government and 
lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Rosenberg complained that the city's leaders are beholden to the wealthy 
developers and businessmen who finance their campaigns. He decried the ballot 
proposal to create a $7-million-a-year property tax levy to hire 75 more police 
officers as a "fiscal fiasco." Rosenberg said 160 additional officers are 
needed, but they should be paid for from the general fund, since they provide a 
basic city service. 
</P>
<P>
Write-in candidate Jim Wade condemned the city's treatment of the police union, 
while Lou Robillard maintained that crime would greatly decrease if criminals 
were shipped to the desert and kept there to build their own prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Perennial candidate Thomas (Ski) Demski, grasping his signature miniature 
American flag, closed his comments with an off-key song. 
</P>
<P>
"So vote for Skiiii Demski, Skiiii. Just vote for me. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no deals in this campaign. Vote for Skiiii Demski, Skiiii. . . ."

SETTLEMENT MAY CLEAR WAY FOR SEAY TO RESUME FOOTBALL 
</P>

Mark Seay, the Cal State Long Beach wide receiver who lost a kidney in a 
shooting, has settled his legal differences with the university and may be able 
to resume his football career, his attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the out-of-court settlement of Seay's lawsuit, the university agreed 
to allow Seay to play again if he is cleared in medical tests next week, said 
his attorney, Richard Foster. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty confident that Mark will be on the field," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
The tests will determine whether Seay's remaining kidney has stabilized and is 
working properly, the attorney said. Both sides have agreed not to discuss 
specifics of the settlement, according to a prepared statement disclosing the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Seay lost his right kidney after he was shot by a suspected gang member at a 
children's Halloween party in 1988. He became a hero for shielding his 
2-year-old niece from the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Last July he was told by the university that he couldn't play because the risk 
of injuring his remaining kidney was too great. 
</P>
<P>
He sued the school, but in September U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew denied 
Seay's request for an injunction ordering school officials to let him play for 
the 49ers last season. The judge said the evidence was unclear whether Seay's 
remaining kidney was functioning properly. 
</P>
<P>
The case had been expected to proceed to trial this month. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said that a test two weeks ago by C.C. Calescibetta, a Long Beach kidney 
specialist, revealed that Seay's creatinine clearance -- a measure of kidney 
function -- was functioning within normal limits. A test last July by Stewart 
W. Shankel, kidney specialist at Loma Linda University, yielded a similar 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Foster would not identify the doctor who will perform the tests, but said it 
would not be Calescibetta, Shankel or Robert Austin, the university doctor. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 season, as a sophomore, Seay caught 31 passes for 480 yards in 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
George Allen, the new 49er coach, had said recently that he hoped he would have 
Seay on his team. Neither Allen or other university officials were available to 
comment.

LAKEWOOD SEEKS COALITION OF CITIES ON WATER ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
City officials have decided to launch an ambitious effort to give Lakewood and 
other Southeast cities more clout with federal, state and local agencies that 
have authority over the area's water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to try to organize a coalition of up 
to 20 cities stretching from the Whittier Hills to Long Beach, including 
Downey, Bellflower, South Gate, Compton, Paramount, Montebello, Norwalk and 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition is the centerpiece of the city's "water resource management 
strategic plan," designed to preserve the quality and supply of its water, 95% 
of which comes from wells. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition -- an idea Lakewood must sell to its neighbors in the Los Angeles 
County Central Basin -- would represent the cities' interests before the myriad 
of public agencies that make decisions about water, such as the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, and 
the Central and West Basin Water Replenishment District. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that relates directly to the quality of life in Southern 
California," said James L. Easton, the consultant Lakewood hired last year to 
help draw up a plan for safeguarding the city's water. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood officials already have informally approached a few neighboring cities, 
and the response has been positive, said James B. Glancy, the city's director 
of water resources. Now that the council has adopted the strategic plan, Glancy 
added, the city can formally begin an organizing effort. 
</P>
<P>
In South Gate, the director of public works and engineering, Rollie D. Berry, 
said that Lakewood's call for a coalition is an excellent idea. "There's really 
no coalition among (the cities) to make their wants and needs heard through a 
common voice," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate had to close six of its 14 wells because of contamination from 
industrial solvents and recently issued $14.7 million worth of bonds to pay for 
their cleanup, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood and other cities want to maintain an adequate supply of good water for 
their residents, Easton said, but they cannot do that if the supply is 
threatened by events that happen along a river bank in Northern California or 
in a factory in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
"Aquifers don't know city boundaries," said Councilman Marc Titel, referring to 
the underground storage areas that move water and toxins miles from their 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
It has been determined by state and federal agencies, for example, that ground 
water underneath the Central Basin cities is threatened by toxins that were 
left in the ground decades ago by industries in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest toxic plumes, Easton said in an interview before the City 
Council meeting, has collected in the Whittier Narrows at the intersection of 
the 605 and 210 freeways, and it will slowly move southward. 
</P>
<P>
"This plume is pointing just like a gun at the Central Basin," said Easton, who 
is vice president of Willdan Associates, a statewide engineering and planning 
firm. He also is the former executive director of the State Water Resources 
Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
The site has been designated for cleanup by the federal government, but that 
will cost from $600 million to $800 million, Easton said. The federal 
government says it does not have money to pay for the cleanup, but a regional 
coalition of cities, he suggested, could begin lobbying federal and state 
lawmakers to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood's strategic water plan also calls for lobbying the state and federal 
governments to hire more staff in agencies that are responsible for identifying 
polluters and prosecuting them. 
</P>
<P>
"Preventing (pollution) is a lot less expensive than cleaning it up," Easton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another critical element in Lakewood's plan is to encourage the use of 
reclaimed water -- sewage water that has been treated and is used for watering 
landscaping. Cerritos, Lakewood and several other cities in the Southland 
already sell treated water to large users such as school districts and 
industrial parks. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the city to support the construction of the Peripheral 
Canal, which would transport water from Northern California rivers to Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood is believed to be the first city in the state to take such an active 
stance on water issues, Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
What made the city decide to champion the water issue? 
</P>
<P>
"We asked ourselves the same question," Titel said. "And I guess the answer is 
that nobody else is doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Titel, along with Councilman Robert Wagner and City Administrator Howard L. 
Chambers, was on the ad hoc committee the City Council set up last year to 
study water issues and come up with the strategic plan. The council on Tuesday 
converted the ad hoc body to a standing committee. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood, Titel acknowledged, is a relatively trouble-free community that 
prides itself on addressing critical issues before they become big problems. 
"Because there aren't a lot of problems, our staff is not fighting fires all 
the time. It allows our staff to be creative and think about problems like 
this," he said.

<P>
COUNCIL TO HEAR COMMENTS AT BEGINNING OF MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talking to the Long Beach City Council about non-agenda items will soon no 
longer be a matter of slow torture. 
</P>
<P>
The council is setting aside 30 minutes at the start of its weekly meetings to 
allow members of the public to comment on matters not listed on the regular 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, those wishing to make such comments have to wait until the end of 
the meeting, a wait that can sometimes consume most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I got fed up with waiting and waiting to speak," explained Sid Solomon, who, 
as political action chairman of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, often 
addresses the council. Solomon spearheaded the drive for an earlier public 
comment period, gathering the support of 20 local organizations and Councilman 
Evan Anderson Braude, who introduced the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The public comment period at the end of the meeting will remain, leaving anyone 
who misses the first period another chance to make remarks. An ordinance is 
being prepared to make the changes, which will not go into effect until the 
ordinance is passed.

COLUMNIST ELECTED LEADER OF LEGAL AID FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Press-Telegram columnist Bill Hillburg has been elected president of the Legal 
Aid Foundation of Long Beach, the first leader in the organization's 37-year 
history who is not an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Hillburg, who writes the newspaper's "Beachcomber" column three days a week, 
was unanimously elected to lead the organization that provides legal assistance 
in civil matters to the city's poor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will provide a new perspective to the organization. I am looking 
forward to the year," executive director Toby J. Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillburg is the only director on the 21-member board who represents the 
community at large; 13 members are lawyers and seven are clients. While staff 
attorneys decide which cases to accept and how to proceed with them, the board 
of directors sets legal policy and handles funding issues, Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillburg was a high school teacher and coach before he became a reporter. He 
has worked for the Press-Telegram since 1979 and became a member of the Legal 
Aid Foundation board last year.

COLLECTORS PROTEST CUTBACK IN PHILATELIC CENTER HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 stamp collectors picketed the Downey Post Office, 8111 Firestone 
Blvd., on Monday because the branch's Philatelic Center hours were reduced from 
20 to 12 a week. 
</P>
<P>
The special-service counter, once open five days a week, is now open four hours 
a day on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
The cutback was necessary because "customer traffic" did not justify the hours, 
post office spokeswoman Susan Manley said. 
</P>
<P>
Customers can purchase stamps at the regular branch windows when the philatelic 
center is closed. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by South Gate Councilman Gregory Slaughter, a stamp 
collector. Collectors from surrounding cities, including South Gate, Bell 
Gardens, Lynwood, Maywood and Huntington Park, use the center. 
</P>
<P>
They have received letters and resolutions from elected officials and stamp 
collectors supporting the group's effort to have the hours restored, Slaughter 
said. He said the group has 75 letters, including ones from Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-San Diego) and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles).

NEWSPAPER GUILD REJECTS LATEST CONTRACT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Press-Telegram reporters, maintenance workers and other employees have rejected 
the Long Beach company's latest contract offer by a 95-28 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said they object to a proposed clause that would prohibit job 
actions, such as boycotts or strikes, that could hurt the company economically 
while the contract is in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Newspaper Guild, which represents about 240 employees, 
currently is carrying out such a job action, asking readers to sign cards that 
would cancel their subscriptions if the union decides to turn them in. Union 
leaders said they have gathered about 1,500 pledges. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Rowell, the Press-Telegram's vice president of operations, said he was 
surprised and disappointed by the vote. The company "has no plan to go back to 
the bargaining table," he said. Todd Cunningham, president of the guild's 
local, said he was hopeful the two sides could meet again. "We do want a 
contract," Cunningham said. "And we're not very far. We hope they see it that 
way, too."

COMPTON BLVD. ALMOST A MEMORY AS REDONDO CHRISTENS MARINE AVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last mile of Compton Boulevard west of the Harbor Freeway was officially 
dubbed Marine Avenue last week, erasing from the South Bay a name that once 
coursed proudly all the way from the San Gabriel River to Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council, the last governing board in the South Bay to 
undertake the name change, cited confusion among residents over addresses in 
joining the rest of the area in renaming the thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Cawdrey noted that in the last two years, every other city in 
the South Bay through which the boulevard runs has changed its name to Marine 
Avenue. The only place west of the Harbor (110) Freeway where signs for Compton 
Boulevard exist is the Redondo Beach side of a mile-long stretch that forms the 
city's boundary with Hawthorne and Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
It is a slightly different story in the Southeast/Long Beach area, where 
Compton Boulevard continues to exist in Bellflower and Compton. However, 
Paramount in 1986 changed the name of the thoroughfare to Somerset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell somebody to turn right on Compton Boulevard and they miss it and end 
up in Torrance," Cawdrey said. But Stevan Colin, the only council member to 
vote against the name change, questioned the motives behind the trend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just kind of funny to me that in, like, Lawndale, they'd want to have a 
street named Marine," he said. "Or Hawthorne. What do those cities have to do 
with the ocean? 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope that the trend won't be that we start seeing proposals to change 
the names of other streets -- say, Inglewood Avenue," Colin added, referring to 
another city whose residents, like Compton's, are predominantly black. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has been controversial from its outset. It began in 1988, when a 
Gardena furniture store owner started a petition to rename his city's end of 
the boulevard. Chuck Nader said at the time that he wanted to eliminate 
confusion that had plagued him for the 20 years that his Gardena store was 
situated on a boulevard named for Compton, on the other side of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Nader's suggestion to rename the street for Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn fell through when Hahn objected. The city did go along with 
Nader's second choice, which was to follow the lead of Manhattan Beach, which 
has called the street Marine Avenue since the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, with lobbying from Nader and other businesses, was picked up by other 
cities, to the chagrin of Compton officials. In May, for example, Ted D. 
Kimbrough, the then-superintendent of the Compton Unified School District, 
wrote a scathing letter to the mayor of Hawthorne, calling the name change "a 
slap in the face to our community and its residents" and "an ill-disguised 
effort by those who have promoted the idea to disassociate themselves from the 
Compton community and all that it represents." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor responded with the argument that Hawthorne is part of the South Bay 
and "Marine Avenue is a name that is more identifiable with a South Bay city." 
</P>
<P>
But Compton officials remained unconvinced. In an interview with The Times in 
December, Robert Adams, a former Compton councilman, said the trend was based 
on racism, and added that the South Bay cities "don't want to be associated 
with the city of Compton." 
</P>
<P>
Nader could not be reached for comment but his son, Chuck Nader Jr., said his 
father "will be ecstatic when he hears the news." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," the younger Nader said. "Now we'll be associated with the 
cities toward the beach."

49ERS LOST NCAA BID BUT FOUND SOMETHING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been a stunning weekend for the Cal State Long Beach men's basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 After beating New Mexico State, 90-85, in the semifinals of the Big West 
Conference tournament, the 49ers were confident they would be selected for the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But at halftime of the Sunday title game with Nevada Las Vegas, the team was 
told that it could get into the tourney only by defeating the third-ranked 
Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers grimly took the Long Beach Arena court, played fanatically for a few 
minutes, then got swept away, 92-74. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot believe it. . . I cannot believe it," Coach Joe Harrington kept 
saying afterward. In the locker room, senior guard Tyrone Mitchell said, "I 
want to keep my respect and dignity, so I have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
It was 24 hours later, and the subdued 49ers gathered for their team banquet at 
the Ramada Renaissance Hotel. Reality had sunk in: They were going not to 
Knoxville, Tenn., to play Houston, but to Tempe, Ariz., to play Friday night 
against Arizona State in the considerably less prestigious National 
Invitational Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very, very proud of you," Cal State Long Beach President Curtis McCray 
told the players. "It's often said that it's only a game, that real life is 
something else. Well, they're wrong. The game is life. When you play a game, 
you're playing life. It is our life. The kind of pain we have undergone in the 
last several hours is part of the pain of life." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington received a standing ovation as he took the podium. His anger had 
subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"The last 24 hours have probably done more for Long Beach State than the last 
10 or 15 years have," he told a crowd of more than 700. "Dick Vitale (the 
loquacious TV commentator) is all over ESPN talking about it. I've gotten calls 
from all over the country about the raw deal we got. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a raw deal, but it won't be the last raw deal you get in your 
life. It's part of life. The reason we were 22-8 was because we could handle 
adversity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a blessing in disguise. Two years ago we were delighted to be in the NIT. 
Today we're disappointed to be in it. My second year at Maryland, when I was an 
assistant coach, we won the NIT. That did so much for Maryland basketball. That 
was a springboard. From then on we were awesome in basketball. Our players will 
use this opportunity to show we're a special group. Long Beach State is not an 
unknown anymore. Yesterday changed all that." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington talked about his players, each of whom received a photo of himself 
in action. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyrone Mitchell," he began. "When we got the news last night, the first thing 
that came in my head was that Tyrone's going back to Arizona State and show 
them a few things. His determination is incredible, you can see it in his 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who had transferred to Long Beach from Arizona State after becoming 
disillusioned because of lack of playing time, has been the team leader this 
season, averaging 10 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't let us lose," assistant coach Seth Greenberg had said after the 
New Mexico State game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, a criminal justice major who plans on going to law school, has also 
stood out academically. 
</P>
<P>
"In his five terms, he was on the president's list or dean's list in four of 
them," said Suzanne Wurzer, director of the office of academic services. "He 
has never received a grade other than A's and Bs." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, wearing a gray suit with a polka-dotted tie, kissed Wurzer on the 
cheek as she presented him with a Big West academic excellence plaque. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Bob Braswell presented the outstanding offensive player award 
to freshman guard Lucious Harris, whom he had coached when both were at 
Cleveland High School in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Harris had scored 75 points in the three Big West tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at him sometimes as a son, and sometimes as a brother," Braswell said. 
"He's very dear to me." 
</P>
<P>
After Mitchell and Troy Joseph were honored as defensive co-players of the 
year, senior Rudy Harvey accepted the sixth-man award. Harvey, though, had 
become a starter late in the season, after which the 49ers went on a nine-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just kind of down," Harvey said. "It hurt yesterday, but we're just going 
to New York now." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, as if thinking of that blur that each season becomes: all the 
practices, all the planes, all the vans and buses, all the hotels, all the 
arenas. 
</P>
<P>
"The years went by so fast," Harvey said. "It seems like it's still my freshman 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Greenberg was called to the microphone. "When we were 13-7, the 
bandwagon got a little small," Greenberg said. "The NCAA can have their (Final 
Four) tournament in Denver. I guarantee this team is going to have its 
tournament in New York. 
</P>
<P>
If the 49ers win three games in the NIT, they will go to Madison Square Garden 
for the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
More awards were presented -- one to Kevin Cutler as the top rebounder, another 
to Frankie Edwards as the best free-throw shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Faulkner, a senior, received the "49er pride" award and said, "We're in 
a unique situation. The whole country believes we deserve to be there. Now 
we're in the NIT. The NCAA is looking at us to see how good we're going to do 
in the NIT. If we lose the first game, the headline will be, 'We didn't deserve 
it anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
The crowd murmured agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Rudy Harvey and I talked about getting up here for the last time," Faulkner 
said. "I'm going to try not to let the tears out. To you young guys, you've all 
got a great future. Try to keep your heads up. And be young. I'll never forget 
the memories or the friendships. I love you guys and I thank you." 
</P>
<P>
As Faulkner returned to his seat, Harrington said, "It's moments like this when 
you understand why you stick with coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington announced that Mitchell had been selected as the team's most 
valuable player. There was another standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to ask that this be given back to the coach, and that the whole team 
be put on it," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Then it became apparent that Mitchell had a lot more to say. He looked over the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"President McCray, my girlfriend and I were having lunch in the Chart Room and 
you came up and spoke to me. That was the classiest thing I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
He turned to Harrington and said, "You have to be the craziest person I've ever 
known." 
</P>
<P>
Laughter filled the room. 
</P>
<P>
Images quickly returned, of Harrington screaming at referees or at Mitchell 
during the heat of practice or a game. 
</P>
<P>
Still looking at his coach, Mitchell said: "He's always given me the confidence 
to go out and lead this team. He's an unbelievable person, a great motivator." 
</P>
<P>
"K.C.," Mitchell said to Cutler, "I love you, man, I really do." 
</P>
<P>
He scanned the room and spotted two of the younger players. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronnie Winbush and Frankie Edwards . . . it took me five years to get where I 
am now, wherever that is. You guys are just babies." 
</P>
<P>
His next subject was the 49ers' laid-back sophomore center. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Masucci, let me apologize for taking a punch at you during practice," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
To the laughing crowd, he explained, "Mike wasn't playing defense so we 
exchanged some words." 
</P>
<P>
When the room became quiet again, Mitchell said kindly but firmly to Masucci: 
"Stop hiding behind that shield of ignorance. You have a lot of potential, only 
you can hold you back." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell turned to Bobby Sears, who may replace him as point guard next season, 
and said, "You will have all the burden I have had, the many sleepless nights, 
the (coaches') yelling and screaming. It is all yours. If you play the way you 
played me in practice, you will have no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell asked his parents, William and Ruth Mitchell, to stand. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left for Arizona State, I thought I was Mr. Independent and didn't need 
anyone to help me," Mitchell said. "How quickly that was erased. They were the 
first to come out and get me when things went bad. They are great people." 
</P>
<P>
Concluding, he said to the players who will return: "Take this snub by the NCAA 
and turn it into something positive. Go out and win 25 or 26 games to assure 
that you'll have a place at the dance." 
</P>
<P>
When all the awards had been presented, Faulkner sat at a piano in a corner of 
the room and in his rich Southern voice sang . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see it's all come to an end, 
</P>
<P>
 Another phase of life is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The future awaits us with its arms open wide, 
</P>
<P>
 I know we will succeed because of our pride. 
</P>
<P>
 We've been through too much together 
</P>
<P>
 to just say goodby and let it go. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendships we've made will last forever, 
</P>
<P>
 'cause they are instilled deep within our souls. 
</P>
<P>
 And I know even if we physically depart, 
</P>
<P>
 we will be here in your hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 And I know we will continue to keep in touch, 
</P>
<P>
 because our friendships they mean so much to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking back on many of our ups and downs, 
</P>
<P>
 all of our wins and loses and our smiles and frowns. 
</P>
<P>
 We've shared joys and pains, we've shared laughter and tears, 
</P>
<P>
 memories we have will last for all years." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a song he had written last week. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Faulkner bent down and hugged 49er fan Pearl Moore, who sat 
in a wheelchair, watching through tears. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to the crowd he had just deeply touched, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"I love all of you. Let's win the NIT, baby."

FANS, YEARBOOK ATTEST TO ARTESIA HIGH'S BASKETBALL PRIDE; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYOFFS: EMERGING POWERHOUSE PREPARES TO PLAY FREMONT OF SUNNYVALE FOR THE 
DIVISION II STATE TITLE IN OAKLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artesia High School, serious about its basketball program, printed a team 
yearbook this season and titled it "On the Rise." 
</P>
<P>
The California Interscholastic Federation champion Pioneers have fulfilled that 
prophesy. They are 28-2 and will play Fremont of Sunnyvale (29-3) for the 
Division II state title at 3 p.m. Saturday in the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The Artesia yearbook includes profiles of Coach Wayne Merino, five assistant 
coaches and Phil Sandoval, the basketball information director. 
</P>
<P>
An introduction gushes with praise for Merino, and included in the book are 
profiles of the varsity players. A page is devoted to All-American Ed O'Bannon 
("ED OHHHHHHHH BAN-NON!" as Sandoval, also the public address announcer, 
enthuses). O'Bannon, perhaps the most intensely recruited prep player in the 
nation, will very likely choose a college from among UCLA, USC, Arizona State, 
Nevada Las Vegas, Syracuse and LSU. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the yearbook are rosters and team photos of the junior varsity and 
freshmen teams, powerhouses themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The ads in the book -- for construction companies, dentists, a chiropractor, a 
restaurant and a video store -- were sold by the players and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said money has been raised from snack-bar sales at games, drawings and 
faculty basketball games with the Los Angeles Rams. The Artesia players also 
work as parking attendants at UCLA football games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Merino sat in his office this week and talked about enthusiasm in the school 
and community for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"Three buses are going up," he said. "They'll take our stats people, the 
cheerleaders, boosters and band. The team is going to fly up." 
</P>
<P>
That will cost about $3,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers are no strangers to jet travel. In December they went to New 
Jersey for a tournament. They saw New York City and also took a train to 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"Times have changed, that's almost commonplace now," Merino said, thinking back 
to the days when high school teams rarely traveled out of state. "The trips 
give the kids pride in their school." 
</P>
<P>
One college coach good-naturedly refers to the 5-foot-5 Merino as a Napoleon. 
And it appears that Merino is building a basketball empire. The JV team was 
18-8 this season, the freshman team was 24-2. 
</P>
<P>
He talks in the yearbook of "developing the student-athlete," "cultivating 
one-and-one relationships" and trying to make the program "a better product all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
"We try to run it like a Mater Dei or Poly," he said, referring to the 
well-known basketball powers in Santa Ana and Long Beach. "We're trying to do 
as classy a job as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Merino, 29, seems almost like a college coach in his highly organized approach, 
but he said he has no immediate ambition to become one. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what I'm doing," he said. "It's exciting to see the kids develop and 
mature over four years. It's exciting knowing that some of them will go on and 
use basketball to get an education, and it's exciting to see kids do well on 
the court and become good people who are polite and well-mannered. That's more 
important to me than winning games." 
</P>
<P>
There are coaches who are critical of Merino's methods. Some have suggested 
that he recruits players, which he denies. No allegation has been 
substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always easy for people to like you when you're losing," Merino said. "Any 
time you have success you're going to have jealousy and resentment," Merino 
said. "That goes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
"If the administration likes what we're doing and the kids like what we're 
doing, that's what's important. We're just regular guys working hard, doing a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
As a student at Mater Dei, Merino played in the band (clarinet), not on the 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
He started coaching when he worked for the recreation department in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It took off from there," said Merino, who at the time was a student at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
He coached church teams, intramural teams, traveling teams, summer all-star 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I was a varsity coach, I coached 150 games a year and I loved it," said 
Merino, who teaches math. "I loved interacting with the kids. I enjoyed seeing 
good things happen to them, seeing them get to travel, seeing basketball keep 
them off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Merino was an assistant coach for two years at Fountain Valley High and three 
years at Mira Costa in Manhattan Beach before coming to Artesia in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought when I hired him he'd be one of the fine young coaches in the area," 
said Jim Nielsen, former Mira Costa coach who is now coach at North Torrance 
High. "He's one of those basketball junkies. He worked his tail off." 
</P>
<P>
Merino and O'Bannon, who transferred from Verbum Dei High in Los Angeles, 
arrived at Artesia at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"They sure changed things around quick," said La Mirada Coach Roger Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers have won three consecutive Suburban League titles. In 1987-88, 
when O'Bannon was a sophomore, they were 17-11 and reached the second round of 
the playoffs. Last season they were 22-7, losing to Dominguez in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia has vaulted into national recognition since Merino and O'Bannon came, 
but the Pioneers were not pushovers before that. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gordon Ackerman, who had been the coach for 28 years, the Pioneers were 
502-244. In his last season, 1986-87, with Tony Farmer (now at the University 
of Nebraska), the Pioneers won the Suburban League title. In the early 1980s 
they had Tom Tolbert, who now plays for the Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
What is evident about Merino's players, other than their talent, is their 
humility. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids have no animosity when they play them," said La Mirada's Williams. 
"The kids he has are really classy. That may be a reflection on Ed. Their heads 
could be sticking out of the gym. You'd assume they'd have big egos, but it's 
nothing that's noticeable." 
</P>
<P>
Said Merino, "We have good kids with good family backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
Ed O'Bannon averages 25 points and 10 rebounds a game, but the 6-9 senior 
forward/center is not the whole show. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Chris Thompson averages 10 points and five assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard DeAndre Austin averages 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Young players play prominent roles: Charles O'Bannon, Ed's brother, averages 10 
points and 5 rebounds. Jae Park, a 6-7 sophomore, is a dependable rebounder. 
And 6-10 freshman Avondre Jones gets about four blocked shots a game. 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Bannon, Jones and Park are veterans of summer league play. "They have 
a world of experience for their age, (but it's still) amazing they're as good 
as they are," Merino said. 
</P>
<P>
Merino said that although Ed O'Bannon gets most of the attention, the other 
players don't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way anyone can be jealous of him," Merino said. "Ed is such a good 
person, very quiet and humble. The kids love him." 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Bannon agreed: "I don't think they're jealous of him. They're happy 
for him. And when college coaches come around to see Ed, they get to see them 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Charles, 15, who in the last year has grown four inches to 6 feet 5, patterns 
himself after his brother, although he is more outgoing off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to make the same moves he does," Charles said. "I idolize the way he 
plays basketball. And he's helped me be a better student and to respect my 
elders." 
</P>
<P>
The O'Bannons are like all the other Pioneers, Merino said, a "pleasure to be 
around." 
</P>
<P>
There was a knock on the door, and the players filed in to join their coach for 
a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
As they did, it was clear that this was not just a team, but a happy family.

10 MATCH-RACE SKIPPERS TO VIE IN L.B. CUP SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten of the world's best match-race skippers are entered in the 26th annual 
Congressional Cup series, which began Wednesday off Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The top contenders figure to be Peter Gilmour of Perth, Australia, the winner 
of the 1988 series, and Chris Dickson of New Zealand, who competed in the 
America's Cup competition in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Each skipper will compete against the other nine skippers in the round-robin 
competition. There will be five races a day. 
</P>
<P>
The skipper with the best round-robin record will qualify for the finals. He 
will face the winner of a semifinal race between the second- and third-place 
finishers in the round-robin competition. 
</P>
<P>
The boats are new and were designed and built especially for the Congressional 
Cup. Manufactured by Catalina Yachts, the boats were donated to the Long Beach 
Yacht Club for the race. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Gilmour and Dickson, the skippers are Russell Coutts of New 
Zealand, Mike Elias of Long Beach, Robbie Haines of Newport Harbor, Peter Isler 
of San Diego, Larry Klein of San Diego, John Kolius of Houston, William Lynn of 
Rye, N.Y., and Makoto Namba of Japan.

FOR THE KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wind is blowing, and there's a nip in the air. A bit too cold for an 
oceanside hike, but the kids still need a place to vent their energy. 
</P>
<P>
The solution? Think roller-skating. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we do that's fun for the kids is called a flea hop to Top 40 
music," said Lisa Camarillo, assistant manager of Skating Plus in Ventura. 
"They skate around and do a jump and a skip, like dance steps. As far as the 
kids are concerned, it's the thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to its Roller Derby image, roller-skating at the rink is not as 
aggressive as some people think it is, rink owners say. They will also tell you 
that on top of being a social sport, skating is good exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great fun for the kids," said R.F. Miller, owner of Roller Gardens in 
Oxnard. "We keep them interested and moving." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays and Sundays from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Miller said, kids at the Roller 
Gardens get a chance to play games such as the hokeypokey on wheels andto try 
their luck rolling under the limbo stick. 
</P>
<P>
Skating Plus finds a new approach to holding kids' interest. "We do a 
bucket-of-money drop," Camarillo said. "We put money around on the floor, blow 
a whistle and then they have a certain amount of time to collect it." Parents 
are not encouraged to participate. 
</P>
<P>
So what if your child -- or you, for that matter -- has never been on skates 
before? Not to fear. Lessons are available. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo, whose daughter began taking lessons at age 2, said roller-skating 
isn't difficult to learn, but the rate of mastery varies from person to person. 
</P>
<P>
"A 5-year-old could learn well in two weeks, or a 10-year-old in six weeks. It 
isn't so much a matter of age," she said, "as much as it is coordination." 
</P>
<P>
Roller-skating isn't expensive -- the price of admission ranges from $2.75 to 
$3.75 without skate rental. But one thing to keep in mind is that, if your 
child likes it, there could be trouble down the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we qualified seven children for the national championships," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the kids get the bug and are competitive," he added, "just their skates 
cost $500." 
</P>
<P>
 Where to go: Skating Plus, 1728 Mesa Verde Ave. in Ventura, 656-2120; Skate 
Palace, 451 W. Hueneme Road in Oxnard, 488-6444; Roller Gardens, 2731 Buckaroo 
Ave. in Oxnard, 642-5380.

OUT AND ABOUT: FOLK DANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 12 members of Tchaika, a folk dance group, sounded like a swarm of angry 
bees as performed a dance called the floricica olteanesca on a recent evening 
at the Loma Vista School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The group whipped through the Romanian line dance, hopping, stomping and 
executing quick little scissor kicks to the buzzing of a jew's harp. 
</P>
<P>
"We're celebrating," said Edith Sewell, the amateur folk dancing group's perky, 
fiftysomething instructor. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of recent reforms in Eastern Europe, Tchaika -- it means sea 
gull in Russian -- is focusing on the dances of Romania, Bulgaria and 
Yugoslavia through April. 
</P>
<P>
The group hopes that those caught up in the political excitement will be 
attracted to the two-hour sessions on Thursday evenings at Loma Vista School in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell so much about a people by the way they dance," Sewell said. These 
dances "have so much energy and so much sadness." 
</P>
<P>
The sessions are open to the public with a $2 admission. They begin with a half 
hour or so of instruction by Sewell. Performances from the group's repertoire, 
which includes more than 100 dances, take up the rest of the evening, with 
either Sewell or seasoned folk dancers leading line dances. 
</P>
<P>
During such spirited numbers such as the floricica olteanesca, the group 
splinters into several lines according to ability. Less-advanced participants 
dance behind veterans so they can follow each step. Tchaika is one of five 
Ventura County groups that meet regularly to learn and practice interpretations 
of centuries-old folk dances from Eastern Europe, Israel, Greece, South Africa, 
South America and Canada (see box). 
</P>
<P>
"You can't trace every dance to a specific time and place," said Tchaika 
regular Jackson Wheeler, 37. "But they have authentic elements, and the music 
is authentic." 
</P>
<P>
The instructors of these groups scour folk dancing festivals and clubs for 
recordings. Some take folk dancing tours and cruises to learn new dances and to 
record music. The search for new steps and tunes has taken Sewell, who formerly 
performed modern dance, to Romania, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening, musical accompaniment ranged from the angelic voices of a 
Bulgarian children's choir to the tinny tones of the tamburitza, a relative of 
the balalaika. 
</P>
<P>
Participants ranged in age from early 30s to mid-70s and included a grocery 
store clerk, a civil engineer and a social worker. Some wore embroidered 
peasant blouses and opanci, or leather-soled Macedonian slippers with pointed 
toes; others, sweat pants and high tops. Few brought partners. 
</P>
<P>
While the group occasionally broke into what Sewell called "Romanian aerobics," 
the pace wasn't always breakneck. At the evening's close, dancers threaded 
through lesnoto, a Macedonian line dance so lazy, Sewell said, that "you can 
gossip." 
</P>
<P>
Olga Voltava, a 75-year-old immigrant from Poland, couldn't have been more at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"Our parents taught us to do these sort of dances," she said. "Long before this 
was recreation, it was part of our ethnic lore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE TO PRACTICE 
</P>
<P>
There are enough folk-dancing groups in Ventura County that an enthusiast can 
polish his Floricica Olteanesca or Lesnoto practically every night of the week. 
Here's a list of the classes, which are open to the public for a small fee: 
</P>
<P>
* SUNDAY -- Haverim, a Ventura group specializing in Israeli folk dancing, 
meets at 7 p.m. at the Temple Beth Torah at 7620 Foothill Road. Cost is $1 for 
members, $2 for non-members. Contact: Barbara Rosenberg, 643-0897. 
</P>
<P>
* MONDAY -- The Conejo Valley Folk Dancers, a Thousand Oaks group of about 30 
people, meets at 7 p.m. at Conejo School, 280 Conejo School Road, for a wide 
range of international fare, including French-Canadian dances. The cost is $1 
for members, $2 for non-members. Contact: Eugene Lovejoy, 498-2491. 
</P>
<P>
* WEDNESDAY -- The Ojai Valley Folk Dancers, a group of about 10 people, meets 
at 8 p.m. at the Ojai Center for the Arts, 113 S. Montgomery St., for a wide 
range of international folk dances. Contact: Sarah Harkins-Beard, 646-2195. 
</P>
<P>
* THURSDAY -- Tchaika Folk Dance Club, which attracts about a dozen people for 
Balkan dancing, meets at 8 p.m. at the Loma Vista School at 300 Lynn Dr. in 
Ventura. Cost is $2. Contact: Edith Sewell, 985-7316. 
</P>

NIGHT LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN RAGING ARB PLAYS, THE BAR MAKES MORE IN A NIGHT THAN IN A WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They may be 30 minutes late for their 9:30 gig on Saturday night, but when 
local rock legends Raging Arb &amp; The Redheads kick off their set with a 
scorching cover of "I'm a Man," the tiny dance floor at Charlie's Seaside Cafe 
in Ventura will be transformed into a sweatbox of relentless dancers. And 
forget about the New Sobriety. Raging Arb &amp; The Redheads are, in fact, the 
sound track for beer. Their live shows are the local equivalent of a Grateful 
Dead concert, except psychedelic drugs and dancing are replaced by drinking and 
dancing. And drinking. Usually, when the band plays, the bar makes more in one 
night than it does all week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a straight-ahead rock 'n' roll band with a little beer on top," 
says lead singer John Drury. "When we play, it's more than a job. It's an 
adventure. As the crowd celebrates, so do we. It's taxing on everyone." 
</P>
<P>
"Usually we have one doorman," notes Drew Setterfield, bartender at Charlie's 
and survivor of many an Arb show, "but when Raging Arb plays, we have five 
bouncers and no waitresses. It's so crowded they couldn't move anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The band, mostly surfers and all Ventura High locals, has been playing together 
since 1983 and consistently draws large, raucous crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"Our crowd is made up of die-hard Redhead fans," Drury says. "When we play, 
it's like a little pressure cooker. Sometimes, it just boils over." 
</P>
<P>
Not only will the band never play at a Mothers Against Drunk Driving function, 
but they don't play much at all -- maybe once a month. Maybe that's all anyone 
can stand. Raging Arb has played every area venue at least once, sometimes only 
once: They've been 86ed from everywhere. In fact, two years ago the Easter gig 
at Charlie's ended with the Ventura Police Department pulling the plug after 
some parking-lot fights. The band was banned from Charlie's for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Raging Arb made it to the finals of the Battle of the Bands in 
Santa Barbara. Not surprisingly, a Santa Barbara band, Five Cool What, won. 
That was the last time the Arbs played Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Only half the busload made it back to Ventura. The other half were in jail," 
recalled Drury. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the local rock bad boys are mellowing. After all, a few of the band 
members got married last year, and at last month's gig at Charlie's, the police 
only came once. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the band's reputation, the fact remains that Raging Arb &amp; The 
Redheads are a blazing hot rock 'n' roll band, specializing in electric, nasty 
blues -- sort of like the Rolling Stones from 1966 or so. In fact the band does 
a few everybody's-gotta-dance tunes the Stones made popular -- "Around and 
Around" and "Not Fade Away" -- when, as often happens, they are joined by their 
musical mentor, guitarist Chris Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
"Our influence? Let's see," says drummer Ross Emery, "there's the Stones, 
Aerosmith, the Blasters, the T-Birds when they were good, Charlie Pickett and 
Top Jimmy." 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1985, the band released an eight-song album of original material. It's 
pretty hard to find these days but worth looking for. Intense bluesy rockers in 
the Georgia Satellites' style that your feet will love right away include 
"Johnny Ray," "Did You Get Your Fill?" and "Strut." The band has a repertoire 
of about 45 songs, about half originals, and is working on a demo tape. 
</P>
<P>
The band features Drury on vocals, Emery on drums, Billy McGraw on lead guitar, 
Guy Martin on second guitar, John House on bass and Glen Ansberry bad to the 
bone on harmonica. Martin is a fill-in for Toby Emery, who's surfing his way 
around the world for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie's is next to the Ventura Holiday Inn on the Promenade. Be early or be 
left outside.

PHOTOGRAPHER MAKES SEED PACKAGES, CATALOGS BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commercial photographer was walking through a red poppy field that would 
have done any home gardener proud, but he might as well have been negotiating a 
mine field. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Dibblee, a 38-year-old Ventura native who specializes in seed packages, 
side-stepped a hot pink blossom. "An off-type," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
He skirted a patch littered with the evidence of wind damage and watched for 
the lacy pattern that spells an infestation by the dreaded Diabrotica beetle. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, here's a pretty one," he said, fingering what seemed to be a perfect 
blossom. "Except you've got some little holes . . . " 
</P>
<P>
And so it went until Dibblee, a tall, willowy man with a graying beard, spotted 
the flawless bunch of flowers that may or may not appear on the next package of 
Scarlet Bubble Icelandic Poppies produced by the W. Atlee Burpee Co. 
</P>
<P>
Dibblee shoots nearly half of the hundreds of seed package covers produced 
annually by Burpee. He is one of only two photographers used by the company and 
the only one on the West Coast. His photographs of flowers, ground covering, 
fruits and vegetables have also appeared in a wide range of farm publications, 
such as Seed World, Grower Talks and The California-Arizona Farm Press, as well 
as such mainstream magazines as Good Housekeeping, Harrowsmith and Sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Considering his workload and the whims of nature, Dibble's grateful, he said, 
that he has considerable patience. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, you're at the mercy of nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures of the poppies, for instance, took three passes through the field. 
One day, the flowers were "waving just a little too much" in the wind at 
Burpee's test plot off Briggs Road in Santa Paula; another day, it drizzled. 
The wind promised to whoop on the third, then it died down only to pick up 
again. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, the pace is all too quick. 
</P>
<P>
During July, for instance, 40 varieties of flowers and produce will ripen in a 
single week and more if a heat wave follows a cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
During those periods Dibblee, who also shoots package covers and catalog 
pictures for the Peto Seed Co. in Saticoy, rushes from one field to another, 
trying to capture tomatoes, cucumbers, summer squash and peppers before they 
lose their luster. 
</P>
<P>
"If the tomatoes have to be shot, they have to be shot," said Ursula 
Rohmann-Gould, Peto's advertising manager. "It's a matter of hours, not days." 
</P>
<P>
In the summer, it's not unusual for Dibblee to leave home at 5 a.m. -- to beat 
the crews who harvest the crops for seed -- and not return home until after 9 
p.m., said Mariane Dibblee, his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The dedication has paid off. Peto Seed Co., which sells seeds to farmers, has 
tried other photographers but has been disappointed, Rohmann-Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
"The broccoli looked purple," she said. Now she uses Dibble exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fantastic," concurred Barbara Wolverton, Burpee's photography supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for someone who says he received a "D" in photography in high school 
and took only one course on the subject in college. 
</P>
<P>
Dibblee traces his success to his father, Walt, who ran a commercial 
photography studio in Ventura for 35 years before retiring in 1982. Ralph 
Nadar, meanwhile, gets credit for instilling in Dibblee the persistence needed 
to track down just the right subject. As a photographer for the Oxnard 
Press-Courier in the early 1970s, Dibblee covered a press conference held by 
the consumer rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Nadar chastised him for shooting "practically every other move he made." 
</P>
<P>
"I was the example of the waste in our society," Dibble said. "Not wasting film 
has been in the back of my mind ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Dibble joined his father's business in 1976 after leaving the newspaper and a 
discouraging round of lumbering jobs in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
He's specialized in agricultural photography for 10 years, but his routine 
makes growing plants from seeds seem simple. 
</P>
<P>
Take picking the proper specimen. A cucumber has to have the correct 
length-to-width ratio for its variety. 
</P>
<P>
A pear tomato can't look round, and the stem of a special "jointed" variety has 
to be intact so it looks as easy to pick as it is. 
</P>
<P>
If the soil beneath a plant is going to be visible, Dibblee rakes it, breaks up 
the dirt clots and generally "fluffs it up." 
</P>
<P>
If the vegetable is at all dirty, it gets a bath. 
</P>
<P>
Dibblee might spray it with water, but not very much. He said he doesn't want 
to remind farmers of "the fungus infestations that they fight every day." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything," he said, "has to be prepared to look as natural as possible." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the poppies, that meant cutting a bud looming behind the bunch 
of three that made up the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"It made it look like the blossom on the left had two stems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He lowered his camera and tripod within a foot of the ground to get "a shot 
with the sky. No dirt," he emphasized, resting his elbow in the earth as he 
crouched before the viewfinder. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohhh," he groaned when a bee landed on a stamen. "No bees! Not for a seed 
package!" 
</P>
<P>
Dibblee shot 14 shots with the three blossoms rustling slightly in a breeze 
like Fortuny petticoats, and called it a wrap -- at least for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"It might seem like a waste, but with this flower I'll probably make another 
attempt." 
</P>

THOUSAND OAKS TREE OFFICER PUTS BARK BEFORE BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI LYNN WIGLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While taking a drive through his territory, William Elmendorf, the first urban 
forester for the city of Thousand Oaks, declared, "I'm a conservationist, not a 
tree cop." 
</P>
<P>
This would have been a strange remark if not for the fact that he was in one of 
the few cities where you might actually find a tree cop. Thousand Oaks isn't 
just named after trees, it takes them very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Elmendorf joined the city in 1987 as an oak code enforcement officer and still 
administers the 46-page ordinance. But, for the past two years, he has had the 
wider duty of managing the community's tree resources. 
</P>
<P>
The only urban forester in Ventura County, Elmendorf explained his emerging 
profession's two essential tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"We overcome the stresses that attack urban trees and restore vigor to the 
forest by planting the right tree in the right place and giving it proper 
care," he said. "We encourage community education and the participation of 
residents, local businesses, institutions and organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Elmendorf works for the Planning Department and considers the 1989, five-volume 
city of Thousand Oaks Forestry Master Plan his Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a progressive attitude about trees in Thousand Oaks," he said. "It all 
starts with the City Council, which supports me, as do the city manager and the 
Public Works Department. Our mission is to maximize the tangible and intangible 
things our trees offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Trees are emotional as well as political in the urban environment. People fall 
in love with trees, and the goodwill created by trees is hard to measure." 
</P>
<P>
He figures that a city tree's value is 25 times that of one destined to frame 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
It contributes to the town's aesthetics, character, identity, civic pride, 
property values, animal habitats, oxygen production, reduction of air pollution 
and erosion prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Elmendorf, 33, said his passion for trees was triggered by the environmental 
awareness sweeping the country in the 1970s. He first spent seven years in what 
he terms classical forestry: timber-cutting, recreation, hydrology, range 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Elmendorf drove a 10-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway that cuts through the 
entire city (and its 220,000-tree forest). There are about two trees for every 
resident, he said, though the first street-by-street census of trees will be 
taken this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the urban forest, which people zip through at 55 m.p.h., off-ramps lead to 
5,000 native oaks -- valley, coast live and scrub. Other original species are 
California sycamores, willows, bay laurel, big leaf maples and black walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
The community forest is an appreciating asset with proper management, Elmendorf 
said. The trees' economic value is calculated by species, location and 
condition. The city's 28,000 street trees are worth more than $47 million; a 
prize oak, $50,000; most large oaks, $20,000 to $70,000 each; a eucalyptus, 
$2,000 to $8,000 and an ordinary tree, $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the city's biggest oaks, 80 feet high with 68-inch diameters and 
200-foot spreads, are on private property. 
</P>
<P>
As a free city service, Elmendorf makes house calls to diagnose homeowners' 
tree problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty percent of the time they are watering too much," he said. "When I tell 
them how much money they could save on water bills, they're happy, and so are 
their trees." 
</P>
<P>
In the city's North Ranch area, Elmendorf made three stops. At a residential 
construction site he showed how the city and the developer had worked together 
to preserve 67 of the 68 oaks, the youngest of which were seedlings during the 
American Revolution. Some were twice that age. 
</P>
<P>
At a park Elmendorf explained that oaks are surrounded by 15 feet of wood chips 
instead of grass, to protect them from irrigation. "Water is death on oaks," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That tree is 200 years old and never been irrigated." 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of a residential area was an oak savannah, with grasses, 
sagebrush, a habitat for coyotes, birds and other small animals. 
</P>
<P>
The land is part of the Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency's 6,000 acres of 
permanently protected public open space. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council has been preserving pieces of savannah for 20 years," he 
said. "It will never be developed, will always be the way it is today."

Locals have known about it for years. It's a place where you can buy seashells, 
fly a kite, eat fish and enjoy a view of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
But judging from the small crowd on a recent sunny weekend, not many people 
have discovered the wharf on Oxnard's Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Overlooking the harbor at Victoria Avenue and Channel Islands Boulevard is a 
small, picturesque group of shops and restaurants that make up Fisherman's 
Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
Gift shops with their wooden signs, T-shirts and jewelry cater to tourists and 
to anyone who wants an outing that includes shopping. But people looking for 
peace and quiet can find that too among the well-kept greenery and wooden 
decks. 
</P>
<P>
Souvenir-seekers can buy a shark's tooth for 35 cents or a white cockle 
seashell for 12 cents at Shell World. The gift shop features lamps, plant 
holders and jewelry made from shells, but you won't find anything that is 
locally picked. This stock comes from locales such as the Philippines and the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Those looking for local seafood can buy live crabs and lobsters from a tank at 
Brandon King Seafood Inc., where tongs are offered, but adventurous types are 
welcome to seize the creatures barehanded. A sign by the tank cautions, "Live 
crabs, watch your fingers." 
</P>
<P>
The live crabs cost $2.09 a pound. Cooked, they cost $2.99 a pound. In addition 
to crabs and lobsters, Brandon King sells shrimp, fish and oysters, which it 
buys freshly caught. Brandon King and the Captain's Gallery both feature 
fast-food menus that include seafood, hamburgers and ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
For the more upscale diner, Reuben's Restaurant provides steak and seafood, 
plus a dining room overlooking the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The wharf offers an ocean breeze that is ideal for kite-fliers, who will want 
to take advantage of the wooden pier to do their flying. Runners can detour 
onto the pier, which is connected to a path parallel to the harbor that is 
ideal for a long-distance run or a short jog. Cyclists may have a harder time 
of it on the pier and should walk their bikes to avoid running down fellow 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The less movement-oriented can confine their activity to the pier area and not 
miss a thing. Children can climb on the two cannons on the wooden deck, and 
couples can stroll hand-in-hand down the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a good book and a cup of coffee, a person can spend the afternoon 
lounging on a deck and watching the world go by. Stop a while. The tourists 
shouldn't have all the fun.

Three armed men burst into a Van Nuys bar Wednesday night, robbed 20 patrons 
and employees and held them hostage for an hour before police arrived, 
authorities said today. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were booked on suspicion of robbery and kidnaping and were being 
held at Van Nuys Jail. They were identified as Otis Tooks, 31, and Arthur 
Taylor, 24, both of Compton, and Albert G. Sutton, 24, of San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Rick Shields said three men entered the Nice 'N' Easy bar at 7214 
Sepulveda Blvd. about 7:30 p.m., herded patrons and employees into a back 
office at gunpoint and took their cash and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
One patron was able to slip out and call police. Officers surrounded the bar as 
a police helicopter circled above and, using a loudspeaker, ordered the robbers 
to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
"Two attempted to escape through an air vent but were stopped on the roof by 
officers in the helicopter," Shields said. The third gunman surrendered about 
10 minutes later.

KNESSET VOTES LACK OF CONFIDENCE, BRINGS DOWN SHAMIR GOVERNMENT

Parliament approved a vote of no-confidence today, bringing down the government 
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
In a roll call, 60 Knesset members voted for the no-confidence motion 
introduced by the Labor Party and 55 voted against the motion. Five 
parliamentarians were absent during the voting. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in Israel's nearly 42-year history that a government had 
been ousted by a vote of no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the outcome of the vote, Shamir smiled when greeted by members of his 
Likud Party. "Well, those are the results. They were no surprise after what has 
happened over the past several hours," Shamir told Israel Radio. "Life goes on 
even after disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, accused by Labor of being a stumbling block to the Middle East peace 
process, now heads a caretaker government. President Chaim Herzog must select 
which political party he believes has the best chance of forming a government 
-- Labor or Likud. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always said that there is a majority in the Knesset for the advancement 
in the peace process and that was proved tonight," Labor Party leader Shimon 
Peres said after the vote of no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Labor Party official Yitzhak Rabin sounded a conciliatory note, saying 
he would not be disappointed if another Likud-Labor coalition government were 
formed. But he added: "The government fell for one reason. The Likud was unable 
to say yes and move forward" with the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Just one hour before the vote, Shamir and the Labor Party leaders tried to 
reach a compromise to restore the 15-month-old Likud-Labor coalition that 
collapsed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But no agreement was reached despite last-minute prodding from Ovadia Yosef, 
spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, the largest religious party 
faction in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed compromise would have provided that Jerusalem was not negotiable 
and that it would remain united under Israel's rule. It proposed that Shamir 
return ousted Labor leaders to the ruling coalition and that he agree to a 
proposal by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III to start 
Israeli-Palestinian talks. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir fired Peres on Tuesday, triggering the collapse of the 15-month-old 
coalition. After Peres' dismissal, all 10 other Labor ministers resigned from 
the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Shamir refused to give a guarantee of a positive answer to Baker," Peres 
said after meeting with Yosef. "There is no other choice but to go to the 
Knesset and decide." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, hecklers berated Shamir as he stood at the front of the Knesset 
chamber to defend himself against the no-confidence motions. "You will not 
quiet me," Shamir shouted at the hecklers. "Let me finish talking." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The enemies are still at the gate. They are far from achieving their 
goals. The land is still being built, and the way is still long to the 
settlement of all parts of her." 
</P>
<P>
But in introducing the first no-confidence motion against Shamir, Peres said, 
"Shamir has one problem, he represents an old fear -- fear to move forward 
toward peace, fear to make peace with Egypt, fear to make peace with Jordan, 
fear to open a dialogue with the Palestinians."

State Board of Equalization member Paul Carpenter was indicted by a federal 
grand jury today on charges stemming from the FBI's three-year sting 
investigation of Capitol corruption. 
</P>
<P>
He was charged with a total of four counts of racketeering and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment followed by six weeks the conviction of state Sen. Joseph 
Montoya, who was the first elected state official charged as a result of the 
elaborate undercover investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, 62, a Democrat from Cypress, was a state senator seeking election to 
the tax-setting Board of Equalization in 1986 when he accepted two campaign 
contributions totaling $20,000 from Gulf Shrimp Fisheries, a sham company 
created by the FBI as part of its sting. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter accepted his initial contribution from the FBI, a check for $15,000, 
through John Shahabian, a legislative aide who later became an FBI informant.

The Soviet Parliament ruled today that Lithuania's declaration of independence 
was invalid and said Soviet law is still in force in the Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution, proposed by the parliamentary leadership, was passed by a vote of 
1,463 to 94. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed by the Congress of People's Deputies, the expanded 
Parliament, also turned over to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
responsibility for "ensuring the lawful rights of every person" in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The republic's Parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 
Sunday. Gorbachev has said the move was invalid but no action has been taken to 
enforce Soviet law on the territory of the republic. 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress states that according to Article 74 and 75 of the U.S.S.R. 
Constitution, the decision of Lithuania's Sejm (Parliament) is invalid," the 
Congress' resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
Those articles say Soviet law has the same force in all Soviet republics, that 
all-union law prevails over republican law, and defines the Soviet Union as the 
composite of the 15 republics. 
</P>
<P>
"Confirming the right of every republic to secede, the Congress rules that 
until the law determining the order of secession is adopted, the decisions 
taken by Lithuania's Sejm on March 10-12 are invalid," the resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier there had been fierce debate over the resolution, which was introduced 
by Rafik Nishanov, the chairman of the Council of Nationalities, one of the two 
chambers of the Supreme Soviet, the standing Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this mean that we are to ignore the will of Lithuania expressed through 
the highest body in the republic?" asked Yuri Boldyrev, a deputy from 
Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any military confrontation against the will of the people," said 
Alexander Lbolensky, a radical deputy from Kalingrad, which is located between 
Lithuania and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has said a government commission, headed by Prime Minister Nikolai 
Ryzhkov, will study the issue and announce public policy. The commission is 
expected to meet with both Lithuanians and Estonians, who are also 
contemplating a breakaway move.

President Bush called on U.S. manufacturers today to take changes in Eastern 
Europe and elsewhere as opportunities to capture new world markets and cash in 
on a "growth dividend." 
</P>
<P>
And the President, apparently concerned that American business is too oriented 
toward short-term profits, urged corporate executives to return to 
old-fashioned values and take a long-term view of business prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a marathon, it isn't a sprint," he told the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Although conceding "our economy is not perfect and I don't want to paint an 
unrealistic picture," Bush said: "We can't produce the products needed to 
capture world markets by focusing on results one quarter at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to return not only to yesterday's values but also yesterday's thinking 
-- the 'long-term thinking' and 'investment-in-the-future' way of doing 
business," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Citing recent improvements in the U.S. trade deficit, Bush told the 
manufacturers that the United States "is once again the world's No. 1 
exporter." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "We must move aggressively to open markets, not just in Japan but 
around the world, and expand our share of global trade." 
</P>
<P>
Noting recent pro-democracy upheavals in Eastern Europe and Central America, 
Bush said the "Revolution of '89 marks the triumph not only of free ideas -- 
but also of free markets. And, when it comes to free markets, America continues 
to lead the way." 
</P>
<P>
Bush referred to the "peace dividend" -- the savings on defense spending from 
the relaxation of East-West tensions -- when he told his audience that U.S. 
industry's resolve will be tested "as the dramatic new changes in the world 
produce new challenges in the world market." 
</P>
<P>
"We must prepare now to meet these challenges. My Administration is committed 
to an agenda for growth. It is founded upon investing in our future -- and 
every sound investment has its yield. America's yield is the growth dividend. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth dividend will provide Americans with jobs and opportunity, higher 
living standards and a legacy of prosperity," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he told a news conference earlier this week that he was not feuding 
with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan over interest-rate policy, 
he said, "We need to keep interest rates down."

BRAZIL INAUGURATES COLLOR DE MELLO; 
</P>
<P>
40-YEAR-OLD PRESIDENT PROMISES REFORMS TO CUT INFLATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Fernando Collor de Mello was inaugurated today for a five-year term as Brazil's 
first popularly elected president in 29 years, and he pledged sweeping reforms 
to end inflation and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people cheered and waved banners proclaiming a new Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
But many people were nervous about economic measures Collor de Mello has said 
he will announce Friday to slash crippling inflation, running at 2,700% yearly. 
</P>
<P>
Banks were closed for three days beginning Tuesday to halt frenzied 
speculation, and police were called to shops that illegally increased prices. 
</P>
<P>
Collor de Mello, at 40 Brazil's youngest president ever, promised to resolve 
the unprecedented economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is enemy No. 1," he said. "My presidency will wager everything on 
victory against this social cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Collor de Mello pledged to combat "corruption and prevarication, paid idlers 
who see the state as a source of personal or family gain." He said Brazil will 
encourage modernization of the largely state-controlled economy and welcome 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil intends to pay its $114-billion foreign debt, he said, but the country's 
growth comes first. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want confrontation," Collor de Mello said. "But the question is how 
much we can pay after we guarantee our economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen heads of state or government attended the ceremony. The United States 
was represented by Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 Brazil returned to civilian government through an electoral college 
vote set up by the departing 21-year military regime and Congress established 
the direct vote. Jose Sarney, who became transitional president in 1985, passed 
the green and yellow presidential sash to Collor de Mello. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations of a brief wage-and-price freeze, massive layoffs of federal 
employees and other drastic measures to cut Brazil's $31-billion budget deficit 
sent tremors across the nation of 150 million. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials ordered shop owners not to raise prices, and police 
visited stores that failed to heed the warning. Some shops raised prices by as 
much as 150%. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilians waited in block-long lines outside automatic bank tellers, where 
daily withdrawals were limited to the equivalent of $47 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Labor unions, representing more than half of Brazil's 60-million work force, 
threatened to call strikes if wages are frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Business activity slowed as rumors of drastic economic measures swirled across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the Central Bank would devalue the new cruzado by 30%, or 
replace the Brazilian currency with another.

Britain recalled its ambassador to Iraq today after the government of President 
Saddam Hussein ignored international appeals and hanged a London-based 
journalist accused of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
Britain also suspended all ministerial visits and military training programs. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to recall London's ambassador to Iraq, Harold Walker, came after 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he was "shocked and repelled" by 
the execution, and he could not remember any other recent case of such 
disregard for united world opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Farzad Bazoft, 31, was sentenced to death on Saturday by a military court that 
accused him of spying for Israel when he entered an unauthorized military 
complex north of Baghdad last September. He was investigating for the Observer 
newspaper an explosion reported to have killed hundreds of people. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said a British nurse, Daphne Parish, 52, who was accused of driving 
Bazoft to the restricted zone, had been shifted to a central jail to begin her 
15-year sentence also passed by the revolutionary tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Kealy, the British consul general who witnessed the execution inside a 
Baghdad prison, told the BBC that Bazoft looked "hollow-eyed and subdued" as he 
was led to the gallows. 
</P>
<P>
"He passed on a written message and a number of oral messages to friends and 
colleagues . . . and he repeated that he had been a journalist going after a 
scoop," Kealy said. 
</P>
<P>
British diplomats said Iraqi Information Minister Latif Nassif Jassim delivered 
the body to the British Embassy and said: "Mrs. Thatcher wanted him alive. We 
are giving you his body. . . . Iraq will not be affected by Britain's anger."

Shining Path guerrillas shot and killed 19 peasants, nearly all of them women 
and children, in a small Andean hamlet where they had fled to escape rebel 
attacks in their own village, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The massacre occurred late Tuesday in Pishupiaco, 60 miles southeast of 
Huancayo, a major trading center in the Andes 120 miles east of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
The police report said the leftist rebels armed with automatic weapons called 
together townspeople in the village square, where they carefully checked each 
person's identity and told 19 people to stand apart from the rest. They then 
opened fire, killing those they had selected. 
</P>
<P>
The victims included 11 children between the ages of 2 and 10, 7 women and a 
26-year-old man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors said the victims were among 180 refugees who came to Pishupiaco from 
Ayacucho to escape guerrilla violence and government repression.

AT&amp;T DRAFTING PLAN FOR EARLY RETIREMENTS

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., continuing a campaign to cut costs, 
said today that it is drafting an early retirement program for some of its 
165,000 non-management workers and is in talks with its two major unions over 
the plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're exploring it right now," said AT&amp;T spokesman Burke Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a fistful of plans right now, but no handshake on any one of them." 
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose how many employees may be affected, and no time frame for a 
plan was given. 
</P>
<P>
Stinson said the interest in such a plan began last year when AT&amp;T offered 
a pension sweetener to managers that was accepted by about 12,500, or about 37% 
of those eligible. 
</P>
<P>
More cuts would have to be approved by AT&amp;T's two biggest unions, the 
Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been using work-force reductions as its main method for cutting 
costs. AT&amp;T has cut staff by more than 90,000 since its 1984 divestiture. 
</P>
<P>
Stinson said the telecommunications giant cut its work force, which is 
currently at 281,400, by about 25,500 jobs last year. 
</P>
<P>
Last December the company said it plans to cut an additional 8,500 jobs this 
year.

India today rejected Coca-Cola Co.'s bid to re-enter its growing market, from 
which the soft-drink maker was effectively ejected in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Arun Nehru announced to Parliament that he has turned down 
Coca-Cola's proposal to set up a plant near New Delhi to make its soft-drink 
concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokeswoman declined to explain the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The government's move leaves PepsiCo, Coca-Cola's main rival, as the only 
foreign soft-drink firm with a presence in the growing Indian market, now worth 
$200 million. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection was the second setback for Coca-Cola in India at the hands of a 
non-Congress Party government. In 1977, when the first non-Congress government 
took power, it asked the company to give up 60% of its fully owned Indian 
subsidiary. The company refused and pulled out of the country. Its bid to 
return centered on a proposal made months before India's second non-Congress 
government since independence took power in December.

Maxwell Communication Corp. said today it had rejected an offer of undisclosed 
size for its 56% stake in Berlitz International Inc., the language services 
company that went public late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The British-based Maxwell called the offer inadequate but declined to say what 
the offer was. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Chairman Robert Maxwell said in a statement that the offer had come 
from K-III Holdings, a partnership led by the former head of the Macmillan Inc. 
publishing company and financed largely by the leveraged buyout specialists 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Charles G. McCurdy, another former Macmillan executive now at K-III Holdings, 
said K-III had no comment on its offer or whether it planned to pursue it 
further. 
</P>
<P>
In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Berlitz was up 37 1/2 cents a 
share at $16.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
At that price, its total of 19 million common shares outstanding are worth 
about $307 million.

DOW CLIMBS 7.88 DESPITE 'WITCHING HOUR' WARINESS

<P>
The stock market settled for some spotty gains today at the close of a quiet 
session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.88 to 2,695.72. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues held a narrow edge on declines at the New York Stock Exchange, 
with 740 up, 668 down and 531 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 144.41 million shares, against 145.06 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained .52 to 186.20. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the financial world's attention was focused on Friday, when the markets 
have a date with the quarterly "triple witching hour" involving a set of 
expiring options and futures on stock indexes. 
</P>
<P>
The witching hour has acquired a reputation for unpredictable turbulence, which 
tends to discourage traders from taking positions before it happens. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda for Friday are several reports from the government on the 
state of the economy, including industrial production and the producer price 
index of finished goods for February. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said investors seemed fairly confident that the data would support 
recent hopes that the economy could recover from its recent slowdown without 
having to undergo a full-scale recession. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices lost ground in slow early trading today in advance of the release 
of three key economic reports by the government on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 1/4 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 
face amount, around midday. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was up to 
8.63% from 8.60% late today. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said 
traders may have sold to take profits after weak auto sales inspired a buying 
spree Wednesday that sent the price of the long bond up a full point. 
</P>
<P>
A drop in the West German bond market also hampered U.S. trading, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said activity was mostly quiet before the scheduled release Friday of 
figures for February producer prices, housing starts and industrial production. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts forecast that the Producer Price Index would decline about 0.4% 
overall, but increase 0.3% to 0.4% excluding the volatile food and energy 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds, and 
Flanagan said the number probably would be viewed as a slight negative because 
of the overall increase. Energy prices have been skittish because of 
unseasonably warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were down 1/16 point to 1/8 point, intermediate maturities were 5/32 point 
lower, and long-term issues traded down 7/32 point to 5/16 point, according to 
Telerate Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, declined 1.41 to 1,147.30. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 8.19% as the discount 
rose 2 basis points to 7.94%. Yields on six-month bills inched up to 8.29% as 
the discount gained 1 basis point to 7.87%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 
8.41% as the discount gained 2 basis points to 7.81%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 1/4% at midday, down from 8 3/16% late Wednesday.

BRYANT GUMBEL FINALLY TELLS ABOUT THAT MEMO 
</P>

<P>
Bryant Gumbel finally has something to say about his famous memo. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a little more than a year since the "Today" show host's blistering 
critique of his fellow workers found its way to the pages of most newspapers 
around the country. But in that year, Gumbel has said nothing publicly about 
its contents, except for a veiled on-air reference. 
</P>
<P>
The long silence is over: On Monday, while taping an interview with ABC's 
Barbara Walters, Gumbel defended his writing of the memo but conceded that "I 
used language that probably was more colorful and more provocative than it 
needed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel, who rarely gives interviews, said he was ending the press embargo -- at 
least for Walters -- because of "the willingness on the part of a lot of people 
. . . (to believe that) silence indicates guilt." 
</P>
<P>
The interview will be broadcast Friday on ABC News' "20-20." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel spoke at length with Walters on many subjects, including his 
relationship with co-host Deborah Norville, but Walters was especially dogged 
on the topic of the memo. 
</P>
<P>
In the four-page, single-spaced memo, written and stored in NBC's computer 
files, Gumbel had said, among other things, that weatherman Willard Scott 
"holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad 
taste"; that movie reviewer Gene Shalit's reviews "are often late and his 
interviews aren't very good," and that consumer reporter David Horowitz is "a 
walking cliche." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel told Walters that his relationship with Scott is "very good. I like 
Willard," adding that after news of the memo broke, he repeatedly tried to call 
Scott. "We finally got together . . . and we shed a lot of tears over the 
phone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing that I guess grates on me . . . is there is this idea that 
Bryant hatcheted everybody with the program. A reading of the memo indicates 
that 90% of it was absolutely positive."

News coverage of Hurricane Hugo and the devastating San Francisco earthquake 
earned top honors today in the 50th annual Peabody Awards, which often are 
called the Pulitzer Prize of broadcast journalism. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Georgia, which governs the George Foster Peabody Awards 
program, bestowed 27 awards, citing news broadcasts in South Carolina and 
California for providing "an information lifeline" to disaster-stricken 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS-AM radio and KGO-TV in San Francisco captured Peabody awards for coverage 
of the 1989 earthquake, while WCSC-TV in Charleston, S.C., won a Peabody for 
its reporting on Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
Other recipients included CBS Radio News in New York and Cable News Network in 
Atlanta for coverage of last spring's student uprising in China. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasting pioneer J. Leonard Reinsch and veteran newscaster David Brinkley 
of ABC-TV were honored for distinguished careers in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Awards for television dramas went to the CBS movie "Lonesome Dove"; ABC 
Television's "The Wonder Years," "China Beach" and "Small Sacrifices"; and the 
Children's Television Workshop's "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
The awards will be presented in Atlanta at the Peabody Awards Golden 
Anniversary dinner April 3 on the closing night of the National Assn. of 
Broadcasters' annual convention. Winners were chosen from 812 entries.

SHOWS TARGET YOUNG, CBS TELLS ADVERTISERS

CBS told its advertisers and their agencies Wednesday that it was taking aim on 
the young crowd with prime shows in development for the 1990-91 season that 
were animated, musical and featured stand-up comics. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Sagansky, new president of CBS Entertainment, and Peter Tortorici, senior 
vice president of program planning, outlined the third-place network's "game 
plan" for the coming season, describing 23 pilots under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee which of them will actually appear on the schedule when 
it is announced later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS executive pointed to two series that will be different -- "The Pink 
Panther," a mixture of live-action and animation that proved successful in the 
film "Roger Rabbit," and "Shangri La Plaza," described as "a musical half-hour 
which is scored and sung from beginning to end." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the network's effort to broaden its demographic base, Sagansky 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"We have to program younger. The oldest baby boomers are still only 43, and if 
we're not programming to them -- which we do in shows like 'Murphy Brown' and 
'Designing Women' -- then we ought to be programming for their kids and 
teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
Among other shows under consideration for the 8 p.m. period are: 
</P>
<P>
"Big," based on the hit movie, starring Bruce Norris, Darin McGavin and Alison 
LaPlaca. 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Buck," with comic Kevin Meany as an uncouth, ill-mannered and totally 
unprepared head of an unlikely household. 
</P>
<P>
"Broken Badges," a Cajun cop who works with a group of fellow police officers, 
all on psychiatric leave with various mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny," developed around the stand-up comic Lenny Clarke, a blue-collar hero 
with a strong middle-American point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Also "The Flash," based on the DC Comics character; "NYPD Mounted," about an 
odd-couple pair of New York cops on horseback and "The Rock," starring comic 
Joy Behar. 
</P>
<P>
Drama development for the 9 p.m. slot includes "Over My Dead Body," starring 
Edward Woodward as a retired cop turned mystery writer; "Shore Patrol," with 
Rick Schroder in an action series; "WIOU," an ensemble show set in a Midwestern 
television station newsroom (from Grant Tinker's new company), and "Sporting 
Chance," about a one-time star athlete who, after being caught in a betting 
scandal, returns as a sports world private eye. 
</P>
<P>
There are three shows with law environments -- "Bar Girls" about two women 
attorneys; "The Antagonists," about a defense lawyer and a prosecutor who 
compete in solving crimes, and "Hanging Judge," in which a once-idealistic 
judge, after having been slightly disfigured, fights for justice with an array 
of high-tech weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In comedy development for the new season is "Sunday Dinner," a family comedy 
from Norman Lear.

Larry (Big Twist) Nolan, a mountainous rhythm and blues singer who described 
himself in a lyric as "300 pounds of heavenly joy," has died at age 53. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan, whose nickname came from a rumored songwriting credit for the 
dance-inspiring song "The Twist," played concerts for two decades throughout 
the United States and Canada with his band, "Big Twist and the Mellow Fellows." 
</P>
<P>
He died of heart failure Wednesday after the band returned to their home base 
here from a weekend gig in Aspen, Colo., said Alligator Records President Bruce 
Iglauer, who produced two of Nolan's four albums. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the great musical personalities in rhythm and blues," Iglauer 
said of the falsetto-voiced singer. "He built this guy, this persona, of a 
superconfident guy in a white suit. He really was 300 pounds of heavenly joy." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan, who was born in Terre Haute, Ind., and grew up in southern Illinois, 
left a wife and seven children.

Miss America Debbye Turner has agreed not to sing Christian rap songs to public 
school children, a pageant official says. 
</P>
<P>
The decision follows a complaint Feb. 12 by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai 
B'rith in New York, pageant Director Leonard Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Sinensky, civil rights director for the league, said Wednesday that 
pageant officials satisfied questions his organization raised after seeing a 
newspaper article in Detroit about Turner's appearance at a public school. 
</P>
<P>
"She delivered an overt Christian message in terms of Jesus Christ being the 
truth, light and way," Sinensky said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, a veterinary student from Missouri, has been a born-again Christian 
since she was 7.

LIZ SMITH: BRYANT GUMBEL TALKS HIS HEAD OFF TO WALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Liz Smith

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I WOULD say that Bryant Gumbel is an emotional guy, and where possible we 
should capitalize on it, and where it hurts us, we should try to minimize it . 
. . and he's not the one who should be the heavyweight, and so we should make 
the heavyweight decisions, and make sure that Bryant stays in the background," 
says Bryant himself to Barbara Walters in an evaluation of -- Bryant Gumbel! 
</P>
<P>
You can see this exchange and a lot of other stuff this Friday night on ABC's 
"20/20" when Gumbel talks his head off to Walters. They address the infamous 
"Today" show memo, the one that caused Willard Scott's toupee to stand up all 
by itself. 
</P>
<P>
They ramble over Bryant's alleged "arrogance" and how he gets along with his 
mom and dad and what his future hopes are and, of course, the Jane 
Pauley-Deborah Norville question. (A question, let's not forget, that the NBC 
peacock caused to be raised all by itself and created into a tangled web.) 
</P>
<P>
BARBARA ASKS Bryant: "Did you want Jane Pauley to stay?" He says, "I wanted 
Jane Pauley to be happy in what she did." (I guess we might say that Bryant 
doesn't exactly answer Barbara's question.) 
</P>
<P>
Barbara leads hims, saying maybe Jane would have been happy staying at the main 
desk and letting Deborah do the news. She remarks rather aggressively to 
Gumbel: "You could have made it happen." He demurs: "I'm not sure I could have 
made it happen, Barbara, I mean, you know, hindsight's perfect." Gumbel asserts 
that if he'd interfered, it might have been interpeted as trying to stunt 
Norville's career. Then he says "No" three separate times to the question of 
whether there is any truth to the rumor that NBC is thinking of putting Jane 
back on the "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara asks Bryant: "If they could bring Jane Pauley back, if she would come 
back . . . would you like that? Would it help?" Gumbel again steps over the 
query and counters with another one: "To take my place or Deborah's?" They spar 
a moment, then he says: "Oh, I don't know. I think it's always difficult to 
rewrite history, Barbara. I think the idea of bringing Jane back right now, 
while certainly a pleasant one for a lot of people to consider, would be 
fraught with so many difficulties involved, and so many hurt feelings, and so 
much discomfort for all included, including Jane, that I think it's kind of an 
unrealistic thing to even consider." 
</P>
<P>
You'll have to tune in for the rest. As it is, I more or less "stole" this 
portion and am breaking a release date. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE talking about Jane Pauley's new persona these days. This girl is 
literally walking on air. Nobody has ever seen her quite like this before. 
Nobody has ever known a Jane Pauley who went about popping out her chest and 
busting her buttons with pride and joy. So if you are a Jane Pauley fan, that 
should make you feel good for Jane. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe our darling old peacock, NBC, will decide that they've made an 
inadvertent star out of Jane and give her all those night-time slots I told you 
the other day might not happen. It would be nice to be wrong here. 
</P>

BOB HOPE is rounding up the Sports Illustrated swimsuit lassies for his NBC

Habitat for Humanity, an organization that builds housing for the poor, hopes 
to recruit electrician Lech Walesa and carpenter Jimmy Carter to work on a 
project in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Clive Rainey, Habitat's senior associate for development, said he visited 
Poland recently to lay the groundwork for a project that could include 
renovation and expansion of former government-owned buildings for apartments. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes Walesa, the leader of Poland's Solidarity labor movement and 
an electrician by trade, works on the project with Carter, the former President 
who has done carpentry work on dozens of Habitat buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Rainey said an official at Solidarity in Gdansk told him Walesa would like to 
become an honorary board member if Habitat establishes a Polish affiliate.

Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has joined the advisory board of 
Trevor's Campaign for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is the brainchild of 11-year-old Trevor Ferrell, who in 1983 began 
handing out blankets to people sleeping on the streets. The program has 
expanded with volunteers delivering food and clothing to the homeless in 16 
cities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Koop served as surgeon in chief of Children's Hospital in Philadelphia from 
1948 until 1981, when he was sworn in as surgeon general. His appointment to 
the homeless campaign was announced Tuesday.

MCARTHUR LIFTS SANTA BARBARA TO 70-66 VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
Eric McArthur scored three of his 20 points in the final 59 seconds today, 
lifting UC Santa Barbara to a 70-66 victory over Houston in the first round of 
the NCAA tournament's Southeast Regional at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
McArthur, who also grabbed 11 rebounds for the Gauchos (21-8), hit on a follow 
shot with 59 seconds left, giving Santa Barbara a 67-66 lead. He connected on a 
free throw with 28 seconds left for a 68-66 Gauchos' edge. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's Paul Johnson sealed the victory with two free throws with two 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Houston (25-7) had led only once in the second half, 47-46, before scoring six 
straight points for a 66-65 lead. Craig Upchurch's follow-up with 1:17 
remaining put the Cougars ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Houston had several chances to regain the lead after falling behind again, but 
Byron Smith, who finished with 18 points, missed a jumper with 24 seconds left 
and McArthur stole a pass by Houston's Kason Jackson with 10 seconds to play, 
setting up Johnson's free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara broke from a 32-32 halftime tie behind McArthur, who scored six 
of the Gauchos' first 10 points as they took a 44-37 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gray had 15 points and Carrick DeHart scored 11 for Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart, Santa Barbara's career scoring leader, had seven points in the first 
three minutes, but managed only four in the final 37 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Herrera topped Houston with 19 points. Upchurch finished with 11. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 77 
</P>
<P>
Towson State 68 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Oklahoma, fighting for its tournament life against No. 16 seed 
Towson State, survived a sluggish effort for a 77-68 victory over the Tigers in 
the opening game of the NCAA Midwest Regional at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Jones scored 19 points for the Sooners (27-4), who advance to Saturday's 
second round against the winner of today's North Carolina and Southwest 
Missouri State game. Towson State, winner of the East Coast Conference 
tournament, ended its season 18-13. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners never trailed, but there were some anxious moments. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 12 at halftime, Towson State outscored the Sooners 6-2 to move 
within 47-39. Later, a three-minute scoring drought by Oklahoma allowed the 
Tigers to come within 58-54 with 8:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
Kurk Lee, who finished with 30 points, scored 14 of the Tigers' first 25 points 
after halftime, including six in a row as they climbed to 60-58 with 6:45 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But 3-pointers by Terry Evans and Smokey McCovery widened the Sooners' lead to 
66-60 with 5:21 left, and Evans added another 3-pointer with 1:41 left that 
made the score 73-67. Towson State got no closer than five after that. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first appearance in the NCAA tournament for Towson State. Oklahoma 
is making its eighth straight tournament appearance, a Big Eight Conference 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma led 45-33 after a first half that saw the Sooners commit 11 turnovers 
and miss 12-of-18 free throws. Towson State shot 34% and was assessed two 
technicals -- one against Lee for hanging on the rim after missing a dunk and 
one against Coach Terry Truax for arguing a charging call. 
</P>
<P>
That call erased a dunk by Chuck Lightening that would have brought the Tigers 
within eight points with four minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma looked early as though it would roll over Towson State, taking a 12-2 
lead in the first 3 minutes, 30 seconds. But the Tigers settled down and scored 
the next nine points. 
</P>
<P>
An 19-6 run by the Sooners during the next seven minutes, however, gave them a 
31-17 lead. The run could have been greater, but Oklahoma missed six straight 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 49 
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young 47 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland Howling scored his only points on two 3-point shots in the final 2:32, 
including the winning basket with 31 seconds left, as 17th-ranked Clemson edged 
Brigham Young 49-47 in the first round of the NCAA East Regional at Hartford, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
A free throw by Andy Toolson with 2:42 left gave the Cougars a 47-40 lead, and 
they didn't score again. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (25-8) had just five field goals in the second half but closed to 
47-43 on Howling's first basket with 2:32 to go. Clemson, which made only 14 of 
its 30 foul shots, got two from Marion Cash that cut the margin to 47-45 with 
1:26 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Toolson led Brigham Young (21-9) with 15 points but missed a 3-pointer with 41 
seconds to go and five seconds on the shot clock. The taller Tigers got the 
rebound and worked the ball to Howling, to the left of the foul circle, for the 
go-ahead basket. 
</P>
<P>
With eight seconds remaining, BYU guard Marty Haws just missed an alley-oop 
layup attempt and Clemson got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Jones made a free throw for Clemson with five seconds to play but missed 
the second, and Todd Crow rebounded for the Cougars. They rushed up court, but 
center Steve Schreiner missed a long desperation jumper at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson was led by Elden Campbell with 15 points. Haws had 11 for Brigham 
Young. Clemson held a 49-32 rebounding advantage while each team made just 33 
percent of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson, the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season champion for the first 
time, won for the second time in five games. BYU, which shared the Western 
Athletic Conference regular-season title with Colorado State, suffered its 
third straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's second round, Clemson plays the winner of today's game between 
12th-ranked La Salle and Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson led 28-23 at halftime but was outscored 14-5 in the first 9:14 of the 
second half and fell behind 37-33. Cash hit a 3-pointer for the Tigers' third 
field goal of the half with 10:26 to go. But a 10-4 run by BYU opened the lead 
to 47-40. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson got off to a slow start but finished the first half strongly. Brigham 
Young took a 9-2 lead on Haws' layup with 14:48 left, then trailed briefly 
before a 3-point shot by Toolson gave the Cougars a 23-20 lead with 33:05 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't score again in the half as Clemson ran off the last eight points on 
a short hook by Wayne Buckingham, a jumper by Jones and layups by Dale Davis 
and Derrick Forrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State 54 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State 53 
</P>
<P>
Paris McCurdy converted a three-point play with no time remaining to give Ball 
State a 54-53 victory over Oregon State in the first round of the NCAA West 
Regional at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
McCurdy was fouled by Karl Anderson while hitting a five-footer on the baseline 
as time expired and sank the free throw to give 12th-seeded Ball State the win. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State, seeded fifth, took the lead when Teo Alibegovic hit a turnaround 
jumper with three seconds left to give the Beavers a 53-51 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But a court-length pass went out of bounds off an OSU player, and Ball State 
retained possession under its own basket with two seconds remaining. McCurdy, 
who finished with eight points, took the inbounds pass on the baseline and was 
fouled by Anderson.

Leigh Ann Fetter of Texas today became the first woman to swim the 50-yard 
freestyle in less than 22 seconds as she set U.S. Open, American and NCAA 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Fetter's time of 21.92 seconds came on the first day of the NCAA Women's 
Swimming and Diving Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The finals are scheduled tonight. Fetter, a junior from Louisville, Ky., held 
the U.S., American and NCAA records of 22.05, a time she swam in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The second-fastest qualifier in the 50-yard freestyle was Jennifer Boyd, a 
Brown senior, with a time of 22.39. Olympic gold medal winner Janet Evans of 
Stanford led qualifiers in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:39.03, which 
was not close to the U.S., American or NCAA records. Evans, a freshman from 
Placentia, holds three world records in the 400-meter, 800-meter and 
1,500-meter.

DICKERSON GETS OK TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE TRADE

<P>
Colts owner Robert Irsay has given his star running back, Eric Dickerson, 
permission to approach two teams to put together a possible trade. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson has said he would like to be traded to either Washington or the New 
York Giants if he were to leave the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't offered Eric to either of those teams," Irsay said Wednesday in 
Orlando, Fla., where the NFL meetings are being held this week. 
</P>
<P>
"All I've done is give Eric permission to talk with the teams and see what they 
would be willing to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Joe Gibbs said he doesn't believe that the Redskins would be 
able to obtain Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in this league would have an interest in Eric Dickerson if things 
could be worked out," Gibbs said. "We do have some darned good runners. What 
did they trade to get him . . . the stadium, three owners and half the team?" 
</P>
<P>
Giants General Manager George Young said negotiating a Dickerson trade "is not 
one of my priorities." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is a wonderful player," Young said. "I'm not going to say I would 
say no to him." 
</P>
<P>
Young added, however, "When a player shows an interest to be traded, it's 
normally a ploy in an attempt to get more money." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irsay said Wednesday that he knew nothing about a rumor that the 
Colts were one of four teams Miami quarterback Dan Marino wanted to consider in 
a possible trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with Mr. (Chris) Chandler and Mr. (Jack) Trudeau as my 
quarterbacks," Irsay said, but added, "We would always talk with Miami if they 
called."

Mark Miles of Indianapolis, director of corporate relations for Eli Lilly and

the tennis group said today.

In a statement, the ATP said Miles, 36, of Indianapolis will replace Jordan 
"after a period of transition." Jordan will become chairman of the board of the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy and comfortable to be turning over my responsibilities to Mark," 
Jordan said in the statement. "In a sense, Mark brings the best of both worlds 
to this position. He is an outsider in the sense that his professional career 
has been outside of tennis. . . . Yet Mark has played tennis all his life."

Desert Orchid, the 11-year-old gray regarded as Britain's most popular 
thoroughbred, ran out of stamina today in the most-hyped race of his career and 
finished third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Norton's Coin, a 100-1 long shot, won the steeplechase, the longest-priced 
winner in the 66-year history of the event, second only to the Grand National 
in prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Toby Tobias, an 8-1 shot, was second, three-quarters of a length behind the 
winner. Desert Orchid and jockey Richard Dunwoody were four lengths farther 
back. Nine other horses started. 
</P>
<P>
Off at 10-11 odds, Desert Orchid was the hottest Gold Cup favorite in 15 years 
as he attempted to become only the sixth horse to win the 3 1/4-mile race 
twice.

THE GAME WE KNOW NEEDS NURTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY LA RUE, MC CLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One warm, blue-skied day soon, with the last frost behind us and while the air 
is still crisp and alive, we are going to have to talk about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
We have to, because for a generation or so, the game has been changing. As have 
we all. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who remember have an obligation to talk about baseball, about the 
game we knew, because much of it still exists. It needs to be dusted off and 
nurtured. 
</P>
<P>
Money has changed the game, but money has changed us all. Saying the players of 
yesteryear weren't concerned with salaries is like saying each of us would be 
willing to go back to that first job out of college and live on what we made 
then. 
</P>
<P>
Once, it seemed a lot of money. Once, it probably was. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1990, Will Clark's agent will make more money than Ted Williams earned 
in his career. And the New York Yankees have a 12-year cable television 
contract worth $485 million. 
</P>
<P>
We need to talk baseball before we begin to think of it as just another 
American industry. And before our children do. 
</P>
<P>
We need to talk baseball before batting gloves. Before baserunners wore sliding 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
We need to remember baseball when Pete Rose hustled on the field, not off. When 
all stadiums were outdoors and all grass was real. 
</P>
<P>
We need to talk baseball without Fehr and loathing, because what is happening 
now isn't the fault of the game. And when today's owners and today's players 
are gone, the game won't be. Not if enough of us remember it. And talk it. 
</P>
<P>
Talk baseball when Bob Gibson threw a purpose pitch and when Frank Robinson got 
back up, dusted himself off and stood in the box glaring at the mound, bat 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a game with players like Yogi Berra, who took comic books on team 
trains, loved kids and thought most of a newspaper was something to wrap the 
sports section in. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the uniforms were flannel and so baggy a man might get blown off base in 
a good strong wind. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Don Drysdale went into Buzzie Bavasi's office to talk contract figures -- 
and Bavasi wrote down different figures on scraps of paper, then told Drysdale 
to pick one. 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale did and went away happy. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about baseball before trading cards were investments, when they were 
collected because a guy had a great sounding name, or just because he played 
for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about the baseball that drew men, women and children to its parks wanting 
to watch the game, not drink beer. When a kid in the upper deck wouldn't hear 
words he'd have to have explained. 
</P>
<P>
We live in complex times, and that has been hard on a simple game. Greed isn't 
new. Nor obstinacy. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps what we see at baseball's bargaining table these days is merely 
what we see elsewhere. Greyhound buses are being shot at -- with a lot less 
money at stake. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps that is why we need to talk baseball. To get the game back where it 
belongs, in our imaginations, our memories. 
</P>
<P>
We need to honor a game and forget, at times, those who dishonor it. With luck, 
baseball will survive commissioners without courage, owners who feel they 
answer to no one and players who want a lifetime of opulence for a few years of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
We should talk baseball, because in remembering what was, perhaps we will see 
that much of that same magic remains. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, baseball will return. And if we view it the way owners and players 
are viewing it now, the game will have lost more than a few months. It will 
have lost all those reasons we ever talked baseball.

IF THE RAIDERS CAN DO IT (SIGH), HOW ABOUT THE LONG-LOST COLTS?

 -- The Raiders are moving back to Oakland. (Sigh) 
</P>
<P>
You try it. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are moving back to Oakland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
(Sigh) 
</P>
<P>
It's darn near impossible to say the words without conjuring up another move 
and images of trucks rolling in reverse, back in time, back in space, back from 
Indy, back to us. If the Raiders can move back to Oakland, couldn't the Colts? 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
No. They couldn't. They're not. They won't (unless you see Bob Irsay 
negotiating with Irwindale; then, maybe). Go ahead: Sigh. 
</P>
<P>
But at least truth and justice reside somewhere in the world, if not in our 
particular part of it. Like sweet Loretta Martin, the Raiders get back, get 
back, get back to where they once belonged. You see, people will occasionally 
do the right thing. All you have to do is give them a $600-million nudge, which 
is what Al Davis was given to bring the Raiders back to their rightful home. 
</P>
<P>
OK, it wasn't romance. You want romance in the sports world, you get a date and 
rent a baseball movie. And don't look for any trend developing here. The 
Donald's not going back to Ivana. The Dodgers aren't returning to Brooklyn. Rob 
Lowe's not going back to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
This is just business. Whatever anyone says, you can go home again, if the 
price is right, and $600 million over 15 years is so right, it's what we used 
to call righteous. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money is in ticket guarantees, just so the team doesn't have any 
incentive to do any sales work of its own, and the rest comes in improvements 
to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, including the building of luxury boxes 
that rich people can lease and then write off on their taxes. There are some 
city councilmen in Oakland who have expressed concern over the size of the 
guarantee for a city that has too many homeless people in the street and not 
enough teachers in the classroom. But at least it's got football. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, 37,000 seats in the revamped stadium will cost at least $30. And a lot of 
ticket-holders are going to have to commit in advance to pay a premium ranging 
from $2,000 to $16,000. And, for Oakland just to break even, the Raiders will 
have to average 57,000 fans over the next 15 years. It's a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't Los Angeles see the obvious advantages of such a bonanza? Funny you 
should ask. It seems the folks in L.A. were so sick of Davis and his 
will-he-or-won't-he stance on a home for the Raiders that, according to a 
recent poll, 83% of the people said they didn't care if the Raiders left or 
buried themselves in an Irwindale gravel pit. And politicians, whatever else 
their flaws, all know how to count. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. position contrasts nicely with the Oakland population, who, when the 
Raiders left, voted ashes and sackcloth as the official town uniform. The 
people in Oakland will welcome Davis back as the prodigal son. They'll forgive, 
if not forget. The team is theirs again; that's what counts. 
</P>
<P>
There has been much made of the fact that the Raiders, dressed in silver and 
black, the Hell's Angels of pro football, belong in blue-collar Oakland and not 
rhinestone-collar Los Angeles. All the cliches are being rolled out. We hear 
about the post-Perrier depression in L.A. and how the only time anyone drinks 
any kind of water in Oakland is as a chaser. Actually, Oakland has a sizable 
yuppie population, and Los Angeles, home to the Crips and Bloods, is the 
drive-by shooting capital of the world. If the Raiders like to think of 
themselves as outlaws, Los Angeles is as good a place as any to live. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, in the Raiders' good years in L.A., they averaged over 70,000 fans. 
They averaged 50,000 last season amid all the rumors of flight and in the 
just-win-babies' fourth consecutive season out of the playoffs. Maybe the 
streets aren't paved with football fans, but you can make a living here. 
</P>
<P>
But, enough of their problems. This is basically a happy ending, anyway. The 
question we should be asking: What does this mean to Baltimore? More good news. 
This move obviously takes Oakland out of the running as an expansion site and 
also effectively removes Sacramento, which is in the same end of California as 
San Francisco and Oakland, thereby losing out to geography. There's as good a 
chance the National Football League will put an expansion team in the L.A. 
Coliseum as there is in the Rome Colosseum, which is only slightly older and 
also doesn't have luxury boxes. That leaves the usual suspects -- Memphis, 
Tenn.; St. Louis; Jacksonville, Fla.; Charlotte, N.C.; San Antonio and 
Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
If the NFL expands by two teams, Baltimore seems to have a great chance. If it 
expands by four -- and there are indications that might happen -- Baltimore is 
a lock. Of course, there's the nasty matter of when, and if the NFL, under its 
new commissioner, is sincere about sticking to the concept of no expansion 
before a labor agreement, then we may be teamless for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves us -- what? -- sighing? 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe we could float $600 million Bob Irsay's way. That would pay for the 
move back, with enough left over to pay the bar tab.

Unbridled was installed today as the favorite for Saturday's $500,000 Florida 
Derby at Gulfstream Park, and the long shot claimed the rail. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Streava, official odds maker for the track, didn't wait for the drawings 
before making Unbridled, who finished third in the Fountain of Youth stakes, a 
5-2 pick. 
</P>
<P>
Ross's Warning, the long shot at 20-1, drew the rail. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day will ride Unbridled, which drew the fourth position in the nine-horse 
field. Slavic was rated second at 3-1 and drew the eighth position; Single Dawn 
was set at 4-1 and drew the ninth position for the 1 1/8-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
Roanoke was at 6-1 and drew the sixth position, followed by Country Day at 8-1 
starting in the fifth position. Run Turn, at 10-1, was at the seventh position 
and Top Snob, at 12-1, drew the third slot. Late entry Sunny Serve, also at 
12-1, claimed the second spot. 
</P>
<P>
Track officials also announced that the Swale Stakes will be moved up to the 
fifth race because of the interest in several potential contenders in this 
year's somewhat muddled 3-year-old field. 
</P>
<P>
The race was originally scheduled to be run 11th, after the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream officials expect a fast track Saturday with warm and breezy weather. 
</P>
<P>
In the Swale Stakes, Summer Squall, on medication after bleeding in a workout a 
month ago, was installed as a slight favorite at 8-5 with Housebuster at 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger, trainer for Unbridled, said he was a little surprised that his 
horse was picked as a Florida Derby favorite but said: "I don't get too excited 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
He was pleased with the position drawings for his two horses, Unbridled and Top 
Snob. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real happy. . . . You don't want the rail and you don't want to be too 
far on the outside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of injuries and lackluster performances this year for some of the early 
Kentucky Derby contenders, the Florida Derby and the 3-year-old picture remain 
filled with question marks. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the race is wide open," said Sonny Hine, trainer for Ross's Warning. 
"That's why we're going to run it." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Perret, who will be riding Roanoke, said he feels that the best horses 
this year have yet to have strong showings. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes the Florida Derby a wide-open thing," he said.
