'SOME GIRLS': A MODERN FAIRY TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Who could guess that behind an unprepossessing ad and the sort of title built 
to keep audiences out of theaters, there lurks a radiantly beautiful, even 
memorable film about the ineffable mysteries of women? "Some Girls" (opening 
Friday at the Century Plaza Cinemas) is the victim in question, a smart, 
enticing enchantment that may be the first sexual comedy to look like an Art 
Nouveau fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
Love brings Eastern-born Michael (Patrick Dempsey) to Quebec City for his 
Christmas holidays, and into the sophisticated, utterly eccentric milieu of the 
D'Arc family, author/father (Andre Gregory), mother (Florinda Bolkan) and their 
three delectable daughters, 13 to 24 years old, each more ravishing than the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
It's the middle one, his college classmate Gabriella, (Jennifer Connelly) who 
has invited Michael up, then kept him waiting forlornly at the airport. She 
will show up, unapologetic, in a fur hat and red, red lipstick, like a fairy 
tale princess. Her arrival is delayed just long enough for us to understand 
that the references to the Three Graces on the vast Botticelli poster behind 
Michael are hardly accidental. They are no less deliberate than "Eine Kleine 
Nachtmusik" bubbling charmingly in the background; for the greatest part of its 
running time, the completely contemporary "Some Girls" will come with the 
beauty of Botticelli and the delicacy of Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
Michael's introduction to the family is a beaut. Father, who hates to be 
encumbered by clothes when he writes, is a cheerful agnostic; mother, an 
obedient Catholic with a family confessor at her elbow. The electricity has 
failed, the stained glass, tapestries and Art Nouveau paneling are lit by 
fantastic candelabra, and if the servants came over from their off-days at the 
palace of "Beauty and the Beast" it would feel exactly right. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no servants, here everyone pitches in; the D'Arc wealth is 
intellectual and spiritual, not showy. This is one of those close-knit, 
artistic families that England also specializes in; they get by 
one-isn't-exactly-sure-how, but with a sure touch and lashings of style. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet Michael, not brash and not as cool as he imagines, is in wildly over his 
head. Hard not to be, but it reduces him to remarks like, "Great door," the 
sort of cotton-brained comment induced by these dazzling surroundings. His 
distress is compounded when Gabriella announces she's not in love with him 
anymore, but he might as well stay out the week. 
</P>
<P>
And so the stage is set for Michael's initiation into the heady, open-handed, 
uncompetitive world of the D'Arc women: Gabriella, flowing-haired Irenka 
(Sheila Kelley), and "little" Simone (Ashley Greenfield). He's drawn, too, into 
a rondelet of innocent bedtime visits by sisters other than Gabriella and 
fierce spot checks by their ferociously protective mother, "only looking for 
Beowulf," the family dog. It will be Michael's lot to be innocent when things 
look worst, and to attract disastrous sexual situations with the sureness of 
blue serge and lint. 
</P>
<P>
Last of the dynasty to surface is Granny (Lila Kedrova), Bolkan's mother, whose 
memory lapses and gradual downward spiral have all the women in her family 
deeply concerned. However, on her first sight of Michael, Granny brightens: to 
her he is her deceased husband and nothing will sway her from that belief. 
</P>
<P>
If Rupert Walters' screenplay teeters at times into farce, it's farce of an 
innocent, hilarious nature, and when it takes a turn for the mystical, it's 
delicately achieved. Director Michael Hoffman may get carried away at the 
film's end by careening action that is too broad by far, but his work with 
actors is marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
He seems to have drawn the best and most delicate performances from everyone, 
but most especially from Patrick Dempsey, who doesn't have a strained moment in 
the piece, and from Andre Gregory, whose musing on the mysterious nature of 
women is the film's highlight. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey has had major roles earlier (you may remember him as Sonny Wisecarver 
in the misfired "In the Mood"), but nothing before has hinted at his range, his 
perfect comic placement or his capacity for tenderness, wonder and a certain 
wild apprehension, all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
All three sisters are a joy; individually glorious, they are also wonderful at 
creating a mood of mutual appreciation and almost-subliminal rapport. Kedrova 
can be iffy: as she has demonstrated more than once, she can be as mannered as 
Luise Rainer or as innocently fey as she is here. This role is one of her best, 
and since her rapport with Dempsey is crucial, it's nice to be able to say that 
it seems extraordinary, lifting the story to its final, tender plane. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Girls"(rated R for nudity and very brief salty language) was produced by 
Hoffman's usual partner, Rick Stevenson ("Restless Natives") for Robert 
Redford's Wildwood Enterprises, and Nicoletta Massone's evocative costumes and 
Ueli Steiger's rich, glowing camera work deserve special mention. 
</P>
<P>
However, there's another element: No lover of superior production design should 
miss Eugenio Zanetti's astonishing work, which creates the world of this wildly 
eclectic family with wit and absolute authority. If this had been a production 
budgeted at 20 times more, Zanetti's work would still be stunning; to have done 
it on the budget reported for this production is something close to a miracle. 
You might hope that this is the sort of achievement that would not go unnoticed 
when awards for artistic ingenuity are being considered.

ALVIN AILEY INTRODUCES 'SHARDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alvin Ailey has always had a deep grasp of dance history -- of making it as 
well as preserving it. 
</P>
<P>
Just over 30 years ago, Ailey introduced his brave, new seven-member company to 
an audience at the 92nd Street YMHA in New York. American dance hasn't been the 
same since. Not only did Ailey enlarge the ridiculously limited opportunities 
for black dancers and radically update the condescendingly exotic image of 
black dance, he created the nation's most enduring modern-dance repertory 
ensemble. Who else dances everything from classics by the pioneers of the art 
(Ted Shawn, Katherine Dunham) to experiments by young choreographers on loan 
from the avant-garde (Bill T. Jones, Donald Byrd)? 
</P>
<P>
Now 28-strong, the Ailey ensemble returned to the Wiltern Theatre on Tuesday 
(sponsored by UCLA) with a relatively sober program spanning the last two 
decades of its existence (earlier Ailey milestones will come later in the 
six-day engagement). 
</P>
<P>
From 1969: "Masekela Langage" (music by Hugh Masekela), Ailey's bitter portrait 
of bar habitues taking desperate refuge in pop music, drugs, drink and sex to 
escape the ominous realities of living in South Africa. From 10 years later: 
"Memoria" (music by Keith Jarrett), his surging, large-scale tribute to the 
late dancer, choreographer and original Ailey company member, Joyce Trisler. 
</P>
<P>
"Memoria" also represents a slick example of the choreographic style 
</P>
<P>
identified first with Ailey and now, 
</P>
<P>
for better or worse, synonymous with black dance: a collage of balletic 
extensions, modern-dance torso articulation, percussive social-dance footwork 
and rhythms plus a major reliance on expressive gesture. 
</P>
<P>
This style is put under a microscope in the final work on the program, Donald 
Byrd's impressive "Shards," a showpiece that's always easy to watch but also 
gets at intriguing creative issues. Choreographed last year for a dozen members 
of the company, it fractures and reassembles the components of Ailey-style in 
rigorous neo-minimalist terms, with an emphasis on startling contrasts in 
dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
A dancer's arm abruptly shoots forward and then is slowly, softly pulled back 
to graze the face. Formal, balletic turns-in-extension dissolve in wiggly 
colloquial motion. Gestural statements that resemble streamlined 
postmodernizations of Ailey's powerful, recurrent "Buked and Scorned" motif 
from "Revelations" alternate with sleek passages of dance-as-pure-design. 
</P>
<P>
Such sharp push/pull oppositions become a major rhythm in "Shards," 
underpinning the moody wash of sound provided by Mio Morales. But it is 
classical ballet that increasingly becomes Byrd's preoccupation (just as it has 
sometimes been Ailey's): All the playoffs with other movement forms only 
heighten the centrality of the ballet vocabulary, repertory and even hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that designer Gabriel Berry's tiered skirts reconceive the tutu 
in contemporary terms, Byrd remakes the Rose Adagio for Elizabeth Roxas and 
four men with the priorities of both past and present intently in focus. 
</P>
<P>
It's as if he's trying to define his own place in the continuity of dance 
tradition by investigating links to Ailey, to Balanchine and to the street. 
Thus his duets for the statuesque Dana Hash and the muscular Carl Bailey 
juxtapose lyrical and visceral impulses brilliantly just as his big, 
super-formal finale almost manages to fuse all the resources of '80s American 
dance in one generous act of homage. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd is best known as a dance rebel, outrageous and fearless. But "Shards" 
explores his influences and inspirations while transforming them for dancers of 
his own generation -- a surprise, perhaps, but hardly a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
The Ailey dancers executed "Shards" forcefully on Tuesday, with Bailey in 
particular relishing every shift of idiom. In "Memoria," April Berry portrayed 
the initially suffering and then triumphant central figure very stylishly 
indeed, but the evening's most spectacular performance may have been Dereque 
Whiturs' dangerously volatile dancing as the jukebox-obsessed junkie in 
"Masekela Langage." After 30 years, this company can still confound our 
expectations -- and the proof is at the Wiltern through Sunday.

Linda Ellerbee and John McLaughlin are coming to cable TV, but on separate 
fronts. Starting Monday, Ellerbee, a registered irreverent, will be a 
three-times-a-week commentator on CNN. She has been an ad hoc commentator there 
-- having covered the presidential conventions and the 1988 election -- since 
leaving ABC News after the axing of "Our World" in 1987. "I had a wonderful 
time during the conventions," Ellerbee told The Times Wednesday. "The nice part 
is CNN lets me say what I think, without first telling me what I think." 
McLaughlin, the conservative host of "The McLaughlin Group" that gathers 
Sundays to bellow about matters of great import and consequence, has signed 
with NBC's new consumer news and financial channel, CNBC. He will do 
"McLaughlin," a one-hour weeknight interview show to be taped before studio 
audiences at CNBC headquarters in Ft. Lee, N.J. Like CNBC, the new show will 
start on April 17. ALEENE MacMINN

conference to promote their two-week run at the Wiltern that starts March 27. 
Penn Jillette, left, did the talking while Teller apparently held his breath 
underwater for about 7 1/2 minutes. Proceeds from the opening night will

The New York Times no longer will allow its critics to vote in awards 
competitions, including the prestigious New York Film Critics, New York Drama 
Critics, Tony and National Book balloting. After discussions with critics and 
arts editors, Times executive editor Max Frankel banned participation of Times 
critics in awards distributed in all fields outside of journalism. Frankel said 
the paper, which publishes its own 10 best lists every year, will allocate more 
space to critics and arts writers. A spokeswoman for the New York paper said 
Wednesday that "we see ourselves as having to be more objective, having some 
separation between reporting on the arts and being part of the process that 
votes on awards given." ALEENE MacMINN

HIGGINS' 'BONU$ BABY' BELONGS IN THE MINORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing in any book of rules that suggests that a play about baseball 
should give you the thrill of the game. But a play about anything should give 
you a thrill of some kind. 
</P>
<P>
David Higgins' "Bonu$ Baby" at the Victory Theatre in Burbank doesn't. Some of 
the problem is in the play, some in the production. They combine to deliver 
much talk and little action. 
</P>
<P>
This is a back room play. It focuses on a young ball player, Artie, and all the 
shenanigans that surround his incipient rise to fame (including consideration 
of a signing bonus that would make Artie the bonus baby of the title), but it 
does it mostly through lots of conversation. The kid is about to be signed by a 
significant team. He has a reputation for wildness that may or may not stand in 
his way. His coach thinks it won't. And since it appears the kid is having an 
affair with the coach's daughter, you know who's side he's going to be on. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins' play is not quite that uncomplicated. It has a nice couple of scenes 
in the second act that make it almost worth sitting through the first act (we 
won't divulge their content). But by then it's too little too late. 
</P>
<P>
Act I is divided into two sets of conversations: One between the team scout 
Charlie (Tom Simcox) and the coach, Hollie (Tom Bower), as they sit around a 
table in the back room of Milt Galloway's Bar in Oakland -- and the other 
between the kid Artie (Kevin Holczer) and his girl-friend Tracy (Karen Person), 
the coach's daughter, as they sit around his unfinished bedroom talking about 
cabbages and kings and mothers and fathers and maybe getting married. 
</P>
<P>
The year is 1964 and D. Martyn Bookwalter's crowded two-part set -- house and 
bar -- reflects it. But the action is static, swinging like a slow pendulum 
from one side of the set -- or one locale -- to the other. 
</P>
<P>
There are two more characters who drift in and out of that back room in Milt's 
bar: Milt himself (Jack Andreozzi) and Hollie's friend Sid (Charles Cyphers) an 
old-time veteran reporter. Neither is essential to the play nor vivid enough as 
written to be justified as local color. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the problems in Higgins' script are the problems in the production. 
Director James Gammon does not maximize its potential. He extracts little juice 
from the chauvinistic jock talk which merely feels excessive and, in the mouths 
of some of the less experienced actors, even phony. 
</P>
<P>
The play's tempo slouches when it doesn't sag. Cues and blackouts are slow. 
Andreozzi seems ill at ease as Milt. The script gives Cyphers, a strong actor, 
too little to contribute as the seasoned ink-stained wretch. 
</P>
<P>
There is no chemistry to speak of between Person and Holczer (a late 
replacement in the role). All the talk we hear about Artie's rebellious nature 
is dispelled by Holczer's tentative presence. And all the talk we hear about 
Tracy's fighting spirit (and her reported actions later in the play) dissolves 
before Person's laid-back performance. 
</P>
<P>
Only Tom Bower as Hollie, and to a lesser degree Simcox as the scout Charlie, 
are on target. Bower is the linchpin of the play and carries it to the finish 
in a delightfully understated manner that makes the surprises he delivers at 
the end all the more effective. 
</P>
<P>
But Higgins should take another look at his script. Too much of it is not 
compelling, cluttered with extraneous material and incomplete thoughts. (Why, 
for instance, is Artie's house unfinished? And why is the painting above the 
bed, if it must be there, not attributed to his father?) Above all, however, 
it's the action that's missing. It doesn't do just to talk about what's 
happened or is happening. We need to see it on stage.

D'RIVERA OFFERS MORE THAN BASICS AT CATALINA'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paquito D'Rivera, the Cuban saxophonist who docked at Catalina's Bar and Grill 
in Hollywood on Tuesday, believes in giving the people value for money. 
</P>
<P>
Example: In what was announced as an original composition dedicated to Carmen 
McRae, he managed to include quotes from "Mona Lisa," "Samba de Orfeu," 
"Pagliacci," "Allen's Alley" and a couple of other unidentified flying 
melodies. Seven tunes for the price of one. 
</P>
<P>
The basic melody was pleasant enough, though it might have worked 
advantageously at a less frenetic tempo. Even D'Rivera seemed aware of this. 
Granting that the pace was "a bit hectic," he said: "Now we'd like to offer our 
South of the Border version of 'Summertime.' " 
</P>
<P>
Starting with a synthesizer vamp by Cocho Abres, this took almost five minutes 
to get to "Summertime" itself, played in 6/4 time, followed by a 4/4 passage 
leading to a clarinet-and-cymbal interlude, a keening guitar foray by Fareed 
Haque, and an alto saxophone solo in which D'Rivera managed to incorporate bits 
and pieces from "Rhapsody in Blue" and "But Not For Me." 
</P>
<P>
On a final samba the rhythmic accents were underlined by two Peruvians, Oscar 
Estagnaro on bass and Alex Acuna, the highly regarded drummer. The arrangement 
wove its way in and out of a quote from "Salt Peanuts" (Dizzy Gillespie, 
vintage 1945). 
</P>
<P>
With his shrill, abrasive alto sound, high-energy style and genial personality, 
D'Rivera kept the customers entertained. He even had jokes such as the 
reference to Miami as North Cuba. As a clarinetist he has chops to spare, 
though an entire chorus played unaccompanied on "All The Things You Are" seemed 
a little much. But at least it didn't include any quotes. The group closes 
Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER

BAVARIANS PLAY BRAHMS, BEETHOVEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Offbeat and contemporary repertory is the particular province of the Bavarian 
Radio Symphony, Sir Colin Davis, told a reporter last week. "We have a very 
large repertory, but it is not the standard one," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the ensemble from Munich, under Davis, played a standard program 
at its second appearance in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Tuesday night. The 
agenda: Brahms' Third Symphony and Beethoven's Fifth. 
</P>
<P>
After a strident, weirdly unfocused run-through of the opening Allegro, Davis 
and his Muncheners gave glowing, autumnal readings to the inner movements 
before making climactic noises in the finale. Despite moments of genuine 
musical cohesion, the impression this orchestra leaves is of provincial 
achievement. Certainly, many of the sounds emerging from brass and woodwinds do 
not meet an international standard. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's C-minor Symphony elicited a fine and successful ensemble effort. 
Davis' compelling musical perspective kept all elements in balance, contrasts 
between movements remained sharp, and the triumph of the conclusion had been 
thoroughly prepared. DANIEL CARIAGA

"If you are one of the 2 out of 3 Americans who do not smoke or drink 
excessively, your choice of diet can influence your long-term health more than 
any other action you might take." -- U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop 
</P>
<P>
Since the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health was published last 
year, news about diet and health has been prolific. Consequently, terms like 
"30%-fat-calories" and "good health" have become synonymous as this country's 
battle of the bulge rages forward. 
</P>
<P>
But the plethora of information, available through such sources as the media, 
bookstores and supermarket check-out counters, has had a chilling effect on 
consumers trying to figure out how to adhere to the recommendations in the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Many people, in fact, are having considerable trouble with the edict that fat 
in the diet must be reduced to 30% of the day's total calories. Health experts 
say that understanding scientific data and identifying foods that are rich 
sources of fat are seen as two major obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, Koop pointed out that many of the diseases plaguing this country 
have beginnings in dietary excess and imbalance. The typical American diet, it 
was reported, is too high in calories, fat, salt, sugar and alcohol and too low 
in fiber and other protective factors. He explained that since there are so 
many risk factors for disease that are uncontrollable -- heredity, age and sex 
-- Americans should make the effort to take action in the one area over which 
they have control: Diet. Still, government surveys demonstrate that consumers 
have been frustrated in their attempts to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The American Dietetic Assn., a national organization of nutrition 
professionals, hopes to change that through its National Nutrition Month 
program, slated this month. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many guidelines," said Betty Nowlin, a registered dietitian and 
media spokeswoman for ADA, "that consumers are confused about what is accurate 
information to believe. It is the role of ADA, being experts in nutrition, to 
be the leaders in providing accurate information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"People in today's fast-paced society want quick, easy, assessable information 
that they can transfer into their regular life styles," said Nowlin. "They need 
to have choices available." 
</P>
<P>
She explained that many people today still don't realize that "simple, gradual 
changes" in eating habits can produce the recommended decline in fat level, 
without neglecting good taste. Data such as the following, accumulated by the 
United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration 
supports that notion: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Public awareness of the link between dietary fat and heart disease rose 
from 45% in 1982 to 80% in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only 29% of the people surveyed knew that a product described as 
cholesterol-free could still be high in saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As few as 11% of those queried in 1984 and 1986 correctly indicated that 
hydrogenation made a fat more saturated: 27% thought it meant a fat was less 
saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Women's diets changed considerably between 1977 and 1985. They shifted to 
non-fat and low-fat milk and diet carbonated drinks, less meat and fewer eggs. 
Still, they consume too much fat -- typically from cheese and cream desserts, 
salad dressings and table fats. 
</P>
<P>
To dispel some of the myths responsible for these figures, ADA has compiled a 
variety of facts about fat -- its primary sources (especially those hidden in 
the diet) -- and offers tips on assessing fat in the diet. It is hoped that the 
information will make the 30% fat goal attainable, by encouraging people to 
consume diets that are lower in fat overall, and discourage the "good food/bad 
food" syndrome of eliminating entire food groups that are perceived as high in 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
For some people, for instance, the way to reduce fat in the diet has been to 
delete certain foods from the diet. Items that supply essential nutrients for 
proper functioning of the body are often replaced by stand-ins with the 
perceived health benefit. It is viewed as a quick and painless solution to the 
problem of nutrition in the fast-paced society of today. 
</P>
<P>
One ADA member described a client that resorted to taking fiber pills before 
meals to prevent overeating and increase her fiber intake. She recommended that 
the client eat a piece of fruit before meals instead. 
</P>
<P>
Another member recalls the client who said, "Tums give me all the calcium I 
need," failing to comprehend that low-fat dairy products are a more easily 
absorbed source of the mineral and offer other vital nutrients for little fat. 
</P>
<P>
Others still observe dieters who boast of having "only a salad" for lunch, 
without understanding that the amount of fat they consumed was just slightly 
less than if they'd eaten a hamburger with all the trimmings. One standard 
restaurant ladle of dressing can have as much as 300 calories, according to 
ADA. 
</P>
<P>
A way to avoid scenarios such as these, is to become better prepared in the 
supermarket and learn to fit favored foods into a reasonably balanced 30% diet 
plan. Reading food labels is a good place to start. Since most products list 
the amount of fat in grams on the side of the package, this is the best way to 
become familiar with the actual amount of fat in foods typically consumed. 
Then, serving sizes of these items can be adjusted to fit in a 30% diet plan, 
based on the method described below. 
</P>
<P>
The process of estimating fat in the diet is similar to the method of counting 
calories, once popular with dieters. And the procedure is simple. 
</P>
<P>
First, determine how many calories you usually eat during the course of the 
day, eliminating snacks, Nowlin said, because items such as crackers and 
desserts offer little nutrition for a high calorie price. 
</P>
<P>
Then, see how many grams of fat you are allowed for your caloric intake 
(below), based on the 30% fat level. Since most food labels tell the number of 
grams a food contains per serving, this is the most efficient way to meet the 
goal. (Translation of grams of fat to percent of fat calories is more tricky 
and won't be explained here). 
</P>
<P>
The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for energy intake (calories) is based 
upon the energy needs of people doing light work throughout the day. This 
figure may be adjusted more or less depending upon energy expenditure. In other 
words, the more you move around during the day -- whether at work or during an 
exercise program -- the more calories, and therefore fat, you are entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
For example: the RDA for calories for young to middle-aged males ranges from 
2,300 for sedentary to 3,100 or more if active. The RDA is 1,800 to 2,100 
calories for females. While there is no RDA for dieting women, it is 
recommended that they stay within the 1,200 to 1,500 calories-per-day range 
unless the diet is supervised by a physician. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve the 30% goal, a person consuming 1,200 calories per day is entitled 
to no more than 40 grams of fat. For every 300-calorie increment, add 10 grams 
of fat per day: 1,500 calories, 50 grams of fat; 1,800, 60 grams of fat; 2,100, 
70 grams of fat, etc. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, this process may seem troublesome, but keeping a mental or 
written note of the grams of fat as they accumulate is a good way to keep track 
of fat in the diet. Eventually, when you've memorized the amount of grams in 
regularly eaten foods, you can easily budget favorite foods back into the diet.

 BACK TO BASICS: THE RIGHT MIX: KEY TO MAKING GOOD CLASSIC MUFFINS IS ALL IN 
THE WRIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proper mixing is the key to making good classic muffins. If the batter has not 
been overmixed, the finished muffins will have rounded tops with 
cauliflowerlike surfaces, interiors free of tunnels and a light, moist, even 
grained texture. 
</P>
<P>
Begin muffin preparation by thoroughly blending the dry ingredients -- flour, 
sugar, baking powder and salt -- in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center of 
this mixture and set the bowl aside. Then in a smaller bowl, mix the liquid 
ingredients -- egg, milk, melted fat or oil and other seasonings -- until 
well-combined. 
</P>
<P>
Pour the liquid ingredients all at once into the well in the dry ingredients 
(Step 1) and stir just enough to moisten the flour mixture -- 12 to 15 circular 
stirs with a spoon or rubber spatula. The batter should still be lumpy (Step 
2), but not have any areas with dry flour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Shape Them Up 
</P>
<P>
Scoop or spoon the batter into greased or paper-lined muffins cups (Step 3), 
filling 2/3 to 3/4 full, unless directed otherwise in the recipe. To eliminate 
misshapen or lopsided muffins, a single scoop or spoonful of batter should be 
used for each muffin, rather than adding batter a bit at a time. Fill any empty 
muffin cups with water to prevent the pan from warping during baking. 
</P>
<P>
Oven temperatures of 400 to 425 degrees permit the muffins to bake through to 
the center quickly, before the outside burns or dries out. Remove from the oven 
when the muffins are golden brown, spring back when pressed lightly or when a 
wood pick inserted in the middle comes out clean (Step 4). 
</P>
<P>
Muffins are meant to be served immediately; they do not retain their freshness 
very long. If they must be stored, remove from the pan and cool, then wrap 
carefully and freeze. Reheat frozen muffins, wrapped in foil, at 350 degrees 15 
to 20 minutes, or until heated through. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overmixing Leads to Toughness 
</P>
<P>
If classic muffins are overmixed, their texture changes from bread to cakelike 
and becomes tough. Tops are smooth and peaked and interiors are full of 
tunnels. Certain muffins, however, are intended to be rich and have a texture 
like cake. These are high in sugar and shortening and are prepared by another 
mixing method similar to cakes. Such batters can withstand more mixing and need 
to be baked at lower temperatures -- 350 to 375 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Any muffin recipe may be baked in the now-popular oversized form. The 
larger-size muffin pans are available in many houseware departments and 
cookware stores. Some recipes may need an adjustment in baking time, but this 
recipe for Lemon Muffins was developed using a muffin pan with depressions 3 
1/4 inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
LEMON MUFFINS 
</P>
<P>
1 3/4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder and salt in medium mixing bowl. 
Beat egg lightly in small bowl. Stir in milk, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, lemon 
juice and oil. 
</P>
<P>
Add liquid to flour mixture, stirring just until moistened. Fill greased muffin 
cups 2/3 full. 
</P>
<P>
Combine remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest. Sprinkle 
over tops of muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 400 degrees 20 minutes. Makes about 6 large muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If desired, 3 tablespoons decorator sugar may be substituted for 
granulated sugar in topping. Decorator sugar is coarser in texture and may be 
purchased at cake-decorating supply stores.

In the last four years, the health-claims issue has generated a constant debate 
between science and business. Scientists worry about food companies' getting 
into the health business and marketers worry about health experts' getting into 
the food business. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the controversy is the extent to which the government should 
get involved. Here's what's happened so far: 
</P>
<P>
October 1984: Kellogg's breaks an 82-year prohibition against advertising 
health claims on food labels by launching a national ad campaign for its 
All-Bran cereal. The promotion, based on the value of high-fiber diets in 
reducing the risks of certain forms of cancer, is particularly controversial 
because the National Cancer Institute, a government agency, helped devise it. 
</P>
<P>
August 1987: The Food and Drug Administration proposes allowing health claims 
on food labels. The plan is vague and ambiguous, giving food companies a lot of 
latitude. While it's pending, the proposal permits manufacturers to make 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1987: Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Government 
Operations subcommittee that oversees FDA, charges that the agency's proposal 
had been watered down by political appointees in the Office of Management and 
Budget, where the document was reviewed before its release. Weiss says that the 
proposal "strongly reflects the intervention of OMB ideologues who seek 
unregulated market entry of food products bearing disease-specific health 
claims." 
</P>
<P>
January, 1988: Public comment on the proposal ends. The majority of comments 
oppose it or parts of it. 
</P>
<P>
September, 1988: FDA reviews the comments and sends an amended, more 
restrictive final rule to OMB. OMB receives an indefinite extension to respond. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1988: Manufacturers continue to make health claims on food labels.

CULINARY SOS: PRIME RIB HASH THAT'S IDEAL FOR BRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: At the Jolly Roger in Rolling Hills Estates I tasted a prime rib hash 
that was so good. If you could get them to share their recipe, I'm sure many of 
us would appreciate it. They serve it as a special on their Sunday breakfast 
menu. -- ELIZABETH 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ELIZABETH: It's a terrific recipe to keep in mind whenever you have 
leftover prime rib and cooked potatoes from a feast the night before. Ideally, 
drippings from roasted meat should be used for flavoring the meat and potatoes, 
however, if none is left, you can use commercial meat glaze or brown cooking 
sauce. The rehash is a satisfying meal, especially for Sunday brunch, when most 
of us have more time to spend in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
JOLLY ROGER 
</P>
<P>
PRIME RIB HASH 
</P>
<P>
1 pound potatoes, cooked and diced 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound cooked and diced prime rib 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons au jus concentrate or drippings, meat glaze or brown cooking 
sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
Mix potatoes, prime rib, drippings, salt and garlic in skillet heated with oil. 
Saute until heated through. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: My husband and I have just returned from Florida where we enjoyed Key 
Lime Pie at several restaurants. I would like to try making one, but so far, 
have been unable to find a recipe in any of my cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CHARLENE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CHARLENE: Here's a Key Lime Pie that uses the small Key or Mexican limes, 
which are sometimes available in markets. If you can find them, use the largest 
available, but if you can't find them, any lime will do. However, the taste 
will be different compared to a true Key Lime Pie. And while you're at it, you 
might want to remember that lemon can be substituted for lime for variety. 
</P>
<P>
KEY LIME PIE 
</P>
<P>
6 eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk (do not substitute evaporated) 
</P>
<P>
Juice of 7 large Key limes or Mexican limes, about 1/2 cup 
</P>
<P>
1 baked (9-inch) pie shell 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg yolks lightly, then blend in condensed milk. Add lime juice and blend 
well. Turn into pie shell and bake at 350 degrees 10 to 15 minutes to heat and 
thicken filling slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until stiff. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 
tablespoon at time. Continue to beat until very stiff. Swirl meringue onto pie, 
making sure to seal all around edge of pie. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 400 degrees 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees and bake 15 minutes 
or until meringue is pale tan. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I lost my recipe for Bourbon Baked Beans made with canned beans and 
instant coffee. My family loved them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- VIRGINIA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR VIRGINIA: We love them too. You can use any spirits you want -- bourbon, 
sherry or rum. 
</P>
<P>
BOURBON BAKED 
</P>
<P>
BEANS 
</P>
<P>
1 (1-pound 12-ounce) can baked beans 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup bourbon, sherry or rum 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon instant coffee powder 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon prepared mustard 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
Combine beans, bourbon, brown sugar, coffee powder, mustard and lemon juice. 
Turn into individual bean pots or casseroles. Bake at 350 degrees 40 to 45 
minutes. Makes 4 servings.

 LET'S EAT OUT: AT GRANDIA, DINNER IS WORTH THE WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I know, I know. You've already heard about Grandia Palace from me. But that was 
long ago; things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Grandia Palace in Hollywood was a bargain the moment it opened its doors, 
with its good fish dishes at prices that would make you happy all the way to 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
But now that it's been around some -- one, two years? -- a sort of seasoning 
and curing has turned it into an even greater bargain. 
</P>
<P>
What you have now is a restaurant not only with good, clean food (chiefly fish 
with strong Greek overtones) and ridiculously low prices, but an ambiance that 
is more cheerful than Aunt Jenny's kitchen and entertainment that is clearly a 
big, big bonus to any restaurant trying to survive these days. 
</P>
<P>
You get singing-dancing waiters and waitresses, an accomplished guitarist 
strumming in place (not roving), a proprietor who makes you feel at home, a 
cook in the kitchen who can do Greek cooking as well as he does his native 
Majorcan cooking (the paella was a striking example of good Spanish home 
cooking), and Apollo, Diane and Socrates (statues) peering at you from behind 
blooming azalea plants wherever in the room you may be. On weekends, customers 
join in the entertainment, much as they do at the Japanese bars. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, the giant-size replica of Apollo standing like an X-rated 
advertisement for a bathhouse smack inside the dining room, where you can't 
miss him, is still around, but with an anatomical alteration that pains me in 
more than one way. 
</P>
<P>
And, no, the crummy door jambs were never fixed, even though new splendid doors 
have replaced the old boards that passed for doors in the past. "Acropolis was 
never finished, either," said Peter Sargologos, the owner. He has a point. 
</P>
<P>
The food has changed somewhat, too, now that Sargologos decided to beef up the 
Greek portion of the menu by popular demand. "I never intended it to be a Greek 
restaurant, just seafood, but people want it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? You have some truly fine Greek tiropita and spanokopita (savory 
filo pastries). The avgolemono (lemon-flavored chicken noodle soup) would be 
great anytime, particularly on a day when you're feeling the need for a lift. 
There is no Greek salad anywhere else in the city that I know of that is better 
than the one Sargologos serves. It's a meal, brimming with the freshest of 
fresh vegetables, good ripe tomatoes, superb Greek cheese from Epirus and 
calamata olives that are plump and juicy. If you want chicken added to the dish 
for a main-course meal, you get it without further ado. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek dishes are listed separately, but some, such as meze (appetizers), 
also appear with other non-Greek appetizers. Keftedakia (meat balls), saganaki 
(fried cheese) taramosalata (red roe caviar dip) and Greek eggplant salad are 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to stick to Greek food, try any of the lamb dishes served, 
especially if they've been freshly made. The lamb youvetsi, fricassee, leg of 
lamb and lamb with eggplant are good most of the time. I've had somewhat 
dried-out leg of lamb at times, but not often. The moussaka and pastichio are 
wonderful when freshly made, too, so ask first. The Greek makaronada (macaroni 
with meat) is a double meal. Be prepared for toting as you leave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Styles 
</P>
<P>
The remaining menu is a mixed bag of seafood, Continental, vegetarian, 
south-of-the-border and European dishes. A little too much of everything is 
bothersome, but Sargologos refuses to narrow things down. "People like them," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
So you'll find vegetarian fettuccine Alfredo, pizza (with dried tomatoes, pine 
nuts, cashews, caseri cheese, almonds, artichokes and Alfredo sauce), passion 
fruit with cottage cheese, stuffed pepper a la Greque among the vegetarian 
dishes. There are burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos and fajitas from south 
of the border, and from Europe, pepperoni pizza, Spanish paella for two, 
ravioli with sauce Bolognese and fettuccine with seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Among continental dishes, you can have grilled chops, chicken, veal, New York 
steak, shish kebab (beef, chicken and fish) plus ground steak. Combination 
plates are also available, if you want to mix and match. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, you can virtually order any food anyway you desire it cooked. 
Sargologos will comply. The seafood section, for instance, simply lists the 
type of fish available (a giant lobster tail at $35 for a whole and $16.85 for 
a half included). The fish, by the way, comes from Sargologos' fish store 
across the street, which also contains a seafood cafe. Dirt cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Just tell the waiter how you want the fish cooked -- grilled, broiled or 
poached. All entrees come with soup or salad. At prices ranging from $6.95 for 
seafood plaki or $12.95 for steak and shrimp combo plate and $11.95 for a huge 
main course salad, you can't possibly go wrong. The most expensive item on the 
menu sans lobster and fresh crab is $16.95 for bouillabaisse for two. 
</P>
<P>
And we haven't even gotten to the piece de resistence -- the singing-dancing 
help -- who vary from time to time, depending on who lasts the grueling pace. 
After all, your waiter is balancing plates one moment and is suddenly out on 
the dance floor doing a hopa Greek dance with Nureyev proficiency, if not 
grace. The next time you look up, he's at the microphone wailing "I want you, I 
need you, I love you," with the kind of feeling that would make Elvis seem like 
Whistler's mother. Hokey, never serious, but just the right kind of silliness 
that makes an evening out fun. 
</P>
<P>
Which bring us to one major flaw of the restaurant. The wait. Service, while 
charming and bright, willing and able, is still slow and somewhat forgetful. 
Who can blame the overqualified waiters? Besides, who cares, if your intention 
is to be entertained. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, the noise level has not diminished. It's even bolder and more bouncy 
now that there is music and dance to reverberate against the marble and glass. 
If you consider noisiness a flaw, forget Grandia. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to try the rice pudding if it's fresh. Don't bother, if it's not. 
The pudding is the typical Greek version that is slightly more creamy and runny 
than firm, baked American rice pudding. The custard flan is good, too. There is 
baklava (nut-filled filo pastry) and galactobureko (Greek baked custard filled 
pastry). Excellent. 
</P>
<P>
So what else do you want? An early-bird menu? You've got it, at prices several 
dollars less than the regular menu. Instead of $6.95 for Greek salad you pay 
$4.95. New York steak is $8.95 and roast lamb $7.95. All with soup or salad, 
bread and butter. What you don't get with the early-hour menu is the 
entertainment. But who cares if all you want to do is eat? 
</P>
<P>

p.m. for lunch; 5 to 11 p.m. for dinner. Live Greek music daily except Tuesday

 HINTS FROM HELOISE: VEGETABLE OIL IS GOOD DIETER'S SUBSTITUTE FOR BUTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I am on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet and have had to give up 
all my favorite desserts because of the eggs, butter or shortening used in 
cakes, pies and muffins. 
</P>
<P>
I recently read that I can substitute two egg whites for each yolk. What I 
would like to know is can I substitute oil for butter or shortening? 
</P>
<P>
 -- P.C., New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR P.C.: Yes, you can substitute vegetable oil for butter, margarine or 
shortening. You will need to use one-third less vegetable oil. For instance, 
substitute two teaspoons of vegetable oil for one tablespoon of solid 
shortening. There are a few recipes that you may have to experiment with to get 
the best results. A good vegetable oil is your best bet for low cholesterol, 
but as you know, oil is not low in fat. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, when substituting two egg whites for a yolk in a recipe, you may 
also add one to three teaspoons of vegetable oil for every yolk you omit to 
give the recipe a better texture. 
</P>
<P>
A big hug to you for watching out for your health. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Here's how to prepare a complete salad, including dressing, in 
advance without having it become soggy. 
</P>
<P>
Pour the desired dressing in the bottom of the salad bowl, layer in tomatoes 
and vegetables. Last, add the lettuce or spinach leaves. Place prepared salad 
in the refrigerator and toss right before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GLENN SCHMIDT, San Antonio, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Each week, it seems a new microwave product comes out, designed 
for preparation in the disposable-type tray. As I use each one at home I wash 
the tray and store it for later use. 
</P>
<P>
We have a microwave at work in the lunch room. When I take leftovers for lunch 
I pack them in various trays, seal them with plastic wrap and heat them as is 
on my lunch break. Afterwards, I just throw them away and there is no clean-up 
or toting dirty dishes home to be washed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DIANE FRENCH, Ft. Madison, Iowa 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Do you or any of your readers know how to clean the window in an 
oven door? I have tried almost everything, but the window is still dirty! 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. HAROLD DOUGAL, Scott, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MRS. DOUGAL: Here is a solution that one of our readers has used for the 
last 15 years with great results. 
</P>
<P>
Wipe the glass window down with ammonia and let this set for a few minutes. 
Take a plastic ice scraper that is used to remove ice from automobile 
windshields and scrape away the goop from the oven window. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I make a batch of my family's favorite chocolate-chip 
cookies, I usually make about 25 dozen. In most cases this would take a long 
time, but I found a way that has proved to be time-saving. 
</P>
<P>
I use a large melon-ball maker to scoop the cookie dough onto the cookie 
sheets. All the cookies come out the same size and are just right for 
grandchildren, at weddings and parties. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. RUTH PEACE, Hillsville, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: You once gave instructions on how to make dish-washing scrubbers 
from nylon netting. Could you please repeat these instructions? 
</P>
<P>
 -- PEGGY HATT, Kearney, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR PEGGY: Sure. First of all, purchase one-half yard (72 inches wide) of 
nylon net at your local fabric store. Next, cut three (6-inch wide) strips 
across the width of the nylon net. Place these strips one on top of the other 
and match the edges. Baste down the middle using sturdy thread or yarn and a 
long basting stitch. Tie the two ends of thread together. Wrap the remaining 
thread around the middle once, tie and cut off the excess. 
</P>
<P>
Pull one layer of nylon net at a time toward the center where the thread is 
tied until you have a round fluffy ball of nylon net. 
</P>
<P>
These are so simple to make and are wonderful for the kitchen, bathroom or 
almost anywhere where there is scrubbing to be done. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have a problem. I inherited a lot of canned goods that had been 
accumulated over the years. Is there some way to tell the dates on canned 
goods? We have opened some and found the contents no good. Surely, modern 
companies can put legible, intelligible dates on products. 
</P>
<P>
Please help. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. FRANCES JOHNSTON, Garland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MRS. JOHNSTON: First of all, throw all those canned goods away 
immediately. If they have been accumulated over the years, they are definitely 
not worth taking a chance with. Canned goods, under the right conditions, can 
be stored for up to a year, or longer depending on the contents. 
</P>
<P>
We hope canned food manufacturers will, one day, put legible code dates on all 
canned food products. This way we will be able to keep better track of how long 
they have been sitting on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I found a 12-inch bottle brush to be an ideal cleaning tool for 
the lint trap in my clothes dryer. The long handle and curved end also may be 
used to clear lint from under or surrounding the trap. Using it has also saved 
many a fingertip and fingernail. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JANE S. PETERS, Camp Hill, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,

received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.

DOC GREEN, 54; SINGER WITH THE DRIFTERS OF 1950S AND '60S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doc Green, a baritone member of the 1950s and '60s rock group the Drifters, has 
died of cancer at his home in New York, family members said Monday. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
Green began singing on Harlem street corners as a youngster and joined the 
group sometime after it was formed in the mid-1950s. The singers, whose hits 
were to include "There Goes My Baby," "Sweets for My Sweet," "Under the 
Boardwalk," and "Up on the Roof," initially called themselves Clyde McPhatter 
and the Drifters during the late 1950s. The name was later shortened to the 
Drifters. According to the anthology "Who's Who in Rock," the name was used 
because so many of the members "drifted" back and forth to other groups. 
</P>
<P>
The original group broke up in the late 1960s, although a variety of acts 
continued to use the name. 
</P>
<P>
His family said Green continued working as a singer with other groups, 
including, most recently, Vito and the Salutations. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who died Friday, is survived by his wife and mother, four sons, four 
daughters and five grandchildren.

It was like old times at USC the other day, when the student body elections 
were invalidated amid suspicions of Chicago-style ballot-box-stuffing and other 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
USC, of course, is the school that hatched such Watergate figures as Ronald 
Ziegler, Dwight L. Chapin, Gordon C. Strachan and Donald H. Segretti. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Davis, the current Daily Trojan editor, recalled that in the early 1970s 
one student body president was accused of holding meetings of his Supreme Court 
in the middle of the night in an effort to force members to resign. He then 
allegedly appointed several friends to the court -- and resumed daytime 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
That scandal led to the temporary suspension of student government altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year at USC is a Watergate," remarked Frederic Coonradt, a retired USC 
journalism professor. 
</P>
<P>
Hijinks over the years have included the theft of Daily Trojans that carried 
election endorsements, the spread of manure around polling places to keep women 
away, the tampering of election machinery and the promise of one rebel 
candidate to abolish student government. The rebel won and changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Cohen, now a Hollywood writer, parodied the corruption in his run for the 
student body presidency at USC. He lost despite the fact that his platform 
endorsed pollution "in hopes of getting campaign contributions from Union Oil 
(now Unocal) as well as General Motors." 
</P>

They were dressed in identical black outfits when they showed up at the 
recruiting station. And soon the 17-year-old triplets will be wearing identical 
green outfits on weekends. San Fernando High School students Lorena, Lourdes 
and Lupe Rodriguez enlisted in the California Army National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"They plan to use the G.I. Bill to help finance their educations," Sgt. Sharon 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited," said Lupe Rodriguez, who, being the eldest by 10 minutes, 
sometimes speaks for the others. 
</P>
<P>
Authorized biographies are supposed to treat their subjects gently. So how do 
you figure this back-handed compliment in "Tom Bradley -- The Impossible 
Dream," by J. Gregory Payne and Scott C. Ratzan? On page 337, the writers say 
that one of the mayor's campaign slogans was "Tom Bradley doesn't make a lot of 
sense, he just gets things done." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was a mistake. The writers meant to say noise instead of sense. 
</P>
<P>
Nice sense of history on the part of Universal Studios, advertising its new 
earthquake exhibit on a billboard on Philadelphia Street in Whittier, just a 
few blocks from the buildings that were devastated by a real-life quake in 
October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Apples may be verboten, along with grapes. But the California Raisins' video, 
featuring the dried-up rockers of the television commercials, has just hit the 
stores here.

MANDELA AND SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How can we now justify calling for total economic sanctions and total 
disinvestment in light of "South Africa's Shame" (editorial, Feb. 21)? Francis 
Wilson and Mamphela Ramphele's report claims there are no quick solutions, 
including economic sanctions, through which the South African government would 
either voluntarily or forcibly be persuaded into negotiating away its position 
of power. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the report adds that much can be done to prepare for a more 
constructive future. It challenges people to get on with those steps now. The 
shape of South African society in the future will depend critically on the 
foundation now laid. How can a strong foundation be laid by strangling the very 
economy that must assist in laying that foundation? Perhaps it is time to 
re-evaluate the call for total economic sanctions and disinvestment from South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
I lived in Zimbabwe the last three years, lecturing in the College of 
Agriculture at the University of Zimbabwe. It became apparent to me that the 
major concerns of the government, eight years after independence, were 
employment, education and health. This country is now going through a stage of 
development that South Africa may well face in the future. There is a race 
against time because of the enormous population growth. It has been estimated 
that over 50% of the black population in both countries is under 15 years of 
age. Surely, the South African children will also need and demand better 
opportunities for employment, education and health. How can these be created 
without some investment in carefully targeted impact programs in these sectors? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we must not overlook the interdependence among countries in southern 
Africa. Peace and stability in South Africa is interwoven with peace and 
stability in southern Africa. We should not let this window of opportunity pass 
for stabilization in the region. To facilitate the cause of justice in South 
Africa it would, therefore, seem imperative to create opportunities through 
selective investments. Clearly, we must re-evaluate the call for total economic 
sanctions and total disinvestment.

OVERPOPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newspapers give us history in small daily doses nearly as ephemeral as the 
spoken news on radio and TV, but it is printed news and can be assembled into a 
kind of graph showing trends in the fears and interests of readers over time. 
News stories change as we change. 
</P>
<P>
The news we read today is filled with new things; the many kinds of 
environmental pollution, mass starvation, and the formation of a permanent 
world population of refugees and homeless people. Even if you and I escape 
industrial poisoning for the moment and don't have to step around bloated 
bellies, we are beginning to realize that no place on Earth is safe forever in 
our highly interconnected modern world. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the kind of news we used to read, for today there is a missing 
ingredient, the sense of hope for improvement that went with bad news even 
during the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Something else is missing from the hail of disaster stories that now pelt 
readers; a recognition of the underlying, basic cause of shattered societies 
and poisoned air: overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
We are twice as numerous in the world today as when I was 60 years younger and 
it is this fact, numbers alone, that we must talk about, read about in 
newspapers, and finally do something about. Survival and population control and 
international action will fill tomorrow's newspapers.

CALIFORNIA: FISCAL GRIDLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOTE: In a recent letter to The Times, Gov. George Deukmejian complained that 
this newspaper frequently proposes new state programs without saying where it 
would get the money to pay for them. On Wednesday, this column outlined the 
state's budget problems in general. Today, The Times explains how the state 
came to find itself in such fiscal straits and what to do about them. Tomorrow, 
The Times will propose specific additions to the governor's 1989-90 budget and 
the tax increases that would pay for those additions. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of life in California is crumbling in ways that every citizen can 
see -- traffic gridlock on deteriorating highways, inadequate growth 
management, an education system at capacity and potential chronic water 
shortages, to name a few. Turning that trend around will take money and firm 
direction from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is not a lack of revenues," Governor Deukmejian wrote in a letter 
to The Times, published Wednesday, in which he challenged the argument that 
California cannot effectively deal with future growth without additional tax 
income. Low taxes have encouraged economic growth and this, in turn, produces 
more state tax revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But California's fiscal structure is not providing the revenue the state needs, 
either to sustain many vital services at existing levels or to build the public 
works system the state must have to accommodate and manage California's growth. 
Increasingly, the California business community is concerned that the failure 
of the state to maintain and expand its transportation system, schools and 
other public works will jeopardize the state's economic vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that California's system of taxation has been restricted 
over the past 11 years, primarily by initiative petition measures written into 
law by the voters. Deukmejian has offered tentative support for reform of the 
Gann spending limits, but opposes any general tax increase. He would accede to 
higher gasoline taxes only if approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
More transportation revenue is California's most urgent priority. Five years 
ago, the Governor's Task Force on Infrastructure Review projected a 10-year 
public works deficit of more than $50 billion, including $15 billion for 
highways. Five years later, California is spending less ontransportation than 
any other state as a proportion of personal income. The state gasoline tax,the 
principal source of highway construction funds, remains unchanged at 9 cents 
per gallon. The highway project gap has grown to $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The gas tax is the most obvious example of how California's revenue system is 
failing to keep up with need. But it is only a part of a dramatically changed 
structure that has granted Californians $115 billion in direct tax benefits 
since 1978, according to the California Taxpayers' Assn., a business-supported 
group. The tax revolt triggered by the Proposition 13 property tax rollback of 
1978 has produced radical change throughout the tax system. Proposition 13 was 
followed by voter initiatives that set strict spending limits on state and 
local government (Proposition 4, theGann initiative of 1979), eliminated the 
state inheritance tax and permanently indexed the personal income tax for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 13, the Legislature can increase taxes only by a two-thirds 
vote, something that is almost impossible to achieve. Local tax increases can 
be raised only by a vote of the people. State budgeting was further constrained 
by last fall's Proposition 98 that sets aside 40% of the state budget for 
public education. 
</P>
<P>
State officials increasingly are turning to bond financing because bond funds 
are not counted against the Gann spending limits and need only a majority vote 
to pass. In 1988, $5.5 billion in bond funds were approved, raising the state 
debt to $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the debt level is not near a danger point, and California's high credit 
rating remains intact. The major problem is that the state has no process for 
planning and budgeting capital construction needs. Bond issues get on the 
ballot on the basis of political appeal, not in relation to long-term 
priorities. The Legislature passed a bill last year to begin such a planning 
process, but it was vetoed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 produced other distortions, such as the creation of a new layer 
of special tax districts to raise revenue that used to come out of general 
government funds. Counties have been squeezed from both sides -- a loss of 
property tax revenue and an increase in responsibilitydelegated to them by the 
Legislature but not accompanied by enough money to finance the programs. 
</P>
<P>
Money alone will not make everything right. California needs to come together 
as it did in the 1950s and 1960s to assess its problems and to mobilize the 
energy, political leadership and finances required to overcome them. But the 
"creative solutions" that have evolved in the post-Proposition 13 era -- 
devices such as developer fees to finance public facilities as a way of getting 
around the law -- will not solve California's problems, either. These are 
indirect taxes thatfall inequitably on different groups of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, the Gann limits should be based on a more realistic formula of 
inflation and population gain than at present so they accurately reflect the 
growing demands on government. And one way to eliminate some of the inequities 
created by Proposition 13 is to create a split assessment roll so that 
businesses can be taxed at a somewhat higher rate than homeowners. Since 1978, 
homes have carried an increasingly larger share of the property tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
The first need is for a gasoline tax increase that will permit the development 
of an integrated transportation plan for the 21st Century. Second, the state 
must have some additional general revenue to maintain programs such as health 
care and education. Then, California leaders must begin untangling the fiscal 
pretzel that is paralyzing government. To deal with its problems, California 
must return to a rational form of budgeting on the basis of priorities rather 
than the arbitrary dictates of poorly conceived initiative measures. 
</P>
<P>
The new tax money would not go for frills, nor would it jeopardize the state's 
economic vitality. It is the very necessary investment that California must 
have if the state is to build a bright future.

GLOBAL ROLE DEMANDS A 15-CARRIER NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLISLE A. H. TROST, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost is chief of naval operations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy aircraft-carrier battle group is the most needed and most worked asset 
in our nation's military arsenal. Yet despite the historically proven value of 
these ships, defense critics continue to make annual assaults on these 
backbones of our national and maritime strategy. Their goal apparently is a 
reduction of battle groups from the present number of 15. But to accomplish 
such a reduction would be a tragic mistake. For our Navy to meet its global 
peacetime requirements at a prudent level of risk to our country, 15 is the 
minimum number we can deploy. (In a global conflict, we would need 20 such 
battle groups, a figure continually validated by regional military commanders 
and through in-depth studies by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.) 
</P>
<P>
Any discussion of carrier battle groups -- in fact, any discussion of the Navy 
-- must be undertaken with an understanding of the geopolitical framework of 
our country. As a maritime nation, our economic survival is dependent on the 
seas. Our vital interests are expressed in a web of more than 40 treaty 
relationships with binding coalitions for mutual defense. These relationships, 
together with the commercial dependencies that support our economy, shape our 
national security objectives. Stated simply, global commitments set the 
environment in which we live, work and prosper. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Soviet threat has not abated, despite the rhetoric of a 
brilliant public-relations campaign by Moscow. Soviet military spending 
continues to absorb a disproportionate amount of its gross national product. 
The growing Soviet navy is clearly offense-oriented with global reach. New and 
very capable warships of every type continue to be produced. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, low-intensity conflicts in the Third World provide a global 
threat from terrorists and other fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
If we intend to secure our national- security interests, freedom of the seas is 
still a primary requisite. This means possessing a Navy deployed in strategic 
regions of the globe where it is needed to deter war and, if that fails, to 
respond with force. 
</P>
<P>
No Administration, regardless of political persuasion, has been able to solve 
this protection problem with other means of force. A Navy operating in regional 
waters near potential conflict provides an advantage that cannot be 
approximated by forces based in the United States, regardless of how ready they 
may be. 
</P>
<P>
If we are not going to have a permanent presence based overseas with our 
closest allies, then the only practical means of applying adequate force to a 
crisis and promoting regional stability beyond our own borders is to have that 
presence on station in international waters and airspace. 
</P>
<P>
Electronically integrated, the carrier battle group -- its complement of 80 to 
90 multimission aircraft and accompanying cruisers, destroyers and submarines 
-- provides a four-dimensional warfare capability. At a time when the battle 
sphere has expanded from the radar horizon to more than 1,000 miles, the 
carrier battle group provides a capability unmatched by any other military 
component inexistence. 
</P>
<P>
Highly mobile and flexible, the battle group sends a strong political signal to 
an adversary. If need be, it can take complete control of an area. But if 
military power is not required and a political situation is stabilized, the 
battle group can simply steam away with no signals of retreat or weakness. 
</P>
<P>
But why 15 carrier groups? Because a lesser number presents us with two 
unacceptable results: The first is that we will be forced to abdicate some 
global commitments, which would lead to diminished influence throughout an 
increasingly economically interdependent, multipolar and militarized world. 
</P>
<P>
And because U.S. commitments will not decline, we cannot afford to take the 
strategic risk of a reduced carrier force structure. To meet our level of 
commitments with fewer forces would result in each ship and aircraft squadron 
having to be under way more, be gone from home longer and work harder. During 
the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, the aircraft carrier Eisenhower battle 
group was deployed for 254 days with only five days in port. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting our commitments with a smaller carrier force will result in cost 
increases, not savings. Overhaul and maintenance costs would go up, as we saw 
in the Vietnam era. Retention would go down, just as we saw in the 1970s when 
new commitments were added without an increase in carrier numbers. We ran 
sailors and their families into the ground and paid for it. So many chose to 
leave the Navy then that we were left with quantifiably lower levels of 
readiness -- and a much-reduced level of confidence. This represents an 
institutional risk we cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
At our nation's founding, Congress mandated that the Navy protect us and and 
ensure our survival and prosperity. Congress recognized our country as being 
maritime-dependent, and that fact has not changed.

OPTIONS ISRAEL WILL ALLOW FAIL THE WORKABILITY TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH ALPHER, Joseph Alpher is deputy head of the Jaffee Center for 
Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, and co-editor of the center's 
recently published reports The West Bank and Gaza: Israel's Options for Peace 
and Israel, the West Bank and Gaza: Toward a Solution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEL AVIV 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any Israeli politician worth his salt has to propose his very own option -- 
sometimes two -- for a solution to the Palestinian issue. During the first week 
in March, for example, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir suggested comprehensive 
autonomy on one day, then promised annexation on the next; Labor's Shimon Peres 
called for federation, and another prominent Labor minister suggested 
unilateral withdrawal from Gaza for a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new Administration in Washington was assuring Israel that it 
would not support a Palestinian state solution; President Bush is on record 
supporting a Jordanian-Palestinian federation. And Yasser Arafat was 
captivating his many visitors in Tunis with detailed descriptions of 
Japanese-designed tunnels to link the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the two 
parts of the state he proposes. 
</P>
<P>
These and many additional "options" have in common one crucial drawback: Those 
who propose them appear to have made no serious effort to investigate their 
strategic ramifications for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
That was the purpose of a comprehensive study by the Jaffee Center for 
Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. A team of more than 20 generals, 
professors, researchers and former government ministers -- a membership whose 
diverse views represent around 75% of Israeli public opinion -- labored for 
eight months to produce detailed scenarios of the consequences for Israel of 
adopting any of the options that are currently on the agenda. We asked 
ourselves what the ramification for Israel would be if an Israeli government 
were to seek to implement a given option -- what might we expect interms of war 
risks, economic, demographic and geographic effects, the American and Soviet 
reactions, the danger of internal conflict among Israeli leftists and 
rightists, the reaction of Israel's own Arab sector (18% of its population) and 
of the Arab world and the Palestinians? 
</P>
<P>
We pondered whether an attempt by a rightist government to deport hundreds of 
thousands of Palestinians might not generate a near-war between Israeli 
leftists and rightists. And we assessed the reaction of Israeli soldiers upon 
receiving orders to remove by force tens of thousands of Israeli settlers from 
territory destined for a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
The results of our investigation are at once frightening and depressing: All of 
Israel's current options are either not feasible or not advisable. 
</P>
<P>
Annexation would catalyze war, isolation and civil strife; unilateral 
withdrawal would be perceived as weakness, and would produce an instant 
irredentist Palestinian state that owed Israel nothing in return; open-ended 
autonomy would find no Palestinians willing to collaborate; a 
Jordanian-Palestinian federation is no longer on Jordan's agenda (it never was 
on the Palestinians'), and a Palestinian state that came into being without 
extensive transition arrangements could catalyze war, terrorism and Israeli 
domestic strife. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, we concluded, remains stuck in a status quo that threatens escalating 
war risks, growing loss of American support and rising domestic discontent. Yet 
our leaders seem alarmingly incapable of taking bold new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Our own ideas for a more realistic peace process left most of the politicians 
predictably cold. The Likud and many in Labor did not like our call for the 
government to talk directly with PLO-approved Palestinians, or our suggestion 
that the eventual emergence of a demilitarized Palestinian state, surrounded by 
Arab states at peace with Israel, need not threaten Israel strategically. Labor 
continues to long for a Jordanian solution, while many on the left complain 
that the 10- to 15-year transition period that we propose is unrealistic. 
Palestinians argued that our demands on them -- demilitarization, border 
alterations, rehabilitating the refugees to prove they have renounced their 
claim to "return" to Israel -- were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians were hardly expected to react otherwise to this academic 
intrusion into policy-making. Perhaps, with time, some of our ideas will filter 
through. But on a deeper level we feel that we have already provided everyone 
concerned with a better yardstick with which to measure proposals for a 
Palestinian settlement -- a model for assessing their strategic ramifications 
for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled Israeli breadwinner doing his two-month reserve stint in Nablus, 
concerned American Jews, Palestinian Arabs -- all can now hold their leaders to 
a higher standard. The politicians in Jerusalem, Washington and Tunis may not 
like this either. But perhaps it will now be a little harder for them to ignore 
the demand for more creative and responsible thinking on the Palestinian issue.

PEOPLE: EINHORN TO QUIT SEC POST, JOIN DISCOUNT BROKERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irving M. Einhorn told the Securities and Exchange Commission staff in Los 
Angeles on Wednesday that he is leaving his post as the regulator's regional 
administrator to join a discount brokerage as a senior executive and partner. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the agency on May 12, he will become executive vice president and 
general counsel of Pacific Brokerage Services, a Los Angeles-based brokerage 
operation and member of the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Einhorn, 47, has spent 17 years with the SEC, beginning as a staff attorney in 
Chicago and working at the agency's headquarters in Washington. Since March, 
1984, he has run the Los Angeles regional office and has been widely credited 
with upgrading the image and effectiveness of the agency here. 
</P>
<P>
"Working for the SEC is the only job I've had since I graduated from law 
school, but this is a super opportunity and I decided to take the plunge," 
Einhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Brokerage has its headquarters in the same Wilshire Boulevard building 
that houses the SEC, and Einhorn, known for his wit, joked, "I just didn't want 
to give up my parking spot." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he will give up the parking slot to a new regional administrator. 
Einhorn said he has begun recruiting to fill the post and hopes that his 
successor will have a strong background in litigation and prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC in Los Angeles is playing a central role in a new federal effort to 
crack down on stock fraud and insider trading on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Wallace, president, chief executive and founder of Pacific Brokerage, 
said Einhorn will help him run the firm, which has offices in New York, 
Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco and Boca Raton, Fla., in addition to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting Irv Einhorn is a major coup for us," said Wallace, who first met 
Einhorn when Pacific Brokerage moved into the building on Wilshire. DOUGLAS

DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: A TRIBUTE TO MSGR. EAGEN AND SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Nelson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1988, Dr. Robert Runcie, archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual leader of 
the Church of England, awarded a trophy to the St. Vincent de Paul-Joan Kroc 
Center that named it the premier shelter on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
That trophy was on display Saturday in the downtown Marriott's San Diego 
Ballroom, but the spotlight shone even brighter on Msgr. I. Brent Eagen, named 
"A Man for All Seasons" by both the organizers of the fund-raiser to benefit 
St. Vincent and the 800 guests who gathered to applaud the man who is known 
fondly by many as "the Silver Fox." Since 1968, Eagen has juggled 
responsibilities as chancellor of the Catholic Diocese of San Diego, pastor of 
the Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcala and chaplain of the San Diego 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
The tribute marked a change in direction for the annual St. Vincent benefit, 
which previously has been something of a warm-up for St. Patrick's Day. Linda 
Katz, who shared general chairmanship duties with her husband, Mel, and with 
Jan and Mike Madigan, said that, since "A Man for All Seasons" was chosen as 
the focus, the theme aimed at a feeling of Old World sophistication. Thus, 
shamrocks (one year, baskets of Irish potatoes decorated the tables) were 
discarded in favor of clusters of potted Easter lilies, a handsome gesture that 
meant three days of work for decorations honcho Karen Speidel, whose job was to 
glue sheet moss to each of the 460 pots. 
</P>
<P>
The week ended with a somewhat mind-boggling number of major benefits -- most 
of them held at the San Diego Marriott, which seems for the moment to have 
virtually cornered the charity market -- but the Eagen tribute brought out the 
largest crowd of all. The honorary committee list read like a roster of 
community leaders and included Kathy and George Pardee, Ernest and Jean Hahn, 
Episcopal Bishop C. Brinkley Morton, Kathryn and James Colachis, Jane Guymon, 
Rabbi Michael Sternfield, Joanne and Frank Warren, Linda and Frank Alessio, 
Mary and Bruce Hazard, and Betsy and Doug Manchester; the Hazards and 
Manchesters underwrote the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Madigan said the event sold out early, a situation that disappointed those 
turned away but resulted in remarkable net proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just great when you have a total sell-out," said Madigan. "We're going to 
make $210,000, honest to God!" 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that something?" commented Madigan's co-chair, Linda Katz. "We were able 
to do it because of Msgr. Eagen. He's never been honored before in town, even 
though he's done so much for San Diego, and I think that's really the key -- 
people called all week asking for tickets, and many of those who couldn't get 
in still sent contributions." 
</P>
<P>
"This money provides an opportunity of hope to the children," said Msgr. Joe 
Carroll, director of the St. Vincent center. "It also proves that San Diego 
cares." 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds are earmarked specifically for childrens' programs at the downtown 
homeless shelter. Among specific services noted by the program are after-school 
and tutorial programs, meals and shelter, as well as a few less tangible 
benefits, one of which was described as "a parent who is not so frightened or 
exhausted worrying about tomorrow that there is no time for a hug today." 
</P>
<P>
Eagen, who was surrounded by a constant crush of well-wishers through the 
lengthy cocktail hour, seemed to take the attention in stride, although he was 
self-effacing when it came to accepting the honor. "The cause is the important 
thing," he said. "That's what I'm excited about, the fact that these children 
will be helped. I'm just pleased to be part of the program." 
</P>
<P>
The evening progressed with a certain decorum. After the dinner, of 
seafood-stuffed artichokes and medallions of beef tenderloin, the brief formal 
program -- interrupted by several standing ovations -- centered mainly on a 
videotaped tribute to Eagen that also showed scenes of daily life at the St. 
Vincent shelter. The event concluded with dancing to the Sterling orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana Bishop Emilio Berlie joined Bishop Leo Maher at a table hosted by 
trans-border philanthropist Yolanda Walther-Meade. Among others present were 
Bill and Lollie Nelson, Pat and Maggie Crowell, Jack and Lynn Stedd White, 
Helen Anne Bunn, Roger and Judy Benson, Rick Smith, Janet Gallison with Walter 
Fitch, Cush and Betty Dow, and San Diego State University President Tom Day and 
his wife, Anne. 
</P>
<P>
The full San Diego Symphony Orchestra went on a field trip Friday to Marriott 
Hall, but not just to fiddle around. 
</P>
<P>
Resplendent in white dinner jackets, the orchestra made an unprecedented 
appearance at the annual fashion luncheon presented by the symphony's Auxiliary 
Council. The downtown Marriott's largest ballroom proved just large enough to 
accommodate both the immense stage and ramp required by the concert cum clothes 
fest, and the 650 guests. 
</P>
<P>
The event generated intense excitement among the many lifelong symphony 
supporters in the crowd, so much so that more than half attended at the 
top-price patrons category. This fact pleased chairwoman Luba Johnston so much 
that, during the luncheon, she congratulated the group for its wisdom in 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have a wonderful party without wonderful people, so congratulations 
to all of you for being here," said Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
During the cocktail reception, co-chairwoman Virginia Monday said luring the 
orchestra to the show was a genuine coup for the committee, since it was the 
first time in the symphony's 60-year history that it had agreed to play for the 
annual women's luncheon. (Monday, who chaired the final three Combo galas as 
well as other major events before taking a lengthy hiatus from fund-raising, 
will chair the May 1 Celebrity Sports Stars show to be given for the San Diego 
Hall of Champions at the Town &amp; Country.) 
</P>
<P>
It was probably inevitable that the committee chose "Symphony of Fashion" as 
the name of the event, but it did suit the day. The orchestra offered 
Shostakovich's "Festival Overture" straight through the spinach salad, the 
usual roar of voices suppressed to a hushed babble under the baton of conductor 
Richard Amos. The musicians departed before the poached salmon, however, and 
did not return until designer Michael Novarese, who presented his Spring 
collection, had told the audience that having the orchestra play for the show 
would be "an interesting marriage." 
</P>
<P>
At times, in fact, it seemed like the marriage of Figaro, since the orchestra 
swung through a cheerful selection of Broadway standards while the models 
marched down the long, flower-decked ramp wearing severe expressions that might 
better have been accompanied by a dirge. Yet the presentation of music and 
gowns made for a unique and in many ways exhilarating combination, the violins 
tittering at a collection of pastel dresses, the oboes percolating for a sultry 
march of cocktail ensembles. In the audience, there was more agreement over the 
music than the clothes, which one observer described as "Barbara Bush 
fashions." 
</P>
<P>
The close of the show brought applause not only for the orchestra, but for a 
day that many called a landmark occasion. The response, in fact, prompted 
Symphony President Elsie Weston to pledge that the orchestra will play at next 
year's event. "It was such a smash hit that we've got to do it again," she 
said.

JACK SMITH: IN HAWAII, HOW GREEN IS HIS VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Honolulu the lush Nuuanu Valley rises through a pass in the dark green 
mountains to a precipice called the pali. It is a place where people often stop 
and park their cars to peer from a viewpoint above the stupendous cliff out 
over the velvet green coastal plain below. 
</P>
<P>
Our friend Harry Albright drove us up through the valley through vegetation so 
green and thick it made us forget for a moment the concrete excrescence that 
Waikiki had become. From the pali we could see the rugged windward shore of the 
island, and the town of Kaneohe. It was still relatively small and low in 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years one of my jobs on the night desk of the Advertiser had 
been to call the local police departments in Kaneohe and other outposts on the 
island to ask if there was any news. The routine never varied: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Advertiser. Any news tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. No news tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The only time they ever had any news was on Dec. 7, 1941, and that night I 
never bothered to call. We had enough news. 
</P>
<P>
My wife remembered standing at the pali one day when the eminent pianist Artur 
Rubinstein walked up and stood beside her. He was playing that night in 
Honolulu and she went to hear him. Culture is where you find it. 
</P>
<P>
The pali is famous in Hawaiian legend. King Kamehameha, who brought all the 
Hawaiian Islands under his crown, is said to have driven the locals to the pali 
and pushed them over, as commemorated in the popular song (as I remember it): 
</P>
<P>
King Kamehameha, conqueror of the Islands, 
</P>
<P>
Became a famous hero one day. 
</P>
<P>
He conquered the native army, 
</P>
<P>
And pushed them over the pali 
</P>
<P>
And crowned himself 
</P>
<P>
the king of Hawaii Nei. 
</P>
<P>
We drove back down through Waikiki and around Diamond Head and up into its 
crater, a shallow bowl that has become a park. The old gun emplacements could 
still be seen around its crest. It was supposed to make Oahu impregnable, but 
on Dec. 7 it was helpless against the attack by air. 
</P>
<P>
That evening we dined with three shipmates in the Orchids Room of the 
Halekulani, one of the three remaining hotels of the prewar era. It had been a 
charming retreat, a low central building surrounded by cottages. Now the 
cottages were gone, of course, replaced by concrete towers, but the hotel 
itself looked reminiscent of the original, though modernized. 
</P>
<P>
Before dining we had a drink on the terrace overlooking Waikiki Beach. Towering 
palm trees were lighted dramatically. A trio of Hawaiian musicians sang the old 
favorites, among them "Farewell My Tane." 
</P>
<P>
My chest tightened. I had learned that song as a scullion on the S.S. Monterey. 
At night after our watch the chief scullion, a pure Hawaiian, would get out his 
ukulele and sing Hawaiian songs. My favorite of all he sang was "Farewell My 
Tane." 
</P>
<P>
I used to lie on my bunk in the ship's glory hole (that part of the forecastle 
where the lower forms of marine life lived) and wonder if I would ever meet my 
Tane, and whether our relationship would be that poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 Farewell my Tane, child of a coral sea 
</P>
<P>
We dreamed of heaven, now you've forgotten me 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, I never met my Tane. I married a haole girl, and we are still 
together. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning the hostess at our hotel's restaurant asked whether we wanted 
the American or the Japanese buffet. "What's in the Japanese?" I asked naively. 
"Rice, raw fish . . . ,"she began. "American," I interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
I know the war is over. I am even willing to concede that in some respects the 
Japanese won. But my acceptance of things Japanese does not extend to raw fish. 
</P>
<P>
We flew home in a plane so crowded that my wife and I, having changed from a 
later flight, couldn't sit together. Oh well, we had survived longer 
separations. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered white wine with lunch and the flight attendant brought me a small 
can. The weather was rough, and when I opened it, I discovered from the spots 
on my necktie and my pants, alas, that it was red. 
</P>
<P>
But who could complain? At least the door didn't blow out in flight.

MAGAZINES: A NEW BILL OF WRITES FROM N.Y. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two peculiarities confront those who browse through the premiere issue of New 
York Writer, now on newsstands on both coasts and a few places in between. 
</P>
<P>
First, many of those who write -- or are written about -- have nothing to do 
with New York. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it's not a writer's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Editor and publisher Victor Harwood dismissed the inconsistencies with two 
figurative sweeps of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
First, "We have absolutely no interest in New York as a place," he said. 
Second, "We're not a magazine for writers, we're a magazine of writers." 
</P>
<P>
The title is a metaphor "for the psychological state of mind" and the 
intellectual tradition once associated with New York, Harwood said. But the 
magazine expands that tradition geographically to encompass just about anyone 
from anywhere, and pushes back purist literary boundaries to encompass folk who 
write rock music lyrics and even for, heaven forbid, film and television. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finding a Niche 
</P>
<P>
Which may explain why the Winter '89 issue can be found not beside the New York 
Review of Books at Book Soup in Hollywood, but rather directly across Sunset 
Boulevard, nestled amid the fanzines at Tower Records. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think in terms of 'What niche are you filling?' " said 
Harwood, whose event production company, American Expositions Inc., also serves 
as publishing company. "A magazine is needed somewhere between Rolling Stone 
and the New Yorker. New York Writer fits somewhere in there." 
</P>
<P>
Each issue of the glossy quarterly will focus on a single theme, he said. It's 
hard to peg the magazine based on its first uneven issue, devoted to "legends," 
but something of its tone can be gleaned from its dedication to John Lennon. It 
concludes: "To all writers and readers of kind hearts and strong minds, 
wherever you live and call home, we embrace you as New York Writers." 
</P>
<P>
Among the odd tidbits: A Gonzo Journalism Contest (the deadline has passed, but 
Harwood is considering an extension) and a Freedom Watch section, compiled by 
the Committee to Protect Journalists, which includes addressed, tear-out post 
cards to world leaders protesting the detention of reporter Terry Anderson in 
Lebanon, and editors Zwelakhe Sisulu in South Africa and Juan Pablo Cardenas in 
Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Articles run the journalistic/literary gamut, from a serious investigation of 
poet d.a.levy's death 18 years ago (printed on 15 foldout pages), to a two-page 
discussion (they seem serious) of a book that suggests Elvis Presley faked his 
death by staying in a yoga trance while a wax look-alike was buried in an 
air-conditioned coffin. 
</P>
<P>
"We have articles on Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and J. F. K.," Harwood 
said. "Articles on the exact same subjects may appear in People. But we come 
from different ends of the world. . . . (New York Writer) is a magazine that 
shows some reverence for the writer and for the serious consideration of ideas. 
Nevertheless, we have a sense of humor and we find that anything can be of 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
True to Harwood's explanation of the magazine's title, the first issue features 
plenty of non-New Yorkers. Los Angeles is represented by John Rechy, who 
discusses his Marilyn Monroe-inspired novel, "Marilyn's Daughter," and by Frank 
Lisciandro, editor of "Lost Writings of Jim Morrison, Wilderness," who writes 
about his friendship with the legendary Doors singer. 
</P>
<P>
Also included is a personal tribute to a small-scale legend, the late Raymond 
Carver of Port Angeles, Wash. "Carver had reversed the old and tiresome 
American trend, the trajectory of writers who flash with early brilliance and 
promise and then fade, fall apart, are buried under the burden of their 
success. Carver did his falling apart early . . . he'd licked his problems. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
The "Spring Passion Issue," due out around the first of April, will feature 
Brigitte Bardot on the cover and discussions of the Paris literary scene in the 
1950s and other passionate topics inside. 
</P>
<P>
A year's subscription of four issues is $10 from New York Writer, 110 Green 
St., Suite 703, New York, N.Y. 10012) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conde Nast Heads West 
</P>
<P>
Readers who prefer their Western writers without the New York trappings will 
want to check out the Conde Nast Traveler special issue on the "Glory of the 
West." Several writers, most of whom live on this side of Chicago, act as 
guides for what the editors term "American Safaris." The result is some mighty 
fine travel writing -- the kind that provokes thought as well as armchair 
wanderlust. 
</P>
<P>
Novelist Tom McGuane, for instance, opens his elegy like this: "I fish all the 
time when I'm at home; so when I get a chance to go on a vacation, I make sure 
I get in plenty of fishing." 
</P>
<P>
William Kittredge heads for Southeast Oregon on horseback and naturalist writer 
Peter Matthiessen follows the footsteps of George Catlin, the 19th-Century 
artist who captured the Plains Indians on canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Cahill, whose work usually appears in Rolling Stone and Outside magazines, 
heads off on a five-day horsepacking trip through the mountains of Montana. 
Backpacking, he writes, "is an exercise in observing one's own feet and 
counting aloud. But a man on horseback has the energy and inclination to notice 
a profusion of wildflowers or a dust of pollen driven off the trees like mist 
as wind whistles down a draw." 
</P>
<P>
And novelist-poet Jim Harrison, off on a car trip through the back country of 
Nebraska, South Dakota and Montana, observes that "Driving into emptiness keeps 
you at least a few miles ahead of your neuroses, and by the time they catch up 
to you when you bed down in the evening, you are too tired to pay any attention 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the issue is what may well be the last published piece by 
novelist-naturalist Edward Abbey, who died Tuesday in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
For almost 20 years, Abbey wrote irascible, anti-authority essays on man's 
inhumanity to nature for just about every magazine that would publish them -- 
and irascible, anti-authority letters to the editor to those that wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
This account of a horseback descent into Utah's Grand Gulch to observe Indian 
pictographs is typical Abbey: Folksie yarn spinning mixed with pointed 
commentary and clear description. 
</P>
<P>
Abbey fans will not be surprised to stumble upon this simple declarative 
sentence early in his Traveler essay: "It's a good world."

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: TRACING IRISH ROOTS AN UPHILL STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are like millions of Americans, you can trace your roots back to 
Ireland, but even if you can't, on St. Patrick's Day you can become honorary 
Irish for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Irish roots in the New World go back to Colonial days, but since 4.7-million 
Irish came to America between 1820 and 1920, this is the time period when you 
probably will discover your Irish family arrived on these shores. Irish 
research is not easy due to the destruction of the Record Tower in Dublin 
Castle in the early 18th Century and the disastrous 1922 fire in the Public 
Record Office, which nearly obliterated civil records. Successful research for 
Irish ancestors, therefore, depends in large part on access to parish records. 
</P>
<P>
While the LDS (Mormon) Family History Library in Salt Lake City has many Irish 
records on microfilm -- and you should start your search there -- it does not 
have all the records. This library has a sizeable collection of Irish church 
records, but the majority are not yet microfilmed and can only be searched at 
the parish house or by an agent in Ireland. The most critical piece of 
information you need to continue your research in Irish records is a precise 
address -- and the more common the surname you are researching, the more 
critical this advice is. 
</P>
<P>
"Records that provide both names and definite addresses are therefore very 
valuable ways of linking people with places," says James G. Ryan, author of 
"Irish Records: Sources for Family &amp; Local History." The two major records 
used for this purpose are "Griffith's Valuation Survey" in the mid-1800s and 
the "Tithe Applotment Survey" in the early 1800s. Both of these are indexed in 
the "Surname Index" compiled by the National Library of Ireland, which 
indicated how many house/landholders with a particular family name were 
recorded in "Griffith's Valuation Survey," and also where (but not how many) 
landholders of that name are in the "Tithe Applotment Survey." 
</P>
<P>
"By examining the original records indicated in the index, the full names of 
those listed and the town in which they lived can be established," he says. 
Ireland's civil register of births, deaths and marriages, which starts in 1864, 
is a good source for genealogists seeking information about their families who 
came to America in the 19th Century. If you know when the parents of your 
immigrant died, their death certificates may give the family's home address. 
Marriage certificates will reveal the addresses of both partners, and birth 
records also indicate the parents' address. In Ryan's new book, ($38.95 ppd. 
from Ancestry, Inc., 350 South 400 East, Salt Lake City, Utah 84110), each 
chapter (arranged alphabetically by county) has a brief history with 
genealogically significant dates and events. The author discusses what records 
survive, where they are located, and in the case of the church records, the 
address and name of the current clergyman -- everything a researcher needs to 
locate specific types of records. Maps accompany each county. 
</P>
<P>
Another valuable source, seldom utilized by researchers, is Irish newspapers. 
Ryan has included data on them, plus information about commercial and social 
directories, censuses, wills and administrations, and gravestone inscriptions 
in this outstanding new book, which will enable many researchers to find their 
Irish ancestors.

GLENDALE SCALES DOWN HOTEL'S SIZE BUT NOT AMENITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for Glendale's proposed downtown hotel and convention center have been 
scaled down in size, but not in amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The latest design proposal unanimously approved Tuesday by the Glendale 
Redevelopment Agency calls for a 350-room, 18-story hotel to be built on the 
south side of Glenoaks Boulevard between Central Avenue and Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Red Lion Inns of Vancouver, Wash., proposed building a 403-room, 
20-story tower in December. 
</P>
<P>
While city officials had approved the preliminary design of the larger project, 
they said they were concerned about a series of complex issues involving 
traffic circulation and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limitation OKd 
</P>
<P>
Red Lion had agreed to a 350-room limitation when it was awarded the 
development rights two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas W. Henry, vice president of design and development for the hotel chain, 
said architects revised plans after meeting with city officials and 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal calls for dramatic step-backs in the upper floors of the 
tower on both the north and south facades, which will allow for larger rooms 
and suites with corner windows, balconies and sweeping views. 
</P>
<P>
New plans for traffic circulation will include a private street through the 
hotel garage allowing access from Glenoaks Boulevard and Arden Avenue. Drop-off 
points for the hotel lobby will be separated from the entrance to the 
convention wing with its ballroom and banquet areas. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fuller of ELS Design Group of Berkeley, the city's consultant, said the 
"design of the hotel has genuinely improved" with plans that offer more 
"creativity and excitement," such as changes in the form of the building and 
abundant landscaping that will include a large fountain. He said the changes 
represent "a large improvement in quality . . . which will be readily perceived 
by hotel users." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lush Setting 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Knight, acting deputy redevelopment director, said one of the most 
unusual aspects of the urban hotel will be its lush park-like setting. The 
Verdugo Wash, which separates the hotel site from Glenoaks, will be covered 
with concrete and landscaped as part of the park, city officials said. It is 
the first such proposal in Glendale to cover and use a channel owned by the Los 
Angeles County Flood Control District. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Burr, a San Francisco landscape architect working with the developer, 
said landscaping over the wash is a particularly "critical issue." He said 
berms seven feet high and taller will be created to provide enough soil to 
support large conifers and flowering trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's essentially planting on top of concrete," he said. The berms will also 
serve to buffer noise from surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The architecture of the building and the park environment around it will make 
the project one of the more unique hotels in Southern California," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
A final design review is scheduled in 60 days. Construction on the $36-million 
project is expected to begin next fall, with completion projected for the 
spring of 1991.

PRODUCT OF 4-DAY 'CRASH' SESSION; 
</P>
<P>
COMMISSION TO GET LOS FELIZ AREA PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The product of a four-day crash planning session for the Los Feliz area will be 
submitted to the Los Angeles Planning Commission today. 
</P>
<P>
The 83-page document proposes dozens of broad land-use changes as well as 
specific building alterations that its authors hope will freshen up one of the 
city's older regions without sacrificing the quality of an artistic, 
pedestrian-oriented village that residents cherish. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn up by a dozen volunteer experts assembled by the Los Angeles 
Planning Department and the Urban Design Advisory Coalition, a group of Los 
Angeles architects, urban designers and arts professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The planners spent a weekend interviewing residents and business owners from 
the Los Feliz/Vermont/Hillhurst/Barnsdall Park area, then two days hashing out 
and writing their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arts Grant 
</P>
<P>
The effort was one of five crash planning sessions being conducted in Los 
Angeles under a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. The first, 
covering the Van Nuys business district, was completed last October. Similar 
plans will be done for Boyle Heights and Northeast Los Angeles, the Civic 
Center and Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan carries no direct force, it is expected to be used as a 
sounding board for future decisions and as a foundation for government and 
private initiatives in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Among its wide-ranging and often provocative proposals are: 
</P>
<P>
The use of density bonuses and mixed-use zoning along major commercial streets 
such as Hollywood Boulevard, Vermont Avenue and Hillhurst Avenue, meaning that 
up two floors of housing could be built above street-level stores and shops. 
This would increase housing stock and contribute to the use of shops by 
pedestrians, the planners said. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of a parking management association and parking assessment district to 
provide more parking for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption of a pedestrian-oriented district to promote foot traffic along the 
Vermont and Hillhurst commercial districts by encouraging cafes to "spill onto 
the sidewalk and shops display their merchandise in large window displays." 
</P>
<P>
A restructuring of Barnsdall Park, the municipal-cultural center built around 
Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House. This would include renovation of the 
house and grounds, construction of a plaza-style entrance off Vermont to unite 
the park with its surrounding community and rebuilding of a shopping center at 
the foot of the hillside estate to provide visual cohesion and parking for park 
users. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the hospital complex along Sunset Boulevard in a quid pro quo that 
would involve hospitals such as Kaiser Permanente, Childrens and Hollywood 
Presbyterian in efforts to improve Barnsdall Park, establish pedestrian 
connections to a proposed Metro Rail stop at Sunset and Vermont and provide new 
housing for hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of a shuttle to link the hospital complex with residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperative ventures between government and private enterprise to build parking 
structures near the U.S. Post Office on Vermont and the Lucky market on 
Hillhurst. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic measures to encourage the use of Los Feliz Boulevard, Hollywood 
Boulevard and Vermont commuter routes while discouraging through traffic on 
Hillhurst. 
</P>
<P>
Differentiation of Hillhurst as a village-like retail shopping area north of 
Franklin Avenue but with multilevel dwellings south of Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
The framers of the document acknowledge that many of their proposals contain 
built-in contradiction, particularly in connection with housing and traffic 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varied Needs 
</P>
<P>
"Although the objectives of the regional versus local needs tend to conflict, 
the plan must address the circulation needs of both," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, they noted, the desire of hospitals to expand and provide housing 
for their staffs raises concern about their intrusion into residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to maintain a 'good neighbor' balance with the hospitals in 
order to ensure that they are a vital part of the community without changing 
the residential character of adjacent neighborhoods," they said. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the disclaimer, the inherent contradictions brought an immediate 
outcry from one Vermont Avenue businessman. John Leech, who recently opened the 
bohemian coffeehouse, Sequel, after its predecessor, the Onyx, lost its lease a 
few blocks away, said the plan smacked to him of underhanded up-zoning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposals Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"They're planning to triple the density on Hollywood Boulevard from Vermont to 
Hillhurst," Leech said. "These guys are trying to creep in the back door and 
not calling it rezoning, give them density bonuses. It'll create tremendous 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think that the city planning people have already been talking to the 
hospitals and the hospital developers and have pretty much in principle agreed 
to what they're going to do and are only going through this pro forma." 
</P>
<P>
Leech also criticized the notion that the artistic tone of Vermont could be 
enhanced through a pedestrian overlay zone while the street was being promoted 
as a commuter route. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's foolish," he said. "They're going to try to force more traffic up 
the street and yet they're going to try to preserve it as a pedestrian overlay. 
It's contradictory." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the community reserved immediate comment. The Los Feliz Improvement 
Assn., which helped organize the planning session, is scheduled to make a 
presentation when the plan is submitted to the Planning Commission at 11 a.m. 
in Room 353 of City Hall.

$9.5-MILLION PLAN OKD TO REFURBISH CIVIC AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of deliberations, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday unanimously 
approved a $9.5-million renovation plan for the Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for revamping the city-owned building, adding three meeting rooms 
adjacent to the structure, constructing a three-story parking garage and 
improving traffic circulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish colonial revival-style auditorium was built as a public works 
project in 1938. It is home to such community events as antique shows, high 
school dances and beauty pageants. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the cavernous structure had begun to decay. Council members 
grappled for years over whether to preserve the structure at Verdugo Road and 
Mountain Street or to build a new one. They voted last year to undertake the 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
While the building is not considered of great architectural value, community 
leaders and neighborhood associations have led efforts to preserve it. Many 
longtime residents say the auditorium carries memories they cherish.

Yosemite National Park service workers overwhelmingly turned down the latest 
contract proposal from Yosemite Park and Curry Co., authorizing their union to 
call a strike during Easter Week. Spokeswoman Connie Cooper said 91% of the 
members of Service Employees International Union, Local 752, supported the call 
for a possible strike Tuesday. The approximately 750 employees seek improved 
health care benefits and more control over their housing, including the right 
to choose their own roommates.

Convicted mass murderer Charles Manson was transferred this week from San 
Quentin to the state's toughest, new maximum-security section at Corcoran State 
Prison near Tulare, a corrections officer disclosed. Lt. Evelyn Mazon said the 
52-year-old Manson is one of 957 high-risk prisoners that have been moved to 
Corcoran from other prisons since the facility opened early last year. The 
prisons at Folsom, San Quentin and Tehachapi are closing their maximum-security 
units.

Thunderstorms flinging hail and fierce winds damaged cars in Tennessee and 
toppled trees in Virginia, as warm air spread along the Atlantic Coast, setting 
temperature records. The National Weather Service said a cold front clashed 
with a mass of warm, moist air over the Appalachians, triggering the stormy 
afternoon weather. Weather service spokesman Brian Smith said hail damaged 
automobiles at Copperhill, Tenn., and McCaysville, Ga., while in Virginia, 
winds gusted to 81 m.p.h. at Virginia Beach and 69 m.p.h. at the Norfolk Naval 
Air Station. Temperatures rose into the 50s and 60s over much of New England, 
reaching a record 76 in Baltimore.

Police and striking workers in Rio de Janeiro and three other Brazilian cities 
fought sporadic battles, leaving 10 people wounded, in the second day of a 
48-hour nationwide strike to protest the government's economic austerity 
program, officials said. Rio's subway, commuter ferry and government-run 
commuter trains, which carry about 1 million passengers a day, remained idle. 
Brazil's two main trade unions organized the strike to protest what they 
describe as a 40% cut in real wages since March, 1986. The unions are calling 
on the government to lift a price and wage freeze, imposed in January to help 
control 1,000% inflation.

A sheriff's deputy's killer, whose 1985 grant of clemency from New York Gov. 
Mario M. Cuomo was denounced by then-Vice President George Bush, has been 
granted parole. The decision to release Gary McGivern, convicted of murder in 
the 1968 shooting, followed his appearance before a three-member Board of 
Parole panel at the medium-security prison in Otisville where he is serving a 
life sentence. It was McGivern's third parole board appearance since Cuomo's 
grant of clemency, which made him eligible for an immediate parole hearing. 
Twice McGivern was turned down because of the nature of the crime.

The National Weather Service announced a major modernization program that 
officials said will streamline the agency by eliminating more than 100 local 
offices and reducing the staff by 800 but producing improved forecasts. The 
weather service will go from about 250 local offices to just 115 when the 
changeover is completed about 1995, said Albert W. Friday, the weather service 
director. He said the shutdowns will be gradual and most will not occur until 
1993 or later. Earlier this week, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher 
announced that weather service stations will remain open until the 
modernization process is complete, putting to rest rumors that 70 or more 
weather stations would close this year due to budget constraints.

Tens of thousands of Hungarians took to the streets in Budapest to celebrate 
new freedoms in one of the largest displays of nationalist sentiment since the 
anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. It was the first time in 41 years that Communist 
officials had made a public legal holiday of the March 15 anniversary of 
Hungary's unsuccessful revolt against Austria in 1848. A 12-point declaration 
calling for more freedom and independence was read at a large rally in front of 
the Hungarian state television offices. The declaration also demanded the 
withdrawal of Soviet troops, a multi-party political system and freedom of 
speech and the press.

The kids are coming. And this year, officials vowed Wednesday, this border city 
will be ready. 
</P>
<P>
With bars, discotheques and restaurants already gearing up for the onslaught of 
spring-break revelers from the United States, authorities from Tijuana and San 
Diego conducted a strategy meeting Wednesday to discuss "unprecedented" 
preparations to deal with impending arrival of America's youth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protection Stepped Up 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, officials vowed, police protection will be increased on 
both sides of the border, ambulances and hospitals will be put on alert, 
assorted "rescue" squads will be mobilized and, in a novel twist, visitors will 
be provided with brochures outlining some "dos" and "don'ts" south of the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana authorities have already begun a crackdown on drinking establishments 
that are not properly licensed or that serve alcohol after the mandatory 3 a.m. 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope Easter Week will be a safe week," said Sergio Lujan Chavez, who 
oversees the Tijuana civil-protection office. 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds like an invasion, that's exactly the way Mexican law-enforcement 
authorities are treating it. 
</P>
<P>
And they're not alone. San Diego police say they will be on the lookout for 
inebriated youths returning to the United States after late-night forays south 
of the border. (Most revelers park their cars on the U. S. side and enter 
Mexico as pedestrians, a situation that presents obvious traffic hazards as the 
youths return to San Diego and attempt to drive north, often as far as Los 
Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be on the lookout for people coming across under the influence 
or being particularly rowdy," said Dave Cohen, a San Diego police spokesman, 
who added that police will bolster patrols on San Diego-area beaches during the 
spring break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing in Popularity 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana may not be as storied a spring-break destination as Ft. Lauderdale or 
Palm Springs, but more and more teen-agers are flocking to the border city. 
Tijuana's image as a bastion of sleaze for servicemen and single males has 
gradually been giving way to new popularity as a mecca for U. S. teen-agers of 
both sexes attracted by its glitzy bars, sybaritic atmosphere, generally 
inexpensive good times and 18-year-old drinking age. (One has to be 21 to 
purchase alcoholic beverages in California.) Tavern owners have been quick to 
change their pitch in a city where tourism is the No. 1 industry. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south, Ensenada is appealing to a similar crowd. Adding to the allure 
are miles of stunning coast, dotted with sandy beaches. 
</P>
<P>
On most Friday and Saturday evenings, hordes of the college-age partiers 
converge on this city with fun on their minds. The traffic of those seeking 
solace in the south is expected to intensify beginning Friday, as students on 
break join the fun. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the inebriated youths must be carried back across the border by 
colleagues. Many appear to regard Tijuana and other Mexican border cities as 
wide-open party towns where inhibitions can be shed and anything goes. Not so. 
Mexican authorities warn that many infractions -- notably drug offenses -- may 
carry stiffer sentences south of the border than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some very strict laws here," noted Julio Tejera, a spokesman for 
Mayor Federico Valdez Martinez. "We want people to have fun, but we want them 
to obey the law." 
</P>
<P>
More than a few end up in the city jail, a bleak and noisy barracks downtown. 
Comprehending the Mexican legal system can be a daunting task for a foreigner 
who speaks limited Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nudists Go Home 
</P>
<P>
A piece of advice from the brochure: "Loud cursing, throwing bottles, littering 
and nudism are not appreciated in Mexico (you may be arrested)." 
</P>
<P>
Officials have also vowed to cut down on the extortion of tourists, which has 
been a longtime problem in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to exploit tourism, not the tourist," said William Yu Cong, president 
of the city's Tourism and Conventions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
A tip from the brochure: "No law official is authorized to take money from you. 
Do not hand over money." 
</P>
<P>
And: "Bribery in Mexico is considered a violation -- avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
The latter is in line with recent declarations from the city's new police 
chief, Jose Francisco Mora Rodarte, who has already announced his intention to 
end police corruption. Such statements, usually followed by quick firings of 
certain "bad elements" -- Mora said he had already dumped more than 50 police 
officers for sundry violations in his seven weeks on the job -- are pro forma 
in large Mexican cities, where official bribery and corruption is widespread 
but always condemned, particularly by new administrations pledged to "moral 
renovation." 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to give better protection and better service," said Mora, 
appearing at the strategy session of area law-enforcement and tourism officials 
seeking to prepare for the arrival of the young U. S. vacationers. "But the 
tourists must know that we have laws, too."

150 OF SAN DIEGUITO DISTRICT'S TEACHERS PLAY HOOKY FOR DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mounting frustration from working without a contract for nearly nine months 
spurred more than 150 teachers from the San Dieguito Union High School District 
to abandon their classrooms Wednesday in what administrators term an 
unauthorized sickout. 
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled faculty members, who have been seeking both salary increases and 
substantially improved health and fringe benefits since their contract expired 
last June, failed to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
The labor action depleted the district's 350-member teaching staff by about 50% 
and forced administrators to scramble in search of substitute teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators, who heard rumors about a sickout late Tuesday afternoon, 
quickly began recruiting substitutes but were only able to hire about 70 
temporary replacements. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher shortage disrupted classroom sessions at most of the six district 
schools and particularly affected the teaching day at its two high schools: 
Torrey Pines in Del Mar and San Dieguito in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"All the schools are functioning, but primarily the two high schools have been 
impacted," said Supt. Bill Berrier. "We are hiring as many substitutes as we 
can. But, in the interim, you are forced to make due. We've been combining 
three or four classrooms." Berrier said the schools will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
The sickout marked another turn for the worse in the prolonged labor dispute, 
which teachers and parents describe as one of the most bitter events to engulf 
the district in over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the stalled negotiations have involved much more than district 
officials: Recently, community members showed support for the faculty by 
holding a candlelight vigil and a March 2 rally that supporters say attracted 
200 people. Last month, more than 100 students at San Dieguito High School 
staged a sit-in to support their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Since December, when the two parties declared an impasse, negotiations have 
proceeded with the help of a state mediator. Earlier this month, the school 
district presented an offer to the San Dieguito Faculty Assn., which 
overwhelmingly rejected the proposal, 227 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
The sickout followed the parties' last meeting held on Tuesday, when the 
district called a meeting to make another offer. Leaders of the faculty 
association scoffed at the second offer as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ridiculous Offer' 
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations broke down again yesterday after they made their ridiculous 
offer," said Bob Croft, who is heading the negotiating team for the faculty 
association. "Every day this situation goes on they are placing themselves 
deeper and deeper into a hole. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 10 years that I have been here, I have never seen the teachers so 
frustrated and angry," Croft said. 
</P>
<P>
No further meetings have been scheduled between the two parties, and officials 
did not know whether the sickout would continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to speculate. . . . I have no idea if there will be another one," said 
Croft, who is also an English teacher at Earl Warren Junior High in Solana 
Beach. "But I want to make it clear that the faculty association does not 
encourage or support such activities." 
</P>
<P>
District administrators plan to keep the schools open and are continuing to 
hire more substitutes in anticipation of a sustained teacher absence. 
</P>
<P>
"We are anticipating that the sickout will continue," said Don Kemp, assistant 
superintendent/personnel. "We have no indication otherwise, so we have to be 
prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said an effort was made to contact all absent teachers, who were asked to 
bring a note from a doctor upon their return, stating that they were ill. The 
normal absentee rate among district teachers is 6%, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
If there is evidence of unjustified absences, the district has the right to 
take punitive actions, which could include docking of pay and dismissal, Kemp 
said. But, thus far, Kemp said, no decisions have been made to take such 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not looking at dismissing anyone," Kemp said. "We have outstanding 
teachers, and we are looking positively to having them back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health Coverage Lacking 
</P>
<P>
One of the teachers' major grievances is that the district does not offer 
comprehensive health coverage for families of its employees, Croft said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides securing a better health benefit package, faculty members are seeking a 
wage increase, a right to binding arbitration and a seniority-based job 
transfer program. 
</P>
<P>
"If a job opens up within the district, we want the district to give the 
teachers who are already here a chance instead of bringing in people from the 
outside," Croft said. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents and students expressed hope that their teachers will receive a 
fair settlement soon. Otherwise, not only will classroom schedules be 
disrupted, but the district could lose some of its best teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 99% of the student population is behind the teachers," said Aaron 
Lowenberg, a San Dieguito High School senior who participated in the sit-in 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got to school today, most of the classrooms didn't have any teachers," 
Aaron said. "I hear they're lining up substitute teachers, but, if they don't, 
there's no way the school could run." 
</P>
<P>
June Lowenberg, Aaron's mother, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"This has already disrupted our children's education," Lowenberg said. "I don't 
think the teachers have received support from the administration. We're at the 
point where we will lose our best teachers." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is the last remaining teacher-district face-off in North County. 
Teachers in Vista reached agreement earlier this month after many months of 
working under an expired contract.

SAN MARCOS WANTS TO OPERATE OWN TRASH PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Marcos city officials, saying they are frustrated that a trash-to-energy 
plant has not yet been approved by the county for construction in their city, 
are investigating the possibility of developing their own landfill on which to 
build their own trash plant. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lee Thibadeau proposes that the city operate its own trash-processing 
plan for its own residents -- and let the county look elsewhere to build a 
regional recycling and trash-burning plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fed up. We've cooperated (with the county), and we've waited and we've 
worked with them, and still there is a lack of negotiations" between the county 
and the would-be trash plant builder, Thibadeau said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been taking care of the entire region's trash problems, and now it's 
time we protect the San Marcos voters, the guys who are paying my wages," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By a 4-1 vote Tuesday night, the San Marcos City Council approved several 
Thibadeau proposals which, the mayor said, could force the county to abandon 
its own landfill and pave the way for San Marcos to enter the trash business. 
The city staff was instructed to report back its initial findings and reaction 
to the mayor's proposal at a City Council meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they don't believe Thibadeau's proposal holds much merit, 
either for his own city or for the county as a whole. And the company that 
Thibadeau would have build a trash plant for the city's own use says it is 
still committed to working with the county for a regional trash plant. 
</P>
<P>
But Thibadeau said he has done enough initial investigation to give him the 
confidence that his idea is worth pursuing. The only council member to object 
was Pia Harris, who has steadfastly opposed a trash-burning power plant in her 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Among the mayor's requests were that: 
</P>
<P>
* The city's attorney investigate whether the county has violated the city's 
special-use permit, which governs the landfill site, and consider a number of 
remedies -- including revoking the permit allowing the landfill in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Thibadeau said he believes the county has allowed the land filling to occur to 
a height higher than the city allowed and has expanded the boundaries of the 
landfill to exceed the original boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
* The city consider condemning the landfill itself, in order to allow the city 
to take over its operations. 
</P>
<P>
* The city negotiate with neighboring landowners to buy land adjoining the 
existing landfill for the city to develop as its own burial ground for trash. 
</P>
<P>
* The city begin negotiations with Thermo Electron Corp., which hopes to build 
and operate a $250-million, trash-to-energy plant at the San Marcos landfill on 
behalf of the county, to build a smaller plant for the exclusive use of San 
Marcos and any other cities that might contract directly with San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
"I have verified to the extent I've needed to in the past few months that the 
county of San Diego is in direct violation of certain provisions of the 
special-use permit they're operating under," Thibadeau said. "They have 
exceeded the height limitation of the fill-in area, and the boundaries have 
exceeded what was originally drawn up. Furthermore, I suspect they might be 
infringing on an archeological site." 
</P>
<P>
Thibadeau contends that the county has knowingly exceeded the limits and did so 
because, if the landfill were maintained within the established limits, it 
already would be full, forcing the county to send trash to more distant 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't hold much hope that the city could condemn the landfill and 
bring it under city ownership because the same criteria the city would use -- 
issues of public safety and welfare -- could be argued by the county in 
retaining ownership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special-Use Permit 
</P>
<P>
There is more likelihood, Thibadeau said, that the county will be found in 
violation of the city's special-use permit to operate the trash plant. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he acknowledges, if the city were to attempt to revoke the permit, the 
county would probably respond with legal action that would at least allow it to 
operate the landfill until the matter is resolved in court. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hurdles, legally and logistically, of turning the county out of San 
Marcos, Thibadeau said the time has come to pursue it as an option. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, the county will bring over 1.3 million tons of trash into San Marcos. 
Almost 50% of that comes from Carlsbad, Escondido and Encinitas -- the very 
cities that are suing us for attempting to solve the county's long-range 
solid-waste problems by building the trash plant," Thibadeau said. 
</P>
<P>
"But our city only produces 43,000 tons of trash a year. Every 12 days we allow 
the county to continue operating the landfill, they are costing us a year of 
space that would otherwise be available to us." 
</P>
<P>
The landfill is expected to reach capacity in 1991, and county officials say 
they would need to expand the landfill in order to serve the proposed trash 
plant, which would recycle some of North County's trash, burn much of it and 
bury the rest -- including the resulting ash. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos officials -- supported by a public, citywide vote -- already have 
approved the construction of the plant, which would generate millions of 
dollars more for the city. But the plant would operate under contract with the 
county, and it is that contract that must still be negotiated between the Board 
of Supervisors and Thermo Electron. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
April Beginning 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are expected to begin in April, both parties say. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Welch, the project manager for Thermo Electron, said he doesn't want to 
speculate on the possibility that his company could build a smaller version of 
the plant for San Marcos' exclusive use. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we are presently on track and absolutely committed to the 
negotiations with the county on our service agreement, period. We have not had 
discussions with the city on their proposal," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be speculation to say whether their proposal makes sense," he said. 
"For the time being, we'll buckle down and get our negotiations done with the 
county. It would certainly be better for everybody involved if we were to run 
down the road we've been running down and come to the finish line with a plant 
that would serve everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the feelings of impatience by a city that has supported this 
project all along and which sees a landfill filling up while time marches on," 
Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Walsh, the county's deputy director of public works, said Thibadeau's 
contention that the county has overstepped its bounds at the landfill was news 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not knowingly or unknowingly operated outside the conditions of the 
use permit," he said. "We will review the suggestion that we have. We have a 
fairly good aerial mapping system, and we'll review it. In the event we are (in 
violation), we'll meet with the city and try to resolve any difficulties we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he will meet with the staff of county counsel today to discuss 
whether San Marcos has any legal grounds to revoke the county's permit to 
operate the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Support Notion 
</P>
<P>
But philosophically, Walsh said he cannot support San Marcos' notion to go out 
on its own in the trash business. 
</P>
<P>
"The county has the responsibility for solid-waste management planning. We 
operate the landfills which serve all the cities except San Diego, and all the 
unincorporated area, and we will continue to serve them," Walsh said. "We feel 
we already have a binding contract with Thermo Electron to build and operate 
the facility, and all we are negotiating at this time is a major modification 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Anthony, a solid-waste program manager for the county, said he doesn't 
think San Marcos is willing or capable of backing the trash plant on its own. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they willing to put up their general fund to back the plant's operation? 
Are they ready to take responsibility for a landfill, and deal with all the 
state regulations on garbage?" said Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
"The county is willing to do those things because the county is the lead agency 
for solid-waste disposal for the entire county, and we share that obligation 
with everybody in the county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors in January authorized its staff to open negotiations with 
Thermo Electron and set a 60-day deadline to complete the talks. But those 
talks have not yet begun, Walsh said, because the county has had to hire 
consultants to advise it on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The trash plant also is targeted in a number of still-unresolved lawsuits by 
opponents on a variety of environmental and procedural grounds.

FINE FOOD: THE CAT'S MEOW; 
</P>
<P>
VETERINARIAN OWNS GOURMET RESTAURANT AS HIS SECOND PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By day, he operates on cats, dogs and wounded birds. By night, he's a writer, 
having produced such classics as "All Creatures Great and Small." British 
veterinarian James Herriott has reaped a harvest from what some would call an 
exotic double life. 
</P>
<P>
By day, Ronald Ridgway is the owner of North Park Veterinary Hospital on Park 
Boulevard, which specializes in the treatment of birds and reptiles but has 
barking dogs and purring cats as well. His twin passions are veterinary 
medicine and gourmet cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
By night, he's the owner of Silas St. John, one of San Diego's most elegant 
restaurants, and, some say, its best. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statute Opened the Door 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Ridgway took advantage of a rare San Diego ordinance that 
permits a residence being converted to commercial use -- such as that of a 
restaurant -- if deemed a historic site. Silas St. John is a craftsman-style 
house on Kensington Drive in Kensington built 79 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
St. John, one of the first stagecoach drivers on the Southwest route of the 
Overland-Butterfield-Wells Fargo lines, bought the house in 1914. The house 
received its historical designation in 1982, and, by the time Ridgway opened 
the restaurant in 1985, he says, he had spent $200,000 to buy the house and 
another $800,000 to fix it up. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Silas St. John, which specializes in what Ridgway calls "regional 
American gourmet cooking" and fine, vintage wines (mostly from California), won 
the annual California Restaurant Writers' award. Its reputation has been 
enhanced, it would seem, by the demise of two other gourmet restaurants that 
critics used to fawn over -- Gustaf Anders in La Jolla and Sheppard's on Harbor 
Island. (The Sheppard's name still appoints the restaurant at the Sheraton 
Harbor Island, but the cuisine and chef are gone, replaced by less ambitious 
fare.) 
</P>
<P>
Their demise has brought Ridgway and Silas St. John more business and more 
recognition. But the two other restaurants' undoing is also what saddens him 
about the business, especially in San Diego, which in his words isn't a great 
restaurant town. Their demise is also what scares him about the risk he has 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gourmet Taste Lacking 
</P>
<P>
"Take a look at the number of Mexican restaurants in San Diego," Ridgway said 
with a frown, as a starch-white cockatoo perched atop his shoulder. "I'm not 
putting Mexican food down, but this is a bean town. People here go to El Indio 
(which serves Mexican food to go and for sitting down). It tends to be a 
fast-food town, a steak town. The watering holes do great. You know, the Rusty 
Pelicans, that sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the good ones just haven't made it. A great restaurant called 926 -- 
it was where Gustaf Anders later was in La Jolla -- also went under. Then, 
Gustaf Anders couldn't make it. Sheppard's was a great restaurant, and, even 
working under the rubric of the Sheraton hotel chain, it couldn't make it. This 
just isn't an elite restaurant town, and so a guy like me, who's made this huge 
investment, well, yeah, it scares me. San Diego is a town that has yet to 
mature in many ways, gourmet dining being one of them." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of folks would agree with Ridgway, who, at 49, is stocky, built like a 
linebacker, boyishly youthful and persuasive. But what might surprise them is 
where he's making these comments -- in the operating room of a veterinary 
clinic, surrounded by a pair of Persian cats that look utterly terrified by the 
cockatoo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practice Has Evolved 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway opened the clinic in 1976. His practice has changed as the neighborhood 
around it has changed. No longer is it dominated by elderly widows and widowers 
who bring in pets that represent the last link to the memory of a fallen 
spouse. Now, it's young, rich, upwardly mobile types whose "thirtysomething" 
life styles include pets, usually exotic ones. They can afford the $300,000 
houses that were once bought for a song. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway said clients are often astonished when they learn he has an elaborate, 
expensive wine cellar, not just in the basement of Silas St. John but also in 
the basement of the clinic. His double life has allowed him to be a wine 
connoisseur who stores wine in the basement of the clinic that later ends up on 
the tables of three competitors -- fellow restaurant owners. 
</P>
<P>
Another bit of Ridgway trivia: The basement of the clinic was built as a bomb 
shelter by the previous owner, who, as a member of the John Birch Society, just 
knew the Red Scare would mean nuclear holocaust at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway said both businesses are stressful -- both require long hours and 
present their share of vexing emotion -- but, after soothing the grieving 
feelings of pet owners whose animals have had to succumb to euthanasia, he 
enjoys sipping Bordeaux wines in the basement of Silas St. John in the evenings 
while chatting with the customers. Sometimes, there's an overlap. He now offers 
a discount at the restaurant for clients of the clinic -- at their request. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son's Cooking Praised 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway's son, Derek Ridgway, is the chef of Silas St. John, a self-taught 
"restaurant hopper" who has gotten high marks from critics for the touch he has 
with "game birds." Don't customers sometimes needle him on the incongruity of 
his father making little birds well while the son serves them up at night? 
</P>
<P>
"All the time," Derek said with a laugh. "It's the standing joke. I just tell 
them I get all of Dad's mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Ridgway said Derek learned to cook "out of desperation" -- he's one of three 
children from a previous marriage, and living with a single father meant it was 
"cook or die." He also read a lot, and not just the directions for Tuna Helper. 
</P>
<P>
Like his dad, Derek is quite aware of the challenges and stresses. New tax 
legislation has made it rougher on small businesses, the son says, especially 
on a restaurant that both say has yet to show a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still putting more money into it every year than we're getting out of 
it," Ronald Ridgway said. 
</P>
<P>
He's also frustrated by the eccentricities of the San Diego restaurant-goer. He 
can't quite understand why it isn't the type of town where people like to dine 
out anytime after 9 p.m. He doesn't like the rap that Silas St. John is, to 
some, expensive, when he feels that gourmet outlets, such as Masa in San 
Francisco, which serves a similar cuisine, cost twice as much and often require 
reservations a year in advance. He is also upset at having to turn away 175 
reservations for special occasions, such as Feb. 14, because Silas St. John 
seats only 58. 
</P>
<P>
He said a five-course meal, which starts in the basement with wine, is likely 
to cost a minimum of $45 per person -- for food -- with the average cost of a 
bottle of wine about $24.

<P>
Tied to Animals 
</P>
<P>
He said he loves the veterinary business and intends to stay in it until he's 
65. He still struggles most with the everyday chore of having to comfort 
someone whose animal is too sick to live. In telling one such story, Ridgway's 
voice choked up and tears welled up in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing I've had to do, and I've had to do it four or five times, is 
put down a blind person's Seeing Eye dog because it had cancer," he said. 
"Those people are so devoted and so dependent on those animals. I empathize 
with them so deeply. It's also tough when little kids are involved. They just 
don't understand why an animal can't make it. 
</P>
<P>
"But, as hard as both businesses are, I'll continue to do them for one simple 
reason: I love them. That's the only reason worth doing anything."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury Wednesday found that convicted murderer Francisco Urias Uriarte was sane 
when he killed two people and attempted to kill two others. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated an hour before deciding that Uriarte was sane while high 
on drugs when he killed two people and wounded two others Oct. 15, 1987, in 
Spring Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte's attorney, Athena Shudde, had asked the jury to find her client insane 
at the time of the incident because he was high on cocaine, marijuana and beer. 
According to testimony of psychiatrists called by the defense, Uriarte suffered 
from acute drug psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte was convicted Friday of murdering Jeff Constantino, 37, and his wife, 
Nancy, 36, who were visiting a friend and neighbor of Uriarte, John Alva, 34. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte, 33, went to Alva's apartment, saying he believed his wife was being 
held captive there, even though she was in a Tijuana hospital. 
</P>
<P>
After being told by Alva that his wife was not there and believing Alva and the 
Constantinos were laughing at him, Uriarte returned with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
He opened fire on Jeff Constantino and then on Nancy Constantino. He then shot 
Alva, who was attempting to flee, several times in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte then left the murder scene and shot Tom Eberwein, 33. 
</P>
<P>
According to a psychiatrist who interviewed the defendant, Uriarte told him he 
thought the gun, a 9mm pistol, was a tomato and Alva and the Constantinos were 
some kind of wolf or dog people. 
</P>
<P>
"The offenses here, as horrible as they may be, are also bizarre," Shudde told 
the jury. "There are no rational reasons why they occurred. . . . He was a man 
not in his right mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The drugs created a mental defect. These were the acts of a man who didn't 
know what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Walden told the jury that Uriarte must face 
the consequences of his actions regardless of whether he was high on drugs. 
Quoting medical reports, he said Uriarte is sane and was aware during the 
murders that what he was doing was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Walden said it is up to the defense to prove that Uriarte didn't know he was 
committing murder and that he didn't understand that what he was doing was 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"His fleeing of the scene and then hiding is proof he knew what he did was 
wrong," Walden told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte was convicted of one count of first-degree murder, one count of 
second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. He was also found to 
have committed the crime under special circumstances, but the district attorney 
did not seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Uriarte will be sentenced April 12 and could be given life in prison without 
parole.

A Mission Hills man is scheduled to be arraigned today after police found a 
flammable methamphetamine laboratory in the basement of his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Guthrie, 33, was being held Wednesday in lieu of $100,000 bail on 
suspicion of manufacturing narcotics, a jail spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, San Diego Police Narcotics Task Force officers seized a large flask 
containing four gallons of chemicals heating in the first stage before becoming 
the liquid form of methamphetamine, Sgt. Alan Truitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also seized three grams of the drug in its powdered form and equipment 
to manufacture the drug, Truitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The lab was discovered in a basement by a landlord, who, at Guthrie's request, 
was performing repairs at the two-story apartment building in the 1200 block of 
West Redwood Street. 
</P>
<P>
Truitt said the lab, which was nestled near a crawl area, had an elaborate 
ventilation and filter system. It is believed to have been able to produce 8 to 
10 pounds of the powdered form of the drug every three days, with an estimated 
street value of $170,000.

RIGHTS ACTIVISTS CLAIM INS TACTICS 'BARBARIC'

Human rights activists from Mexico and the United States on Wednesday condemned 
what they said is an upswing in violence against illegal aliens by agents of 
the U. S. Border Patrol, who were accused of cramming detainees into vehicles 
in "barbaric" fashion. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Border Patrol, an enforcement arm of the federal 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, dismissed the charges as 
"preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Martinez, a San Diego-based activist, singled out for criticism an 
alleged practice in which agents force as many as 12 undocumented people into 
the back of the patrols' green and white Ford Broncos. There is barely space in 
the vehicles for five or six people, said Martinez, who charged that the 
vehicles sometimes drive for up to two hours with the human cargo in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worse Than the Pound 
</P>
<P>
"The animals taken by the pound aren't even treated this way," said Martinez, 
who represents the American Friends Service Committee, the social action arm of 
the Quaker Church. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Kwast, acting assistant chief Border Patrol agent in San Diego, said that, 
in general, no more than seven people are placed in the back of the vehicles, 
which he said are used for short-term detention and transportation. Agents are 
instructed to summon larger vans once they have more than a few people in 
custody, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't put them in like cattle," Kwast said. 
</P>
<P>
The activists spoke at a Tijuana news conference that was also attended by 
Victor Clark Alfaro, who heads the Tijuana-based Binational Center of Human 
Rights. The groups called for the Border Patrol to stop using the vehicles to 
transport arrested foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Figures Provided 
</P>
<P>
No figures were offered to buttress the allegations of an increase in violence, 
but the activists cited the case of Raymundo Estrada Guerrero, who sat in on 
the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a 24-year-old Mexican citizen, says he was beaten without provocation 
by a Border Patrol agent on the evening of March 5, after he was arrested in 
San Ysidro, just 20 yards north of the border. On Wednesday, his left eye and 
lips swollen, he wore a handkerchief over his face to conceal his identity out 
of fear of Border Patrol retribution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who does not know the name of the agent he says beat him, said he 
plans to cross the border again illegally, and does not want to be recognized 
by the agents should he be apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
The activists said they plan to file a complaint on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Kwast said he knew nothing of the Estrada case but that any complaints of 
mistreatment will be thoroughly investigated.

PROTEST STRANDS 140 TRASH TRUCKS; 
</P>
<P>
LOPEZ CANYON BLOCKED AGAIN 
</P>

<P>
Protesters blocked the Lopez Canyon Landfill entrance for four hours Wednesday 
morning, stranding 140 full trash trucks along three miles of city streets and 
remaining until Los Angeles police threatened to arrest them for illegal 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The 42 participants declared this, their third protest of a proposed landfill 
expansion, a success and vowed to return again. 
</P>
<P>
"We are tired of being the dump of the city of Los Angeles," said Jose DeSosa, 
state president of the NAACP and long-time Pacoima activist. 
</P>
<P>
City sanitary engineer Malcolm Toy said the city decided to "just be patient" 
rather than reroute the trucks to private landfills as was done during the Feb. 
23 protest. Toy said the protest might have forced the drivers to skip garbage 
pickup in some Los Angeles neighborhoods Wednesday, although he said that would 
not be known until today. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the South Coast Air Quality Management District on 
Wednesday cited the landfill for garbage excavation that released fumes that 
sickened two workers March 8. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AQMD Permit 
</P>
<P>
The excavation was being completed without the necessary AQMD permit, said 
spokesman Bill Kelly. The maximum fine for the violation is $25,000, Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One worker fainted and another was hospitalized March 8 after unearthing a 
layer of garbage, which Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said might have 
contained hazardous hydrogen sulfide gas. The AQMD will begin setting up air 
sampling equipment at the landfill this week to determine what the gas was, 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Worker Keith O'Kray, 33, of Newhall, remains at St. Joseph Medical Center in 
Burbank, where he was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Katz asked the city Bureau of Sanitation to close the dump while circumstances 
surrounding the incident are investigated. In a letter sent Tuesday to city 
sanitation director Delwin Biaggi, Katz accused the city of trying to downplay 
the incident by not releasing information about it until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Toy defended the delay in public notification concerning the accident, 
saying that city officials did not realize until last Thursday that the two 
workers' illnesses were linked. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not a cover-up," he said. "It was just due to the way the events 
unfolded." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon, which opened in 1975 as a county landfill, accepts more than half 
the city's household garbage -- 4,000 tons a day. Although the landfill 
originally was to be closed in 1992, recently the city proposed keeping it open 
until 2005 and doubling its capacity.

COURT ORDERS PACOIMA SCHOOL TO MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Encino Municipal Court commissioner ruled against a Pacoima preschool 
Wednesday, ordering it to move within 40 days and to pay the landlord's 
attorney fees and damages of more than $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Rodriguez, administrator of Escuela de la Gente, called the assessment of 
damages vindictive and said the school would appeal Commissioner Joseph R. 
Ruffner's decision. Rodriguez said the 75-pupil school will have to close if it 
does not have at least three months to move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like picking up the TV, the dog and the two kids and moving," said 
Enrique Vela, who helped organize the school in 1979 and is seeking city 
permits needed for the move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incomplete Arrangements 
</P>
<P>
The school has been negotiating to move into a Pacoima Methodist church, but 
arrangements are not final. Vela said even if the church signed a lease this 
week, city and state permits and licenses would take time. Also, two of the 
school's three classrooms are portable units that must be moved to the new 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Escuela de la Gente, "School of the People," was founded to provide a bilingual 
head start for children in the northeast San Fernando Valley. Many parents are 
single mothers who must work or go to school for their children to qualify for 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
Property owner Keith Markovitch notified the school last summer that its lease 
would expire in September, then issued an eviction order in December. However, 
Rodriguez testified during the court hearings this week that Markovitch told 
him he could probably stay six to nine more months. 
</P>
<P>
Markovitch denied making that promise. He said Wednesday that he was pleased 
with the ruling, except for the 40-day delay. The property is in escrow with a 
mini-mall developer, he said, and the school's eviction is one of the 
conditions of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew for five years that their lease was going to come to an end," he 
said. "If it wasn't for the kids, I think it should've been immediate." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating expiration of the lease, school officials had talked with another 
church for more than a year. Negotiations fell through in October, when the 
church's regional board rejected the idea of housing the school. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Markovitch's attorney, Steven Harrison, said his client 
should not be blamed for the school's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my client's fault," Harrison said. "He should not be forced to bear 
the risk and expense. It's the fault of Escuela de la Gente. They put all their 
eggs in one basket. They were unwise."

4 DISTRICTS WARMING TO UNIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spirit of unification appeared to gain strength this week when trustees and 
superintendents from four beach city school districts discussed ways to merge 
their schools to produce one or more larger systems. 
</P>
<P>
The ways were outlined by county and state experts, who met Tuesday night in 
Redondo Beach with officials from the South Bay Union High School District and 
elementary districts serving Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Unification is definitely in the wind," said high school district Trustee 
Armando Acosta, "All the questions tonight were about how to do it. Nobody was 
interested in the negative side." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta's district earlier this year began promoting the idea of consolidating 
all four districts as a way of dealing with drastic declines in public school 
enrollment in the three beach cities in the last 15 or 20 years. Officials 
there have suggested consolidating all four districts into one 12,000-student 
system for kindergarten-through-12th grade students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for More Talks 
</P>
<P>
Trustees from the elementary districts agreed that the time seems right for 
unification, but said much more talking and information will be needed before 
they agree on the form it should take. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us food for thought tonight, and I'm definitely for some kind of 
unification," said Redondo Beach board President Howard Huizing. "But it's 
going to take a while to sort everything out." 
</P>
<P>
His board, which was host for the joint meeting at the Redondo Beach district 
headquarters, has favored a unified district in that city, possibly including 
elementary and high school students from Hermosa Beach, rather than a 
consolidation of all four systems. 
</P>
<P>
Individual trustees have cited community identity and a desire to preserve 
local control as important factors. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Campbell, president of the Manhattan Beach board, said residents of her 
city are concerned about those factors, too. She also said many questions 
remain to be answered, such as the division of property and the relative value 
of assets that each district would be contributing to a unified system. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach, the smallest of the districts with only one school and about 700 
students, had been viewed in earlier discussions as the stepchild that would 
have to be taken in by either of the much larger districts in Redondo Beach or 
Manhattan Beach. But it emerged from the meeting in a potentially strong 
negotiating position as a result of revenue limits. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state funding formula, the tiny district receives nearly $3,200 for 
each full-time student, compared to limits of about $2,500 in Redondo Beach and 
$2,800 in Manhattan Beach. The experts pointed out that Hermosa Beach could 
absorb either or both of the larger districts and contribute its higher revenue 
limit to the new system -- in return for any concessions it might want. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Turcotte, who represented the state Department of Education at the 
meeting, reported several instances in which large school systems have eagerly 
sought annexation by districts with only a few students. 
</P>
<P>
"Districts do covet their neighbors' revenue limits," he said. However, he 
added, the state generally imposes a 10% limit on how much more a new unified 
system can cost the state, compared to the funding received by the existing 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pluses for Unification 
</P>
<P>
Marc Forgy, who represented the county Committee on School District 
Organization, said major advantages of unification generally are "economy of 
scale" -- one board, one administration, one purchasing division and so forth 
-- and smoother "matriculation," a student's transition from eighth grade to 
the freshman level in high school. 
</P>
<P>
The experts also answered a long list of questions on such issues as union and 
administrator contracts, personnel reassignments, responsibility for existing 
legal liabilities and how the "pencils and buses" are divided up if a high 
school district is split between two unified systems. 
</P>
<P>
Turcotte said those problems are worked out by new boards during the transition 
period. "When people get their questions answered adequately, they relax . . . 
and the process goes smoothly most of the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Turcotte said school consolidations can begin either with a citizen petition or 
through action by school boards, but the ultimate decision is made by voters 
and requires a majority vote in all of the affected school districts. The 
process often takes about two years, he said, depending on when it is 
initiated. 
</P>
<P>
He said unifications are going on all over the state, although state government 
stopped pushing for them in the early 1980s. "It's up to the communities and 
what they want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern for Children 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy discussion about the economics of unification, Hermosa Beach 
Trustee Joe Mark wondered: "What's best for the kids?" in terms of the quality 
of education. 
</P>
<P>
The experts ran out of answers at that point, noting that different studies 
have produced different conclusions. South Bay High School District Trustee 
William Beverly suggested that a subcommittee be formed to check out the 
post-unification track records in other areas of the state.

The Palos Verdes Estates City Council awarded a $22,512 contract Tuesday to 
Basmaciyan-Darnell Inc. of Costa Mesa to design Phase III of a troublesome 
intersection near Malaga Cove where Palos Verdes Drives West and North join. 
</P>
<P>
Phase III involves a stretch of Palos Verdes Drive West from Via Corta to the 
triangular intersection. The triangle itself and the curve sloping north to 
Torrance have already been designed. Construction on the curve will begin in 
the next few months, City Engineer Gary Wynn said.

contract, said BDI would favor signal lights at the intersection of Via Corta 
and Palos Verdes Drive West. Ritscher, like several other council members, 
opposes signals in the city. 
</P>
<P>
BDI said plans for the project will be completed in 32 weeks.

NEW FUND TO HELP NEEDY YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In memory of Patrick Cragin, the Fleming Junior High School principal who died 
last month, the Lomita-Torrance Airport Rotary Club has established a Memorial 
Youth Fund to aid needy children in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Money from the fund will be used to help finance some of the club's existing 
youth programs, as well as to start new youth-related projects, said Kendrick 
Ching, president-elect of the club. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Cragin, 48, who was principal at Fleming for two 
years, was working with law enforcement and city officials in the South Bay to 
organize sports and educational activities to keep children off the street, 
Ching said. The fund in his honor will be used to continue such activities for 
children between the ages of 10 and 16, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The club has already received about $2,000 in donations, Ching said. Anyone 
wishing to make a donation or propose a new youth program should contact the 
Lomita Rotary Club, PO Box 578, Lomita, 90717.

SANTA CLARITA BANS FLYERS ON WINDSHIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council has banned the distribution of commercial 
handbills on car windshields. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-handbill ordinance, approved by a 3-2 vote Tuesday night, would impose 
a $50 fine on anyone distributing the handbills on private property without the 
permission of the property owner. A violator could be fined up to $250 for 
repeated violations within one year. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy proposed the measure, calling handbills a nuisance 
and litter problem. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Howard P. (Buck) McKeon and Dennis Koontz voted against the 
ordinance. McKeon said he disliked finding handbills on his windshield but said 
he did not want to limit the ability of small business owners to advertise. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is constitutional because it does not affect non-commercial 
handbills, such as those carrying religious or political messages, said 
Assistant City Atty. Michael Woods. State courts have recognized the right of 
cities to regulate commercial speech, he said.

OPERATION RESCUE MEMBERS CLAIM MOVEMENT IS MISUNDERSTOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a "rescue" of the unborn, participants of the anti-abortion Operation 
Rescue sometimes hold hands, pray, sing, and -- in the case of the Rev. Mick 
McCoy -- cry. 
</P>
<P>
At a demonstration held by Operation Rescue in Los Angeles in February, McCoy, 
pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in El Cajon, said that, while 
others prayed and sang, he was so moved that he "just stood there and cried." 
</P>
<P>
Since its first demonstration in New York City on May 1, 1987, the nationwide 
anti-abortion group has been severely criticized by pro-choice advocates, who 
claim the participants are militants who will use physical and emotional abuse 
to prevent women from getting abortions. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Project Rescue, San Diego's version of Operation Rescue, is 
planning to shut down one or more clinics in demonstrations in the San Diego 
area, but representatives of medical clinics said they will be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injunction Bars Protesters 
</P>
<P>
To discourage anti-abortion demonstrators from blocking entrances to clinics in 
San Diego and elsewhere in the state, officials of the American Civil Liberties 
Union said they have obtained a statewide preliminary injunction aimed at 
barring protesters from medical clinics that perform abortions. The preliminary 
injunction was granted verbally Monday by U. S. District Court Judge A. Wallace 
Tashima in Los Angeles, and ACLU officials said they expect to have the actual 
preliminary injunction before Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary injunction prevents trespassing on the property of medical 
facilities that perform abortions and other family planning services; forming 
blockades; conducting "sidewalk counseling" that waylays people and 
demonstrating within 15 feet of any entrance or exit to facilities, ACLU 
officials said. They said they will ask Tashima to levy fines up to $10,000 for 
violations of the order. 
</P>
<P>
Project Rescue participants have said that, in spite of the preliminary 
injunction, they are still planning their demonstration. "Our position is still 
the same, but the cost has just increased," McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Operation Rescue are more than willing to go to jail for their 
cause, and many refuse to identify themselves to law enforcement officials. 
About 22,000 participants have been arrested across the nation, Operation 
Rescue officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims They're Misunderstood 
</P>
<P>
But McCoy said in an interview that the Operation Rescue movement is a poorly 
understood crusade that seeks to separate itself from anti-abortion militants. 
He conceded, however, that stragglers latch onto their cause to promote their 
own aggressive views. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, other people show up who are not a part of the rescue and use that 
as their protest. They use picket signs and verbal abuse. We ask people not to 
come and do that," McCoy said. "It's also totally untrue that we accuse or 
abuse women. . . . We're trying to protect the children that are scheduled for 
death and prevent women from being exploited in the abortion clinic." 
</P>
<P>
The Operation Rescue movement has not bombed medical facilities that perform 
abortions, McCoy said. "Violence just begets violence." 
</P>
<P>
Will Lehman, 30, of Vista began Project Rescue in San Diego County in October 
when, after worrying about breaking the law, he chained himself to the doors of 
a medical office that performed abortions in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no information on Operation Rescue, but I had heard what happened in 
Atlanta, that a group of pastors and clergy attempted to shut down a clinic 
there in August, 1988," Lehman said in an interview. "At first, I debated over 
whether civil disobedience was a Christian activity, but in the process of 
arguing about it with a friend, it became clear to me that I was wrong. There 
is scriptural basis for Christian disobedience." 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Lehman chained himself to the doors of Dr. George Kung's medical 
office in San Marcos. Lehman also said he was was among demonstrators who were 
arrested Feb. 11 at an Operation Rescue in Sunnyvale, for which he was jailed 
after refusing to identify himself. 
</P>
<P>
Known only as "Baby John Doe No. 4," Lehman spent one month in jail in San 
Jose, entered a plea of no contest, and was given three years' probation. 
Lehman acknowledged that he was breaking the law but, he said, "As it's stated 
in Acts, is it better to obey God or to obey man?" 
</P>
<P>
Rescue demonstrations occur every weekend in the United States, Lehman aid, but 
not all of them are "John Doe rescues." For the demonstration scheduled 
Saturday, Lehman is encouraging abortion foes to bring identification. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators will prepare for Saturday's protest with a Friday-night rally in 
Mission Valley, where the "theology" and an action plan for the demonstrations 
will be discussed. Project Rescue has declined to identify at which clinics 
they plan to protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Concern for the Women' 
</P>
<P>
Through nonviolent means, anti-abortionists at these demonstrations try to 
prevent women from being emotionally and physically scarred, McCoy claims. "We 
have just as much concern for the women as the children. Jesus said (of those 
who killed him), 'Father, forgive them; they know not what they do.' And these 
women don't really know what they're doing to their own child." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations also offer an opportunity for anti-abortionists to "repent 
of their own sins" for the 16-year history of abortion, McCoy said. In 1973, 
the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that Texas resident Norma McCorvey, who filed 
suit as "Jane Roe" in the landmark Roe vs. Wade case, had the right to an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're there to repent because of our guilt in the area of silent consent . . . 
. We're not there to point the finger. We're trying to prevent a murder, not to 
prosecute. That's the thing that attracted me to it. It's an opportunity to 
respond in a way that is not accusing someone else but shouldering their burden 
of guilt," McCoy said.

GOOD AND BAD DECISIONS ON COLLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two decisions by the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees 
were reported side by side (Feb. 13). One, rejecting a request to hold the San 
Fernando Valley Fair on the Pierce College campus, was rational and politically 
brave. The second, to begin construction on Mission College, was wasteful and 
politically expedient. 
</P>
<P>
We must face the fact that in 1947, when Pierce College was opened primarily as 
an agricultural college, the land usage of the western San Fernando Valley was 
decidedly different than it is today. Then it was rural, and much land was 
devoted to agriculture. Today it is suburban residential and that same land is 
devoted to clean industry. And though two-thirds of the campus acreage is given 
over to the agriculture department, less than 5% of the Pierce College 
enrollments are in agriculture. And most of those enrollments are in programs 
unrelated to raising crops, such as floriculture, equitation (a fancy name for 
horseback riding) or veterinary assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The only defensible reason for devoting hundreds of valuable acres to the 
agriculture department is its value as a showplace for elementary school kids. 
If the acreage were converted into a real, working, small farm, it would 
partially justify the immense expense devoted to very questionable educational 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of buildings for Mission College is a blatant case of throwing 
good money after bad. The founding of Mission College was a needless concession 
to a few minority leaders in the area. Pierce and Valley colleges are a short 
drive from the area served by Mission College and they offer a much broader 
curriculum. And if you doubt that there is space available at either Pierce or 
Valley, stroll around the campus between 2 and 7 p.m. and note how many 
students or faculty members you see. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 1960s and 1970s, when there was a lot of money available to 
colleges for the asking, the Los Angeles community college trustees needlessly 
opened the West, Southwest and Mission campuses primarily to appease black and 
Hispanic voters. The district has been spending the time since then trying to 
justify these inane decisions. I call them inane because minority students want 
to go to the best colleges they can, not the closest. 
</P>
<P>
If the 4,800 mostly part-time students claimed by Mission College were 
considered as the equivalent of full-time students, there would be well under 
2,000. That's mighty few students on whom to spend tens of millions of dollars, 
particularly when there is an excellent college less than five miles away 
(Valley) and a second, equally good, about eight miles away (Pierce) in the 
same Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
I look forward to the time when all college boards of trustees make decisions 
based on sound educational practice rather than on political opportunism.

SIMI VALLEY SCHOOLS REQUEST RECOUNT OF GYM MEASURE VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite assurances that last week's election results are accurate, Simi Valley 
school officials on Wednesday formally requested a recount of votes cast for a 
school bond issue that narrowly lost. 
</P>
<P>
Measure B, which had to be approved by more than two-thirds of the voters to 
gain passage, garnered 66.1%, or 6,929 votes, in the March 7 special election. 
It would have provided $8 million to build gymnasiums and an auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth P. Schepler, assistant registrar of voters for Ventura County, said the 
measure lost by 59 votes. She called the recount "an exercise in futility" and 
said the county's results are accurate. 
</P>
<P>
But Lew Roth, president of the Simi Valley Unified School Board, said that "as 
long as an outside chance exists that some of the 'no' votes could be converted 
to 'yes' votes, we feel obligated to give it a try." The school board voted 
unanimously Tuesday to ask for the recount. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping our fingers crossed," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
The board has hired Peter Bagatellos, a San Francisco attorney specializing in 
election law, for about $1,500 to supervise the recount, Roth said. In 
addition, the school district will pay $160 per day to the county for the cost 
of elections technicians' time, Schepler said. 
</P>
<P>
The recount, which is scheduled Friday, is expected to take about a day, 
Schepler said. 
</P>
<P>
A second school bond issue, Measure A, passed last week with 70.5%, or 7,410 
votes -- more than the necessary two-thirds. The measure will provide $35 
million for new heating and air-conditioning systems for the district's 27 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials campaigned aggressively for both bond measures. A 
citizens committee supporting the measures recruited more than 200 volunteers 
and raised more than $6,000 to hire a political consultant and pay for other 
campaign expenses.

UNIMPRESSED BY SKID ROW 'ESCAPADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading "Candidate Walks Mean Streets" (Feb. 11), I was left with the 
feeling that City Council candidate Paul McKellips' behavior is more 
exploitative of the homeless people than it is helpful. While I admire his 
creativity and fortitude, I find the substance of his escapade merely a clever 
stunt designed to bring media attention to his campaign effort. 
</P>
<P>
If this is not the case, why wasn't his descent into the life styles of the 
poor and unfortunate carried out amid the increasing numbers of homeless people 
right here in the 3rd District? It may be surprising to many that this part of 
Los Angeles has an alarmingly large and increasing population of homeless 
people. Mr. McKellips didn't need to travel all the way to downtown. He could 
have had his experiences right in his own back yard -- behind the Vons store in 
Reseda (though I do realize it's harder at that spot to find a newspaper 
reporter and photographer on their way to work at City Hall). 
</P>
<P>
I'm glad that Paul's experience has showed how much he takes for granted his 
own good fortune in life. But I'm angered by his inference that people pursuing 
issues such as Warner Ridge and light rail shows only their concern for their 
"wants and desires." Mr. McKellips needs to realize that these people are 
fighting to preserve the good things in their lives, things they've worked long 
and hard for. The reason they are willing to work so hard to prevent the 
destruction of their quality of life is simple. They don't take what they have 
for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't a day that passes that I don't wake up or go to sleep thinking how 
lucky my wife, baby and I are to have what we do. And there isn't a day that 
goes by that I don't consider the possibility that next month we could be 
joining the ranks of the homeless. And now a day won't pass that when I see a 
homeless person, I won't think of the $51,000-a-year executive who showed his 
naivete, exploited a horrendous human dilemma and criticized his fellow humans 
all while trying to satisfy his own "wants and desires" of getting a seat on 
the City Council. Shame on him.

As a homeowner who has been trying to save 10% of water usage every year and

If you have the money, build waterfalls and swimming pools and more high-rises

2 MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TAKE APPLES OFF MENU 
</P>

Two more San Diego County school districts have refused to serve apples to 
students because of a chemical scare, but one elementary school district has 
put the fruit back on the menu after receiving assurances from the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture that the apples are not contaminated, authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 17,000 students in the Alpine Union Elementary School District and 
the Oceanside Unified School District will have to go without apples, apple 
sauce and apple juice as administrators await government test results on 
whether the apples are contaminated with daminozide, a chemical used to control 
ripening. 
</P>
<P>
But 16,000 students in the Cajon Valley Union Elementary School District will 
find apples on the lunch menu March 22 and 28. San Diego Unified school 
district -- the second-largest in the state, with 117,000 students -- is also 
continuing to serve apples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Canned Products on Hold 
</P>
<P>
Linda Patzold, Cajon Valley director of child nutrition, said she found out 
Wednesday from representatives of the Department of Agriculture that the apples 
there hadn't been sprayed. Patzold said she will await further test results 
from the government, however, before serving canned apple slices, apple juice 
and apple sauce. 
</P>
<P>
In Alpine, Charlotte Becker, director of food services, said: "We're holding 
stock. With all the publicity, I just thought it was better to wait." 
</P>
<P>
Bonsall Union Elementary, Borrego Springs Unified, Encinitas Union Elementary, 
Fallbrook Union Elementary, Lemon Grove Elementary, South Bay Union Elementary, 
Sweetwater Union High and Valley Center Union Elementary school districts have 
stopped serving apples after a recent report by the nonprofit, Washington-based 
Natural Resources Defense Council that said daminozide can cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside Unified district Supt. Steven Speach and the board of education 
decided Tuesday night to pull apples from school lunch menus until more 
information can be obtained, according to Tom Mackin of the district's food 
service department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Actions Called Premature 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said the report has been misinterpreted and only 5% of the 
nation's apple crop is treated with Alar, a brand name for the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many chemicals out there that cause cancer. The toxicity of a 
chemical is based on exposure as well as its potency," said Evan Siegal, 
supervising toxicologist of state Department of Health Services' food and drug 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
Siegal added that there is no proof that Alar causes cancer in humans. "We do 
not feel that the theoretical risk is high enough to justify even the removal 
of apples or apple products from the market or from school lunch programs." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Kizer, director of the state Department of Health Services, told 
reporters in Los Angeles on Tuesday that school-district actions to remove the 
fruit have been premature. 
</P>
<P>
"While we are still reviewing the NRDC report for its technical validity, it's 
important to understand that the theoretical risks associated with consuming 
trace pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables pale in comparison to the 
risks of not eating enough fruits and vegetables," Kizer said.

Jack Clark, who has spent the spring rejoicing over his return to the National 
League as a first baseman for the Padres, paused briefly Wednesday to issue a 
farewell address to American League friends. 
</P>
<P>
"The umpires over there are awful, they don't have a clue . . . I don't know 
whether they don't practice or what," Clark said of American League umpires 
after being ejected by the AL's Tim McClelland following a disputed 
third-strike call in the sixth inning of the Padres' 11-3 exhibition victory 
over Oakland at Phoenix Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Bad umpires is maybe the biggest reason I'm glad I'm back over here (NL)," 
Clark continued in even tones. "There's a lot of bad umpires over there (AL); 
that's why Billy Martin kicks dirt on them, trying to cover them up." 
</P>

Clark's only kicks at McClelland Wednesday were verbal. After arguing a called 
third strike in the fourth inning, Clark became incensed in the sixth after 
another call put him down one ball and two strikes. He then cursed McClelland. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'I'm glad I never have to see you (expletives) again,' " said 
Clark, who spent his first season in the AL last year with the New York Yankees 
after spending most of 13 years in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"Yep," McClelland confirmed. "He cursed me." 
</P>
<P>
But Clark was not thrown out until after the next pitch, a high, outside 
fastball that was also called a strike. Clark dropped his bat at the plate, 
flung his helmet and walked off as McClelland shot his fist into the air with 
the ejection. 
</P>
<P>
"That pitch was in the dugout. I think Honeycutt (A's pitcher Rick) was almost 
laughing." Clark said. "They've got a lot more low-lifes umpiring over there 
(in the AL), a lot of scabs. They must have a code of ethics where they all 
stick together, like collusion. See today, the guy can run back and tell his 
friends -- guys like (AL umpire) John Shulock, he's the absolute worst -- tell 
them, 'Hey, I got Clark for you.' 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the AL umpires are jealous of the NL umpires. I think a lot of them get 
their jollies throwing out million-dollar ballplayers." 
</P>
<P>
McClelland, who listened to Clark's comments just as calmly, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have notches on our belts, we don't want to throw guys out, it's more 
of an aggravation to us," McClelland said. "And there's no difference to us 
between a million-dollar ballplayer and a rookie. We don't even notice who is 
up there. When the ball is coming 90 mph, you don't have time to notice who's 
batting. You're just trying to call balls and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's absolutely no difference between the umpiring in the two leagues. 
Absolutely none." 
</P>
<P>
Clark begged to differ. 
</P>
<P>
"I've notice the difference, and it's not just in the strike zone, it's in the 
quality of umpires," Clark said. "I think they try so hard to be different from 
the National League. I've always thought umpiring was just umpiring, no matter 
what." 
</P>
<P>
As Clark was finishing his discourse in the clubhouse underneath Phoenix 
Stadium, in walked pitcher Bruce Hurst. In five innings, he had allowed two 
runs on five hits with five strikeouts but had looked distressed on some close 
ball and strike calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Who had a longer day, me or you?" Hurst asked Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, it was McClelland who issued a normally calm Hurst one of his 
two major league ejections, in Game 3 of last year's American League 
Championship Series. Although Hurst was not pitching, he was upset because he 
claimed McClelland had laughed at him during an argument in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm arguing over something else from the dugout, and I ask him, 'Why don't 
you laugh at me now?' " Hurst recalled. "So he threw me out, and I gave him my 
hat, my coat, my glove and told him, 'Take all this, you've already taken away 
my game.' " 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else Wednesday, the Padres, who have cruised through the first 24 
days of spring training doing little more than preening and shaping, finally 
found emotion. Two batters after Clark's ejection, catcher Benito Santiago hit 
his second homer of the game, a shot over the left-field fence that Santiago 
admired before defiantly celebrating by tossing his bat near McClelland's feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I think, maybe I should run, what if the ball goes down -- bloop -- 
inside the fence?" Santiago said. "That happened once in Las Vegas, I think I 
have homer, I was thrown out at second base, I not play for three days. This 
not happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Following this, the game became so captivating that Manager Jack McKeon was 
able to pull off the move of the spring. In the eighth inning, in the middle of 
leading his team in another cheer, McKeon sneaked out of the dugout and into 
the clubhouse, where he quickly showered and changed and caught a van for the 
airport and a flight to San Diego. The Padres ended their 10-game Phoenix trip 
here and with an off day today, they weren't required to report back to Yuma 
until Friday afternoon. Not even McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an awesome move, I think I was the only one who saw him," Tony Gwynn 
said. "He was clapping and saying 'C'mon guys, c'mon guys' and then -- boom -- 
he's gone.' " 
</P>
<P>
McKeon missed the game's biggest blow, as struggling prospect Sandy Alomar Jr. 
hit a ninth-inning grand slam off Eric Plunk. It was Alomar's second hit in 18 
spring at-bats. The Padres hope it gets the attention of the league's scouts, 
who have been looking at the Padres' chief bit of trade bait with interest. The 
closer they have watched, the more Alomar, 22, has squirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally think now, I can be the Sandy Alomar of last year and the year 
before," Alomar said. "I can be me." 
</P>
<P>
And hopefully for him and the Padres, he can then be gone. McKeon spent much of 
the pre-game workouts in conversation with New York Mets scout Harry Minor, who 
has followed the club throughout the spring. Trade talks could be heating up 
between those two clubs; the Padres would send Alomar Jr. to the Mets for 
center fielder Len Dykstra and infielder Howard Johnson. Alomar Jr. is also 
being watched closely by the Yankees, who might be persuaded to send the Padres 
third baseman Mike Pagliarulo. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres leave Phoenix with an 8-4-1 spring mark and begin a nine-game "home 
stand" at Yuma's Desert Sun Stadium beginning Friday at 7:05 p.m. MST against 
San Francisco. That game will be telecast back to San Diego on KUSI-TV Channel 
51, with the pregame beginning at 5:30 p.m. . . . Outfielder John Kruk missed 
Wednesday's game with a sore neck, which he twisted when he broke up a double 
play Saturday against Seattle. "It's been every little thing with me this 
spring," lamented Kruk, who was sporting a new wavy haircut. "It's a new 
hairstyle," he said. "It's called a comb." . . . On Wednesday Bip Roberts was 
once again misidentified as "Biff," this time on the Phoenix Stadium 
scoreboard. Unfortunately, until Jack McKeon quits calling him "Biff," the 
infielder has little reason to complain to anyone else.

HINZO TRIES TO IMPRESS INDIANS -- AGAIN 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bright blue and red of the Cleveland Indians is generously splashed around 
the Hi Corbett Field complex here, glowing from the railings, walls and 
doorways. The colors mix with the casual spring training atmosphere to keep the 
mood loose and light. 
</P>
<P>
It is precisely the kind of mood that Tommy Hinzo is trying to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
He was loose last year. He took things lightly last year. And he was shipped to 
Colorado Springs (triple-A) at the end of spring training. A bright spot in 
Cleveland the year before at second base, there was no Indian summer in 1988 
for Tommy Hinzo. He spent the entire season in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a year after his demotion, Hinzo, a Hilltop High School graduate, is 
trying to rebuild his path to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy has an outstanding attitude this spring," Cleveland Manager Doc Edwards 
said this week. "He realizes that when he's here, he will be here to stay. 
We're not putting the proverbial cart in front of the horse." 
</P>
<P>
Hinzo may not stick with Cleveland this spring, but at least the horse is 
catching up. A year ago, Hinzo was complacent when he should have been hungry. 
And it cost him. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw an attitude this spring when he first showed up," Edwards said. "When 
you see someone in training camp with a lot of fire in their eyes, and then you 
don't see it the next year, it's a big change. Sometimes we don't see things in 
ourselves, and I bet Tommy didn't last year. But this spring, I saw it again. 
Believe me, it's a big change. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, Tommy Hinzo was a man who was able to recognize an 
opportunity, harness it and climb aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Known once as Touchdown Tommy, he set rushing records at Hilltop when football 
was his favorite sport. But he was a standout on the baseball diamond as well, 
and his father and Hilltop Coach John Baumgarten both told him he could make a 
career in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
He took his talents to Southwestern Community College, after which he moved on 
to Tucson and the University of Arizona -- where he played for the 1986 College 
World Series champions. It wasn't the last time Tucson, a town tinted 
red-and-blue by the Arizona Wildcats as well as the Indians, would serve as a 
setting for his baseball pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's No. 7 pick in the June 1986 draft, Hinzo was in the majors a year 
and a month later. He was 23 and went two for five on July 16 against the White 
Sox in his first big league game. He teamed with shortstop Jay Bell to form the 
youngest double play combination in Cleveland history. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last spring, Hinzo's career took an abrupt turn south. The red of Tommy 
Hinzo's red-hot rise to the majors faded into the blue of a lost opportunity. 
One line in the transactions column, and he was blown out of town. 
</P>
<P>
What happened was what happens to a lot of young players. Hinzo's ego advanced 
a little more rapidly than his game. He became a little too cocky. 
</P>
<P>
And a serious lesson was about to be learned. 
</P>
<P>
After playing 67 games in Cleveland in 1987, Hinzo figured he had it made. He 
was young and talented. He had started the season at Kinston (A), was promoted 
to Williamsport (double-A) in June and called up to the Indians in July. 
</P>
<P>
A leap such as that in one season, from A ball to the majors, is almost unheard 
of. Hinzo did it. But then he had to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Mexico to play winter ball in 1987, hurt a knee, sprained a thumb 
and returned home. His doctor told him to take it easy, and that was all Tommy 
Hinzo, Cleveland Indian second baseman, needed to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what I did," he said. "I came into camp fat and out of shape. 
It was just terrible. It got time to start working, and it was a little too 
late. I was that bad out of shape. I figured I was planted, and there was 
really nobody there to contend with as far as someone to beat out for a job. I 
figured as long as I played defense, the job would be mine. 
</P>
<P>
Something else Hinzo didn't plan on was Julio Franco's desire to move from 
shortstop to second. Franco is a solid major leaguer with a .295 career batting 
average, and Edwards began to listen to Franco's pleas when he saw Hinzo's 
overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We held Julio off as long as we could, trying to evaluate whether we'd be 
better off with Julio at shortstop and Tommy at second or Julio at second and 
Bell at shortstop," Edwards said. "Bell had a better attitude than Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
Call it a major league learning experience for Hinzo. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy wasn't so much out of shape last year as he didn't have the right 
approach," Edwards said. "He had always had the right approach to the game, and 
I think what happened to him last year happens to a lot of young people who 
have success early. He forgot his priorities." 
</P>
<P>
So the Indians sent him away. He started well at Colorado Springs, batting 
around .270 midway through the season, but finished the season batting just 
.232. And the man known for his defense made 19 errors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like I was on a mission in the beginning," he said. "But then I didn't 
get called up . . . I just didn't go about things business-like." 
</P>
<P>
In one of life's little ironies, the road led him through Tucson again. The 
Colorado Springs Sky Sox finished the season here last summer, and as Tommy 
Hinzo drove home to San Diego after the final game last August, he did a lot of 
thinking. He thought about 1987, when he was the Indians' second baseman. He 
thought about how quickly he had come in so little time. And he decided that if 
he was going to make his living at baseball, he had better start acting like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Edwards: "The good ones bounce back and are usually better ballplayers 
because they never forget the (minor league) experience. The guys who aren't 
winners are doing you a favor because they don't bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
Spring is a time for beginnings rather than endings, so the ending of the Tommy 
Hinzo story is yet to be written. He has had a good camp both offensively and 
defensively, batting .350 with no errors. But the Indians were so unsure of him 
over the winter that when they traded Franco to the Texas Rangers, they picked 
up another second baseman -- Jerry Browne. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't going to trade Julio without acquiring another second baseman," 
Edwards said. "We didn't know how Tommy would be this spring. You don't know a 
man's approach until a man shows up." 
</P>
<P>
Hinzo attacked this winter with more determination than ever. He worked out at 
Hilltop five days a week, taking 200 swings and 200 grounders a day. He also 
bulked up on a weight program. He's around 190 pounds now, but it's muscle 
instead of fat. 
</P>
<P>
But it may take him longer than he would like to erase the damage of last 
spring. He's battling Browne for the second base job and, while Edwards isn't 
saying, it appears Browne has the inside track. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Browne has had an outstanding spring," Edwards said. "Outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Browne is a veteran of parts of the 1986 and 1988 seasons with Texas as well as 
a full-season in 1987, when he batted .271. 
</P>
<P>
"You do have to weigh (the experience) factor," Edwards said. "Someone who hit 
.271 in a full season as opposed to someone who hit .265 in half a season." 
</P>
<P>
The scouting report reads nearly the same on Browne and Hinzo: good range, good 
speed, turns the double play well, average at the plate. But Browne has the 
edge in experience. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Aguayo, a seven-year veteran signed by Cleveland as a free agent this 
winter, has a lock on the utility infielder role. So Browne and Hinzo are not 
only battling for the starting second base job; they are battling for a roster 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jerry Browne is the starting second baseman, I will not carry Tommy Hinzo," 
Edwards said. "He won't sit on the bench. He is too young and needs to play 
every day. But I have a good feeling that if something happened to Jerry 
Browne, Tommy Hinzo would be right there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hinzo: "I don't know. Last year I took things for granted. I vowed I 
wouldn't let it happen again. I'll be up there sometime this year." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spring training continues, and the reds and blues continue to glow 
in the sweltering sun at Hi Corbett Field. The first cuts will be made in 
Tucson later this week.

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: LESLIE'S FOULS WORRY MORNINGSIDE IN TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas

<TEXT>
<P>
Morningside arguably has the most dominant girls basketball player in the state 
in 6-5 center Lisa Leslie. The problem for the Lady Monarchs, at least in the 
postseason, has been keeping Leslie out of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
It's become one of the concerns of Morningside Coach Frank Scott as his team 
prepares to meet Oakland Fremont in the state Division I championship game 
Saturday night at 6:15 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
In seven Southern Section and Southern California Regional playoff games, 
Leslie has fouled out twice and been forced to sit out lengthy parts of four 
other games after picking up early fouls. She sat out most of the second and 
third quarters Saturday night in Morningside's 45-44 win over Point Loma in the 
regional final. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to her about it," Scott said. "If the officials are going to call 
it one way, she has to try something else because we need her in the ballgame. 
When she's in the game it creates a different atmosphere because the other team 
has to worry about her." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside suffered from Leslie's absence Saturday. After opening a 17-0 lead, 
the Lady Monarchs struggled when Leslie was benched with three fouls early in 
the second quarter. Point Loma rallied and pulled within 30-27 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Leslie was rarely in foul trouble during Morningside's sweep 
through the Ocean League, Scott reasons that inconsistent officiating has hurt 
her in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the officials in our league let a lot of things get by," he said. "In 
the playoffs you get better officials who are going to spot these things. . . . 
As big as she is, officials are going to see her first. Some of the calls have 
been questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Scott is stressing to Leslie that she needs to become more 
cautious on defense, where she has picked up most of her fouls. He realizes 
Morningside can ill-afford to lose her 27 points, 14 rebounds and seven blocked 
shots a game with the state title on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Morningside's success in the playoffs, Scott has been unable to 
devote any time coaching the Monarch baseball team. Assistant Thomas Robinson 
is coaching until Scott returns. 
</P>
<P>
Scott knows it's not a good situation for a program that has struggled in 
recent years, but he says there is no alternative because of the overlapping 
seasons and a lack of baseball coaches at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to find another (baseball) coach," he said. "But the job doesn't 
pay that much, so it's hard to find takers." 
</P>
<P>
Scott's absence has forced Morningside to forfeit its junior varsity games 
because Robinson, the JV coach, is handling the varsity. Scott plans to take 
next week off and will begin coaching the baseball team "a couple of days" 
before Ocean League play starts March 29. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, it might be difficult for the Monarchs to improve on last 
year's 6-14 record and last-place finish in the league. They took a 1-1 record 
into today's non-league game at Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard's baseball team will bring a 30-game league winning streak, the 
second longest in Southern Section history, into its Camino Real League opener 
Saturday at Bosco Tech. 
</P>
<P>
With five more wins, the Vikings can break the record of 34 straight Moore 
League victories by Lakewood from 1973 to '76. St. Bernard, which was 14-0 in 
the Camino Real League each of the last two years, has not lost a league game 
since falling to Cantwell, 5-4, in 13 innings in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The players are aware of it," said Coach Bob Yarnall, who has guided St. 
Bernard to a 40-2 league record in three years. "They know (the streak) has 
been passed on since 1986. They don't want to disappoint the previous players 
on the team." 
</P>
<P>
If the Vikings keep the streak going, they can set the record April 12 against 
Serra. That's one game before they meet El Segundo, considered St. Bernard's 
main challenger for the Camino Real title. 
</P>
<P>
Yarnall says his players are looking forward to that meeting. This is El 
Segundo's first year in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to stop at 35," he said. "We want to beat El Segundo." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne sprinter Curtis Conway didn't pass up an opportunity to take the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test last weekend, even though he was in Maryland to run in 
the National Indoor Track Championships at the Naval Academy on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time Conway has taken the SAT. He needs to score 700 in order 
to accept a football scholarship from USC. The All-Southern Section quarterback 
signed a letter of intent with the Trojans in February. 
</P>
<P>
After taking the test Saturday at an Annapolis area high school, Conway went 
out the next day and helped the Cougars set a national prep record of 1:28.25 
in the 880-yard relay. Conway ran the anchor leg in 21.5 seconds as Hawthorne 
established the school's fifth national record. 
</P>
<P>
Conway also turned in an impressive anchor time of 47.6 in the mile relay. 
Hawthorne took third in 3:23.3. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Hawthorne athletes performed well in the meet. Anthony Smith ran 21.6 
on the second leg of the record-breaking 880 relay and long jumped 24-4 1/2 
while Eric Tolbert posted a lifetime-best mark of 55-4 in the shot put. The 
Cougars competed unattached because of Southern Section rules. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood's Harold Miner, considered one of the most versatile basketball 
players in the South Bay, did nothing to hurt his reputation by taking second 
in the school's senior spelling bee. 
</P>
<P>
The USC-bound swingman led the area in scoring this season with a 29-point 
average. Finishing close to Miner were two of his Bay League rivals -- Torrance 
guard Rick Robison (28.6) and Rolling Hills center John Hardy (27.7). 
</P>
<P>
Hardy was named the league's most valuable player, while Miner and Robison were 
chosen co-most outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Lisa Leslie, a junior whom many consider the premier prep center 
in the country, became the first Morningside player named to the Parade 
All-American first team. Forward Shaunda Greene, the 1988 Southern Section 5-A 
Player of the Year, was the first Lady Monarch selected a Parade All-American. 
She was a third-team choice last season. . . . Left-hander Victor Darensbourg 
allowed six hits and struck out 12 Tuesday to lead Westchester to a 9-4 win 
over Venice in a Coastal Conference baseball opener. It was the first loss for 
Venice (5-1), which won the Red Division title of the Westside Tournament last 
week. . . . Freshman shortstop Grant Hohman continued his hot hitting for St. 
Bernard by driving in four runs Tuesday in a 23-2 non-league victory over 
Murphy. Hohman, who bats cleanup, leads the Vikings with eight RBIs and entered 
the week hitting .467. . . . Mira Costa (3-0, 1-0 in Ocean League) remained No. 
1 in the Southern Section 4-A volleyball coaches poll this week. The Mustangs 
play host to North Torrance at 7:30 tonight in a key Ocean match. . . . Artesia 
captured the championship of the El Segundo Baseball Tournament with a 6-3 win 
over Westminster on Saturday night.

match-up. Loyola is averaging a collegiate-record 112.8 points, and Arkansas is 
averaging 99.8 over its last seven games -- all of which it has won by at least 
10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams press to force tempo and turnovers and try to outrun opponents. 
</P>
<P>
If it becomes a road race, note that few teams in the last two seasons have 
outrun the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone is capable, it might be the 24-6 Razorbacks, who appear to be deeper 
and quicker than Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
It may also be a question of attrition. Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson 
consistently plays 10 men. Loyola Coach Paul Westhead has used an eight-man 
rotation much of the season but goes into the tournament without his best 
athlete, Enoch Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons will watch the game with a cast on his left hand and several surgical 
pins in a broken knuckle, suffered in the Lions' victory over Santa Clara in 
the West Coast Athletic Conference tournament. Simmons' absence takes 18.7 
points from the Lions' attack and, more importantly, changes Westhead's 
substitution patterns. 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight has been on scoring stars Hank Gathers, Jeff Fryer and Bo Kimble 
for much of the season, but Simmons' injury at the key position in Westhead's 
system casts the playoff glare onto Tom Peabody, Terrell Lowery and, perhaps, 
Terry Mister. 
</P>
<P>
Peabody, who started 20 games when Kimble was injured, will open in Simmons' 
point guard spot and will also play other positions. Lowery, a talented 
freshman who sometimes has turnover tendencies, is the backup point guard and 
will have to handle Arkansas' trapping pressure. And Mister, a sophomore who 
played capably early in the season but has played little since the start of 
conference play in early January, may be called on to spell Peabody and Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead, however, says his 20-10 team is "more explosive" offensively than 
last year's 28-4 squad that won a 119-115 NCAA opener against Wyoming, and he 
professes confidence in the altered lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"We've inserted Tom Peabody into the point, and we're revving up Terry Mister," 
he said. "I'm very confident Tom can give us 20-plus minutes at the point guard 
position. He's our utility player, so we won't be using him exclusively at the 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers said practices have gone well without Simmons: "We look very sharp with 
Tom Peabody. I like the way he pushes the ball. We don't expect a lot of points 
from Tom, but he'll get it into everyone's hands, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
He also has to keep it out of the quick hands of the Razorbacks. Several 
coaches compare Arkansas favorably to Oklahoma and Illinois, teams that have 
been ranked No. 1 at times this season. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Coach Tom Penders, whose team was ripped by Arkansas, 100-76, in the 
Southwest Conference finals, said, "They have unbelievable ammo. They could go 
a long way in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Penders compared Arkansas guard Keith Wilson to the Sooners' Mookie Blaylock, 
who bedeviled the Lions in December. The 6-2 Wilson is one steal away from 
tying pro star Alvin Robertson's school season record of 92. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa Coach J. D. Barnett compared Arkansas to Illinois in athletic ability. 
"Arkansas may have the best athletes in the country, at least even with 
Illinois," said Barnett, whose team played both. 
</P>
<P>
The three-pointer may also be a decisive factor. Loyola leads the country in 
three-point shooting, averaging 9.3 per game. Arkansas doesn't rely on the 
three-point shot but tries to take it away from opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, which shoots its three-pointers off the run, like Loyola, was held to 
eight attempts and made only one in the SWC championship. If the Razorbacks 
swarm Fryer and Kimble, the Lions may need outside shooting from Per Stumer, 
Peabody and Lowery to open things up. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola likewise offers challenges for Arkansas. "We've never played a team we 
have to try to slow down," said Richardson, who likes to call his approach 
run-and-execute as opposed to Westhead's style -- shoot first and ask questions 
later. Richardson also said the Razorbacks "have got to do something" about 
Loyola's ability to get the ball down court and in the basket in four or five 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Look for a match-up zone Richardson learned from Villanova's Rollie Massimino. 
Richardson's team plays it with more quickness and extends farther from the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
It may come down to which team can impose its style on the other, or pull off 
an offensive explosion. Call it the Westhead System vs. Hogball. 
</P>
<P>
Gentlemen, start your engines.

DIGEST: SURGERY MAY END SEASON FOR CLU'S LEONHARDT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Leonhardt, a sophomore second baseman at Cal Lutheran and the team's 
leading hitter with a .390 average, underwent surgery on the middle finger of 
his right hand earlier this week and is expected to miss the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Leonhardt broke his finger when he was hit on the hand by a line drive last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Brouelette will replace Leonhardt at second base. 
</P>
<P>
Former Pierce College outfielder Sebastian Goodlow has signed a free-agent 
contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and will report to spring training in 
Vero Beach, Fla., on March 29. 
</P>
<P>
Goodlow, who attended Centennial High in Compton, batted .350 in 1987 and .279 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Former Sylmar High standout Dana Ridenour was among 13 players sent Tuesday to 
the New York Yankees' minor league complex at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for 
reassignment. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour, 23, had been promoted to the Yankees' 40-man major league roster in 
November after spending three seasons in the team's farm system. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ridenour spent time with the Columbus (Ohio) Clippers of the 
triple-A International League and Albany-Colony (N.Y.) Yankees of the double-A 
Eastern League, compiling a 6-6 overall record with 14 saves. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Ridenour was named the Yankees' minor league pitcher of the year after 
posting a 5-4 record with a 1.77 earned-run average with the Ft. Lauderdale 
Yankees of the Class-A Florida State League. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus High will stage a basketball tournament next season on Dec. 1-5, and 
Coach John Clark is looking for teams. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley, Canyon and St. Genevieve are already scheduled, and Clark is 
hoping to attract as many as 14 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Chiprut, 15, a student at Montclair Prep, finished second in the 
all-around class in a qualifying meet of the Southern California Gymnastics 
State Championships in the senior advanced optional division. 
</P>
<P>
Chiprut also placed second in the uneven bars and floor exercise and finished 
sixth on the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Leonard, 11, of Sepulveda, won the vault, uneven bars and balance beam to 
claim the all-around title in a qualifying round in the advanced optional 
division for gymnasts aged 9-11.

ERMA BOMBECK: LET'S GET ON WITH LIVING -- FREE OF GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My mother told me the other day (with a straight face) that an 83-year-old 
woman at a Weight Watchers meeting slowly approached the instructor afterward 
and said, "Tell me again what I'm not supposed to eat." 
</P>
<P>
That is the most depressing thing I've heard all year. 
</P>
<P>
When does it stop? Isn't there ever a time when we can accept the principle of 
gravity and get on with our lives? How many years do we have to choose between 
an olive and three days of serious bloating? How long can a woman be expected 
to live by the old adage: The shortest distance to water-pill thinness is a 
straight line to the bathroom? 
</P>
<P>
Two women were talking in aisle 4 of the supermarket a couple of days ago. I 
overheard one say, "Isn't it a shame Liz Taylor is putting it back on?" One of 
the women had three chins and the other couldn't see her shoes for the 
overhang. I wanted to say, "I heard the horse she rode in 'National Velvet' has 
gone to pot too!" My God, when is the public going to give this woman 
permission to be 57 years old and in charge of her own life? 
</P>
<P>
Who cares if Oprah had a hamburger or if the grease dripped off her elbows? Or 
if she eats both ears off a 6-foot-tall solid chocolate bunny? Fans want their 
idols to stop the clock. They don't want to see Barbara Walters wear glasses, 
Raquel Welch become a grandmother or Angie Dickinson with gray hair. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know the logic, but it probably has something to do with the public's 
own mortality. They're the same age and they could look that good if they had 
money. They don't make those same kinds of demands of public politicians, 
authors, artists, musicians or corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon recently, I quietly observed four women at the next table. 
Between all the lifts, tucks and nips, there was enough skin and fat left over 
from the four of them to make a fifth person. All of them sat around with a 
surprised look on their faces. If the stock market crashed, not one of them 
could have blinked an eye, let alone express emotion. 
</P>
<P>
It occurs to me there should be some kind of correlation between your mind and 
your body. What does it profit a 78-year-old woman to sit around the pool in a 
bikini if she cannot feed herself? Or to have your face lifted and not remember 
who took it? 
</P>
<P>
There's a compulsory age for everything in this country. You are told when to 
receive Social Security, to retire, to reach adult status, to drink alcohol, 
vote and enter the first grade. 
</P>
<P>
Is it too much to ask, "When am I old enough to pig out?" without having to 
fall on your knees and confess, "Bless me, Jean Nidetch, for I have sinned"?

ART BUCHWALD: ALOFT WITH THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is your Eastern Airlines pilot, Capt. 
Frank Lorenzo, welcoming you aboard our flight from Miami to Anchorage, Alaska, 
for $3. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be cruising at an altitude of 35,000 feet, but because of expected 
turbulence from striking Eastern employees, we may have to land in Ft. 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
"Please fasten your seat belts while we taxi on to the runway. Since our 
disloyal pilots are refusing to cross the greedy mechanics' picket line, our 
co-pilot on this flight is Sam Harris, who handles lost luggage complaints for 
Continental Airlines. Will the flight attendants take their seats? 
</P>
<P>
"We are now at 15,000 feet and I am going to turn off the no-smoking sign. If 
you look out of the window on the left side of the aircraft, you will see 
hundreds of pickets waving signs at decent Americans who have no use for 
unions. If you look out of the right side, you will see thousands of people 
waving papers. Those are my lawyers making sure nobody stops anyone from 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't appreciate what is needed to run an airline. It takes money, 
which you have to borrow at very high rates. It also requires knowledge of the 
merger business and how to sell off the assets of one airline to pay for 
another. Union members can't understand that. Their only concern is feeding 
their families. The employees don't give a hoot about what happens to 
entrepreneurs like us. This country will never get back on its feet until it 
has respect for those of us who watch the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"I am about to turn on the 'No Strike' sign to warn the stewards and 
stewardesses it is against FAA regulations to carry placards up and down the 
aisles while we are in flight. Ladies and gentlemen, the cabin crew will now 
begin selling beverages. We would appreciate it if everybody bought $30 worth 
of liquor to help keep Eastern flying for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Now hear this. This is Capt. Lorenzo speaking again. We hope that you are 
enjoying the flight. As you probably heard before leaving Miami, Eastern will 
no longer supply meals to passengers. You can blame this on our 35,000 striking 
employees who could care less if our passengers starve to death. If you don't 
like this any more than I do, write to the Bush Administration. Almost everyone 
there is a good friend of mine. 
</P>
<P>
"We are flying over Niagara Falls and we have a treat for you. We are going to 
show 'Labor Unions and How They Destroyed America.' This is a tough, 
hard-hitting film that depicts the decline of the labor movement, and how one 
man decided to break the stranglehold that the working class had on his 
airline. There will be a $6 charge for head phones. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This is Capt. Lorenzo. We hope that you enjoyed the movie. If you would like a 
videotape to take home with you, the cost will be $99. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of you have asked what are the issues in this strike now affecting all of 
us. They are as much about power as they are about money. I want power and my 
employees want money. When I started running airlines I discovered that it is 
impossible to have power if you give money to the workers. I know how to 
operate a damn good airline but I can't do it if the employees have their hands 
out all the time saying, 'gimme, gimme, gimme.' There has to be some way of 
carrying on a business without paying people. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen, apparently my strike-breaking tactics are not working, 
so I am going to demand the resignation of three of the cabin stewardesses and 
request that they turn in their uniforms immediately. Eastern will never forget 
their loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Capt. Lorenzo speaking to you once more. At this moment we are flying 
over Montana and seem to be out of fuel. I am asking all the passengers to 
fasten their seat belts so that I can declare bankruptcy and let the courts 
worry about whether we are going to make it to Alaska or not."

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was supposed to speak to the Res 
Publica Board of Governors and Claremont McKenna College supporters in the 
Tiffany Room of the Biltmore last Thursday, but the reservations just kept 
pouring in, and finally McKenna President Jack Stark moved the luncheon to the 
Biltmore Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The justice sat at the head table with Donald Russell of Newport Beach, 
chairman of Res Publica (Latin for public affairs) CMC's premier fund-raising 
group. At the same table were Marian Miner Cook (who gave the Athenaeum at 
Claremont), Maggi Craig, Ralph Rossum, Jack and Jil Stark and Edward Gould, 
whose family foundation, the Shirley and Benjamin Z. Gould Family Foundation, 
last week gave $2 million to put the college's $50-million capital campaign 
over the top. 
</P>
<P>
ESCALATION: Anne and Kirk Douglas will be in the spotlight Friday at the 
Ritz-Carlton in Rancho Mirage. The event is the Palm Springs Desert Museum's 
spring gala, and the couple will be honored for their contributions to the

<P>
To the World Children's Transplant Fund and its president, Mark A. Kroeker, 
L.A. Police Department deputy chief, at the receiving line for a cocktail 
reception at the Music Center hosted by Mark Wittcoff, president of the 
Spinnaker Foundation. . . .

</P>
<P>
TWENTIETH: The Founder's Circle of the Right to Life League of Southern 
California moved from Chasen's to the California Club to celebrate its 20th 
anniversary. Ann Blyth McNulty, Patrick and Geri Frawley, Dorothy and John 
Shea, Clair and Gil Shea and Sally and Paul Conn were among those sitting 
around the soaring tulip and forsythia bouquets and hearing from Gloria 
Griffin, chairman, Licia Nicassio, assistant chairman, the Rev. Donald 
Merrifield, S.J., Walter Trinkaus and Timothy Cardinal Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the participating committee were Jane Ackerman, Patty 
Burschinger, Kathleen McCarthy and Jane Sullivan. When the evening was over, 
the crowd wouldn't part. They headed for the television in the bar for the 
basketball finale between Santa Clara and Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
PLAUDITS: To Richard Van Voorst, president of the USC Alumni. At the Alumni 
Awards Dinner at the Century Plaza, the top accolade -- the Asa V. Call 
Achievement Award -- went to philanthropist Ronald Stever. Merit awards went to 
architect Frank Gehry, Los Angeles chief administrative officer Keith Comrie, 
astronaut Col. Charles Bolden, author James Dobson and president of the Seoul

</P>
<P>
To William H. Nolan and Courteny Marculescu, receiving Lifetime Achievement 
Awards from Five Acres, the Boys and Girls' Aid Society of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
MIDAS TOUCH: Diane Becket and Beverly Cruse must have a Midas touch. They 
cozily squeezed 850 ladies and 50 Trojan gentlemen into the International 
Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton for the USC Town and Gown scholarship benefit 
(150 students will receive scholarships from a fund totaling $500,000 this 
year). 
</P>
<P>
Then they asked Rod Dedeaux, USC's all-time winningest baseball coach, to 
discuss golden moments. (Largely because of him baseball will be in the 1992 
Barcelona Olympics.) 
</P>
<P>
Then they turned to couturier Nolan Miller for a "Golden Dynasty" fashion show 
of his newest fashions plus a run-through of his starry stuff that has been 
worn by Linda Evans and Joan Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan husbands were prominent and included Don Becket and Marcel George 
(husband of Town and Gown president Joanne George). Chairman Becket brought out 
her Alpha Phi sorority sisters in droves: Joan Puddy, Joy Sabol, Jean Bowman, 
Allison Blackman, Eileen Maloney, Tracy Hirrel and Kathy Richards. 
</P>
<P>

 YOUR COINS: CLOCK'S VALUE MAY BE JUST SENTIMENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: For our silver anniversary, my mother gave my husband and me a 
special clock in which the numerals were replaced by coins. Each coin 
represented pertinent dates in our lives, such as birthdays and anniversaries. 
My mother has passed on and I am wondering if I should insure the clock. Could 
you please tell me if these coins are valuable? U.S. dimes: 1887, 1889, 1898, 
1923; U.S. dollars: 1922. -- M.H.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Coins make wonderful gifts. United States mint sets and proof sets can 
help commemorate births, weddings and various anniversaries. For the most part, 
they are relatively inexpensive unless the dates are in the early '50s, '40s 
and down to 1936, where you're talking big bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, gold coins are often given as gifts because of the dates. They can 
be given in presentation cases or fashioned as jewelry. Keep in mind that coins 
made into jewelry will likely lose their numismatic value due to wear, so only 
circulated pieces should be used for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing holds true for your anniversary clock. I'm sure a lot of thought 
went into the clock as a gift. But the dates of the coins you mentioned in 
their denominations are considered common. Also, they probably have been 
damaged to a certain extent by the way they've been handled. So, as far as your 
question concerning insurance is concerned, I doubt that it's necessary. 
</P>
<P>
There's only one way to know for certain, however. Coins must be seen to be 
accurately graded and appraised. Take your coins to a local dealer or 
professional numismatist. If insurance is warranted, they'll let you know by 
the value they place on your anniversary clock. I suspect, however, the 
sentimental value will outweigh any collector value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a 3-cent piece dated 1853. On one side are the words United States of 
America and the date. On the other is a C and III with a bunch of stars on the 
perimeter. The coin is in fair condition, worn but everything is legible. Could 
you let me know what it's worth? -- G.H.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: Three-cent silver coins were issued from 1861 through 1873; there are also 
3-cent nickel coins from 1865 to 1889. Your coin (the silver type) is worth 
about $5. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Thanks to one of your columns last year, I went through my collection of 
quarters and found five stamped 1964, one dated 1776-1976; plus a $1 stamped 
1900. I am a little excited and wonder what the value of these coins might be. 
-- M.P.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, now, just simmer down. Your 1964 quarters are worth about $1 each, the 
1776-1976 is a Bicentennial commemorative worth face value; and the silver 
dollar is $8 to $10 and up, depending upon condition. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1976, the Royal Canadian Mint began issuing a commemorative gold coin 
once a year. So far, 12 such coins have been issued. The 1985, commemorating 
the Canadian National Parks, has what I believe to be the lowest mintage, 
59,745. Now, the $5 gold Statue of Liberty uncirculated has a mintage of more 
than 90,000 but commands a higher premium than the lower-mintage Canadian 
piece. What's even more surprising is that the Statue of Liberty has only about 
a quarter of an ounce of gold, while the Canadian coin has exactly half of an 
ounce of gold. In your opinion, would you consider this 1985 Canadian gold coin 
a rare item with good investment potential? -- R.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: You're getting into a very speculative area, and I don't like to speculate. 
Especially on modern issues. But 59,745 is not rare. It is perhaps scarce, but 
then only if 59,746 collectors are interested. 
</P>
<P>
The market will be determined by supply and demand. It is also dominated by 
Americans who primarily buy American coinage. You have to decide what your goal 
is in collecting. If it's for profit, you're in a highly speculative area. But 
if you like these modern coins because of their designs and the history that 
surrounds them, then by all means be a buyer. With any luck, enough people will 
agree with you and the profit potential will follow.

Just in time for St. Patrick's Day is a commemorative marking the 1,000th 
anniversary of the establishment of Dublin and the liberation of Ireland from 
the Vikings. The 5-ounce silver piece (pictured) designed by Ceasar Ruffo 
depicts a battle scene on the obverse and Dublin's motto, Baile Atha Cliath 
(the Town of the Hurdle-Ford) on the reverse. No more than 5,000 of the proof 
pieces will be minted. The commemoratives are $95 from Putnam Mint, 100 Putnam 
Green, Greenwich, Conn., 06830; telephone (800) 227-1205. 
</P>
<P>
The lavish 473-page catalogue for the Four Landmark Collections is now 
available. The auction will be held in seven sessions at the Vista 
International Hotel in New York from March 27 to March 31. Among the highlights 
is an 1824/4 overdate $5 gold piece, one of only two known. For catalogues, 
contact Bowers &amp; Merena, Box 1224, Wolfeboro, N.H. 03894. 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of grading services in the last few years has generated a 
whole new industry. So-called slabbed coins (sealed in plastic and graded by a 
neutral entity) have taken many collectors by storm. The Professional Coin 
Grading Service, one of the leaders, recently certified its millionth coin. For 
information, contact PCGS at P.O. Box 9458, Newport Beach, Calif. 92658; 
telephone (714) 250-1211. Also popular is the Numismatic Guaranty Corp. of 
America, which has added a hologram to its holders, a security measure. NGC has 
a dealer network. For information: P.O. Box 1776, Parsippany, N.J. 07054;

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: SELECTED POKER CHIPS A GOOD BET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I collect items from gambling establishments here -- such as in 
Nevada -- and abroad, such as in London and Monte Carlo. I particularly have a 
large collection of poker chips from European clubs going back half a century 
or more. Do they have much value? -- F.W. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We have seen individual chips -- properly authenticated as to age and 
gambling house -- listed for $50 or more. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that collectors at the entry level cannot round up a wide 
assortment of gambling-related items at reasonable prices. In this category 
would be card decks, dice, books on the subject, casino ashtrays and signs. 
Little wonder, then, that there is growing collector interest in this colorful 
field. 
</P>
<P>
As for your poker chip collection, many collectors mount them the same way coin 
collections are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
Serious collectors say they keep a communications line open to casino officials 
so that they have an opportunity to purchase old inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Among magazine collectors, National Geographic has always been a favorite. In 
the March, 1989, issue, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the National 
Geographic Society, notes that "people have always found it difficult to part 
with National Geographics." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he says Dr. Lew Begley of Mesquite, Tex., has about 400,000 copies 
of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"These individuals are among hundreds of collectors who share a passion for our 
magazine," he writes. "Belonging to no association or formal network, they 
trade news on the whereabouts of rare issues, such as the flag number of 
October, 1917, with its 1,197 color drawings of the world's flags, or the 
mushroom issue of May, 1920, treasured by botanists for its detailed paintings 
of fungi." 
</P>
<P>
The rarest issues are those published before 1910. Of these, Grosvenor says: 
"The earliest issues, they tell me, have become rather expensive. A 
well-preserved copy of October, 1888, (Vol. 1, No. 1) might be worth $10,000."

A PAINTER RECALLS THE REIGN OF TERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

Memoirs of Madame Vigee Lebrun, translated by Lionel Strachey (George 
Braziller; $24.95; 233 pages) 
</P>
<P>
For an unlikely story of prosperity in unpromising circumstances, consider 
Louise Elisabeth Vigee Lebrun. 
</P>
<P>
At 7, she tells us in her memoirs, she insisted on covering her school books 
and classroom walls with drawings. When her father saw them, "He went into 
transports of joy, exclaiming, 'You will be a painter, child, if ever there was 
one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now this was 1763. Even a painter father, such as the elder Vigee, would not 
normally welcome a daughter into the trade with such enthusiasm. Granted, he 
was witty and unconventional, and so was his daughter. Both chatted up their 
sitters as they painted, giving them, in her case at least -- his portraits 
have not survived -- a fresh look, as if they themselves were about to think of 
something witty to say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father Encouraged Her 
</P>
<P>
Vigee pere firmly supported his daughter's vocation until his death, when she 
was 12. His colleagues continued the encouragement. At 15, she was already in 
demand at the court in Versailles. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, she remained a successful painter of kings and nobles all her 
life. Considering that she died at 86 -- in 1842 -- and considering the 
convulsions that France and much of Europe went through, this was remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
If you are in the business of painting faces, it is a real problem of supply 
and demand to have the guillotine remove them so drastically. Mme. Vigee never 
got over the French Revolution, though she survived it by knowing when it was 
time to hop a stagecoach and head for the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
She found work in Catherine the Great's Russia. There, an Ancien Regime really 
knew how to take care of itself. Later, she moved to England and returned to 
France once Napoleon was firmly in charge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote of Court Life 
</P>
<P>
Buoyancy and self-confidence mark the memoirs of this woman, whom the sun 
tended to shine on with the help of some shrewd meteorological positioning. She 
writes, with a pleasure that approaches innocence, of the beautiful people, 
their parties, their clothes and how much they liked her. Once in awhile, 
though, darkness breaks through. The guillotine left its shadow. 
</P>
<P>
At two points in this abridged version of the Memoirs -- it is a reissue of the 
selection made and translated in 1903 by Lionel Strachy -- Mme. Vigee produces 
a graphic and unalloyed moment of pain. In contrast to her rosy-fleshed 
portraits, she is painting bone. 
</P>
<P>
One of these is an unsettling comment on the report that Mme. Du Barry, Louis 
XV's mistress, struggled and cried for mercy as she was put on the guillotine 
block. There was a moment of shocked hesitation; the other victims had 
generally made a point of showing serenity. 
</P>
<P>
If the others, Mme. Vigee muses, "had not had the noble pride of dying with 
fortitude, the Terror would have ceased long before it did." 
</P>
<P>
More chilling is her account of the last court ball at Versailles. By this 
time, some of the nobility were distancing themselves from Louis XVI and Marie 
Antoinette, and expressing tentative sympathy with the early ideas of the 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Partners for Queen 
</P>
<P>
Mme. Vigee writes as compact and vivid a detail as we have of how the bottom 
fell out of a world. The queen was unable to get any of the younger courtiers 
to dance with her. "Their refusal likened a sort of revolt -- the prelude to 
revolts of a more serious kind." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of this book is as revealing. There is a bland, even gushing quality to 
many of the painter's descriptions of the high, if insecure society she moved 
among and lived off. 
</P>
<P>
A more active editing job might have compensated for the rather unfocused 
effect. Although a foreword by John Russell helps, it would have been useful to 
have more in the way of dates; and at least a few footnotes giving a historical 
context for some of Vigee's stories. And the reader should be told that this is 
an abridgment, not the full Memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
There are some good moments, nevertheless. Mme. Vigee would flatter the mighty, 
but only up to a certain point. One of her aristocratic sitters kept pursing 
her lips to make her mouth look smaller. Finally, the painter offered to do her 
without a mouth at all. Louis XVIII, proud of his voice, would sing while 
posing. Did she think he sang well? he asked. "Like a prince," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spent Time in Russia 
</P>
<P>
Her description of the lavish scale on which the Russian nobility lived is 
striking; these were untamed feudal barons in contrast to the domesticated 
courtiers of Versailles. Count Stroganoff, for example, employed an orchestra 
in which each musician was assigned a single note, which he repeated each time 
it came up. It was a human music box; a grotesque masterpiece of cultural 
autocracy. 
</P>
<P>
To function, however, the Russian empire needed its share of practiced and 
skillful officials. The most memorable was Prince Bezborod, secretary of state 
for foreign affairs. Wherever he went, he was deluged by requests, and he 
perfected two consummate bureaucratic retorts. To those who asked a favor, he 
invariably replied: "I shall forget." To those who sought to fortify his memory 
by handing him a written petition, he would say: "I shall lose it."

BACK LOT IN L.A.'S BACK YARD

<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, Lustig is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If more local scenes seem to be showing up on television and movie screens 
lately, it's not an optical illusion. The San Fernando Valley's share of 
on-location filming has increased about 5% over the last five years, to about 
one-fifth of the work being done in the Los Angeles area today. 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of a dozen location managers -- people who scout streets 
and buildings for the movie industry -- reasons for this increase include the 
area's chameleon-like looks, lower daily production costs, cooperative 
residents and the fact that the area has not been overexposed, like other parts 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more here than there once was. People are definitely rediscovering the 
Valley," said Geoffrey Ryan, a location manager who has been in the business 
for 15 years. On any given day, as many as 10 film crews can be seen on Valley 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Stanley of Wheeler Location Services, one of a number of firms that files 
on-location shooting permits for motion picture companies, said she has noticed 
a steady increase in the number of Valley permits since the writers' strike 
ended in August. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley, like others in her business, has heard grumblings about the difficulty 
of working downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation here is first-rate; the school administration couldn't be more 
helpful," Ryan said. He transformed a Van Nuys High School into one in Merced 
for "I Know My First Name Is Steven," a TV movie in production for Lorimar. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has transformed restaurants on Ventura Boulevard into ones in Dallas, and 
the Sepulveda Basin into a helicopter airfield outside New York City for 
"Escape From New York." He made the broadcast headquarters for the futuristic 
TV series "Max Headroom" out of the Warner Center Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting beaten to death in this town," said Ryan, who like his peers, 
wants to see as much movie production as possible stay in Los Angeles, "but we 
get beat up less out in the Valley than downtown." 
</P>
<P>
To location managers, "beat up" means uncooperative residents and expensive 
location costs. Since the cost of a shooting permit, which can be issued for 
various amounts of time, is the same one-time rate of $115, it is other 
expenses -- such as parking and making deals with homeowners for use of their 
property -- that have many production companies considering Valley sites 
whenever applicable. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial settings in space-precious downtown Los Angeles and surrounding 
areas, production people say, can hover around $3,500 per day, with an 
additional $3,000 a day in parking lot rentals for crew cars and equipment 
storage. A similar setting in North Hollywood might go for $1,500, with $200 
for parking, which is sometimes tossed in free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Fees 
</P>
<P>
To shoot "I Know My First Name is Steven" at Van Nuys High School, the 
production company paid the mandatory $1,000 fee to the L.A. Unified School 
District, then voluntarily contributed $750 per shooting day to the school's 
student body. The crew's vehicles were parked across the street in a church 
parking lot for $250 per day. Ryan said he would have had to pay at least 
$2,500 a day for the same parking downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a valid reason to charge what they do," Ryan said, citing the 
congestion and increased demand for usable space downtown, "but it's less 
expensive out here. Down there, everybody's got their hand out." 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago you'd go up to some guy's home in Beverly Hills or Hancock Park, 
say you were going to show up tomorrow, and give him a couple hundred bucks," 
said Brian Brosnan, a location manager for 10 years. "But now everyone's so 
film-savvy, it's not a couple hundred dollars, it's $5,000." In the hills of 
Encino, Brosnan said, the going rate for using an expensive home in a scene 
might be about $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could go to a homeowner that has never had filming done before and make a 
much better deal than going into Beverly Hills, I'm a hero with the producer," 
Brosnan said. "And if the production designer is happy with the look, great." 
</P>
<P>
Location manager Kristin Dewey, who once made Van Nuys High School look like an 
Eastern seaboard prep school for an unsold TV pilot, also likes to use San 
Fernando's Whiteman Airport when the script calls for a small airstrip in rural 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey, who has been at her job for four years, is always looking for a new 
street to film on. "There are houses and neighborhoods that have never had a 
film crew on them," she said, pointing out stately new homes in Northridge, 
Chatsworth and Bell Canyon that she could use rather than going back to Hancock 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey, like Ryan, cited cooperation as another reason for the Valley's 
popularity. "The people are much more apt to be enthusiastic about the 
shooting," she said, "there's more room for your equipment, and you don't have 
to pay $3,000 just to park your crew and trucks." 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much more that can be done here," said Ricky Frazier, a movie 
location manager for 11 years, comparing the area to other parts of Los 
Angeles. "On film, this isn't just the San Fernando Valley, it can be 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Most location managers say the Valley profits by the overexposure of downtown, 
Hancock Park, Hollywood, Pasadena and South Pasadena. Others also appreciate 
the reception they receive here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
North and South 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Frazier's search is typical. When looking for an upstate New York farm 
scene for "Guts and Glory, the Oliver North Story," a miniseries due to air in 
May, he found it in Chatsworth. When he needed a home to match one at Camp 
Lejeune, N.C., a suitable substitute was found in Studio City. Another house in 
the area masqueraded as one near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
And since the viewing audience can get tired of seeing palm trees in every 
show, "anywhere" is important to budget-conscious film makers. Location manager 
Gary Dorf said there is an ever-present demand for generic locations that are 
"well-groomed but not ostentatious homes and office suites that are accessible 
and logistically workable. Certain areas of the Valley fill that bill." 
</P>
<P>
But most of the location managers felt on-location shooting anywhere, whether 
it be in the Valley or other parts of Los Angeles, has become a more difficult 
proposition over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is more sophisticated," said Ryan. "There's no location manager who 
is going to explain that we're not going to have any impact on daily life. 
People are too smart. But they're much easier to deal with in the Valley then 
downtown, no comparison."

ONE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL THAT REALLY WORKS

Minuteman Tech, a regional, vocational-technical high school in the western 
Boston suburb of Lexington, is a far cry from the old image of a vocational 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
Minuteman looks more like a high-tech office park than a school. Here, in a 
futuristic brick and glass building, is a small city of real-life businesses 
providing students with work skills: two student-run restaurants (one serving 
grilled salmon with hollandaise), hair salon, fully equipped garage, child-care 
center, gift shop and bakery. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the school grounds, students hammer pink insulation into a 
state-of-the-art model house. 
</P>
<P>
Minuteman is where David Healy went after his disastrous high school 
experience. "It gave me confidence," he says. Healy entered Minuteman as a 
postgraduate adult student and did a straight 2-year vocational program. He's 
now working on his bachelor of arts and teaching there two nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the students in the neglected majority are just as bright, but they 
learn in a different way," says James Amara, science department head at 
Minuteman. "They're hands-on learners, not book learners." He says Minuteman 
presents information in three forms: visual, auditory, and hands-on. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which opened its doors in 1974, has 850 students (including adults) 
who come from 16 towns in the district. Tuition-paying students come from 
another 15 towns. The school turns out engineers, hotel managers, printers, 
beauty salon owners, day-care operators, commercial artists, plumbers, and 
more. Some of the school's tech-prep students have gone on to Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Purdue 
University. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to getting state support, the school goes after grants and is 
promoting links with local industry. And there's an eager world of work out 
there ready to snatch up grads. 
</P>
<P>
"There are five to six part-time jobs waiting for every student in the culinary 
field," the assistant superintendent says. And an auto mechanics teacher says, 
"One grad started working at a car dealership. It wasn't 6 months and the boss 
is having him do all the trouble jobs and asking me, 'Got any more like him?' "

<P>
In the 1960s, the San Diego pop scene produced a handful of musicians and 
singers who made it to the top of the charts, breathed in the rarefied air of 
national fame, then descended as quickly as they had risen. 
</P>
<P>
 So where are they now? Whatever became of the members of such local 
flashes-in-the-pan as the Cascades and Gary Puckett and the Union Gap when the 
hits stopped coming, the fans stopped screaming and the agents stopped calling? 
</P>
<P>
 Of the local pop scene's famous alumni, a few still live in San Diego. Some 
continue to play music in bars and nightclubs; others are working as mechanics, 
waiters and schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
 While fame and fortune may have been fleeting, memories die hard -- and talk 
of the present invariably drifts to nostalgic recollections of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first in a three-part series on San Diego's once and, who knows, 
possibly future pop stars. 
</P>
<P>
 He no longer goes to work wearing lacy shirts and tight pants and instead dons 
yellowed T-shirts and greasy overalls. Instead of plucking bass strings, his 
fingers tighten wrenches. Instead of riding around in limousines and fancy 
sports cars, he fixes them. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years after his San Diego rock band, the Cascades, topped the 
national pop charts with "Rhythm of the Rain," Tony Grasso is the service 
manager of the Horsman Chevron station at Mission Gorge Road and Magnolia 
Avenue in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Grasso, now 47, took the job a couple of years ago, he said, after struggling 
for more than a decade to make a living as a professional musician after the 
Cascades' 1974 breakup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the most money in the world, but I live good, I'm home and I'm 
basically doing what I want to do," Grasso said. "I miss music horribly, but to 
go out there and have to dicker with somebody for $50 a night, it's just not 
worth it, it's not worth the frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, it's very, very difficult for a musician to sustain himself 
playing clubs. On the road is where you make your money, but, after spending so 
many years on the road, I just didn't want to do that anymore. I met somebody 
very special, and I wanted to stay home, in one spot, for a change. 
</P>
<P>
"And, since I couldn't stay in San Diego and support myself playing music, I 
pretty much had to get into something else." 
</P>
<P>
Grasso was born in Syracuse, N.Y., and raised in Tucson, Ariz. He took up the 
accordion at age 8. 
</P>
<P>
"My father taught me how to play guitar, and, as time went on, I earned my way 
through high school and college, playing music with various rock bands," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Grasso said that, shortly after he moved to San Diego in 1962, he was hired to 
play bass with the Cascades, then a popular local bar band. In the fall of that 
year, the group signed with Valiant Records, a Warner Bros. subsidiary. One of 
the first songs it cut was "Rhythm of the Rain," which propelled the group to 
instant stardom. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing caught me by surprise," Grasso recalled. "One day we were 
working dumpy nightclubs in town; the next day, all these large agencies wanted 
to book us (on national tours), and everybody was saying, 'Hit record, hit 
record, hit record.' 
</P>
<P>
"We had no concept of what all this entailed," he said. "We had been told that 
this was going to happen and that was going to happen, but the reality of it is 
never really there until you're in the middle of it. So, when success came, it 
was so alien to us that we didn't know what to do with it. We made a fortune, 
but we also spent a fortune; we were young and stupid, and a lot of money 
sifted through that was never accounted for." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 1960s, Grasso said, was a "very frustrating time" for the 
Cascades. While the success of "Rhythm of the Rain" kept "the jobs readily 
available, and the money high, for a long, long time," there were no further 
hits, he said. And, eventually, the Cascades found themselves reduced to plying 
the oldies circuit, performing in tiny nightclubs and Las Vegas lounges before 
a steadily diminishing legion of fans. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the group -- which by then had become the house band at the Red Coat 
Inn in East San Diego -- broke up. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally realized we were getting older," Grasso said, "and that we could no 
longer compete in the rock 'n' roll 
</P>
<P>
department with all these guys who were 20, 22 years old. Still, I never felt 
(playing music) was a dead horse -- just that there were other avenues we 
should pursue." 
</P>
<P>
In Grasso's case, this meant putting together a Las Vegas-style show band 
called Sweet Seasons, which he toured with in the Western United States for the 
next six years. 
</P>
<P>
"Conceptually, we were what I would have liked to have seen the Cascades evolve 
into," Grasso said. "Unfortunately, we didn't have the name, and we didn't have 
the hit, so, instead of doing the kind of music I wanted to do, we had to play 
whatever happened to be 'in' at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"And what was in during the late 1970s was disco," he said. "I loathed it, but, 
in order to survive, I had to play it." 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, Grasso had had enough. He returned to San Diego, got married, and 
spent the next six years playing country music in local nightclubs, mostly in 
the East County. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always loved country music, since that's what I was raised on," he said. 
"But the local market just isn't big enough, and, while I had a lot of work, 
the money just wasn't there. So eventually, I got tired of beating my brains 
out against the wall for less than $500 a week and decided the time had come to 
either go back out on the road or stay home and drop out of music entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Grasso chose the latter -- and today, he said, he has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate to say that I would never return to music, but it would have to 
be a situation that's as financially lucrative, and as musically satisfying, as 
the Cascades once were," he said. "Anything short of that, I'd much rather 
continue working as a mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was very young, I had worked in the automotive business; I liked it 
then, and I like it now."

Carol Black and Neal Marlens, the couple behind ABC's Emmy-winning series "The 
Wonder Years," will be stepping down as executive producers at the end of this 
season. They will turn over the reins to Bob Brush, currently co-executive 
producer. Marlens and Black plan "to take a rest" and pursue feature film and 
TV projects. Staff writer Dave Stern acknowledged that the impending change has 
"rattled the chemistry a bit" behind the scenes, but expects that Brush and the 
staff will maintain the show's integrity. "They are the ones who created these 
characters, and we're not going to do much to change the show," he said. "There 
will just be a new man in charge." ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO; 
</P>
<P>
2 JAZZ GROUPS COMPETE FOR FUNDING FROM CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Each year, the city of San Diego disburses a big pot of money to local arts 
organizations from the tax charged on local hotel rooms. Among the nearly 80 
groups receiving support last year were the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company 
($148,000), the Horton Plaza Theatres Foundation ($274,000), the La Jolla 
Chamber Music Society ($31,000), the La Jolla Playhouse ($120,000), the San 
Diego Master Chorale ($9,000), Installation Gallery ($20,000) and the San Diego 
Opera ($300,000). 
</P>
<P>
Jazz, too, received backing, but barely enough to do a handful of decent shows 
by local musicians. The San Diego Jazz Festival was the only jazz organization 
funded; it took home a whopping $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the city has another chance to show how much it cares about jazz, as 
it gives out about $5 million from the bed tax fund. The San Diego Jazz 
Festival, a nonprofit group that went through some lean years but is back with 
a board of directors who help it gain financial support, is asking for $25,000. 
It would present a series of free local concerts at a variety of locations. 
</P>
<P>
Submitting a very similar idea is the newly named San Diego Jazz Society, 
formerly the North Coast Jazz Society, which wants $5,000 -- also for a series 
of free concerts, primarily in downtown San Diego and Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The two organizations try to seem tolerant of each other, but there's 
apparently no love lost. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say about the San Diego Jazz Festival is more power to them, but I 
don't think they have a lock on presenting jazz here," said John Lawrence, head 
of the society. "In fact, they were defunct for two years." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lawrence's group applied for money but didn't receive any. He was 
told a "North Coast" organization couldn't be funded, so he changed the name to 
"San Diego." Hence, the new "San Diego Jazz Society," which could easily be 
confused with "San Diego Jazz Festival." 
</P>
<P>
"If I chose to be annoyed, I could be," said Al Rubottom, president of the San 
Diego Jazz Festival's board. "They've changed their name from North Coast Jazz 
Society, which they are, except for a concert at the Educational Cultural 
Complex last year, to San Diego Jazz Society, which confuses people. That will 
further dilute people's perception of who's doing what; that's unfortunate. Our 
efforts over the years to promote jazz and the awareness of a local nonprofit 
organization have been a tremendous critical success and financial hardship. 
Someone else waving the same banner is welcome in theory, but what typically 
happens is goals become confused to other people, to the arts commission." 
</P>
<P>
Rubottom is referring to the city's new 15-member Commission for Arts &amp; 
Culture. This fiscal year, for the first time, it will recommend to the San 
Diego City Council which arts organizations should be funded and at what 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the best of all worlds would be for both jazz groups to receive 
money. But there is no way to predict which directions the commission will 
lean. None of its members, appointed by the mayor, are direct participants in 
local jazz, nor do any of them jump out as major supporters of the music. The 
City Council makes all final decisions, and Rubottom doesn't see much cause for 
optimism there, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we've got any allies to speak of on the council," he said. "I 
haven't heard from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
For $30,000, both the jazz society and the jazz festival would get what they 
want. And we'd all get some great music. Out of $5 million, that doesn't seem a 
lot to ask of the council when it makes its final decision in June. 
</P>
<P>
There are more sparks between San Diego's yuppie jazz stations than you'll 
usually get from their musical lineups. Elario's is the latest prize in the war 
between "The Wave," KSWV-FM (102.9), and KIFM (98.1). After receiving offers 
from both stations, the jazz club has joined with KIFM to present "Jazz at 
Elario's" Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
This is great news for local fans of mainstream jazz. It means that KIFM will, 
for the first time, be promoting concerts by artists like Kenny Burrell, Kenny 
Barron and Joe Pass. The first KIFM night at Elario's March 8 drew an 
enthusiastic crowd to hear guitarist Burrell with Tommy Flanagan on piano. 
</P>
<P>
In almost any local music store, you won't have trouble finding albums by the 
popular jazz musicians featured on local commercial radio. But finding a copy 
of an album like "Live at Fat Tuesday's," the newest from jazz pianist Kenny 
Barron, is another matter. Tower Records on Sports Arena Boulevard doesn't have 
it. Neither does The Wherehouse in Encinitas. Lou's Records in Encinitas, a 
small but very hip store, had a few copies but sold them all. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, the records don't seem to be available everywhere," said 
Barron, who opened a two-week stay at Elario's last night. "When ENJA (his 
record label) entered into a distribution agreement with MUSE, I thought things 
would be better, but it hasn't turned out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Barron, who's played with people like Lee Morgan, Stan Getz, Buddy Rich, Ron 
Carter, and Tony Williams over the years, laments the lack of a viable club 
scene in cities across the nation. He's taught at Rutgers for 17 years to 
support his artistic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, he'll tour Europe with sax player Stan Getz, who's helped 
awaken his interest in Brazilian music. 
</P>
<P>
"Aside from the rhythms, which are infectious, their approach to harmony is 
very interesting, the way they move chords," Barron said. "It's quite different 
from North American."

In March, a competitor of the San Diego Jazz Festival was quoted in this column 
as saying that the San Diego Jazz Festival had been "defunct for two years." 
Although the San Diego Jazz Festival did not present shows between July, 1987, 
and October, 1988, while it underwent financial and administrative changes, the 
organization (originally the La Jolla Jazz Festival) has operated continuously 
since 1979.

LIONS, RAZORBACKS READY TO RUN IN MIDWEST REGIONAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount's Coach Paul Westhead is portraying his basketball program as 
the upstart going against an established power, Arkansas, in the opening round 
of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament today. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, that's accurate. Arkansas was a perennially strong team in the 
late 1970s and the early 1980s under Eddie Sutton, and the Razorbacks regained 
their prominence in the Southwest Conference this season. Loyola, meanwhile, is 
making only its third tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Lions and Razorbacks meet at 11:30 a.m., PST, in the Midwest 
Regional at the Hoosier Dome, they will take the court on relatively equal 
footing. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead and Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson are veterans, each in his fourth 
year at his current position, each making a second straight tournament 
appearance. Arkansas (24-6) has the better record but is a relatively anonymous 
team whose best players are mostly underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (20-10) has one of the country's best players in junior center Hank 
Gathers, the nation's scoring and rebounding leader. The Lions have received 
their share of national publicity by leading the country in scoring the last 
two seasons. Last season, Loyola won its tournament opener, beating Wyoming, 
while Arkansas lost to Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
The teams play a similar style, so a high-scoring game -- perhaps approaching 
last year's 119-115 shoot-out against Wyoming -- is expected. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas, which plays a 10-man rotation, appears deeper than the Lions, who are 
without injured guard Enoch Simmons. Westhead has generally used eight players. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Peabody, who started 20 games when Bo Kimble was hurt, moves into Simmons' 
spot but won't match Simmons' 18.7-point average. The pressure may also be on 
reserve point guards Terrell Lowery, a freshman, and little-used sophomore 
Terry Mister. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' broken hand, suffered in the West Coast Athletic Conference 
tournament, means that Gathers, averaging 32.6 points and 13.6 rebounds; Jeff 
Fryer, 22.9 points, and Kimble, 16.4, must approach their averages and be 
effective from three-point range to get their 22nd 100-point game. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks are extremely quick and press to force the pace, much as Loyola 
does, although Richardson said he may not press as much as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to speed those guys up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson starts only one senior, ball-hawking guard Keith Wilson, but has 
several of the nation's top freshmen, starting 6-7 forward Todd May and 6-2 
guard Lee Mayberry, who has been compared to former Arkansas star Sidney 
Moncrief. Mario Credit, a 6-9 junior, starts at center but 6-9, 260-pound 
freshman Oliver Miller plays about as much. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's other key player is 6-4 junior forward Lenzie Howell, the 
conference tournament MVP. Howell is averaging nearly 20 points and 10 rebounds 
in the last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas, which doesn't depend much on the three-pointer, averages nearly 90 
points and is riding a seven-game winning streak during which it has averaged 
99.8 points and won by an average margin of 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Those statistics make Loyola's players smile. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're playing a running team, I think it works in our favor," Kimble said. 
"It's going to be a crazy game. I'm glad we drew a team that likes to run."

BEN JOHNSON STEROID INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
ISSAJENKO DOES NOT RULE OUT SABOTAGE

Despite suggestions to the contrary Wednesday by Ben Johnson's attorney, 
Canadian sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko reiterated her previous testimony 
that Johnson was aware he had used anabolic steroids and other banned 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that Johnson's positive test for a steroid, stanozolol, after he 
had won the 100 meters in the 1988 Olympic Games still confuses her because she 
does not believe that he used that particular drug within a year of competing 
in Seoul. Doctors say that stanozolol normally clears the system within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Although she previously had told the Canadian government's commission of 
inquiry into drug use by athletes that she no longer believes Johnson was 
sabotaged, she testified Wednesday that she thinks it was scientifically 
possible for Waldemar Matuszewski, the Canadian Olympic track team's physical 
therapist, to have purposely rubbed stanozolol into Johnson's system during a 
massage in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish-born Matuszewski, known as Magic Hands to the athletes he treated, 
worked extensively with Johnson, Issajenko and other athletes coached by 
Charlie Francis for more than two years before the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Ed Futerman, Johnson's attorney, Issajenko said that 
Francis, who testified last week that he could not rule out Matuszewski as a 
possible saboteur, suggested a possible motive in a telephone conversation with 
her husband, Tony Issajenko, a few days after returning from Seoul last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband said Charlie felt it was most likely Waldemar because he had a 
tendency to bother Charlie and the other athletes for money from time to time," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborating later in response to a question by Futerman about whether Johnson 
trusted Matuszewski, Issajenko recalled a meeting among Francis' athletes at a 
training camp last summer in Verona, Italy. She said that Matuszewski had 
wanted 5% to 10% of the athletes' earnings. They rejected his demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We all agreed we didn't like that characteristic in Waldemar," she said. "If 
we gave 10% to everyone who felt he deserved something, we wouldn't have had 
any money left." 
</P>
<P>
Matuszewski will not comment until he is called by the commission to testify, 
his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Futerman was the 10th attorney Issajenko faced Wednesday, her third and final 
full day of testimony. She will return to the witness stand briefly today, 
followed by her husband, a former sprinter who also was coached by Francis. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic moment Wednesday occurred not during testimony but when 
Issajenko's rival of almost a decade, Canadian sprinter Angela Bailey, entered 
the hearing room and sat down near the back. During a brief pause, Issajenko 
and Bailey stared at each other, not averting their eyes until the questioning 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, outside the hearing room, Bailey said that she will ask the 
commission for an opportunity to testify. Often a runner-up to Issajenko in the 
100 and 200 meters at the Canadian national championships, Bailey publicly 
accused Issajenko of drug use on several occasions. Issajenko testified that 
she began using steroids in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of hearing from dirty athletes," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she told the Canadian national coach, Gerard Mach, and other 
officials about her suspicions in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to keep my mouth shut," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Issajenko said that she had received death threats from 
unidentified telephone callers who did not want her to testify about Johnson's 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, she had told reporters that Johnson did not use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"When an athlete is caught, that's the standard procedure," she said. "You 
deny, you deny, you deny. If the inquiry hadn't been called, we'd be denying to 
this day. But once the inquiry was called, I knew we'd have to come out with 
the truth. It was over." 
</P>
<P>
Asked during cross-examination by Futerman whether it was possible that Johnson 
did not know that he was using steroids, she said, "No, sir." 
</P>
<P>
"OK," he said. "That's your opinion."

MORNING BRIEFING: HERE'S A PERFECT FIX FOR GRATEFUL BASEBALL JUNKIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of those delighted to receive the 1989 edition of the Elias Baseball 
Analyst was Newsday's Marty Noble, who called it "the most fascinating baseball 
publication this side of Mickey Rivers' dictionary, Casey Stengel's thesaurus 
and the April issue of Penthouse." 
</P>
<P>
Among the gems Noble culled from the pages of the fifth edition: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Boston's Dwight Evans was two for two on Memorial Day, three for four on 
the Fourth of July and three for five on Labor Day. He hit a home run and drove 
in three runs in each game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In his eight seasons with the New York Yankees, Dave Winfield has driven in 
744 runs, the most in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Angels have the worst Friday-the-13th record in baseball, 7-17. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson was searching for the right mix, he 
used a major league high of 108 different starting lineups. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chicago White Sox third baseman Steve Lyons led the league in errors with 
29. Twenty of his first 24 appearances were as a defensive replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- San Diego's John Kruk has not been hit by a pitch in 1,320 major league 
plate appearances, the most among active players. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: Fifty-one years ago today, Temple defeated Colorado at Madison Square 
Garden, N.Y., 60-36, in the final of the first major postseason college 
basketball tournament. What was the tournament? 
</P>
<P>
Feelings of Bliss: New Mexico Coach Dave Bliss, who in the past has taken 
Southern Methodist University to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
tournament, will take his team to the National Invitation Tournament this year. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA snubbed New Mexico, despite the Lobos' 20-10 record. Bliss' reaction? 
"That's why I came here, so I could go to the NIT," he said. "I've been to the 
NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
Gone but not forgotten: New Dodger Eddie Murray doesn't have anything to say to 
Baltimore writers, but that hasn't kept them from continuing to take shots at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun about Murray, who will have his 
No. 33 retired by the Orioles: "If the Baltimore Orioles wanted to retire 
something of Eddie Murray's, they should have selected his pants. He didn't get 
them dirty." 
</P>
<P>
The risk-taker: Mike Schmidt was talking about the possibility of failure as he 
prepares for his 17th major league season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's human nature for the way fans perceive me that my career would be 
clouded by the final years," he said. "They'll look back and remember Willie 
Mays dying on the vine for the Mets. It took them 10 years to get over that and 
remember that he was one of the greatest players to ever play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not want people to look back on me and think I was dying on the vine 
for a last-place club. So, yes, I am taking a risk here." 
</P>
<P>
Knight errand: Even though his Indiana basketball team was beaten twice by 
Illinois, Coach Bob Knight is less than thrilled at having the Hoosiers not 
seeded No. 1 in the Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Big Ten champion doesn't get the first seed -- the best league in the 
country according to every power rating I've seen -- then why the hell play it? 
</P>
<P>
"What we ought to do is schedule 18 Hoosier Conference teams." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, no such conference exists. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The National Invitation Tournament. The NCAA Tournament didn't 
begin until the following year, 1939, when Oregon beat Ohio State at Evanston, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Said New York Ranger rookie Tony Granato after fans showered the ice 
with mugs following a loss on Gift Mug Night: "I'm just glad it wasn't Machete 
Night."

Maurice Douglass of the Chicago Bears testified that agent Lloyd Bloom had 
threatened to "have somebody break my legs" if Douglass stopped doing business 
with Bloom and Norby Walters without returning money and cars given him by the 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for Walters and Bloom argued that Douglass was "double-dealing" by 
signing with them and with another agent at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based agents are on trial in Chicago for fraud, racketeering and 
extortion, and are accused of offering college athletes thousands of dollars to 
become clients and threatening them with violence when they tried to back out 
of the deals. 
</P>
<P>
Walters and Bloom have pleaded not guilty, claiming they were cheated out of 
the commissions owed them when the athletes signed contracts with professional 
football teams.

A West German track and field coach, who according to West German news reports 
told sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko that his athletes were using drugs, 
denied he had ever discussed the topic with the Canadian athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Heinz-Jochen Spilker's name was mentioned by Issajenko during her 
testimony in Toronto before a government inquiry into drug use among athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Issajenko reportedly testified that Spilker had told her in 1984 that West 
German athletes were using testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
"This is nonsense," Spilker said. "I never discussed this with Angella. My 
conversations with Angella were limited to, 'How are you doing,' and 'Good luck 
in today's race.' "

THE NHL / TRACY DODDS; 
</P>
<P>
TIME FOR NEW KING FANS TO BRUSH UP ON THAT HOCKEY TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tracy Dodds 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hockey is catching on in Los Angeles. The Kings are packing the Forum almost 
every night, adding thousands of new fans to the old hard-core followers. 
</P>
<P>
And we Americans think we're learning the game because we know the difference 
between a red line and a blue line, a forecheck and a backcheck, a high stick 
and a high five. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
With playoffs just around the corner, there's more to learn so that we don't 
sound like a bunch of cementheads. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, that was a slip. Cementhead doesn't necessarily mean stupid or 
uninformed. In hockey circles, a cementhead is a player whose specific role is 
to be an enforcer, to fight. If he scores goals, fine. But that's not his job. 
If his I.Q. is in the genius range, that's fine, too. But he's still a 
cementhead. 
</P>
<P>
And when cementheads drop their gloves (which means take off those big, bulky 
cushions they wear on their hands, so that they can really punch) and tie up 
their opponents' arms by pulling their sweaters (jerseys that are not knitted 
of wool) halfway off, and smash faces and bloody the ice -- that's not brutal. 
Not in hockey terms. Not if it's an even-up spilling of blood. 
</P>
<P>
Brutal refers, loosely, to a mismatch. When a team loses, 11-3, that's brutal. 
When a goalie gives up goals on the first three shots he faces, that's brutal. 
A long trip can be brutal, too. But they never call a brawl brutal, no matter 
what the degree of brutality. 
</P>
<P>
No, a game filled with hard-checking and elbowing and defensive bumping and 
lots of little scraps would not be called brutal, it would be called chippy. 
Now, chippy may sound like a yuppie nickname or some happy derivative of 
chipper but it's not a friendly term in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
And only in hockey is the word turtle used as a verb, as in, "What could I do? 
The guy turtled on me." That means that he dropped to the ice, cowering in a 
defensive crouch and used those big old gloves to cover his head. 
</P>
<P>
In a column in the Hockey News, in which he shared some helpful hints for 
Americans "in the spirit of free trade," comic actor Bob McKenzie assumes that 
Americans know the basic hockey terms, like cementhead and five-hole. 
</P>
<P>
(Don't tell him if you don't know that the five-hole is the space between the 
goalie's legs.) 
</P>
<P>
For example, he explains that what the Zamboni does to ice between periods is 
flood the ice. Not scrape ice. Not make ice. And a person who plays the right 
wing position is a right winger, not a right wing. And there is no such thing 
as a hockey locker room. It's the dressing room. Or the room. And to play 
junior hockey is to play junior not juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in Canada there is a place called Medicine Hat that is always 
referred to as the Hat. But if you ask a guy if he played juniors in the Hat, 
you've blown it. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of subtleties that give us away, that make those who speak 
hockey in the native language grimace. The way we'd feel if somebody called Joe 
Montana a quarterbacker. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in the language of hockey, Edmonton Oilers goalie Grant Fuhr was 
actually complimenting teammate Esa Tikkanen when he called him "a royal pain 
in the . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen has perfected the art of shadowing and generally harassing players 
such as Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. As if the constant physical 
interference weren't enough, he talks nonstop. Tikkanen calls it yapping. 
</P>
<P>
The Edmonton Journal collected these opinions on Tikkanen's style: 
</P>
<P>
Dave Ellett of Winnipeg: "He gets under your skin. He's there to cause 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Burns of Montreal: "I don't know if despise is a strong enough word." 
</P>
<P>
Craig MacTavish of Edmonton: "He's the best defensive forward in the game. 
There's not a better checker in the NHL and he's got all kinds of offensive 
tools." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Coffey of Pittsburgh, a former teammate: "He's got a lot of talent, and 
not a whole lot of fear." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky of the Kings, another former teammate: "I just felt like telling him to 
shut up. I said, 'Tikk, I never understood you when I was playing with you, and 
I don't understand you now." 
</P>
<P>
Jari Kurri of the Oilers: "He's settled down. He's still a crazy Finn, but he's 
learned a lot. . . . He's learned to play his own game now. Not sit in the 
penalty box." 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen: "You need everyone good to win the Stanley Cup. Team needs a fighter. 
Somebody checker. Somebody scoring. Grant Fuhr. Somebody yapping." 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Gazette polled 21 Canadiens, asking who they would rather have on 
their team right now, Gretzky or Lemieux. Twelve picked Gretzky, six picked 
Lemieux, two couldn't decide and one chose neither. 
</P>
<P>
Canadien Ryan Walter added: "The Gretzky-Lemieux business is a fun thing. It 
beats debating Wade Boggs and Steve Garvey." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach Glen Sather has never been shy about giving honest opinions on 
Gretzky, even when his comments weren't too flattering and even when the Great 
One was an Oiler. 
</P>
<P>
Sather said last week: "Over the years, (Gretzky) has developed an aura, a 
mystique. Much of it is crap, but his teammates believe he can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, that's what a mystique is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
While Canada is exporting its hockey players to the U.S., the U.S. is stocking 
Europe's teams. According to the Amateur Hockey Assn. of the United States, 
there are 107 U.S.-born players on professional hockey teams in 12 European 
countries. That's more than on NHL teams. . . . Just before New York Islander 
Bryan Trottier played his club-record 1,061st game, one more than Denis Potvin, 
General Manager Bill Torrey was saying, "I don't think he's finished as a 
hockey player. You're dead wrong if you think that." Trottier, 32, scored the 
game-winning goal Monday night in a 5-3 victory at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Capitals had to cancel practice last Saturday when an employee 
of the Capital Centre found road flares in a box labeled "explosives" and 
thought they were dynamite. Fire officials evacuated the building. . . . 
Several teams, including the Kings, have had charter flights canceled because 
they were using Air Ontario. An Air Ontario jet crashed last Friday near 
Dryden, Canada, killing 24. There was little grumbling when the Kings were told 
they'd be busing between Montreal and Quebec.

Ken Atkinson scored a career-high 24 points, getting 18 from three-point range, 
and Richmond's basketball team gunned down Temple, 70-56, in a first-round game 
of the National Invitation Tournament at Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, who made six of nine three-point shots, scored seven points as the 
Spiders (21-9) closed the first half with a 14-7 run to take a 35-25 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Temple (18-12) fell behind, 44-27, early in the second half but scored 11 
straight points to get back into the game momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
Then Atkinson sank two three-pointers as Richmond moved to a 52-38 lead, and 
Temple didn't threaten again. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Macon scored 13 points for Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 81, Akron 70 -- Perry Carter scored 19 points, and Jamaal Brown 
added 18 points as the Buckeyes ended an eight-game losing streak by beating 
the Zips at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory for Ohio State (18-14), runner-up to Connecticut in 
the NIT last season, since All-American guard Jay Burson went out for the 
season with a broken bone in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Akron (21-8) had a 34-33 halftime lead, but the Buckeyes took charge with a 
19-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin 63, New Orleans 61 -- Trent Jackson scored 22 points, including two 
free throws with 21 seconds left, and the Badgers held off the Privateers at 
Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Bennett hit a three-pointer for New Orleans (18-11) with 13 seconds 
left, but Wisconsin (19-11), making its first postseason appearance in 42 
years, ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Harris scored 27 points for the Privateers. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's 70, Mississippi 67 -- Robert Werdann made two free throws with 14 
seconds remaining, and the Redmen rallied to beat the Rebels in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Williams had 17 of his 25 points in the second half as the Redmen -- 
making a 25th straight postseason appearance, longest streak in the nation -- 
rallied after Ole Miss (15-15) built a 49-38 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Malik Sealy added 19 points for St. John's (16-13). 
</P>
<P>
In other opening-round games Wednesday night, defending NIT champion 
Connecticut beat North Carolina Charlotte, 67-62; Penn State downed Murray 
State, 89-73; St. Louis trounced Southern Illinois, 87-54, and Villanova routed 
St. Peter's, 76-56.

determine which plays better, a happy team or an angry one. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said: "We are excited that our basketball season 
has been extended (by) at least one more game. 
</P>
<P>
"The prestige that our program has developed and our tough schedule were 
probably big factors in helping us earn a spot in this year's NIT. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be a banner year for the (West Coast Athletic Conference), 
with Loyola Marymount and St. Mary's going to the NCAAs and (Pepperdine) and 
Santa Clara returning to the NIT." 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine (19-12) finished the regular season in a second-place tie in the 
WCAC with Loyola. The Lions earned an automatic bid to the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. tournament by defeating Santa Clara in the tournament final. St. 
Mary's, the regular-season conference champion, received an NCAA at-large bid. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies (21-10) lost to Nevada Las Vegas last Saturday in the final of the 
Big West Conference tournament, 68-62. But New Mexico State Coach Neil McCarthy 
believes that his team should be in the NCAA tournament with the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"We finished second in our conference, second in our conference tournament," 
McCarthy said. "We were overachievers all year. We won 12 of our final 16 
games, and two of those (games) were very respectable losses to UNLV. I feel 
disappointed that we didn't get in." 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies lost conference games to the Rebels this season, 75-73, at home, 
and, 79-58, at Las Vegas. In December, UNLV routed Pepperdine, at Las Vegas, 
88-56. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Roberson, a 6-foot 8-inch forward, leads the Aggies with averages of 
14.3 points and 7.3 rebounds a game. Pepperdine is led by All-WCAC forwards Tom 
Lewis, who is averaging 16.4 points and 5.3 rebounds, and Dexter Howard at 16.3 
points and 7 rebounds.

DODGER NOTEBOOK;

<P>
BROTHER, THIS KID LOOKS LIKE A BATTING CHAMPION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Gwynn longs for the day when people stop referring to him as Tony Gwynn's 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
Chris is having a tough enough time trying to edge into the Dodgers' crowded 
outfield this spring without being constantly compared to the three-time 
National League batting champion in his family. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chris Gwynn is the same type of hitter as Tony -- he drills line 
drives -- he hasn't come close to the numbers posted by his older brother with 
the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the .299 batting average Chris Gwynn compiled at triple-A Albuquerque 
last year wasn't all that bad. It only looked that way when matched against 
Tony's six consecutive .300-plus seasons and career .331 average in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
So what if Chris Gwynn isn't a second Tony Gwynn? The Dodgers are high enough 
on him to consider him a candidate for their 24-man roster, and for the 
defending World Series champions, that's a major compliment. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Dodgers' No. 45 could just as well have been the Padres' No. 19 in 
disguise when he started in left field against the Minnesota Twins Wednesday. 
He looked like a carbon copy of brother Tony as he lined a double down each 
foul line in his first two times at bat. His two-for-three day in the Dodgers' 
5-4 victory raised his exhibition average to .450 -- nine for 20. 
</P>
<P>
"We're both contact hitters," Chris said. "We're both left-handed, so I guess I 
picked up my stroke from watching him when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
At 24 -- Tony is 28 -- Chris is still young enough that a return ticket to 
Albuquerque wouldn't put a serious crimp in his career. He already has put in 
two seasons there, however, so he sees nothing to be gained from a third. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, it was good for me to go back," Chris said. "We were loaded with 
outfielders, and I knew I'd be better off playing every day. Now I just want to 
be here, even if it means pinch-hitting and backup duty." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn noted that Mike Devereaux, a fellow rookie outfielder up from 
Albuquerque, got a big break when the Dodgers traded him to the Baltimore 
Orioles last Saturday for pitcher Mike Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he wishes he had gone in Devereaux's place, Gwynn said, "If that's 
what it takes for me to play, yes. Actually, the trade was a great break for 
all of us -- Mike, me and Jose Gonzalez (still another outfield hopeful from 
Albuquerque). 
</P>
<P>
"Last spring, we had so many outfielders here that you might get two hits and 
somebody else might get three. Now it's down to Jose and me, and my goal is to 
be consistent. I want to open someone's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
When Gwynn said the outfield competition boiled down to him and Gonzalez, he 
didn't mean that one of them was sure to make the team. Unless Franklin Stubbs 
is traded, which could happen, there may not be an opening. 
</P>
<P>
Barring a deal, Mike Davis and Stubbs will be the primary outfield spares 
behind Kirk Gibson, John Shelby and Mike Marshall. Stubbs also figures to 
understudy Eddie Murray at first base. Whether that leaves a spot for a sixth 
outfielder depends on how Manager Tom Lasorda arranges the roster. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan, nominally an infielder, is getting a tryout in the outfield. If 
he and utility infielders Dave Anderson and Mike Sharperson all stay, and 
Stubbs isn't traded, both Gwynn and Gonzalez will be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want a left-handed contact hitter off the bench, I could be their 
man," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
A remark made by Manager Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds last season is still 
a source of enjoyment for Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda. Before Wednesday's 
exhibition against the Minnesota Twins, Lasorda said, "Last year, Pete Rose 
became one of the greatest prophets of all time. They beat us, 18-2, in 
Cincinnati one night, and the next day he said, 'The Dodgers? I'm not worried 
about the Dodgers. I'm worried about the (San Francisco) Giants and Houston.' 
The next time in, we were 8 1/2 games in front." 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Alfredo Griffin has been so hot that when he went two for four 
Wednesday, he dropped four points to .541. . . . Third baseman Jeff Hamilton, 
who has been out a week with a bruised left thigh, is almost ready to return to 
the lineup. . . . Mike Morgan, the newest Dodger, will continue his bid for the 
fifth starting spot in a stint scheduled for three innings against the Montreal 
Expos at Vero Beach today.

PLANNING YOUR PET'S VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning for summer vacation? Don't forget Fifi or Fidette or Max. It's not too 
early to check out kennels, catteries or dog and cat hotels your pet can stay 
in while you're away. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California has a vast choice of facilities offering everything from 
basic no-frills board and care to amenities such as windowed condominiums for 
cats or $55-a-day doggie suites with color television sets. (Maybe your dog 
likes to watch TV but remember -- he is colorblind.) 
</P>
<P>
Animal kennels and boarding facilities are regulated and inspected by county 
and/or city officials. Some are run privately by non-veterinarians. Others are 
run by vets who set up separate boarding facilities near their clinics. Some 
vets will board your pet at their animal hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The newest Los Angeles facility, Pet Resort in Sepulveda, opened in October. 
Run by the Adler Veterinary Group, it boards dogs, cats, birds and reptiles. It 
has a swimming pool for dogs and a Jacuzzi for arthritic canines. For felines, 
it offers condos with brass beds. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you're not seeking that level of luxury for your pet, experts and 
veterinarians say you should follow rule No. 1 in choosing a facility: Inspect 
it. And if you like it, book it as soon as you can, especially for holiday 
weekends or peak summer vacation periods. 
</P>
<P>
A trusted relative or friend who likes a particular kennel can offer help in 
finding that perfect boarding facility, says Dr. A. E. Cady, a Covina 
veterinarian and president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to have a personal recommendation from a friend who has boarded 
a dog or cat there and had a lack of health problems after boarding," Cady 
says. "But you still want to make sure the kennel has a good sanitation record 
and requires preventive inoculations before you board there. The better kennels 
and boarding facilities also have requirements that the animal cannot be 
admitted with fleas." 
</P>
<P>
Many facilities will not board a pet without written proof or a vet's call 
assuring that an animal has had its shots. This may seem inconvenient, but it 
is a protection for your pet's health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site Visits a Must 
</P>
<P>
Beware of kennels or catteries that won't let you inspect the runs or rooms. 
Some operators don't like to let potential clients in these areas because they 
can create a disturbance or carry germs. Still, at least try to see the 
critical areas through a viewing window. 
</P>
<P>
"Check to make sure the place is clean, and go back and look at the kennels," 
advised Kim Campbell Thornton, editor of Dog Fancy magazine in Irvine. "If they 
won't let you or don't have a window you can look through, I would not advise 
you to leave your animal there. I wouldn't leave mine." 
</P>
<P>
Before boarding a pet, ask also how much contact it will have with people. 
After all, you don't want to leave your four-footed friend, accustomed to lots 
of attention at home, languishing in a cage. "Pet-to-people contact is very 
important," said Dr. Leslie Malo, a Garden Grove vet who opened Animal Inns of 
America in October, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to exercise, animal experts queried say it's best for dogs to 
have outside runs; cats don't need runs because they exercise isometrically -- 
stretching, not running. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ted Adler, who built the Pet Resort, has grassy runs outdoors where dogs 
can exercise, though he also thinks it's healthy for them to swim: "Swimming is 
worth a least five to seven times more than playing and running. Ten minutes of 
exercise in the pool . . . is like a dog running in the park for 40 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Be wary if a manager says a facility boards in cages but doesn't have runs, 
Thornton says. Dog owners, she says, should "ask how the animals are exercised 
and what the sizes of the cages are, and what kind of food they feed. Some dogs 
don't do well on strange food -- they get upset stomachs." 
</P>
<P>
It's also worth checking to see if the facility has trained personnel and 
offers 24-hour vet availability; that it has good ventilation and maintains 
normal temperatures in its building; that its cages and sleeping accommodations 
are comfortable for animals; whether it offers grooming services; that its food 
and water is served in a sanitary manner; and that it is secure, having, for 
example, smoke alarms and a fire emergency plan. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of boarding facilities in Los Angeles and Orange counties shows that 
many will feed pets their regular food if provided it. Some charge extra, 
though, for special feedings. 
</P>
<P>
When inquiring about the per day price, be sure to check about those extra 
services, which can add up. The daily cat rate, for instance, might be $6 or 
$7. But add in special food, daily snacks and a brushing and the daily rate 
could escalate to $11 or $12. Many facilities charge an added fee for 
medicating an animal, though some won't even take pets needing such care. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to let kennel personnel know if your animal has odd habits (if, for 
example, it barks or meows a lot) or if it has special breed traits that might 
affect it in case of illness (greyhounds, for example, require less anesthetic 
than most breeds, says greyhound owner Thornton.) 
</P>
<P>
Though rates vary, they usually are higher in large cities, says James Krack, 
executive director of the American Boarding Kennels Assn., a Colorado Springs, 
Colo.-based trade group. Boarding rates for dogs vary according to an animal's 
size and weight. In Los Angeles and Orange counties, basic fees range roughly 
from $6 to $10 a day for a small dog; $10 to $16.50 for a large dog. 
</P>
<P>
"The upscale kennels that provide those extra services . . . are offering two 
things -- providing care for the animals and peace of mind for the owners," 
Krack says. "But people should evaluate the kennel on basics -- security, 
safety, supervision and sanitation. They should insist on the basics and then 
go on to some extras." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Door-to-Door Service 
</P>
<P>
Some facilities will pick up and deliver pets; others will arrange for it. "We 
can have any pet picked up or delivered," Adler said. "But I like the owners to 
bring them in themselves. It's far better for the animals. It's less stress. 
And we want to try to reduce stress." 
</P>
<P>
To further minimize wear and tear on pets, Krack recommends that owners not 
board them when they're just puppies or kittens. But don't wait until animals 
are too old to introduce them to boarding, with which they also should 
experience occasionally just to keep comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
He says owners can create problems, especially "if your dog sees you packing 
your suitcases or crying at the kennel. And don't let the kids hug him and cry. 
Animals pick up on that and get very stressed." 
</P>
<P>
Once a pet returns, he recommends that owners not overfeed or overwater them. 
With dogs, especially, it is advisable to wait four hours or so before feeding; 
they can get ice cubes instead of a lot of water.

THE WILL TO DIE; 
</P>
<P>
SUICIDE IS A TRAGIC SECRET FOR THE ELDERLY, ESPECIALLY FOR MEN AND EVEN MORE SO 
IN CALIFORNIA

<P>
Nobody really knows why Daniel Rosenthal gave up on life. 
</P>
<P>
True, he was 88 years old, but he still taught a college course, seemed to be 
in good health and had an uncommon zest for living. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke eight languages and had written books in many of them. After retiring 
in 1967 after 21 years at the UCLA School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 
he continued to visit his professor emeritus office in Boelter Hall, and was 
there on March 6, three days before his death. 
</P>
<P>
On Mondays for the last dozen years, the snowy-haired professor conducted 
courses for about 30 older people under the auspices of Santa Monica College's 
Emeritus College program. His most recent course: "The Aspects of Aging." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Active Life 
</P>
<P>
A widower, he maintained an active life, speaking regularly with his daughter, 
taking long walks, going out for dinner with friends. 
</P>
<P>
Yet last Thursday, just before the sun rose on a springlike morning, Daniel 
Rosenthal, a diminutive man with a towering intellect, went to the balcony of 
his 12th-story apartment in West Los Angeles, took off his slippers, climbed a 
patio chair and plunged over the railing to his death. 
</P>
<P>
He left a brief note to his daughter on the kitchen table. "Dearest," it read 
in part, ". . . can no longer bear the idea of becoming a useless vegetable. 
(signed) Daniel." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal's case is tragically typical. The suicide rates among older males are 
strikingly high, increasing steadily after age 65. Nationally, there are 35.5 
reported suicides for every 100,000 males from 65 to 74 years old, according to 
the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate soars to 54.8 from ages 75 
to 84, and to 61.6 for those 85 and older. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the rates are higher still. According to the California 
Department of Health Services, the rate of suicide per 100,000 males ages 85 
and older is 105.5. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that suicide among the elderly, especially males, takes 
place much more than statistics show. One major reason is that, because death 
among the old is an expected happening, often it isn't recorded as anything 
other than a natural occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
"Although there is little clear evidence, we feel that the suicide rate among 
the elderly may be hidden to a great extent," said Dr. Dan Blazer, professor of 
psychiatry at Duke University and a nationally recognized authority on suicide 
in later life. "Older persons, for instance, can take their own lives in such 
little-detectable ways as neglecting to take essential medicine." 
</P>
<P>
When a younger person dies unexpectedly, there is more likelihood of an autopsy 
and investigation, Blazer said. "When a senior dies, it may have actually been 
a suicide, but authorities often will write it off as a heart attack or simply 
death from old age." 
</P>
<P>
An article in Newslink, the publication of the Denver-based American Assn. of 
Suicidology, noted that "the tremendous focus on the young (and suicides) has 
led us to largely ignore an even higher risk group. Suicide among the elderly 
has been neglected despite the increasing numbers and proportions of the old in 
our population." 
</P>
<P>
The high rate of suicide among older males, Blazer said, tends to drive up the 
statistics for the elderly as a whole. In all age groups, in fact, far fewer 
women take their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Experts say women cope better with the onset of old age and, if 
necessary, with having to be by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Older males seem to have more difficulty in coping with living alone," Blazer 
explained. "They may have difficulty in caring for themselves, and probably 
don't recognize health problems as well as females. They don't go to doctors as 
often as women." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, "men tend to have fewer affiliative relationships, fewer 
friends. Women, if they are feeling depressed, often have human resources at 
their command." 
</P>
<P>
Blazer mentioned another aspect, what he called the cohort effect. "In separate 
years, people who are, say, age 65, may have different suicide rates. This is 
because of generational differences. They may have, because of when they were 
born, gone through entirely distinct life experiences." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking had been Daniel Rosenthal's life. Born in Poland, he earned a 
doctorate in engineering from the Free University of Brussels, and taught there 
before fleeing with his wife, Anna, only days before the Nazis arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The couple spent time in France, Morocco and Portugal, and finally settled in 
the United States. Rosenthal taught four years at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology before joining UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Rosenthal's wife died after a lingering illness, apparently 
Alzheimer's disease. Friends theorized that perhaps he grew afraid of becoming 
a vegetable, a burden on others. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, he commented to a visitor: "As I grew older, I never gave much 
thought to how much longer I would last. But of one thing I was certain: If I 
allowed my brain to become fallow, I would become a vegetable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Above-Average Intelligence 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the last few years, if anyone doubted that Rosenthal still had 
above-average mental faculties, that person would only have had to listen to 
his classroom handling of topics such as "Computer: Friend or Foe," or "The 
East and West in Science." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the course papers the professor handed out (he had taught himself to 
use a word processor), complete with footnotes, would have done a Ph.D. thesis 
proud, such as his tracing of how mankind throughout history has dealt with the 
relationship between mind and body. 
</P>
<P>
At one time his course was titled: "Your Brain: Use It or Lose It." 
</P>
<P>
"You live as long as you learn!" he once emphasized to a visitor in his 
Chaucer-and-Dante-lined apartment. 
</P>
<P>
But if Rosenthal felt he was losing ground mentally or physically, he didn't 
let on. In the week before his death, except for a touch of the flu, he seemed 
to be fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Daniel called me a few days before the Monday class and asked me to lead it," 
said one of his students, 75-year-old Harry Block. "He said he had the flu." 
</P>
<P>
George Sines, a UCLA professor of engineering and a colleague of Rosenthal's 
for 42 years, said his wife talked with the octogenarian several days later. 
"Although Daniel was slightly in doubt as to whether he would be able to make 
it," Sines said, "he agreed to go out with my wife and I on Saturday night for 
dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Dale, Rosenthal's adopted daughter, said she checked up on him by phone 
twice last Wednesday, the day before his death. "I would have gone over," the 
daughter recalled, "but I also had the flu, and I didn't want his to get worse. 
He said nothing unusual." 
</P>
<P>
An elderly neighbor in the apartment complex said he was taking a stroll on the 
grounds about 4 p.m. Wednesday and saw his friend Rosenthal out for a walk. "I 
talked with him a few hours later on the phone and invited him over for dinner 
Thursday night," said the neighbor, who also lives alone. "He said he would 
call me in the morning and let me know for sure. He said nothing out of the 
ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, few elderly suicide victims of either sex seek help before deciding 
on the most drastic of steps. "Only about 5% of the approximately 1,200 calls 
we get monthly are from people 65 or older," said Norman L. Farberow, 
co-founder of the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The older don't reach out as much as we would like them to," Farberow said. 
"They relate more to somebody reaching out to them than vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
The end-it-all danger among the elderly is greater in an urban environment such 
as Los Angeles, Farberow said. "In a rural or small-town setting, they would 
probably have more contacts with neighbors, friends and relatives. Here they 
may feel more isolated. Sometimes nobody perhaps even knows if they are sick, 
except when they don't show up to pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
Farberow remembered one case of an older woman whose son had moved out of Los 
Angeles for business reasons, leaving her alone. "She became depressed, and was 
considering suicide. She had a feeling of aloneness and of abandonment." 
</P>
<P>
The Samaritans, a Boston-based suicide prevention group, has said that whereas 
some think the main cause of life-taking among the elderly is terminal illness, 
more likely the reason is recognized and untreated depression. 
</P>
<P>
And when oldsters make the grim decision, more often than not they mean it. 
</P>
<P>
"With the young, a suicide attempt often can be a cry for help," said Blazer, 
of Duke University. "Younger people attempt it more. I listen to all such talk 
thoroughly, but when it is made by an older person I listen especially 
thoroughly and I take the matter very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"Older people tend not to complain that they intend suicide. A survey we 
conducted found that twice as many people ages 35 to 60 said they had thought 
about suicide as had people over 60. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that for many of the elderly, suicide is a relatively impulsive act -- 
they are feeling terrible and want to escape those feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Is economic pressure, such as the high cost of living in cities such as Los 
Angeles, a factor in these tragedies among the old? "It could be," Blazer said, 
"but no one really knows. Studies have shown that black females have the lowest 
suicide risk, and the cost of living obviously affects them considerably." 
</P>
<P>
What about geographical areas? Perhaps significantly, the suicide rate is 
highest in those regions (largely Sun Belt) that attract the greatest number of 
retired persons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suicide Prevention 
</P>
<P>
Can anything be done to help to prevent suicides among the elderly, wherever 
they may live? Dr. Edwin S. Shneidman, professor of thanatology (the study of 
death and dying) at UCLA, said: "Probably the best thing is to understand the 
psychological needs of the elderly relating to loss and decrement. 
</P>
<P>
"Be kind to and empathize with the elderly in your family. You will be there 
too one day -- if you are lucky. If you address the psychological needs of the 
old, they are unlikely to commit suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Farberow suggested being aware of the old-timers in one's neighborhood, 
especially those who have lost spouses and friends, and who may be feeling the 
effects of being alone. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, it all may be in vain. With all too many of the elderly, 
there comes a time when the fatigue, the illness, the loneliness, the 
dependency, the loss of physical and mental abilities, the depression or the 
loss of a sense of meaningful existence, becomes overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Cousins said: "Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss 
is what dies inside us while we live." 
</P>
<P>
In the week since Daniel Rosenthal's death, the dominant question among those 
who knew him is, "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Coroner's autopsy found no evidence that Rosenthal 
suffered from any serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter said he gave no indication of being despondent. 
</P>
<P>
His grandson, George Dale, reflected that "to me it is shocking and sad, but it 
is something that is very much in line with his character." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson at Santa Monica College observed of the popular educator: "He 
was in control of his life, right to the end." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Block, who led the Emeritus College class on March 6 at the request of 
the professor, theorized: 
</P>
<P>
"All that some of us can figure out is that perhaps he felt he was slipping, 
and he didn't want to retrogress. He was aware of what he was capable of, and 
he didn't want to lose it. A man that proud of his intellect -- maybe he saw 
signs he might be a victim of Alzheimer's, and that would have been such an 
indignity to him."

ART-MINDED CROWD FETES LAUNCH OF NEW MAGAZINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Robert Crothers said, this was the last audience he had to convince about 
the importance of contemporary art in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But the art-minded crowd listened patiently anyway as Crothers, publisher of 
the new Artcoast magazine, gave his pitch about L. A. as the new center for 
modern art at a party to kick off the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Main Attraction 
</P>
<P>
The setting was the R. M. Schindler house on North Kings Road in West 
Hollywood. The rarely seen house, surrounded by high hedges, was a key draw for 
the guests who attended the cocktail reception Monday night. Museum curators, 
artists, gallery owners, art scholars and art appreciators wandered through the 
house, which is owned by Friends of the Schindler House, admiring its 
minimalist architectural design and warming themselves by the pressed sawdust 
logs in the fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Guests strolled out on the lawn for drinks and Chinese hors d'oeuvres, part of 
the Pacific Rim theme of the evening. The magazine, after all, is subtitled 
"Contemporary Art East and West," and uses Los Angeles as a focal point for 
exploring "visual culture," according to the premiere issue. 
</P>
<P>
Darkness made perusing the magazine next to impossible, but guests did their 
best anyway to leaf through the heavy volume, which makes its debut this month 
at a hefty $6. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought about having the reception in a restaurant," Crothers said, "but I 
think people appreciate the fact that we did something different." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Guest List 
</P>
<P>
Among the appreciative were artist David Hockney (with his two dachshunds in 
tow); magazine editor Kay Larson; Schindler house curator Robert Sweeney; 
producers Ray Stark and Douglas Cramer; Museum of Contemporary Art curator Mary 
Jane Jacobs; Stephanie Baron and Maurice Tuchman, curators at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art; gallery owner Margo Levin; MOCA board member Fred 
Nicholas and wife Joan; Henry Hopkins, director of the Frederick R. Weisman Art 
Foundation; Al Nodal, city cultural affairs department general manager, and 
artists John Baldessari and Don Bachardy, who talked about his upcoming book of 
portraits of writer Christopher Isherwood. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bachardy of the portraits, done in the last six months of Isherwood's 
life: "It was the most extraordinary experience of my life -- so far."

CHAMPIONS CUP AT INDIAN WELLS;

FIRST, AGASSI DEFEATS VAN RENSBURG, THEN HE TAKES ON CRITICS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Agassi brought his racket (whatever kind it really is) and came out 
swinging. This was in the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
Not long before, on Stadium Court, Agassi defeated Christo van Rensburg, 2-6, 
6-1, 6-2, in the second round of the Newsweek Champions Cup Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Then he really loosened up. In a matter of minutes, he dusted off John McEnroe, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who has been skewered like shish kebab by reporters in recent months, 
said a few words in his defense. Actually, he said a lot of words on a lot of 
topics, except for one curious omission: his racket. 
</P>
<P>
The one he played with sure looked like a Prince racket, which wouldn't make 
much difference except that Agassi recently signed a five-year, $6-million 
contract to play with a racket made by the Belgium manufacturer Donnay. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shelton, Agassi's agent, insisted that the racket was a "prototype Donnay 
racket." 
</P>
<P>
However, van Rensburg, who observed the racket from fairly close range, said he 
saw what brand it was. 
</P>
<P>
"A Prince," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The chair umpire, Dana Loconto of Alabama, was asked what kind of racket it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"A Prince," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What a life Agassi is living. To hear some say, it's king, prince or clown. 
Another day, another controversy. If it isn't about his racket, it's about his 
image. If it isn't about his image, it's about McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
And what about McEnroe? Well, McEnroe has been critical of Agassi in the press. 
Someone has told Agassi about it. 
</P>
<P>
This could mean that it's going to be a wonderful Davis Cup match against 
France, April 7-9 in San Diego, if America's top two singles players stand back 
to back, walk 10 paces, turn and fire rackets (whatever brand they chose) at 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be fair for me to accuse John McEnroe of something 
without hearing it from him in person," Agassi said. "He used to be 18 once. 
It's his insecure way of handling it in criticizing me, to be honest." 
</P>
<P>
Then Agassi said they're both professionals, they're both entitled to their 
opinions and nothing's going to get in the way of their mission in the Davis 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
But . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You don't find too many people in this business who want to tell you things to 
your face," Agassi said. "I don't see why he doesn't come up to me. Instead, he 
comes in here (to interview rooms). His mouth goes a mile a minute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing because if there's one person in the world you can find a 
lot of negative things about, it's John. Whenever someone has asked me about 
him, I don't say anything unless it's positive." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he may soon start saying things that aren't so positive about 
McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
Standing together at the back of the interview tent were Agassi's first and 
last line of defense. From left to right, they were Shelton, brother Phil 
Agassi and Coach Nick Bollettieri. 
</P>
<P>
They wore solemn faces all the while Andre met the press. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ever tried to do was do good things for tennis," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
While his critics gather at the net, Agassi said he really doesn't intend to 
make any changes in the way he does business. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty insecure, a pretty shallow person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reformed brat Jimmy Connors, 36, is twice Agassi's age. Connors made short work 
(58 minutes) of 24-year-old Jimmy Arias, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Connors was asked if he took any particular delight in beating younger players. 
</P>
<P>
"Who do I play that's older?" he said. "Who do I play that's my age?" 
</P>
<P>
Last week at Scottsdale, Connors lost to Johan Kriek, 30, in the first round, 
although Connors said he played reasonably well in a three-set defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Connors underwent surgery to remove bone spurs and bone chips from his left 
foot last November and said he has fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
The problem now, Connors said, is to get into enough matches so that he can 
improve his game to the level it was last year. And this year, like every one 
since Connors turned pro 17 years ago, there are plenty of good, young players 
around to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I play, to see if my game holds up with the new, strong youth," 
Connors said. "It's still what I do. It's war out there and that's the way I'm 
going to treat it." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Racket Story II: Yannick Noah gave his racket to 13-year-old Daniel 
Gebremeskal, a ballboy, after a 6-1, 6-2, victory over Javier Sanchez. During 
the match, Noah had hit the teen-ager in the groin with a ball. Noah said he is 
putting off knee surgery because it would keep him off the Grand Prix circuit 
for six months. "My knee is fine if I take about 60 aspirins an hour," Noah 
said. . . . Miloslav Mecir, the seventh-seeded player, dropped the first set to 
Mark Woodforde before winning, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. Mecir will play Pete Sampras 
next. Sampras defeated Anders Jarryd, 7-5, 6-2.

2 RETARDED CLIENTS LIVING IN CARE HOME ONCE CLOSED BY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A community care home for the mentally retarded in South-Central Los Angeles -- 
closed by state officials two years ago because of alleged failure to provide 
proper care to clients -- has been illegally operating for months with the 
knowledge of state licensing officials and private social workers for the 
developmentally disabled, state officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
One of two retarded residents now living in the Lois L. Jones Family Home on 
West 63rd Street gave birth there to a child who drowned in a toilet before the 
facility was closed. The woman -- who records indicate has the mental capacity 
of a 10-year-old child -- now has a 9-month-old baby living with her in the 
facility. State Department of Social Service licensing officials consider that 
situation potentially dangerous for the residents and infant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clients Removed 
</P>
<P>
About half a dozen clients were removed from the home in the spring of 1987 
after years of substandard care, state licensing officials said. Inspectors 
maintained that the memory of Lois L. Jones, operator of the home, had become 
so impaired that she could not give proper care to the clients. Officials also 
charged that Jones' son, who has a record of committing violent crimes, was 
living in the home and posed a potential threat to residents. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic and tragic allegation made by state inspectors was that on 
Jan. 23, 1986, a client -- call her Jane for reasons of confidentiality -- gave 
birth to an 8-pound baby boy in a bathroom of the home; the child drowned in 
the toilet and was put outside in the trash. Jones apparently was in another 
room of the house when the baby was born and later told police that she was not 
even aware that the client was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Baby Born 
</P>
<P>
When the home was closed more than a year later, Jane and another client -- 
call her Mary -- were placed in the Salubrium Living Center, a large rundown 
home for the retarded and mentally ill in a tough neighborhood on West 
Washington Boulevard. In May, Jane gave birth to another baby at that facility. 
Jane, 35, and Mary, 41, then moved back into the Jones Family Home along with 
the baby, against the advice of their social workers. 
</P>
<P>
The South Central Los Angeles Regional Center -- a private, nonprofit agency 
responsible for providing state-funded services to the developmentally disabled 
-- has been aware for nine months that its clients, Jane and Mary, had moved 
back into the Jones Family Home. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at the center say that the adult women do not have legal 
guardians and therefore have the right to refuse social workers' advice and may 
live wherever they choose, regardless of how vulnerable they may be to 
exploitation. Officials of the regional center also say that they were under no 
obligation to report to state licensing inspectors that the clients had moved 
into the unlicensed home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Need to Inform' 
</P>
<P>
"There would be no need to inform them because we don't have a relationship 
with the facility (Jones Family Home)," said Dexter A. Henderson, director of 
the regional center. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security disability checks are used to pay the nearly $500 per month 
each woman is charged to live in the Jones home. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state Department of Social Services, the agency responsible 
for licensing most homes for the retarded, say that the women may indeed have 
the right to live wherever they choose, but Lois Jones does not have the right 
to provide them with what the state defines as "care and supervision" without a 
license. They also say that regional center social workers should have informed 
licensing officials when the clients moved back into the facility in May. 
</P>
<P>
But state licensing officials in Los Angeles -- after learning in September 
that the home was again in operation -- did not take action for months, despite 
concern for the safety of Jane's baby as well as that of the women residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid of child endangerment," acknowledged Leo Riske, licensing program 
supervisor in the Los Angeles office of the state Department of Social 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Notified 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 9 -- three months after learning that the women and baby were in the 
home -- state licensing officials notified the Los Angeles County Department of 
Children's Services that they were concerned over the welfare of the infant. 
Children's services officials refused to divulge details of any investigation 
into the case, citing privacy regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Blyth, Los Angeles district manager of state community care licensing, 
said she waited until last week -- when The Times inquired into the status of 
the Jones home -- to ask attorneys in Sacramento to begin the time-consuming 
process of seeking an injunction to close the facility. Asked why she had not 
acted sooner, Blyth said, "I guess it's just a matter of training staff and 
keeping up with all the other cases we have to keep up with." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the 65-year-old Jones, who can't remember such details as her 
own age, is often left in charge of Jane's baby while Jane attends a day 
program sponsored by the regional center. Jones' son, whose criminal record 
reportedly includes assault with a deadly weapon, battery and burglary, lives 
in a house behind the facility and eats meals in his mother's home. 
</P>
<P>
Jane says she has had a total of three children, including a baby born while 
she was living at a community care home in Little Rock, Calif., several years 
ago. She said she gave up custody of that child. 
</P>
<P>
When Jane and Mary were relocated from the Jones home to the Salubrium, they 
found themselves in a neighborhood frequented by street hoodlums and drug 
dealers who frequently victimized residents of the home, according to Bobbie 
Jean Hopkins, operator of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Substandard Conditions 
</P>
<P>
The father of Jane's most recent child is a man she met in front of a liquor 
store one day on her way back to the Salubrium from church. 
</P>
<P>
The Salubrium has a long record of substandard conditions in the files of the 
state Department of Social Services. There are several pages listing citations 
for broken-down furniture, stained and worn mattresses and rooms needing 
cleaning and repainting. Licensing officials have scheduled a meeting for 
Tuesday to warn Hopkins to clean up the facility. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the case said that Salubrium staff members nailed boards 
over the window of the shabby little room that Jane and Mary shared in an 
attempt to keep Jane's boyfriend out of the facility at night. 
</P>
<P>
Jane gave birth to the baby in her room at the Salubrium late in May and she 
and the infant were subsequently taken to a hospital by ambulance. When Jane 
left the hospital with her new child, she was taken by the infant's father to 
the Jones Family Home because she feared she would not be allowed to keep the 
baby at the Salubrium. Mary, who sources say is mildly retarded and mentally 
ill -- as well as being militant in her pursuit of freedom of choice -- 
followed Jane to the Jones home the next day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women's Desires Cited 
</P>
<P>
Both women are adamant in their desire to stay at the Jones Family Home, which 
is a pleasant-looking Spanish-style house in a residential neighborhood. Jane 
and Mary share a cluttered bedroom, where the baby, who has no crib, sleeps 
with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Jane and Mary, say some advocates for the retarded, not only 
demonstrates the shortage of well-run community facilities and the frequent 
lack of communication between agencies serving the developmentally disabled, 
but also illustrates the conflict between the rights of retarded adults to 
freedom of choice as opposed to their need for protection against harm and 
exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson of the South Central Los Angeles Regional Center says that his social 
workers counseled Jane on birth control, but says that she ignored the advice. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Rhine, managing attorney for the Southern California Protection and 
Advocacy -- a federally funded legal agency responsible for protecting the 
rights of the retarded -- insists that people such as Jane have the right to 
live where they choose and to engage in sexual relationships with or without 
birth-control precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would argue that someone with an IQ of a 10- or 11-year-old 
shouldn't be having a baby. . . . I disagree with that vehemently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Good Parents 
</P>
<P>
"Some will be good parents," he said, "and some will be bad parents. . . . She 
(a retarded woman) has the right to feel sexual urges. . . . How is that 
different from the secretary who goes to a bar at night?" 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that public and private agencies are being paid with taxpayer 
funds to protect retarded clients from exploitation, says Frederic Hougardy, 
executive director of the Assn. for Retarded Citizens of California, a private 
organization that works for programs on behalf of the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"The tendency has been, when things get tough, for the care givers and other 
professionals involved to hide behind the clients' constitutional rights to do 
as they please," Hougardy said. 
</P>
<P>
"If all these people are powerless to prevent these destructive events from 
happening to their clients," he said, "maybe we should cash in their salaries 
and then clients could afford to live out of these slums and won't have half 
these problems, anyway."

MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS' FATE TO BE DECIDED IN SACRAMENTO

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future of public care for the mentally ill in Los Angeles County depends on 
whether the county's heavily Democratic legislative delegation and Republican 
Gov. George Deukmejian can bridge a huge policy gap that now separates them on 
the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Although the television news cameras focus on the weekly County Hall of 
Administration debates on endangered mental health outpatient clinics, the 
question of saving them will be decided in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The important players are not the Los Angeles County supervisors, but 
Deukmejian and three powerful Los Angeles lawmakers, Senate President Pro Tem 
David Roberti and two Assembly members close to Speaker Willie Brown of San 
Francisco -- Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos and Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Maxine 
Waters. That is because state funds largely support the county's 13 outpatient 
clinics and finance the care of impoverished mentally ill patients who have 
been committed to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
At this early stage in the negotiations over the $46-billion budget for the 
fiscal year beginning July 1, prospects for a compromise do not appear bright, 
according to Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Their appraisal follows two meetings in which Roberti and Brown discussed 
financing mental health care with Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said Deukmejian has insisted that the negotiations include possible 
elimination of cost-of-living increases in welfare programs sponsored by 
Democrats over the last few years. And Roberti and Brown have said the talks 
should include the possibility of raising taxes, which Deukmejian opposes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Speaker and I feel we have to put revenue enhancements on the table," 
Roberti said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But just the fact that the two sides are talking has made Assemblywoman Waters 
(D-Los Angeles), a tough critic of the governor, optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time the governor ever mentioned being amenable," said 
Waters, referring to the governor's expressed willingness to work out a 
solution with Democrats. "I think he is going to look for answers too. . . . I 
am going to keep an open mind and take him at his word." 
</P>
<P>
Hanging over the talks is the fact, acknowledged by both sides, that the state 
does not have enough money available to meet its obligations despite 
California's prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
"It all reflects the fact that although the state's economy is booming, its 
government is poor," said Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan, (D-Fresno), one of the 
Legislature's experts on mental health care. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democratic legislators have said their efforts have been weakened because 
the county supervisors, and the officials who work for them, have not worked 
hard enough to exert pressure on the governor. Like the governor, three of the 
five supervisors are Republicans, and one of them, Deane Dana, is a longtime 
Deukmejian ally. 
</P>
<P>
"The board majority is not putting the county on the line in the battle," 
Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) said. 
</P>
<P>
While not wanting to openly criticize county officials, Roberti said, "They 
don't grapple with all the options." 
</P>
<P>
The arithmetic of mental health care survival is complicated. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is this year. 
</P>
<P>
The county supervisors recently voted to close three of the county's dozen 
clinics for the mentally ill because of a shortage of county funds to keep them 
open. These centers, whose threatened closings have attracted widespread 
publicity, provide treatment to mentally ill who are not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Deukmejian and the Democratic leaders do not affect 
the immediate fate of the centers. Centered on the budget for the coming fiscal 
year, they will have an impact on the centers beginning uly 1. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has cited voter approval of Proposition 98, which required the 
allocation of large amounts of state funds to education, saying it forces him 
to cut other programs. In addition, he said, his hands are tied by the 
so-called Gann Limit, a restriction on state spending. 
</P>
<P>
He has also insisted on setting aside $1 billion as a "prudent reserve" fund. 
"That means we only have discretion over approximately 8% of the General Fund 
tax revenues," he said in January. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has said that if he does not get cost-of-living increases for 
welfare recipients eliminated next year, he will cut about $200 million in 
state support for the community mental health clinics. They now get almost $500 
million from the state. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean a reduction of about $80 million in aid to Los Angeles County 
-- now about $200 million a year -- for what is the state's biggest system of 
public mental health care. 
</P>
<P>
That total cut in funding would be made even greater by a recent key decision 
of county officials. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Los Angeles County contributed to the clinics more than the 
minimum required by state law. This year, the county's contribution could 
exceed $13 million, according to County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. 
Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
But the county cannot afford this any more, Dixon said, meaning there will be 
more cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas E. Reitz, deputy director of the State Department of Mental Health's 
Division of Community Programs, said officials are drawing up contingency plans 
if the Deukmejian cuts go through. 
</P>
<P>
Available dollars will be used for "the population which needs it most," Reitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those committed to hospitals -- 28% of the state's mentally ill population -- 
will get first priority in the allocation of funds, he said. Second priority 
will be given to those using the clinics, 66.5% of the mentally ill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly Ways 
and Means Subcommittee on Health and Welfare, said grass-roots groups must be 
mobilized in a campaign to pressure the Legislature and the governor if the Los 
Angeles clinics are to be helped. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said he is trying to recruit wealthy Westside Los Angeles liberals to 
finance a "sophisticated ad campaign as well as grass-roots involvement." 
</P>
<P>
The next big event in the fight will be the May estimates of state revenues. 
</P>
<P>
That will provide new information for the negotiators. In the end, the fate of 
the clinics will be decided in a few days of intense talk at the end of the 
legislative session in mid-June, when important matters are traditionally 
settled.

HOSPITAL USES METAL DETECTORS TO SCREEN ARMS; 
</P>
<P>
CITES GANG VIOLENCE, THREATS TO MEDICAL STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Metal detectors have been installed this week at two key entry points to Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Watts to screen out weapons carried into 
the hospital by growing numbers of "violent and unruly individuals," hospital 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 60 gang members at a time have converged on the 430-bed county hospital 
to visit their wounded friends or to intimidate rivals, said Robert Eason, the 
hospital's chief of safety police. 
</P>
<P>
They have barged into the emergency room, camped outside the third-floor 
operating rooms and marched up to the fifth-floor pediatrics ward, where people 
under 17 are treated, Eason said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Scared to Work Here' 
</P>
<P>
"People are scared to work here," said Bob McCloskey, business agent for Local 
660 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents nurses and 
other medical personnel at King. "The gang-bangers who come here are interested 
in seeing their partners live or their enemies die." 
</P>
<P>
Nurse Ethel Edmond recalled treating a patient about a year ago when his 
friends suddenly barged into the emergency room and threatened: "If he dies, 
you die." 
</P>
<P>
Edmond said she shot back: "If you really want to save your friend, go give 
some blood." They did. 
</P>
<P>
Tension in the emergency room escalates, Edmond said, "when rival gang members 
are in the emergency room at the same time. That's when the problems start. . . 
. Gangs come in to see how a member is or to retaliate." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrator William Delgardo said that so far "there has never been 
a shooting on the grounds." He called the metal detectors an "ounce of 
prevention." 
</P>
<P>
Eason said several Veterans Administration hospitals are protected by metal 
detectors, as is the psychiatric hospital at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Eason said, the safety officers at King are able to handle 
confrontations. But about a year ago, he said, gang members put the hospital 
under virtual siege. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that about five carloads of gang members arrived at the hospital 
and converged suddenly on the lobby of the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't catch them," Eason said. "They outnumbered us three to one. It 
happened so fast we had to ask the sheriff to bring help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Terrorizing People' 
</P>
<P>
Edmond recalled, "They were terrorizing people in the waiting room and they 
stole a janitor's cart." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff arrived with helicopters, cars and dogs. King personnel were 
ordered not to leave the hospital, and paramedics with other patients were 
directed into the hospital through a back door. 
</P>
<P>
In a bulletin issued this month to King personnel, Eason stated: "Our 
psychiatric and emergency rooms have been inundated with unruly and violent 
individuals that have caused considerable concern for personal safety. . . . 
The acquisition . . . of metal detectors will enable us to detect and 
progressively deter the presence of objects which are . . . used as weapons." 
</P>
<P>
"It's real scary working here," Edmond said. "Safety has been an issue for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
Eason said that he ordered three metal detectors two years ago but that they 
were delayed by budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
Two detectors -- each costing about $4,000 -- have just arrived. One has been 
set up at the entrance to the Augustus F. Hawkins Mental Health Building, which 
houses several out-patient psychiatric treatment programs and four in-patient 
wards. The other has been set up at the entrance to the pediatric wards, which 
have about 50 beds. They will be operative next week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remodeling Necessary 
</P>
<P>
A third metal detector is on order for the emergency room, Eason said. But the 
area will have to be substantially remodeled to accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
Edmond said that a metal detector for the emergency room would be "heaven. . . 
. It would be great." She said that patients have stashed butcher knives and 
other weapons in drawers in the emergency room. A few months ago, she said, a 
deranged man was apprehended in the emergency room lobby waving a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Safety concerns have made it extremely difficult to recruit nurses needed to 
fill more than 90 vacancies, she added.

MOTHER PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN STABBINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West Covina woman pleaded not guilty Wednesday to two counts of attempted 
murder and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon in connection with the 
Monday stabbings of her young son and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Patricia Shademan, 29, was arrested after police said they found blood 
splattered on the walls of her home and her 6-year-old daughter hiding under a 
bed with multiple stab wounds. Police had been called by a neighbor after the 
woman's 7-year-old son, who had also been stabbed, escaped through a window. 
</P>
<P>
Shademan was arraigned in Citrus Municipal Court and will appear today for a 
bail hearing. She remained in custody Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Shademan and her husband, who have been married 
10 years, told police that problems had surfaced in their relationship over the 
disciplining of the children and the mother's drinking. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, the condition of both children had been upgraded from critical to 
serious, according to a spokeswoman at Queen of the Valley Hospital. Both 
suffered collapsed lungs, she said.

TEACHERS PRESS BID FOR BRITTON OUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A petition drive aimed at getting Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. 
Leonard Britton fired has prompted an "overwhelming response" from the 
district's teachers, a spokesman for their union said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The United Teachers of Los Angeles, in bitter negotiations with the district 
over a new contract and already authorized by its members to prepare for a 
strike, accused Britton of having a "union-busting, anti-teacher record" and 
published the "Taxpayers Petition to Terminate the Services of Superintendent 
Britton" in the latest issue of the union newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Charging Britton with "a frightening insensitivity" to teachers and contending 
that his presence "threatens the district," the petition asks the board of 
education to fire him "effective immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Diana Munatones, spokeswoman for the district, called the move a "campaign of 
personal vilification" and called on UTLA President Wayne Johnson and the union 
to help resolve the salary issue "rather than shooting the messenger." 
</P>
<P>
It was the board, not Britton, she pointed out, that offered to raise salaries 
at least 20% over three years. The offer was rejected by the teachers.

CITY TO GET TOUGH ON FIRMS FAILING TO LIST PERILOUS MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aiming to get better compliance with a state hazardous chemical law, the Los 
Angeles City Council on Wednesday gave the Fire Department authority to shut 
down businesses that do not provide a detailed list of what dangerous materials 
are stored on their premises. 
</P>
<P>
A state law requiring businesses to inform fire departments of the types, 
amounts and locations of hazardous chemicals they use went into effect on Jan. 
1, 1988. Under the law, companies that have not complied face potential fines 
of $5,000 for every day that their lists are not submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure approved by the City Council, the fire chief will have the 
authority to close down non-complying companies. Mayor Tom Bradley said shortly 
after the council vote that he will sign the measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials conceded that they would rather get cooperation than 
force a business to close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'See the Light' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure with the threat of forced closure these companies will see the 
light," said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who proposed the measure. "I don't 
want to close anyone down. I just want to make this city a safer place to 
live." 
</P>
<P>
City fire officials, who supported the measure, said they intend to use the 
closure powers only as a tool of last resort. Nonetheless, "it would be a 
foolish company that would want to test us," city Fire Marshall Craig Drummond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department, like other local fire authorities around the state, so far 
has been reluctant to enforce the letter of the law. No fines have been issued 
in Los Angeles, and the city has taken no legal action against any companies, 
Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
While many companies are still late in reporting, Drummond said there are no 
cases of "flagrant disobedience." Much of the problem, he said, is in educating 
companies about the law and the chemicals they use. 
</P>
<P>
The city itself had problems in carrying out the law. For months after the 
reporting law took effect, fire officials conceded that their record-keeping 
was riddled with errors and they were unable to record the plans as quickly as 
they were submitted. Thousands of plans were simply kept in stacks, as workers 
attempted to get them filed onto department computers. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities and counties throughout the state were having similar problems, 
according to a 1988 study by the Assembly Office of Research. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reporting Requirements 
</P>
<P>
But in recent months, the Los Angeles Fire Department has cut the list of 
non-complying companies to just a few hundred, according to Drummond. He 
estimated that 95% of the estimated 8,000 companies storing hazardous materials 
in the city have complied with reporting requirements and those reports are on 
the department's computers. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the state law was to provide firefighters with vital information 
about what types of hazardous materials they might encounter in battling blazes 
at stores, warehouses and factories. 
</P>
<P>
The push to get tough with late filers in Los Angeles began last May, when a 
fire broke out at a Lincoln Heights hardware company that stored dangerous 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 residents near the blaze at Builders Hardware Finishers had to 
be evacuated. The company was one of hundreds that had not filed a plan with 
fire authorities. Residents complained that they had not been notified of the 
chemicals at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Molina then filed a series of motions to tighten enforcement and improve 
dissemination of the business plans.

MORE PUNISHMENT FOR SLUMLORD WHO STRAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted slumlord was ordered Wednesday to serve at least 45 days in jail 
after an electronic sensor attached to his ankle alerted authorities that he 
had violated the terms of his original sentence, which called for him to spend 
four months in one of his San Pedro apartments. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro Municipal Judge Roy Ferkich imposed the jail term on Martin Cantor, 
39, of Rancho Palos Verdes for violating the conditions of his house arrest by 
leaving the apartment to work at his father's liquor store on a Saturday and by 
going grocery shopping and tending to his laundry when he was not supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 17, Cantor was supposed to be spending his nights and weekends in a 
small apartment in a building in which Los Angeles County health officials 
found cockroaches, rats and "a hole the size of a bathtub filled with sewage 
water," according to the city attorney who prosecuted the landlord. 
</P>
<P>
But Cantor, who is permitted to leave the apartment during the week to go to 
work at his father's Torrance store, admitted in court Wednesday that he 
violated the court's order by going to the store on Saturday, March 4. 
</P>
<P>
When the electronic sensor attached to his ankle revealed that he was leaving 
the apartment that morning, Cantor told an employee of Electronic Supervision 
Services, the private company that is monitoring his movements, that it had 
been an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"You must understand," Ferkich lectured Cantor on Wednesday, "that there is no 
emergency that will allow you to go to your business on Saturdays or Sundays. . 
. . If you were spending this time in County Jail, they wouldn't let you out to 
do any grocery shopping or tend to an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Cantor will be released from jail after 45 days only if he makes 
the required repairs to his property or sells the building at at 2319 S. 
Pacific Ave., which Cantor says he is trying to do. But the landlord will serve 
up to 180 days in jail if the repairs are not made, Ferkich said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the new sentence, Cantor was also ordered to spend an extra 
30 days in his slum apartment. 
</P>
<P>
This is at least the second time that Cantor had been found in violation of a 
court order. He was sentenced to house arrest for violating his probation in a 
case involving three houses in Wilmington, in which county health officials 
found vermin and maintenance problems. 
</P>
<P>
"He deserves a harsher penalty, in my opinion," said Deputy City Atty. Juana 
Wedman, "but given that slum landlords are very rarely, if ever, sentenced to 
jail, I am satisfied."

JUDGE REJECTS PLEA-BARGAIN OFFER IN PAYOLA CASE, CITES POSSIBLE COERCION

<P>
A federal judge refused Wednesday to accept a proposed plea agreement with 
independent record promoter Ralph Tashjian and his wife, finding that Valerie 
Tashjian may have been "coerced" into pleading guilty to save her husband from 
additional criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I can make no finding the plea is warranted or that it is not coerced," U.S. 
District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer said of the package agreement, under which the 
couple had been scheduled to enter guilty pleas last month. 
</P>
<P>
Tashjian, 41, had intended to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of making 
undisclosed payments to a radio station to add his clients' records to their 
play lists and to two felony counts of filing false tax returns and obstruction 
of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Valerie Tashjian, who acted as a bookkeeper for her 
husband's promotion business, would have pleaded guilty to a charge of aiding 
in the preparation of a false tax return. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widening Probe 
</P>
<P>
Her plea was halted abruptly last month when she tearfully admitted that she 
was actually pleading guilty because she had been told that her husband might 
face additional charges in a widening nationwide payola investigation if she 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Tashjians and the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike 
Force differed on whether it was implicit throughout the plea negotiations that 
the government would not accept Tashjian's guilty plea without that of his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Strike force chief John Newcomer said the government made no intentional 
misrepresentations when it failed to mention the reciprocal nature of the 
agreements in the package presented to the court. 
</P>
<P>
But Tashjian's lawyer, Anthony P. Brooklier, said in court papers that 
government prosecutors specifically declined to include the language in the 
plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In their own papers, government prosecutors said they made it clear from the 
beginning that it would be impossible to allow Ralph Tashjian to plead guilty 
while his wife proceeded to trial. Tashjian could then testify in an attempt to 
free his wife of blame, without himself facing additional criminal charges, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Rymer scheduled Valerie Tashjian for trial on May 23 but did not schedule a 
trial date for her husband.

SHORTAGE OF FUNDS TO DELAY HIGHWAY PROJECTS IN STATE 
</P>

<P>
For the first time in 15 years, state administrators have advised the 
California Transportation Commission that a shortage of highway funds will 
force them to begin a policy of intentionally delaying construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
In an internal memorandum from Transportation Department Director Robert K. 
Best, the commission was told to expect the first "slowdown" to come in July 
and then be followed by increasingly longer delays. 
</P>
<P>
After the July hiatus, the memo showed, the department would advertise projects 
for bid in August and September and then shut down again in October and 
November. By February, 1990, the memo said, all federal funds for that fiscal 
year will have been spent and new projects will have to be delayed five months 
until the following August. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kind of like the foreshocks to the earthquake," said Allan Hendrix, 
chief of the department's division of highways and programming. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the projects most likely to be delayed include the extension 
of the Costa Mesa Freeway to 19th Street and the widening of the Santa Ana 
Freeway between the San Diego and the Costa Mesa freeways, county officials 
said. They cautioned, however, that Caltrans has not provided a list. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating Caltrans's action, county transportation officials have tried to 
prevent delays on the Santa Ana Freeway project by breaking it into short 
segments so that segments ready for construction would receive top priority. 
Caltrans's Orange County chief presented such a plan to state transportation 
officials at last month's California Transportation Commission meeting in Los 
Angeles and received a favorable response. State officials said "project 
readiness" would be a determining factor in committing highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ahead of Caltrans's problem, as far as I know," said Stanley T. Oftelie, 
executive director of the Orange County Transportation Commission, referring to 
the Santa Ana Freeway project. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials had warned for months that the five-year, $14-billion 
State Transportation Improvement Program faced at least a $3.5-billion deficit 
because gasoline tax and other highway user fees have not kept pace with 
inflation and demands for new construction. Legislative analysts later 
estimated the deficit at $4.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials had advised lawmakers that at some point they would have 
to begin juggling funds and delaying projects. The memo now provides the first 
firm indication of exactly when the department expects the delays to come and 
how long it expects each will last. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past several months, the department has identified for the commission 
an approaching slowdown in state highway construction, as our delivery of 
projects ready for advertising outpaces the availability of funds for these 
projects," Best wrote the commission. " . . . During the current federal fiscal 
year, we will deliver about $600 million of projects that exceed available 
funding." 
</P>
<P>
Best said the first delay might have come as soon as this month but officials 
were able to stave it off until July by "careful management of federal funds." 
</P>
<P>
"The department is attempting to stretch its money," said Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee. "At some 
point they are going to have to start laying off personnel and then gearing up 
again. We have been building up the department based on an expectation of funds 
and at some point you, don't need everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said it is too soon to name the specific projects that will be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
A department spokesman said some grading and paving work involved in the 
construction of the Century Freeway could be subject to a short delay, but he 
expects that contractors will be able to catch up quickly so the freeway could 
open on schedule in 1993. The 17.3-mile Century Freeway, constructed at a cost 
of $2 billion, will link the city of Norwalk with Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix said the money problems began in the mid-1980s with the passage of 
federal legislation and administrative rules that reduced the amount of federal 
money that was being poured into California for highway construction. He said 
state officials did not make a corresponding cutback in their planning for 
construction projects because they expected the federal losses to be made up by 
state funds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government provides 80% of the financing for most highway 
construction projects, with the states expected to pay the remaining 20%. 
</P>
<P>
When there was suddenly a shortage of state funds, Hendrix said, officials were 
forced to begin delaying projects. He said the first delay will come in July 
because federal funds for highway construction will be depleted in June. He 
said the department will be able to advertise projects for bid in August and 
September by, in effect, borrowing on anticipated federal funds which will 
become available in October. 
</P>
<P>
By October, he said the new funds will have been spent and the department will 
not be able to begin advertising again until December. At that point, he said, 
it can borrow against federal funds that will become available in January, 
1990. He said it expects those funds to be depleted by February. More will not 
be available, he said, until the following August. 
</P>
<P>
Although actual construction will be delayed, Hendrix said, engineering and 
designing will continue as if there is no shortage of funds. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the state intentionally ordered a slowdown on highway 
construction was in 1974, when state gas tax revenues "nose dived" as a result 
of the Arab oil embargo, Hendrix added. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for delaying projects came as lawmakers and private groups involved in 
transportation were preparing to meet with Gov. George Deukmejian in the next 
few weeks in a final effort to reach a compromise on the highway-financing 
issue. At two previous transportation "summits," Deukmejian, lawmakers and 
business and labor leaders agreed that an additional $20 billion will need to 
be pumped into the state's transportation system in the next decade to erase 
the deficit and to relieve traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of Californians for Better Transportation, a nonprofit group 
composed of business, labor and local government groups involved in 
transportation, said Wednesday that they fear that the governor may push for a 
compromise that would provide only a portion of the $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
David Ackerman, legislative representative of the Associated General 
Contractors of California, said Deukmejian had agreed that $20 billion will be 
needed but insisted at the same time that any gas tax increase should be 
subject to voter approval. To raise $20 billion, he said, a substantial gas tax 
increase -- probably as much as 10 or 12 cents per gallon -- would be needed, 
and polls show that the voters would never approve such a hike. 
</P>
<P>
In private meetings, Ackerman said, officials in the Deukmejian Adminstration 
had broached the possibility of a 5-cent gas tax increase, which some polls 
show could win voter approval.

POLITICIANS SEE LITTLE DAMAGE TO GATES SINCE NO PUNITIVE FINE AWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Reaction to the federal civil rights verdict against Orange County Sheriff Brad 
Gates came quickly Wednesday from his friends and foes, with politicians 
generally agreeing that Gates had not been badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fact that there were no punitive damages means he's pretty safe . 
. . ," state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said Wednesday. "He's not 
going to be hurt in the long run. . . . I think he's pretty well entrenched." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. Curtis, a former state Republican Party 
secretary still active in party politics, said he doubts that Gates need worry 
much about the verdict. "If it was a million-dollar punitive verdict, it would 
be a different story," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Guillory, a Gates opponent, was awarded $189,894 in damages but no 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, a prominent local Republican, was first elected in 1974 and won 
reelection to 4-year terms by easy margins of 57%, 75% and 64%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Won't Have an Impact' 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Padberg, who has managed Gates' past campaigns, said the sheriff was not 
really tried by a jury of his peers and "people who know him and support him 
will understand . . . ," she said. "It won't have an impact in a reelection 
campaign at all." 
</P>
<P>
Those with a stake in the verdict had varied reactions. 
</P>
<P>
County government was also held liable and will pay the judgment if it stands. 
County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley expressed relief because 
"I guess it could have been a lot more . . . ," he said. "They were talking $5 
million at one point -- although $190,000 is rough at a time when the county is 
in its current financial situation." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth said he wanted to reserve comment on the verdict but 
pointed out that Gates is "elected by the people and, you know, because of that 
I can't really tell him what to do. . . . He's responsible to the people." 
</P>
<P>
Former Anaheim Police Chief Jimmie D. Kennedy, a co-defendant with Gates, said 
the verdict exonerating him and other Anaheim officials was "a tremendous 
relief to me." He took the opportunity to endorse the Sheriff's Department as 
effective and committed. 
</P>
<P>
Mark A. Logan, Anaheim's chief prosecutor, said he was "grateful" that the jury 
cleared the city for its role in prosecuting Guillory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Suit 
</P>
<P>
Another lawsuit against Gates, one filed by newsman Chuck Cook, is pending in 
U.S. District Court. Cook alleges that Sheriff's Department intelligence unit 
investigators illegally tape-recorded one of his telephone conversations in an 
attempt to discover his sources for articles critical of Gates' operation of 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who was a reporter for the Orange County Register at that time but now 
edits a newspaper in Newhall, said he believes that his case is stronger than 
Guillory's. He said he does not expect Gates to escape punitive damages in that 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were still a voter in Orange County, I would have some serious concerns 
that the sheriff, one of our highest elected officials, was conducting illegal 
acts with a unit that is supposed to be guarding the community from organized 
crime and drug activity," Cook said Wednesday after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
He said the unit is no more than "a political spy unit" and "basically a dirty 
tricks unit."

RESIDENTS ON MYSTERY BEAM FIND IT A SIGNAL ANNOYANCE

Hundreds of homeowners in the east San Francisco Bay Area are being confounded 
by uncooperative automatic garage door openers, thanks to an unspecified 
government agency transmitting radio signals from a mountaintop, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know it's a government agency," Tom Hora, a spokesman with the Federal 
Communications Commission in Livermore, said Tuesday, "but we can't say which 
one." 
</P>
<P>
He said that residents who cannot tune the openers to another frequency can 
expect the problem to persist through May 2. 
</P>
<P>
Garage door companies have been swamped with complaints since Friday, when 
homeowners discovered nothing was happening when they pressed the buttons on 
the devices that normally save them the trouble of manually opening and closing 
the doors. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Cross of Cross Overhead Door Co. in Hayward, aware that automatic garage 
doors operate on radio signals, said he telephoned the FCC to demand an 
explanation for his sudden increase in service calls. 
</P>
<P>
Cross said the FCC told him that government transmissions were "saturating" 
some garage-door receivers. He said he was told that the signals were being 
transmitted from Mt. Diablo, which overlooks much of Contra Costa County. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Carr, salesman at Contra Costa Door Co. in Concord, said he has received 
up to 400 calls. "All we know is that there's radio interference in the air 
from some source -- we do not know why," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty has been reported in Concord, Orinda, Walnut Creek, Lafayette, 
Moraga, Danville, San Ramon and Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
Hora said the public was not forewarned because garage door openers are 
considered "unprotected devices," although they operate on radio frequencies 
used by the government and other authorized users. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not obligated to do anything," he said. "Normally, though, if anyone 
were to contact us, we would let them know what the situation is."

2 STUDENTS INVOLVED IN FIGHT WON'T BE CHARGED 
</P>

The Orange County district attorney's office said Wednesday that no charges 
will be filed against two high school students who were involved in a fight 
Sunday night at the Del Taco in the Woodbridge section of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The clash occurred in the parking lot of the restaurant at 4820 Barranca 
Parkway between a group of Irvine High School students and five young men in a 
car. Two teens were stabbed during the melee at the popular student hangout and 
two were struck by the car as the second group tried to leave the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Based upon a review of the evidence, we have decided not to prosecute the 
youths. We believe that the one youth with the knife was acting in self-defense 
and that the other who hit the girl did so unknowingly and accidentally," said 
Joe Nedza, an Orange County deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that a dispute between two groups of local high school 
students led to the fight. 
</P>
<P>
A group of five juveniles eating at the restaurant were confronted by another 
group. Words were exchanged and a fight broke out, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The five youths in the car did not provoke the fight and were actually trying 
to flee the scene, Nedza said. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver was parked in a head-in position at the restaurant. He had no 
choice but to back out. As he was doing this, his front and back windshields 
were being smashed by the crowd outside of the car," Nedza said. 
</P>
<P>
The "evidence indicates that the five in the car were trying to avoid the 
fight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although one of the teens in the car stabbed two males from the other group, 
Nedza said, police believe that he was acting in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The knife used by the youth resembled a Swiss-army type with a 2 1/2-inch 
blade, Irvine Police Lt. Michael White said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the incident, the three injured males -- two were stabbed and one was 
struck by the car -- have been treated at area hospitals and released. The one 
woman, Eileen Shelly, 18, of Irvine, remained in critical condition Wednesday 
at Western Medical Center in Anaheim with several broken bones and internal 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the other participants in the fight were not released by 
authorities because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real tragedy -- especially for the girl who got run over," White 
said. "Apparently she was trying to be a peacemaker."

PRO-CHOICE PROTESTERS GATHER AT CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In one of the county's first confrontations of its kind, a pro-choice group on 
Wednesday night carried out a protest at a Laguna Hills church whose pastor is 
active in sit-ins and blockades of anti-abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying lighted candles and signs with pro-choice slogans, about 26 protesters 
peacefully greeted Stone Mountain Church members with chants of "Pro-choice, 
pro-life," and "You run your body, let me run mine." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to let them know we do not appreciate what they're doing," said 
Patti Headland-Wauson, one of the organizers of Wednesday's protest. "It's 
about time they walked through us. We're on the defensive so much . . . we 
wanted to let them know how it felt." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters belong to the loosely knit Orange County Pro-Choice Coalition of 
individuals from feminist groups such as the National Organization for Women, 
Planned Parenthood and United Feminist Network. They are not connected with 
vandalism that occurred at the Garden Grove field headquarters of Operation 
Rescue last week, Headland-Wauson said. 
</P>
<P>
Stone Mountain's Pastor Randy Adler, a local leader of Operation Rescue, a New 
York-based organization that defies court-ordered injunctions in blockading 
abortion clinics, hurriedly stepped past the protesters and into the church 
without comment. 
</P>
<P>
Adler's fiery rhetoric and literature have called for the "death penalty for 
all parties" involved in an abortion, including the patient, father, doctor, 
nurse and receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice advocate Barbara Martinez of Planned Parenthood said in an interview 
before the protest, "It is essential that Orange County understands what we're 
dealing with. We don't accept this kind of rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
Not many church members took notice of the protesters. Most just strode into 
the small, nondenominational, charismatic church where Adler spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"The pro-choice people are verbally very provocative," said church member Steve 
Madison of Capistrano Beach, who laughed at protesters. "They're real media 
hounds." 
</P>
<P>
Adler said he believes that doctors who perform abortions should be convicted 
of felonies and that women who obtain abortions are accessories. He neither 
confirmed nor denied that he would seek the death penalty for women who obtain 
abortions. "If you say anything about the woman (being criminalized), they say 
you don't have any compassion," he said.

KILLINGS OF PETS SPARK ANGRY CRIES FOR ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of North Tustin and nearby areas jammed a community meeting Wednesday 
night and demanded that local officials coordinate an aggressive investigation 
into the killings and apparent mutilations of cats and other animals in the 
vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
At an emotional meeting of the North Tustin Municipal Advisory Council, 
residents threatened to walk out when council members indicated they wanted to 
think over recommendations prepared by a Noth Tustin resident before forwarding 
them to the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The outcry was so forceful from more than 100 people in attendance that the 
eight-member advisory council instead merely amended the resolution and 
approved it unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution recommends that supervisors immediately set up a central 
reporting agency for the incidents and launch a public information campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The animal deaths were made public this month by Janet Hampson a North Tustin 
resident who has been collecting reports from neighbors and from people in 
Orange and Tustin since last May, when a cat that belonged to her father's 
next-door neighbor, veterinarian James Connoyer, was found on a lawn cut neatly 
in two with its heart and liver missing. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hampson, a free-lance political consultant who owns three cats, 
said she has compiled reports involving nearly 50 animals, a handful of which 
were simply reported as missing. In addition to cats, the reports include a few 
cases involving rabbits, gerbils, birds and opossums. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the resolution's ultimate passage, some of the residents, who came from 
North Tustin, Tustin, Santa Ana, Orange and as far away as Brea, stormed out of 
the meeting, accusing council members of trying to hide from the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to hear us," one woman shouted as she kicked a folding chair 
and stormed from the meeting room at the Guin Foss Adult Education Center. 
</P>
<P>
The council is an elected body that advises the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors and county agencies on matters affecting the unincorporated area of 
North Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Brace, a member of the council, said earlier that she wanted the matter 
brought before the council because many North Tustin residents were living in a 
climate of fear as a result of the recent deaths of animals and because there 
did not seem to be much coordination among the various law enforcement agencies 
that had been contacted. 
</P>
<P>
Brace said two of her neighbors' cats had been found cut into pieces in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Since news accounts of Hampson's findings were published, similar reports have 
flooded in from all over the county, Hampson said. The reports are based solely 
on descriptions given to her by the owners of the animals or the person who 
found their bodies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday night's meeting, some residents reported that they had found 
animal parts on numerous occasions spread on and around school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
A common thread is that the animals appeared to have been cut with sharp 
instruments rather than by a larger animal's teeth or claws, and that the body 
parts and the areas around them appeared to be devoid of blood. In some cases, 
according to people contacted by The Times, body parts and organs appeared to 
have been washed and arranged in deliberate patterns on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Keith and Terri Hayes of Orange told a reporter that they found their cat's 
head sitting upright on their lawn last September with the paws neatly set in 
front of it. Connoyer, whose cat, Keoke, was killed last May, said he 
subsequently saw the carcasses of two of his neighbors cats and they also had 
been cut in half. Connoyer, who worked as an emergency veterinarian at a pet 
clinic for 4 years, said it was "hard for me to imagine that these were typical 
of attacks by dogs or coyotes." 
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday night meeting, Jack Edwards, the county's chief of animal 
control field services, told the council that many of the killings had been 
done by coyotes, but he conceded for the first time that some of the animals 
had "been killed by human hands." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Paddock, an Orange County sheriff's investigator who also attended the 
meeting, told the gathering that much of the problem stems from the fact the 
cases have not been reported to the proper agency. 
</P>
<P>
Paddock said the Sheriff's Department has on record only two reports of animal 
mutilations, the last of which came in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Both Paddock and Edwards urged residents to patrol their neighborhoods, report 
suspicious activity, and, as Edwards said, "get tough." 
</P>
<P>
Hampson and some of her neighbors have said they suspect the killings were done 
deliberately by humans, possibly by Satan worshipers. She said literature on 
satanic cults points out that some worshipers not connected to recognized 
satanic churches have been known to kill animals for their blood and body parts 
and to arrange parts and organs in patterns on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Such groups, according to "The Satan Hunter" by occult investigator Thomas W. 
Wedge, typically are alienated young people who engage in shocking activities 
to cover up their sense of powerlessness.

BOLERO LOOKOUT TOWERS NO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly half a century, the Bolero Lookout withstood the elements atop a 
lonely peak in Orange County's Santa Ana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But it took a bulldozer only 20 minutes to bring the two-story wooden structure 
crashing to earth Wednesday as the Orange County Fire Department demolished the 
county's last remaining fire lookout -- and along with it, yet another remnant 
of the county's rustic past. 
</P>
<P>
"God, they're finally gonna do her in; the last of our landmarks," Capt. John 
Sleppy a 27-year veteran of the Fire Department, murmured sadly to himself as 
he surveyed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The lookout, visible until Wednesday from nearby Santiago Canyon Road, had been 
one of three that local fire officials built in the mountains immediately after 
World War II, when Orange County consisted primarily of farms and ranches. 
</P>
<P>
The other two were atop mile-high Santiago Peak -- Orange County's highest 
point -- and Gilman Peak, near Carbon Canyon in the northern part of the 
mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
From these towering vantage points, designated spotters would scan the horizon 
for any sign of smoke or fire, alerting fire crews by radio or telephone when 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
When they weren't spotting fires, the lookouts would endure such rigors as 
ejecting rattlesnakes from outhouses and fighting off swarms of bees. They also 
waited fearfully as howling windstorms and driving rain threatened to topple 
the rickety structures, which were built by state prison work crews. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1960s, however, Fire Department Capt. Bill Glover said, smog had reduced 
visibility to the point that lookouts were rendered virtually useless. The Fire 
Department, at the same time, built so many new fire stations around the county 
that lookout towers were no longer considered crucial, Glover added. 
</P>
<P>
So, one by one, the county tore them down. 
</P>
<P>
Bolero Lookout -- the lone holdout for the past decade -- finally was put to 
the bulldozer's blade after recent Santa Ana winds left the rickety structure 
tilted to one side, ready to collapse on anyone who might try to climb it. Fire 
officials then decided that the lookout was too much of a safety hazard to 
leave intact. 
</P>
<P>
As fire officials organized the demolition -- shuttling two vanloads of invited 
media representatives to the top of 1,600-foot Bolero Peak -- Sleppy and other 
veteran firefighters reminisced about the old lookout and some of the colorful 
people who used to man it. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among the latter group is a woman, now dead, named Lois Smith. A 
full-time paid lookout for the county for several years during the 1960s, Smith 
and the other lookouts tended the towers during fire season, which runs from 
June through October. They would work 10 days on, 5 days off. 
</P>
<P>
Sleppy watched glumly as the old landmark came down. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sad," Sleppy said, "because I am one of the old-timers in the 
county. I remember when there were no houses. . . . But the old has to make way 
for the new. That's just a fact of life."

KRAFT JURORS TO BE SEQUESTERED AT HOTEL TO AVOID MEDIA INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin broke the news to jurors in the Randy 
Steven Kraft murder trial Wednesday that they will be sequestered during their 
deliberations. He also told them that the target date for that should be 
mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 43, a Long Beach computer consultant, is on trial in Santa Ana charged 
with 16 murders. If convicted, his case would go into a penalty phase in which 
prosecutors say they could present evidence that Kraft committed 29 other 
murders in Southern California, Oregon and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin told the jurors that they will have single rooms -- instead of two 
jurors sharing a room -- in a nice hotel and will be allowed visitors on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"We rarely sequester anymore, but in the abundance of caution . . . I believe 
this is the best way to assure you won't be exposed to any news media publicity 
during your deliberations," McCartin told them. 
</P>
<P>
The judge told the seven alternate jurors that he will place them on call 
during the deliberations but warned them that they might have to return if the 
trial moves into a penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also told the jurors that they could have a 4-day Easter holiday next 
week, with testimony presented only on Monday. When they return March 27, the 
judge said, he will listen to any of the members of the 10-woman, 2-man jury 
for whom sequestering might pose a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
The judge added that the jurors could set their own timetable during the week 
on how long each day they want to deliberate but that he will not permit 
deliberations on Saturdays or Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin joked with the jurors about the sequestering arrangements, at first 
telling them that they would be staying at the Bates Motel, the fictional motel 
made famous in the "Psycho" movies. He also joked that those who are unmarried 
will be permitted to place boyfriends or girlfriends on their visitors' list. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's try to keep this to the immediate family," he said. "I don't want 
you inviting your ninth cousins to the hotel for the weekend."

WILLIAM PHILLIPS, FORMER 4-TERM COUNTY SUPERVISOR, DEAD AT 72 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William J. Phillips, a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors from 
1957 to 1973, died Wednesday in Fullerton after a 10-year struggle with 
Alzheimer's disease. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, known for his support of John Wayne Airport, served four terms on the 
board representing the 3rd District. 
</P>
<P>
As a supervisor, Phillips' often fiery style earned him political enemies but 
always seemed to endear him with his district's voters. They returned him to 
office three consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
But the supervisor's political style apparently caught up with him during his 
bid for a fifth term. Phillips was soundly defeated by Ralph A. Diedrich, then 
a Fullerton city councilman, who employed a $100,000-plus campaign to defeat 
the longtime political patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
(After ousting Phillips, riding a ticket that promised to get rid of the "old 
school" of county politics, Diedrich was later to be convicted of soliciting a 
bribe from a developer and of hiding the source of campaign contributions. 
Diedrich resigned in 1979 and served a prison term that ended with his parole 
in 1983.) 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who worked on experimental aircraft at Lockheed Corp. during World 
War II, maintained an interest in aviation throughout his life. He is often 
credited with helping turn what was a dusty old military airport into what is 
now John Wayne Airport. Family members described him as a leading proponent of 
highway, airport and airspace planning for the county. 
</P>
<P>
He was a past president of the Southern California Aviation Council and a 
member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He also 
served as a member of the President's Commission on Science and Technology, 
working in the area of jet noise abatement. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was a 50-year resident of Orange County. His public service included 
chairing a committee on air and water pollution and solid waste disposal for 
the National Assn. of County Officials. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is survived by his wife, Grace M. Phillips of Fullerton; children 
Pamela Brosnan of Santa Rosa, William J. Phillips II of Sebastopol, Stephanie 
J. Carvalho of La Habra and Jeffrey C. Phillips of Santa Rosa, and 10 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
His family asked that in lieu of flowers, donations be forwarded to the 
Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County. Public services for Phillips will be at 11 
a.m. Saturday at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Fullerton.

Huntington Beach is sponsoring a competition to select an artist to create a 
painting of the Municipal Pier. The landmark was closed for repair last year. 
</P>
<P>
The city is seeking an artist to focus on the human element of the pier, as a 
place where people came for more than 70 years to stroll, meet friends, fish, 
contemplate and watch the surfers. 
</P>
<P>
The competition is open to artists living in Southern California. The deadline 
for submission is May 1.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / BARBIE LUDOVISE; 
</P>
<P>
MAKING ENDS MEET HASN'T BEEN SMOOTH SAILING FOR CREW TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbie Ludovise 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How does a collegiate crew team keep itself afloat? Financially speaking, it 
can be a doozy. Just ask UC Irvine Coach Larry Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to popular belief, we don't do bake sales," Moore said. "Though we've 
tried just about everything else." 
</P>
<P>
This season, and recent seasons past, the Anteaters have raised funds by . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Taking inventory at local department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ticket-taking and ushering at Irvine's Crawford Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Decorating and cleaning up after a school sock hop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Staging all-night frozen yogurt sales. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Passing out 30,000 flyers announcing the opening of the Bren Events Center 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, selling candy bars and raffle tickets, as well as customized 
lithographs of themselves created and signed by local artist Ruth Hynds. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Anteaters made $750 filming a television commercial with 
Arnold Schwarzenegger for a Japanese noodle company. The athletes could do the 
commercial because the sport is not under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
rules, according to Moore. 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial, Arnold eats the noodles, then, rowing alone in a tiny dingy, 
proceeds to blow away the entire eight-man Irvine crew. 
</P>
<P>
Who says fund raising isn't glamorous? 
</P>
<P>
Only three months ago, Irvine athletic administrators, searching for a way to 
trim $70,000 from its budget, seriously considered dropping crew -- a 
non-scholarship but partially funded sport. 
</P>
<P>
But with the support of past coaches, alumni and former Irvine Chancellor Dan 
Aldrich -- a longtime crew supporter -- the program has been given a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rob Halvaks, senior associate athletic director, crew will receive 
a total budget -- to include coaches' salaries, travel, equipment, uniforms, 
etc. -- of $40,000 this year, a $30,000 decrease from last year's total budget 
of $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, crew spent $111,000, which included its share of the Irvine budget 
and money raised during the season. 
</P>
<P>
According to Moore, the average fully equipped, eight-man boat costs about 
$18,000 ($26,000 for a premium imported model). Oars are $250 apiece. Annual 
travel expenses are a minimum of $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
And the Irvine crew base dock, built 25 years ago, is in serious need of 
renovation. Cost: $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although crew supporters weren't thrilled with the 30% budget decrease, it was 
a much better option than their only other option -- having no crew at all. 
</P>
<P>
Former Irvine coach Duvall Hecht, who started the university's crew program in 
1965, is not unhappy with the university's decision to trim the crew budget. In 
fact, Hecht said the time has come for the Anteater crew alumni to come 
together and support the program. 
</P>

"It's time for the alumni to do more and to be more organized and active," said 
Hecht, who, along with Aldrich and former Irvine oarsmen Bruce Ibbetson and 
Paul Ryan, is beginning to organize a full-fledged alumni fund-raising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not right to think someone should do everything else for you. We've been 
given 20 years of support from the university. It's not like they're stopping 
completely. UCI is not turning us out of the nest, they're just saying we need 
to help out a little more. I think it's terrific. I think we're a mature 
program now, and we have some alumni who can help." 
</P>
<P>
Ibbetson, a two-time U.S. Olympian in rowing, is the co-chairman of the 
fund-raising committee, called the Irvine Rowing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people that have been involved (with Irvine crew) understand the value 
of the program and the success it brings not only to the individual, but to the 
university as well," Ibbetson said. "No one wants to see that just die and go 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Especially the current Irvine crew. 
</P>
<P>
Moore says he has yet to make his final decision of which varsity oarsmen will 
fill the top boat for Irvine's season opener, the San Diego Crew Classic, March 
31-April 1 at Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The varsity boat is named Myrmecophaga Jubata Irvinus, Latin for "Giant 
Anteater of Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
"About 12 different guys are being considered right now," Moore said. "And it's 
a tossup between two coxswains. This is the time where I find that all of a 
sudden things begin to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has some 60 athletes out for crew this year. Of the potential varsity 
members, only three are seniors. "Realistically, we hope to make the finals of 
the (Pacific Coast Rowing Championships) this year," Moore said. "And getting 
fifth or sixth there would be great . . . But next year looks a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's sailing team, the defending national champion, is the top-ranked team 
in the nation, according to Sailing World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Irvine won the Trux-Ulmstead Regatta, the largest collegiate 
regatta of the season, at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. "This win was 
really important for us," Irvine Coach Craig Wilson said. "A lot of the other 
top teams really sort of thought we wouldn't be a threat when we came east. 
Last year, we won the national championship in the West (at San Francisco). So 
a lot of the Eastern teams thought we wouldn't be able to handle their 
conditions. They sort of wrote us off." 
</P>
<P>
After Irvine, Old Dominion is ranked second, Navy is third and Charleston is 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine hammer thrower Mike Morales became the first Anteater to qualify for the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. outdoor track and field championships 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA meet will be May 30-June 3 at Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, a junior, broke his school record by three feet with a throw of 
203-feet 1-inch to win the event at a triangular meet at Santa Barbara. Morales 
also won the shotput and discus events at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen Lana Banks (400 meters), Andrea Sansom (800 meters) and Sabrina Miles 
(shot put) each recorded victories to lead Irvine's women's team to a 91-43 
victory over UC Santa Barbara Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 30-member women's squad, only two-time All-American distance runner Beth 
McGrann is a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine notes 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Kevin Floyd and Mike Doktorczyk were named most valuable players of 
Irvine's basketball team Monday. Floyd scored 995 points in his career, ranking 
No. 11th on the school's all-time list. Doktorczyk, who was named to the Big 
West Conference's second team, led Irvine in scoring (15.9 points) and 
rebounding (7.8) this season. Sophomore forward Jeff Herdman, of Mission Viejo 
High School, was named Irvine's shooter of the year. Herdman made 42 of 82 
three-point attempts (51%) and led the nation in three-point shooting in 
mid-February. Other award winners were Ricky Butler (newcomer of the year), Rod 
Palmer (hustle award) and Don May (most inspirational).

BOUNDARIES TO SHIFT FOR ALL-STAR GAME

<P>
Pat Quinn, who led Saddleback High School into the Southern Section's 5-AA 
division title game, and Steve Keith, who led Irvine into the 5-A division 
title game, were named the boys' coaches for the Orange County All-Star 
basketball game June 25 in UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Pickler of Savanna and Stan DeMaggio of Capistrano Valley were named as 
coaches for the girls' game, which will be a preliminary to the boys' game. 
</P>
<P>
Pickler will coach the north girls' team after leading Savanna to a 
school-record 18 victories this season. DeMaggio will coach the south team. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' game, Quinn will coach the north and Keith will coach the south 
under a revised format for selecting participants. 
</P>
<P>
The boundary for selecting coaches and members of the teams will be the Costa 
Mesa Freeway continuing north through Placentia and Yorba Linda. Schools on the 
west side of the freeway will designated as the north schools and the schools 
to the east will be designated as South schools. 
</P>
<P>
The north will be composed of 49 schools, including members of the Sunset 
League, Mater Dei, Santa Ana, Servite and Saddleback. The south will be 
composed of 25 schools, including members of the South Coast League, Corona del 
Mar and Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Garden Grove Freeway served as the dividing line for selecting 
the teams, but a recent shift in population in the Irvine, Mission Viejo and El 
Toro areas prompted the change. The North boys trail in the series, 13-10.

STAYING UP FOR THE PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
GOMEZ IS GETTING HER ACT TOGETHER AT KATELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angie Gomez's basketball teammates at Katella High School have tabbed her Gogo, 
because she's always going; Mags, a skewed acronym for her given name -- Maria 
De Los Angeles Gomez; Street, because of her wild, aggressive style of play, 
and Moody, because she is -- very. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Gomez, the starting point guard and team smart aleck, sets the 
mood for the Knights. When she's in a funk, morale dips on the team. 
</P>
<P>
But she can also swing the team mood upward with a well-placed joke. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Gomez has decided she's in the mood for success. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, who averaged a bit less than seven points a game during Empire League 
play, scored 14 points in the Knights' 50-43 victory over Muir in the 
semifinals of the Southern California Regional Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the championship game, she made nine of 16 shots for 19 points and played 
aggressive defense to help the Knights come back for a 56-50 victory over 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights' leading scorer, Joni Easterly, was cold against Vista, and if 
Gomez hadn't picked up the slack, Katella probably would not be making a trip 
to Oakland, Katella Coach Barb Bausch said. 
</P>
<P>
Katella will play Sacramento Grant at 2:45 p.m. Saturday in the Oakland 
Coliseum for the Division II girls' state title. 
</P>
<P>
It's a game Gomez's teammates hope she is "up" for. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to not worry about anything because basketball is most important 
right now," said Gomez, a 5-foot-6, 132-pound scrappy defensive guard with 
quick hands who loves to fast break and throw full-court passes. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken most of high school for Gomez, 18, to get a handle on her moods. 
</P>
<P>
She arrived at Katella her freshman year afraid and alone. Because of district 
boundaries, all her friends from Sycamore Junior High School went to Anaheim 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go out for basketball or soccer because I was a wimp," said Gomez, a 
senior. But she got a little bolder as the school year progressed and decided 
to go out for softball. She made the varsity and last season was voted 
all-Empire League as a left fielder with a .379 batting average. She struck out 
only eight times all year. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Harless, the softball coach, was also an assistant basketball coach, and 
she persuaded Gomez to go out for the basketball team her sophomore year. Gomez 
did. 
</P>
<P>
She made the junior varsity basketball team and the varsity soccer team, but 
quit soccer before playing in a game. 
</P>
<P>
"There was more discipline in basketball than in soccer, more togetherness," 
Gomez said. "It was more like a team. They were all individuals on the soccer 
team. We are like a family here. We do everything together." 
</P>
<P>
Even interview. 
</P>
<P>
The "family" describes Gomez as everything from awesome to bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
"The word is unpredictable," said Easterly, the Knights' leading scorer with 22 
points a game. The unpredictability goes for Gomez's play as well as her 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
She alternates between smiles and wisecracks, and what her sister Theresa calls 
"that mean-dog look." Gomez, her sister and a life-size poster of Michael 
Jordan share a room in the family's comfortable Anaheim home. 
</P>
<P>
"Two games in a row, she'll do awesome, then she'll go back to average," said 
Ruth Harker, the Knights' backup point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"She could be awesome every game," Easterly said. "It's all in her head." 
</P>
<P>
"But lately she's been going up," said Karri Johnson, a junior forward. 
</P>
<P>
"And she's not going to go down," Harker said. 
</P>
<P>
"She is definitely a special situation," Bausch said. "You can see Angie does 
stand out among the team, she is the nonconformist." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez can go into a mood quickly and take herself right out of a game if she 
thinks she has been criticized unjustly, Bausch said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think she knew her importance and how she affected the team," 
Bausch said. "Later on, she finally realized her mood or attitude does affect 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gomez, "If I'm mad at one thing, I get mad at everything. I ignore 
everybody and just go into my own little world." 
</P>
<P>
It took an iron hand disguised in a kid-gloves approach from Bausch to set 
Gomez straight. 
</P>
<P>
Bausch has tolerated Gomez's off-beat humor and tendency to talk back, but she 
has also kicked Gomez out of practice twice this season and limited her playing 
time for Gomez's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take so much, and when she starts hurting the team, I say forget it," 
Bausch said. "If she's going to screw up the team, we don't need her around. I 
showed her we can play without her. 
</P>
<P>
"She thought about it, and I think kicking her out has helped, because it has 
given her time to think, 'That wasn't right what I did, and it hurt the team.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Gomez says she has learned from Bausch's discipline. "I changed my attitude the 
last half of the season. If somebody keeps telling you you have an attitude, it 
kind of gets old, it kind of gets to your head," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I noticed every time my attitude was bad in practice, I wouldn't get 
as much playing time, so I had to change," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bausch: "(Two years ago) she talked to basically nobody. She didn't like 
to be touched, just left alone. She never smiled. She was just a hard, stern 
person. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, (as second-string varsity point guard) she was an individual. 
Through the past two years, she has learned what a team means. It's great to 
see her smile and go and hug somebody now. It's great to see she knows how to 
show the team that she cares." 
</P>
<P>
Bausch has always believed Gomez could average 15 points a game. Getting Gomez 
to believe was the key. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning of the season I didn't believe I could score points and have 
a good game," Gomez said. "But lately I've been saying, 'Yes, I can have a good 
game.' I scored high once; why can't I do it again?"

TITAN WOMEN LOSE NCAA OPENER TO MONTANA, 82-67 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's first trip to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
women's basketball tournament ended abruptly Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
With leading scorer Gena Miller in foul trouble much of the game, the Titans 
lost to the University of Montana, 82-67, in a first-round Western Regional 
game in front of 6,074 at Missoula, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
Montana (27-3), which has 22 consecutive victories, will play the University of 
Texas in the second round Saturday night at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The Grizzlies scored the first six points and never trailed. They were leading, 
14-11, with 10 minutes 2 seconds left in the first half when Miller picked up 
her third foul. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was outscored, 24-8, and trailed, 38-19, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who averaged 20 points per game, picked up her fourth foul at the 7:14 
mark of the second half and fouled out with 4:37 left. She scored 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't really trying to get her into foul trouble," Montana Coach Robin 
Selvig said. "We didn't want to get out of our game plan. But I'm glad she did 
get some fouls. It really hurt them when she went out." 
</P>
<P>
Montana outrebounded Fullerton, 42-37. The Grizzlies also blocked five shots. 
</P>
<P>
With Miller out of the game, the Grizzlies extended their zone to take away the 
Titans' outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (21-9) shot 36% for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Maytuch, one of Fullerton's best outside shooters, made six of 21 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we'd shoot better from the outside," Fullerton Coach Maryalyce 
Jeremiah said. "I think the thing they realized is that we don't have much 
scoring from the point (guard)." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton did a good job on Lisa McLeod, Montana's leading scorer. She made 
five of 12 shots. But McLeod's teammates picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
Jean McNulty made 11 of 17 shots and finished with a game-high 22 points. The 
Grizzlies also received strong games from Shannon Cate (16 points) and Vicki 
Austin (14). Montana shot 54%. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their athletic ability is not as good as some of the teams in our 
conference, but they execute great," Jeremiah said. "Teams in our conference 
probably have more quickness and depth. But execution is what makes them good." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans never got closer than 14 points in the second half. McLeod scored 10 
of her 16 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Felicia Benson made seven of 11 shots and scored a season-high 19 points for 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can play much better than that," Selvig said. "They're a very 
good team; Miller is a great player. We can't play much better defense and we 
shot great."

RANCHO SANTIAGO BEATS CYPRESS IN SOFTBALL, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christa Lawson's run-scoring single in the seventh inning gave Rancho Santiago 
a 3-2 victory over Cypress in an Orange Empire Conference softball game 
Wednesday at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson's hit scored Natalie Sanchez from third in the bottom of the seventh. 
Cypress led, 2-1, entering the bottom of the seventh, but Rancho Santiago tied 
the score on a squeeze bunt by Heather Dearden. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez (11-5) earned the victory. Sally Dugas took the loss. Rancho Santiago 
is 11-6 overall, 3-1 in conference play. Cypress is 1-3 in conference. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 3, Orange Coast 0 -- Kristin Jacobs of Fullerton (15-7, 5-0) had a 
perfect game into the seventh inning, but gave up a walk and a single. She also 
had nine strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 2, Riverside 0 -- Erika Ostergaard pitched a one-hitter to lead host 
Saddleback (14-8, 3-2). Stacy Martinck had a run-scoring triple for the 
Gauchos. Riverside falls to 0-5 in conference play.

GUNMEN HIT 5 O.C. FIRMS IN 6 MONTHS; 
</P>
<P>
CROOKS TRYING TO CASH IN ON COSTLY COMPUTER CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Some computer chips are as good as gold, and that means they are attracting a 
new kind of professional to the computer industry -- the armed robber. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 6 months, gunmen have burst into at least five Orange County 
computer firms and stolen or attempted to steal bundles of the tiny but 
expensive chips that keep computers humming. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been seriously injured in the late-night attacks, although one guard 
at AST Research Inc. in Irvine was roughed up, police and company officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The holdups appear to be the latest -- and perhaps the boldest -- strategy by 
crooks to take and resell computer parts, especially dynamic random access 
memory chips and central processing unit chips. 
</P>
<P>
Both are major components in computer systems, which typically contain one CPU 
and 72 to 144 DRAMs. Retail prices for CPUs range from $80 to $500 apiece. The 
price of DRAMs has skyrocketed to as much as $200 apiece because of a worldwide 
shortage last year. 
</P>
<P>
Before the rash of robberies, police in places like Irvine had arrested 
employees of high-technology firms and others for taking chips home in their 
pockets or purses or directing shipments of chips to friends' homes. Burglars 
have also been caught trying to steal chips. 
</P>
<P>
The average DRAM is about 1 inch square, and about 1,500 chips with a street 
value of $10 each can be stuffed into an ordinary grocery store bag, said John 
King, chairman of UC Irvine's information and computer science department. 
</P>
<P>
"According to some of the crooks we've caught, there's a shortage of DRAMs, and 
the crooks have little difficulty in disposing of them," Irvine Police Lt. 
Michael White said. "One crook put an ad in the Pennysaver and sold them all." 
</P>
<P>
DRAMs actually have dropped in price in recent months and have become more 
available. But that hasn't stopped the thefts, which increased last year and 
are still going strong, said Ken Rosenblatt, a Santa Clara County deputy 
district attorney specializing in high-tech crime. 
</P>
<P>
But the armed robberies "seem to be a new phenomenon," White said. Four of the 
five robberies occurred in Irvine; the other was in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
White said he is working with police in Stanton and other cities as well as 
with state and county agencies to come up with leads. None of the robberies 
have been solved. 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident occurred about 10:30 p.m. Monday when four thugs armed with 
a .45-caliber handgun and an automatic weapon, believed to be a submachine gun, 
walked into Advanced Logic Research Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Some cleaning women were sitting on the stairs, and when they saw these people 
come in, they screamed and ran upstairs," said David Kirkey, the company's vice 
president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The women ran to another part of the company's headquarters and plant, locked a 
door and called police, Kirkey said. The would-be robbers ran off without 
taking anything, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not So Lucky 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County firms haven't been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 30, two armed bandits forced an unarmed security guard at a Western 
Digital Corp. plant in Irvine to open an area where chips are stored. They 
bound the guard and fled with $105,000 worth of DRAMs. Retail prices for the 
chips range from $10 to $200 each, and the crooks "in all probability" will 
sell them at swap meets or on the street, said Gordon Graves, the company's 
vice president for sales operations. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, four robbers with rifles bound and blindfolded two unarmed guards 
at an AST Research facility, roughing up one of them in the process, and made 
off with six completed computer systems and three color monitors worth a total 
of $17,000. Police said the robbers were trying to get into a storage area 
where DRAMs are kept, but company spokesman Joel Don said AST isn't sure 
whether the robbers were after the computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 24, at least one armed robber bound and blindfolded an unarmed guard 
and, possibly with other bandits, stole $150,000 in specialized computer chips 
from W.G. Holt Inc., across the street from Advanced Logic. The chips look like 
DRAMs, but they were custom-made for Holt's customers in high-voltage and heart 
pacemaker businesses. "The value to the robbers is almost nothing," said 
Michael Garner, the firm's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Substantial Number' Stolen 
</P>
<P>
In September, at least one armed thug stole a "substantial number" of computer 
chips from a small computer business, said Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Richard 
Paddock. He refused to release any other details, including the company's name 
or the type and value of the chips. 
</P>
<P>
The four Irvine companies have taken additional security measures since the 
robberies, although executives will not discuss them. But the measures do not 
include arming security guards. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need a shoot-out at the OK Corral," said Advanced Logic's Kirkey. 
"Nothing is more valuable than a human life." 
</P>
<P>
The robberies apparently were carried out by separate groups, said Lt. White of 
Irvine. The only possible connection, he said, is between the Holt and AST 
robberies because witnesses in both cases said the bandits appeared to be 
Vietnamese.

Lazzareschi in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

Hawaii Meeting Off: With the government proposing to spend billions of dollars 
to bail out the savings and loan industry, the National Council of Savings 
Institutions will forgo holding its annual convention in Hawaii. Charles John 
Koch, a Cleveland savings bank executive and chairman of the council, said it 
would be inappropriate to hold the island meeting " when Congress and the 
Administration are working to find a solution to this terrible crisis facing 
taxpayers and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp". The group said it 
was making plans for a scaled-down meeting in Washington.

ORANGE COUNTY POPBEAT / MIKE BOEHM: GO-BETWEENS EXPLORE INTIMATE DIMENSIONS, 
SUBTLE SIDE OF ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock, for the most part, is a music of big sounds and big gestures, with the 
biggest payoffs going to those who can manipulate sound and image to create the 
biggest sensation. 
</P>
<P>
But there always has been a place in rock for performers whose preference is 
for reflection and self-restraint. Rather than pushing the outer limits of 
volume and stage exhibitionism, they choose a quieter, subtler middle way in 
trying to get across what they have to say. 
</P>
<P>
The Go-Betweens seem to have followed their name to a path of pop moderation. 
The Australian band, which plays Saturday at the Coach House and Sunday at 
Bogart's, pursues a method of delicacy and detail, gentleness and restraint. On 
their most recent album, "16 Lovers Lane," the Go-Betweens use a modest sound 
to craft a melodically winning, emotionally unfettered exploration of the most 
immoderate dimensions of human experience: love and romance. 
</P>
<P>
Guitar parts, most of them acoustic, ripple along like gently coursing streams. 
Violin and oboe flavorings place the band closer to the recital chamber's quiet 
than the rock arena's din. Robert Forster and Grant McLennan, the guitarists 
who founded the band 11 years ago and continue to write its songs, sing with 
wistfulness, melancholy or the intimacy of a lover's plea. They leave rock's 
swagger and grand display to others (the true greats, of course, have the 
ability to make memorable music in both ways: with boisterous sound and grand 
sweep as well as with intimate, crafted expression). 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by phone during a tour stop in San Francisco, Forster, 31, readily 
acknowledged the gulf between his band and the common image of rock music as a 
powerhouse source of big sound and big display. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're making big gestures in other areas," he said in a temperate 
voice that sounded apt for a Go-Between. "We're making big gestures in terms of 
songwriting. The softer, more concentrated poetic approach -- to me, that's a 
big gesture, and I'm very satisfied with it. Not to be a black-clad, big guitar 
rock band -- not to do that is a big gesture nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
Forster takes heart from the recent success of such performers as Suzanne Vega, 
Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked and 10,000 Maniacs, who have shown that there 
is an audience for rock that's moderate rather than blaring. So far in their 
seven-album career, the Go-Betweens' successes have been critical, rather than 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making melodic, quite commercial music, and there's just as good a 
chance of us being in the Top 40 as virtually anyone else," Forster said. "But 
I know what we are, and I'm aware that we are something of an acquired taste." 
</P>
<P>
In establishing that rock doesn't have to pack power chords and a big beat to 
succeed commercially, Vega, Chapman, Shocked and the rest have made their 
breakthroughs with socially and politically conscious songs. That's a resource 
that the Go-Betweens, to date, have lacked. But Forster thinks it would be a 
mistake for the band to stray from the love songs and character studies that 
have been its strong suit, for the sake of following a successful pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been satisfied with anything I've done in that area. It's not my 
natural voice," he said. "I don't want to be seen as doing it in a token way. I 
do have social concerns and I've written things in private. But it's not enough 
to feel it (if you) write it in a bad way." 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the Go-Betweens with romantic songwriting -- music's oldest 
profession. In most hands it's the most tired and hackneyed musical profession. 
But the Go-Betweens' strength lies in taking familiar forms, moods and ideas 
and clothing them with fresh melodic invention and lyrics that render 
often-expressed sentiments with imaginative images and narrative approaches. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to restrict themselves," Forster said. "I think there's a whole 
variety of subject matter and ideas that can be brought in that are willfully 
kept away from most love songs. People have this compulsion about (using 
cliches): 'Love is raging like a storm,' 'The first time I saw you, baby.' 
These sorts of phrases did have a power in about 1962. I don't see that now." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than restating platitudes about love, McLennan and Forster both have a 
knack for setting their tales in landscapes or city streets. Both avoid the 
usual subjects -- love's first joyful bloom, or its after-the-breakup anguish 
-- and focus on relationships in flux, where the potential for happiness or 
despair remains in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't matter how far you come, you've always got further to go," McLennan 
sings at one point. Forster, a less plain-spoken writer, garbs a similar notion 
of love as perpetual ebb and flow in more poetic imagery: "Wave after wave, our 
tension and our tenderness." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than always drawing from personal romantic experience, Forster says he 
tends to jot down conversations and stories he hears, or to take a love song he 
admires as a model and recast its basic emotional content in his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
Dwelling exclusively on personal experience, he says, would result either in 
lack of interesting material or emotional burnout. "Take Gerry Goffin and 
Carole King," said Forster, who admits to enjoying analyzing and weaving 
"outlandish theories" about other songwriters' work. "The amount of energy that 
was in their love songs -- if they came close to living the kinds of songs they 
wrote, they'd have been emotionally dead many years ago." Instead of true 
confessions, he said, the key is to use "a certain amount of invention and 
emotional heightening" to craft fictions that ring true. 
</P>
<P>
One of the virtues of "16 Lovers Lane" is a more pared-down, direct approach to 
lyrics and musical arrangements than on some earlier Go-Betweens albums. 
Forster said that, in trying to write more simply, he unconsciously began to 
focus repeatedly on such basic images as water, colors, and clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken a long time," he said, "and now I'm getting down to really simple, 
big things." 
</P>
<P>

AN UPDATED SHAKESPEARE IS MISMATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Purists may quibble, but there is nothing inherently wrong with updating 
Shakespeare's "As You Like It" and setting it in New York City during the Great 
Depression. At least that is what this reviewer thought before seeing the Art 
Deco staging at Rancho Santiago College's Phillips Hall Theatre, where it is 
playing through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Why not turn the Forest of Arden into Central Park? Because, as happens in this 
production, a guy on a park bench says: "Come, shall we go and kill us 
venison?" Why not turn Oliver's orchard into Oliver's swank supper club? 
Because the bartender says: "Yonder comes my master." Why not turn Duke 
Frederick's palace lawn into Le Boutique? Because one fashionable deb shopping 
for dresses says to another: "I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry." 
</P>
<P>
With a cast of thousands (OK, dozens), this production is a great big dolled-up 
eyeful. The lengthy first act -- which is all this reviewer stayed for -- has 
mobsters in snap-brim fedoras and floozies in fringes, swells in white tie and 
tails and overgrown kids in knickers, the unemployed masses marching for jobs 
("Hire Me! I'll Do Anything!" says one sign) and society ladies in cloche hats 
and fox stoles. It even has Madison Square Garden in lights. 
</P>
<P>
But what a great big fat earache it gives you. Except for Rick Franklin as Duke 
Frederick (doubling as Duke Senior), Brent Hardwick as Jaques ("All the world's 
a stage") and Curtis Rhodes as Amiens (singing and playing the ukulele), the 
largely student cast cannot handle Shakespeare's language. And, given the 
ludicrous incongruities of the staging, the actors sound even worse than they 
might have had the play been done straightforwardly. 
</P>
<P>
Had anyone bothered to make dramatic sense of the transposition from 
Elizabethan to Depression times, Shakespeare's comedy might have worked. (OK, 
barely.) But as it is, you can't help wondering why the director didn't just 
mount a screwball satire from the '30s. Everybody could have dressed to kill 
and made sense too. 
</P>
<P>

MOST VALLEY SCHOOLS PULL APPLES FROM MENU AFTER CANCER SCARE 
</P>

Most San Gabriel Valley students are not eating apples at school this week 
because food services directors said publicity about safety has caused them to 
yank the fruit from menus. 
</P>
<P>
"Publicity has really done apples in," said Marilyn Wells of the Alhambra City 
and High School Districts. "The children are saying, 'We are not supposed to 
eat apples because they are bad.' 
</P>
<P>
"There has been so much publicity that it is not feasible for us to serve them 
until we have further information from the state Department of Education," she 
said. The high school district serves Alhambra, San Gabriel and parts of 
Monterey Park and Rosemead. The district's elementary schools are in Alhambra 
and Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts no longer serving apples include Mountain View, Temple City, 
Arcadia, Azusa, Charter Oak (which serves Glendora and Covina), Covina-Valley, 
Duarte, Hacienda La Puente, Monrovia, Pomona, Rowland, South Pasadena, and West 
Covina unified school districts; the El Monte Union High School District, and 
the Garvey, Rosemead and San Gabriel school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Several districts, including Pasadena, Claremont and El Monte City, are still 
serving apples. Baldwin Park Unified School District officials plan to use the 
supply on hand and then stop offering them. San Marino school officials say 
they plan to resume offering apples soon. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about apples has grown in light of a national study that found children 
at an "intolerable risk" of cancer from pesticide residues on fruits and 
vegetables. The Washington-based National Resources Defense Council reported 
last month that the pesticide daminozide, which is sold under the brand name 
Alar, could increase the incidence of cancer in children. Applied chiefly to 
apples, it slows the ripening process and improves appearance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bans in L.A. and New York City 
</P>
<P>
The nation's two largest districts, Los Angeles Unified and New York City, have 
banned the use of apples. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley's largest school district, Hacienda La Puente Unified, 
served the last of its U.S. Department of Agriculture surplus apples on Tuesday 
because they had not been treated with Alar, said Peggy Reible. She said no 
more servings are scheduled this month. 
</P>
<P>
Reible and other food services directors hope that the state will be able to 
clarify the issue at a conference of the California School Food Service Assn., 
which begins in Oakland on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out that school menus are sent to every home so that parents 
know whether apples will be served. Most districts said they had received only 
a few inquiries from parents. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marino Unified School District stopped serving apples for three days 
but will put them back on the menu soon, said Robert Thompson, assistant 
superintendent for business. 
</P>
<P>
"We had withdrawn the product out of concern for the health of our students," 
he said. "But we have been assured by our suppliers that they do not use Alar." 
The Pasadena Unified School District is still serving apples after receiving 
letters from suppliers used by the district that the apples have not been 
treated with Alar, said Henrietta De'Ora. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always a choice of fruit so the children don't have to eat apples," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Park Unified School District is still serving USDA apples but will 
not purchase any more until notified by the state that there is no problem, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Claremont Unified School District has not yet made a decision, said Mary 
Polster, but will provide an alternative fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying not to panic but there has been so much media hype," she said. 
"Some of the little kids are saying, 'Apples are poisoned,' so the kids 
probably will bypass the apples." 
</P>
<P>
Apples are not on the menu this week in the Azusa Unified School District and 
spring vacation is next week so the situation is on hold, said Sandy Perrin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Apples on Menu 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a problem, and it has been blown out of proportion, but it becomes 
a problem when parents read these things," Perrin said. "So to be safe we are 
not serving them until we get word from the state." 
</P>
<P>
In the Arcadia Unified School District, some junior high school students have 
refused to take apples, said Debra Amos, who stopped serving them on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Unified School District officials got lucky when they discovered that 
there were no apples on the March menu. The district doesn't serve apple juice, 
and apple sauce is not scheduled until the last day in March. They hope by that 
time a decision won't be necessary, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Some districts that have dropped apples are continuing to serve apple juice and 
apple sauce because they have letters from their suppliers attesting that no 
Alar was used. 
</P>
<P>
The Bassett and Walnut Valley Unified school districts could not be reached for 
comment.

W. HOLLYWOOD TEMPORARILY CLOSES HOMELESS SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid reports of violence and drug-related problems, city officials have 
temporarily closed a nightly homeless shelter in West Hollywood, saying they 
intend to reorganize its operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Our thinking was that if we could close it down and bring in some new people 
(shelter workers) and provide some careful training for those people, it would 
be advantageous for everybody," City Manager Paul Brotzman said. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter in West Hollywood Park was closed abruptly last Friday after social 
workers complained to city officials that the situation there had deteriorated 
and that some shelter workers had expressed concern for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two people housed at the shelter were given vouchers for free 
accommodations at a Hollywood motel or a nearby YMCA until the shelter reopens 
March 27, Brotzman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was taken care of. We didn't leave anyone in the street," he said. 
"The idea is not to diminish our commitment to the homeless, but to improve 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Site 
</P>
<P>
The city has operated the temporary shelter from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily for up 
to 50 people at West Hollywood Park Auditorium. City officials had said they 
would operate the shelter until a $1.2-million permanent shelter, planned for a 
warehouse on the city's east side, is opened early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary shelter opened 10 months ago after the City Council approved a 
midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew in the city's parks, where dozens of homeless people 
were living. The council imposed rules prohibiting people under the influence 
of drugs or alcohol from being housed there. 
</P>
<P>
However, Brotzman said some shelter workers "had become lax in enforcing the 
rules, sending mixed signals to some people" being housed at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Others say shelter workers often bent the rules to help people with nowhere 
else to go, and at times were intimidated by people who threatened to harm them 
unless they were allowed to enter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff of Four 
</P>
<P>
The shelter has been staffed by two social workers under contract to the city 
along with two unarmed security guards, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at the shelter have been caught in the middle," said Sam Weinstein, 
an advocate for the homeless. "You can't place the blame on the staff that 
things have gotten out of control. They've done the best they could under some 
difficult circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Others say threats and actual violence involving shelter patrons have increased 
since the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department three weeks ago began to more 
strictly enforce the park curfew. City officials had complained that drug 
dealing and alcohol abuse in West Hollywood Park and Plummer Park were out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"Before (the crackdown), it was a question of if you didn't get into the 
shelter, there was the possibility of being arrested (for violating the 
curfew)," social worker Sue Wilcox said. "Now, that's become a probability. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of desperation (among the homeless) that hasn't been there in 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16 Arrests 
</P>
<P>
In the first two weeks of the crackdown, sheriff's deputies arrested 16 people 
in the two parks, most of them for curfew violations and drug- and 
alcohol-related offenses, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, deputies made 11 more arrests. Eight of those were in West Hollywood 
Park and included five curfew violations there, said Capt. Rachel Burgess, who 
supervises the West Hollywood sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were arrested at the shelter shortly after midnight March 1 when a 
fight inside spilled onto a patio, and several homeless people who were not 
being housed at the shelter became involved, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Two nights later, deputies were called to the auditorium during a meeting of 
the Planning Commission. Several homeless people, who had assembled under an 
outdoor patio to escape the rain, had become rowdy, a city employee said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was arrested, and the group dispersed when deputies arrived, according 
to the employee, who did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Tension 
</P>
<P>
While city officials cite such incidents as evidence of increased tension among 
the homeless in West Hollywood Park, Weinstein and other homeless advocates say 
that other problems have also contributed to the restlessness. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, Weinstein said, "promised for many months to provide cots so 
people wouldn't be forced to sleep on the floor, and it wasn't until two months 
ago that they got them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the cots are available, there's still no system for storing them so 
that a person is guaranteed of using the same cot he had the night before. 
That's not a tenable situation." 
</P>
<P>
With the shelter temporarily closed, the number of homeless people encamped in 
West Hollywood Park during the daytime has decreased dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems strange looking around out here and seeing non-homeless people 
outnumbering the homeless," said a park user who did not want to be identified. 
"I mean, you look up suddenly and they're gone."

COUNCIL-ELECT WILL MEET PRIVATELY UNTIL SWEARING IN 
</P>

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newly elected City Council says it will hold closed meetings until its 
members take the oath of office, because county officials have advised them 
that they are not legally required to meet publicly until then. 
</P>
<P>
But at a meeting Monday night, the council-elect decided it will publicly 
announce major decisions reached at future private meetings, said 
Councilman-elect Gary Werner. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we're hiding from anybody," Councilman-elect John Forbing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar residents approved cityhood by a 76.2%-23.8% margin on March 7 and 
selected a five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, the five had held three meetings since the election. Two were 
open to the public and one was attended by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum has directed his staff not to meet 
with the Diamond Bar council-elect in private. 
</P>
<P>
"Any meeting with the Diamond Bar City Council that involves county personnel 
has to be open to the press and public or else we will not be involved," said 
Judy Hammond, a spokeswoman for Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
She said Schabarum issued the directive because meetings between the 
council-elect and the county pertain to public matters, such as the transition 
of power and possible service contracts with the county. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor's order only applies to meetings involving county employees, 
Hammond said. Schabarum has no control over meetings between council 
members-elect, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we are going to have some meetings that are closed," said Phyllis Papen, 
the top vote-getter among 20 council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"We are acting under the county counsel's advice," said Papen. "We went to (the 
counsel) prior to the meetings to see what the regulations were." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exempt From Brown Act 
</P>
<P>
According to Gerald Crump, chief assistant county counsel, pre-incorporation 
meetings do not fall under the state's open meetings law, known as the Brown 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not the city council until such time as the council is formed," Crump 
said. "So, we've always felt that up until that time the Brown Act doesn't 
apply." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Benell, executive officer of the Local Agencies Formation Commission, an 
independent state agency, said that on Election Night, she gave the Diamond Bar 
council-elect the same advice. She said she told them that they will function 
as private citizens until they are sworn in at the first official council 
meeting, tentatively scheduled for mid- to late April. 
</P>
<P>
A city must incorporate within one year after voters approve cityhood. Most 
cities formed between 1981 and 1984, such as West Hollywood, Agoura Hills, and 
Westlake Village, took four to six weeks to complete the process of 
incorporation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Official Yet 
</P>
<P>
Between the election and formal incorporation, the council-elect has no public 
money to spend because the council does not officially exist. But the council 
can make interim decisions that have potential financial consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Before incorporation becomes official, councils-elect usually select an interim 
city manager and city attorney and work with county officials on the transition 
of power, said David Estrada, city-county liaison for the county's chief 
administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
The Brown Act has "never become an issue in any of the other incorporations" in 
the county, said Benell, who has assisted with 15 to 20 city incorporations. 
Diamond Bar is the 86th city in Los Angeles County to be incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
The open-meetings issue is "being blown out of proportion," said 
Councilman-elect Forbing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Frankness 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we chose to have the first meeting in private is because we felt 
the need to work out some relationships and decide where we're going," Forbing 
said. He said members needed to speak frankly. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the election four of the five met, but only to get acquainted and 
to discuss election results, Papen said. 
</P>
<P>
At a second meeting last Thursday, the five discussed arrangements for the 
city's official incorporation. At that meeting, the council-elect allowed a 
reporter from the San Gabriel Valley Tribune to sit in, but the reporter agreed 
to step out while members selected Papen as mayor and Paul Horcher, 
second-place finisher in the council race, as mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not official acts," Benell said. "They can change that (decision) 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Forbing said Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) publicly announced the mayor 
and mayor pro tem selections at the Miss Diamond Bar pageant last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The council-elect also held a closed meeting to interview candidates for an 
interim city manager's position.

CRITICS PROMPT OVERHAUL OF BELEAGUERED ALCOHOL SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few of the 6,000 Ventura County residents who are sent every year to Alcohol 
Information School want to be there. Most believe it was simply bad luck, not 
booze, that got them convicted of drunk driving in the first place. All grumble 
about having to pay as much as $875 for the honor of attending. 
</P>
<P>
Even under the best of circumstances, the county program can be an 
administrative headache, with many staff members themselves recovering from 
alcoholism and with about 40% of their students being rearrested within seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But the task is made all the more difficult by bickering and mismanagement. In 
a Ventura County Grand Jury report issued two weeks ago, the school was 
criticized for its lack of leadership, constant infighting, poor morale, 
unprofessional counseling and the "decline in overall . . . effectiveness" of 
its alcohol classes. 
</P>
<P>
And the county Corrections Services Agency and some Municipal Court judges have 
complained that the school has not kept close enough tabs on its students, who 
are required by state law to attend weekly sessions for periods ranging from 
five weeks to one year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spotty Attendance 
</P>
<P>
Last month, prodded to clean up its records, the school found that more than 
1,000 students -- about one-third of the total enrollment at the time -- 
attended classes so spottily that their cases had to be referred to probation 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in pretty bad shape," said Rudy Aguilar, co-director of the school. 
"You could feel the tension." 
</P>
<P>
To help remedy those woes, school administrators said, new managers are being 
brought in, better truancy reports are being filed and a step-by-step manual 
outlining job descriptions and procedures is being drafted. A formal response 
to the grand jury's report is in the works, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, we operate one of the best schools in the state," said Terry 
Dryer, a senior administrative analyst who was brought in to help clear up the 
mess. "We just had a glitch for a little while." 
</P>
<P>
While school officials said they have already made some improvements, their 
dilemma still reflects the uphill battle that even the best-managed of the 
state's 56 alcohol programs must confront: How do you run a school designed for 
people who don't want to attend? 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no definitive measure of how successful these programs are," 
said Mike Wood, executive director of the California Assn. of Drinking Driver 
Treatment Programs. "There are some success stories . . . but it's not easy 
because you're dealing with people who see it as just another part of the 
sentence. For them, it's like jail time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Effectiveness 
</P>
<P>
Studies in California and nationwide indicate that mandatory alcohol programs 
are generally more effective than doing nothing. But evidence is often 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
A 1981 report by the Orange County Alcohol Program found that participants in a 
yearlong alcohol class were rearrested for drunk driving about half as much as 
people who failed to complete the program. But a report the same year by the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that such programs had 
little effect in modifying behavior, especially for problem drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of a Ventura County study indicate that the Alcohol 
Information School has helped reduce the number of people who are rearrested 
for drunk driving, although a sizable percentage of former students continue to 
commit the same offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Of 4,200 first-time offenders convicted during 1980 and 1981, 64% had not been 
arrested for driving under the influence seven years later. Alcohol school 
graduates avoided arrest in 66% of the cases, as opposed to 53% of 
non-graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Of 1,200 repeat offenders convicted during the same years, 56% had not been 
rearrested seven years later. Graduates of the school fared better than 
dropouts, 62% to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to get tremendous results, but I think we have to mark our 
progress in small percentages," said Bill Weinerth, a special projects 
coordinator for the school who is working on the study. "We're dealing with a 
very recalcitrant population that by and large doesn't feel it has a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Others are less hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't get the drunks off the highways," said Ken Sears, who retired last 
year as administrator of the county's Alcohol Programs agency. "It still 
doesn't solve the basic problem." 
</P>
<P>
The $1.3-million program, which is funded entirely by tuition, employs 24 
people who teach a total of 60 classes at any given time. Most classes are 
supplemented by group and individual counseling sessions. Repeat offenders are 
required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and a monthly workshop with 
victims of drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening at the school on Telephone Road in Ventura, a dozen 
students, ranging in age from early 20s to late 50s, gathered in a small 
classroom for a 2 1/2-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
For the first hour, they listened to a tape-recording made by a psychiatrist 
with a dry wit and a Texas accent who talked about the dangers of alcohol 
abuse, as well as cocaine, marijuana, tranquilizers and PCP. 
</P>
<P>
They learned that 250,000 deaths are attributed to alcohol every year, that 
cocaine travels at 120 m.p.h. when it is snorted up the nose and that marijuana 
can linger in the body's fatty tissues for up to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
In a discussion group, the students evaluated the tape, which one called "very 
informative" and another termed "incredibly boring." 
</P>
<P>
Then they talked about their own drinking problems. One man explained how he 
went from guzzling beer for breakfast to total sobriety; a woman told how she 
has moved from hard liquor to wine coolers. 
</P>
<P>
Outside after class, one woman, a 30-year-old bank teller from Ventura, said 
she was a rebel who found it hard to swallow such information under duress. 
</P>
<P>
But a 21-year-old carpet layer from Piru said the classes sometimes have led 
him to reflect seriously on his drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's boring and a pain," he said, "but it's not as bad as I thought it would 
be."

2 FRESHMEN LEGISLATORS VOTE AGAINST GUN CONTROL 
</P>

<P>
In one of their first major actions on the Assembly floor, freshman legislators 
Willard H. Murray and Bob Epple this week broke ranks with most of their 
Democratic colleagues and voted against a controversial bill that would outlaw 
certain assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
After an emotional three-hour debate, the Assembly on Monday narrowly approved 
the measure by a 41-38 vote and sent it to the Senate. Only eight of the 
Assembly's 47 Democrats opposed the bill, including Murray of Paramount, Epple 
of Norwalk and Dave Elder of San Pedro, who also represents part of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) would outlaw about 40 specific firearms 
listed as "assault" weapons, including the Israeli-made Uzi and the AK-47, used 
by the military in many Communist countries. In pressing his case during the 
debate, Roos described his proposal as the first step in "bringing some sort of 
sanity and civilization back into our communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Reduce Crime 
</P>
<P>
Murray said that the floor debate failed to change his mind and predicted that 
the Roos legislation "will not reduce crime because it will not reduce the 
availability of guns" for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Murray said, if the bill becomes law "it will give people a false 
sense of security" that gang violence has been curbed. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate last week approved a stronger bill to control assault weapons, which 
now must be reconciled with the Assembly version. Gov. George Deukmejian has 
indicated he favors the Assembly's approach. 
</P>
<P>
Murray has made no secret of his opposition to further gun controls, a position 
that has drawn criticism from city officials in Compton, which is in his 
district. In January the Compton City Council passed an ordinance banning the 
possession and sale of AK-47s and other assault-type weapons in the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endorsed by NRA 
</P>
<P>
In his election victory last November, Murray was endorsed by the National 
Rifle Assn., which opposed the Roos bill. 
</P>
<P>
But Murray said the NRA did not lobby him to oppose the bill. "I arrived at the 
conclusion all by myself," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Epple, who rents a room in Roos' Sacramento condominium, declined several 
requests for comment on his opposition to his roommate's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that Epple disagrees with his bill, Roos quipped: "It shows that 
we're the definite odd couple." 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote Elder handed out a three-page statement to explain his 
opposition. He echoed Murray's view that the bill would have no impact on crime 
"because gangs would obtain weapons illegally anyway." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supported Waiting Period 
</P>
<P>
Elder's statement suggested that instead of a ban, Roos might get more support 
for legislation to require a 15-day waiting period before a person could 
purchase an assault weapon. He also said he supports provisions in Roos' bill 
to increase penalties for unlawful use of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The other Democrats representing Southeast Los Angeles County -- Charles 
Calderon of Whittier, Theresa P. Hughes of Los Angeles, Lucille Roybal Allard 
of Los Angeles and Maxine Waters of Los Angeles -- supported the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans Dennis Brown of Los Alamitos, who represents part of Long Beach, 
and Frank Hill of Whittier were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill, passed last week, bans Uzis, AK-47s and other military combat 
weapons in California. Among its supporters were Democrats Ralph C. Dills of 
Gardena, Cecil Green of Norwalk and Joseph B. Montoya of Whittier and 
Republican Robert G. Beverly of Manhattan Beach.

TRUSTEE'S FOES SUBMIT SIGNATURES FOR RECALL VOTE 
</P>

<P>
Organizers of a recall effort aimed at Oxnard School District trustee Jack 
Fowler said they had collected enough signatures by Tuesday's deadline to force 
an election. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which includes parents and teachers, has given Ventura County 
election officials petitions bearing 8,400 to 9,000 signatures, at least 1,000 
more than required to force a recall election, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything holds, we've got him," said Mark Prim, a junior high school 
teacher and an official in the Oxnard Educators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers union, which represents the district's 486 teachers, spearheaded 
the recall after becoming deadlocked with the district in contract negotiations 
late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Union members characterized Fowler, who has been on the board for 15 years, as 
a domineering and insensitive trustee who manipulates the board. 
</P>
<P>
They hoped to advance their cause in December by revealing that Fowler, who 
oversees the district's finances, had filed for personal bankruptcy earlier in 
the year to relieve $126,000 in debts. They said it showed that he was 
financially irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
The recall effort got a big boost two weeks ago when Fowler supported an 
unpopular plan to dismantle court-ordered busing in the district and gradually 
return its students to neighborhood schools. The board voted 3 to 2 to end the 
busing. The recall campaign grew quickly thereafter, with 4,000 signatures 
gathered last weekend alone. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler complained Wednesday that organizers capitalized unfairly on the vote. 
</P>

"Rather than debate the integration issue on its merits, they made an emotional 
issue of it and whipped it into a hysterical thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
County election officials were working Wednesday to confirm that the petitions 
contained at least 7,322 signatures, the minimum required to force a recall 
election, said Ruth Schelper, assistant registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
If that minimum is reached, election officials will begin the laborious task of 
checking to determine whether each signature belongs to a registered voter 
living within the Oxnard School District, a 15-school elementary-level district 
that includes most of Oxnard and some parts of Port Hueneme.

CRITICISMS CHANGE HAPPY HOUR'S FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The perception of happy hour as a time for the rapid guzzling of discounted 
cocktails has dogged the restaurant industry, particularly in recent years when 
increased emphasis has been placed on liability for drunken driving. Happy hour 
promotions, such as two-for-one deals or discounts on particular drinks, have 
been denounced by such groups as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), who 
maintain that such practices encourage excessive drinking. 
</P>
<P>
However, a restaurant industry spokesman said restaurants and hotels are 
relying less on such gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a move away from price-oriented happy hours," said Stan Kyker, 
the executive vice president of the California Restaurant Assn. "Now 
food-oriented happy hours are the more typical approach. Instead of offering 
discounted drinks, restaurants are saying, 'Come in between 4 and 6 and enjoy 
our happy hour buffet.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kyker said the gradual change has not come about because of pressure from any 
governmental or legislative group, but is seen as "a way to increase traffic. 
That's what happy hour is intended to do. It's not intended to increase the 
consumption of alcohol by individuals. It's intended to bring more people into 
the establishment and build a social atmosphere where people can talk and 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
There are no laws governing happy hour practices in California, and the last 
time such legislation was proposed, in 1985, it was defeated in committee. The 
bill, sponsored by state Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale), would have banned 
two-for-one drink offers, all-you-can-drink promotions, drinking contests with 
liquor prizes going to the winners, free drinks and other enticements. 
</P>
<P>
Such a law would not be unique in the United States. At least 14 other states, 
including Massachusetts, Ohio and Michigan, have either banned or tightened 
regulation of happy hours. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to win committee approval, Russell amended the bill to remove a 
misdemeanor penalty for a first-offense violation and opted instead to let the 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control establish penalties by regulation. 
</P>
<P>
After a yearlong study, Kyker said, the ABC issued a report "stating that they 
did not believe that they had the authority to impose anything on their own, 
and they recommended no changes." 
</P>
<P>
Which, said Kay Lentz, administrative assistant to Russell, effectively put the 
lid on any anti-happy hour legislation, at least in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"After the department issued its report," she said, "it was decided that we 
weren't going to be able to pursue it. There was no support in the 
administration or the Legislature for it. We don't have anything in the works 
now." PATRICK MOTT

AFTER FAILING TO HALT CONDO, LAWYER FIGHTS FOR PLACE IN SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica attorney David Ganezer said he may be down, but he isn't out. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year and a half, Ganezer, 28, has fought to prevent the 
construction of a three-story, four-unit condominium project that he says will 
block the sunlight and oceanic view of an apartment complex owned by his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the Planning Commission to scale down the project, and he failed. 
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the City Council and then the state Coastal Commission, but 
failed both times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Felt Whipped' 
</P>
<P>
He asked a state Superior Court judge for a temporary restraining order to stop 
construction of the condominium complex, alleging that some council members 
violated the Brown Act by approving the project after a private meeting with 
its developers. 
</P>
<P>
Again, he lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt whipped, and defeated," said Ganezer, as he watched the sun plunge into 
the Pacific Ocean from the top balcony of his father's five-story, 17-unit 
apartment complex at 3rd and Hollister streets. "I knew the developers did not 
care about this neighborhood. All they want is money. Then, I got an idea. What 
if I gave them a dose of their own medicine?" 
</P>
<P>
In what may be his final stand against the condominium project, Ganezer is 
about to acquire the plot of land west of the proposed project. He has begun 
plans to build an 18- by 30-foot house on the land, which would block the 
sunlight and oceanic view of the proposed condominium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bid on Land 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to build a 'mongo' house," he said. "It's going to be the size of 
Tibet." 
</P>
<P>
Ganezer's eldest brother bid on the land, and escrow was expected to close 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
To help design his house, the attorney has also garnered the help of a former 
foe. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Herb Katz, who voted to approve the condominium project and 
defeated Ganezer in last November's elections, said he would be delighted to 
design the house. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said that when he received Ganezer's call, "I was taken aback. I mean we 
are certainly strange bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I am an architect first, and a city councilman second. It would 
be a neat challenge to design a house like that." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Katz said that if a debate on the proposed structure goes before the 
City Council, he would abstain from voting but would not surrender the project. 
</P>
<P>
It may come to that, said Kevin Herst, one of the developers of the proposed 
condominium project. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were any other developer who wanted to build that house, I'd support 
them as long as the project met building codes," he said. "But I know that 
Ganezer's motive is pure hostility. He sees an opportunity to get even, and I 
would fight that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ganezer said, "I'm not out for retaliation. I want to make money, just 
like they do." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said he has become obsessed with stopping the construction of the 
condominium complex because its developers "never showed any concern for the 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Between 25 and 30 people live in his father's complex of 17, one-bedroom 
apartments. Many are low-income tenants who have lived there more than a 
decade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked them time and time again to compromise and build a two-story project, 
but they refused because all they care about is profits," he said. "Well, now 
the shoe is on the other foot. Let's see how they feel."

DEUKMEJIAN NAMES ZELTNER TO ADVISORY JOB

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Assemblyman Paul E. Zeltner (R-Lakewood) has been named an adviser to 
Gov. George Deukmejian on law enforcement issues and legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Zeltner, 63, will be paid $64,404 a year as the law enforcement and public 
safety liaison for the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Since he lost his 54th Assembly District seat last November, Zeltner, a former 
Los Angeles County sheriff's captain, has been seeking an appointment from 
Deukmejian, a political ally. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann, the governor's assistant press secretary, said on Tuesday that 
Zeltner will serve as Deukmejian's "eyes and ears" in dealing with various law 
enforcement agencies statewide. Beermann said Zeltner will help the Deukmejian 
Administration establish policy on law enforcement issues and anti-crime 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Zeltner served in the Sheriff's Department between 1947 and 1974. He was 
elected in 1977 to the Lakewood City Council and served until 1986, when he won 
his Assembly seat. In the Assembly election, Zeltner defeated Democrat Edward 
K. Waters in the heavily Democratic 54th District. But last fall, Zeltner lost 
his reelection bid to Willard H. Murray (D-Paramount).

8 TEACHERS MAY BE LAID OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Education agreed to notify eight probationary teachers that they 
may not be re-employed for the 1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers, five from the high school and three from the middle schools, are 
on probationary status because they have been teaching in the district less 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state education code, the district must notify teachers by March 15 
that they may be laid off during the next school year. The district will make a 
final decision on the layoffs after it is more certain about its budget.

SNAPSHOTS: SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GIFTED STUDENTS MIX IN A DUARTE CLASS -- AND 
BOTH LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Morris wasn't impressed when her fifth-grade son started tinkering with a 
watch, then proceeded to take a camera apart. 
</P>
<P>
But her interest was piqued when she discovered the boy was dissecting devices 
to understand how they work as part of his gifted and talented education (GATE) 
class at Valley View Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who teaches special education at the same Duarte school, had an idea. 
</P>
<P>
She thought her students, who have learning handicaps such as dyslexia or an 
impaired ability to concentrate, might benefit from rubbing shoulders with GATE 
students. 
</P>
<P>
She approached GATE teacher Lloyd Martinez and by January, her eight 
fifth-grade students were constructing model airplanes out of balsa wood next 
to their GATE counterparts. The joint class on planes and aviation history 
culminated in a recent excursion to the El Monte Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Combining classes on different levels was like walking on thin ice," Martinez 
said of the six weeks he taught with Morris. "You don't know what's going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said her main concern was that Martinez's class not feel used. "We were 
careful not to change the program for the GATE kids," she noted. "There was the 
same high level of expectation." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the match was ideal because of the small number of GATE students, 
24, and the greater freedom that class has in deciding how students want to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
"In regular classrooms they don't take the time very often to do non-academic 
projects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
GATE students served as role models for her pupils by being attentive and 
focusing on their own work, she said. The once-a-week visits to the GATE 
classroom also gave her students a chance to socialize with mainstream 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's deadening to group children by ability. They become stifled," she said. 
In the mixed class, her students were stimulated by their GATE counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"We identify with who we're around, so we should be around the best quality 
people" to perform best, Morris said. "There's nothing that teaches faster than 
a model." 
</P>
<P>
Kiwan Sims, a 10-year-old with a short attention span who has difficulty 
processing what he sees, was "in seventh heaven" in the combined class, Morris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sims said he didn't think he could make a plane at first but he did. "It was 
harder but I still liked it," he said, adding that constructing the wings was 
the hardest part. 
</P>
<P>
While Sims usually can concentrate on an activity for a maximum of five minutes 
before losing interest, he worked intently for two hours at a stretch with the 
GATE students, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
When he gets restless, "if he (starts bothering) one of my other kids we would 
have a fight," she said. "But a model child with the skill of paying attention 
doesn't engage him and calms him down." 
</P>
<P>
She said the model-building assignment also boosted her students' self-esteem. 
"There's less pressure here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some GATE children altered their views of the special education students after 
working with them. 
</P>
<P>
"One kid was constantly asking for help," recalled Greg Hagopian, 10. "But he 
built a better plane than I did. I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Duffin, 10, had thought the special education class was for students with 
problems. But she said she did not notice any special problems, except that her 
once-a-week classmates were a bit slower. "It's kind of hard having to teach 
them all the time," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult working with people that can't keep up with you," agreed Starr 
Pebley, 10. But "I learned that even if people are in special classes, they're 
still human beings. You can talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
Other GATE students had not even realized that their visitors were from a 
special class. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment was so successful, the two classes hope to build a pump to learn 
how the heart works. 
</P>
<P>
Alberta Schroder, coordinator of the district's elementary-level GATE program, 
said she would consider making the collaboration a permanent feature while 
planning next year's curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that very bright people learn to communicate with others to 
understand that everybody is special," she said.

HEARINGS ON LAND REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Education has scheduled five public hearings on the district's 
controversial real estate committee report, which includes a proposal to tear 
down the historic Beverly Hills High School and replace it with a Century 
City-styled high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-page report explores ways to use the school's surplus and under-utilized 
properties to improve school finances. 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings will begin at 7:30 p.m. at: 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills High School, 241 Moreno Drive, April 10. 
</P>
<P>
El Rodeo School, 605 Whittier Drive, April 18. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Vista School, 200 S. Elm Drive, April 26. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Mann School, 8701 Charleville Blvd., May 4. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne School, 624 Rexford Drive, May 10. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal to redevelop the site, the district would raze the school 
and construct a high school on the northern 19 acres. It would lease the 
remaining eight acres at Olympic Boulevard and Spalding Drive to a developer to 
build an office complex. Depending on the size of the development, the district 
could earn as much as $18 million a year from the development. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's other recommendations include proposals to develop the 
district's headquarters on Lasky and Moreno drives; a high school parking lot 
next to Jimmy's Restaurant, and another parking lot on Elm Drive across the 
street from Beverly Vista Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also suggested that the district consider leasing a portion of 
the Horace Mann School playground on Robertson Boulevard to a developer for the 
construction of retail stores. "The portion of Horace Mann playground that 
would be used for development could be replaced by a rooftop playing field on 
top of the retail structures," the report said.

COUNCIL ENDORSES ARMS BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has endorsed unanimously a resolution calling for the state 
Legislature to ban the sale of semiautomatic assault rifles. Before the council 
voted Monday, several speakers voiced their concern that such a ban would only 
ensure that law-abiding citizens would be prohibited from using the weapons in 
sporting activities or collections. 
</P>
<P>
But the resolution noted that "urban assault weapons, such as the AK-47 and 
Uzi, are military-type, high-powered arms which are inherently not suitable for 
home protection or hunting." The resolution, referring to the use of the 
weapons by cocaine dealers and violent gang members, said "there is no shelter 
nor escape for innocent bystanders caught in the cross fire of urban assault 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
As an amendment to the resolution, Mayor Barry L. Hatch gained support from the 
council to urge the Legislature to adopt a mandatory, additional 10-year prison 
sentence for those convicted of crimes in which the weapons are used.

In 1988, 69 deaths in Orange County were attributed to heroin. Ages of the 
victims ranged from 19 to 63, with 84% being males. Of the total deaths, 51% 
had been drinking and 53% had used heroin in combination with cocaine, a 
process known as "speed-balling." Here's the trend in heroin deaths since 1973.

MARINA RATE HIKES SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors is proposing rate 
increases for several Marina del Rey facilities that would produce an 
additional $51,400 in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals, endorsed by the county Small Craft Harbor Commission, are the 
result of an annual review of rates designed to assure that the fees are 
competitive with other marinas, according to Stan Wisniewski, the department's 
deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals are expected to go before the County Board of Supervisors within 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The department is proposing increasing summer parking rates at four county lots 
from $4 to $5; metered parking rates at Burton Chace Park and north jetty view 
piers from 25 cents an hour to 50 cents an hour; dinghy storage from $72 to $96 
a year; mast-up dry storage from $2.75 per foot to $3.25 per foot a month; and 
transient boat docks from 40 cents per foot a day in winter to a year-round 
rate of 50 cents per foot a day, the current summer rate.

TEACHERS ASK FOR 12% RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teachers union on Tuesday submitted its initial contract proposal for the 
1989-90 school year, requesting a 12% salary increase to become effective July 
1. The proposal also requests full family medical and dental coverage starting 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Full-time teachers asked that contact with students, including supervision, be 
limited to 20.8 hours per week, and that no teacher be required to teach a 
class beginning before 8 a.m. or extending after 3:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Unified School District will submit its first proposal in two 
to four weeks, said Walther R. Puffer, assistant superintendent for 
personnel/pupil services. Bargaining between the Beverly Hills Education Assn., 
the teachers union, and the district will begin two weeks after that, he said.

GUN DEALER TO FACE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles gun dealer accused of the illegal sale of semiautomatic assault 
rifles will face trial in Pasadena Municipal Court May 1 after pleading 
innocent to the charges this week. 
</P>
<P>
The dealer, Ology Gibson, is accused of failing to obtain a Pasadena business 
license and a permit for an outdoor sale before selling assault rifles in the 
parking lot of a Pasadena gun store last month. 
</P>
<P>
He also is charged with three misdemeanor violations of the state Dangerous 
Weapons Control Act, including failure to observe a 15-day waiting period for 
concealed weapons. The city prosecutor's office contends that assault rifles 
are small enough to be concealed and therefore should require the same kind of 
waiting period imposed on handguns.

NEIGHBORS RALLY FOR LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of residents living near tiny Sunnyslope Library on Rosemead Boulevard 
have organized to fight to keep a library in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The county has had a library in the Sunnyslope area for more than 75 years, but 
the current one-room facility may be demolished soon to make way for a 
mini-mall proposed by Arcadia developer Ron Rossiter. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Knicker, a leader of the residents' group, said they don't oppose the 
plan, but want a guarantee from the county that the Sunnyslope Library will be 
relocated. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Crismond, the county's chief librarian, said no decision has been made on 
the whether the library would be moved or closed.

GIFTED, SPECIAL-EDUCATION STUDENTS LEARN TOGETHER; 
</P>
<P>
MIXING IT UP IN A MODEL CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Morris wasn't impressed when her fifth-grade son started tinkering with a 
watch, then proceeded to take a camera apart. 
</P>
<P>
But her interest was piqued when she discovered that the boy was dissecting 
devices to understand how they work as part of his gifted and talented 
education (GATE) class at Valley View Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who teaches special education at the same Duarte school, had an idea. 
</P>
<P>
She thought her students, who have learning handicaps such as dyslexia or an 
impaired ability to concentrate, might benefit from rubbing shoulders with GATE 
students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trip to Airport 
</P>
<P>
She approached GATE teacher Lloyd Martinez and by January, her eight 
fifth-grade students were constructing model airplanes out of balsa wood next 
to their GATE counterparts. The joint class on planes and aviation history 
culminated in a recent excursion to the El Monte Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Combining classes on different levels was like walking on thin ice," Martinez 
said of the 6 weeks he taught with Morris. "You don't know what's going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said her main concern was that Martinez's class not feel used. "We were 
careful not to change the program for the GATE kids," she noted. "There was the 
same high level of expectation." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the match was ideal because of the small number of GATE students, 
24, and the greater freedom that class has in deciding how students want to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
"In regular classrooms they don't take the time very often to do non-academic 
projects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
GATE students served as role models for her pupils by being attentive and 
focusing on their own work, she said. The once-a-week visits to the GATE 
classroom also gave her students a chance to socialize with mainstream 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's deadening to group children by ability. They become stifled," she said. 
In the mixed class, her students were stimulated by their GATE counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role Models Teach 
</P>
<P>
"We identify with who we're around, so we should be around the best-quality 
people" to perform best, Morris said. "There's nothing that teaches faster than 
a model." 
</P>
<P>
Kiwan Sims, a 10-year-old with a short attention span who has difficulty 
processing what he sees, was "in seventh heaven" in the combined class, Morris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kiwan said he didn't think he could make a plane at first, but he did. "It was 
harder, but I still liked it," he said, adding that constructing the wings was 
the hardest part. 
</P>
<P>
While Kiwan usually can concentrate on an activity for a maximum of 5 minutes 
before losing interest, he worked intently for 2 hours at a stretch with the 
GATE students, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the model-building assignment also boosted her students' self-esteem. 
"There's less pressure here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some GATE children altered their views of the special education students after 
working with them. 
</P>
<P>
"One kid was constantly asking for help," recalled Greg Hagopian, 10. "But he 
built a better plane than I did. I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Duffin, 10, had thought the special education class was for students with 
problems. But she said she did not notice any special problems, except that her 
once-a-week classmates were a bit slower. "It's kind of hard having to teach 
them all the time," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult working with people that can't keep up with you," agreed Starr 
Pebley, 10. But "I learned that even if people are in special classes, they're 
still human beings. You can talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
Other GATE students had not even realized that their visitors were from a 
special class. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment was so successful that the two classes hope to build a pump to 
learn how the heart works. 
</P>
<P>
Alberta Schroder, coordinator of the district's elementary-level GATE program, 
said she would consider making the collaboration a permanent feature in 
planning next year's curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that very bright people learn to communicate with others to 
understand that everybody is special," she said.

SUPPORTERS TOAST THE WORK OF VOLUNTEER CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MARIN, Pamela Marin a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shiny white car pulled into the Westin South Coast Plaza parking lot on 
Thursday sporting license plates that read: IM4WINE. 
</P>
<P>
The driver -- and about 400 others for wine -- was on her way to a fund-raiser 
for the Volunteer Center of Orange County-Central/South, a $35-per-person 
ticket to gustatory bliss. 
</P>
<P>
"A Toast From the Heart," the group's fifth annual food and wine fest, featured 
buffets loaded with goodies from eight of the county's top restaurants, 
complemented by wines of all colors and descriptions (including the memorable 
"peppery," "herbaceous" and "in the fruity mode") from 20 California wineries. 
</P>
<P>
The dressed-for-business crowd arrived promptly at 6:30 p.m., to pick and 
choose among such dinner fare as greens topped with charred-rare ahi tuna from 
Bistango; sushi and Bermuda fish chowder from J.W.'s Sea Grill; roast duck from 
the Hobbit, and fettuccine Alfredo from Alfredo's Ristorante &amp; Taverna -- 
the top draw, judging by a 20-plus line wrapped around Alfredo's circular 
buffet. 
</P>
<P>
The party, which concluded with an auction of 61 lots of wine, raised an 
estimated $30,000, according to event chairman Eugene Anderson, who mingled and 
sipped fume blanc with Jill Klockner at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the turnout pleased him, especially considering how hard it is 
"to raise money for a behind-the-scenes organization like ours." 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteer Center, of which Central/South is the largest of the county's 
three chapters, works with the estimated 700 local nonprofit organizations by 
promoting volunteerism and recruiting volunteers; leading training seminars in 
all areas of nonprofit management; providing technical assistance, and donating 
money and other resources. 
</P>
<P>
Executive director Carol Stone characterized the group as "the Kelly Girls of 
the nonprofit sector," and talked about how volunteerism has changed in the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Lady Bountiful of the '70s is gone," Stone said. "The new volunteer is a very 
savvy person with limited time, who wants that time to be used in a satisfying 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"The volunteer has changed, so we've had to change our way of thinking. When we 
do training with nonprofits, we encourage them to have envelope-stuffing-type 
jobs done by staffers so the more satisfying parts of the work can be turned 
over to volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
Stone said the Volunteer Center placed an estimated 15,000 volunteers last year 
-- nearly half of whom were men. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Mary Watson-Bruce, an administrator of gerontology programs at 
UC Irvine, said her 8-year involvement with the Volunteer Center is a natural. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of those who grew up with a sense of responsibility to the community," 
she said, munching pasta and talking with Allan Simmons, a past president of 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the old idea of a barn raising or a quilting bee, but our 
communities are so much larger now we have had to formalize the process. That's 
what this is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were Cynthia Forster, head of Forster Construction in Anaheim 
Hills, and her co-worker, Merri Jordan. Forster said she gets "a ton" of 
invitations to fund-raisers, but attends only the meetings of a business 
association and Volunteer Center parties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the cause I want to support," she said simply. "I don't have time to do 
the volunteer work myself, so this is my way of taking part."

ANN CONWAY: THE SENATOR IS TOASTED, NOT ROASTED, AT BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We couldn't roast her," Bernice Hird whispered of state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
on Friday night. "She's too nice. So, we decided to toast her!" 
</P>
<P>
And toast her they did at the Westin South Coast Plaza. From the moment 
Bergeson's husband, Garth, took the stage to reminisce about her love of 
animals ("on our early camping trips, she always wanted to pet the bears") to 
the moment B.T. Collins, assistant to the state treasurer, made a 
laugh-a-second surprise appearance, the silver-haired senator from the 37th 
District was hailed and regaled. 
</P>
<P>
There were even toasters -- the bread-roasting kind -- on the tables. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-strong supporters of the Dayle McIntosh Center for the Disabled that 
also included such political notables as state Sen. John Seymour and Orange 
County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley met for cocktails at 7 p.m. and then settled 
down to a chicken and beef dinner before the senator took the "warm" seat. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the Christmas we had Honey Baked ham and enchiladas from the Price 
Club for dinner," teased Bergeson's daughter, Julie. Of course, the implication 
was that, because of the time constraints of her career, mom has little chance 
to cook. In her retort, Bergeson assured her daughter that she would "get to 
plan the Christmas menu this year." 
</P>
<P>
During all of the remarks (including adoration-laced jabs from Bergeson's son, 
James, Judge Don Smallwood and former Newport Beach Mayor Jackie Heather) 
volunteers used sign language to convey them to deaf guests -- gestures that 
perfectly demonstrated the goal of the center. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to increase independence," said Brenda Premo, the center's 
executive director. "So the person with a disability can live as productively 
and independently as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"You can think of your life as a pie. One piece of that pie is your limitation. 
Some people have limitations that are not visible -- they can't spell, they 
can't draw. . . . But when you have a physical limitation, people see that part 
of the pie. What we try to do is decrease the effect that has on your life." 
</P>
<P>
Premo, who is legally blind, recently received her MBA from Pepperdine 
University. "We're different from other programs which serve the disabled," 
noted Premo, appointed by former President Reagan to the National Council on 
Disability. "We're consumer-run. The majority of our board consists of people 
with disabilities -- qualified professionals who also just happen to be 
disabled." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson pronounced the center "an organization we should all know more about 
and support wholeheartedly." Event proceeds were estimated at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene: event chair Terry Kerr, area manager for Southern California 
Edison; Glenn and Dottie Stillwell, close friends of the Bergesons, and Marian 
Koonce of Santa Barbara (another Reagan appointee to the national council) and 
her husband, Elmer. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion according to St. John: Designer Marie Gray not only created the St. 
John Knits, she created the star of the show staged by Nordstrom at Brea Mall 
for the Assistance League of Fullerton last Thursday. Her stunning daughter, 
Kelly, signature model for St. John, swept down the runway and re-created all 
the haute photo looks that have made her famous. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the affair was chairwoman Irene Linduski, who confessed that she 
had purchased not one but two St. John dresses because of the affair. "When I 
went out to buy the one I'm wearing, I found another, puff-sleeved dress 
cocktail number that I had to have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
League president Jan Regitz didn't don a St. John for the show and luncheon. 
But, she said, "I'm planning to choose one today." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds were estimated at more than $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Grand, grand: Court Prowell was named grand marshal of the Huntington Harbour 
Philharmonic Committee's 1989 Boat Parade at the Grand Marshal Ball on Saturday 
at the Anaheim Hilton &amp; Towers. The 26th annual ball celebrated the success 
of the Cruise of Lights, a December fund-raiser that brought $95,000 to the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society. Also on the committee: Joan Foote, Isabel

CONVERTING VENTURA HOTEL HOUSING POOR TO HOMELESS SHELTER PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen low-income families living in an old Ventura hotel could be relocated 
to make room for 21 homeless families under a plan proposed by two agencies 
serving the county's poor. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies, Project Understanding and Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., 
have launched efforts to raise $1.7 million to buy the De Anza Hotel on Ventura 
Avenue and convert it to a shelter for some of the county's 2,000 homeless 
people, officials of the nonprofit groups said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The first floor of the three-story structure, once the site of Lagomarsino's 
Wholesale Liquors, would become a center for social service agencies offering 
mental health assistance, food stamps and other referrals. 
</P>
<P>
The top floors would be renovated to provide up to 84 beds as temporary housing 
for 21 families now served in Ventura County primarily by the Zoe Christian 
Center, which offers about 360 beds at two sites in Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Set Aside 
</P>
<P>
"This would only touch a portion of the need," said Pat Driskell, executive 
director of Project Understanding, a private group that provides day services 
for the homeless. "But it's as good a situation as we can come across." 
</P>
<P>
Driskell said money had been set aside to help cover moving and relocation 
expenses for the 14 families who live there now. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see it as kicking them out," he said. "In fact, with the considerable 
amount we've budgeted, they can probably upgrade their housing conditions, 
given what they are now." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the hotel has agreed to sell it for $855,000, Driskell said. He 
said the rest of the money would go toward bringing the structure up to city 
earthquake-safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Between Project Understanding and the Cabrillo Corp., which helps develop 
housing for low-income farm workers, $150,000 has already been raised, he said. 
The rest would have to come from other cities, the county, and state and 
federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
The project is one of four on which Ventura officials are considering spending 
$238,000 set aside to buy affordable housing, said Dave Valeska, project 
manager for the community revitalization division. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army, Zoe Christian Center and the Commission on Human Concerns 
have also applied for the money. The City Council will probably make a grant 
within the next month or two, Valeska said. 
</P>
<P>
"The need is substantial," he said. "There's new homeless being created 
everyday."

FAKE KELP PROVES A REAL ANSWER TO BEACH EROSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year the ocean stole more of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Winter storms ravaged a 10-block section of shoreline, carrying away a mountain 
of sand. The ocean gradually crept closer to the posh seafront homes on the 
peninsula near Belmont Shore. 
</P>
<P>
By 1979, former Long Beach Public Works Director James T. Pott recalled, the 
problem was getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I was called out at some ungodly hour of the night because the owner of a 
house on the boardwalk was getting seawater splashed on his front windows," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach was quickly losing part of its long beach. Pott said he assured the 
man that the city would try to halt the erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal engineers were hired to find a solution. They suggested such expensive 
remedies as extending the offshore breakwater or building a sunken rock 
structure to keep the sand from washing away. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a persuasive salesman, not the engineers, who eventually provided 
the solution -- "synthetic seaweed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Problem for Boaters 
</P>
<P>
And after six years, the ersatz kelp is working so well that the city is about 
to spend another $7,000 or so to buy more. Erosion began to halt as early as 
1984, when Councilwoman Jan Hall announced the early success of the program in 
a formal paper presented at a conference in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted. It's worked," Hall said. "It's something that doesn't 
interfere with swimmers and boaters. It has stabilized the beach for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Synthetic seaweed acts like the undulating leaves of underwater plants but does 
not look anything like them. It is a barrier of plastic or glass-fiber sheeting 
that knocks down large sand particles that normally would be carried out to 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
A single unit resembles a big paint dropcloth or car cover that has been 
shredded to create strips, like fingers on a hand. A sleeve is sewn into the 
bottom, which is filled with sand that serves as an anchor. Ping-Pong balls or 
Styrofoam blocks are sewn in at the top to allow the strips to float upright. 
</P>
<P>
The units -- each about five feet high and four feet wide -- are sunk in about 
eight feet of water off the beach. Over time, Hall said, they stop enough sand 
so that the strips become buried. But the strips are still effective because 
they create mounds on the sea floor. The mounds take the energy out of the big 
waves that crash ashore, and less sand washes away. 
</P>
<P>
Most other beach communities are completely exposed to the ocean, but most of 
Long Beach's four-mile strand of sand is protected by a breakwater. Virtually 
all of Long Beach's ocean front has little more than knee-high waves except for 
the unprotected stretch running from about 60th Place to 70th Place on the 
peninsula that divides Alamitos Bay from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
There, the city has waged its years-long battle to keep the sands in place. 
Photos taken during World War II show that stretch along the peninsula 
virtually devoid of sand, with huge boulders at the base of the seawall. 
Between 1957 and 1978, the city lost five to 10 feet of beach a year to 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers Called In 
</P>
<P>
Wooden jetties running 200 feet into the ocean were constructed along the 
peninsula after the war to try to stop the erosion but did little to stabilize 
the troubled section known as East Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers pushed the sand up on the beach during winters to minimize sand loss 
during storms, and additional sand was dredged from the bay to rejuvenate the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
Pott said a number of possible solutions were being considered, some of them 
quite expensive, when he was visited by a salesman offering the phony seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
"A salesman for this stuff saw an article in the newspaper (about the erosion 
problem) and said, 'Boy, have I got a deal for you,' " Pott recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used on East Coast 
</P>
<P>
A similar installation was being credited with saving the famous lighthouse 
near Cape Hatteras, N.C., and appeared to be successful in preserving beaches 
in communities on the banks of Lake Michigan. Pott said he was intrigued enough 
to take the idea to Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Because the idea was not scientifically proven, "the risk would have been too 
high for a scared public works director to do himself," said Pott, now a 
private engineering consultant in Long Beach. "Thanks to (Hall) and her 
dealings with the community, she and the Alamitos Bay Beach Protection Assn. 
and Public Works, in concert together and knowing all the risks, decided to 
proceed." 
</P>
<P>
First, a dredge restored the beach to its original condition. Then scuba divers 
dropped 1,600 of the artificial kelp units in three rows, positioned like snow 
fences. The cost of the units was $57,500 out of the total of $950,000 spent on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Different kinds of artificial kelp were installed to see which would be most 
effective, Pott said. Glass-fiber cloth was found to resist barnacles and other 
sea growths that would weigh it down and cause it to sink. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More to Be Purchased 
</P>
<P>
Now city officials are hoping to cut the losses to erosion even more. City 
Marine Bureau Director Richard L. Miller said the next installation of 
synthetic seaweed should begin in another month or two. The City Council gave 
its blessings last week, and city purchasing officials said bids would be be 
opened this week.

SANTA CLARA STALKS A STATE BASKETBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON,, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the following information on Cardinal Newman High of Santa Rosa will be 
new to Coach Lou Cvijanovich and his Santa Clara boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara faces Cardinal Newman for the State Division IV championship Friday 
night at 7:30 at Ventura College. But that does not mean Santa Clara is 
spending the week studying film and researching the tendencies of its opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in scouting by video, especially having players watch it," 
Cvijanovich said. "We'll concern ourselves with ourselves and not our 
opponent." 
</P>
<P>
That should not be surprising to those familiar with Cvijanovich, 62, and his 
ambivalence for technology. This is a coach who says he would like "every 
television set blown up." 
</P>
<P>
What is surprising is that Tom Bonfigli, the 35-year-old coach at Cardinal 
Newman, also prepares the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't watch any video and nobody scouted Santa Clara for us," said 
Bonfigli, who is in his eighth season. "I've just talked to a lot of coaches 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
He also could observe his own team in practice to get a feeling for Santa 
Clara's style. The teams are mirror images of one another. 
</P>
<P>
Both are heavy on man-to-man defense, depth and discipline. Both are light on 
forcing the fast-break or outside shots. And both are accustomed to enjoying a 
height advantage that will be neutralized Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to play man defense, so do they," notes Bonfigli, who coached with 
Cvijanovich at a camp a few years ago. "We are kind of deliberate, so are 
they." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Newman (31-3), which qualified for the state playoffs as runner-up in 
the North Coast Section, works the ball inside to one of three starters who 
stand at least 6-foot-5. 
</P>
<P>
Center Michael Hostetter (6-6) averages 18.2 points and 10.4 rebounds. 
Hostetter, a senior, scored 29 points in Cardinal Newman's 62-57 victory over 
Archbishop Mitty of San Jose for the Northern California championship. "He 
plays well in big games," Bonfigli said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara answers with 6-7 Bubba Burrage, a big-game player in his own right. 
Burrage, a senior who averages 18.6 points and 11.1 rebounds, scored a 
game-high 19 points in the Saints' 78-55 win over Washington of Easton for the 
Southern California title. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Newman senior forwards Tom Wellborn (6-6) and Jake Johnson (6-5) are 
powerfully built players in the mold of Santa Clara forwards John McGill (6-5) 
and Foster Cole (6-4). Johnson averages 10 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara is led on offense by Shon Tarver, a 6-5 left-hander with a great 
touch. Tarver, a junior forward, averages 23 points and has shot well over 50% 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Newman's best outside shooter is 6-4 guard Sheridan Silver, who 
averages 13.6 points and will let fly from behind the three-point line. The 
fifth starter is 5-10 point guard Ryan Vice. Brad Monahan, a 6-6, 230-pound 
forward, is the top reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deeper than they are," Bonfigli said. "I play nine guys every game 
pretty equally." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara has stayed with its starting five and Cole recently after 
exhibiting great depth during the regular season. Seniors Bill Lajoie and Leon 
Palmisano are capable backups for starting guards Art Santana and Kasha 
Clemons. 
</P>
<P>
A distinct Santa Clara advantage throughout the playoffs has been the superior 
physical strength of its players. Santana and Clemons look more like bodyguards 
than basketball guards, and their enormous arms and chests are a tribute to a 
rigorous weight-lifting program. 
</P>
<P>
Bonfigli, as well, puts his players through year-round weight lifting. 
</P>
<P>
If Santa Clara has an edge, it probably comes from what amounts to a home-court 
advantage. "I know we're playing an exceptional team and they have the 
advantage of playing at home," Bonfigli said. "It should be at more of a 
neutral site, but I don't gripe about things like that." 
</P>
<P>
"Lou has one of the great programs in the state of California. I respect him as 
a foe and a great coach, there's nothing wrong with that. But there is no fear 
with the respect. We are coming to Ventura for a purpose."

AFTER A RUN OF BAD LUCK, JOHN SMITH LOSES PAIR OF ACES; 
</P>
<P>
NEW HURDLES FOR RUNNER-TURNED-COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If anyone knows of unexpected barriers one needs to conquer in life, it is John 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
An outstanding quarter-miler, Smith attended UCLA during the turbulent late 
'60s and early '70s and became active in the anti-Vietnam war and black 
nationalist movements. But Smith kept aim at his goal, to win an Olympic gold 
medal for the United States, and as the 1972 Munich games rolled around he was 
favored to finish first in 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
But then life played one of its tricks: a hamstring injury three weeks before 
the Games. He struggled to make it to the finals but pulled up around the 
second turn of a preliminary race. 
</P>
<P>
Smith would also be haunted for years by the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes by 
Arab terrorists during the Games. 
</P>
<P>
"Why my Olympic games? Why my games?" Smith asks, shaking his head. "During 
Seoul people lost medals for taking drugs. Well whoop-de-do. People were losing 
their lives when I was in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like being home during the Watts riots. I was so sick of that stuff, 
and then I went over there and I'm in a war zone again. I said to myself, 
'Damn, I can't leave this garbage.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now in his fifth season as an assistant coach in charge of sprinters for the 
UCLA track team, Smith has established himself as one of the most prominent 
coaches in the world. Four Smith-coached athletes participated in the Seoul 
Olympics and two, Danny Everett and Steve Lewis, came home with two medals 
apiece. Lewis provided Smith with some measure of redemption when he won the 
gold medal in Smith's event, the 400. 
</P>
<P>
But then another obstacle popped up. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, 
implicated Smith and dozens of other current or former athletes during a 
Canadian government inquiry into use of anabolic steroids. Francis testified 
that Smith told him that another professional coach, Pat Connolly, asked Smith 
in 1979 for dianabol for Olympic sprinter Evelyn Ashford. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he has never taken steroids nor advocates its use by his athletes. 
Smith points out that during the four months preceding the Seoul games, Lewis, 
for example, tested negative eight times for steroids. To date, none of the 
athletes coached by Smith has tested positive for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie's trying to justify why he told his athletes to take drugs and he's 
using people such as Evelyn, Pat and myself," Smith said. "We're three who have 
not been tainted, so to speak, about the use of enhancement performance drugs. 
. . . We've done our coaching day in and day out in a very mother and fatherly 
approach. Charlie's done it through science and needles and the whole nine 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie's a very intelligent coach, but he resorted to experimenting with 
people's bodies, and that's a heavy responsibility. Now he's facing the 
pitfalls of taking that route." 
</P>
<P>
Smith met Francis when Francis was a sprinter at Stanford and Smith was at 
UCLA. Like Smith, Francis suffered an injury before the Munich Games and 
couldn't compete. 
</P>
<P>
"When we met in 1980, he (Francis) was more or less into developing athletes 
though drugs," Smith said. "I wanted to do it through teaching the artful 
approach of running and the metaphysical side." 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie discussed his lack of acceptance of religion and of a higher being. . 
. . We didn't agree on anything once we started talking about things that 
weren't tangible. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known what he's done. I feel I'm a better coach because I don't have to 
use the stuff. There's only room for one at a time on top. I took my time over 
the years, and so did he, but he did it out of a bottle and I did it 
straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
As the Bruins enter this season attempting to win a third consecutive National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. title, another obstacle has fallen into Smith's path. 
Everett, who finished third in the 400 meters at Seoul and along with Lewis was 
a member of the winning U.S. 1,600-meter relay team, has opted to forgo his 
senior year to pursue commercial endorsements. The Bruins will also be without 
sprinter Henry Thomas, who has decided to redshirt this season. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of having what Smith and Coach Bob Larsen said would have been the best 
UCLA team ever -- Smith said the Bruins would have had at least 100 points at 
the NCAA finals -- UCLA finds itself in danger of having its string of 40 
consecutive dual victories broken. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to start pooling some of the people that were on the periphery last 
year," Smith said. "I don't view losing Danny as a setback. You want to have 
that kind of dilemma. That means you have great athletes. Hopefully, it may 
also mean that there's a great coach in the room." 
</P>
<P>
Coaching helps remove, as Smith puts it, an albatross that has been around his 
neck since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the Munich Games, Smith returned to the Olympic Village to take 
care of unfinished business. Gone were the bright colors of the Games and 
summer. The realities of what had happened and the darkness of fall had set in. 
The village was deserted. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was desolate. It was a ghostly feeling," Smith said. "I knew right 
then that I had work to do. I didn't know what it was or how I would do it, or 
what it was for. But I knew it was for a principle and for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years, a professional football career and an acting career later, 
Smith has found that reason. His new purpose in life is coaching or, as he 
prefers to put it, teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches would boast of "landing" a great recruit, like a Lewis, a 
sophomore. Smith speaks of "Steve entering my life." 
</P>
<P>
"I use to go into Pauley Pavilion to listen to John Wooden coach. It was 
inspiring just to listen to him," Smith said. "What he talked about transcended 
basketball. It was about life. 
</P>
<P>
"The real test of how good a coach I've been will come when their careers are 
over. When they become the world's businessmen or doctors, that will reflect on 
how good a job I did." 
</P>
<P>
Smith grew up poor in downtown Los Angeles. His father was a janitor and Smith 
washed trucks through high school. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to go to UCLA gave Smith the opportunity to be exposed to the 
same level of academics as athletics. A political science major, Smith became 
involved in the black movements on campus and wore his hair in an Afro. 
</P>
<P>
While at UCLA, Smith set the world record, which he still holds, in the 440 
yards (a race seldom run now) at 44.5 and was on two national championship 
teams. Although he was highly affected by the idealism of the times, Smith 
never got over-involved when his track career was at risk. Smith laughs when 
asked if he would have boycotted the Munich games as UCLA basketball player Lew 
Alcindor did in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only place I could express myself," Smith said. "You couldn't 
keep me away if you tied me down. That's where I drew the line. I felt the 
revolution was supposed to be about education, about helping young black 
people, like I'm doing now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some of the things that happened to us black people was a shame. . . . 
The very superficial things people look at about each other to put one in one's 
place. To say 'I'm better than thou and thou aren't capable of hanging with me 
because thou skin is lighter than mine.' All that stuff was crap." 
</P>
<P>
At Munich, his friends and teammates, Vincent Matthews and Wayne Collett, stood 
on the medal dais, having placed first and second in 400 meters. Collett and 
Mathews were banned from further competition by the International Olympic 
Committee for talking and fidgeting during the playing of "The Star-Spangled 
Banner." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the three had spoken of some protest similar to the black-power 
salute by Tommie Smith and John Carlos four years earlier in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"We were talking about doing something, then my injury threw everything off," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Munich, Smith was faced with a common dilemma of the times. Unlike today, 
amateur athletes were barred from accepting payments for running. Smith was 
also barred from earning money through his secondary occupation, acting. 
</P>
<P>
So when the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys drafted Smith in the 13th 
round in 1973, he jumped at the chance. Smith spent two years on the taxi squad 
but never played. 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, Smith encountered another barrier: Southern racism. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that in order to stay in the business of football in Dallas, I had 
to learn the art of compromise, which is letting the other guy think he got 
what he wanted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After being cut by the Cowboys on his 24th birthday, Smith ran for the 
International Track and Field Assn. and in 1978-79 ran professionally for the 
International Track Assn. in Australia where some runners were given head 
starts and races were bet on. 
</P>
<P>
Smith attempted to regain his amateur status, which he had forfeited when he 
signed with the Cowboys and ran in the ITA. He was partially successful. The 
International Amateur Athletic Foundation restored the amateur status of ITA 
athletes in 1980. Reports of the time said that Smith's testimony was a major 
factor in the IAAF's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC, however, balked at his requests. It would have been futile anyway. The 
United States boycotted the 1980 Moscow Games. 
</P>
<P>
An Achilles' tendon injury ended Smith's career in 1980, although he did run 
competitively once more. In 1984 he ran in a special 400 race at Drake Stadium 
during a dual meet between UCLA and Texas. At 33, and not having competed in 
four years, Smith ran a 46.98. UCLA's Dwyan Biggers won the dual meet 400 in 
46.4. 
</P>
<P>
For now, while Smith is concentrating on commitments to the UCLA team and the 
Santa Monica Track Club, he is also pursuing his acting career, which began as 
modeling when he was running professional track in Australia. Smith, who is 
married and has a 3-year-old daughter, has appeared in various sitcoms and had 
a cameo shot in the movie "Dragnet." He will appear in a PBS special in June 
called "The Meeting," which is a fictional account of a meeting between Martin 
Luther King and Malcolm X and is also working on a movie project dealing with 
track and field. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a runner, I complained about the problems. Heck, I was probably 
part of the problems," he said. "Now as a coach, I want to be part of the 
solution."

SPORTSSCOPE: BALANCED CAL POLY WOMEN'S SOFTBALL TEAM SURPRISES THE EXPERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's softball team was not listed in the preseason NCAA 
Division I rankings, but the Broncos have been impressive early in Big West 
Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is 7-1 in the Big West and 17-5 overall heading into a conference 
double-header at Nevada-Las Vegas at 11 a.m. Sunday. Las Vegas entered this 
week at 2-4 in conference play and 6-8 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have been led by the pitching of sophomore Nicky Luce, who has an 
8-3 record, and senior Lori Thompson, 8-2. Pomona has received solid hitting 
from outfielder Nikki Bush, shortstop Shellie McCall and catcher Denise Correa. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona suffered its first conference loss, 1-0, to 18th-ranked Pacific last 
week and then won its three games. 
</P>
<P>
While Pomona was winning three of its four conference games last week, Las 
Vegas lost three of four. The Rebels are headed by pitcher Lori Harrigan, who 
is 4-6 with a 1.60 earned-run average, and catcher Sheree Corniel, who is 
batting .333. 
</P>
<P>
Center Niki Bracken of Cal Poly Pomona, who led the Broncos to their eighth 
straight California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball championship, 
has been named the conference's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken, a 6-2 junior from Compton who was second-team all-conference last 
season, has averaged 19.8 points and 8.6 rebounds to lead the Broncos into the 
NCAA Division II quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona also placed guard Cathy Gooden on the first team while Cal State Los 
Angeles was represented on the first team by center Lupe Quintana. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, a 5-5 senior who was a first-team Division II All-American last season, 
is second in scoring for Pomona with 15.5 points and leads in assists at 5.6. 
</P>
<P>
For Quintana, a 6-0 senior, it marked the third straight year that she was 
named to the all-conference first team. She finished her career with 1,200 
rebounds -- two short of the all-time conference record. 
</P>
<P>
She is her school's all-time third-leading scorer. As a senior she averaged 
14.5 points and a conference-high 11.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona placed senior forward Susan Luckinbill (5-9) on the all-conference 
second team while Pomona guard Carrie Egan (5-8) and Cal State L.A. forward 
Tina Slatinsky (6-0) received honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
In men's basketball, Pomona's Forrest Barnes (6-5) was selected to the All-CCAA 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
Center Amy Walter of Azusa Pacific University, who led her team to a share of 
its first Golden State Athletic Conference women's basketball title, has been 
named NAIA District III Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2 junior averaged 22.3 points and 10.3 rebounds to lead the GSAC in both 
categories. She made 59.4% of her field-goal attempts and set a school record 
by scoring 30 points or more in eight games this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who finished with a 21-10 record and tied Fresno Pacific for first 
place in the GSAC at 10-2, also placed two other players on the NAIA 
All-District III team: junior forward Holly Ingersoll (5-11) and senior guard 
Tracey Emberley (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
Ingersoll, a strong inside player, averaged 13.6 points and 9.5 rebounds. 
Emberley, considered the team's top ball handler and defensive player, averaged 
5.9 points and 5.4 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Don Ruh and John Norton of Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut have been selected 
state community college cross-country Coaches of the Year by the California 
Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Norton coached the women's cross-country team to the state community college 
championship and Ruh guided the men's cross-country squad to third in the 
Southern California regionals and eighth in the state. For the women's team, it 
was its first state title in the program's 11-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora High School will play host to its second Spring Team Tennis Classic 
from Monday through Wednesday at the high school and Goddard Middle School 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Eight teams will compete in the event, including San Gabriel Valley schools 
Arroyo, Baldwin Park, Bishop Amat and Damien. Fountain Valley defeated El Toro 
for the title last year. El Toro and Burbank will also compete in the 
tournament along with the host team.

AGENCY TO LAUNCH STUDY OF FORD BRONCO II AFTER HIGH RATE OF ROLL-OVER ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government's highway safety watchdog said Wednesday that the Ford 
Bronco II appears to be involved in more fatal roll-over accidents than other 
vehicles in its class and that it will seek to determine if the vehicle itself 
contributes to the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to do an engineering analysis of the Ford Motor Co. utility-sport 
vehicle grew out of a federal accident study of the Suzuki Samurai, said Tim 
Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA 
looked at Samurai accidents after Consumer Reports magazine charged that the 
vehicle had basic design flaws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Fatalities 
</P>
<P>
However, the accident study showed that the "Ford Bronco II appears to have a 
higher number of single-vehicle, first event roll-overs, particularly those 
involving fatalities," Hurd said. The engineering analysis of the Bronco, the 
second of three levels of investigation conducted by NHTSA, will cover the 
1984-1989 Bronco II models, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Fatal Accident Reporting System study included in the September 
report on the Samurai, 43 Bronco II single-vehicle roll-overs caused 
fatalities, or 19 of every 100,000 vehicles. There were eight Samurai fatal 
roll-overs, or 6 per 100,000; 13 involving the Chevrolet S10 Blazers or GMC 
Jimmy, or 6 per 100,000, and six fatal Jeep Cherokee roll-overs, for 2.5 per 
100,000. After the accident report, NHTSA declined to investigate the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, a Ford spokeswoman said the involvement of the Bronco II in fatal 
roll-over accidents "isn't significantly" different from that of other utility 
vehicles. "The Bronco II is well designed and is safe. I don't think this 
reflects the design or engineering of the vehicle," spokeswoman Joyce Stinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stresses Safe Driving 
</P>
<P>
She said fatal roll-over accidents are "strongly influenced" by the driver's 
age and training and whether alcohol is involved. The type of terrain the 
vehicle is being driven on is another factor, Stinson said, as well as whether 
the driver is attempting some extraordinary maneuver with the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The utility vehicles have different handling capabilities, Stinson said, thus 
Ford stresses safe driving in its manuals for vehicle owners. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd said NHTSA investigators will analyze roll-over accidents involving the 
Bronco II to determine if environment, the types of drivers or the vehicle 
itself might have contributed to the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
In denying the petitions for an investigation of the Samurai, the agency said a 
high proportion of the roll-over victims were young, inexperienced drivers. 
Alcohol consumption was evident in 50% of the accidents, NHTSA said. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations against the Samurai spurred calls for NHTSA to adopt roll-over 
standards covering all vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rated 'Not Acceptable' 
</P>
<P>
The Samurai, a popular product of American Suzuki Motor Corp., came under 
attack last June. Consumer Reports magazine, published by Consumers Union, gave 
the Japanese vehicle its first "not acceptable" rating in a decade because of 
what the group said were basic design flaws. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said the Samurai presented an unsafe combination of a high center 
of gravity, a narrow tread width and a light weight. It said tests revealed 
that the Samurai showed a dangerous tendency to roll over when performing 
relatively routine maneuvers at relatively low speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers Union petitioned NHTSA for a full-scale investigation that could have 
led to a mandatory recall if the agency found the allegations valid.

DEFENSE FIRMS PROTEST L.A. OFFICE'S TARDY BILL PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An administrative crisis at the Pentagon's main business office in Los Angeles 
has prompted an unusual protest this week in Washington by aerospace 
contractors, who say they are not being paid for their defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Many smaller companies say they are being driven to virtual insolvency by the 
crisis. Larger prime contractors have had to increase their borrowing by 
millions of dollars to offset the unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
The problems are occurring at the Los Angeles regional headquarters of the 
Defense Contract Administration Service, a Department of Defense agency that is 
responsible for paying contractors in nine Western states. 
</P>
<P>
A delegation of industry officials, including representatives from Hughes 
Aircraft, Northrop and RAND, met in Washington this week with Defense 
Department bureaucrats to raise objections about the serious delays in 
payments. Senior Defense Department officials pledged Tuesday to consider 
hiring a Big Eight accounting firm to resolve the snafus at the Los Angeles 
DCAS office, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A DCAS spokesman said the problems are 80% resolved and that many of the 
contractors are "all wet" in their allegations. But executives of major firms 
and sole proprietors of small businesses say that there has been little if any 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
RAND, a think tank in Santa Monica that depends heavily on Pentagon contracts, 
has had to double its line of credit to cover unpaid bills by the Defense 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs us $100,000 per month in additional interest, and that is not 
reimbursable by the government," said Robert Judson, RAND's director of 
contracts, who attended the meeting in Washington. "We are a nonprofit 
corporation." 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a payment situation as bad as we have ever been in," Judson said. 
"Things are getting worse. One of the big issues is the disconnect of reality 
between what is actually going on and what is being reported to headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is far worse for small companies that lack the financial resources 
to weather the crisis or to fly to Washington to protest. International Marine 
Engineering in Long Beach, for example, may have to close up shop because of 
past due invoices, according to the company's owner, Marvin Chappel. 
</P>
<P>
Glo-Ed Inc., a small Southern California computer supplier, has been waiting 
months for a $225,000 check from DCAS, according to the company's Jerry Edgar. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a call from the Air Force saying they were in dire need of data 
cartridges for their spy planes and to please ship them without a contract," 
Edgar said. "We did that -- but now we can't get paid." 
</P>
<P>
The DCAS office in Los Angeles is run by Air Force Brig. Gen. John Serur, who 
has declined repeated requests by The Times for an interview during the past 
year. Serur has also refused to meet with contractors who are pleading to get 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
"He will not talk to a contractor," Judson said. "He is either in a meeting or 
on the telephone. We have hand-carried documents there, and Gen. Serur would 
not give us 15 minutes of his time. Our situation is desperate." 
</P>
<P>
RAND is not alone in saying that DCAS officials are often indifferent to their 
payment problems. Donna Winter, owner of Technical Research Associates in 
Camarillo, has been trying to collect bills from DCAS. She said she has often 
been disconnected when she has telephoned the agency. DCAS has a special 
customer assistance line, but disconnects and long waits are not unusual, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To help resolve the problems, Defense Department officials pledged at a meeting 
Tuesday to conduct a hearing in Los Angeles to look into the nonpayment 
problem. They also agreed to consider hiring a Big Eight accounting firm to 
assist the Los Angeles office in resolving the problems. 
</P>
<P>
But after the meeting, industry officials were less than certain that enough 
would be done because, they said, they doubt that Washington officials know 
enough about what is going on in Los Angeles. William Cassell, comptroller of 
the Defense Logistics Agency, DCAS' parent organization, characterized the 
meeting as friendly, according to an agency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Cassell also cited statistics that indicated an 80% 
reduction in late payments by DCAS in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One device that DCAS has apparently used to cut its backlog of unpaid invoices 
is to reject or lose paper work and demand that contractors resubmit their 
requests. That resets the clock to zero and makes it look as though DCAS has 
cleared up its backlog of unpaid bills, even though the invoices are still 
unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
For example, RAND has submitted the same documents as many as three or four 
times and has made more than 100 total resubmissions of documents in only the 
past 2 1/2 months, Judson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are bordering on administrative gridlock," he said. "It is pretty grim." 
</P>
<P>
RAND has written 13 letters to Serur and has not received a response, Judson 
said. "That is outrageous in the protocol of government," the RAND official 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon hopes to resolve the entire DCAS problem within two months by 
creating a new payment center in Columbus, Ohio, that was announced last month. 
It will take over first from the Los Angeles office but later also from other 
DCAS regional offices around the country. 
</P>
<P>
However, industry officials are worried that such a large, centralized 
bureaucracy will be even less responsive to local problems. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the transfer of payment responsibilities to Columbus on May 1 is 
expected to create additional confusion. DCAS has reportedly hired only 150 
people for about 2,600 jobs at the Columbus payment center. 
</P>
<P>
A treasurer of a major Los Angeles aerospace firm also said he is worried about 
a DCAS plan to send all of its payment records to Columbus by truck. "How many 
days will that take?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Forrest Flewellen, a public affairs officer for the new Columbus payment 
center, said concerns about the facility, which will occupy a former aircraft 
plant, are unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not out in some hangar," he said. "We are using office complexes. They 
have magnificent entryways and hallways. We are taking pictures of the offices 
and will send them out" to Los Angeles.

Defying the Bush Administration, the House on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly 
for legislation that would force President Bush to form an emergency board to 
investigate and report on the Eastern Airlines strike. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which passed by a 252-167 margin after heated debate along 
partisan lines, must still be acted upon by the Senate, where its chances are 
uncertain. Then, the measure would have to be signed by Bush, who is being 
advised by Administration officials to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
The bill directs the President to empanel the board, as authorized under the 
Railway Labor Act, in order to help solve the impasse among Eastern, the 
International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Air Line Pilots 
Assn., and the Transport Workers Union of America. The machinists struck March 
4 after refusing Eastern's demand for $125 million a year in wage and benefit 
concessions, and virtually all of the airline's pilots and flight attendants 
have refused to cross picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
If the board were formed, its practical effect would be to provide a 
"cooling-off period" of 21 days during which striking workers would have to 
return to their jobs. Under the legislation, Bush would be allowed to extend 
that period by another five days. 
</P>
<P>
During the floor debate, opposition centered on contentions that there is not a 
crisis in the transportation system and that the parties should work out their 
differences among themselves and allow Eastern's filing for protection from 
creditors under the bankruptcy laws to play itself out in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
One opponent, Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt (R-Ark.), said creation of the board 
"cannot be justified on either legal or policy grounds." 
</P>
<P>
"Although there is some inconvenience to passengers," Hammerschmidt said, "the 
Eastern strike has not caused the sort of deprivation of essential 
transportation that would justify an emergency board under the law." Other 
carriers, he said, can adjust their schedules to accommodate passengers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the measure asserted that the bill would help save Eastern, 
the jobs of its employees and the communities that depend on the airline for 
their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), chairman of the Committee on 
Public Works and Transportation, said, "Eastern's demise would be an economic 
disaster; it would cause the loss of up to 30,000 jobs and a billion-dollar 
payroll, as well as substantial economic damage" to communities nationwide with 
Eastern Airlines operations. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, Eastern's unions lauded the House action while Eastern officials 
criticized it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that the House acted quickly," said Charles Bryan, head of 
the striking machinists union local. "While the President was not in favor of 
taking action earlier, he might now not want to be identified as promoting the 
interests of Frank Lorenzo," who is head of the Texas Air holding company that 
owns Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jack Bavis, chairman of Eastern's pilots union local, was also pleased by 
the vote. "We are gratified to find that the members of Congress realize the 
necessity of appointing a board in an attempt to reach a fair and equitable 
agreement in the labor-management dispute at our airline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said, "We are still against it." He 
added that creation of an emergency board to investigate the dispute would be 
"blatant interference with the collective-bargaining process and is being 
sought for no reason other than to maintain the status quo that is creating 
extensive daily losses at Eastern." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted defeat for the legislation in the Senate and noted that the House 
vote was not large enough for the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill 
over a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of airlines denied reports that they have raised ticket 
prices and increased fare restrictions as a result of the strike, which has 
grounded more than 90% of Eastern's flights. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Colodny, chairman and president of USAir Group, told a group of airline 
analysts in New York on Wednesday that he does not expect his firm's USAir 
subsidiary to benefit significantly from the strike. He said, however, that 
Piedmont Airlines, which is also owned by USAir Group, probably will grow in 
the Southeastern U.S. markets where it competes directly with Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
A USAir spokesman, David Shipley, said later that the airline has not raised 
any fares since the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Jackie Pate said Delta also has not raised fares as 
a result of the strike. She conceded, however, that it has tightened ticket 
restrictions in some markets. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines said it has not raised fares and has not changed the number 
of seats sold at a discount. A lot of such Maxsaver fares had already been sold 
out before the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
Midway Airlines, a regional discount airline, said its Chicago-to-Miami and 
Chicago-to-Atlanta coach fares have been raised $10 one-way. But spokeswoman 
Sandra Allen said the new fares had been set before the onset of the strike and 
that the timing was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, a Texas Air spokesman, Art Kent, refused to confirm or 
deny reports that the New York investment bank of Drexel Burnham Lambert had 
been asked to find a buyer for Eastern. But he did not deny that Eastern is on 
the auction block.

FUROR OVER FRUIT FROM CHILE; 
</P>
<P>
PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
STABILITY NOW -- BUT WHOLESALERS ARE WORRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Supermarket fruit prices remained relatively stable Wednesday despite the 
controversies surrounding the safety of fresh fruit, but on the wholesale 
market there were ominous signs of change because of altered supply and demand. 
Prices of fresh Central American bananas and California-Arizona oranges were 
sharply higher in wholesale markets on Wednesday while apple prices slumped. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal-State Market News Service in Los Angeles reported that a 40-pound 
carton of bananas from Central America fetched more than $13, compared to 
$11-$12 a week earlier. Navel oranges from California and Arizona sold for an 
average price of $9.50 to $10 per 38-pound box, up from $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
Bananas and navel oranges have commanded relatively strong prices so far this 
season, said Terry Long of the price-monitoring service. But the voluntary 
recall of Chilean grapes and other fruits that offer June-in-January shopping 
for North American consumers can only push the prices of remaining available 
fresh fruits higher. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Koff, president of the Southern California Grocers Assn., said little 
change has shown up in retail prices of either fresh produce or canned fruits, 
but added: "As Day 3 goes by we're getting a little anxious about how long it 
will be before the government starts to release fruit that's already been 
cleared." 
</P>
<P>
Even assuming that Chilean fruit returns to supermarket produce departments, 
however, "there's the question of consumer confidence, too," Koff said. "That's 
going to have to be restored." 
</P>
<P>
According to the marketing news service, which is jointly run by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture, apple prices are showing the effects of reduced demand. Scores of 
school districts -- including Los Angeles Unified and others in New York, 
Chicago and San Francisco -- have removed the fruit and apple products from 
lunch menus. School officials are concerned that children might be harmed by 
residues of a chemical, daminozide, which was used on about 5% of the nation's 
apple crop to slow ripening and improve crispness and color. 
</P>
<P>
Extra fancy Washington State Red Delicious apples apparently felt the effect of 
those bans: Crates that sold for up to $20 on March 7 fell to $18-$20 this week 
"with a few as low as $14 to $16," Long reported. "Business definitely is 
slower on apples." 
</P>
<P>
Between Chile's fruit holdup and the schools' apple bans, organic produce 
markets across California reported dramatic increases in produce sales. In 
Southern California, the six outlets of Sherman Oaks-based Mrs. Gooch's Natural 
Food Stores reported record sales. And Ted McCaskey, manager of Erewhon Natural 
Foods in Los Angeles, estimated a 5% increase in customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely have more people coming in," said Jimmy Ilson, a produce worker 
with Real Food Co., a chain of six markets in San Francisco and Marin County. 
"A lot of more mainstream people are coming in -- people who would be shopping 
at Safeway." 
</P>
<P>
The Good Nature Grocery store in Walnut Creek, a 20-year-old natural foods 
store, reported that vegetable sales have jumped by more than 30% while sales 
of organic juices increased sixfold. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more apples are on the way -- from Chile. 
</P>
<P>
The refrigerated freighter Creole unloaded the first dribble of apples -- 960 
boxes -- in Los Angeles on Wednesday, but the Canadian Reefer is expected to 
unload 20,000 more cases, along with other Chilean fruits, in Long Beach today. 
On the East Coast, Philadelphia awaits the Choapa Reefer with 31,000 cases of 
Granny Smiths and the Jambu with 23,000; the Bongo Reefer is due to call at 
Tampa, Fla., with another 14,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
As the imported fruit begins to pile up in warehouses, liability for any lost 
sales sharply increases, observed Curtis W. Keyes, president of Marine 
Management Insurance Brokers in Newport Beach. Keyes' 6-year-old company 
specializes in what he called "cargo-rejection" insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually the last fellow who paid the bill winds up with the liability of the 
loss," Keyes said. "And it depends upon the purchasing power of the customer on 
what sort of adjustment might be made against future purchases." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, few fruit importers carry protection against cargo-rejection by 
regulatory action -- coverage that is more common in the higher-risk seafood 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"They might have coverage for, say, an infestation, picking up the fumigation 
costs," Keyes said. "But ultimately, the liability will probably be passed down 
the line, perhaps to the suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"Or, if the condition is found to be so localized that a good deal of this 
fruit can be released, those in the distribution chain will perhaps agree to 
some kind of sharing of the costs," he suggested.

MCorp Estimates Big Loss: MCorp, the second-largest bank company in Texas and 
the latest to receive a federal bailout, estimated that it lost $903 million 
last year. The Dallas-based firm, which operates 26 banks throughout Texas, 
lost $213 million in the fourth quarter -- more than its $174-million loss for 
all of 1987, according to quarterly documents filed with the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. But MCorp has been fighting to resurrect itself. In October, 
its management asked FDIC for $1 billion to supplement $400 million in private 
capital it lined up for a restructuring. The company has also raised $630 
million by shedding assets.

BROAD SUPPORT GIVEN SWEEPING HOUSING BILL; 
</P>
<P>
WOULD PROVIDE HELP FOR FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and other senators introduced sweeping 
legislation Wednesday that would make home ownership easier for first-time 
buyers and provide about $4.1 billion to state and local governments to 
increase affordable rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, likely to be the most significant housing proposal to come before the 
101st Congress, has drawn bipartisan support and stands a good chance of being 
embraced by the Bush Administration, despite its cost, Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that we reverse a decade of neglect in housing policy in this 
country," he said during a press conference, flanked by the bill's main 
Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). "It's deplorable that 
young families, even with two wage earners, have been priced out of housing 
markets across the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston conceded that the Administration has yet to take a position on the 
bill but noted that Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp was 
"very enthusiastic" about the proposal in recent meetings, especially sections 
designed to bring young, two-paycheck families into the home ownership market 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a new attitude in this Administration toward the government's 
role in housing," D'Amato added. "You're going to see an Administration that 
looks to work with Congress on this issue, to get something done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Lift Limit 
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, which is co-sponsored by 25 senators, the federal 
government would allow home buyers to use funds in their individual retirement 
accounts or 401(k) retirement plans to make down payments on homes. The benefit 
would be restricted to people who have not owned a home in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the bill would remove the current $101,250 limit for mortgages under 
which buyers may participate in the Federal Home Administration mortgage 
assistance program. Instead, purchasers could qualify for federal assistance on 
mortgages that are no more than 95% of a state's median home sales price. 
</P>
<P>
In California, which has some of the highest housing prices in the nation, the 
FHA ceiling would be raised to $155,000, enabling more families to qualify for 
assistance, Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato, citing studies by private housing experts, said 500,000 families 
across the country could have been helped to buy homes in 1987, had the new 
provisions been in effect. 
</P>
<P>
A second goal of the bill would be to expand the nation's dwindling supply of 
affordable rental housing, especially for lower-income people. Under the 
measure, the federal government would provide $3 billion to state and local 
governments that are sponsoring housing programs in concert with private 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would distribute these funds through a new HUD agency called 
the Housing Opportunity Program.

Pact With Inter-American Bank: The Bush Administration has ended a 
two-year-long impasse with Latin American governments over the Inter-American 
Development Bank and has agreed to a major expansion of the 44-country 
institution's lending resources. The accord, which climaxes three years of 
negotiations, will virtually double the available lending resources of the IDB 
-- to $22.5 billion over the next four years. It also will allow the bank to 
make broad-scale loans designed to help debtor countries overhaul their own 
economic policies. Under the compromise, a loan can be delayed for up to two 
months at the request of any one board member; two members could delay it for 
an additional five months.

CURACAVI, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in a town accustomed to earthquakes, people are finding it impossible to 
fathom the worldwide shock waves emanating from their two bad grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Curacavi, a town of 8,000 residents west of Santiago that built its future on 
grapes and other fruits for export, now is collectively dumbfounded. And many 
here and elsewhere in Chile are directing their growing anger at the United 
States, accusing it of caving in to economic terrorism and even of threatening 
Chile's transition to democracy by overreacting to the poison threat. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ban on importing Chilean fruits, imposed Monday after the discovery of 
traces of cyanide in two grapes out of a crate from a Curacavi farm, already 
has thrown tens of thousands of grape pickers, truck drivers and dock workers 
out of work, industry spokesmen said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the Chilean harvest, picking and shipping have been halted 
until at least Friday while the fruit is inspected to assure foreign buyers 
that it is safe. 
</P>
<P>
In the eye of the storm is Julia Saavedra's tidy farm, a couple of miles 
outside of Curacavi on the road from Santiago to the port city of Valparaiso. 
U.S. officials say it is the source of the tainted fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"For two grapes, how can they do so much damage?" asked Andres Undurraga 
Saavedra, the owner's son, who manages the 125-acre farm and its modest 
fruit-packing plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, when all Chileans want to return to democracy, they want to destroy this 
possibility," he said. "What the U.S. government has done now is to help world 
terrorism . . . . By reacting so drastically, this is encouraging it to happen 
again. It's like hijackings. If you give in, you encourage others." 
</P>
<P>
Undurraga said that, if the Americans are certain that the grapes came from his 
family's farm, they should have banned his grapes alone, not all fruit products 
from Chile. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an aggression against the entire country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Bush to Eat Grapes 
</P>
<P>
To restore American government credibility, internationally and with its own 
consumers, Undurraga proposed, "President George Bush should explain that it 
was an error, and he should eat Chilean grapes in front of the cameras." 
</P>
<P>
While Undurraga chatted with a reporter, government agriculture inspectors 
checked the fruit-packing plant on the flat plain of the Curacavi Valley, 
surrounded by dry, brown peaks. The conveyor belts in the open-sided packing 
shed were idle, and about 20,000 cases of green and red seedless table grapes 
were stacked to the ceiling in the three-story brick refrigeration building. 
</P>
<P>
The grape grower said that a key element of successful exporting is quality 
control, on which Chilean producers pride themselves: "(Sales) have grown in 
the United States because we have met the high demands of consumers there." 
</P>
<P>
He said his workers clean each bunch, sort the grapes according to quality and 
then pack them for storage until the grapes are fumigated, just before export. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Chilean nor U.S. officials have indicated whether they think the grapes 
were laced with cyanide in the field, in packing, at the docks in Valparaiso or 
during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employs 200 Workers 
</P>
<P>
With its production of 80,000 crates a year, built up over 10 years, the 
Saavedra farm has grown to be No. 2 in grape output in the valley. Along with a 
permanent staff of 20, the operation employs up to 200 workers during the 
growing and harvest season -- December to April in the Southern Hemisphere, 
perfect timing for delivering fruit to winter-bound northern countries. 
</P>
<P>
"This damages the whole Chilean economy as much as an earthquake -- or worse, 
because, with an earthquake, you know what happened and what you have to do 
afterwards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 workers milled around angrily outside the farm gate on the highway 
Wednesday morning after demanding in vain that they be paid a month's dismissal 
wages. They had been told Tuesday to go home until operations are resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Their complaints reflect part of the Chilean dichotomy: impressive overall 
economic growth that has not been translated into much well-being for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing President Augusto Pinochet, the army general who took power in a 
1973 coup, relied heavily on Chile's export boom in his unsuccessful campaign 
in October for eight more years in power. He emphasized the growth of fruit 
sales abroad, which have more than doubled in five years to $585 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Saavedra farm workers say they are paid 700 pesos a day, or less 
than $3, with no benefits. They formed a union in January with others in the 
valley, but no grower has agreed to negotiate with them, the union president, 
Guido Flores, said. 
</P>
<P>
"The government talks of exports, of growth, but we don't see it. It doesn't 
reach us," he said. "We want to share in the progress of Chile, too." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether any of the workers might have poisoned the grapes, the men, 
most of them in their teens and 20s, responded nearly in unison: "Why would we 
deny ourselves work?" 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Reyes, 42, said the only positive aspect of the crisis was that "it might 
call attention to how they treat us." 
</P>
<P>
A workers' neighborhood of one-room brick row houses in the town exemplifies a 
government achievement, providing cheap housing, but it also underscores the 
hardships that the people face here. In the Carol Urzua district, named for a 
kidnaped and assassinated general, young Jaime Oyanadel said he had not worked 
since February. He said nine people live in his 3-year-old house, which 
measures about 15 feet by 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said the government recently had sold mortgages for the houses to a 
private firm, which was now demanding back payments, and many families feared 
eviction. Chile's campaign to privatize industries and public services has been 
a cornerstone of government policy. 
</P>
<P>
One mother, Noemi Toro, said diarrhea among children is common, many families 
make do with potatoes as a staple and crime has increased because people earn 
so little from the seasonal farm work. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Julio Sagredo said the crisis would affect at least 2,000 people, a 
quarter of the town's population, who work in the fruit industry. "It's like 
after an earthquake -- you can't estimate the damage immediately." He said the 
most recent major quake occurred in 1985 and demolished 85% of the buildings in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Among the townspeople and an additional 8,000 people who live throughout the 
valley, the mayor said, the reaction has been "surprise and incredulity." 
</P>
<P>
At the agricultural cooperative near the quiet, tree-lined town square, manager 
Eduardo Araya said the 80 members were reeling from the U.S. ban and saying: 
"This can't be, this is a thing without a name," that is, indescribable. 
</P>
<P>
All work has stopped. That means not only at farms and packinghouses but 
transport and related businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is strange to me that the United States is prejudicing all of Chile," Araya 
continued. "How did they know where to look (for the bad grapes)? There is a 
black hand in this, I am sure." 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone seek to sabotage the economy, especially after Pinochet's 
defeat in the plebiscite, which put Chile on the road toward open elections? 
Araya was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"There is jealousy everywhere because this country has been growing so fast 
under Pinochet," he replied. "Some people might do anything to hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Araya said inspectors were checking all operations in the valley, which he 
compared to California -- long, narrow, mountainous and perfect for fruit. 
</P>
<P>
In Santiago, the national capital, government officials refused to say what 
direction their investigation is taking. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the State Bank, Alvaro Bardon, told reporters that the crisis 
could "signify that the transition (to democracy) could be frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Bardon said that, given the damage to the national economy, emergency measures 
might be needed "that would not be consistent with maintaining the normal 
political order." 
</P>
<P>
Bardon, who had been a major Pinochet campaigner last year, added that, "when 
there are serious economic crises, democracies collapse . . . . This is a 
measure of aggression by the United States, of a sector of the State Department 
(and) by certain Chilean political sectors . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The focus of Chilean anger appeared to shift on Tuesday from communism to the 
American decision itself with a statement by Adm. Jose Merino, the military 
junta member for the navy, who described the U.S. ban as "one of the many 
despicable acts that the United States has carried out against our country 
since independence." He said the United States is disposed "to take up anything 
that is against the Chilean government."

LIKABLE DICK CHENEY CAN GET MAD WHEN HE HAS TO

<TEXT>
<P>
This time, mild-mannered Dick Cheney was really mad. House Speaker Jim Wright 
had broken the one ironclad rule of politics: a deal is a deal. 
</P>
<P>
After barely losing a key vote on a budget bill in October, 1987, Wright 
adjourned the House temporarily, reconvened it shortly afterward and twisted 
the rules to bring the measure up immediately for another vote. Wright let all 
time for voting expire, then won back the allegiance of a Texas Democrat who 
had strayed on the issue -- thus carrying the bill for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Cheney, then the third-ranking Republican in the House, 
unleashed his anger in an interview with the National Journal, a magazine 
widely read on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Wright a "heavy-handed son of a bitch," Cheney accused the Speaker of 
arrogant abuse of power. "He doesn't know any other way to operate," Cheney 
fumed, "and he will do anything he can to win at any price, including ignoring 
the rules, bending rules, writing rules, denying the House the opportunity to 
work its will. It brings disrespect on the House itself." 
</P>
<P>
Was this Dick Cheney, the soft-spoken conciliator, the political scholar who 
can disagree without being disagreeable? The man President Bush described last 
week as "a thoughtful, a quiet man"? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely, says his wife, Lynne V. Cheney, director of the National Endowment 
for the Humanities. "It's a quiet, cold sort of anger, not an outburst," she 
said. It's a tool, one he uses selectively, but to great effect, she added. 
</P>
<P>
And on the rare occasions that her husband loses his temper, it is usually at 
"somebody double-dealing, somebody not keeping a bargain," she said in an 
interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Cheney, 48, today is on the verge of being confirmed -- anointed, some say 
-- as the nation's 17th secretary of defense. He is portrayed by political 
friends and rivals alike as bright, articulate, fair, unflappable and eminently 
likable. 
</P>
<P>
But he will need to be tough, too, and sometimes angry, as he moves across the 
Potomac to the Pentagon, which sits mired in scandal and virtually paralyzed by 
an absence of top managers in the aftermath of the nasty and prolonged 
confirmation battle over John Tower, President Bush's first choice as defense 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, a Wyoming Republican in his sixth term in the House, is everything 
former Texas Sen. Tower is not. Cheney is balding, gray-suited and soothing; 
Tower is pomaded, London-tailored and abrasive. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney is cool, Tower is hot. Cheney is dull, Tower is sharp. Cheney has no 
enemies on the Hill. Tower, in the end, did not have enough friends. 
</P>
<P>
And Cheney shortly will be defense secretary. Tower will not. 
</P>
<P>
Former Rep. Tom Loeffler (R-Tex.), a close friend and political ally of both 
Cheney and Bush, said that no one could serve Bush better than Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a strong, stable and stout negotiator," Loeffler said. "Dick has 
tremendous respect and credibility among his peers in the House and Senate and 
on both sides of the aisle. There is no question that the President's selection 
of Dick Cheney is a slam dunk." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney came to Washington as a young man in the late 1960s, quickly rising by 
virtue of brains and astute connections to become former President Gerald R. 
Ford's chief of staff in 1975-1977. After Ford was defeated in his bid for 
election in 1976, Cheney was briefly a banker in Washington, then moved back to 
his native Wyoming to run for the state's sole seat in the House. 
</P>
<P>
During that campaign, Cheney good-humoredly made a point of the fact that he is 
not a lawyer or a Washington sharpie. Referring to his home town, Cheney used 
to tell delighted crowds: "It was so cold up in Casper that all the lawyers had 
their hands in their own pockets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small-Town Exchange 
</P>
<P>
At another point in the race, Cheney entered a small town, stopped by the 
saloon in search of votes and found one elderly voter alone at the bar. Cheney 
introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
"You a Democrat?" the man asked. "Nope," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
"You a lawyer?" the man asked. "Nope," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll vote for you," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney demonstrated a sense of humor and a healthy dose of humility during that 
campaign, his first run for public office, after suffering the first of his 
three heart attacks early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
After spending several weeks recovering, he formed a mythical group called 
"Cardiacs for Cheney" and wrote a highly personal two-page letter to all the 
state's Republicans, explaining that he had given up his three-pack-a-day 
cigarette addiction and learned a lot about life from the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"No one," he later told reporters, "had ever tried the heart-attack gimmick 
before." 
</P>
<P>
It worked. He won the 1978 race and has been unassailable ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough as nails when he needs to be," said Republican Jack Gage, who lost 
a 1978 primary race to Cheney. "He's like a father who doesn't need to raise 
his voice." 
</P>
<P>
For Wyoming's citizens, Dick and Lynne Cheney's childhood in Casper and their 
ascent into Washington's political stratosphere has been "like a movie script," 
as long-time family friend Mary Meyer of Casper put it last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the same guy with the funny little smile -- quiet, steady, good for his 
word," said another childhood chum, Michael Golden, now a Wyoming Supreme Court 
justice. "You don't see anything he does or says that suggests he considers 
himself important. He puts on no airs." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's small-town childhood was undiluted Norman Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Marjorie Cheney, said that as a young child Dick would sit for long 
stretches on his grandfather's lap while he read the Saturday Evening Post 
aloud. The Cheneys built a modest ranch house on the edge of the Casper city 
limits, where the side yard extended out for miles of high prairie to the 
mountains east of town. Dick delivered the Casper Star-Tribune and worked at 
the dime store in town. 
</P>
<P>
His boyhood friend Joseph Meyer, now Wyoming's attorney general, recalled that 
his and Cheney's families could not afford a motorboat for water skiing. So 
they improvised, making crude water skis from old boards and using Meyer's 1950 
Plymouth convertible to pull skiers along an irrigation ditch. 
</P>
<P>
The boys met for weekly poker games in Cheney's parents' garage. They shot 
pool, fished in nearby streams and hunted rabbits on the plains outside of 
town. On Saturday night, said Cheney friend David Nicholas, a former Wyoming 
state senator, they would cruise Casper's main drag "from one A&amp;W root beer 
joint to the other" and park with girlfriends on C Hill overlooking town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Age of Innocence' 
</P>
<P>
"It was an age of innocence," said Karen Nicholas, another Casperite who grew 
up and married her high school sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
Dick, the brainy captain of the football team and senior class president, fell 
in love with Lynne Anne Vincent, the studious homecoming queen and chief of the 
baton squad. A six-year courtship spanned their early college years and 
culminated in a 1964 wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Casper oilman Tom Stroock, a Yale graduate, saw in Cheney "the kind of young 
man I would like to see Wyoming send out in the world." He persuaded Cheney to 
apply to his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
But for Cheney, Yale was a painful encounter with unfamiliar territory and 
better-prepared classmates from the nation's top prep schools and big suburban 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped out after his second year, having lost his scholarship because of 
poor grades. He returned to Casper and worked as an electrician, laying power 
lines from F. E. Warren Air Force Base to ballistic missile silos. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to college classes at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, he 
was more serious and more comfortable with his surroundings and his classmates. 
After he earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in political science, he 
and Lynne moved to Madison, Wis., to pursue advanced degrees at the University 
of Wisconsin in 1966. He never finished his, but she earned a doctorate in 
19th-Century British literature. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney is remembered by his former professors at the University of Wisconsin as 
an outstanding student, a serious, scholarly type who successfully juggled the 
demands of graduate school, family and jobs as both a teaching assistant and a 
staff aide to Wisconsin Gov. Warren Knowles, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"During that period of time, the University of Wisconsin was second only to 
Berkeley as a so-called hotbed of student unrest, but many of us attended 
graduate school at the time without getting caught up in that," said Gerald 
Whitburn, who was a student there at the same time as Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
He avoided the military because his family and his student status won him 
deferment from the draft. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of his professors, Cheney won a congressional fellowship. He 
worked for the late Wisconsin Rep. William A. Steiger and met then-Rep. Donald 
H. Rumsfeld of Illinois, who became his friend and mentor. 
</P>
<P>
After his brief career on Capitol Hill, Cheney took a succession of jobs in 
Richard M. Nixon's Administration, serving as assistant to the director of the 
Office of Economic Opportunity, White House staff aide and assistant director 
of the Cost of Living Council under Rumsfeld. 
</P>
<P>
When Nixon resigned in 1974, President Ford appointed Rumsfeld White House 
chief of staff, with Cheney as deputy. A year later, when Rumsfeld became 
secretary of defense, Cheney moved into the chief of staff job at age 34. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always been mature past his years," said David Hume Kennerly, a 
photographer who served with Cheney in the Ford White House. 
</P>
<P>
Kennerly recalled that Cheney also had a knack for finding solutions to sticky 
political problems. Cheney thought that Ford looked stupid wearing all the hats 
that people presented him as gifts and he did not want any more front-page 
pictures of the President in ludicrous headgear. When a West Virginia 
politician insisted on presenting the President with a coonskin cap, Cheney 
found a way out -- to nail the cap to a board so that Ford couldn't wear it. 
</P>
<P>
"The perfect solution to a difficult problem," Kennerly said. "Cheney could 
deal with a small matter or a big one with equal aplomb." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Buchen, Ford's White House counsel, said that the chief of staff job 
under Ford was not what it was under Nixon or, later, Ronald Reagan. Cheney did 
not function as Ford's principal adviser and door-keeper, Buchen said, 
insteading serving as coordinator of the work of other top staffers. 
</P>
<P>
After Ford's close loss to Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election, Cheney went to 
work for the small Washington investment house of Bradley Woods &amp; Co., 
where he did research on economic and legislative issues. "I can't think of 
anything he's not qualified to do," said the firm's vice president, Tony Brush. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney quickly grew restless and decided to run for Congress. Moving to 
Capitol Hill as a first-term lawmaker after holding a top White House job was a 
difficult adjustment, but one Cheney handled deftly, according to Rep. Tony 
Coelho (D-Merced). 
</P>
<P>
"His problem was, did he come in as freshman or as former chief of staff? He 
came as a freshman," Coelho said. "He understood his role and he performed it 
excellently. So well, in fact, that he quickly gained the trust and support of 
his colleagues and ended up in a leadership role." 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Cheney was unanimously elected minority whip, the House 
Republicans' second-ranking post. He was able to unite the party's radical 
right-wingers with its moderate and progressive blocs because of his 
personality and his diligence in defending his party's -- and his President's 
-- interests in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
As the ranking House Republican on the Iran-Contra investigating committee in 
1987, Cheney won a reputation as a hard-liner in support of President Reagan 
and his aides. He fought hard on rules of evidence and argued persuasively that 
the President had the sole right to conduct foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Former Rep. Jim Jones, an Oklahoma Democrat who has opposed Cheney on policy 
but admires him personally, said that his old rival has grown more partisan in 
the past couple of years. "I defend him," Jones said. "It's very hard to be a 
Republican in the House of Representatives. You're not in charge and never will 
be in charge. That's been hard for Cheney." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney admits that he dislikes the minority role. 
</P>
<P>
"You do not win by being a nice guy," Cheney said in a magazine interview last 
year. "The problem is that (the Democrats) run the House, and the minority can 
go along and get crumbs or we can be tough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good to Work For 
</P>
<P>
Cheney is tough, his staff acknowledges, but he is a pleasure to work for. He 
puts in long but not unreasonable hours. "He's not obsessive," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite three heart attacks in 10 years and quadruple bypass surgery last 
summer, his doctor has pronounced him fit for all activities. He skis, plays 
tennis, backpacks and rides horses for relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
He indulges in an occasional Budweiser but does not qualify as even a social 
drinker, friends say. He loves popcorn and enjoys cooking for his family and 
friends. When he can't prepare trout from the streams of northern Wyoming, he 
is often spied hanging around the fish counter at a supermarket in suburban 
McLean, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheneys have two daughters, Elizabeth, 22, who works in Washington at the 
Agency for International Development, and Mary, 20, a sophomore at Colorado 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho considers Cheney uniquely qualified, intellectually and temperamentally, 
for the demanding job of defense secretary. "He knows himself, he's not afraid 
of himself and he's not afraid to stand up for what he believes in," Coelho 
said. "I call that inner peace. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't agree at all on a lot of political and philosophical things; we're 
totally different politically. But he's the kind of guy you'd want as a friend. 
He won't turn his back on you. And that's very important in my business."

SHORTAGE OF FUNDS TO DELAY HIGHWAY PROJECTS IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in 15 years, state administrators have advised the 
California Transportation Commission that a shortage of highway funds will 
force them to begin a policy of intentionally delaying construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
In an internal memorandum from Transportation Department Director Robert K. 
Best, the commission was told to expect the first "slowdown" to come in July 
and then be followed by increasingly longer delays. 
</P>
<P>
After the July hiatus, the memo showed, the department would advertise projects 
for bid in August and September and then shut down again in October and 
November. By February, 1990, the memo said, all federal funds for that fiscal 
year will have been spent and new projects will have to be delayed five months 
until the following August. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kind of like the foreshocks to the earthquake," said Allan Hendrix, 
chief of the department's division of highways and programming. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials had warned for months that the five-year, $14-billion 
State Transportation Improvement Program faced at least a $3.5-billion deficit 
because gasoline tax and other highway user fees have not kept pace with 
inflation and demands for new construction. Legislative analysts later 
estimated the deficit at $4.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials had advised lawmakers that at some point they would have 
to begin juggling funds and delaying projects. The memo now provides the first 
firm indication of exactly when the department expects the delays to come and 
how long it expects each will last. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past several months, the department has identified for the commission 
an approaching slowdown in state highway construction, as our delivery of 
projects ready for advertising outpaces the availability of funds for these 
projects," Best wrote the commission. " . . . During the current federal fiscal 
year, we will deliver about $600 million of projects that exceed available 
funding." 
</P>
<P>
Best said the first delay might have come as soon as this month but officials 
were able to stave it off until July by "careful management of federal funds." 
</P>
<P>
"The department is attempting to stretch its money," said Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee. "At some 
point they are going to have to start laying off personnel and then gearing up 
again. We have been building up the department based on an expectation of funds 
and at some point you, don't need everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said it is too soon to name the specific projects that will be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
A department spokesman said some grading and paving work involved in the 
construction of the Century Freeway could be subject to a short delay, but he 
expects that contractors will be able to catch up quickly so the freeway could 
open on schedule in 1993. The 17.3-mile Century Freeway, constructed at a cost 
of $2 billion, will link the city of Norwalk with Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix said the money problems began in the mid-1980s with the passage of 
federal legislation and administrative rules that reduced the amount of federal 
money that was being poured into California for highway construction. He said 
state officials did not make a corresponding cutback in their planning for 
construction projects because they expected the federal losses to be made up by 
state funds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government provides 80% of the financing for most highway 
construction projects, with the states expected to pay the remaining 20%. 
</P>
<P>
When there was suddenly a shortage of state funds, Hendrix said, officials were 
forced to begin delaying projects. He said the first delay will come in July 
because federal funds for highway construction will be depleted in June. He 
said the department will be able to advertise projects for bid in August and 
September by, in effect, borrowing on anticipated federal funds which will 
become available in October. 
</P>
<P>
By October, he said the new funds will have been spent and the department will 
not be able to begin advertising again until December. At that point, he said, 
it can borrow against federal funds that will become available in January, 
1990. He said it expects those funds to be depleted by February. More will not 
be available, he said, until the following August. 
</P>
<P>
Although actual construction will be delayed, Hendrix said, engineering and 
designing will continue as if there is no shortage of funds. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the state intentionally ordered a slowdown on highway 
construction was in 1974, when state gas tax revenues "nose dived" as a result 
of the Arab oil embargo, Hendrix added. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for delaying projects came as lawmakers and private groups involved in 
transportation were preparing to meet with Gov. George Deukmejian in the next 
few weeks in a final effort to reach a compromise on the highway-financing 
issue. At two previous transportation "summits," Deukmejian, lawmakers and 
business and labor leaders agreed that an additional $20 billion will need to 
be pumped into the state's transportation system in the next decade to erase 
the deficit and to relieve traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of Californians for Better Transportation, a nonprofit group 
composed of business, labor and local government groups involved in 
transportation, said Wednesday they fear that the governor may push for a 
compromise that would provide only a portion of the $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
David Ackerman, legislative representative of the Associated General 
Contractors of California, said Deukmejian had agreed that $20 billion will be 
needed but insisted at the same time that any gas tax increase should be 
subject to voter approval. To raise $20 billion, he said, a substantial gas tax 
increase -- probably as much as 10 or 12 cents per gallon -- would be needed, 
and polls show that the voters would never approve such a hike. 
</P>
<P>
In private meetings, Ackerman said, officials in the Deukmejian Adminstration 
had broached the possibility of a 5-cent gas tax increase, which some polls 
show could win voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Maltester, president of Californians for Better Transportation, said his 
group, which is heavily represented at the summit meeting, could not agree to 
such a plan because it would provide little more than enough money to ease the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"There actually is a feeling of discouragement on the part of (Californians for 
Better Transportation) that really the summit is not producing anything," he 
said. " . . . If nothing comes out of the summit we're pretty well convinced 
nothing is going to happen during this Administration." 
</P>
<P>
But Kevin Brett, a spokesman for the governor, said Deukmejian is not wedded to 
any specific plan, although he remains firm in his contention that any proposed 
gas tax increase must be submitted to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"We remain confident that a consensus can be reached," he said. " . . . The 
process is right on schedule. We are pleased with the momentum so far but we go 
into this next meeting with our eyes fully open because we know the difficult 
issues still remain. This is not a simple subject."

JORDAN STUDENTS PASSIONATELY DEFEND SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seemed a perfect moment for the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his inimitable brand 
of crisis politics. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, a group of Watts parents had called a press conference to complain 
that students from one housing project were afraid to attend Jordan High 
School, fearing what would happen when they crossed turf claimed by street gang 
members. The complaint struck a media nerve, and Jordan High found itself cast 
as a symbol for youth violence infecting Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
So Jackson went to Jordan on Wednesday, ready to rouse what he assumed would be 
a sympathetic student body assembly with a suggestion that the National Guard 
be summoned, if necessary, to safeguard any student who wanted to get an 
education. 
</P>
<P>
But first the students had their say, and it changed everything. 
</P>
<P>
As Jackson listened, a 30-minute parade of angry, articulate Jordan students 
told an emotional, attentive audience of 1,400 classmates in the school gym 
that the real Jordan High is not a mirror image of the often-violent community 
that surrounds it. 
</P>
<P>
To frequent standing ovations, the young men and women declared themselves 
victims of mass-media stereotyping. They complained about a a Los Angeles 
Herald-Examiner editorial that compared Jordan to the notorious high school 
featured in the 1950s movie "Blackboard Jungle." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, said student Imelda Zambrano, Jordan is "a place where we achieve, we 
participate, we care." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abandons His Theme 
</P>
<P>
Clearly this was not the environment in which to evoke the image of National 
Guardsmen leading students into Jordan. So Jackson, who had listened with 
seeming delight to the students' indignant oratory, shelved the theme he had 
discussed at length before his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he stuck with his basic "I Am Somebody" speech, decorated with 
customary frills, like the good-natured interrogation of a Jordan High 
basketball player over how many hours he spent practicing for games versus 
examinations. 
</P>
<P>
It was, as always, an inspiring presentation. Yet, for one of the few times in 
his charismatic career, Jackson had been upstaged. The ovations he received 
fell markedly short of the intensity generated by student speakers, whose 
passionate addresses triggered not merely applause but the furious waving of 
many hand-lettered placards with phrases like, "Stop Exploiting Jordan," 
"Sensationalism Hurts," and "We Don't Dodge Bullets," a reference to the 
"Blackboard Jungle" editorial. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school board member Warren Furutani, whose district includes Watts, 
said student feelings were hurt because "people used (the complaint about some 
students being afraid to go to Jordan) to beat up the whole school, which was 
unfair." 
</P>
<P>
"We have been very hurt by this," added Leslie Lamont, a health teacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Original Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The complaints were first made Feb. 17 by residents of the Imperial Courts 
housing project, who said tension between one gang of Crips in Imperial Courts 
and a rival Crips gang in the Jordan Downs project next to the high school had 
made it unsafe for Imperial Courts residents to walk to school. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said the allegations were overstated and dismissed them as a 
personal vendetta against Jordan by one of the protest leaders, Ezola Foster, a 
former Jordan teacher who is an officer in a politically conservative group 
called the American Assn. of Women. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Tomlinson, a dean of students at Jordan, said in an interview 
Wednesday that of the estimated 150 Imperial Courts residents who attend 
Jordan, the only ones affected by gang tension were two dozen members of their 
project's gang who brought problems on themselves by "throwing" gang signs on 
their way to and from school. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials said on March 2 that any Imperial Courts students who 
wanted to transfer to other schools would be permitted to do so. 
</P>
<P>
It was against this backdrop that student body leaders at Jordan High began 
planning two weeks ago to stage a rally to boost confidence among students and 
to dedicate a "Bulldog Pride" mural in the lunch area. It was coincidence that 
Jackson, in town to tape television appearances on a talk show and network 
comedy, requested permission to visit Jordan, where he had spoken several times 
in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
From the first student speaker, Jordan's student body -- now almost two-thirds 
Latino compared to one-third black as a result of an attendance area that has 
expanded east toward South Gate -- exploded in righteousness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Activities 
</P>
<P>
"You never hear about those of us who strive to make a difference," said 
Ulunder Martin, referring to a wide variety of student clubs and counseling 
programs. "People only are told about those who have given up on themselves." 
Students are, in effect, "guilty until proven innocent." 
</P>
<P>
"The school is not responsible for the community. . . . We take pride in our 
school," said Trenetta Newman, slamming her hand angrily on the podium as she 
finished her remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not only surviving, we're striving for the best," said Student Body 
President Ivin Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
Added Furutani, shouting so loud that his voice cracked, "Some people think in 
order to teach young people like yourselves you need a baseball bat or a 
bullhorn. You don't need that at Jordan High School." 
</P>
<P>
When Jackson finally took the microphone, he challenged students to overcome 
the adversity they had decried. 
</P>
<P>
"You want a better record from the media?" he said. "Let the academic exams 
come out and have Jordan be in the top 10 . . . that's how you do it." Jordan 
achievement scores are generally near the bottom among district high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The energy of the rally, Jackson said, was "like resurrection. It's new hope. 
Don't you surrender. You can be what you want to be. Let those who 
underestimate you challenge you. Bring them on!" 
</P>
<P>
Jackson asked everyone in the audience who was 17 or 18 and not registered to 
vote to come forward to the speaker's platform and take a voter registration 
card. Scores did. He asked everyone who wanted to pray for a friend to get off 
drugs, or to get rid of a weapon, to come forward to say a prayer for peace. 
Scores more did. Then Jackson introduced singer Mel Carter, who performed a 
gospel song. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to reflect, not just react," Jackson told the students.

APPLE REMOVAL SPREADS TO FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dade County Public Schools in Florida, the nation's fourth-largest school 
district, on Wednesday joined a growing list of school systems across the 
nation that have banished apples and related products from lunch menus because 
of fear of daminozide, a chemical used to treat some apple crops. 
</P>
<P>
It follows New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and scores of smaller districts 
that have removed apples, apple juice and apple sauce from school cafeterias 
and vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, 54 out of 82 districts as of Wednesday had stopped 
serving fresh apples and products made from them. 
</P>
<P>
However, at least two local districts -- San Marino and Antelope Valley Union 
-- said they have decided to return apples to school menus today after 
consulting outside experts and vendors, who told them that daminozide levels 
are not harmful or were not found in the products they use. 
</P>
<P>
In other districts, such as Culver City, Newhall Elementary and El Monte Union 
High School District, officials said they were still serving apple juice, 
because they were convinced that it did not contain daminozide in dangerous 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Most districts said they are refraining from serving fresh apples and apple 
products until they receive official word from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and the state Department of Education that doing so would not pose 
a health risk to children. State Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer on 
Tuesday said districts were overreacting by not serving the fruit to students. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hastings, food and nutrition director for Dade County schools, which 
provides 163,000 lunches a day, said: "When New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Los 
Angeles made the decision (to stop serving apples), we decided maybe we better 
do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
He said Dade -- which includes Miami's schools -- would continue the ban "until 
we get some answer from a regulatory agency one way or another" about the 
safety of apples treated with daminozide, which has been linked to cancer in 
laboratory studies using rats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back in Schools 
</P>
<P>
However, officials in the San Marino Unified School District, after receiving 
verification from suppliers that their products do not contain the chemical, 
decided Wednesday that it was safe to start serving apples and apple products 
again, Food Service Director Susan Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, students in the Newhall Elementary School District, who have not been 
offered any apples since Monday, will also start seeing the fruit again today, 
according to Food Services Director Terry Custer. 
</P>
<P>
Custer said he consulted the USDA and the Toxic Information Center, a San 
Francisco-based group funded by the state Department of Health Services, and is 
now convinced that it is "better to eat the apples than not eat them. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied now . . . that the whole thing has been blown slightly out of 
proportion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Newhall, Child Nutrition Director Geri Dee said the district's five schools 
have continued to serve apple juice on demand to students who, for health or 
other reasons, do not drink milk. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to this article were researchers Tracy Thomas and Shawn Griggs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
APPLE BAN

daminozide.

YOUNG PEOPLE READ, BUT PAPERS AREN'T NO. 1 CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young people don't read much anymore because television has made them too 
passive to do anything as demanding as reading. Or is it that computers and 
video games have made them too active to do anything as undemanding as reading? 
</P>
<P>
So go two schools of conventional wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the conventional wisdom is more conventional than wise. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, a young reader's attention span may be shorter now because of television; 
yes, today's young readers respond better to a more visually exciting 
presentation of information and entertainment, preferably one in which they can 
actively participate; yes, today's youth are accustomed to being able to pick 
and choose from among small, accessible bits of information rather than having 
to wade through long stories. 
</P>
<P>
But today's young people do read. It's just that they read magazines 
(particularly specialty magazines geared to their interests) and books 
(especially fiction) far more than they read newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Library circulation of juvenile books increased 33% from 1980 to 1987, for 
example, compared to only 8% for adult books, according to a study by the 
Library Research Center at the University of Illinois. Sales of juvenile trade 
books rose 250% from 1972 to 1986. Such authors of adult fiction as Douglas 
Adams, Stephen King, Clive Barker and Danielle Steele all have large youth 
followings. 
</P>
<P>
The young read both escapist literature and, in magazines and newspapers, those 
stories and publications that have an impact on their daily lives and that 
speak to them in their language. Studies show that those aged 18-to-24 and 
25-to-34 are far more likely than people in older age groups to exercise, play 
sports, go skiing, camping or backpacking, go to a movie, a sporting event, a 
play or a concert. Not surprisingly, they want to read about those activities, 
too. The median age of readers of such magazines as Ski, World Tennis, Car and 
Driver, Rolling Stone, Seventeen, Mademoiselle and GQ is in the mid-to-late-20s 
-- 10 to 15 years younger than that for daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to one survey, people aged 18 to 34 account for 20% more 
than their proportionate share of total magazine readership, and they buy more 
than double their share of paperback books and 40% more than their share of 
hardcover books. 
</P>
<P>
There is also some indication that the more the young watch television, the 
more likely, not less likely, they are to read newspapers. The two media are 
often mutually reinforcing, not just competitive. When a strike closed all New 
York newspapers in 1978, for instance, the audience for television news shows 
in New York dropped noticeably; only when the newspapers resumed publishing did 
audiences return to pre-strike levels. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one can argue that today's younger readers -- "the best-educated 
generation in history and perhaps the most cosmopolitan, precocious and 
independent-minded," in the words of one study -- are an ideal audience for the 
daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
So why, apart from life style changes, is newspaper readership among the young 
-- children, teen-agers, people in their 20s -- at an all-time low? Is it just 
a matter of their having no interest in anything that doesn't affect them 
directly and of their only being attracted to the flashy and the superficial? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't blackball a whole generation as a trivial group of people," said 
Jennie Buckner, a managing editor at the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner argues that editors shouldn't think that long stories automatically 
discourage young readers and that newspapers can attract the young only with 
short stories that don't tax their attention span or distract them too long 
from their strictly personal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're interested in the topic, they will read . . . long pieces on it," 
she said. "We have to package it better, make it easier to get through . . . 
show more discrimination . . . just better damn quality." Specifically, she 
said, young readers want more sophisticated consumer reporting and aggressive 
investigative reporting because they "don't trust official sources." 
</P>
<P>
Christine D. Urban, president of Urban &amp; Associates Inc., a market research 
and consulting company that specializes in newspapers, said surveys show that 
young people have essentially the same interests as older readers, except for 
local news. "They're just as interested in national and international (news) 
and . . . sports and . . . business, the same kinds of things that have 
traditionally been the foundation of a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Barrier to Entry' 
</P>
<P>
The "barrier to entry" that newspapers pose for young readers seems to be much 
more format and style than content, Urban said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, she said, the young seem acutely sensitive to the pressures of 
time, and they find it "a lot more efficient" to do two things simultaneously 
-- driving a car and listening to all-news radio. A "single-dimensional 
activity" like sitting down to read a newspaper "seems like a phenomenal waste 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
But neither Urban nor any editors claim to have discovered how to overcome this 
problem and reach young readers. 
</P>
<P>
It's not for want of trying. 
</P>
<P>
Many papers without Sunday editions have been adding them -- theorizing that 
young people, in particular, will be attracted. A 1987 survey for the Newspaper 
Advertising Bureau showed that if readers were forced to choose between reading 
a Sunday paper or reading a paper the other six days a week, more than half the 
18-to-24-year-olds said they would rather have the Sunday paper. In every other 
age group, the daily paper was preferred, and that preference increased as age 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
What are papers that already have Sunday editions doing to attract the young? 
The Chicago Tribune publishes a weekly Style section aimed at young women and 
also provides special supplements for students, distributed with the paper in 
schools. The St. Louis Post Dispatch publishes a weekly, staff-written column 
based on discussions of teen-agers' problems by a "peer panel" of high school 
students, responding to letters from other high school students. The Boston 
Globe is publishing a continuing series on math and science instruction in the 
local schools and a weekly "Learning" page; the paper has also added a teen 
column, increased its coverage of pop culture and added a weekly, full-color, 
youth-oriented ArtsEtc. section. 
</P>
<P>
Even the New York Times, long a bastion of journalistic traditionalism, has 
added new life-style sections and columns on fitness, child-rearing and 
participatory sports, among other subjects of interest to younger readers. The 
New York Times also added pages on health and education and expanded its 
coverage of pop music and added a page on children's programming to its weekly 
television guide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Is This for Me?' 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to provide what Executive Editor Max Frankel calls "multiple entry 
points on every page so that the scanner, the person in a hurry, can decide 
very quickly, 'Is this for me or is it not?' " the New York Times now labels 
many pages ("International," "National," "The Living Arts") and stories 
("Review/Dance," "Suburban Journal"). 
</P>
<P>
These changes are not designed exclusively for young readers, of course, but 
they do enable readers to save time and to easily find only what interests them 
-- two special concerns of the young. Moreover, Frankel said the paper is also 
planning to make its Sunday magazine more "hip . . . with it" and to publish 
more reports on campus life, street fashions and young designers as part of an 
overall effort to become more "reader friendly." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be important in people's lives," Frankel said. "They've got to 
need us, and once we get them hooked -- and preferably if we get them hooked 
early enough -- then it will be a lifelong habit that they have to at least 
look at us every day." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, at a time when many newspapers are pushing the use of newspapers in 
the classroom as one of the best ways to begin the newspaper habit among the 
young, the New York Times has largely moved away from such programs at the 
elementary and secondary school level, according to Lance Primis, president of 
the paper. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times pioneered the development of teaching tools for using 
newspapers in the classroom in 1932, and by the late 1960s sales through the 
paper's College and School Services accounted for 18% of total Times 
circulation. But in the 1980s, cost-cutting and advertisers' diminished 
interest in the young audience prompted the Times to greatly reduce those 
programs. The paper no longer provides teaching materials to schools (although 
it does sell papers to the schools and, two years ago, renewed its college 
sales program). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Regarded Program 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Los Angeles Times didn't start an official Newspaper in 
Education program until relatively late -- 1985 -- but it now has what is 
widely regarded as one of the eight or 10 best such programs in the country. 
Last year, The Times trained more than 1,000 teachers to use the newspaper as a 
classroom tool. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from this program, though, the Los Angeles Times has probably made fewer 
changes to try to attract younger readers than almost any other major newspaper 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has added color and shortened many stories, and it does provide a 
weekly review of books for young adults and extensive coverage of rock music, 
movies and television, and the paper's suburban sections do emphasize local 
news and sports -- all steps that surveys say can attract younger readers, even 
if that is not always their primary purpose. But The Times still publishes many 
long stories (like this one), and the paper has not done much specifically 
designed to attract young readers, the one demographic group whose wholesale 
defection in recent years has alarmed newspaper editors from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of priorities," said William F. Thomas, editor of The Times from 
1971 until his retirement this year. "There's not enough room in the paper for 
all the things we want to present to people who need and want more broadly 
based information." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he has never seen "convincing proof" that attempts to woo younger 
readers "paid off in later newspaper readership." Nor, he said, did he "see any 
sense in tailoring any part of the paper . . . (in a way that) clashed with its 
basic personality." Even The Times' comics pages are aimed at adults, not 
children, Thomas said. "I didn't want the comics pages to be out of character 
either." 
</P>
<P>
But for many young people, comics have traditionally been the point of entry 
into a newspaper, and while television cartoon shows may have diminished their 
appeal somewhat, studies continue to show that comics are the favorite 
newspaper feature of most very young readers. 
</P>
<P>
At 42, Shelby Coffey III, who replaced Thomas as editor, is 22 years younger 
than Thomas -- but he agrees with his predecessor that a newspaper should 
remain true to its traditions and make no radical changes to accommodate 
specific audiences. Readers tend to become comfortable with their newspapers; 
radical change discomfits and alienates them. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has, however, been experimenting with a few possible approaches to 
youth in its Orange County edition -- a weekend entertainment guide, a weekly, 
full-page forum for (and largely by) high school students and a weekly news 
quiz. 
</P>
<P>
These experiments (and a few others) were launched in Orange County largely 
because of competitive pressure from the Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
The Register has aggressively sought younger readers. The paper publishes 
essays by young readers and offers a Family section every Thursday (including a 
serialized story for children aged 10 to 13). The Register also publishes some 
of the best color in any American newspaper, includes a special youth 
supplement, Young American, once a month and has a Friday entertainment section 
that is extremely popular with readers. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of youth readership affects newspapers of all sizes, and many other 
medium-sized -- and smaller -- papers are also trying a wide variety of tactics 
in an effort to address that problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Helena (Mont.) Independent Record (circulation 13,000) and Bismarck (N.D.) 
Tribune (circ. 29,000) have both started weekly tabloid sections for teen-age 
readers. The San Francisco Examiner (circ. 144,000) has hired three critics 
under 30 -- for rock music, television and the theater. The Sacramento Bee 
(circ. 250,000) uses special, youth-oriented radio advertisements on local rock 
music stations. 
</P>
<P>
James D. Squires, editor of the Chicago Tribune, thinks smaller papers have an 
advantage over large metropolitan dailies in the pursuit of young readers. 
</P>
<P>
"The young audience that we're trying to get is now much more likely to be 
grabbed by a local newspaper that deals with its community news," Squires said. 
"That lowest level of governmental jurisdiction, which taxes them and which 
causes them problems -- they want to know about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest in Local News 
</P>
<P>
But studies show that most young people are not very interested in local news, 
the traditional franchise of all newspapers -- especially smaller papers -- and 
that gives smaller papers both a special challenge and a special opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Not all editors think covering local government is the best way to meet that 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I have diverted one hell of a lot of resources that used to be on government 
beats to areas like sports and entertainment to go where the audience is," said 
Michael Lloyd, editor of the Grand Rapids (Mich.) Press (circ. 138,000). "Going 
to the shopping mall is an entertainment. We deliberately run, once a week, a 
list of all the events happening at the shopping malls, whether it's a blood 
donor deal or a gingerbread-house (building) competition . . . home improvement 
fairs, craft fairs." 
</P>
<P>
Many small and medium-size papers also use Newspaper in Education programs as 
the keystone of their efforts to attract young readers, for now and for future 
generations. Programs at the Biloxi (Miss.) Sun Herald, Cedar Rapids (Iowa) 
Gazette, Jacksonville (Fla.) Journal and The State in Columbia, S.C., are 
generally regarded as among the best in the country (along with those at such 
larger papers as the Philadelphia Inquirer, USA Today, Los Angeles Times, 
Chicago Tribune, Detroit Free Press, Minneapolis Star Tribune and St. Louis 
Post Dispatch). 
</P>
<P>
It's no coincidence that four of these papers are owned by Knight Ridder, which 
is in the forefront of those trying to solve the problem of attracting young 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still just at the top of the first inning in even thinking about how to 
attack it," said James Batten, president and chief executive officer of Knight 
Ridder. "Cosmetic touches, which a lot of papers -- including some of ours -- 
have done don't really go at the heart of this question. This is a demographic 
group that's different in all kinds of ways from those that went before, and I 
think that we have to understand them better than we do and really be wide open 
to approaches that may be radically different from what we've done before. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who is not actively concerned about (young readers) . . . is living in 
a dream world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very High Priority' 
</P>
<P>
Knight Ridder is giving the problem of young readers "very high priority," 
Batten said. He has just appointed Lou Heldman, deputy managing editor of the 
Miami Herald, to take charge of a youth readership project full time, with help 
from one other full-time staffer and several others working half time, all 
looking for fresh approaches to attracting young readers. 
</P>
<P>
"No idea is too crazy to be off limits," Batten said. 
</P>
<P>
For those editors who worry that trying to attract young readers might 
undermine a paper's basic mission, it's worth noting that Knight Ridder 
newspapers have won more Pulitzer Prizes than any other papers in recent years 
-- 22 in the last four years alone. 
</P>
<P>
Like its sister Knight Ridder paper in San Jose, the Philadelphia Inquirer -- 
winner of seven Pulitzer Prizes in the last four years -- has already 
instituted new appeals to youth. For the very young, the Inquirer redesigned 
its Sunday funnies to include a strip on celebrities of interest to teen-agers 
and "The Mini Page," an assortment of stories, puzzles, illustrations and 
quizzes aimed at the 6-to-12-year-old audience and created by Betty Debnam, a 
former schoolteacher in Washington, D.C. ("The Mini Page" is syndicated to 
about 450 papers nationwide, including more than half a dozen in the Los 
Angeles area.) 
</P>
<P>
Every Friday in a special edition distributed to Philadelphia schools, the 
Inquirer prints a full page of activities, "For Students Today," referring them 
to specific stories in that day's paper to learn about math, science, social 
studies, language arts and other subjects. Philadelphia teachers can also call 
a toll-free number at the Inquirer to reach "Lesson Line," which provides 
guidance for using Inquirer stories as teaching tools. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Berman, who is in charge of the paper's Newspaper in Education program, 
also supervises the production of monthly, 16-page, tabloid supplements on such 
issues as human rights, ethnic images, architecture and children's literature. 
The supplements are distributed to Philadelphia schoolchildren and sold to more 
than 100 other newspapers around the country for use in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Free Press, another Knight Ridder paper, also creates special 
monthly supplements for the schools on such subjects as elections, building 
self-esteem, the arts, black women and state history. But the paper's most 
innovative project is its high school journalism program, begun in 1985 and 
financed in part by local corporate sponsors. Journalism students come to the 
Free Press and, working with a Free Press editor, they write, edit and lay out 
their own school paper -- which is actually printed as a full page in special 
editions of the Free Press. Nineteen schools participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
The students are mostly members of minority groups, so "by including high 
school newspapers in special Free Press editions, we have made our newspaper 
more relevant to this group and more likely to be used," the paper says. 
</P>
<P>
In cities like Detroit, with large minority populations, newspaper readership 
is a particularly acute problem; many members of minority groups are less well 
educated than most Anglos, and many immigrants do not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics suggest that the problem of attracting young newspaper readers could 
get worse, in part because of these conditions. According to a study by 
American Demographics magazine, minorities -- primarily blacks, Latinos and 
Asian-Americans -- will account for 87% of all U.S. population growth over the 
next decade; the median age of members of minority groups is considerably 
younger than that of non-minorities and birth rates in some minority groups are 
generally higher than for Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem of declining readership among the young ultimately cuts across 
all ethnic lines -- and most geographic lines as well. It may be somewhat less 
acute in the Northeast, where one survey showed 54% daily readership in the 
21-to-25 age group (compared with 45% in the West and Midwest and 36% in the 
Southeast), but editors everywhere are worried about the loss of young readers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of alternatives out there that are providing information that 
seems to fill some of their needs," said Gregory Favre, executive editor of the 
Sacramento Bee and chairman of the readership committee of the American Society 
of Newspaper Editors. "Perhaps we're not putting out a newspaper that younger 
people want to read."

Tom Lutgen of The Times editorial library assisted with the research for this 
story.

DIFFERENCES AMONG YOUNG READERS 
</P>
<P>
 Figures from National Assessment of Education Progress studies indicate that 
newspaper reading habits among readers aged 21-25 vary by region and education.

'THOREAU OF THE AMERICAN WEST,' EDWARD ABBEY, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edward Abbey, the irreverent writer and impassioned environmentalist whose 
popular books perpetuated their author's dream of seeing "the whole American 
West made into a wilderness," has died in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
The man dubbed "the Thoreau of the American West" by "Lonesome Dove" author 
Larry McMurtry died Tuesday at his home at age 62 of internal bleeding caused 
by a circulatory disorder, said Jack Macrae, a friend who also is 
editor-in-chief of Henry Holt &amp; Co., Abbey's publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Abbey recently had completed a draft of "Hayduke Lives," a sequel to his 
best-known book, "The Monkey Wrench Gang," which told of a group of 
environmentalists plotting to blow up Arizona's Glen Canyon Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of paperback copies of "The Monkey Wrench Gang" were sold 
after its publication in 1976, making Abbey a sort of underground hero to the 
burgeoning environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
His writings have been credited by founders of the hard-line environmental 
group Earth First! with providing the underpinnings of their philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Hayduke Lives" would be the 20th book by the one-time park ranger, firefighter 
and political radical. 
</P>
<P>
The renegade outdoorsman once said there was nothing wrong with throwing beer 
cans out car windows, since paved roads were abominations and unworthy of 
respect. He had grown to hate the survey stakes, aircraft and golf courses that 
marred his once-pristine desert landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Anthologies refer to him as "irascible," "cantankerous," "iconoclastic" and 
"crusty." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey himself resisted simple summations, even those calling him 
environmentalist or naturalist. "If a label is required," he once wrote, "say 
that I am one who loves the unfenced country." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that he found himself "getting more radical as I get older," 
as he told The Times last year, he was not without a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Outside magazine asked Abbey for an almanac of the high and low 
points of the 1975-85 decade. 
</P>
<P>
Under "Low Point" he wrote: "Beef ranchers in Montana and Wyoming harvest 155 
'troublesome' grizzlies." 
</P>
<P>
The "High Point" read: "Grizzlies in Montana and Wyoming harvest 22 
'troublesome' tourists." 
</P>
<P>
In "One Life at a Time Please" he offered essays guaranteed to offend everyone 
he touched. Cattlemen were "nothing more than Western parasites." Recent 
arrivals to the West were "instant rednecks." 
</P>
<P>
But Abbey represented far more than the wise-cracking, one-time farm boy he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
In a review of "Desert Solitaire," Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edwin Way 
Teale noted that Abbey's work as a park ranger had brought him to the 
wilderness before the invasion of "the parked trailers, their windows blue 
tinged at night while the inmates, instead of watching the desert stars, watch 
TV and listen to the canned laughter of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
He called Abbey "a voice crying in the wilderness, for the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey was born on a small farm in Appalachia and, after a stint in the Army, 
hitchhiked West in 1946. He studied English and philosophy at the University of 
New Mexico and turned to writing while supporting himself at odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He worked off and on for both the National Park Service and the Forest Service 
as a road inspector, auto assembly line worker and ditch digger. 
</P>
<P>
"I pounded survey stakes before I ever got the notion to pull them out," he 
told The Times in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although he became a champion of the outdoors, he was not one to rhapsodize its 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
He faulted writers "gushing about finding God in every bush."

NICARAGUA LIFTS BAN ON NEWS ON CATHOLIC STATION

<P>
The government on Wednesday lifted an eight-month-old ban on news broadcasts by 
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic radio station, the only news medium still affected 
by last year's sweeping Sandinista crackdown on dissent. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega announced the measure after meeting with Cardinal 
Miguel Obando y Bravo, the country's senior prelate. Ortega said it is meant to 
"create a better climate in our country for strengthening the trend toward a 
total and definitive peace" with the U.S.-backed Contras. 
</P>
<P>
He also authorized the return of 10 foreign priests who were expelled from 
Nicaragua in recent years and the reopening of the Catholic Social Promotion 
Commission, which was closed in 1985 for publishing a bulletin of news and 
political commentary without government permission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Intentions a Concern 
</P>
<P>
The moves to ease censorship come as the Bush Administration is preparing to 
ask Congress for at least $45 million in non-military aid to keep the rebel 
army together in Honduran base camps for another year. Ortega said Wednesday 
that he is "concerned" about the Administration's intentions because they "go 
against" a peace agreement signed by the five Central American presidents last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the countries of the region are to devise a plan by mid-May 
to close the rebel camps in Honduras, and Nicaragua is to take steps to 
guarantee open and fair elections by next February. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials said Ortega is preparing a proposal for reforming the laws 
that regulate elections and the news media and will unveil them to opposition 
parties Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders have demanded that the government abolish its censorship 
powers. After peace talks with the Contras broke down last June, the government 
used those powers in a wide-ranging crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic Radio was ordered off the air July 11 for its on-the-scene reporting 
of a violent clash between riot police and anti-Sandinista demonstrators. It 
was allowed back on the air five weeks later, but only for religious 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Carballo, general manager of the station, said it will resume news 
broadcasts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Obando, an outspoken critic of Sandinista rule, said after meeting 
Ortega that he is "pleased that rough spots between the church and state are 
being smoothed out." But he refused to join Ortega in opposing further 
non-lethal U.S. aid to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the rebel army has been mostly idled in its camps since the 
suspension of U.S. military aid a year ago, Obando said: "I told the president 
that if he keeps taking steps toward democratization, any new aid to the 
Contras will oblige them to stay in Honduras playing volleyball and baseball."

BAKER'S AID REQUEST FOR CONTRAS IS SLOWED BY HOUSE DEMOCRATS 
</P>

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's request for new non-military aid for 
Nicaragua's Contras ran into opposition Wednesday from House Democrats, who 
said they need more time to study his proposals for U.S. diplomacy in Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' misgivings appear likely to force President Bush to postpone a 
public announcement of his new Central America policy, which officials said 
they had hoped would take place as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed policy would combine U.S. diplomatic support for a Central 
American peace plan with increased pressure on Nicaragua's Sandinista 
government to enact democratic reforms -- plus an estimated $50 million to keep 
the Contras alive until Nicaragua conducts elections next February. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, seeking bipartisan support for his plan, won general backing from the 
leaders of both parties in the House and Senate last week. But liberal 
Democrats in the House marshaled opposition to the plan this week, prompting 
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) to tell Baker on Wednesday that they want more time to consider the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to discuss the matter," Mitchell said through a spokesman. 
"Progress is being made." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official expressed frustration with the Democrats' 
stand. "They never get together up there on anything having to do with Central 
America," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Administration wants to launch the policy with clear 
bipartisan support. "Our view is that we've given them . . . an offer they 
can't refuse," he said. "But maybe they'll refuse it anyway, in which event we 
probably have to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
At a closed-door meeting Tuesday, a majority of House Democrats decided that 
they are unhappy with Baker's request for renewed non-military aid to the 
Contras until the Nicaraguan elections. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's aid intended to resettle the Contras, we have always envisaged that," 
said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). "If it's some kind of 
incentive to keep the Contras going, that's a completely different issue. . . . 
I don't think we should support it until we see some more specifics." 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official said that Baker still hopes some kind of compromise 
can be worked out this week. "There are still a few issues to resolve, but 
consultations are ongoing," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to one House Democratic leader said that the issues include assurances 
that the money will not be used to put the Contras in an improved position to 
resume military operations if the peace plan falters. Baker already has said 
publicly that the Administration will warn the Contras to halt military 
operations against Nicaragua from their camps in neighboring Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking the military equation . . . out of it," a senior Administration 
official said. "We are talking about keeping the resistance there as an 
incentive to encourage the Sandinistas to do what they promised they were going 
to do" in internal reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Administration wants to postpone any moves to disband the 
Contras until after the Nicaraguan election next February. Officials in 
Honduras, where the rebels are based, have said that they want the Contras 
resettled by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Central American peace plan, adopted by five of the area's nations last 
month, calls for a formula to demobilize and resettle the Contras by May 15, 
but sets no deadline for the resettlement process itself. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a free and fair election in February, we'd have to look at measures 
for repatriation," the senior Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how likely prospects are for a fair election, he indicated that he is 
skeptical. "They haven't performed yet, have they?" he said of the Sandinista 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"The Contras are an incentive," he said. "Not as big an incentive as if they 
were sitting there with a lot of weapons . . . but it is an incentive. And we 
have not had performance by the Sandinistas; there's been anything but 
performance. So whatever incentives we have, we should maintain." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the greatest need is for a coherent U.S. policy with broad 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have now is . . . a chaotic situation," he said. "You have Central 
American government (officials) coming to town and meeting with (congressional) 
staffers and not meeting with the executive branch and cutting deals with the 
Hill. You can't run a foreign policy like that."

GORBACHEV URGES 'LAND FOR PEASANTS' IN SWEEPING REFORM OF AGRICULTURE 
</P>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in one of his most far-reaching reforms 
yet, Wednesday detailed a complete reorganization of the country's 
state-managed agricultural system, which has proven increasingly incapable of 
feeding the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Urging the return of "land to the peasants" after nearly 60 years of 
collectivized agriculture, Gorbachev called for a new, highly decentralized 
system encouraging the country's 25 million farmers to work in small 
cooperatives and even independently in an effort to increase harvests. 
</P>
<P>
Food shortages, which have been chronic for so long in the Soviet Union, are 
now the country's most pressing political and social as well as economic 
problem, Gorbachev told a special meeting of the Communist Party's 
policy-making Central Committee. Further delay puts the whole reform effort and 
even the country's stability at risk, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2-Hour Address 
</P>
<P>
"We still lag behind the developed countries, both large and small, in the 
productivity of labor in agriculture, in the yield of our harvests, in 
livestock productivity and in the diversity and quality of food products," 
Gorbachev said in a two-hour address, which was broadcast later on national 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"The gap, rather than narrowing, is growing wider. The food shortages create 
social tension, and they are generating not just criticism but actual 
discontent." he said. 
</P>
<P>
The "food problem," as the increasingly severe food shortage is called here, is 
now "our society's biggest wound," Gorbachev said, declaring that its solution 
has become "the main direction of our entire political course, an organic part 
of revolutionary perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
Although the immediate intention is "to restore the farmer as the master on the 
land and, once and for all, solve the food problem," as Gorbachev told the 
party meeting, the proposals will require such fundamental changes in the 
country's whole economic system as to amount to a redefinition of Soviet 
socialism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laying the Foundation 
</P>
<P>
Such basic economic concepts as private ownership, market forces, competition, 
capital formation, entrepreneurship and central planning will all need to be 
rethought, Gorbachev acknowledged, for the steps taken in agriculture will have 
a wide impact -- and are intended, in fact, to lay the foundation for much 
broader measures. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he acknowledged, the proposals have encountered widespread 
opposition from those wanting to improve but preserve the present system and 
from others who see a serious threat to socialism as a result of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
He resolutely rejected such conservative criticism, virtually quoting recent 
speeches by Yegor K. Ligachev, the party secretary in charge of agriculture. 
But he also declared his intention to preserve the overall framework of state 
and collective farms as the reforms proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Debate today by the 300 members of the Central Committee and other participants 
in the two-day meeting will be intense, according to informed Soviet officials, 
but the final resolution, already the result of more than a year of 
experimentation, discussion and compromise, is likely to win firm approval and 
become a key element of perestroika, or restructuring, as Gorbachev's reforms 
are known. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of Gorbachev's proposal is to lease the land, the livestock, the 
equipment and most of the other productive assets of the Soviet Union's 49,200 
state and collective farms and 7,600 other agricultural enterprises to groups 
of farmers or workers and even to families and individuals on the basis of 
negotiated contracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 50 Years 
</P>
<P>
These contracts, which could run for as long as 50 years, with a son inheriting 
the land his father had leased, will require rental payments and initially 
delivery of specified amounts of produce. But they will free farmers from the 
day-to-day supervision of the multi-layered bureaucracy that now administers 
Soviet agriculture and permit them to sell on the open market whatever they 
produce beyond the contracted amounts. 
</P>
<P>
"The point here is to transfer the land and other means of production to 
lease-holders and to give them real control over these means," said Gorbachev, 
himself the son of a southern Russian peasant. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, from next January, will also receive significantly higher payments for 
the produce they sell to the state as a further spur to increase their output, 
and they have been promised more and better quality farming equipment at lower 
prices as well as easier and cheaper bank credits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Broad Opportunities' 
</P>
<P>
"The essence of economic change in the countryside should be in granting 
farmers broad opportunities for displaying independence, enterprise and 
initiative," Gorbachev said. "We should resolutely overcome the alienation of 
rural workers -- and, by the way, of all working people -- from property that 
belongs to them in name only." 
</P>
<P>
In a major step toward that goal, Gorbachev proposed disbanding of the State 
Agro-Industrial Committee, a super-ministry that he formed in November, 1985, 
in an earlier attempt at agricultural reform. 
</P>
<P>
Taking its place would be a state commission to coordinate purchases of 
agricultural produce, still necessary to ensure fair distribution of food at 
stable prices around the country, and decentralized regional bodies whose 
mission would be to support, rather than supervise, the farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the government hopes that the measures will increase farm output 
by 16% during the five-year plan that begins in 1991 and with improved 
transport and processing that the production of foodstuffs would grow by 26% to 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
Even in years with good harvests -- grain production dropped nearly 8% to 195 
million tons last year -- the Soviet Union cannot feed its 285 million people 
without extensive imports of wheat, corn, meat, vegetable oil, fruits, sugar, 
vegetables and other food products. 
</P>
<P>
But declining oil prices have reduced by almost a third over the past seven 
years Moscow's ability to make up its food deficit with imports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intervention Cited 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev traced the origin of the problem to the forced collectivization of 
agriculture in the late 1920s and early 1930s under the dictator Josef Stalin, 
who adopted policies that the founders of Marxism had warned would be ruinous 
for socialism. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet political system was seen in its "ugliest form in the forcible 
methods, accelerated pace of complete collectivization and the (arbitrary) 
intervention in the processes of production, of exchange and distribution," 
Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
"The individual's aspiration to be a master on his own land, the aspiration 
that had been legislatively recognized, was declared to be a leftover of the 
private-owner mentality. . . . . Any economic independence of collective and 
state farms was ruled out, and their members were put in the position of day 
laborers." 
</P>
<P>
The problems were compounded over the years despite several attempts after 
Josef Stalin's death in 1953 to reform the system, Gorbachev said, offering an 
extensive review intended to justify his radical proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stranger to Farming 
</P>
<P>
"A new agrarian policy, which the countryside so needed, has never been 
elaborated," he said, though his first Kremlin job was as the Central Committee 
secretary in charge of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, under considerable pressure not to abandon the system of state 
and collective farms and to cushion the impact that the reforms will have on 
their workers, said the party's goal would be to develop "the huge potential 
inherent in the collective system" through innovative policies.

GORBACHEV CRITICIZED BUT WINS PARLIAMENT SEAT

Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet president, won election as a Communist Party 
deputy to the country's new parliament Wednesday but not before three party 
members had questioned his suitability for office. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of glasnost, the policy of political openness instituted by 
Gorbachev, the three had written the party's policy-making Central Committee 
arguing that he must also accept responsibility for the country's problems 
since he was a member of the leadership in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which is holding a two-day meeting on agricultural policy, 
nevertheless voted for Gorbachev and all 99 other candidates who were nominated 
two months ago. None was opposed, according to reports by the official Soviet 
news agency Tass, and all received the approval of at least half of the 
participants in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But Valentin A. Koptyug, chairman of the party's electoral commission, said 
that several of the top party leaders were criticized during the election 
process, a contrast to the past practice of unquestioning acceptance of such 
Central Committee decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The most criticized apparently was Yegor K. Ligachev, Central Committee 
secretary in charge of agriculture and voice of conservatism within the ruling 
Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Koptyug said the commission received 25 letters criticizing Ligachev, 
particularly his cautious approach to political and economic reform and his 
scathing denunciation of Boris N. Yeltsin, a popular former member of the 
Politburo, last summer at a party conference. 
</P>
<P>
The elections have been a valuable political process for the party, encouraging 
discussion of both its policies and leaders, Koptyug said in outlining the 
criticism the top leaders received. Altogether, more than 12,000 letters, 
telegrams and resolutions have been received from party organizations and 
members commenting on the party's candidates and election platform. 
</P>
<P>
Constitutional amendments adopted late last year allocate 100 seats to the 
Communist Party in the 750-member Chamber of Deputies elected from "public 
organizations." Although party members had suggested more than 31,500 people 
for those seats, the party Secretariat had reduced them to 314, and the Central 
Committee then nominated 100, one for each seat, at a meeting in January. 
</P>
<P>
Those elected as the party's representatives included most members of the 
12-member Politburo -- a few are running in local constituencies -- along with 
26 workers, 22 professionals and intellectuals, 21 other party officials and 7 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Allied groups, such as the Communist Youth League and the country's trade 
unions, also have sizable blocs in that chamber. In addition, more than 80% of 
the candidates running for the 1,500 territorial seats in two other chambers 
are also party members, but in many cases face stiff competition.

<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Bush Administration will 
make a request for a fiscal year 1989 supplemental appropriation soon, along 
with a request for an unspecified increase in the current admissions limit of 
94,000 refugees allowed in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"This ceiling increase is necessary to accommodate the steadily increasing flow 
of refugees from around the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Administration will discuss the matter with Congress, then propose 
a new limit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev Policies 
</P>
<P>
Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union to the United States has risen sharply 
in recent years, reflecting the policies of Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev to improve human rights and ease political restrictions on those 
wishing to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal year, the United States admitted 20,421 refugees from the 
Soviet Union. The year before, 3,694 refugees trickled out of the Communist 
nation and reached the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that up to 50,000 Soviet citizens will seek refugee status in 
the United States this year. Fitzwater said 14,200 Soviet refugees have already 
emigrated this year, while another 26,000 remain backlogged or are en route. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to $240 Million 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the increase would boost funding for the refugee operations to 
$240 million. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the steady increases in Soviet applicants, Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III told a House Appropriations subcommittee Tuesday that "we can't 
make it" without the additional money. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman said the government plans to spend $85 million of 
the extra money on Soviet applications, an estimated $11.5 million on refugees 
from Africa and $3.5 million on refugees from Southeast Asia.

U.S. MILITARY ATTACHE IN MOSCOW IS EXPELLED; 
</P>
<P>
ACCUSED OF SPYING AND ORDERED OUT LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER WASHINGTON OUSTED 
COUNTERPART

<P>
The Soviet Union accused a U.S. military attache of spying and ordered him to 
leave the country Wednesday, less than a week after his Soviet counterpart was 
ousted from Washington on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said the attache, Lt. Col. Daniel Francis Van Gundy III, 
"attempted to enter a closed area, deliberately diverting from the officially 
permitted route, and clandestinely photographed military facilities." Van Gundy 
was given 48 hours to leave. 
</P>
<P>
But chief ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov also appeared to tacitly 
acknowledge the retaliatory nature of the expulsion order, saying the ousting 
of Van Gundy was a "response to the provocation of the U.S. special services." 
</P>
<P>
"We were not the ones to initiate this process," Gerasimov said. "Now that the 
new Administration in Washington is reviewing its policies, we have some spy 
mania again." 
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy, 42, was assigned to Moscow in November, 1987, and was midway through 
his scheduled tour of duty here. He lives on the embassy compound with his wife 
and two of their three daughters. The family is expected to leave today. Van 
Gundy himself declined Wednesday to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert rejected the charges as "unwarranted, 
inappropriate, without justification and certainly in no way in keeping with 
the positive tone of the U.S.-Soviet relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly appears to us to be a tit-for-tat reaction," Gilbert said. "We are 
considering our response," he added, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck also called Van Gundy's 
expulsion "unwarranted." 
</P>
<P>
She declined to say if Washington will continue the tit-for-tat expulsions or 
permit the situation to cool down. 
</P>
<P>
"We are considering our response," Beck said. "There is a range of options 
available to us but I am not going to comment further on this matter at 
present." 
</P>
<P>
The expulsion comes less than a week after the U.S. government announced March 
9 that it was ousting Soviet Lt. Col. Yuri N. Pakhtusov after a six-month sting 
operation by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The United States said Pakhtusov, 35, contacted a civilian American worker at a 
computer company last August in an effort to obtain sensitive information about 
how the U.S. government protects computer secrets. The employee contacted the 
FBI, which then began its investigation, according to U.S. officials. Neither 
the employee nor the company was named. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source said Pakhtusov was a member of GRU, the Soviet military's 
intelligence arm. Soviet officials last week declined to comment on Pakhtusov's 
alleged affiliation with GRU. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a Provocation 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Gerasimov called the expulsion of Pakhtusov "a provocation, 
uncalled for and unjustified." He said the accusations of espionage against the 
Soviet officer were based on "an artificially cooked scenario staged rather 
clumsily by the FBI" and that his expulsion was "not in line with the spirit of 
peaceful cooperation in U.S.-Soviet relations." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said Pakhtusov was arrested after he left his apartment to take out 
the garbage and a neighbor in the building asked him to come inside his 
apartment "under the pretext that he wanted Pakhtusov's advice concerning the 
repair of a TV set." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the neighbor then "attempted all of a sudden to give Pakhtusov a 
parcel, which he refused to take. At that very moment, FBI agents broke into 
the flat and, resorting to force, handcuffed Pakhtusov." 
</P>
<P>
The last expulsions of American diplomats from the Soviet Union were in 
October, 1986. Then, the Kremlin expelled five American diplomats after 25 
Soviet diplomats were ordered out of the Soviet U.N. Mission in New York.

In a flag-decked ceremony on the White House South Lawn, President Bush on 
Wednesday marked the evolution of the Veterans Administration into the 
Department of Veterans Affairs after swearing in a former Army private to lead 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider the new department to have a vital mission. It is so vital there is 
only one place for the veterans of America: in the Cabinet room with the 
President of the United States," Bush said as the new department secretary, 
Edward J. Derwinski, stood by his side. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swears In Derwinski 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski, a 12-term Illinois congressman who filled high State Department 
posts in the Reagan Administration, was sworn in by Bush in a private ceremony 
in the Roosevelt Room. 
</P>
<P>
The new secretary said Americans thought of veterans in terms immortalized by 
Rudyard Kipling's tribute to the British "Tommy:" 
</P>
<P>
"For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' 'Chuck 'im out, the brute!' 
</P>
<P>
"But it's 'Savior of 'is country' when the guns begin to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
In praising Derwinski as "uniquely suited" to lead the new department, Bush 
said: "He has the skill of a seasoned legislator, the patience of a practical 
administrator, the finesse of a diplomat and the heart of a man who knows what 
it means to start his government career as a private in the U.S. Army."

MUM'S THE WORD AS SECRET LAUNCH TIME GETS AIRED 
</P>

So much for government secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials had quietly passed the word among reporters covering the 
space shuttle here that a satellite would be launched on a Delta rocket 
Wednesday night from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as part of the 
Strategic Defense Initiative, better known as "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
Mum was to be the word, the officials said, until after the launch. Not even 
the date, let alone the time, was to be released. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that shrimp boat captains had been warned to stay out of the area 
between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. PST Wednesday, or that the trade magazine Aviation 
Week &amp; Space Technology estimated the satellite launch time earlier this 
month, or that a NASA spokesman actually announced the launch time during a 
televised shuttle briefing Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Press Kit Overflows 
</P>
<P>
Even the Defense Department's own press kit overflowed with information about 
the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the payload isn't classified, just the time of the launch, said 
Terry Monrad, a spokesman for the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll tell you all kinds of things about it," Monrad said as he handed a 
reporter a complete press kit on the payload -- but only after the reporter 
agreed not to break the embargo on the launch, which had already been announced 
by the NASA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The rocket is the third in a series of launches under the "Delta Star" program. 
The satellite is designed to collect data on rockets as they are launched -- 
"anything that moves," as one Defense Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta Star satellite will use eight sensors to help analysts tell what type 
of rocket has just been launched and whether it is capable of carrying a 
nuclear warhead. 
</P>
<P>
The embargo on reporting the launch time was lifted at 5:27 p.m. PST, one 
minute after the blastoff was postponed because of problems with gases in the 
propulsion system. "The Pogo supression unit malfunctioned," the Air Force 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new launch time is embargoed.

President Bush's nominee for the No. 2 post at the State Department was asked 
Wednesday to give the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a confidential list of 
the clients of his former consulting firm, headed by former Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
The request by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) may delay the committee's vote on the 
nominee, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a former undersecretary of state and 
ambassador to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be safe than sorry . . . and right now, I don't know what the facts 
are," Helms argued in asking for the list. The senator promised the list would 
be held in confidence, saying: "I don't think anybody on this committee would 
leak one word of this." 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger, a 30-year veteran of government service, told the committee he 
would consult with his attorneys on Helms' request, made during the first day 
of Eagleburger's confirmation hearing before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
If the Senate does not act this week, the nomination could be delayed for 
several weeks, since members begin a two-week Easter recess on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger, who was queried by several members of the panel about his ties 
with Kissinger's firm, told the committee he had provided the committee with a 
list of the clients he had personally dealt with at the firm and a description 
of his work for them in a "generic sense." But he said he was prevented from 
disclosing additional information under the firm's confidentiality contract 
with its clients.

UCLA ALLEGES PROFESSOR MISUSED GRANT FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA filed a $500,000 civil suit Wednesday against one of its professors, 
contending that he used university grant funds to purchase electronic equipment 
at inflated prices from a company he co-owned. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also claims that Prof. 
Cavour W. Yeh, 52, of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, approved 
the appointment and payment of salaries to a brother and two sisters without 
disclosing they were relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The university, which said it had been damaged "in excess of $500,000," also 
turned the results of its 15-month investigation over to the Los Angeles County 
district attorney for possible criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Al Albergate, spokesman for the district attorney's office, said he could "only 
confirm that we do have an active investigation into this." He would not 
disclose any details. 
</P>
<P>
Yeh was unavailable for comment. His wife said she knew nothing about the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stern of the law firm Tuttle &amp; Taylor, which filed the action, said 
that in addition to claiming that it had been charged "in excess of the fair 
market value of the equipment," the university declared that it had not 
received some of the material it had paid for. 
</P>
<P>
He could not specify the type of electronic equipment involved or say what 
agencies -- public or private -- provided the grant money involved. 
</P>
<P>
The company, according to the complaint, was called EMtec Engineering Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint asked the court to freeze all "misappropriated" grant funds as 
well as profits and property allegedly derived from their misuse between 
January, 1982, and March, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA said Yeh has been on the faculty since 1967 and received his electrical 
engineering degrees from Caltech. His main field of research is in the field of 
fiber optics communications, a UCLA spokesman said.

U.S. TO LET JAPANESE BUILD THEIR OWN VERSION OF F-16

The Administration has decided to go ahead with plans to allow the Japanese to 
build a version of the F-16 fighter plane, but President Bush has yet to make a 
final decision on terms of the agreement, the chief White House spokesman said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said "there are at least three or four basic 
issues regarding the agreement that we would want to sign" with Japan that 
still must be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, speaking with reporters on Air Force One as Bush flew here for a 
speech, said a final presidential decision on the so-called FSX fighter may not 
come until sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush was "reviewing documents today and reading through position 
papers" on the plane on his way to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Once the President decides on safeguards, "then we would be able to announce 
that we are prepared to go ahead with an agreement," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's deciding are the terms of the agreement that we would want to strike 
for the co-production of the plane," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the deal is the best the United States can arrange with Japan, 
which opposes buying U.S. F-16s. Opponents say the technology transfer will 
help Japan further develop a civilian aviation industry that will compete with 
U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
The conflicting views were aired at a National Security Council meeting 
Wednesday evening called to help resolve differences within the Administration 
over the controversial FSX warplane, which Japan wants to deploy in the late 
1990s.

Reviving a presidential space tradition that had lapsed since 1985, Bush 
praised shuttle commander Michael L. Coats and his crew as "today's pioneers," 
invited the Discovery astronauts and their families to visit the White House 
and pledged "to go forward with a strong, active space program." 
</P>

The astronauts also thrilled Mission Control with video of a 10-minute 
artificial blizzard -- 23 pounds of water that turned instantly to ice off 
Discovery's port wing during a routine fuel cell purge.

A Soviet official today said the Kremlin has resumed military airlifts to 
Afghanistan in response to a guerrilla offensive around the strategic city of 
Jalalabad. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim guerrillas today claimed that they shot down two more aircraft in heavy 
fighting for Jalalabad, Afghanistan's third-largest city. The government 
claimed that 470 insurgents were killed in fighting in the last 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Ambassador Yuri Vorontsov said Moscow resumed airlifting arms to Kabul 
on Wednesday, one month after the Red Army withdrew from the war-torn nation. 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov said the weapons included medium-range Scud B missiles, which have 
reportedly been fired from Kabul at guerrilla positions around Jalalabad, 75 
miles to the east and 40 miles west of the Pakistan border. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said at least 40 Ilyushin-76 transport planes have landed at Kabul 
airport since Wednesday, carrying military supplies and food. 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov accused Pakistan of sending hundreds of its soldiers along with the 
guerrillas in the 10-day battle for Jalalabad, which has been among the most 
intense in Afghanistan's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed the situation with the Pakistanis, and they know what our 
reaction will be if their involvement continues," Vorontsov said. "We are not 
threatening the Pakistanis, but they must stop."

More than 10 million people in Bangladesh, almost one-tenth of the country's 
population, have applied for immigration visas for the United States, a post 
office spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Applications have been pouring in by tens of thousands every day across the 
country, and about 20 million people are expected to have applied by the March 
31 deadline. The rush follows press reports here that the United States will 
grant about 20,000 immigration visas in the next two years to citizens of 162 
under-represented countries through a computerized postal lottery system. A 
newspaper said applicants ranged from bank clerks to street beggars.

Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland) formally took himself out of the race for the No. 
2 leadership job among House Republicans today, but another GOP member vowed to 
nominate Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois for the job and make it a three-way 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who as chairman of the House Republican Conference holds the 
third-ranking job in the GOP hierarchy, made no formal endorsement when he 
announced his decision at a news conference. The job of Republican whip is 
being vacated by Rep. Dick Cheney so he can become President Bush's secretary 
of defense. The remaining candidates are Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois, the 
current deputy whip, and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia.

BOMB WARNING TO PAN AM A MONTH LATE

<P>
Britain sent Pan Am a warning to watch out for radio-cassette bombs two days 
before one blew up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland, killing 270 people, but 
the mailed warning arrived a month late, the airline said today. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am spokesmen in London and New York said a letter sent by the British 
Department of Transport on Dec. 19 at the height of the pre-Christmas mail rush 
was not received until Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transport said warnings were sent to all U.S. and British 
airlines and airport security services Dec. 19, two days before the explosion 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, to look out for bombs hidden in radio-cassette 
players and equipped with barometric fuses triggered by an aircraft's altitude. 
</P>
<P>
The British government acknowledged issuing the warning only after details were 
disclosed in today's edition of the Daily Mirror newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The British transport minister has made no comment on why the warning was kept 
secret from the public. The issue is reviving bitter controversy over what air 
passengers should be told about safety alerts. 
</P>
<P>
The crash on Dec. 21 of the Pan Am Boeing 747, which took off from London's 
Heathrow Airport bound for New York, was Britain's worst air disaster. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration said today it had issued no 
warning similar to the British one. Spokesman Fred Farrar said the agency was 
attempting to find out if any U.S. airlines had been aware of the warning. 
</P>
<P>
"We issued no such warning. We're trying to find out who, if anyone (among U.S. 
airlines), got the warning, if indeed there was such a warning," Farrar said. 
</P>
<P>
A Labor member of Parliament, Alf Morris, said Manchester Airport in England 
also received the warning late -- on Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It is almost unbelievable that in the age of the fax machine, a 
government department puts a life-or-death warning in the Christmas post."

They said the Islamic Conference Organization told member states to boycott 
Rushdie's publishers if they failed to withdraw the book and urged the 
international community to pass laws protecting the beliefs of others. "This 
publication transgresses all norms of civility and decency and is a deliberate 
attempt to malign Islam and the venerated Islamic personality," delegates 
quoted the organization's final declaration on the book as saying.

JAPANESE RESEARCH CHIEF WANTS TO EXPAND WHALE HARVEST TO 825

Japan's research whaling program is too small to be scientifically accurate, so 
more whales should be killed next year, the head of the program said today. 
</P>
<P>
Fukuzo Nagasaki, director of the semi-governmental Institute of Cetacean 
Research, said the 300 whales being caught by Japanese ships in the Antarctic 
this year are not enough to make an accurate assessment of whale stocks and 
should be increased to 825 next season. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that Japan is using the so-called research program to 
continue its whaling industry despite a worldwide moratorium on commercial 
whaling imposed in 1986 by the International Whaling Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Japan officially ended its commercial whaling at the end of the 1986-87 season, 
when it took 1,941 whales. 
</P>
<P>
The following season it told the commission it would kill 875 minke and sperm 
whales for research purposes. But strong opposition from international 
environmental groups led Japan to cut back the research program's goal last 
season to 300 minke whales.

<P>
The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and utilities eased in February to 
84.3% of capacity, the first decline since last September, the government 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board said February's operating rate dropped 0.2 percentage 
point from January's 84.5% level, a point that had not been surpassed in nearly 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The closer factories get to full capacity, the greater the fear they will have 
trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price 
increases. The Fed for a year has been nudging up interest rates in an effort 
to slow economic growth and thus restrain inflation.

MAXICARE FILES BANKRUPTCY PLEA, WILL SELL CALIF. HMO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Debt-ridden Maxicare Health Plans Inc., a major provider of health coverage 
serving 1 million Americans in a dozen states, filed today in Santa Ana for 
bankruptcy court protection and indicated that it will sell its HMO serving 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which operates under the names Maxicare, HealthCare USA and 
HealthAmerica, announced that it sought protection from its creditors under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare promised to keep serving its patients and to continue paying doctors 
and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the filing are the Los Angeles-based parent company and operations 
in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare, saddled by debt and generally tight times in the HMO business, has 
been losing money for some time. In recent months it has sold a number of 
health plans in various states in an avowed effort to pare down to a solid 
"core" business. 
</P>
<P>
However, in announcing the bankruptcy filing, Chairman Peter S. Ratican 
revealed Maxicare was negotiating sale of the HMO serving California, 
previously said to be part of the core. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1988, the company lost $250.5 million. Final 1988 
results haven't been reported. 
</P>
<P>
The company, burdened with debt that included, in December, $150 million in 
bank loans and $295 million in bonds, has pinned its recovery hopes on paring 
down to a "core" of solid businesses. As of Dec. 6, Maxicare had cut membership 
from a high of 2.3 million to 1.4 million. Several plans in various states have 
been sold this year, and in its announcement today, the company put membership 
at 1 million.

Texaco Inc., the nation's third largest oil company, said today its board of 
directors adopted a new shareholder rights plan to deter possible hostile 
takeover attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Texaco shareholders will receive rights to purchase a new 
series of junior preferred stock at the rate of one right for each share of 
common stock held at the close of business April 3, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
"The board of directors was concerned that, without a rights plan in place, 
control of the company could be acquired in the open market without fair value 
being offered to each and every Texaco shareholder," said President James 
Kinnear. 
</P>
<P>
New York financier Carl Icahn, who made a $60-a-share bid for the company last 
year, owns about 42 million shares, or 17%, of Texaco's stock.

LIMIT ON AT&amp;T PROFITS REMOVED; CAP PUT ON LONG-DISTANCE CHARGES

<P>
The Federal Communications Commission today approved American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co.'s plan to put a lid on its long-distance telephone charges but 
remove the ceiling on its profits. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which takes effect July 1, will modify the regulations set when 
AT&amp;T had a monopoly on the nation's long-distance services and further 
intensify competition in that $50-billion market. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, AT&amp;T's long-distance rates can rise no more than the rate 
of inflation minus 3%. If inflation is 5%, for example, the company can 
increase prices 2%. 
</P>
<P>
But within that constraint, AT&amp;T's long-distance profits will be allowed to 
rise without limit. The company can choose its own rates within the price 
ceiling and keep any savings it achieves through cutting costs and bolstering 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street reacted favorably to the news. AT&amp;T shares rose 12.5 cents to 
$32.75 as the New York Stock Exchange's second most-active issue this morning. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's profits are currently limited to a 12% return on investment -- a 
holdover from its days as a monopoly. AT&amp;T had complained that rivals U.S. 
Sprint Communications Co. and MCI Communications Corp. have no such 
restrictions and that the profit limit took away its incentive to cut costs or 
improve efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC estimated that the plan will save long-distance customers $900 million 
over the next four years, with $700 million going to residential savings and 
$200 million to business savings. 
</P>
<P>
To assure that AT&amp;T spreads out savings equally among its customers, the 
regulation requires it to separate operating costs into three baskets: 
residential and small businesses, large businesses and special services using 
toll-free 800 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Separate baskets will prevent AT&amp;T from cross-subsidizing its operations 
and assure that residential and small business users benefit from the new plan, 
FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators have spent two years studying the plan, which is expected to 
pressure the long-distance rivals that have dogged AT&amp;T since the 1984 
breakup of the Bell System. AT&amp;T controls 67% of the U.S. long-distance 
market.

the Oilers, the first on the injured reserve list with finger and knee 
injuries. Last season he played in 14 Oiler games and one of the team's two 
playoff games. The 6-foot-3, 290-pound Baugh was a backup center for 1 1/2 
seasons at Kansas City and then landed the starter's job. He spent the final 
four weeks of last season on injured reserve following knee surgery.

Groundskeepers at Wrigley Field went on strike today, and laborers installing 
sky boxes at the Chicago Cubs ballpark honored the picket lines, threatening 
preparations for the April 4 season opener. 
</P>
<P>
But the team issued a statement saying operations at the ballpark would not be 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
The groundskeepers began picketing outside the field at midnight, said Richard 
Malkowsky, secretary treasurer of Local 25 of the Service Employees 
International Union. He said that the union's contract with the Cubs expired 
last Dec. 31 and that talks with team officials broke down Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The groundskeepers walked out over a management effort to cut nearly in half 
their $14-an-hour wage and win other concessions, said Sam Bongiorno, a 23-year 
veteran of the grounds crew. The 24 groundskeepers' average pay is $21,000 a 
year, Malkowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs' statement expressed surprise at the strike, saying that discussions 
with groundskeepers were "proceeding in an orderly fashion" and that grounds 
crew employees had continued a normal work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Malkowsky said the ballplayers' union will be asked to join the picket lines 
when players return from spring training in Mesa, Ariz., but, he said, "I'm 
hoping we can resolve it before the season starts."

Bob Dukiet was fired today as Marquette basketball coach after two consecutive

Published reports named possible candidates for the coaching position as former 
Indiana and NBA standout Quinn Buckner, Creighton coach Tony Barone, 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee coach Steve Antrim, Syracuse assistant Bernie Fine, DePaul 
assistant Jim Molinari and Texas-San Antonio coach Ken Burmeister.

Dukiet could not be reached for comment today, but he told a Milwaukee
