FEWER PILOTS DITCHING NAVY TO JOIN AIRLINE RANKS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: BONUS PROGRAM AND THE THRILL OF FLYING HIGH-PERFORMANCE AIRCRAFT HELP 
TO INCREASE RETENTION RATE.

During the two years that Navy pilot Lt. John Kuznik has been stationed in San 
Diego, he has actually been in the city for only nine months. Most of the time 
he was at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a house and bills to pay, it's real inconvenient. Even if you're 
not married, it's real tough," said Kuznik, 28, who joined the Navy almost six 
years ago . Following a well-trodden path, Kuznik is now considering signing up 
with one of the airlines that are actively wooing military pilots. For the 
Navy, Kuznik represents a decade-old problem of private industry luring away 
its pilots who have received about $1 million in training. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first time in recent years, the Navy has managed to slow the 
longtime trend of losing pilots, who can spend as much as 13 years at sea 
during a 20-year career. By offering yearly bonuses of as much as $12,000 to 
aviators, the Navy is finally gaining on what has been a losing situation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the Navy started offering bonuses of $6,000 as incentive to pilots, 
whose ranks were being dramatically thinned by airlines. Last year, that bonus 
was doubled. The Navy tries to get pilots more flight time, but can't guarantee 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It will allow us to compete. Are we licking the problem? We are looking at it 
aggressively," said Capt. Kendell Pease, spokesman of the Military Personnel 
Command in Washington. "It doesn't do us any good to train these people and 
have them go right out the door." 
</P>
<P>
When a military pilot bails out, his income may initially drop until he gains 
seniority. Experienced military pilots earn about $45,000 annually, while 
commercial pilots earn from $25,000 to $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
When the airlines hired almost 8,000 pilots in 1985, more than the industry had 
hired in any one year before, the Navy's retention rate dropped to 32% -- its 
lowest in years. Last year, that rate climbed to 38%, which was 4% more than 
1987. It's the first significant upturn in what had been a downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Navy was short 1,200 pilots. A year before, it was 1,300 short. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific Fleet, where the naval aviators monitor more than 100 million 
square miles from the U.S. West Coast to Africa's east coast, the retention 
rates are better than the Navywide average. In 1989, the retention rate was 
62%. Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard, a spokesman, attributed the difference to West 
Coast leadership, quality of life and flight hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is you have to find the guy, train him, and keep him -- that's 
the hardest part of the equation," said Vice Adm. John H. Fetterman Jr., 
commander naval aviation in the Pacific. "My greatest concern is erosion of 
people, officers and enlisted. Once you erode that, it's an investment that's 
hard to re-establish." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Navy officers are not trying for 100% retention because they want enough 
turnover to be able to promote new pilots. The official goal is to retain 43%, 
Pease said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has also been hit hard by the airline industry. Its retention 
rate dropped from 59% in 1985 to 36% last year, far short of the official goal 
of 62%. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Air Force, it's been a serious hemorrhage of pilots," said Maj. Lou 
Figueroa, a Washington spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Most agree that although the bonus has helped, money is not the reason pilots 
stay in the military. Pilots say they stay because they love flying 
high-performance aircraft, the challenge of landing on an aircraft carrier 
pitching in the sea, and the thrill of being catapulted off a ship deck. 
</P>
<P>
And for many military pilots, airliners are dull by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"I liken flying airliners to bus driving -- it's not really for me," said Lt. 
Scott Jacobson, a 30-year-old Rockville, Ill.-native who joined the Navy five 
years ago and has become a helicopter pilot. "It's not really exciting flying 
-- they're bus drivers going from A to B." 
</P>
<P>
Still others have begun to see how the military life style could wear thin. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Chris Kalafut, a 24-year-old Oceanside native, is married. He joined the 
Navy two years ago because he has always wanted to fly off an aircraft carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all new and exciting now but again it's all new. After seven years, it 
could be the same old thing," Kalafut said. "In a few years, my wife and I will 
have some children, and I'd like to be home more than six months a year." 
</P>
<P>
Family separation and "geographic widowhood" are among the most common reasons 
cited by pilots leaving the Navy. For Kalafut, his frequent transfers make it 
difficult for his wife to embark on a profession. 
</P>
<P>
Kalafut, whose cheeks flush as he describes carrier landings, is not interested 
in becoming an airline pilot today, but he's glad that the option is open to 
him. Right now, the thrill of flying outweighs the inconvenience of the 
military life style. And he's more interested in flight hours than flight 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Air Force, the pilot of an F-15 Eagle fighter jet will have about 15 
hours in the cockpit each month. The pilot of a cargo plane gets about 26 hours 
monthly. The Navy's Pacific Fleet pilots fly about 21 hours monthly, Pritchard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of giving $10,000, I'd much rather give a guaranteed 25 flight hours a 
month because these guys love to fly," said Vice Adm. Fetterman. "They do it 
because they love it, because they want to be part of the fraternity. You could 
be corny and say they want to be the 'Right Stuff.' "

SANTA CLARA IS DIZZY OVER STATE BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATION: FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE YEAR, A SMALL CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL HAS 
A SHOT AT THE DIVISON IV STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. A NOISY SEND-OFF FIRES UP THE 
TEAM.

<P>
A contagious fever swept across the Santa Clara High School campus in Oxnard on 
Thursday, sending 720 giddy teen-agers home early and causing officials to 
cancel all of Friday's classes. 
</P>
<P>
It was basketball fever. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, the small Catholic school's basketball team has 
beaten back all of its Southern California rivals to win a shot at the Division 
IV state prep basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara won last year's state title. This year's season finale will match 
the defending champions Friday night against Northern California's top small 
school -- Vanden High of Fairfield. 
</P>
<P>
So many Santa Clara students plan to travel north by car, bus and plane to 
watch the 8 p.m. game at the Oakland Coliseum that school officials decided to 
shut down the campus. 
</P>
<P>
And they dismissed everyone early on Thursday so the 14-member team could fly 
north in mid-afternoon to rest for the big game. Sports league rules prohibit 
athletes from leaving before school is out for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of an Oxnard school winning back-to-back state basketball 
championships left the Saviers Road campus in an excited daze. 
</P>
<P>
Shouts of "Repeat! Repeat!" echoed through the Santa Clara gymnasium as the 
student body gathered Thursday morning to give the team a noisy send-off. 
Students watched reverently as players received flowers and balloons and kisses 
from Sister Anne Eugene, the principal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hot gym, sophomore Steven Klein wore his heavy blue-and-gold 
football letterman's jacket in honor of the cage team. 
</P>
<P>
"They're gonna win the state championship again. I'm sure of it," said Klein, 
16. "But I'm going to be proud of them no matter what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the gym, cheerleader Cyndee Corral, also 16, practiced a dance her 
group will perform at Friday's game: "You Can't Touch Us." 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Clara's such a small school that everyone knows everyone here," she 
explained as her friends cheered her on. "Everyone's proud of being here." 
</P>
<P>
Corral interrupted her impromptu routine to run to the side of Shon Tarver, the 
6-foot-5 senior guard who has been Santa Clara's key player during its 44-game 
win streak. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, 17, has averaged more than 31 points per game this year. Last week, he 
scored 40 points against Santa Maria's St. Joseph High School to lead the 
Oxnard school to the Southern California Regional Division IV title. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver grinned shyly as Corral gave him a hug and a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
That happens a lot to the "Big Man on Campus," according to Taryn Tarver, 
Shon's 15-year-old freshman sister. 
</P>
<P>
"Five of my friends have asked me to set them up with him. They make him 
cookies and stuff. Liz Ortiz sends him cookies before every game. He loves 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Taryn Tarver is one of 112 students who managed to reserve seats on two buses 
that were scheduled to leave about 6 a.m. Friday for Oakland. They will return 
about 5 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
School secretary Joanne Kincaid said 
</P>
<P>
twice that many students wanted to go, but the Greyhound bus strike made it 
impossible to line up more buses. 
</P>
<P>
Other students were begging for rides from friends' parents on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom and dad and sister and I will go in our tank, our '75 Olds Cutlass," 
said Dawnte Anderson, 14, a freshman. "It's the kind of car you can fit a lot 
of people in." 
</P>
<P>
Monica Maestas, also 14, said her grandparents from Garden Grove will join her 
family for the ride to the Oakland game. She predicted that many students from 
other Oxnard schools also may make the 380-mile trip. 
</P>
<P>
"You always see a lot of people from town at our games," Maestas said. "You see 
school jackets from Channel Islands and Oxnard, Rio Mesa, Hueneme." 
</P>
<P>
Students at Oxnard's public high schools said they are pulling for Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rooting for them. I've got a lot of friends who go there. If it was going 
to be on TV, I'd be watching," said Brandon Webber, 15, a ninth-grader at 
Oxnard High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ruperto G. Cisneros, principal of Oxnard High, said he will also be cheering 
for Santa Clara -- even though it beat his school in a non-league practice game 
earlier this season. "We hung real tough the first three quarters, then Tarver 
took over," Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very proud that a school in our community was able to reach that level 
of success. There's a lot of community pride in what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
At Oxnard City Hall, Mayor Nao Takusugi agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Clara's one of the greatest ambassadors of goodwill for the city of 
Oxnard," said Takusugi, who has attended several of the school's games this 
season. "They bring recognition to the city. We're behind them 100%. Win or 
lose, we'll be honoring them." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard merchant Jessie Lucio said City Hall presentations are becoming the norm 
for Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the City Council almost has a spot reserved for them in their 
chambers," said Lucio, manager of the Sports Zone sportswear shop at the Center 
Point shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Lucio said there has been a run on blue-and-gold Santa Clara sportswear since 
the school made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out of hats and down to my last three shirts," he said. "I'm hurting. I've 
got customers calling all the way from Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is counting on Santa Clara to win. He added that he has already 
ordered shirts imprinted with "Back to Back Champions" that he hopes to put on 
sale next week. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard sports observers said that while the city basks in the Santa Clara 
team's glow, the unusual winning streak is really a reflection of the work of 
Coach Lou Cvijanovich, 63. He has worked at the school since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to schedule schools of higher caliber in practice games. He teaches 
these kids how to be men," said John W. Borchard Sr., an Oxnard citrus rancher 
whose family arrived in Ventura County in 1860. 
</P>
<P>
Although Borchard played high school basketball at Villanova Prep in Ojai in 
the late 1920s, he attends most of Santa Clara's games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be in Oakland on Friday if my wife hadn't scheduled an important social 
engagement in Los Angeles that night," said Borchard, 76. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Berry, a 1963 Santa Clara graduate who heads the school's booster club, 
said Santa Clara's spirit has been building since Cvijanovich, known as "Mr. C" 
on campus, arrived at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fever that started when he came," said Berry, 44. "You see it at the 
games when you look around and there are former students and former athletes in 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fever that he started and never stopped."

PET ISSUE IS BACK IN THE SADDLE; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: IN A REPLAY OF THE FAMILIAR RAGTIME TUNE, CITY ASKS A RESIDENT 
TO GET RID OF TWO MINIATURE HORSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, which lost one legal tiff over a miniature horse named Ragtime, 
has decided to wage another legal battle -- this time with a man who keeps two 
of the small horses in his back yard at a housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are asking Greg Bowlay to remove the miniature horses from his 
house on Calle Castano because they say his 13,000-square-foot lot is too 
small. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Nancy Kierstyn Schreiner said the city wants to send a 
message to the community that miniature horses are unwelcome in densely 
populated residential areas, despite a judge's decision allowing Patty and 
Richard Fairchild to keep their miniature horse, Ragtime, at their home on 
Shady Brook Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlay, who has been issued two municipal citations for having the horses, said 
he plans to battle the city in court. He has pleaded not guilty, and the case 
is scheduled to be heard by a Ventura County municipal judge on April 10. The 
maximum penalty for each citation is $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Schreiner said she is confident that Thousand Oaks can win the fight against 
Bowlay because it has eliminated loopholes in its ordinance regulating 
miniature horses that resulted in a three-year losing struggle in the Ragtime 
case. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, a Ventura municipal judge dismissed the city's case against 
the Fairchilds because, he said, the part of the Thousand Oaks zoning code 
dealing with horses was poorly worded. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city adopted a new ordinance prohibiting a single horse of any 
size on a lot smaller than 20,000 square feet. That stipulation was missing 
from the previous ordinance, Schreiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks then cited the Fairchilds under the revised ordinance. But a 
municipal judge ruled that, because of Ragtime's size, the miniature horse was 
considered a domestic pet under city regulations and could remain at the Shady 
Brook Drive home. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the city, which received worldwide attention in the Ragtime case, 
again changed its ordinance. The definition of a domestic pet was altered to 
include dogs, cats, tropical fish, small rodents and small reptiles. It defined 
miniature horses, as well as pot-bellied pigs and other small animals, as 
livestock and prohibited them in densely populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bowlay said the city is trying to "save face" after losing the Ragtime battle 
by unfairly targeting him. 
</P>
<P>
"They took that loss very personally," Bowlay said. "Now they're coming after 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Schreiner said the case has nothing to do with the city's pride. She said her 
office has received several complaints from neighbors who say Bowlay's horses 
stink. Moreover, the city is enforcing its ordinance, which was adopted to 
protect the community, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to consider their neighbors," Schreiner said. "You don't bring 
pigs, horses and goats into a housing tract . . . where people are living close 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Bowlay, a former state Department of Corrections officer who has been out of 
work because of a medical disability, said two miniature horses, named Apache 
and Chips, have been kept in a large pen in his back yard since July. 
</P>
<P>
He said he bought Chips for his daughter, Rachelle, 6, and liked him so much 
that he bought Apache for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider them pets," Bowlay said. "They're part of my family." 
</P>
<P>
Philip R. Dunn, Bowlay's attorney, said he has a good case against the city. 
But he conceded that it will be more difficult to beat City Hall this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"They have learned from their mistakes," Dunn said. "You get caught with your 
pants down the first time; the second time, you know what you've done wrong."

WORKER INDICTED OVER KICKBACKS AT NAVAL STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A civilian Navy employee at the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu was indicted 
Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles on suspicion of soliciting and 
accepting up to $2,000 in kickbacks in exchange for a government painting 
contract, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jammie Lee Nash, 38, was arrested early Thursday by agents of the FBI and the 
Naval Investigative Service, said Assistant U.S. Atty. David A. Sklansky, who 
is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
Nash was released on a $10,000 signature bond after appearing before U.S. 
Magistrate Joseph Reichmann in Los Angeles. He is scheduled to be arraigned 
March 19. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Lynn Becraft, 43, of Lovelock, Nev., and Eugene Baxter, 43, of Long 
Beach, both former contractors at the Naval Air Station, were also charged 
Thursday with providing Nash with kickbacks, Sklansky said. Becraft and Baxter 
have not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest followed a three-year joint investigation by the FBI and the Naval 
Investigative Service, said Lt. Cmdr. Gene Okamoto, a Naval Air Station 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
He said that although Nash is still employed at the base, he was reassigned 
from his job as a contract inspector to another post when the investigation 
began. He said he does not know what Nash's present job is. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that in 1987, Nash, while a contract inspector at the 
base, solicited and accepted from Baxter and Becraft 10% to 20% of a $17,262 
government contract to paint 15 housing units, Sklansky said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Nash faces a maximum sentence of seven years in federal prison 
and a $350,000 fine. Baxter and Becraft each face a maximum sentence of one 
year and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, the U.S. attorney's office has prosecuted more than 
100 defendants, including corporations and individuals, in a variety of defense 
fraud cases, including bribery, false representation and overbilling, said 
William Fahey, chief of the government fraud division of the U.S. attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Northrop Corp. pleaded guilty to 34 criminal fraud charges and 
agreed to pay the government $17 million to end a massive criminal case, Fahey 
said. A year ago, a $5.5-million fine was imposed on Rockwell International 
Corp. for fraudulently overbilling the Air Force on a satellite navigation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Fahey said more than $70 billion in defense contracts are awarded to 
contractors in Southern California every year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very big business," Fahey said. "We take all bribery and fraud cases 
seriously because protecting the integrity of the process is important to us." 
</P>
<P>
Fahey said his office has 20 investigators and 12 prosecutors who spend a 
majority of their time on fraud cases.

MOTHER MAY LOSE CHILD OVER COCAINE

<P>
A Thousand Oaks woman who pleaded guilty to endangering her baby daughter could 
lose custody after admitting breast-feeding the baby while using cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, Elizabeth Benge, 31, was given three years probation after she 
pleaded guilty to charges of endangering Rhiannon Brittany Brown, now 2 months 
old. 
</P>
<P>
The child is now in the care of an aunt. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge on Thursday postponed the custody hearing until April 5, 
a court clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
Benge will have to undergo counseling and drug testing as part of the two-year 
drug diversion program she has agreed to enter. If she completes the program, 
the charge of being under the influence of cocaine could be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Benge's lawyer, Edward J. Lacey, who represented her at the plea hearing 
Wednesday, said Benge volunteered the information about her cocaine use to 
medical workers at Los Robles Regional Medical Center to help her baby. 
</P>
<P>
The baby was hospitalized briefly after testing positive for cocaine and 
showing signs of increased blood pressure and rapid heart rate, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Barbara Rizzieri said. 
</P>
<P>
Benge and the child's father were arrested by sheriff's deputies Feb. 16 after 
they took the infant to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Benge admitted to medical workers that she had breast-fed the child and snorted 
cocaine before the baby became ill, Rizzieri said. 
</P>
<P>
Rhiannon's father, Donald Brown, 31, faces trial next Wednesday on a 
child-endangerment charge, Rizzieri said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: WATER CONSERVATION PROPOSAL DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT LAWRENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal that would penalize farmers and growers for excessive use of water 
and encourage efficient irrigation drew a mixed response at a public hearing 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, proposed for 1992 by the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management 
Agency, also reduces allotments to customers, now based on past usage, by 5%. 
The measure is designed to reduce by 25% the water taken from underground 
sources through much of central Ventura County by 2015. 
</P>
<P>
The agency regulates the use of 150,000 acre-feet of ground water annually. The 
water is used by water companies and cities within a 185-square mile region of 
the county. Farmers use about 70% of the agency's water. 
</P>
<P>
John Crowley, head of the agency, said at a hearing Thursday at the county 
government center that the measure would achieve that reduction in stages over 
23 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I would definitely call this a conservation measure," Ventura County 
hydrologist Rick Farnsworth said. "This will have the biggest impact on the 
growers." 
</P>
<P>
Rewards would be available to growers who can demonstrate an irrigation 
efficiency of 80% or better. 
</P>
<P>
But farmers who use more than their predetermined allotments would incur 
penalties and be forced to pay as much as $200 for exceeding quotas by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main purposes of this ordinance is to show that farming is a 
business," said Len Maulhardt, agency chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"Growers need to make a decision whether to invest in better irrigation methods 
or to pay the stiff penalties. If they're having a hard time growing celery at 
80% efficiency, then they can either rotate two crops instead of three or move 
to dry beans for a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Some attending the hearing praised the proposal. Others questioned whether the 
conservation measures would be fairly applied districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
Another public hearing is scheduled for March 23. SCOTT LAWRENCE

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: WARM DAY NO HELP TO FISHERMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sol White, a self-described "pier aficionado," showed up at the Ventura Pier 
early Thursday afternoon, parked his bicycle and threw out his fishing line. 
</P>
<P>
At first his fiddle stayed shut in its black case. The 59-year-old retired 
doctor, dressed in jeans with red suspenders, said he only plays if the fish 
aren't biting. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't take long before White had the shiny wooden instrument to his 
chin. Soon "Turkey in the Straw" was competing with low-flying gulls screeching 
their own songs to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature reached 71 on the Ventura coast by early afternoon, making 
Thursday one of the warmest days in weeks, but that didn't mean that fish were 
biting. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from White, Red Maurer pulled up his crab net, found the chunks of 
shark and perch bait untouched and then reeled in his fishing pole. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going home," the 61-year-old Ventura resident told White in a disgusted 
tone. "Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think if I play my fiddle, they bite better," White said. But 
Maurer, a fleshy old man with a stubbled beard, said he knew when to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me the mayor of the Ventura Pier. I've been coming here every day 
for 49 years," Maurer said before packing his gear on his bicycle and heading 
toward land. 
</P>
<P>
There were also a few young people on the landmark 118-year-old pier on the 
sunny, clear weekday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Melody Hook, 20, of Ventura said that she would normally have been "watching 
soaps" but that she brought her 5-month-old Labrador-boxer mix puppy to see the 
ocean instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to convince her to go in the water, but she's scared of it," Hook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Truman Brown, 19, of Ventura stood glumly by his fishing pole. The independent 
contractor said he was whiling away the afternoon because he didn't have any 
work that day. And all he'd caught was seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick of this place," he said suddenly. "Nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
The older men didn't act so impatient. "I remember when we did night fishing 
down here," Willie Martinez, 74, said to Larry Luna, a 72-year-old Santa Paula 
resident he sees there almost every day, "and get bass this big." He held his 
hands out a foot apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't see them no more," Luna said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pier fisherman," said White, who has lived in many states but now 
resides in Ventura. "I've fished them up and down the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
White rated the Ventura Pier as "kind of interesting. You don't know what to 
expect. Last week, a bunch of dolphins came up," he said, waving one arm toward 
the ocean on one side of the pier. "They played around, and then they finally 
went out." PENELOPE McMILLAN

Thursday. The retired doctor said that he only plays when the fish aren't 
biting and that some of the pier fishermen believe his tunes help bring in the 
catch. Above, Melody Hook, who said she would have been indoors watching soap 
operas if she hadn't wanted to show her puppy the beach, plays with Jenny in 
the sand while walking near the pier. Below, a couple read the newspaper while 
taking in a view of the ocean. Early afternoon highs in the low 70s made the 
day one of the warmest in weeks and brought many people outdoors. DEBRA MYRENT

CARSON'S NEW COMPUTER PACT RULED INVALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Carson city attorney said this week that a $258,000 contract for computer 
services signed by Mayor Michael Mitoma on Jan. 29 is not valid because the 
contract was not approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Glenn Watson said the council can approve the contract to validate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Jack Smith said he would put the contract on the agenda for 
ratification Tuesday. He said the council should have approved the contract 
before it was signed. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, that is probably the law. They should approve the contract," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he thought it was not necessary to obtain prior council approval 
because the council had approved preparation of the agreement and the contract 
does not bind the city to an immediate financial commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The contract specifies that the city has a free, 60-day trial period and then 
15 days to decide whether it likes the computer system. The firm providing the 
services, Ultimate Intermountain Inc. of Orem, Utah, began the trial period 
Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Smith was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council had not seen the written agreement and a contractual document 
differs from a proposal even though the (Nov. 21) minutes show approval in 
concept as proposed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, sending the proposed agreement to the mayor for signature 
without first submitting it to the City Council for approval was not the 
correct procedure, since the contracting authority of the city is vested in the 
City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Mitoma said he had not read the contract when he signed it and still has not 
gone over it. "I haven't read it," he said in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
He said he signed it after seeing that Assistant City Atty. Kevin G. Ennis had 
also signed it. 
</P>
<P>
"I sign probably on the average of 60 contracts or agreements or minutes a 
month. . . . It was just in with everything else that needed a mayor's 
signature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Ennis' signature was meant to imply only that the contract was 
correctly drafted, not that the council had approved it. 
</P>
<P>
The city's goal in the contract is to update the existing computer system. 
Among the elements the city wants are: 
</P>
<P>
An electronic mail system throughout City Hall and additional word processors. 
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive database for the Building and Safety, Planning and Community 
Development departments that would include detailed information about all 
properties and buildings in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Spreadsheet programs for city finances to enable officials to track revenues 
and spending with greater ease. 
</P>
<P>
Computer equipment for the Carson Community Center and Department of Parks and 
Recreation.

BANK ROBBER GETS 4 YEARS IN PRISON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura man was sentenced to four years and three months in prison Thursday 
for robbing three Ventura County banks last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Ellsworth Farrant, 51, also was ordered by U.S. District Judge 
Laughlin E. Waters to spend three years under supervision after his release, 
the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura police arrested Farrant on Sept. 30, 1989, after he was identified by 
the public based on information released through the media. 
</P>
<P>
He was indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on eight counts of bank 
robbery, including seven in Ventura County and one in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 5, Farrant pleaded guilty to the robberies of Security Pacific National 
Bank in Oxnard, California Federal Savings in Port Hueneme and Imperial Savings 
Assn. in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Farrant is a former aerospace engineer who turned to bank robbery after he had 
developed a heroin habit, federal officials said. JOANNA MILLER

GARDENA HIGH SPEECH TEAM HOPES TO TALK ITS WAY TO STATE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After winning the Los Angeles All District Speech Tournament for the fourth 
consecutive year, members of the Gardena High School varsity forensic team will 
compete Saturday to qualify for the California High School Assn. State 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-member team scored the most points last week, winning the championship 
in 15 hours of competition against 37 other high schools in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Some students were up all night preparing for the contest. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a typical tournament at all," senior Pedro Olmedo, 17, said. "It was 
extremely stressful. We were all tired. But we knew what we had to do and we 
pulled ourselves together through team spirit and did it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were working for that team trophy,"said senior Robin Pelle. "We wanted to 
win it for Mrs. Paddor." 
</P>
<P>
Lois Paddor is the team's speech coach and has been preparing Gardena High 
School students for speech competitions for 16 years. This year, the National 
Forensics League, a high school speech honors organization, ranked the team in 
the top 3% of all high schools in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It all goes back to Mrs. Paddor," said Shelly Ward who won first place in 
individual competition for her Original Advocacy Speech on child molestation. 
"She stresses the importance of doing well in competition. She says just have 
fun and be yourself." 
</P>
<P>
But Paddor does not take all the credit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm their coach and their teacher and, hopefully to some, a friend," she said. 
"But it comes down to them. They are the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
The Gardena High School team has consistently been the largest in the 
competition since its inception four years ago, Paddor said. The team's size, 
talent, know-how and cultural variety, she said, make a winning combination. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think that's our strength," Principal Tom Ikeda said. "When I look at 
all the other schools competing, I find that our rainbow of colors is 
brighter." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the team -- which includes blacks, Asians, Latinos and whites -- 
tend to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at our two biggest competitors at the tournament (San Pedro and 
Sherman Oaks high schools), you will see much less cultural diversity," said 
teammate Brian Yamasaki, who is class valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said: "We add more flavor to the competition, more interesting topics, and 
more perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Sean Bell, 17, wrote a speech in the form of a rap titled "I'm in a 
Gang," describing the hazards of being a gang member in South-Central Los 
Angeles. "I grew up there," Bell said. "I grew up near some pretty horrible 
people. . . . Bring that knowledge to people and it gives them some insight 
into what I have been through," he said. "And although it affected me, I have 
survived." 
</P>
<P>
Bell praises the speech made by teammate Tracy Kobayashi on the life of a 
Japanese girl after the bombing of Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
"She brought a Japanese perspective to her speech," he said. "That's what a lot 
of us do in all of our speeches." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Gardena team members will compete as individuals, attempting to 
qualify for the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
How will they do? Paddor said: "Their record speaks for itself."

TORRANCE'S CHAMBER TURNS BACK ON BEAUTY; 
</P>
<P>
PAGEANT: BUSINESS LEADERS AND THE CITY COUNCIL OBJECTED WHEN OFFICIALS CHANGED 
THE BEAUTY CONTEST TITLE TO MISS TORRANCE-BEACH CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For the first time in recent memory, there will be no smiling Miss Torrance 
waving to the crowds at the city's annual Armed Forces Day Parade this May. 
</P>
<P>
And future Torrance ribbon-cuttings and Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce 
social gatherings will be taking place without an official community beauty on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to city and chamber of commerce officials, is that the 
local beauty pageant simply isn't very local anymore, and they have decided not 
to invite the reigning queen to attend any official functions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials first began grumbling last year, when Cheryl Anthony of Gardena, the 
1989 Miss Torrance, spent her first few days on the job trying to persuade the 
Torrance City Council not to withdraw its $750 in support. Council members, 
miffed that she and many previous winners had not been residents of their city, 
canceled the funding. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, pageant sponsors decided to change the name, adding the words "Beach 
Cities" to attract more contestants from other cities already included in the 
pageant's area of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Miss Torrance-Beach Cities, 19-year-old Connie Leamon, won her 
crown three weeks ago, but this week she found out her official appearances at 
chamber functions were over. 
</P>
<P>
She also will not be getting an invitation to the city's May 19 parade, an 
event characterized by previous queens as the highlight of their reigns. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber officials say the addition of "Beach Cities" to the title means the new 
beauty queen no longer is a true Torrance representative, even though the 
Torrance pageant has welcomed contestants from other South Bay cities 
throughout its 24-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Parade organizers agree. 
</P>
<P>
"There haven't been any plans to include a Miss Torrance because we don't have 
a Miss Torrance anymore. It's some other name," said Councilman Bill Applegate, 
who chairs the council committee that oversees the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Leamon, a resident of Lawndale who became Miss Torrance-Beach Cities on Feb. 
25, said the controversy around her title is "completely unfair." 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 graduate of West High School in Torrance, Leamon said much of her daily 
life revolves around the city of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to junior high school and high school in Torrance, and I go to school 
in Torrance now" at El Camino College, she said. "My family couldn't afford to 
live in Torrance anymore and we moved out of Torrance to Lawndale, but Torrance 
is still a big part of me." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden Torrance cold shoulder came without warning, just one week after 
Leamon had attended a Torrance chamber gathering. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody seemed pretty happy to meet me and see the new queen. I didn't feel 
any negativity," Leamon said. "And now this. It hurts. Obviously, it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Her calendar of appearances now is filling with business gatherings in 
Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Carson, as well as the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, the other areas from which contestants are accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to go ahead and represent the other cities as best I can," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance pageant is a preliminary for the Miss California Pageant. The 
winner of that contest then goes on to the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Under Miss America pageant rules, entrants may either live, work or go to 
school in the franchise area of the local contests. Using those rules, many 
women enter several pageants. Leamon entered five others before winning the 
Miss Torrance-Beach Cities title. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance chamber officials insist their decision is "a simple thing" based on 
the title change. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer the Miss Torrance Pageant. It no longer is a hometown pageant. 
It's taken on a whole new meaning," chamber General Manager Barbara Glennie 
said. "When she was partly financed by the city, we would invite her to various 
things. She no longer is an official representative of the city." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber has been stung by criticism of their decision by Andrea Reeder, 
executive director of the Miss Torrance-Beach Cities Pageant, who wrote a 
five-page letter protesting the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take a bum rap for something when we're not trying to hurt 
anybody. . . . It's certainly nothing personal to the young woman at all," 
Glennie said, noting that Leamon may still come to chamber functions as a guest 
of Reeder, who belongs to the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just saying we're not backing this in any kind of official capacity at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
Glennie said Reeder "put tremendous pressure" on the chamber to publicize the 
pageant and invite the beauty queen to every chamber function. 
</P>
<P>
"If Andrea Reeder and her team had not put so much pressure on us that they 
wanted to literally blitz the business community . . . I don't think the 
reaction would have been as immediate or strong, but she was very aggressively 
demanding and put us in a very uncomfortable position." 
</P>
<P>
Reeder, who runs her own word-processing business and volunteers her time to 
the pageant, said she will cancel her chamber membership unless the decision is 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I possibly ethically attend a Torrance chamber function when it slaps 
in the face the community activity in which I'm involved?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Reeder says she called the chamber's offices occasionally to get a 
list of upcoming chamber functions and submitted material for the chamber 
newsletter, she says she never was demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't pressure anybody. And anybody who knows me well knows that I do not do 
that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing furor, Leamon said, has taken some of the shine out of her crown. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is a personality conflict, I think it's really bad that it's getting 
taken out on me," she said. "It's not hurting anybody but me. I'm the one 
that's being affected by it." 
</P>
<P>
Although the situation is emotionally painful, she said it does not affect her 
receipt of a $1,000 scholarship and actually has strengthened her resolve to do 
well at the June state pageant in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was to go to Miss California and do very well, I'm willing to bet when I 
came back, they'd really appreciate Miss Torrance-Beach Cities," she said. 
"This way, they get their cake and eat it too. If I do well, it's really 
positive publicity for them . . . and they're not giving us a thing in return."

CITIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO BAN BILLBOARDS, OFFICIAL TESTIFIES

Agoura Hills Councilwoman Fran Pavley, reflecting on her city's futile 
eight-year fight to remove 30 billboards along the Ventura Freeway, told a 
House subcommittee Thursday that local governments should be given the clout to 
banish unsightly roadside signs. 
</P>
<P>
Pavley testified before the House Public Works surface transportation 
subcommittee that the key impediment under the current federal law is a 
requirement that localities compensate billboard companies for removing their 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
The city or county must reimburse the owner for the sign's value as well as for 
the revenues that would be lost by dismantling it. 
</P>
<P>
This has allowed the firms, in effect, to set their own price, which can be as 
much as $100,000, Pavley said. Since 1982, the federal government has not 
allocated funds for such payments, leaving the costs to local taxpayers. As a 
result, the billboards often remain. 
</P>
<P>
"I am continually asked by local residents, 'Why can't you do something about 
those billboards?"' said Pavley, who was Agoura Hills' first mayor when the 
city was formed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't understand why the state and federal governments can regulate this 
undesirable land use within our city limits." 
</P>
<P>
Pavley was one of several witnesses who testified in support of a bill that 
would represent the first major revision of the Highway Beautification Act of 
1965, which limits billboards on federal interstate highways and roads but 
which critics say is riddled with loopholes.

Scenic America, a national conservation organization, maintains that the 
heralded law's inherent flaws and subsequent weakening amendments have rendered 
it ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"Without reform, America's traveling public will continue to be bombarded by 
visual blight and information overload," said Edward T. McMahon, Scenic 
America's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is the "billboard capital of the world," McMahon said. Residents on 
its traffic-clogged streets are exposed to 9,000 to 10,000 outdoor signs, with 
the heaviest concentrations pitching cigarettes and liquor in low-income areas, 
he added. A bill to ban new billboards in the city was narrowly defeated in 
1988 amid heavy lobbying by the sign industry. 
</P>
<P>
The pending federal measure would allow state and local governments to decide 
the terms under which existing billboards would be removed, eliminate the 
requirement that municipalities pay billboard companies to take down signs, 
place a moratorium on the construction of new billboards on federal highways, 
and prohibit the destruction of trees to improve billboard visibility. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is opposed by the politically formidable billboard industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the current legislation is working well," said Kippy Burns, an 
Outdoor Advertising Assn. spokeswoman. "You can't get much stricter than 
allowing each individual state to enact billboard controls . . . all the way up 
to banning billboards." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that Maine, Vermont, Alaska and Hawaii have banned roadside 
billboards. In addition, more than 500 cities either prohibited or restricted 
outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based advertising association represents 295 billboard 
companies, or 80% of the $1.6-billion industry. Nationwide, there are 390,294 
billboards on federal and interstate highways and an overall total of 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pavley, who was speaking on behalf of the National League of Cities and the 
League of California Cities on Thursday, said Agoura Hills banned new 
billboards in 1982. But it remains deeply frustrated over the otherwise-scenic 
3 1/2-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway where most of the 30 signs 
prominently advertise products or businesses outside the city's limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Courts have approved the use of zoning to relocate junkyards, cement 
factories, taxidermists, shelters, garbage dumps and other land uses," Pavley 
testified. "Today only billboards are being singled out for special protection 
by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Billboard opponents' efforts to pass stricter controls were defeated in 1987 in 
a House and Senate conference committee.

HIDDEN HILLS MAY CHALLENGE JUDGE'S ORDER ON HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Hidden Hills Planning Commission said the commission is not 
"intimidated" by a judge's order that city officials approve a plan to build 
lower-cost housing in the wealthy community. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Harvey A. Cohen came during the city's first public hearing on 
the merits of a controversial development proposal that includes a 48-unit 
lower-cost apartment building for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen is among four candidates challenging three City Council incumbents in an 
election next month, in which the housing proposal is the major issue. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. declared 
he is ready to order the Planning Commission and the town's City Council into 
his courtroom to ensure that they approve the housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettler's stand stems from his authority over the settlement of a 1984 
lawsuit against the city. The judge held that in the settlement, the city 
committed itself to building lower-cost housing within two years of annexing a 
site for the development project. The annexation took place last month. 
</P>
<P>
At the public hearing Wednesday night, the commission was reminded of 
Schoettler's position by Benjamin M. Reznik, an attorney for the project's 
developer, Danny Howard of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen responded: "I do not believe this community or this Planning Commission 
is intimidated by the lawsuit. We fully intend to take our time and do what is 
right for the community." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen told more than 50 residents, most of whom were opposed to the project, 
that the commission will not act before residents have full knowledge of the 
proposal, "whether it takes six months or six years." 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, this will not be rammed down anyone's throat" Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen and the three other commissioners present said they have not made up 
their minds about the senior housing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We all realize that this has to be thoroughly investigated," said Commissioner 
Jack Durrie, who added that the panel should also consider "what is legally 
appropriate." The final decision is the City Council's. 
</P>
<P>
The commission tentatively scheduled a study session for Monday, and another 
public hearing for March 29.

A top Oxnard school official has warned residents to beware of unauthorized 
telephone solicitations for contributions to pay for schoolbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Brekke, superintendent of the Oxnard Elementary School District, asked 
for a police investigation of the unauthorized solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
The pitch involves a request to contribute money to help buy coloring books for 
elementary school students, made in the name of a group called Californians 
Against Drugs, Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the group could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the district has not endorsed the project, Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that there is some considerable pressure to get these 
contributions," Brekke said. "A courier would come to the home within the hour 
to pick up the donation." 
</P>
<P>
The solicitations came to light when a number of residents called the district. 
Brekke had no information on how many contributors are involved. CAROL

JUDGE HEARS FINAL ARGUMENTS IN MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Murder -- Whatdunit." 
</P>
<P>
"The Perfect Crime." 
</P>
<P>
"The Anarchist's Cookbook." 
</P>
<P>
"The Joy of Cold Revenge" and "The Revenge Book." 
</P>
<P>
Why would someone have those books, books detailing how to kill without getting 
caught, unless they were going to murder someone, prosecutor Larry Burns argued 
during closing statements Thursday in the murder trial of David Scott Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison is accused of first-degree murder in the Feb. 17, 1988, killing of his 
ex-wife, Anne Jenkins, one month after she and her new husband, Gary Jenkins, 
won $727,000 in the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society rewards success," Burns said. "But there is one form of success 
for which this society has no reward . . . for the one who kills their victim 
and leaves no physical evidence." 
</P>
<P>
"That is the reward that David Harrison is seeking in this case for his success 
in murdering Anne Jenkins and leaving no evidence of his crime at the scene," 
said Burns, who concedes he has no evidence placing Harrison at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Alan May, in beginning his closing argument, accused Burns 
of playing "a shell game" with testimony. 
</P>
<P>
May also argued that Burns was trying to turn from the presumption of innocence 
to "guilty until proven innocent." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Burns is saying, '(Harrison) is trying to get away with the perfect crime 
and that's why we have no (direct) evidence. If you find him not guilty, you 
are rewarding him for the crime, so assume him guilty,' " May told the judge, 
who is deciding the non-jury trial. "But that's not the law." 
</P>
<P>
The defense will finish its closing arguments today, and Judge David B. Moon is 
expected to deliver a verdict immediately afterward. 
</P>
<P>
In Burns' closing, he detailed the stormy relationship between Jenkins and 
Harrison since their 1982 divorce: Constant court battles over custody of their 
two children and alimony, Harrison's bombing of the van belonging to Gary 
Jenkins' first wife, and Harrison's constant harassment of Jenkins, her husband 
and her father. 
</P>
<P>
"He indeed had a motive to kill Anne Jenkins on the day she was killed . . . 
and he alone had such a motive," Burns said, as Harrison sat, his head on his 
hand, eyes closed. "In this case, the motive was overwhelming . . . and that 
motive was (at its) pinnacle on the day she was killed." 
</P>
<P>
Burns said Harrison's actions between the time of their divorce and the killing 
demonstrated an escalation of violence against Jenkins and her family, and he 
maintained the surge followed the books on violence that Harrison owned. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with petty, sophomoric pranks, and it escalates to more severe 
things, to bombings," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Burns depicted the slightly built Harrison as "someone fascinated with murder," 
"an inveterate liar" and having "an insatiable desire . . . to punish Anne 
Jenkins . . . to beat down his wife." 
</P>
<P>
"The usual motives have been ruled out," Burns said, noting that there was no 
sign of burglary, robbery or sexual assault. "There is no explanation for this 
crime. If not David Harrison, pray tell, who did this?" 
</P>
<P>
Harrison had the means to kill, too, Burns contended, pointing out the 
collection of how-to books on committing crimes that Harrison tried to hide 
three days before the killing took place. 
</P>
<P>
Burns accused Harrison of trying to commit "The Immaculate Murder," a chapter 
in one of the books. 
</P>
<P>
"But he bungled it. He made aspirations to the perfect crime, but he made 
mistakes," Burns said. "He talked too much afterwards. He thought he was 
committing the perfect crime, but he failed." 
</P>
<P>
Burns pointed out that three days before the killing Harrison had told a good 
friend to "watch the news, something big is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"That is the most salient piece of evidence in this case, aside from the bag 
(of books on murder)," Burns said. "What was he predicting? What was going to 
happen?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's all consistent. The seeds that were sown four, five years ago came to 
fruition in February of 1988." 
</P>
<P>
In May's closing, however, he argued that by that time, the things that made 
Harrison hate Jenkins, the custody and alimony battles, had been resolved and 
Harrison had nothing to gain through the murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not just take the kids and run?" May said. "He may have wanted to kill her 
at some point. He may have talked about it at some point. But what did he have 
to gain?" 
</P>
<P>
"At the time of the killing, he probably had less motive for killing than he 
had in five years." 
</P>
<P>
May also said that motives for Jenkins' murder could be attached to several 
people.

Two men were in critical condition after their car crashed Thursday into a 
power pole in the 1300 block of Kelton Road, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, whose names were not available but who are believed to be in their 
20s, were taken unconscious to UC San Diego Medical Center and Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The car was "wrapped around (the) power pole and completely severed at the fire 
wall," a Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no fire and no one else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police the car was speeding when the driver lost control and 
slammed into the pole about 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred across the street from Johnson Elementary School, but school 
had already finished for the day. 
</P>
<P>
David Smith, an San Diego Gas &amp; Electric spokesman, said the accident cut 
power to about 100 customers for a few hours.

The Carlsbad Unified School District board of trustees has agreed to pay a 
suspended teacher's aide $10,000 in exchange for his immediate resignation, a 
district official said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Tirona also gave up all legal claims he might have against the 
district, including wages, benefits and future employment rights. 
</P>
<P>
Tirona was accused of selling steroids to three students in late 1988. His 
trial ended last month with the jury hung 11-1 for acquittal. He will not be 
tried again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a closed case right now," said Gerald Tarman, the school district's 
personnel director. "There's agreement on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Tirona on Monday and was subject to the board's 
approval Wednesday at a closed hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the board fired Tirona after a 30-day suspension. Wednesday's 
agreement frees the district from possible lawsuits by Tirona.

Bones found scattered in thick brush at the end of Big Rock Road in Santee may 
be those of a retired Navy man who disappeared in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner Robert Grubb said the human bones were found last week and that 
an initial examination by a forensic anthropologist has determined they 
belonged to an elderly male. He said investigators believe they may be the 
remains of Abe Pikelny, a retired Navy chief petty officer who went out for a 
walk on Sept. 25, 1987, and never returned home. Pikelny lived in a mobile home 
park on Mission Gorge Road with his sister about a mile from where the bones 
were found.

BOB HOPE'S 7,400 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some conservationists, suddenly turned Bob Hope bashers, would like the world 
to believe that Hope is a cheapskate, a miser, a Scrooge because he refuses to 
donate 7,400 acres he owns. 
</P>
<P>
Before anyone starts to believe such tripe, let me say, as one who knows, that 
no one has done more for genuinely charitable causes than has Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Ask any fighting GI of World War II or the Korean conflict. They will tell you 
what it meant to spend an hour or two away from enemy shelling to watch a Hope 
USO show on a jungle airstrip, the deck of an aircraft carrier, in a field 
hospital or an area a few hundred yards from the front lines. An untold number 
of American men can attribute their lives to this man of good humor for the 
needed morale boost he gave them that enabled them to continue to do the job 
they had to do. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the officials of hospitals and educational institutions which have received 
sorely needed financial support as a result of Hope's efforts. Ask officials of 
disaster relief such as those involved in a telethon in Baltimore some years 
ago for the benefit of victims of floods in the Eastern states. 
</P>
<P>
Hope has given his life to such activities -- activities to which he has given 
his time and talent, more often than not paying his own expenses. And many 
times, when local promoters of such events failed in their ticket-selling 
endeavors, Hope would buy the unsold tickets, sometimes hundreds of even 
thousands of them, out of his own pocket. I know, because for a few years my 
wife worked for Bob Hope Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Hope does not need me to defend him. There should be no reason for anyone to 
have to defend him. But, anyone who believes that Bob is a miser must have 
jelly for brains. 
</P>
<P>
If he's a Scrooge, then long live all such Scrooges!

LIBRARIES ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the game Password, one concept leads to another. If one player were to say 
"library," the other player would likely say "books." And if a player were to 
say "books," the other would likely say "reading." "Reading" might well lead to 
"writing" or "learning." President Bush -- who wants to be the Education 
President yet proposes a 71% cut in federal library funding -- apparently would 
not be a very good Password player. 
</P>
<P>
First Lady Barbara Bush has personally set out to increase literacy in the 
United States. You have only to hear her talk of her son Neil, who was dyslexic 
as a child, to know that Mrs. Bush's desire to improve learning opportunities 
for all children is sincere. In an apparent nod to Mrs. Bush's commitment to 
literacy programs, proposed funding for those programs actually increased by $3 
million. But, unfortunately, there's this incongruous matter of the rest of the 
President's library budget -- such as it is. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 1991 Bush budget would eliminate two crucial categories of public 
library programs. The public library services program, totaling $82.5 million, 
and public library construction funds, at $19 million, would be abolished. The 
Administration said that federal assistance in those areas are no longer 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the federal government plays only a supporting role to state 
and local governments in providing money for public libraries. But that does 
not make the federal contribution insignificant. It helps buy books and 
materials, supports book-mobiles to bring the gift of knowledge to remote or 
disadvantaged areas, and, of special interest in California, serves those who 
speak little English. 
</P>
<P>
Since Andrew Carnegie, in the early 1900s, looked ahead and realized the 
lasting value of the $50 million he gave to build libraries, government and 
citizen volunteers have managed to keep the "people's universities" open. But 
it has not been easy in recent years with severe cutbacks in local spending, 
despite broad-based private donations. That is why the proposed deep budget 
cutback sends the wrong message, and an ill-timed one at that. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time a President has tried to gut library funds. Because 
libraries have enjoyed strong bipartisan support, Congress again may come forth 
and save them from the executive budget knife. But Congress should not have to 
rescue public libraries -- not from the Education President.

BOB HOPE'S 7,400 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Park Advocates Pressure Bob Hope for Land Gift" (Part A, March 7), it 
stated that when Bob Hope views his land he sees it as a potential golf course. 
But when I look at his land in Corral Canyon, I see a place of beauty and my 
only real home. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in Corral Canyon, and as a boy I used to explore its cliffs and 
caves, untouched by mankind since the Chumash Indians first tread there. Now I 
live in the city, but my heart still remains in Corral Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hope plans to sell the canyon to Sun Pacific to build an exclusive country 
club. But how does one put a golf course, which must be fairly flat, into a 
canyon with towering thousand-foot cliffs? The plans are to move 5 million 
cubic yards of earth, equal to one and a half times the volume of the Great 
Pyramid. To Hope this may be one of the great wonders of the golfing world. But 
to those who love the canyon and places like it, the great wonder is why the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors would approve such a massive 
desecration of the land. The supervisors apparently favor this project so 
highly that they gerrymandered Corral Canyon out of the boundaries of the 
proposed city of Malibu, knowing that the vast majority of Malibu residents 
oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
The question remains, who should own a place of natural beauty such as Corral

BARBARISM IN IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any news correspondent sent to a world trouble spot knows that the work is 
risky. And from Central America to Lebanon, many reporters and photographers 
have paid the ultimate price trying to gather the news. But rarely, if ever, 
has a government methodically executed a foreign correspondent for doing his 
job. That's why it's appalling that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ignored 
international pleas for clemency and ordered Farzad Bazoft, a reporter for the 
London Observer, to be hanged Thursday on dubious charges of spying for Britain 
and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The facts of the case were never in dispute. Bazoft, a native of Iran with a 
British passport, had been in Iraq many times as an accredited correspondent. 
Late last year he was one of several reporters who tried to get to the site of 
a massive explosion at a military base south of Baghdad. Other journalists were 
turned back, but Bazoft got through by posing as a doctor accompanying a 
British nurse. While not approved of by most journalists, such ploys are not 
unheard of. And the fact that it was done for strictly journalistic purposes 
was evident in Bazoft's behavior afterward -- he filed his story and talked 
openly in Baghdad of his "scoop." 
</P>
<P>
After Bazoft's arrest, Saddam Hussein promised the British government he would 
get a "full and fair" trial. He got anything but. He faced a revolutionary 
court that heard no witnesses or evidence on his behalf. His newspaper was not 
allowed to send a lawyer to defend him. And there was no appeals process 
afterward. Bazoft was hanged a mere five days after being sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
Britain recalled its ambassador from Baghdad in protest of the execution, but 
may hold off on stronger action to protect British citizens still in Iraq, 
including the nurse who helped Bazoft in his journalistic ploy. She remains in 
prison. That's why the rest of the world must demonstrate its anger and disgust 
at this odious execution as firmly and loudly as possible. When reporters do 
their job, they can be troublesome. But their work is vital in any truly 
democratic and civilized society. By not commuting Bazoft's sentence, Saddam 
Hussein -- a leader whose most recent noteworthy achievement was "victory" in 
the long and bloody Iran-Iraq war -- raised new doubts about whether he and his 
government are as civilized as they claim.

Walter Annenberg donates $50 million to the United Negro College Fund. Bob Hope

IN THE LAND OF HUBRIS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latinos in Los Angeles are right to feel angry -- maybe even insulted -- at the 
County Board of Supervisors' refusal to immediately settle a lawsuit accusing 
the supervisors of discriminating against Latinos in drawing district lines. 
But they're not alone in their frustration. The hubris of the board majority is 
a vivid illustration of how ill-served are all residents by the current county 
government structure -- and why it must change. 
</P>
<P>
An impressive array of Latino political leaders, who don't always cooperate on 
other issues, appeared before the board this week to urge its members to "do 
the right thing" and settle the expensive and complex lawsuit out of court. The 
board was handed an unexpected opportunity to do just that when Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum decided not to run for reelection. With a powerful incumbent stepping 
aside -- and one with a large Latino population in his district, to boot -- the 
board could redraw district lines to give a Latino candidate an opportunity to 
be elected for the first time. That would render the lawsuit pretty much 
academic. 
</P>
<P>
To hardly anyone's surprise, board members Deane Dana, Michael Antonovich and 
Schabarum, who seems determined to leave office as ornery as ever, refused to 
deal. That means the lawsuit, first filed by civil-rights groups but later 
joined -- not insignificantly -- by the U.S. Justice Department, will grind on, 
costing thousands of dollars a day in attorneys' fees. If the county loses, 
local taxpayers could then have to spend millions more on possible appeals, all 
to protect incumbents against uppity outsiders (i.e. average citizens) who 
would dare to exercise their political prerogatives. 
</P>
<P>
Given the history of anti-Latino discrimination hereabouts, it is not at all 
unthinkable that the county could lose the lawsuit. Under the Voting Rights 
Act, that would give presiding U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon broad 
authority to change the system that caused the discrimination. In that event, 
Kenyon should take the opportunity to toss out an outmoded system that allows 
five white men to govern a diverse urban county of nearly 8 million people. Los 
Angeles needs a larger board of supervisors and an elected county executive, to 
better serve not only Latino voters and taxpayers but everyone who lives here.

CHOOSING TO LIVE MORE SIMPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dinosaurs were the dominant species on this planet for over 160 million 
years. They vanished virtually without a trace. Compared to that vast span of 
time, Homo sapiens' sojourn on Earth is less than the blink of an eye. 
</P>
<P>
And yet in the infinitesimal millisecond of our pitiful existence, we have 
brought our world to the brink of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Our technological evolution has surpassed our social evolution. We cannot 
destroy nature. But what we are doing is destroying ourselves. The planet will 
ultimately prevail. Only another species will be in the driver's seat. From a 
purely selfish viewpoint then, it's time to think of ourselves as "one planet 
-- one species." Then again, considering how we've botched things up, maybe 
it's time to give the job to someone else.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: SPICY COOKING FROM THE DESERT FINDS WELCOME NICHE 
BY THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a certain incongruity to dining on a cuisine inspired by arid New 
Mexico while sitting a few hundred yards from the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
This is 1990 and Southern California, however, and it may be readily 
understandable that Southwestern cuisine, trendy elsewhere for years if never 
widely popularized in San Diego, should finally blossom like some modest desert 
flower on the edge of Torrey Pines State Park. 
</P>
<P>
The fetishes and talismans of Southwestern cooking -- ancho chilies, black 
beans, tart lime as a substitute for lemon -- pop up regularly on the menu at 
Torreyana Grille, the rather overwhelming but attractive dining room at the new 
Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines hotel. The kitchen practices a highly stylized, 
hybridized brand of cooking, but one that also is quite clever, and 
exceptionally pleasing in the case of such dishes as seared lamb loin with 
eggplant marmalade and Southwestern-style crab cakes. 
</P>
<P>
It should be obvious immediately that crab cakes are not traditional in the 
desert Southwest. Such minor distinctions mean absolutely nothing in 
contemporary Southwestern cooking, however, because style and seasonings rather 
than ingredients determine this cuisine. In the case of the crab cakes -- or 
crab cake, because the dish is offered as an appetizer -- the distinguishing 
marks are the chili-warmed, subtly flavorful beurre blanc that underlies the 
butter-crisped patty, and the pyramids of spiced black beans arranged around 
it. The treatment is a happy one for the cake, which consists of virtually 
nothing but crab and is quite nicely done. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of beurre blanc, of course, adds yet another dimension to the 
cooking, in this case French. This is only natural, because French technique 
has allowed the creation of any number of hybrid cuisines, many of them 
qualified by the preface nouvelle. Strong Oriental overtones also find their 
way onto this menu (there is an appetizer of "Southwestern spring rolls," for 
example), and these fit quite well. As if all this were not enough, the kitchen 
also possesses a pasta machine, of which it makes much use, although the end 
results are merely starchy accents rather than anything that could be 
identified as Italian. Given the culinary confusion that could result from a 
union of too many styles, this is just as well. 
</P>
<P>
The crab cake is one of several appealing starters. The stuffed shrimp turn out 
to be a equivocation of that hotel dining room stand-by, shrimp cocktail, but a 
playful one; five fat prawns are stuffed with herbed cheese and arranged over 
twin sauces, one a fairly traditional tomato-based dip, the other suavely tart 
and sparkling with lime. The Southwestern spring rolls follow the classic egg 
roll format but substitute grilled chicken for the stuffing, and again are 
garnished with a pair of sauces, and there is even a "grilled" soup of smoked 
chicken, braised Guinea hen and vegetables in chicken broth. The Southwest is 
underlined by the offering of red chili fettuccine (the chili worked directly 
into the pasta dough) topped with grilled sausage, and by the gazpacho 
garnished with lime-seasoned sour cream. Like nearly every restaurant in town, 
Torreyana Grille offers Caesar salad, but unlike most, it makes a good one. 
</P>
<P>
The entree list is split between grilled foods, all priced at $16.95, and a 
higher-priced but more interesting selection mentioned as "signature items." 
This is a neat resolution to the problem always faced by hotel dining rooms 
that wish to attract a local clientele; the grilled choices include all the 
standards that hotels must offer, such as lamb chops, steaks, chicken and fish, 
while the "signature" dishes allow the kitchen to range more widely. 
</P>
<P>
The grills are, however, prepared in the style of the menu, and the choice 
includes such things as ahi with papaya salsa, swordfish in ancho chili butter, 
chicken breast with tomato vinaigrette and lamb chops in smoked tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen gives some thought to the "signature" dishes, and these sometimes 
are startlingly good. The pan-seared lamb loin, served as several slices over a 
bed of chopped, highly seasoned eggplant, was exquisite, both for the buttery 
texture of the meat and for the marvelous, highly professional brown sauce 
given a tantalizing edge by the addition of fresh tarragon. The squat, squishy 
"muffin" of buckwheat and pureed chanterelles that served as a most unusual 
garnish was an interesting idea, but one whose time has not yet come. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's special, a teaming of grilled scallops and shrimp with rice 
noodles in a sharp soy vinaigrette, was a brilliant evocation of Oriental style 
tailored to suit Western tastes. Black sesame seeds added a pungent undertone, 
but it was the sweetly vinegary dressing that really brought the dish together, 
and if the noodles starred, the shellfish were cautiously cooked and quite 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Other choices here include a combination of avocado and grilled lobster over 
black bean pasta, and pesto-basted guinea hen over roasted garlic linguine. But 
the most ambitious may be the "California" bouillabaisse, which is ladled from 
an elaborate, fish-shaped tureen over a bed of barley-sized pasta flavored with 
saffron. While ambitious, the dish also was perfunctory; the guest who ordered 
this grumbled that the melange of lobster, shrimp, scallops and fish in broth 
"lacked the fire and imagination of the first courses." Luxurious in its 
ingredients, it was rather timidly seasoned, and might have been happier as a 
soup than served over pasta. Table settings include bottles of herb-and-garlic 
infused olive oil, which servers pour out into small dishes and offer as a dip 
when they serve the good, house-baked breads. This is another of Torreyana's 
attempts at establishing a distinctive style, and if it seems just a touch 
put-on, it is pleasant enough. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen also bakes a good selection of pastries, including a mixed fruit 
tart that can seem rather soothing after the strongly seasoned entrees, and a 
chocolate pecan tart that rises a notch or two above the average. 
</P>
<P>
The decor matches the menu in its aggression. All the elements are strong; 
there is much marble, trimmed here and there with rich woods, and highly 
polished copper tiles add a brassy note. Because hard surfaces reflect voices, 
the place can be noisy when only moderately populated. Oddly enough, tables are 
set well away from the broad windows, and while everyone knows that you can't 
see the ocean at night, it would seem that guests at breakfast and lunch might 
appreciate getting a crack at the hotel's terrific view.

OPENING SET FOR PARK'S JAPANESE GARDEN; 
</P>
<P>
LANDSCAPE: AN IDEA THAT TOOK ROOT 20 YEARS AGO WILL BLOSSOM THIS SUMMER, WHEN 
THE FIRST PHASE OF A $11.4-MILLION JAPANESE FRIENDSHIP GARDEN IS COMPLETED IN 
BALBOA PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first phase of the long-awaited Japanese Friendship Garden in Balboa Park 
will open this summer, the garden's landscape architect said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 1/2-acre project, which has been contemplated for more than 20 years, is 
being built in five phases and will cost $11.4 million. The group sponsoring 
the garden, the Japanese Friendship Garden Society Inc. of San Diego, has 
raised $1 million so far to help complete the initial phase. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an outdoor ceremony on a spring-like day in the park, landscape 
architect Ken Nakajima told the gathering the first phase will be completed by 
July or August. Work began in January at the site on the rim of Gold Gulch 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Nakajima, who built a similar garden retreat in Moscow, was in town to consult 
with the joint construction team of Shimizu America Corp. and Nielsen 
Construction. Founded in 1804, Shimizu is the oldest and largest construction 
firm in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The entire garden should be completed in 10 years, said Larry L. Marshall, 
president of Japanese Friendship Garden Society Inc. of San Diego. Work will 
occur as funding becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said that "when we negotiated the 50-year lease with the city in 1984, 
we knew that it was unlikely (we could) . . . raise all the money to build the 
garden at one time. That's why we designed the garden in phases." 
</P>
<P>
The city has pledged to donate $2 million, and plans to turn over $500,000 in 
June, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the first phase are an exhibit room, a gift shop, snack bar, and an 
administration office. There will also be a sand and stone garden and a picnic 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a master plan, and the garden will continue to get better," he said. 
"The zoo has been around for more than 50 years, and it is still adding 
attractions. We will be second only to the zoo in attraction." 
</P>
<P>
The master plan for the garden was approved by the City Council in 1979. The 
garden has been named Sankei-en, which means a garden with three types of 
scenery. When finished, it will feature a pond surrounded by paths, pastoral 
and mountain retreat settings, a tea house, culture center, arbor and exhibit 
building. 
</P>
<P>
For all the anticipation, this is not the first time a Japanese garden has been 
built in Balboa Park. A tea garden, complete with a pavilion and a small tea 
plantation, was built for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition. This is the 
75th anniversary of the exposition. The garden was dismantled in the 1950s to 
make way for the Children's Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, the San Diego-Yokohama Sister City Society began to make 
plans to replace the one torn down. 
</P>
<P>
Gold Gulch Canyon was selected as the new site in 1968, and the Charles C. Dail 
Memorial Japanese Gate was erected just north of the Organ Pavilion. And until 
January, that was the last construction on the project. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the garden committee of the Sister City Society transferred control of 
the project to the new Japanese Friendship Garden board, which eventually began 
raising funds for the garden. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's ceremony, the San Diego chapter of Ikebana International, a 
nonprofit floral organization, donated $10,000 and the Kearny Mesa Rotary Club 
gave a $5,000 donation collected from five Rotary clubs in Japan.

GETTING SET FOR COUNT IN MINORITY AREAS

<P>
A cadre of volunteers will blanket the most densely populated minority areas of 
San Diego and National City on March 24 to encourage people to fill out their 
census forms. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going out into the trenches," said R. Daniel Hernandez, secretary of 
the Chicano Democratic Assn., one of the organizations participating in the 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers will go door to door to emphasize to people the importance of 
filling out the forms. They will be armed with flyers explaining how government 
money is allocated based on the census figures, and that the forms are 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said residents in the targeted Asian-American, African-American and 
Latino communities will be told "to trust (the census and) to sign the forms. A 
lot of the programs that help the community get their funding based on the 
census figures." 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of about 20 organizations active in the minority communities is 
behind the drive, including the Chicano Federation, the Union of Pan Asian 
Communities and the San Diego Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
Irma Castro, executive director of the Chicano Federation, said the groups 
banded together about two weeks ago and began developing the plan. So far they 
have mustered about 200 volunteers, who will work in teams as they go into 25 
census tracts in Linda Vista, South San Diego, Southeast San Diego, San Ysidro 
and National City. 
</P>
<P>
Because the tracts vary in population density -- some contain 15,000 people 
while others contain 1,500 -- Castro said she is hoping that more people will 
come forward to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to get 500 volunteers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It was concern about minority communities being undercounted that brought the 
groups together, Castro said. She said she had no estimate for the number of 
minorities in San Diego who were missed in the 1980 census, but that in Los 
Angeles the figures were put at 10% to 16% of the minority population. 
</P>
<P>
"While this is San Diego, you can draw a correlation. This is an urban, dense 
area with families in multiple dwellings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are afraid because they don't speak the language or they think 
that the census is the INS or the police," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the volunteers are bilingual, she said, and will help allay those 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in volunteering can call the Chicano Federation at 236-1228.

Tony Gwynn had just come into his house one recent afternoon when he flicked on 
the TV set, scanned a few of the hundreds of channels that his satellite dish 
provides and then started screaming. 
</P>
<P>
"I started flipping the channels, and I caught the big press conference just as 
everybody was walking in," Gwynn said. "There was the baseball commissioner 
(Fay Vincent), Don Fehr, (Chuck) O'Connor, and cameras and reporters 
everywhere. I started yelling, 'Alicia, Alicia, come here. This is it. It's 
over. It's over. We're playing baseball.' " 
</P>
<P>
Alicia, Gwynn's wife, came running into the sunken living room to see the cause 
of all this commotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's start packing, Alicia, they're going to end this thing right now," Gwynn 
yelled. "We're going to Yuma. We're going to Yuma." 
</P>
<P>
Before Gwynn began to pull everything out of his dresser drawers to pack for 
the Padres' spring training camp, he decided to stick around for a moment and 
watch this rousing conclusion to baseball's lockout. After all, he had already 
waited three weeks; what's a few more minutes? 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Gwynn said. "All of a sudden, I went from the feeling 
I had when we had our kids to the bottom of the barrel. It was the pits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Alicia felt like crying right along with me." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the commencement of spring training, the press conference revealed 
that the long winter was only going to get longer. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, baseball fans can go ahead and keep on thinking that they're the only 
ones suffering from spring training depression, saying how they could not care 
less now if owners and players choke on their greed. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, there's a good chance that those same folks have never met 
Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"What hurts the most is the sitting and the waiting," Gwynn says. "Right now, 
my whole day centers around ESPN, just waiting for the 4 o'clock show to see 
how negotiations are progressing. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd say this, but right now, I've lost a lot of enthusiasm. I 
just don't even feel like working out because I don't know when I'm going to 
camp. The fire's just not there. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get up in the morning each day, I think, 'Should I work out? Should I 
spend my time with my family? Or should I go see how our new house is coming?' 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I guess that's why I wouldn't be the right guy for the union, 
because I'd just do something so we could go ahead and play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, this is tough." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when baseball's public image is crumbling by the day, with the 
average salary soaring faster than the cost of housing in Southern California, 
with rehab clinics becoming as popular as Club Med vacations and paternity 
suits more common than traffic tickets, there is Anthony Keith Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Go ahead and call him Tony. 
</P>
<P>
If America needs a hero, take a good, hard look at this guy. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, that's him. You look at his silhouette, and you wonder what this guy's 
doing playing in the same profession as the Bo Jacksons and Dave Winfields of 
the world. Babe Ruth proved you don't have to be a candidate for Michelangelo's 
chisel, but when you look at Gwynn's physique -- 5-feet-11, 210 pounds -- it's 
difficult to believe you're looking at perhaps the finest hitter in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go on the road, nobody knows who I am," Gwynn said. "The only time 
people think I might be somebody is when I'm walking onto the team bus. But 
even then, I hear people saying to me, 'Hey, Garry Templeton. Hey, Bip 
Roberts.' No one outside San Diego knows who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when you're wearing tennis shoes, jeans, an open shirt, with no gold 
chains, carrying a brief case, it's little wonder autograph seekers think 
you're the club's traveling secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just an average guy," said Gwynn, who just a month ago purchased a '75 
Volkswagen bug. "I don't stick out like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"But really, even people who know me, really don't know me. They know me at the 
ballpark, and things like that, but I don't think people really know what I'm 
all about." 
</P>
<P>
Even most of Gwynn's teammates really don't know him outside the clubhouse or 
the baseball field. When the Padres traded away Greg Booker last June, Gwynn 
lost his last remaining close friend on the club. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to find too many guys on the road these days whose greatest pleasure 
after games is to head back to the hotel room, order a pizza, call the family 
and sit back in bed and watch movies or past games on a videotape. 
</P>
<P>
"We never needed much to entertain us," said Booker, who is now with the 
Chicago Cubs organization. "We'd just go back to the room and talk and rent a 
movie. Oh, sometimes we'd play cards, but that was about it as far as 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "Every now and then, I'll go downstairs and have a beer, but I'll 
always bring it right back upstairs. Guys talk about needing a beer after a 
game. Hey, if I need one that bad, I can go to room service and get one. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to get boxed, and I'll admit I occasionally do, I'll do it in my 
room and not bother anybody. Why make a fool of yourself in front of everyone? 
I don't have to hang around downstairs in the hotel bar just to feel like a 
part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
So, what happens when you get, uh, boxed? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it takes all of about two beers," Gwynn said, "and then I go right to 
sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, no one has told Gwynn that a four-time batting champion with a 
career batting average of .332 isn't supposed to be acting this way. 
</P>
<P>
He's supposed to tell reporters to shove off, not be the most accessible guy on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
He's supposed to tell autograph-seekers to meet him at card shows, not sign 
them before and after every game for free. 
</P>
<P>
He's supposed to tell the media how he doesn't read the papers and refuses to 
listen to sportscasters talk about him, not subscribe to four local daily 
newspapers and listen to the talk shows each night. 
</P>
<P>
He's supposed to be rude, obnoxious and arrogant, not act as if he's a rookie 
trying to make his first big league team. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it might sound crazy," Booker said, "but he's the exact same person 
he was when we were riding the back of the bus together at Walla Walla, making 
$600 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"He and his wife might be the most down-to-earth, good people I've ever known." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chris Gwynn, his younger brother, who plays in the Dodger organization: 
"He's nothing but a little kid. I tell him that all of the time. He's got the 
same friends he had in college. He's never going to change. I don't care how 
many batting titles he wins." 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Bip Roberts: "The thing about Tony, it's not an act or anything 
like that. He's genuine. He'll speak his mind, and speak straight from the 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter, one of the newest Padres who has known Gwynn since 1980: "I really 
don't think Tony will ever change. He's a special person. Now, if I can only 
get him interested in a couple of my basketball video games." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn hears the praise, the compliments and knows he's an easy target for every 
Padre public relations function that needs attending, but he laughs when he 
hears this talk of being flawless. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm not perfect by any means," he argues. "I curse, I dip (tobacco), I 
break bats when I'm mad, I do things other people do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I've never gotten a traffic ticket or anything." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so when was the last ticket you received? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let me see, it was in '86, no, maybe '85. I was speeding. Oh, I know, I 
was pulled over a few months ago because my fog lights were on and the police 
thought my high beams were on. I didn't get a ticket though, just a warning." 
</P>
<P>
Now you can begin to understand why Gwynn might be the best-kept secret in 
Corporate America. But this suddenly appears to be changing. 
</P>
<P>
It's incredible to John Boggs, Gwynn's agent, that it has taken this long for 
Gwynn to be discovered in the world of commercials and endorsements. He's 
intelligent, articulate, personable, and his baseball feats are outrageous, but 
there has always been one constant flaw. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn plays for the Padres and lives in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
And to most in Corporate America, San Diego is known as that area that's 
located somewhere between Japan and the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"Could you imagine if he played in Los Angeles, or New York," said Dick 
Graeber, senior vice president and chief operating officer of the regional 
Pepsi-Cola office. "People would go bonkers. Geez, if he was doing what he is 
for the Padres for the Dodgers, Yankees or Mets, it would be unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really a hidden treasure." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn has never been in a national commercial and until 1987 had never even 
been in any local advertisements. Of course, his integrity also has something 
to do with this. 
</P>
<P>
When Boggs excitedly telephoned Gwynn a month ago to inform him that Pepsi-Cola 
wanted him to endorse a drink called Mountain Dew Sport, Gwynn had just one 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to taste it," Boggs said. "It didn't matter what kind of money they 
were going to pay him, if he didn't like the taste, he wasn't going to endorse 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Tony. He knows his credibility is on the line, and believe me, we've 
turned down several things just because Tony doesn't believe in it." 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, when Gwynn was filming a commercial for a batting machine, 
the producer asked if he would drink a certain beverage while standing by the 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
Uh-uh. It might have helped project the All-American image, Gwynn said, but he 
wasn't about to be seen with a drink he doesn't even like. 
</P>
<P>
The Home Shopper's Network also called, asking him to appear for an hour on 
their show, making easy money while hawking baseball memorabilia. Everyone 
seems to be doing it. Pete Rose has been a virtual regular on the program and 
Hall of Famers have also been guests. 
</P>
<P>
Not Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't believe in that," Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been plenty of other capitalistic ventures that Gwynn has turned 
down, some literally because of his fear of flying. 
</P>
<P>
He has no choice during the baseball season, of course, and actually his 
teammates prove to be enough of a distraction so that he doesn't think about 
being 40,000 feet in the air. But when he's on his own, he'd much rather drive 
or take a train, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
It happened in the fall of 1984, just after the World Series. Gwynn was making 
a quick appearance in Visalia and that evening took a flight from Oakland back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I still remember it like it happened yesterday," Gwynn said. "I was sitting in 
the third row on the left side. We had a normal takeoff and everything was 
going fine. The guy next to me had just dropped down his tray table to do some 
work, and I was reading. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, all of a sudden, we just started dropping and dropping and dropping. 
People started screaming and yelling. I thought this was it, something was 
wrong with the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we stopped dropping, the guy next to me had me in a headlock. He 
apologized, and I said to him, 'Hey, if you hadn't done it to me, I would have 
done it to you.' 
</P>
<P>
"Just about when we were going to land, the pilot finally told us that we were 
headed for a mid-air collision, and that's why he did that. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, ever since that, I've been shaky. Real shaky. When I'm with the team, 
it's not too bad, but as soon as I feel that first bump, I'm grabbing onto the 
arm rests." 
</P>
<P>
The only other incident in Gwynn's life that scared him more occurred on May 
22, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It happened at 4:59 that afternoon. Gwynn said that for as long as he lives, 
he'll never be able to escape the emotional scar. 
</P>
<P>
It was the day that he filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Case No. 8703735. 
</P>
<P>
There were 44 creditors asking for $1,230,417.17. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn had only $690,150, leaving him more than $540,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most humiliating experience of my life," Gwynn said. "I lost a lot 
of money and a lot of nights' sleep over that. And I took an awful lot of 
public ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people anyway have the perception of athletes having furs and cars and 
jewelry, and now here's a guy who wasn't smart enough to handle his money. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a lot of hate mail, even some threats. I remember one guy, I'll never 
forget his name, wrote me this one letter ripping me apart. It had racist 
things in it and everything. And the thing about it, the guy signed his name 
with his address, phone number and everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so mad I called the operator, just to see if the name and phone number 
matched up. It didn't. You know, I really wanted to explain to the guy what 
happened. Of course, if I ever saw him, I'd probably kick him from here to 
Montana." 
</P>
<P>
Simply, Gwynn was a victim of trust, and perhaps naivete. Gwynn didn't even 
bother knowing the details of his investments, and trusted his agent, Lew 
Muller, a San Diego-based attorney, to such an extent that he gave him complete 
power of attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Muller, contacted in his El Cajon office, said: "I'd rather not rehash 
anything. I'd like to leave it in the past, as I'm sure Tony would." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn said he started to become suspicious in early 1987 when several banks 
started calling him on loans made to Muller. Payments were not being made. 
Since Gwynn was a co-signer, he was responsible. Once he realized the trouble 
he was in, he went over to Muller's home, took the Mercedes Benz for which he 
had co-signed and never contacted him again. 
</P>
<P>
At about this same time, Muller was being sued for $3 million by former Charger 
linebacker Mike Douglass. The charge: misrepresentation and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why," Alicia Gwynn said, "but I knew it was coming. I tried to 
warn Tony, but he thought I just didn't like Lew. The thing was, there were 
just so many holes, so many holes. He had Tony wrapped around his finger. You 
couldn't tell Tony anything, though, because he had so much trust in him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tony Gwynn: "You hire a guy, and you trust him, and three years later you 
find that he's taken you every wrong direction," Gwynn said. "I really wanted 
to get out of it myself, but I was so deep in debt, filing for bankruptcy was 
the only way out. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to be real slick about it, so reporters wouldn't find out, so we 
filed at 4:59 on a Friday. Well, right before the game, some reporter comes in, 
huffing and puffing, and asked me if I filed. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Well, obviously you know or you wouldn't have been running to my 
locker.' 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I could have hid, but I faced it all, every bit of it." 
</P>
<P>
It was Alicia, the woman who lived down the street from Tony growing up, and 
was his childhood sweetheart long before high school, who convinced him to file 
for bankruptcy. The decision was not so much for their sake, Alicia said, as it 
was for their two kids, Anthony (7) and Anisha (4). 
</P>
<P>
"If we kept trying to pay off all of our debts," Alicia said, "we would have 
been paying them off forever. We have children we have to think about, and 
their future was bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony kept worrying about me, but it was only hard in the sense that I had to 
hold Tony up, because I knew he couldn't get through it himself. And he kept 
worrying about what people were saying and thinking. I said, 'Tony, this was 
something that was done to us, we didn't cause this.' " 
</P>
<P>
These days, things are different. Gwynn knows exactly where every dollar is 
going. His wife is his business manager. His best friend, Boggs, is his agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure he'll ever get over it," Boggs said. "I think it will always be 
with him. Tony is a very proud man. The thing that hurt him the most was that 
he placed so much trust and confidence in someone, and he ended up taking the 
brunt of it. 
</P>
<P>
"The only good thing that came out of it was that he's young in his earning 
potential, and he learned a valuable lesson. Now, he's very hands-on. He asks 
questions. Everything, whether it be good, bad or indifferent, is run past him. 
</P>
<P>
But you want to know the craziest part of the whole episode? 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn never filed charges or even a lawsuit against Muller. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about it," Boggs said, "and he told me, 'What's that going to 
accomplish now? The guy's got nothing. So we send him to jail, so what? The 
guy's got a family, and I just can't do that to his family.' 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it?" 
</P>
<P>
It's because of this same loyalty and trust that Gwynn is so hurt by his 
contractual situation with the Padres. He's making $1 million this season, 
which according to the Player Relations Committee, will rank him behind about 
150 players, including six of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Gwynn knows he made the original mistake by signing a six-year, $4.5 
million contract in 1984, which became outdated two years later. And he 
compounded it by accepting a two-year, $4 million option in February 1988, that 
will pay him $2 million in 1991 and $2 million in 1992. The Padres have 15 days 
after the 1990 World Series to exercise the 1992 option. 
</P>
<P>
But considering what he has done for the organization, and that teammate Joe 
Carter is being paid $9.2 million over the next three seasons, why, he asks, 
should he be held to a contract that he has clearly outperformed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be lying if I said I couldn't get by with what they're paying me now," 
Gwynn said. "Of course I can get by. A million dollars is a lot of money. And 
the bankruptcy has nothing to do with this. I'm back on my feet now. 
</P>
<P>
"But I just want to be fair about this. I've never once asked for a 
renegotiation. They gave some money ($500,000) in '87 for what I did in the 
past, but it wasn't a handout, it was for my previous services. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, there's nothing I can do about it now. Hopefully, if I do my job, I'll 
be rewarded. If not, I'm not going to sit and pout about it. That's not my 
nature. I understand a contract's a contract, so what can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kapstein, who oversees the Padre operations, said that he and Padre owner 
Joan Kroc contacted Gwynn and Boggs last Saturday in a conference call to 
discuss Gwynn's contract for the first time. They talked for 45 minutes, but 
nothing changed. The Padres will continue to hold Gwynn to the same contract, 
and don't plan talking again until it's time for another. 
</P>
<P>
"The reluctance for them to do something is mind-boggling to me," Boggs said. 
"I'm just hoping that one day, they wake up and say, 'My God, what are we doing 
here? This is Tony Gwynn. This is Mr. Padre. Let's be fair to him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn's contract situation has made even a few of his teammates uncomfortable 
with their own. The night that Benito Santiago won a $1.25 million arbitration 
award, after only three years of big-league service, he apologized for making 
more than Gwynn. Carter, who's one of Gwynn's closest friends, even had a talk 
with him to make sure there were no hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony was a little upset at my contract, not at me, but with the organization," 
Carter said. "I just told him there's no way that I am better than he is, 
because he's one of the best players in the big leagues. I just happened to 
come along at the right time, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the opportunity to sign a long-term contract when he did, I'm sure I 
would have done the same thing. But no one gave me that chance." 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Gwynn's annoyance with his contract will only 
further increase his desire to excel this season, to show management up, but 
those who know him laugh at such talk. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn could be making $4.25 an hour, his friends say, and he'd still be at the 
stadium at 2 o'clock every afternoon taking extra batting practice and studying 
videotapes at home after games. 
</P>
<P>
"He puts as much effort into the game as anyone I've ever seen," said Padre 
Manager Jack McKeon, who has been around the game for the 40 years. "Do you 
know who he reminds me of? Brooks Robinson. Brooks was the best third baseman 
in the game, and there he was every day, taking 100 ground balls before each 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Tony, he just doesn't go out there and make it happen, he works his 
butt off. He puts so much pressure on himself to do well that you never have to 
say a word to him, and he just rubs off on everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, who became the first National League player since Stan Musial in 1950-52 
to win three consecutive batting titles, also laughed at talk of any further 
incentives. Sure, one day he'd like to make a run at .400, knowing that it 
would secure immortality. Yeah, and he'd sure like to win a Most Valuable 
Player award before his career ends. 
</P>
<P>
"But what I want, more than anything else, is a World Series ring," he said. "I 
want to be able to flash my ring like the other guys, show off with it." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn hesitated a moment, thought about what he just said, and laughed 
hysterically as if he just heard God's first joke. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, knowing me, I wouldn't even wear it, but it sure would be fun having it 
around the house, you know?" 
</P>

The Chargers' 41-38 overtime victory over Miami in a 1982 playoff was selected 
as the top NFL game of the 1980s by a panel of Hall of Fame voters. 
</P>
<P>
The game, played in the Orange Bowl, featured Miami's comeback from a 24-0 
deficit before the Chargers won on Rolf Benirschke's 29-yard field goal 13:52 
into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Second in the voting was the 1989 Super Bowl in which San Francisco beat 
Cincinnati 20-16 on Joe Montana' 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 
seconds left. The scoring pass came at the end of a 92-yard, 11-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
Another Montana drive was the feature of the third-best game, San Francisco's 
28-27 victory over Dallas in the 1981 NFC title game. It featured "The Catch" 
-- Dwight Clark's leaping six-yard TD grab at the end of the 89-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the top 10: 
</P>
<P>
4. Denver 23, Cleveland 20 in overtime in the 1986 AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
5. Denver 38, Cleveland 33 in the 1987 AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
6. Dallas 31, Washington 30, Sept. 5, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
7. Miami 38, Chicago 24, Dec. 2, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
8. Oakland 14, Cleveland 12, 1980 AFC playoff, Jan. 4, 1981.

Marta Figueras-Dotti of Spain and Nancy Rubin escaped afternoon winds and shot 
five-under-par 67s to share the first-round lead of the $300,000 LPGA Tucson 
Open Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Figueras-Dotti and Rubin were two of 14 players from the morning tee times who 
broke par 72. Only nine players from the afternoon group were under par while 
battling winds up to 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Rogerson shot a 69 for the low afternoon score. The other eight were all 
at 71. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Benz is one stroke back with a 68, and Becky Pearson is two back with 
Rogerson at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley carded a 70. A victory would make Bradley the LPGA's first 
$3-million winner. The 38-year-old is $34,357 short.

CALCAVECCHIA, MUDD PUTT WAY INTO LEAD

Mark Calcavecchia says he will pick up a golf tip at any time, even during a 
competitive round, if it will help him. 
</P>
<P>
So after missing a three-foot putt on his third hole Thursday in the opening 
round of the Players Championship at the Tournament Players Club in Sawgrass, 
Calcavecchia studied playing partner Paul Azinger's putting style. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I hit every putt where I aimed it," Calcavecchia said. 
</P>
<P>
So did Jodie Mudd, who had 11 one-putt greens and shared the first-round lead 
with Calcavecchia. Each had a 67, five under par, on a humid, slightly windy 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia and Mudd were pursued by David Graham and David Edwards with 68s, 
and 10 players were grouped at 69. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a hot putter," Mudd said. "My ball-striking was mediocre, and I was 
only even par for the first nine. But on the back nine I one-putted the 10th, 
11th, 13th, 14th, 16th and 18th greens." 
</P>
<P>
Mudd, who has won two tour events in a career that began in 1982, had six 
birdies, sinking three putts from 15- to 20-foot range. He had one bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the players complained that the greens were bumpy. They didn't bother 
Mudd, who played in the last group of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I scraped it around pretty good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd said that the course is one of the most demanding he has played, adding 
that the best player will eventually win. 
</P>
<P>
"Not anybody will do like I did for four days," he said, referring to his 
putting performance. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if there is pressure on him now, he said: "I'm not picked to win 
this tournament. That's for the big guys like Calcavecchia and (Greg) Norman." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia said he has used as many as 10 different putting strokes in one 
round. 
</P>
<P>
As for Thursday's change, he said he just put his hands farther down on the 
putter and hit down on the ball with a little pop stroke, emulating Azinger. 
</P>
<P>
Starting on the 10th hole, he had eight birdies and three bogeys. He got two of 
his birdies with spectacular shots. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia chipped in from 30 feet on the par-four, 395-yard 10th hole. Then, 
on the par-three, 172-yard 13th, he holed a bunker shot from 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old professional, who won the British Open last year, is known for 
his aggressiveness and long fairway woods. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he has always had a delicate touch around the greens and acknowledged it 
by saying, "You have to have a lot of touch and guts around the greens, and I 
think I have a little of both." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia has finished second three times this year and is second to Azinger 
on the money-winning list with $389,040. Yet, he says his game isn't really on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I played well today was because of my putting and chipping," he 
said. "I'm not hitting the ball like I want. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have your short game, you don't have anything." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia said he has never been successful at this stadium course, and the 
record bears him out. 
</P>
<P>
In three previous appearances, he finished no higher than 50th and missed the 
cut last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to play it smart and not force anything," Calcavecchia said. "I 
played more to the center of the green than I have in the past. Just get your 
two putts and get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
He finished on the par-five, 582-yard ninth hole, where he said he "smoked" a 
three-wood 275 yards to the front of the green. He chipped to within six feet 
of the cup and made his birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger matched par at 72, but Calcavecchia's other partner, Mark O'Meara, had 
a disastrous day. O'Meara shot an 84, 44 on his front side, and withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia said: "I'm happy I only have to play the 17th four times a year. 
You can conceivably hit a perfect shot and still get a triple or double bogey." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, mindful of his previous performances here, spent three hours on 
the driving range Wednesday, trying to correct a hook. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Australian-born David Graham, who will be 44 in May, said he had no explanation 
for playing so well. He has played a limited schedule in recent years and 
missed the cut at Phoenix in his only previous tour event this year. He said 
that he is involved in other things now, such as designing golf courses. When 
someone mentioned the possibility of his playing on the senior tour when he 
turns 50, Graham said: "I wish they would change the minimum age to 45. I don't 
think a player from 45 to 50 can realistically come out here and say, 'I'm 
playing to win.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tom Watson, 41, who has been struggling in recent years after being voted the 
player of the decade of the 1980s, doesn't agree with Graham. "I think 50 is 
the senior age. I don't think they should reduce it to 45," he said. "It works 
just fine the way it is. There is too big of a difference of a 60-year-old 
playing a 45-year-old." Watson shot a three-under-par 69 while playing with 
Greg Norman (71) and Fred Couples (69). 
</P>
<P>
"The start of the year was a downer for me," Watson said. "I missed the first 
three cuts." . . . Tom Kite, the defending champion, shot a 72, matching Curtis 
Strange. . . . Forty-one players broke par.

SAILING CONGRESSIONAL CUP; 
</P>
<P>
COUTTS TAKES LEAD WITH A 6-1 RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Zealand's Russell Coutts is in first place with a 6-1 record after two days 
of the 26th Congressional Cup at Long Beach, but he isn't smiling. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same water and same wind as when he won a gold medal in the 1984 
Olympics, but somehow it's not the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I've been feeling a little disoriented out there," he said after 
defeating four rivals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two basic differences come to mind. The last time Coutts, 28, was by himself 
sailing a Finn class dinghy against a relatively faceless fleet. This time, 
with a crew of six, he's up against some of the world's best match-racing 
sailors -- guys he'd love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
Mano a mano, a little killer instinct wouldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have to build a bit of hatred up when we're racing, which I find 
rather difficult to do," Coutts said. "I think I sail better when one of them 
does a dirty trick." 
</P>
<P>
They will probably get their chances before the event winds up Saturday. 
Certainly, Chris Dickson (4-3), who lost his first three races Thursday, would 
relish another shot at the man some might still regard as the other Kiwi -- at 
least until he matches Dickson's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
And so would Costa Mesa's Robbie Haines (5-2), who lost Thursday's final-race 
showdown to Coutts by seven seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to get through today's two races and into the semifinals among the 
top four skippers. This year the Congressional aligned itself with the world's 
other major match-racing series by instituting best-of-three sailoffs after the 
usual round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
Following a change from the format initially planned, the first-place skipper 
will select his semifinal opponent from the next three in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, who would Coutts really love to beat? 
</P>
<P>
One rival comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Coutts seemed to have a grip on the Hong Kong Cup when Dickson 
fought back desperately to gain the semifinals, won that, spotted Coutts the 
first race in the finals and then won two in a row to claim one of his six 
consecutive titles. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of as many as six more races has caused anxiety in the race 
committee to complete all the racing in only four days. That's why Thursday's 
four races were all shortened from twice to once around the one-mile, 
windward-leeward course despite good wind building from 5 to 14 knots. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the skippers didn't like sailing what amounted to drag races. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts a lot of pressure on the starts," said Dickson, who lost to Mike Elias 
(2-5) -- after performing a 270-degree-penalty turn for a prestart foul -- 
Coutts and Peter Isler (4-3) before beating John Kolius (2-5) to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
In a one-lap race, Dickson said, "There's not as much opportunity to pass -- 
which is fine if you're ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Coutts has hardly been behind in two days. His only loss -- to Bill Lynn (3-4) 
-- was the only race in which he failed to win the start, and the start was 
critical in his match against Haines. 
</P>
<P>
Haines was 5-0 and his crew was loose with laughter awaiting their next match 
against Kolius. But they lost to Kolius by 11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
That left them tied with Coutts at 5-1, and after a frantic 10 minutes of 
spinning and weaving their quick, agile new Catalina 37s through the spectator 
fleet before the gun, Coutts led Haines across the starting line by three 
seconds. More important, Coutts was on the right side of the course, commanding 
the right-of-way when they met on opposite tacks. 
</P>
<P>
Haines missed his best chance for a comeback the first time they met. Instead 
of ducking behind Coutts from port tack, he tacked to starboard under Coutts' 
lee bow and soon fell into Coutts' wind shadow and dropped another boat length 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have ducked him," Haines said. "We could have gotten to the right." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Coutts differed with most of the skippers, saying he liked the 
one-lap races. 
</P>
<P>
"We did against Robbie Haines, because he was gaining on us," Coutts said.

Oxnard Santa Clara, the defending champion in boys' Division IV, will headline 
today's opening of the state high school basketball tournament at the Oakland 
Coliseum Arena when it meets Northern California champion Fairfield Vanden at 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the first state tournament to have finals in all five boys' and girls' 
divisions held at the same site, four titles will be determined today and six 
more Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by Shon Tarver, a 6-foot-5 guard, Santa Clara, undefeated in 27 games 
this season, will attempt to win its 45th consecutive game against Vanden 
(29-3). 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, who was last season's State Division IV player of the Year, averaged 
36.3 points a game in the Saints' three Southern California Regional playoff 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' Division V final, El Cajon Christian (19-11) plays Northern 
champion Colusa (27-2) at 4:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' finals, Atherton Menlo goes for its second consecutive Division V 
title, playing Rosamond (21-7) at 2:30 p.m., while Santa Maria St. Joseph 
(28-3) meets Moraga Campolindo (23-11) in Division IV at 6:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Menlo (26-5) is coached by former Stanford quarterback John Paye, whose sister 
Kate scored 33 points against Sacred Heart in the Northern Regional final.

<P>
The most embarrassing thing that can happen to a team that feels it should have 
made the NCAA tournament is to play in the National Invitation tournament and 
lose in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
It happened to Southern Illinois Thursday night when Tony Bennett scored 26 
points to lead Wisconsin Green Bay to a 73-60 victory over the Salukis in the 
opening round at Carbondale, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay, an Assn. of Mid-Continent Universities member making its first 
postseason appearance as an NCAA Division I school, improved its record to 
24-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Salukis, the regular-season champions of the Missouri Valley Conference, 
finished 26-8. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State 83, Tulsa 74 -- Royce Jeffries scored 26 points to lead the 
Cowboys (17-14) at Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Shields and Lamont Randolph each scored 16 points for Tulsa, which 
trailed by 10 at the half and got within two during the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa (17-14) shot 37% from the field and was called for 32 fouls. Three of its 
five starters fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
Fordham 106, Southern University 80 -- Damon Lopez scored 24 points, grabbed 19 
rebounds and blocked nine shots in leading the Rams at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Fordham (20-12) also received outstanding performances from Andre McClendon 
with 23 points and Fred Herzog with a career-high 21. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Faulkner led Southern University (25-6) with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland 91, Massachusetts 81 -- Jerrod Mustaf scored eight points during a 
10-0 run in the second half to lead the Terrapins at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Mustaf led Maryland (19-13) with 23 points. Jim McCoy scored 22 for 
Massachusetts (17-14). 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii 69, Stanford 57 -- Chris Gaines scored 21 of his 24 points in the second 
half to lead the Rainbows at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines scored seven points during a decisive 11-2 run over a span of 4:06 that 
gave the Rainbows (24-9) a 65-53 lead with 4:33 to play. Sophomore Adam Keefe 
led Stanford (18-12) with 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Vanberbilt 98, Lousiana Tech 90 -- Scott Draud hit nine of his 22 points in 
overtime to lead the Commodores (17-14) at Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
The Commodores rallied from a 17-point deficit in the second half, and a 
12-foot jump shot by Draud tied the game, 80-80, with 11 seconds left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State 84, Baylor 75 -- Cameron Burns scored 28 points and Tony 
Watts added 23 from to carry the Bulldogs at Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Making its first postseason appearance in 11 seasons, Mississippi State (16-13) 
made a 10-2 run in the final three minutes of the first half to take a 39-30 
lead.

TORRID TORRANCE HITTER SPREADS LINE DRIVES LIKE SEEDS IN THE WIND;

<P>
PREP BASEBALL: ANTONE WILLIAMSON ALREADY HAS 12 HITS IN 22 TRIES AND 13 RUNS 
BATTED IN IN SEVEN GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Seeds. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Torrance High School's Antone Williamson calls the line drives he 
stings all over Torrance Park. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because I like to spread 'em all over the outfield," Williamson 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
It's what he does best. Williamson, a 16-year-old junior third baseman, is 
already one of the South Bay's most feared prep hitters. It's a young season, 
but Williamson already has 12 hits in 22 at-bats, including 13 runs batted in. 
In seven games. 
</P>
<P>
His secret? Williamson has a catchword for that, too. 
</P>
<P>
Yard ball. 
</P>
<P>
That's the game Williamson and his high school teammates play with wooden bats 
and tennis balls in Williamson's back yard in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The back yard is about 20 yards wide by 50 long, which makes for rather cozy 
confines. So Williamson and his Torrance teammates include the house next door 
as part of the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
The layout of the field makes for some bizarre rules. A ball hit off the 
neighbor's house remains in play, but if it's hit over the house it's a double 
play. A ball hit over the fence into the adjacent schoolyard is a home run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like 'arena' baseball," Williamson said. "But it's good for your 
hitting, your fundamentals. You have to hit the ball up the middle, so it 
forces you to keep your head down." 
</P>
<P>
If you're the pitcher in a yard ball game against Williamson, you keep your 
head down, too, lest you end up with a Spalding sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
The game is all right with Torrance Coach Jeff Phillips, who is reaping the 
rewards of Williamson's extracurricular batting practice. The Tartars, turning 
it around after an 11-15 record last year, have won six of their first seven 
games this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars travel to Cerritos for an 11 a.m. game Saturday in the Palos 
</P>
<P>
Verdes/Redondo Tournament. Cerritos handed them their only loss of the season, 
5-3, in the El Segundo Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance won again Wednesday afternoon, a 16-1 rout of Mira Costa. Williamson 
planted four seeds in Torrance Park's outfield -- two doubles and two singles. 
</P>
<P>
"If Antone gets less than two hits a game, it's either because they pitched 
around him or they caught the balls he hit," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, a sturdy 6-foot, 180-pounder -- he was the backup quarterback for 
Torrance's football team -- has a sweet left-handed swing reminiscent of a 
young George Brett. His powerful wrists allow him to crank up tremendous bat 
speed, and he has fence-clearing power to all three fields. 
</P>
<P>
And Williamson knows how to hit the alleys. Half of his base hits this year 
have gone for extra bases -- two doubles, two triples and two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
The first of Williamson's homers this season came in the first round of the El 
Segundo Tournament against Burbank Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
It was Williamson's third at-bat of the year; two Torrance runners were on base 
in a scoreless tie. Williamson produced a 400-foot-plus shot that soared over 
the left-center field fence in the deepest part of the outfield and boosted the 
Tartars toward their first victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach from Burroughs told me afterward that was the farthest ball he's 
seen hit in his park, ever," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson hit his second homer against Long Beach Millikan in the El Segundo 
Tournament -- a screamer into the right-center field gap that outraced 
Millikan's outfielders into the shadowy reaches of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for Williamson's -- and the team's -- early success is that 
Williamson, batting third in the Torrance lineup, has solid hitters surrounding 
him. Right fielder Eric Gonzalez, who was on the junior varsity last year, is a 
legitimate power hitter and bats cleanup. Bryan Mullings, Torrance's shortstop, 
hits in the second spot and homered Tuesday in a 7-4 victory over Miraleste. 
</P>
<P>
But being exposed in the Torrance lineup last season didn't hurt Williamson's 
numbers any. 
</P>
<P>
He still hit .463 with four homers and 36 RBI as a sophomore. He struck out 
only five times in 82 at-bats, mounted a staggering .768 slugging percentage, 
and was selected to The Times All-South Bay and All-Southern Section 5-A 
Division teams. 
</P>
<P>
He was 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference this year is Williamson's defense. He was moved from 
shortstop to third base as a freshman and made only two errors at the position 
that season. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, Williamson made seven errors in 26 games, most of them by 
overthrowing first base. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson says he has pinpointed the problem over the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit by puberty," he said. "I hadn't gotten used to my body yet. So I was 
overthrowing it. Way overthrowing it." 
</P>
<P>
This year is a different story. Williamson has improved markedly on the hot 
corner, and while he has always possessed a slick glove and good range, he now 
throws to first base with telling accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
College and professional scouts are coming out early to take a look at 
Torrance's prodigy. Phillips already has "a big old stack of cards" from scouts 
in his desk. 
</P>
<P>
"The way he's been hitting the ball, he's bound to impress people," Phillips 
said. "We're getting all kinds of scouts coming around, and they're looking at 
him." 
</P>
<P>
One scout on hand Wednesday at Torrance Park left the grandstands with a smile 
and a catalogue full of notes. 
</P>
<P>
Art Schuerman, a seasoned Los Angeles-based scout for the Milwaukee Brewers, 
considers Williamson one of the top juniors in his entire territory, which 
stretches from Huntington Beach to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got two real good tools right now," Schuerman said. "His arm and his 
hitting are particularly advanced at his age. He doesn't run that good, but 
then again he doesn't run that bad, either." 
</P>
<P>
Schuerman is more correct on the second count. Williamson already has four 
stolen bases this season. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Schuerman and the legion of professional scouts who are bound to line up 
over the next couple of years for a peek at Williamson will probably have to 
wait their turn. 
</P>
<P>
A lucky college could snare him first. Williamson is a bright and serious young 
man who recently handed Phillips a progress report with five A's and one B on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He has his heart set on a business degree after high school, at a college close 
to home -- "possibly in the Pac-10," Williamson said. He says a professional 
baseball career can wait until after college. 
</P>
<P>
"Antone is really a great kid," Phillips said. "More often than not, the 
package isn't always as complete as it is with him. And he's never going to 
change, either. Antone will always be Antone." 
</P>

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: SADDENED CHRIS KNIGHT TAKES HANK'S SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Chris Knight, this is the night. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount sophomore is the player who will step in for Hank Gathers 
at center when the Lions play their NCAA opener against New Mexico State at 
Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, a slender 6-foot-9 player known to teammates as "Blade," reacted so 
emotionally to Gathers' death March 4 that he declared last week that he would 
never play again after this season. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of this week, he had backed off a bit from that statement, saying 
he had not made a decision. But Knight clearly feels some weight on his 
shoulders, at least psychologically. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I'll decide later on. (Now) it's business as usual," he said. 
"I haven't put any pressure on myself. I'll do what Hank always told me to do 
-- work hard." 
</P>
<P>
Knight said he reacted so strongly last week because he had been waiting so 
long for Gathers to graduate and open up a position. Knight was one of the 
first players at the hospital after Gathers collapsed in a game against 
Portland, and he was one of the first to know when Gathers was declared dead. 
</P>
<P>
Knight was one of Gathers' pallbearers this week, and in a way the flight to 
Philadelphia for the funeral was a guilt trip. "When it first happened, I was 
feeling guilty because I used to say, 'I can't wait till Hank leaves,' " Knight 
said. "I felt like I wished it on him. I don't know what I'll do after this." 
</P>
<P>
Knight filled in capably when Gathers fainted in December and missed several 
games. As the team's tallest regular player, Knight is the best shot blocker 
and plays with a free-spiritedness that fits Paul Westhead's system well. 
</P>
<P>
"The role will probably be hard for him emotionally," Westhead said. "He 
probably sees himself as Hank's replacement. It's not an enviable spot to be 
in. But his game's the same. Really, we'll have to rely on four or five fellows 
to play for us. He doesn't have to be concerned (with pacing himself). We 
encourage the reckless abandon." 
</P>
<P>
Knight's biggest problem at Loyola has been a tendency to pick up quick fouls. 
"It's a different approach when you're starting," Knight admitted, "but the end 
of the season I wasn't having as much foul trouble, so I'm not concerned about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Knight, who was painfully slender as a redshirt freshman, has bulked up 
somewhat. "When he came he was 135; now he's up to 140," Westhead quipped. 
Knight is listed at 180 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
At least this week, he's looking forward to returning to the hardwood. "This is 
like medicine for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Tom Peabody said: "I have all the confidence Blade can get eight or 
nine boards." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Loyola Marymount cheerleaders -- official and unofficial -- greeted 
the basketball team when it arrived home late Monday night from Hank Gathers' 
funeral in Philadelphia. The fans chanted "L-M-U" and handed flowers to the 
players as they entered the terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. The 
largest cheers were for Bo Kimble, now clearly the focal point of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nice," said one Loyola assistant coach. "That should help pump the guys 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Said Peabody: "It shows what a big family it is here." 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount campus radio station, KXLU-FM, will broadcast a half-hour 
tribute to Gathers starting approximately an hour before tonight's 8:45 
tip-off. Student announcers Brian Berger and Keith Forman, who have broadcast 
every Loyola game this season, prepared the program. They will also air their 
usual pregame analysis with Bo Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: Hank Gathers finished his college career with 2,723 points. 
Bo Kimble goes into tonight's game with 2,207 career points. Pepperdine's Tom 
Lewis finished his career with 2,050 points. The three were in the same 
recruiting class at USC and may be the only threesome recruited together to 
score more than 2,000 points each. 
</P>
<P>
The hot Loyola Marymount baseball team, which has won seven of its last eight 
games, will open a three-game West Coast Conference series today against the 
University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, 16-7 on the season, are in first place in the WCC at 6-2. USF, which 
has had injury problems, is in last place at 1-8. The Dons' season record is 
6-12. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are paced by the hitting of Rick Mediavilla at .404. Tony Kounas, 
hitting .362, tops the team with 26 runs batted in, while Miah Bradbury and Tim 
Williams have 23 apiece. Left-hander Jon Willard leads the pitching staff at 
6-1 with a 3.64 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
The teams play at 2 p.m. today, then have an 11 a.m. double-header Saturday. 
The Lions close out their home stand Tuesday with a 2 p.m. non-conference game 
against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills' Fred Camarena entered the week leading the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in hitting at .443. He's in a tight race 
with UC Riverside's Pete Weber at .442 and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's Doug Noce 
at .421. . . . Deanne Yanai, a senior at Torrance High, earned All-Bay League 
basketball honors in leading the Tartars to a 16-11 record. She's the daughter 
of Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave Yanai.

CANYONS BEATS OXNARD, 7-3, TO RETAIN SHARE OF SECOND PLACE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: COUGARS OVERCOME FIVE ERRORS AND 2-0 FIRST-INNING DEFICIT. 
</P>

<P>
The first five batters reached base against College of the Canyons starter Mike 
Teich, but Cougar Coach Len Mohney wasn't worried about falling behind by two 
runs in Thursday's Western State Conference baseball game against host Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing this all year," Mohney said. "We've got something like 23 
freshmen on the roster and at times it shows. But I thought we were in pretty 
good shape after making all kinds of mistakes in the first and only trailing by 
two. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured the rest of the game would be easy after that." 
</P>
<P>
Mohney figured correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons defeated Oxnard, 7-3, to stay a half-game behind first-place Moorpark 
(6-1) in the WSC standings, and set up a second-place showdown Saturday 
afternoon with Cuesta, which remained tied with the Cougars at 5-1 after 
defeating Bakersfield, 12-5. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons committed five errors -- two in the first, two in the fourth, and one 
in the eighth -- but Teich and Jason Farrell combined on a five-hitter as 
Cougars improved their overall record to 13-6. 
</P>
<P>
Teich, who forced a runner at home and struck out two to end the first, allowed 
four hits, and three runs (one earned) in eight innings. He also struck out 
four, walked three and hit one batter. 
</P>
<P>
And the Cougar offense, which stranded at least one runner in each of the first 
eight innings, scored three insurance runs on Steve Kovacic's home run in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up two runs on one hit in the first, Teich retired the side in the 
second and third and would have done the same in the fourth if not for errors 
by shortstop Charlie Fowlks and second baseman Kovacic. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 2-1, after three innings, the Cougars scored twice in the fourth to 
take a lead they would never relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
Kovacic (two for four, three runs batted in and three runs scored) walked with 
one out, went to third on Jon Beauchemin's bloop single to right field and 
scored on Mike Stephenson's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Horvat drove in Stephenson with a double off the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we got out of the first, I figured Mike would be OK," Mohney said. 
</P>
<P>
With Teich limiting the Condors (9-11, 2-4) to a double and single in the 
fifth, sixth and seventh, Canyons extended its lead to 4-2 with a run in the 
eighth, then reverted to its defensive problems in the bottom half of the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's Pat Avila reached first on third baseman Beauchemin's error to start 
the inning, went to second on a passed ball, took third on a sacrifice fly by 
Tim Johnson, and scored one out later on Al Anaya's single. 
</P>
<P>
Teich walked Juan Benavidez, but Manny Mejia flied out to end the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons scored three runs in the ninth to take some pressure off its pitching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlks and Gary Morgan led off with consecutive singles, and, after Chris 
Vasquez flew out and Junior Trujillo forced Morgan at second, Kovacic hit his 
three-run shot that bounced off the top of the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally executed in the ninth," Mohney said. "You win baseball games by 
playing defense and hitting in the late innings. . . . I know that's an 
overused cliche, but it's true." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan and Beauchemin each had two hits for Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
John Brookman (6-2) took the loss.

VANDEN STANDS BETWEEN SANTA CLARA AND TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Division IV high school basketball final tonight at 8 at the Oakland 
Coliseum arena between Santa Clara and Vanden matches teams with similar styles 
and rich traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (27-0) is the defending Division IV champion and boasts a 44-game 
winning streak. Lou Cvijanovich, the Southern Section's winningest active 
coach, has demanded toughness and solid fundamentals for 32 years. "My team 
reflects my hard nose," said Cvijanovich, whose career record is 624-202. 
</P>
<P>
Vanden (28-3), which won a state title in 1986, is equally scrappy under Coach 
Jim Boyd, who is in his 26th season. "You'll like the way our kids play defense 
and dive for loose balls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The matchup would be even except for one factor: Santa Clara's All-American 
guard, Shon Tarver. 
</P>
<P>
Even on Travis Air Force Base in tiny Fairfield, Calif., where Vanden is 
located, Tarver is renowned. 
</P>
<P>
"He stands alone. You'd have to have your head in the sand not to have heard of 
Shon Tarver," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, a 6-foot-5 senior who averages 32 points a game, is a cinch to repeat 
as Division IV Player of the Year. And if he plays at the level he has 
established throughout the playoffs, Santa Clara is a cinch to repeat as 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on a mission right now," Tarver said. "Nothing will sidetrack me." 
</P>
<P>
A tenacious defense and Tarver's ability to score from anywhere on the court 
have made Santa Clara's journey to the final a carefree ride. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints' average margin of victory is 23 points. They defeated Verbum Dei, 
76-48, to win the Southern Section 2-AA title March 3 after taking a 31-8 lead 
midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara's closest game in the Southern California regional was a 91-65 
victory over St. Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Bruce Howarth, an adept ballhandler, and 6-6 center Anthony 
Zuiraitis each average 10 points for Santa Clara. Junior Tony Maestas and 
sophomore Chris Cole are the forwards. 
</P>
<P>
Vanden's top player is 5-9 point guard Danin Bryant, who averages 21.7 points 
and 7.1 assists. Jim Allen, a 6-5 sophomore forward, has averaged 19.7 points 
during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Junior off-guard Rod Parrish has drawn the unenviable task of covering Tarver. 
Boyd said that his team will use no special defense to try to contain Tarver. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll play straight up," he said. "Multiple zones and man-to-man." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara also knows defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is our strong suit," Howarth said. "I hope we play man defense after a 
made shot and zone after a miss. That really confused Verbum Dei."

Lawyer Jokes: Imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker, serving 45 years in a federal

Hendersonville, N.C., last week to share some humor. "He asked me if I knew 
what they call 20,000 lawyers at the bottom of the sea," Toms said. "Then he

Gift Book: A previously unknown manuscript by the late Orson Welles will be 
auctioned March 22 at Swann Galleries in New York. The illustrated book, for 
sale by Welles' daughter, Rebecca, was her gift for Christmas, 1956, when she 
was 11 and lived with her mother, Rita Hayworth. Welles wrote "The Bravades," 
an account of a French medieval pageant, as a way "to keep in touch and tell me 
how much he loved me," Rebecca says. "The gift was that much more precious 
because I didn't spend much time with him."

No Change: A nephew of U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is trying to persuade a Houston 
transsexual convicted of murder to step down from a runoff election for party 
chairman and let him accept the post. Leslie Elaine Perez won 27% of the 
ballots for the Harris County post Tuesday, running second to Ken Bentsen Jr., 
who won 42%. Perez, 52, a real estate investor, was convicted under the name of 
Leslie Douglas Ashley in the 1961 death of an insurance salesman and was 
paroled in 1971. Ashley then underwent a sex-change operation. Bentsen met with 
Perez on Wednesday. She said she would not withdraw.

GENERIC NOVEL WITH A FAMILIAR PLOT;

Though you may not find this story in your tattered copy of "100 Sure-Fire 
Plots," it's bound to be in the revised and updated edition, used by thousands 
of satisfied authors; reviewed by smaller numbers of patient critics -- 
smaller, because most of us have read at least 100 variations of "Starting With 
Serge." What we have here is the generic novel of the last three decades, in 
its most fundamental form. 
</P>
<P>
The narrator is Julie Stark, precocious daughter of Herschel, a man risen from 
humble beginnings to affluence. Though the novel begins while the family still 
lives in New York's Washington Heights, they soon move to the suburb of Luna 
Island, a posh enclave that immediately disappoints them. 
</P>
<P>
Julie's mother, Thea, dutifully goes to a PTA meeting, only to announce after 
her first exposure that "it's not for me." Father Herschel joins the Kiwanis 
club; he buys a set of golf clubs and a barbecue, but none of these bucolic 
diversions turn out to be for him, either. 
</P>
<P>
Every Friday night, Thea meets her husband in The City for diversion, returning 
to the island with bags of delicatessen. "When I'd ask how the old neighborhood 
was, they'd say 'Horrible. Horrible then and horrible now.' But they kept going 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The year is 1959, a time frame that provides Julie with a generous supply of 
squareness to excoriate. When her sister Madelyn comes home from college in the 
midst of her first semester after a minor nervous breakdown (that term was 
still current), the entire Stark family eagerly embarks upon psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
The guru is Serge, a Russian emigre shrink recommended by sophisticated brother 
Wolf, whose wife and two daughters also are being treated by him. Though Serge 
bears an uncannily close resemblance to Rasputin, the Starks have little in 
common with the Romanovs, except for their geographical origins. Even so, they 
fall under Serge's spell in exactly the same way as the Czar and Czarina, 
believing absolutely in his ability to work wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Madelyn stops "acting morose," loses weight and takes courses at NYU. Thea 
registers at the New School and broadens her horizons by reading Swift and 
Conrad. When family tensions become unbearable, Serge is called, and "the 
yelling would stop, and my father would look content." Herschel was only a 
phone patient, but soon young Julie becomes a full-fledged analysand, visiting 
Serge for preventive therapy the year she enters a new private day school. 
</P>
<P>
She's enchanted. Serge is her passport to maturity. "When I turned, Serge was 
standing in the doorway, a man in his mid-60s, looking nothing like Moses and 
everything like Charles Laughton in his Henry VIII period. . . . What can I do 
to help you? he asked." 
</P>
<P>
For the next quarter of the book, Julie tells him at considerable length, a 
useful device that allows her to fill us in on the trials of growing up on Long 
Island in the early '60s: girlish crushes, sexual awakening, alienation from 
mother, adoration of father -- the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this period, Julie is becoming stunningly attractive and amazingly 
worldly for her years. By the time she's 15, she's invited by Serge for a 
weekend at his summer house, proving conclusively that she can hold her own 
with a gaggle of European intellectuals who sound like send-ups of Sartre and 
De Beauvoir in the Deux Magots cafe. 
</P>
<P>
"Men mistake their fears for reality and call this the world. Women are right 
to be mistrustful." During this epochal weekend, Serge reveals himself for what 
he is -- a dirty old man -- but Julie never tells anyone until 1980, when Part 
II begins. 
</P>
<P>
Julie is now a painter, the jaded veteran of several love affairs. Madelyn has 
pulled herself together and become a tycoon, owning a chain of pizza shops, in 
which her retired parents work until Herschel's grueling death. After this 
event, Julie calls upon Serge's old friend Wildeweiss, whom she met at the 
house party 20 years earlier. "I want to talk about Serge," she says, and he 
promptly turns over a cache of letters to her. 
</P>
<P>
Reading these, we become even more ambivalent about Serge than does our 
narrator, but then, he wasn't our first Serge, not by a long shot.

FYI: UNCOVERING HOODED SWEAT SHIRTS 
</P>

It's a look Madonna wears; it came from the streets of London, and it works for 
him as well as for her. It's the hooded sweat shirt, worn under the dressy or 
the denim jacket. 
</P>
<P>
The standard athletic supply company sweats aren't the way to go here because 
the fabric is too bulky to put under most jackets. The designer boutiques don't 
necessarily have the perfect answer either. They do carry the newest, 
form-fitting hooded sweat shirts, but the prices are much more than $100. 
</P>
<P>
American Rag Compagnie offers one possible solution: a short-sleeve, 
solid-cotton, hooded T-shirt in white or black for $39.75 (pictured here). 
Aside from the price, it's also got the climate control you need to pull off 
the look in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Contents by Theodore in the Beverly Center has a lightweight cotton velour 
style in white, green, red, black, gray or navy, for $155. Also available, for 
$135, is a Joan Vass single-gauge, cotton-knit, hooded shirt with a five-inch 
zipper that unzips to create a V-neck. 
</P>
<P>
At Traffic for men in the Beverly Center, there is a rayon wool gabardine 
hooded vest in fuchsia by English designer John Richmond. It pulls on over the 
head but has classic vest details, including those little adjustable belts on 
the sides; price: $210. Richmond takes the hood 'n' jacket so seriously he 
combined them in a navy blue pinstripe, single breasted, wool gabardine jacket 
with a cinnamon brown satin, zip-in hooded dickey. The two-in-one jacket, at 
$648, is also available for women at Traffic Studio. JOANNA DENDEL

When six former Miss Americas joined Debbye Turner, Miss America 1990, at the 
May Co. this past Tuesday for a "Made in U.S.A." fashion show and to announce a 
May Co. $10,000 scholarship program for young women, the talk naturally turned 
to the beauty secrets of the tiara wearers. Jean Bartel, Miss America 1943, 
said she relies on lanolin for her skin. "You can buy it in a big jar at 
Rexall, and it only costs about eight bucks." Mary Ann Mobley (1959) sees 
surgery in her future: "One day I'll go to the plastic surgeon and tell him to 
start at my feet and work his way up." As for 24-year-old Turner, a veterinary 
student from Missouri, she confessed she never wears makeup at school and hangs 
out in her blue jeans, sweat shirt and "Sylvester putty tat" slippers.

LAMBADA FIX: Tonight the new Cannon Pictures film "Lambada" opens. And if there 
is anyone out there who thinks she simply cannot live another second without 
one of those short and sassy twirly skirts and sexy little tops, then remember 
this number: (212) 879-4810. It's the direct hot line to the Gilda Marx 
boutique, home of the Lambada dresses made for the movie. Marx is taking custom 
orders for the separates that retail for $30-$50 from dancers desperate to show 
their stuff.

you to visualize the new svelte you through their New Image Weight Loss System. 
Dieters find the company's computer-generated "before" and "after" pictures to 
be great motivational tools. Nutri-System Weight Loss Centers is trying the

NECK TIED: The newest neckwear is a gift wrap. East Coast teens have been seen 
wearing necklaces made from the package ribbon from designer boutiques. Their 
favorites are Hermes, Chanel, Benetton and Christian Dior. In New York City the 
girls have taken to asking for the ribbon gratis, but Listen learned that it is 
in such short supply at the Chanel boutique in Beverly Hills that the store 
can't spare any for customers who don't make purchases. The situation is 
equally desperate at Fred Hayman Beverly Hills, where the store has been 
besieged with requests for ribbon, says Valerie Seres, manager of the women's 
department.

'melissasomething' Spinoff?: Melanie Mayron, who plays Melissa on 
"thirtysomething," may spin off onto her own half-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Hollywood Reporter, the show would air next spring. Ed Zwick 
and Marshall Herskovitz, "thirtysomething" executive producers, as well as 
Mayron, would be involved in producing. Sources say the story line would 
probably have Melissa taking off for another big city and trying to make it as 
a photographer. BETH KLEID

Kline Apologizes to Stutterers: Kevin Kline apologized to the National 
Stuttering Project this week for offending stutterers with his Oscar-winning 
role in "A Fish Called Wanda" about a year after he was asked to make a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I apologize for the pain I might have inadvertently caused persons who 
stutter. The character I portrayed in 'A Fish Called Wanda' should not be 
considered a role model for any civilized person when talking to a stutterer," 
Kline wrote in a letter to the group. Kline has resisted an apology because he 
said the organization missed the humor in his role. BETH KLEID

Hurricane Hugo earned top honors Thursday in the 50th annual Peabody Awards, 
called the Pulitzer Prize of broadcast journalism. The University of Georgia, 
which governs the awards, cited KCBS-AM radio and KGO-TV, both in San 
Francisco, for coverage of the earthquake and WCSC-TV in Charleston, S.C., for 
reporting on Hurricane Hugo. Other recipients included CBS Radio News in New 
York and Cable News Network in Atlanta for coverage of last spring's uprising 
in China. BETH KLEID

'NUNS ON THE RUN': A COMEDIC AND RISQUE CHANGE OF HABIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As drag comedies go, "Nuns on the Run" (selected theaters) has some bawdy class 
-- but only because of its casting. Beanpole Eric Idle and boar-stout Robbie 
Coltrane, poured into nun's habits, make a traffic-stopping pair of female 
ecclesiastics. Coltrane alone has legs that could halt a charging rhino, prompt 
a papal bull. 
</P>
<P>
Trapped in a convent-sanctuary with millions in stolen swag and two separate 
mobs on their tail, they're like bears on their best behavior trying on 
lingerie. As they mince and genuflect their way through a murderous maze of 
killers and cross-plots, the wimpled, dimpled boy-o's radiate such nervous 
irreverence and brash daintiness, they often slide right past their weak, 
obvious material. 
</P>
<P>
Idle plays Brian Hope, alias Sister Euphemia of the Five Wounds, and Coltrane 
plays Charlie McManus, alias Sister Inviolata of the Immaculate Conception: two 
small-time mobsters on the lam after fleecing the mob. Their accidental 
transvestism deliberately slights any perverse double appeal. They lack the 
sexiness and panache of Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in "Some Like It Hot," the 
stoic dignity of Cary Grant in "I Was a Male War Bride" or the flirty 
aggressiveness of Dustin Hoffman in "Tootsie." 
</P>
<P>
But Idle and Coltrane are masters of caricature. Idle turns himself into a 
pop-eyed hysterical spinster; Coltrane goes sly and tartily fat. They generate 
a certain amount of raw laughter just waddling or tip-toeing across the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Casting them together is a sort of coup. But it's the only one writer-director 
Jonathan Lynn has. "Nuns on the Run" is like its title: half-funny, mechanical, 
a little crude. Lynn is a master of neither slapstick nor badinage. He uses 
only the most raw, blatant ideas: putting his spurious nuns in the girls' 
shower room; making "Euphemia" the target of randy Father Seamus (Tom Hickey), 
a watery-eyed priest with wandering hands; having them clamber through windows 
and tumble into a nun's bed -- a drunken nun, at that. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is like a kid who's gotten license to be naughty in public. It comes 
on, smirks, does its number and then tries to get off fast. The plot is pure 
borrowed "Some Like It Hot": two buddies forced into a drag act to hide out 
from rampaging killers. But these buddies aren't innocents. They're gangsters 
themselves, trying to pull a double-cross. And the nuns aren't innocents 
either; they act like gangsters too. 
</P>
<P>
As the butch rococo Sister Superior, Janet Suzman, the film's best actress, 
spits off her sentences with grande-dame grandeur. The other nuns are equally 
hard-case: drunks and gamblers or crotchety old scolds. The convent has no 
spirit. These aren't the dotty, dithery, funny-ethereal nuns you might expect 
from a good British comedy: Ronald Searle-type nuns with elongated, seraphic 
expressions, P.G. Wodehouse comic cranks or political schemers out of Tom 
Sharpe. They aren't even the comic-nasty thug-nuns Monty Python might have 
given us. 
</P>
<P>
They're just a sitcom obstacle course for the two buddies-on-the-run: locking 
up their money, losing the key, forcing them to teach religious class. The 
Catholic-school students look like Penthouse Pets wheeled in and out for a 
shower-room pictorial. And poor Camille Coduri as "Faith," the film's cocktail 
waitress heroine, is given a case of allegedly comic myopia that has her 
bumping into lampposts, dropping drinks and failing to recognize her lover at 
crucial plot points. Faith is Hope's girlfriend. Was Charlie, in a previous 
draft, called Charity? Or Sister Charity? 
</P>
<P>
The conception lacks tension and Lynn's satire on Catholicism lacks bite. Even 
the funniest idea, Sister Charlie's sudden obsession with the dogma he learned 
as a boy, works mostly because of Coltrane's bumptious, boisterous delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn is a TV comedy writer -- his "Yes, Prime Minister" is said, in the press 
book, to be "Margaret Thatcher's favorite TV show" -- and his writing has a TV 
sketch ephemerality. When he starts juggling plot complications, they're so 
smooth, slick and derivative, it's sometimes hard to notice that there are no 
balls in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's the real miracle. "Nuns on the Run" (rated PG-13 despite bawdy 
humor, nudity and irreverence) bounces along with a certain breezy 
extroversion, but its comic notions are as thin as Communion wafers. Even with 
all the hope and charity in the world, you have to take its humor mostly on 
faith.

JAPANESE-DERIVED 'BLIND FURY' A WOULD-BE ACTION COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Blind Fury" (citywide) is a numskull, cornball action comedy about an American 
soldier in Vietnam who, blinded in battle, is nursed back to health by 
villagers and schooled in the art of swordsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
The blind-swordsman gimmick derives from the Japanese "Zatoichi" series, but 
Japanese action scenarios have often provided rousing starting points for 
Westernized reworkings -- witness "The Seven Samurai." The double whammy, of 
course, is that many of the Japanese actioners are, in turn, based on Western 
models. 
</P>
<P>
"Blind Fury" (rated R for violence and strong language) should be a lot more 
fun than it is; the cultural cross-fertilization ought to result in something 
zippier and weirder than this slovenly bash-a-thon, particularly since its star 
is the Dutch Rutger Hauer and its director is the Australian Philip Noyce. 
</P>
<P>
The script by the all-too-American Charles Robert Carner doesn't provide the 
kind of exalted cartoon situations that might have made all this nonsense 
enjoyable -- like, for example the Arnold Schwarzenegger/John Irvin "Raw Deal" 
of a few years back. "Blind Fury" is a rehashing of movies you passed on the 
first time, like, uh, "Over the Top." 
</P>
<P>
Hauer's Nick Parker, back in America after 20 years in the jungles, looks up 
the family of an old war buddy (Terrance O'Quinn) in Miami and becomes 
entangled in a gangland drug war. The film's centerpiece is Nick's bus ride 
from Miami to Reno with his friend's snot-nosed kid (Brandon Call) in tow. 
Naturally, a heavy-duty, pseudo-father-son bond ensues. When the real father 
turns up, we're treated to a Chaplinesque fade-out. The Blind Swordsman as 
Little Tramp is not exactly a brainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
The cruddiness of "Blind Fury" -- which has been on the shelf for a while -- is 
particularly depressing because it represents the sort of project that is being 
offered these days to people of real talent. Not just Hauer, who has been 
straining to carve out an American career, or Noyce, whose first Hollywood film 
this is, but an actor such as O'Quinn, who gave an absolutely smashing, major 
performance in "The Stepfather" back when he was billed as Terry O'Quinn. Even 
if these people entered into "Blind Fury" willingly, with at least the hope of 
scoring a hit and creating some clout, the results must be scary and not a 
little dispiriting -- like blindly swinging a sword at a roomful of enemies. 
</P>

FRENCH ORCHESTRA AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't try to tell anyone in the Orchestre National de France, or Lorin Maazel 
for that matter, that Beethoven is a greater composer than Saint-Saens. They 
might get angry. At least so it would seem if their Wednesday night concert at 
Ambassador Auditorium is any indication. 
</P>
<P>
Maazel began with Beethoven's "Fidelio" Overture, in a polite, tidy rendition, 
notable more for nimbleness than weighty heroics. He followed with more 
Beethoven, the Symphony No. 4. It started promisingly enough, the opening 
Adagio taking on a sinister quality with the measured calm of Maazel's pacing 
and poised balances in the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
But thereafter it was as if Maazel and orchestra had switched to automatic 
pilot. He made graceful, sometimes cute, always dapper gestures; the orchestra 
responded with nonchalant neatness. The outer movements lacked robustness, 
moving along at times with a certain elegance, but with little feeling for 
their playfulness. The Adagio became a leisurely stroll, a pleasant rehashing 
of the notes. 
</P>
<P>
This orchestra plays well; its strings are a unified body in tone and 
execution, and the woodwinds have a distinctive, grainy blend. And there were 
good moments: some telling rhythmic points in the Minuet, an alertly shaped 
trio and beautiful clarinet solos in the Adagio. But these remained just 
moments in a musical whole of cool indifference. 
</P>
<P>
It was a different matter altogether with Saint-Saens' "Organ" Symphony. Here, 
the orchestra dug in with aggressiveness and fire, the strings in particular 
taking on a powerful, brilliant sheen. There were sweeping lyrical lines and 
big, rich-toned climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble played the Adagio with clear passion, and, in the lurid Finale, 
made a brassy, muscular noise, with the help of the guest soloist, Douglas 
Major, on the Allen Digital Computer Organ. Instant bravos at the end and a 
standing ovation -- but it was still only Saint-Saens. TIMOTHY MANGAN

COMING OF AGE DURING THE FALKLAND ISLANDS CONFLICT

Miguel Periera's "Veronico Cruz" (at the Monica 4-Plex's Premiere Showcase) is 
an Argentine film of stunning simplicity that suggests how the lives of those 
living in primitive conditions in remote areas can be affected drastically by 
distant political events. 
</P>
<P>
On one level, it is the touching, familiar story of a young, dedicated 
schoolteacher (Juan Jose Camero) who perseveres in a rugged locale and inspires 
a bright peasant boy (Gonzalo Morales) with a thirst for knowledge and a desire 
to find his way in the larger world. Yet Periera, drawing from the experiences 
of an actual rural teacher, Fortunato Ramos, stands the old "Corn Is Green" 
plot on its head with the utmost subtlety and irony. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the film is anti-intellectual but rather that Periera reminds us 
that there are no guarantees that go with education -- that civility is no 
protection in a world not as civilized as it ought to be. "Veronico Cruz," in 
fact, leaves us with the feeling that the eternal promise of renewal, as 
embodied in childbirth, is our only sure hope and consolation. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the teacher gains the confidence of a tiny community, inhabited by 
descendants of the ancient Incans, in a high mountain desert of the Andes in 
the far northwestern corner of Argentina. Little Veronico Cruz's grandmother 
(Ana Maria Gonzales) is at first resistant to letting him be educated, citing 
that education for his father merely meant training him to work in faraway cane 
fields. The teacher explains that his shining purpose is to educate the 
community's children not merely to work for others but to think for themselves, 
to prepare them for "greater opportunities." As it happens, however, the 
education of Veronico Cruz commences in the era of Argentina's military 
dictatorship and culminates with the Falklands War. 
</P>
<P>
"Veronico Cruz" (Times-rated Mature) opens with a long sequence of 
near-wordless pure cinema in which we witness Veronico's mother die in 
childbirth and his father giving him up to his grandmother to raise. It retains 
its strong visual quality even as some spare, occasionally humorous dialogue 
develops. The stark, sweeping grandeur of the austere locales (photographed by 
Gerry Feeny ) is underlined by Jaime Torres' evocative score, performed on 
original Andean instruments, and augmented by David Eppel's electronic music. 
The film's rich sights and sounds are balanced by splendidly understated acting 
-- Camero being the only professional in the cast. A particular pleasure is Don 
Leopoldo Aban as the amusing, philosophical village elder.

Mysteriously Becalmed: Two out of three recent works by California-born Gerald 
Kamitaki -- who seems to be showing mostly in Japan these days -- are becalmed 
in the waters of Zen-like mystery. "Untitled Enclosure" consists of long 
canvas-covered lengths of wood forming a huge, concentric, roughly diamond 
shape on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
They are all painted black, with a few stray blank areas, and are studded with 
nails that poke out of oversized holes in the canvas. Varying degrees of care 
are given to the cleanness of the transition between abutting lengths of wood. 
What this is all meant to signify is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
"Skyscraper" consists of a grid of 25 double-paned white lacquer frames holding 
faintly shiny pieces of blue cloth. Each "pane" is pierced by Kamitaki's pet 
motif of nails protruding from oversized holes. But here this gesture suggests 
a kind of frightfully dogged yet random violence, a will toward completeness 
that is as cleanly planned and blandly executed as the perfect architecture of 
the frames themselves. (Hoffman Gallery, 912 Colorado Ave., to March 31.) CATHY

Old Master Landscapes: On small, thick pieces of unframed wood, Joan Nelson 
paints glorious landscape fragments that look as though they were snipped out 
of the backgrounds of Old Master paintings. Dark bumps of trees cluster below a 
perfect azure sky, ferny treetops are silhouetted at dusk, a soft yellow light 
penetrates a deep brown thicket. 
</P>
<P>
Graced with the delicacy, luminosity and gently abraded surfaces of their 
sources, these tiny images in oil are simultaneously old and new. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson quotes the differing visions and terrains of Renaissance and Baroque 
painters from the lowlands, France and Italy so pristinely that they conjure up 
a great swell of nostalgia for eras when landscape signified no less than an 
earthly revelation of divine presence. Yet, without depending on strategies of 
"appropriation," the young California artist's approach is squarely up-to-date. 
By condensing the painterly vision of nature into such small and distinctive 
formats, Nelson replenishes the genre with the sense of delight that repeated 
viewings and museum-sore feet may have worn thin. (Michael Kohn Gallery, 920 
Colorado Ave., to April 8.) CATHY CURTIS

Beefy Constructions: Known for the delicacy of her paper and stick forms, the 
newest constructions of Ann Page come as something of a shock. Beefier, less 
kite-like, almost tuberous, at times they recall the pod shapes of Magdalena 
Abakanowicz. 
</P>
<P>
Fleshiness makes for intriguing, disturbing objects rife with bodily 
associations that seem to be mutating to some other kind of life form. 
</P>
<P>
Like embryos, these forms develop physically, making the artist's chain of 
thought tangible and leading toward increasingly solid organic masses. Folding, 
unfolding, cutting, numbering, and tying off creates solids that suggest 
molecular models as well as fetal forms. 
</P>
<P>
Page disconcertingly nails down those associations in pieces like "Dog-leg 
Left" and "Medley (Alliteration V)," two wall-mounted sculptures festooned with 
bulbous wads of bound cloth. Part pupa, part side of beef they may be the end 
of the evolutionary chain hinted at in the many layered installation ". . . the 
'success' of previous flights." But the way these new pieces flip back and 
forth between life and death, evolution and abortion, they offer no easy -- or 
even comfortable -- answers. (Space, 6015 Santa Monica Blvd., to March 31.)

A Bow to Tradition: James Griffith's paintings, which blend historic European 
landscape painting with botanical and formalist studies, are wonderfully dense 
and inviting. Each canvas contains a dark fragment of brownish atmosphere 
overlaid with a snip of chiaroscuro vegetation that's been done with remarkable 
painterly quickness and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Panels of thick white paint surround and cut into this area of spatial 
illusion, simultaneously defining and isolating that conceit. A final layer of 
intellectualization is applied by a large, needle-fine incised plant form that 
cuts over both painting and white ground. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly invisible linear plant shape, which suggests a stylized baroque 
stencil, deftly but gently unifies the flat white space with more traditionally 
painted areas of the canvas. It also adds a surprising amount of movement to 
the static geometry of the two opposing areas. Richly resonant with the 
traditions of painting from Rembrandt to Robert Ryman, each canvas seems to 
argue for a simultaneous exploration of realist and abstract formal concerns. 
Together the separate panels gain strength and fresh meaning from their 
improbable juxtaposition. (Saxon-Lee Gallery, 7525 Beverly Blvd., to March 31.)

FLEUR DE VIN: A LITTLE PROVENCE IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fleur de Vin has a shrewdly chosen wine list and about a dozen wines available 
by the glass. It has a big bar and comforting old paintings on the walls. This 
is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
What's really going on here at the wind-swept corner of Raymond and Green 
streets in Pasadena is not some wine-drinker's hangout but a Provencal 
restaurant. Or rather, a restaurant of Provencal and associated cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
The cooking of Southern France is oddly under-represented in our part of the 
world, in view of the fact that it was part of the original inspiration for 
nouvelle cuisine. Like Italian food, it's based on fresh vegetables and hearty 
earthy stuff like garlic and olives and mushrooms, rather than the rich 
ingredients of haute cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there, actual Italian dishes have invaded Provence. Bagna caoda is 
one: a huge basket of raw vegetables, including whole fennel root with feathery 
leaves, to be dipped in a a pot of thin anchovy-flavored sauce. (Fleur de Vin 
also adds a pot of the typical Provencal garlicky mayonnaise aioli.) A salad 
made of mesclun, defined on the menu as "a whimsical mixture of several 
lettuces," is basically Provencal. Those would be baby lettuces, of course, in 
a slightly mustardy dressing, earthily scattered with pine nuts and thick-cut 
bacon. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the one dish identified as Provencal, veal flank with 
Provencal vegetables, comes with the same vegetables as everything else: 
zucchini in tomato sauce; cold, cooked sweet peppers and a little square of 
gratinee potatoes. Here it looks as if we've finally wandered into nouvelle 
cuisine territory, the veal having been sliced and arranged in a fan shape, 
except that it isn't sliced paper-thin and the sauce is a good old-fashioned 
one of reduced red wine and shallots. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a lot of quite successful dishes could pass equally well as nouvelle 
or exoticized Provencal. Which would you call the chicken breast on its bed of 
chanterelle mushrooms and leek greens? The breast of pheasant with its 
mushrooms and tiny little bit of tart black currant sauce? The seafood 
fricassee, with its clams, mussels and shrimp in a strong saffron cream sauce? 
</P>
<P>
Something called ahi gazpacho, though, does seem to come from the nouvelle 
side, and not the most beloved strain either. It's scarcely a soup at all, 
rather a thick cold sauce of pureed sweet peppers and green onions with a 
little square slice of raw tuna in the middle; a diverting appetizer, but you 
wouldn't sit still for a large helping. 
</P>
<P>
And the filet Roquefort, a tender bud of steak topped with melted Roquefort 
cheese accompanied by a moderately sweet port wine sauce, is unexpectedly 
Continental. Misconceived, to boot, since you'd have to scrape away most of the 
cheese to taste the steak. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are uniformly satisfying, except maybe the severely simple poached 
pear served in a little bit of wine-flavored syrup. Others include a nice sharp 
lemon tart, a quite good creme brulee and a rich and eggy chocolate mousse. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, there is spectacular caramel ice cream. People who idly take their 
first mouthful without paying attention are likely to stop in mid-chew, 
transfixed by its impossible creaminess and wonderful fresh caramel flavor. 
</P>
<P>
We need more Provencal food around here. Here's a suggestion to help popularize 
it: It's all but impossible to finish all the raw vegetables of the bagna 
caoda, so the customer should be allowed to take home the leftovers. Not in a 
doggy bag, of course, but a bunny bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleur de Vin, 70 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena. (818) 795-0085. Open for lunch 
Tuesday through Friday, dinner Tuesday through Sunday. Full bar. One-hour 
validated parking nearby. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food 
only, $50-$67.

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: TELLTALE SIGNS WARN OF PIRATED RENTAL TAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How do you know when you've rented a pirated tape? 
</P>
<P>
If you're like most people, you don't, according to Mark Harrad, communications 
director for the Motion Pictures Assn. of America. The discovery isn't made 
until they put the tape on their VCR at home and are hit with the poor quality 
of the sound or the picture -- fuzzy and blurred color. 
</P>
<P>
But there are tell-tale signs to look for before you get the tape home, Harrad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
First, the label of a pirated tape looks handmade or Xeroxed. "If the ink 
smudges or there's a black-and-white, typed label on a tape released by a major 
company, it's possible the tape was illegally made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Second, if the cassette has a brand name -- like Scotch or Maxell -- 
prominently displayed, it may be a pirate. Harrad said that you rarely find the 
tape brand name boldly showing on legitimate cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Once you get the tape home, there's another sign of an illegally made cassette 
-- an excess of unused tape at the end. "If the movie is only 103 minutes and 
there's 120 minutes worth of tape, you might have a pirated tape," he said. 
"The video companies don't waste tape. When they have their movies duplicated, 
they're not going to leave 18 minutes of unused tape. That's throwing money 
away. But a pirate would leave that extra tape." 
</P>
<P>
It's possible, Harrad added, that some of these signs don't mean the tape is 
pirated. The retailer could have replaced a label that had been ruined somehow 
or the tape could simply be defective. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are that a large percentage of renters have rented a pirated tape. 
Harrad said that 10% of all video stores deal in pirated tapes at some time. 
Retailers either make the tapes themselves or buy them from pirates who sell 
them at bargain rates. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the MPAA assisted law enforcement agencies in 227 raids, 
confiscating more than 86,000 pirated tapes. Most of these raids were for 
violations of the federal copyright law. But Harrad added that more and more 
charges are being filed against pirates based on state and local laws. 
</P>
<P>
Harrad said this record number of raids doesn't mean there's been an increase 
in piracy. It's a result, he pointed out, of a larger investigative force and 
more cooperation from state and local officials, plus more help from consumers 
and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
If you suspect a retailer of piracy, you can report it to the MPAA anti-piracy 
hotline ((800) NO-COPYS or (800) 662-6797). MPAA investigators do not 
immediately swoop down, Harrad said. They will watch suspect stores over a 
period of time to make sure the complaint is justified.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: TRIO OF RELEASES SHOW PRESLEY'S INFLUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elvis Presley's influence and his influences are both saluted in a series of 
new compact disc releases. 
</P>
<P>
Item 1: "The Million Dollar Quartet" (RCA Records, 67 minutes) -- Though 
available since 1988 as an import CD from England's Charly Records label, this 
package marks the first time the 1956 summit meeting of Elvis and fellow Sun 
Records artists Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins has been released 
domestically. The album, which captures one of the most celebrated moments in 
rock history, is a collector's treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Presley, who began his recording career in 1954 at Sun, had already moved on to 
RCA Records and become a national sensation when he dropped in at Memphis' Sun 
studio in December of 1956 during a Perkins recording session. Cash and Lewis 
were also on hand. 
</P>
<P>
During a break in the recording, the four sang gospel, country and rock tunes 
-- from "Peace in the Valley" and "Crazy Arms" to Chuck Berry's "Brown Eyed 
Handsome Man" to "Don't Be Cruel" -- for more than an hour. Early in the 
good-natured jam, Sun's Sam Phillips turned on the tape machine and captured 
the session. 
</P>
<P>
Because Cash's voice is hard to discern on most of the album, it has been 
widely assumed that he left the session after a few minutes. But Cash said 
recently that he was present during the entire jam. The reason he's hard to 
hear, he said, is that Presley and Lewis, who took turns at the piano, played 
the songs in a higher key than Cash prefers, so he simply sang some background 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of "The Million Dollar Quartet" is when Presley tells the 
others about seeing Jackie Wilson, then a member of Billy Ward &amp; the 
Dominoes, doing a version of "Don't Be Cruel" in Las Vegas, apparently as part 
of a Presley medley. 
</P>
<P>
"He had already done 'Hound Dog' and another (song or two of mine) . . . and he 
didn't do too well, you know. He was trying too hard. . . . But man, he sung 
('Don't Be Cruel'). . . . I went back four nights straight and heard that guy." 
</P>
<P>
Item 2: "Mystery Train" (RCA Records, 40 minutes) -- Part of the appeal of this 
score to Jim Jarmusch's moody but wickedly funny film is that it features both 
Presley's 1955 version of the title track and bluesman Junior Parker's original 
1953 version. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the album offers Presley's mid-'50s version of Rodgers and Hart's 
"Blue Moon" as well as such other Memphis gems as Otis Redding's "Pain in My 
Heart," Bobby (Blue) Bland's "Get Your Money Where You Spend Your Time" and Roy 
Orbison's "Domino." 
</P>
<P>
(Fans of Screamin' Jay Hawkins, the colorful early rock showman who plays the 
enigmatic hotel manager in "Mystery Train," will be interested in "Voodoo 
Jive," a best-of Hawkins package just released by Rhino Records. It includes 
Hawkins' landmark "I Put a Spell on You.") 
</P>
<P>
Item 3: "Mystery Train/Junior Parker, James Cotton, Pat Hare" (Rounder Records, 
38 minutes) -- Elvis is shown on the cover of this album, along with Parker and 
Bobby (Blue) Bland, though he isn't featured on the album itself. But it does 
include nine songs (five of them previously unreleased in North America) by 
Parker, one of Presley's many blues influences. The Parker tunes include 
"Mystery Train" and "Love My Baby," described in rock historian Colin Escott's 
liner notes as one of the first examples of black rockabilly.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS,' ROGER RABBIT SHORT 
FOR $22.99 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
The surprise blockbuster of last summer comes to video today with a pleasingly 
surprising price. "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," which grossed $130 million at the 
box office, shrinks to only $22.99 on tape. That includes the Roger Rabbit 
cartoon "Tummy Trouble," which also accompanied the film in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Rick Moranis, Matt Frewer, Marcia Strassman, Amy O'Neill and Robert 
Oliveri, the fantastic comedy shows what four kids encounter as they travel 
across a yard after being reduced to bug size. If you don't expect anything too 
profound, this Walt Disney release (rated PG) is a lot of special-effects fun 
for the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
There's also something special in the new-release racks for fans of the late 
Bette Davis. MGM/UA has come up with six more of her films from the '30s and 
'40s for $19.95 each: 
</P>
<P>
* "Dangerous" (1935). The actress won her first Oscar for her part in this 
enjoyable soaper. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Man Who Came to Dinner" (1941). Remarkable both for being a comedy (she 
made few) and for Davis' part being smaller than usual during this period, this 
was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play, also starring Monty Wooley. 
</P>
<P>
* "Deception" (1946). Powerful melodrama about a pianist and the jealous men in 
her life (Claude Rains and Paul Henreid). 
</P>
<P>
* "The Great Lie" (1941). In this one, Mary Astor's the pianist (and Oscar 
winner) battling Davis in a tumultuous romance-and-tragedy soaper. 
</P>
<P>
* "In This Our Life" (1942). John Huston directed Davis as a woman who 
threatens to ruin the life of her sister (Olivia de Havilland). 
</P>
<P>
* "A Stolen Life" (1946). This time Davis plays both sisters in a soap opera 
about twins in love with -- you guessed it -- the same guy. 
</P>
<P>
Also just out: 
</P>
<P>
"Little Monsters" (MGM/UA, $89.95, PG). Comedy for young fans of Fred Savage 
("The Wonder Years") only. 
</P>
<P>
"A Dangerous Life" (J2, $79.95). Even though it stars Gary Busey, this 
made-for-TV film isn't a documentary about his helmet-less motorcycle wreck; 
it's a drama about the change of power in the Philippines. TERRY ATKINSON

An explosion tore through a mosque in Rennes in western France, apparently the 
latest in a series of attacks against Muslim immigrants from North Africa. No 
one was injured in the blast, which came hours before the governing Socialist 
Party was to open a four-day congress in the city. The blast, apparently caused 
by an explosive planted against a wall, heavily damaged the building, police 
said.

Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas shot and killed 19 peasants, nearly 
all of them women and children, in a small Andean hamlet where they had fled to 
escape rebel attacks in their own village, police said. The massacre occurred 
in Pishupiaco, 60 miles southeast of Huancayo, a major trading center in the 
Andes 120 miles east of the capital city of Lima. Reports of the killings were 
delayed by the village's isolation.

Gunmen in police uniform burst into Lebanon's Central Bank in Muslim West 
Beirut and tried to abduct the bank governor, Edmond Naim, 72, but were driven 
off by guards who opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
"They manhandled him, punched him in the face, beat him and insulted him before 
the Central Bank guards opened fire and forced them to flee," according to one 
senior army officer in charge of bank security. Bank and security officials 
said the gunmen included people assigned to protect Lebanon's Interior Minister 
Elias Khazen. Naim has angered Khazen by refusing to supply funds he viewed as 
unnecessary.

Rauf Denktash resigned as president of the breakaway Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus to clear the way for early elections that he said will be a 
referendum on the divided island's future. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential elections will be held April 22 and parliamentary elections May 6. 
Denktash complained that some Turkish Cypriot politicians have accused him of 
being too uncompromising in talks on reunifying Cyprus. The latest round of 
U.N.-sponsored talks collapsed earlier this month over Turkish Cypriot demands 
for self-determination. Cyprus has been split into northern Turkish and 
southern Greek sectors since 1974.

Five defendants, including a Clovis chiropractor, have pleaded guilty in 
federal court in an outgrowth of a Porterville drug case authorities called the 
biggest in San Joaquin Valley history. 
</P>
<P>
The chiropractor, Thomas Joe Henrique, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, as did 
Kenneth Spray and Donald Lujan Castro. Guilty pleas were also entered by Scott 
Murphy to conspiracy charges and by David Harp to charges of possession and 
aiding and abetting distribution of heroin. The federal grand jury in Fresno 
indicted the defendants last April on charges of conspiring to distribute 1,300 
pounds of cocaine. Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl Faller said those indictments grew 
out of the seizure in 1988, of 480 pounds of cocaine in a mini-storage 
warehouse.

OVERRIDE OF VETO ON MENTAL HEALTH FAILS

<P>
An effort to override Gov. George Deukmejian's veto of $15 million in mental 
health aid failed in the Assembly. The 45-24 vote fell well short of the 
two-thirds majority of 54. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt was squelched by the same Republican defense of the governor that 
has safeguarded every Deukmejian veto since he took office in January, 1983. 
Democrats hold a 46-33 majority with one vacancy. The bill would have restored 
$15 million in financing for community mental health programs. Defending the 
veto, Deukmejian said the $1.1-million rainy-day reserve in this year's budget 
already has been cut in half by earthquake-related costs and revenue revisions. 
He also said state mental health spending has increased from $630 million to 
$1.25 billion since 1983, and community mental health aid has doubled to $793 
million.

PROPOSAL TO DOUBLE BRIDGE TOLLS FAILS

The Assembly rejected a proposal to double the toll on seven state-run bridges 
in the San Francisco Bay Area -- from $1 to $2 -- to raise $200 million for 
public transit. The bill was introduced during the Legislature's special 
session to address special needs after the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
It failed on a 26-35 vote, well short of the two-thirds majority needed to 
clear the 80-member house. But Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) said he would 
revise his measure and bring it up again in regular session. Besides doubling 
tolls, it provides free passage for cars carrying three or more people, 
including the driver. The measure does not apply to the locally operated Golden 
Gate Bridge, which already has a $2 toll.

CONSERVATIVES READY 1990 NEA OFFENSIVE; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: RIGHT-WING GROUPS AND POLITICIANS MAKE COMMON CAUSE IN LATEST WAVE OF 
CRITICISM AGAINST THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Conservative groups and politicians have begun a long-awaited 1990 offensive 
against the National Endowment for the Arts, giving evidence of a unified 
assault on the federal government's most visible cultural agency. 
</P>
<P>
Among the elements in the newest wave of criticism: 
</P>
<P>
* The right-wing American Family Assn., based in Tupelo, Miss., has distributed 
thousands of letters and pre-printed postcards since last Friday to be mailed 
to senators and congressmen. The cards and letters denounce the NEA for 
supporting "obscene, pornographic or anti-Christian 'art' exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this week, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) released the third in a 
series of broadsides focusing on specific NEA grants for alleged indecent or 
sacrilegious subject matter. The newest letter by the Los Angeles area 
congressman denounced "Modern Primitives," an art and performance show 
organized by a Seattle artist organization and featured at Southern Exposure, a 
gallery affiliated with San Francisco's Project Artaud, late last year. 
</P>
<P>
* Separately, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, head of the Orange County-based 
Traditional Values Coalition, is scheduled to meet in Washington today with 
Rohrabacher and other conservatives. Sheldon reportedly told supporters earlier 
this week he plans to go to the White House today to insist that President Bush 
direct NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer to purge grant programs of funding to 
any arts project that could be objectionable to fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said Sheldon did not have an appointment with Bush, but aides 
were uncertain if Sheldon was scheduled to meet with other Administration 
officials. Sheldon's son, Steve, who functions as his press spokesman, insisted 
a White House meeting was scheduled, but declined to provide details. 
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, the White House said Louis Sheldon had appeared unannounced at 
a meeting conducted by Bush to discuss legislation for the disabled. A 
spokesman said Sheldon introduced himself to Bush but that art issues were not 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The first wave of mail from the American Family Assn. campaign has begun to hit 
offices of senators on a subcommittee that will consider legislation to renew 
the arts endowment's legislative mandate for five more years. The group was the 
first conservative organization to take on the NEA last year when its director, 
Donald E. Wildmon, initiated a protest over an endowment-supported national 
show that included a photograph of a crucifix immersed in urine. 
</P>
<P>
Senate sources said the pattern of the new campaign is similar to tactics 
employed last year by the American Family Assn. The controversy touched off by 
the 1989 letter-writing campaign ballooned into one of the most serious crisis 
ever faced by the arts endowment. Pre-printed cards supplied by Wildmon's group 
for mailing to congressmen read: "I urge you to vote to cut out all funding of 
the National Endowment for the Arts. The only way to safeguard my tax dollars 
is to remove all government funding of NEA." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's newest target, "Modern Primitives," includes work by Los Angeles 
area visual and performance artists. It focuses on body piercing -- including 
piercing of the genital organs -- as elements in the worldwide practice of body 
decoration. 
</P>
<P>
"It is utter madness that your constituents and mine are forced to pay for such 
things through their taxes," Rohrabacher said in a letter to his House 
colleagues. NEA records indicate that Project Artaud received $5,000 last year 
for general support of exhibits by "emerging and established artists," though 
the "Modern Primitives" show was not given a specific grant. The Center on 
Contemporary Art in Seattle, the show's organizer, got $17,500 under the same 
program of general support. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, arts supporters may be better prepared for this 
year's conservative campaign against the NEA than they were in 1989, when even 
major arts organizations waited weeks -- even months -- before they joined in 
political combat over attempts to cut the NEA budget in retaliation for 
allegedly offensive grants. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento on Tuesday, for instance, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los 
Angeles), received a standing ovation at a meeting sponsored by the California 
Confederation of the Arts when she lashed out at "right wing Neanderthals who 
will dare to tell us what is beautiful and what is not beautiful or what is 
right or what is wrong." Waters, who is running for the House seat left vacant 
by the death of Rep. Augustus Hawkins, warned state arts advocates that a 
successful conservative assault on the NEA would lead to other restrictive 
social legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be sure that they (Helms, Rohrabacher and their conservatives 
colleagues) are going to be there messing with us on some other issue" if the 
NEA is effectively destroyed, Waters said. "That which protects us is that 
right to the freedom of expression. Don't be afraid to be strong and to be loud 
and to be determined. What you see now is no mistake (It is conservative) 
leadership that is dangerous; leadership that would try to dictate what is good 
and what is bad." 
</P>
<P>
The threat to the NEA is expected to be the main focus of National Cultural 
Advocacy Day in Washington on Tuesday. A newly formed national group, the Arts 
Coalition for Cultural Freedom, will hold a separate rally on the steps of the 
Capitol later Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent Los Angeles interview, Rohrabacher he was "just starting" this 
year's offensive against the NEA. "I think what I have done in the last year or 
so and so far this year has been a very big success," Rohrabacher said, 
"because we've got the whole country debating whether the federal government 
should be involved in funding of the arts." 
</P>
<P>
In this week's letter to his House colleagues, Rohrabacher ridiculed "Modern 
Primitives" as an exercise in sadomasochism. "Congress is struggling to come up 
with funds for prenatal care for poor women and Head Start programs for our 
children," he said, "yet we are using tax dollars to fund S&amp;M shows. 
Congress must either get the federal government out of the arts or establish 
basic standards." 
</P>
<P>
Jon Winet, director of the Southern Exposure gallery, said "Modern Primitives" 
reflects a process under which "artists, writers and scholars are increasingly 
investigating issues concerning the human body. 
</P>
<P>
"Art of importance can be, and often is, challenging as well as inspiring. The 
important issue raised by the current controversy over arts funding is freedom 
of expression." 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Murphy, executive director of the National Assn. of Artist 
Organizations, a national group, said "arts organizations like Southern 
Exposure provide artists with a place to experiment. Today's risk-takers are 
tomorrow's creative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Arts groups have moved with various degrees of resolve to meet the conservative 
challenge, raising questions about fragmentation and paralysis within the arts 
community. Thursday, Murphy said her organization and a half-dozen other artist 
groups expect to form a new activist coalition, the National Campaign for 
Freedom of Expression, sometime this month to perk up the debate and persuade 
artists they must prepare for political hand-to-hand combat. 
</P>
<P>
"Rohrabacher and Helms want to divorce freedom of speech from federal support 
of the arts. The truth is Americans want both. Over the next few months, the 
arts community and its supporters will make it clear that the far right's 
agenda to kill free speech endangers us all." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's broadside on "Modern Primitives" had been expected for more than 
a week. Staffers first said the letter would be distributed last week, then 
abruptly changed plans. But, like a earlier communication that complained about 
NEA support of an art show in Illinois that included an image of Jesus Christ 
with a syringe protruding from his arm, this week's Rohrabacher letter 
attracted little media attention. 
</P>
<P>
Though release of the communication was not a surprise, the background of how 
Rohrabacher came to make a particular issue of the show appeared to confirm 
that conservative congressmen have joined forces under the overall command of 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). The strategy has designated Rohrabacher as the point 
man taking the most visible public role. 
</P>
<P>
The release also appeared to verify existence of a coordinated campaign against 
artists targeted in a series of letters sent by Helms to the arts endowment 
late last year. The Helms letters, obtained by The Times under the Freedom of 
Information Act in January, included specific inquiries about four arts groups 
and seven individual artists involved in "Modern Primitives." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Waddell, Rohrabacher's press spokesman, said staff members became aware of 
"Modern Primitives" from Helms aides shortly after Helms received responses to 
his correspondence with the NEA last November. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional observers said conservatives apparently intend for Rohrabacher to 
generate as much publicity over allegedly offensive grants as he can, then to 
give way to Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), who will attempt -- probably without 
success, these observers say -- to attach amendments requiring strict controls 
on the content of federally-supported art to the bill renewing the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
When the legislation gets to the Senate, these observers say, Helms is expected 
to resurface as the commander of conservative forces, attempting to cripple the 
arts agency with a series of regressive amendments to the bill. Helms's office 
did not return calls seeking the senator's comments on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Gillespie, Armey's press spokesman, said Armey did not plan to joint 
directly in Rohrabacher's campaign to vilify specific grants, but "quite 
honestly, we get a pretty big kick out of it." Armey, Gillespie said, "has a 
pretty good sense of what he can get on the floor" and what Armey attempts to 
do to the legislation in the House "depends on how successful Rohrabacher is."

<P>
FILM: THE DIRECTOR OF 'COUPE DE VILLE' IS UNCONVINCED HE HAS A TALENT FOR 
DIRECTING, SO HE'S HAPPY HE HAS A DAY JOB -- AS CHAIRMAN OF 20TH CENTURY FOX.

<P>
The Hard Rock Cafe was jumping. To celebrate an invitation-only screening of 
Universal's new film, "Coupe de Ville," the chic West Hollywood eatery was 
packed with Hollywood's finest -- actors, producers, agents and lawyers -- all 
eager to meet one person. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Roth. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever the director of "Coupe de Ville" stopped on his zigzag course through 
the restaurant, a crowd gathered. Shelley Long squeezed his hand and paid her 
respects. Universal Pictures chief Tom Pollock offered hearty congratulations. 
Directors Amy Heckerling and Neil Israel, both old Roth pals, gave the 
41-year-old director affectionate hugs. 
</P>
<P>
As he struggled toward the buffet table, Roth bumped into Billy Crystal, who 
offered praise for "Coupe," which opened to mixed reviews last weekend 
(Universal is broadening its run next Friday to about 150 theaters). Without 
missing a beat, Roth impishly retorted: "How much are you lying?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, maybe a little bit," Crystal said slyly, quickly adding: "Joe, you did 
great." 
</P>
<P>
Roth wasn't enjoying this regal treatment because the crowd here smelled a hot 
new director. In fact, when Israel asked if he was eager to direct again, Roth 
furiously wagged his head. "Oh no. No. No. I'm happy where I am. Whenever I 
watch the movie, I keep saying, 'Thank God, I've got a job. I've got a job!' " 
</P>
<P>
And what a job. Since August, Roth been the chairman of 20th Century Fox Films, 
the first time a director has run a major studio in more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
But even Roth's new-found clout couldn't guarantee a successful celebration. 
Just as the bash hit its stride, a phalanx of police burst into the room, 
accompanied by a local fire marshal, who closed down the restaurant, citing 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
As several burly firemen, wearing big yellow slickers, made their way through 
the Hollywood crowd, Roth reluctantly headed outside, accompanied by his wife, 
Donna. "Geez, what a party," he sighed, eyeing a fire truck parked at the curb. 
"I never even got a burger." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Roth's 20th Century Fox office doesn't have the palatial glaze of most 
movie-mogul throne rooms. Sitting on a scuffed white couch, eyeing his most 
distinctive office props -- a plain wooden desk and a mini-basketball hoop -- 
you get the feeling Fox hasn't wasted any money on decorator's fees for its new 
film division chairman's office. Roth's shelves brim with pictures of his 
family and a photo of his directorial idol, Preston Sturges, playing pool. 
</P>
<P>
Roth's attention is focused on the wall near his desk, where a production chart 
follows the flow of Fox film releases. The batting order gives you a pretty 
good idea of Roth's strategy for turning around the slumping studio. 
</P>
<P>
"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane," Andrew Dice Clay's first starring feature, 
and "Die Hard II," the sequel to the 1988 box-office hit, are slated for June. 
In July, the studio has a pair of high-profile sequels, "Young Guns II" (Roth 
produced the original 1988 hit) and "The Exorcist III." Later in the fall, the 
studio will deliver "Pacific Heights," starring Michael Keaton and Melanie 
Griffith, followed by Tim Burton's "Edward Scissorhands," with "Predator II" 
due at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
It's a fairly conventional production strategy -- an occasional offbeat film 
mixed in with a hefty dose of brand-name sequels and distinctive movies made by 
strong-minded directors. It reflects Roth's strategy during his two-year stint 
running Morgan Creek Productions, where he sandwiched a daring thriller like 
David Cronenberg's "Dead Ringers" between lowbrow crowd-pleasers like "Young 
Guns" and "Major League." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the question is inevitable. How much room does this formula leave for a 
personal film that didn't have a top-name actor -- a picture like "Coupe de 
Ville," which Roth directed for Universal before taking the job at Fox? How 
much room would there be for Roth, whose previous directorial efforts were a 
critically praised flop, "Streets of Gold," and the critically dismissed 
"Revenge of the Nerds"? 
</P>
<P>
"If the person who'd directed 'Streets' and 'Revenge' had come in here and said 
I want to direct a $10-million film with no real stars, I'd probably say no," 
acknowledged Roth, an informal, candid man who dresses simply and has retained 
his lean, high school athlete build. "On the other hand, would I have liked the 
material? Would I have liked the cast? Yes. But is it an obvious sell? No." 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect Roth to look for advice from Hollywood's entrenched market 
research consultants, whom he has derisively dismissed as "voodoo makers." 
</P>
<P>
"This business has become so driven by money and fear that it's become overly 
reliant on testing and research," he said, his voice taking on a steely edge. 
"It's an excuse. A crutch. Worst of all, it pits you against your instincts. 
We've become so statistically driven that we can be ecstatic when we watch a 
movie -- and get depressed when we get bad numbers a half-hour later. That's 
crazy! The sheer, overwhelming data for 'War of the Roses' suggested it was not 
going to be a hit. But it'll end up doing $85 million in the U.S. alone." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Mazursky, who says he "lights candles for Joe every night" for making his 
critically lauded, post-Holocaust romance, "Enemies, a Love Story," confirmed 
this account. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe loved 'Enemies' when he first saw it, but when the research people 
screened it, it didn't get great numbers from a big chunk of the audience. And 
Joe said to me, 'I love the movie more now than I did the first time I saw it. 
Don't worry about the numbers -- I regard them as useless. They're for 
advertising purposes alone. I wouldn't touch your movie.' "

The busy studio chief has green-lighted 16 films during his first seven months 
at Fox. He projects that he'll make 22 movies this year and says he has a 
mandate from Fox Inc. Chairman and CEO Barry Diller to make as many as 30 films 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But what has really made Roth an object of intense industry curiosity is his 
maverick status. The moguls who run Hollywood's other studios have all been in 
place -- or key players in the system -- for more than a decade. Even David 
Puttnam, when he took over Columbia, was a highly visible, Oscar-winning 
producer. But as recently as 1987, before his Morgan Creek films began to 
attract attention, Roth was a virtual unknown operating out of a small 
trailer-office on the Fox lot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the first real outsider to run a studio in years," said Larry Gordon, a 
leading producer who was one of Roth's predecessors running Fox. "He's not a 
member of the club. Everyone else in town -- Eisner, Diller, Katzenberg, 
Sheinberg, Daley, Semel, Pollock, Mancuso, Medavoy, Guber and Peters -- have 
all been around for 20 years. But Joe's from a different crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go in to see those other guys, I'm going into combat, with my flak 
jacket on. There's so much history there. But Joe doesn't carry all that 
baggage around with him." 
</P>
<P>
Still, industry skeptics remain surprised by Roth's swift ascent to executive 
stardom. Before his brief stint at Morgan Creek, he had produced a batch of 
largely undistinguished films, including teen hits ("Bachelor Party"), critic's 
favorites ("The Stone Boy") and such forgettable flicks as "Americathon," "The 
Final Terror" and "P.K. and the Kid." 
</P>
<P>
"Give Joe two years," said one veteran producer. "Then we'll know whether the 
hits he had at Morgan Creek were the result of being truly shrewd or just 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Roth is trying to revive Fox's reputation with exhibitors by 
delivering a host of star-driven films (like Bette Midler's "For the Boys") and 
sequels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very competitive to get theaters," he said. "So they need to know that we 
can bring them event films -- both for summer and for Christmas -- that will 
generate audience interest. But I don't want to make what we call 
'programmers.' You're not going to get people out of the house unless you make 
stories that have a strong emotional hook. The kind of hook that if you had a 
seismograph, it would cause a real blip." 
</P>
<P>
But can Roth run a film studio without eventually getting removed from reality? 
How long will it take before the cagey outsider becomes the complacent insider? 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about that every day," he said. "I try to drive into this lot every 
morning thinking as a producer, trusting my instincts. But it's hard. I wish I 
could enjoy it more when people come over and tell me how much they liked my 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
"But you never know who's sincere and who's not. So one of the ways I guard 
against that is pretty simple -- I figure no one is telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
When Hollywood executives describe Roth, they use the same phrase -- 
competitive. Several years ago, when preparing to produce a baseball film, he 
played center field at a Chicago Cubs fantasy baseball camp. It's somehow 
fitting that Roth's most vivid memory isn't the joy of schmoozing with his 
heroes but the thrill of matching his athletic skills against them. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit against Ferguson Jenkins," he says. "Well, I tried to hit against him. 
The first pitch was a fastball." Roth signals the whoosh of a ball hurtling 
past him. "No chance." 
</P>
<P>
With his checkered past as a director, many thought Roth might be equally 
overmatched when he went off last summer to make "Coupe de Ville," which stars 
Patrick Dempsey, Daniel Stern and Arye Gross as three estranged brothers 
traveling to Florida to meet their father. 
</P>
<P>
A week into shooting, Roth collapsed. "I was so eager to direct that I had us 
shoot in the South in the heat of summer," he said. "I went out there with no 
hat, no sunglasses, no protection. I just snapped. They thought I had a stroke. 
I curled up in a ball and said, 'Let's just pack up and go home. I'm finished.' 
Finally, they put me on an I.V. and my body started sucking up salt. I took the 
next day to recover and then finished the film." 
</P>
<P>
It's revealing that Roth picked Dempsey not simply for his comic flair. "What 
really got Patrick the part was the pain on his face," Roth said quietly. "He'd 
been an unhappy kid who left home early, so he lived out that part. That's 
something all the brothers share -- they're alienated from each other." 
</P>
<P>
Roth identifies with this emotional distance. He grew up in New York, where his 
parents were active unionists. Again Roth was an outsider. "My family was a 
left-wing, artsy family. I was very emotionally cut off from them -- I was more 
comfortable with sports. In school, I'd sit in the front row of class, over in 
the corner, out of the teacher's peripheral vision, and I'd make up all-star 
lineups in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
For most of his 15 years in Hollywood, Roth was also off on the fringe, far 
from front-row center. "I had an awful lot of frustration," he admits. "I 
remember being so frustrated about five years ago that I talked to my 
accountant about going into the cable field." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, when he was producing a film on location in Brazil, he snapped. "I was 
in the middle of the 100-degree heat, in a horrible rainstorm, standing in the 
jungle surrounded by bugs and snakes that could kill anyone within 100 feet," 
he said with a frown. "And I thought, 'I'm not even directing. I'm just 
watching the damn movie being made!' " 
</P>
<P>
When Roth returned, he put his house for collateral and made "Streets of Gold." 
"I love the singularity of focus with directing," he says. "Night shooting is 
so wonderful -- it's just you with the actors. You have a peacefulness you 
don't have in this other job I do." 
</P>
<P>
But Roth has no illusions. "When I watch my movie, I really feel someone else 
can do it better. If I thought I had the talent of a Larry Kasdan or Barry 
Levinson, OK. But I don't think I have that gift." 
</P>
<P>
Roth shrugged. "After all, I didn't give it up to go back and teach at the 
local education center. I have a great job. I'm one of the few guys who can say 
'yes' to making a movie." 
</P>
<P>
Still, you get the feeling Roth's still not entirely comfortable in his new 
role. He admits that when Barry Diller first offered him the Fox job, he turned 
it down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd spent my whole life railing against these institutions, making movies 
about characters who were outlaws," he said. "But Barry convinced me I had a 
mandate to run the company my way -- and to trust my instincts." 
</P>
<P>
Roth gazed wistfully out his office window. "You can't predict anything in this 
business, but here I am."

POP ALBUM CHART: BOLTON BOLTING UP THE CHARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Arts and Entertainment reports from The Times, national and 
international news services and the nation's press.

<P>
Michael Bolton may be the one who finally cracks the Abdul-Jackson stranglehold 
on the top two positions on the Billboard pop album chart. In the last few 
weeks, Bolton's album bolted up to the Top Five -- No. 4 this week -- buoyed by 
Grammy recognition and a new hit single, "How Can We Be Lovers," a fast-rising 
No. 28 on the pop singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
If Bolton doesn't break the dance-music divas' lock on the Top Two, then Bonnie 
Raitt might do it with her "Nick of Time" album, which has been racing up the 
chart since it won the best-album Grammy a few weeks ago. Alannah Myles has her 
first No. 1 pop single with "Black Velvet," which unseated Janet Jackson's 
"Escapade," now No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
* English white-soul singer Lisa Stansfield is making a big splash on the pop 
chart with her "Affection" album, which has climbed to No. 32 in just three 
weeks. The album's big attraction is her red-hot single, "All Around the 
World," which is No. 7 on the pop singles chart -- with No. 1 potential.

JAPANESE-DERIVED 'BLIND FURY' A WOULD-BE ACTION COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Blind Fury" (throughout San Diego County) is a numskull, cornball action 
comedy about an American soldier in Vietnam who, blinded in battle, is nursed 
back to health by villagers and schooled in the art of swordsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
The blind-swordsman gimmick derives from the Japanese "Zatoichi" series, but 
Japanese action scenarios have often provided rousing starting points for 
Westernized reworkings -- witness "The Seven Samurai." The double whammy, of 
course, is that many of the Japanese actioners are, in turn, based on Western 
models. 
</P>
<P>
"Blind Fury" (rated R for violence and strong language) should be a lot more 
fun than it is; the cultural cross-fertilization ought to result in something 
zippier and weirder than this slovenly bash-a-thon, particularly since its star 
is the Dutch Rutger Hauer and its director is the Australian Philip Noyce. 
</P>
<P>
The script by the all-too-American Charles Robert Carner doesn't provide the 
kind of exalted cartoon situations that might have made all this nonsense 
enjoyable -- like, for example the Arnold Schwarzenegger/John Irvin "Raw Deal" 
of a few years back. "Blind Fury" is a rehashing of movies you passed on the 
first time, like, uh, "Over the Top." 
</P>
<P>
Hauer's Nick Parker, back in America after 20 years in the jungles, looks up 
the family of an old war buddy (Terrance O'Quinn) in Miami and becomes 
entangled in a gangland drug war. The film's centerpiece is Nick's bus ride 
from Miami to Reno with his friend's snot-nosed kid (Brandon Call) in tow. 
Naturally, a heavy-duty, pseudo-father-son bond ensues. When the real father 
turns up, we're treated to a Chaplinesque fade-out. The Blind Swordsman as 
Little Tramp is not exactly a brainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
The cruddiness of "Blind Fury" -- which has been on the shelf for a while -- is 
particularly depressing because it represents the sort of project that is being 
offered these days to people of real talent. Not just Hauer, who has been 
straining to carve out an American career, or Noyce, whose first Hollywood film 
this is, but an actor such as O'Quinn, who gave an absolutely smashing, major 
performance in "The Stepfather" back when he was billed as Terry O'Quinn. Even 
if these people entered into "Blind Fury" willingly, with at least the hope of 
scoring a hit and creating some clout, the results must be scary and not a 
little dispiriting -- like blindly swinging a sword at a roomful of enemies. 
</P>

REPORTING ON DRUGS IN KGTV'S 'CARTEL CONNECTION' IS FIRST RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reality permeates "The Cartel Connection," the hourlong KGTV (Channel 10) 
special airing tonight at 9. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter-of-fact, in-depth style rarely found in locally produced 
programming, the show examines the production and distribution of cocaine, 
tracing it from its manufacture in the mountains of South America to the 
streets of Southern California. Reporter Mark Matthews and photographer Richard 
Klein traveled to Peru, Bolivia, Columbia and Mexico to chronicle the business 
of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of simply parroting State Department propaganda, or relying on the 
cliches that often make up coverage of drug trafficking, Matthews and Klein 
take it a step further. They ask tough questions and don't settle for 
portraying the United States as the white knight fighting the good fight. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of drug-growing operations in South America often stop at footage of a 
Drug Enforcement Administration bust. However, in Peru and Bolvia, Matthews and 
Klein got off the State Department tourist train to develop their own sources. 
They talked to residents, venturing into the slums of Lima, to present the 
interdependence, in terms of real people, of the economy and cocaine traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The role of the American government in attempting to slow the industry is 
depicted, but Matthews and Klein are not always satisfied with the answers 
provided by official sources. From a herbicide that kills other crops as well 
as coca plants, to American helicopters that at times sit unused because the 
Peruvian government can't afford gasoline, the viewer is left with serious 
questions about the effectiveness of U.S. programs. 
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, where a "drug war" is in full swing, the local team touches all 
the bases endlessly covered by the network news -- the opulent power of the 
drug lords and the fear that affects all public officials -- but once again 
they go a step further. Top-level Colombian officials are asked why it took so 
long for Colombia to officially declare war on the drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
And, again, they talk to everyday Colombians about the damage that U.S. 
policies are having on the country's non-drug-related industries, such as the 
coffee industry and tourism, although it seems hard to blame the United States 
for Colombia's problems attracting tourists. 
</P>
<P>
From Colombia, the trail continues through Mexico, where "90 percent" of the 
expensive air system designed to stop smuggling comes up empty. Instead of just 
depicting deficiencies, the program points out that measures to slow drugs 
coming across the border are having some effect. They use a smuggler, not the 
government, to confirm the facts. 
</P>
<P>
A "mule" who was caught trying to bring cocaine across the border says that 
someone making $8 to $10 an hour is going to find it tough to resist a $50,000 
payday. That's reality. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego and Los Angeles, Matthews and Klein again break away from official 
presentations to present a broader picture. They hit the streets to talk to an 
active dealer, the type of enterprise reporting rarely undertaken by local news 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of "The Cartel Connection" has aired during Channel 10's regular 
newscasts, it carries far more power as a single package, when the viewer can 
follow the trail step by step. The big picture, the relationship of a poor 
Peruvian farm worker to a crack addict in San Diego, becomes far clearer, as 
does the huge scope of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cartel Connection" exposes the complexities of what is truly an 
international problem, created by rampant drug use in the United States, 
without pulling any punches or accepting at face value the usual answers 
provided by the involved governments.

AT THE GALLERIES: WORK OF ARTIST NAGEL PROVIDES DIVIDED FOCUS

Sheer exuberance has little credibility in today's art world, that cynical 
sphere whose watchword could be "Don't be happy, worry." The unabashed glee of 
an artist like David Hockney tickles the general public's fancy, but it 
deprives the more carnivorous art audience of the gristle it loves to gnaw. 
From skepticism to nihilism, the mood of the hottest contemporary art is 
serious, often to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Nagel, whose work is on view through April 20 at the Tasende Gallery in 
La Jolla (820 Prospect St.), occupies a curious niche in this daunting 
scenario. His style is nothing if not playful, enthusiastic, vivacious. In the 
show's catalogue, gallery owner Jose Tasende traces the source of this 
figurative freedom to a new political openness that dawned during the artist's 
formative years in his native Basque country. 
</P>
<P>
But Nagel's vision is not all helium and confetti. A kind of violence or 
violation -- of the body, the spirit or the urban landscape -- intrudes upon 
the celebration just often enough to persuade that Nagel's work is capable of a 
certain conceptual depth and weight. These radical shifts between a critical, 
philosophical stance and a tone of light frivolity end up plaguing the Tasende 
show with an air of restless indecision. 
</P>
<P>
"Kicks," a wall relief depicting an oversized shoe sending a tin can flying, 
epitomizes Nagel's lighter side. A three-dimensional Pop cartoon, the oil on 
polyester and fiberglass sculpture, glorifies a simple scrap of a moment. Nagel 
plays handily with his materials, fracturing the flat, painted planes to create 
an explosive effect, and mixing aggressive, gestural brushwork with collaged 
metal sheets to ally real and represented forms. In this, as in other wall 
reliefs in the show, Nagel displays an athletic command over form and color, 
but provides no psychological ballast to the works' impressive physical 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
One of the smallest, most modest works in the show, "Smoking Box," has the most 
enduring presence of all. This is no circus of flying forms; this is the quiet 
crime that takes place behind the scenes. Two plumes of solid smoke (formed of 
fiberglass) creep upward out of a wooden crate, cushioned with straw. A worn 
fabric belt stretches across their split, a token gesture of restraint. The 
decisive blow comes from an ax, which has forced a clean crack in one of the 
plumes. Its bearer is invisible, absent, an anonymous power squelching a 
nascent energy. Enigmatic and haunting, "Smoking Box" whispers of dangers 
unforeseen. 
</P>
<P>
Nagel's works on paper speak more plainly about clashing values. Here, etched 
images of monumental public sculptures -- Roman emperors, Christian martyrs -- 
are overrun with intense color and agitated line and subtly undermined by 
collaged elements from the modern world, from condom packages to detergent 
labels. Within the carefully constructed chaos that Nagel has created, residue 
of the cheap and artificial rubs up against symbols of the true and eternal. 
Which better reflects our values -- the intruding but practical clutter of 
contemporary urban life or the idealized figures of history and myth? 
</P>
<P>
The spirited cacophonies of color and texture that frame Nagel's questions 
often overwhelm them, so that a pulsing visual energy becomes the means and end 
of many of the works. Whether a vibrant portrait of two horn players blowing 
solid sound out of their silver-leafed instruments or a massive rendition of a 
couple's melodramatic kiss, these tableaux ensnare the senses while the mind 
roams about, starved and neglected. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like "Smoking Box" and "My Husband Fulfills Me" -- a low relief 
punctured by a thick spike -- linger uncomfortably long in the mind, their 
violence having abraded one's sense of sanctity. The jarring contrast between 
Nagel's benign and playful imagery, like candy straight from the artist's hand, 
and these shadowy threats gives the show a debilitating schizophrenia. The 
artist's intentions blur and the work, with few exceptions, fails to bring them 
into focus.

SPECIAL EFFECTS: TWO COMPANIES WORK ON A WIDE RANGE OF PROJECTS, FROM MOVIE 
BLOOD AND GUTS TO THEME PARK THRILLS TO TRADE SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, Foster is a regular contributor to Valley View.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some call them modern-day wizards. They deal in surprise, capable of 
enthralling millions of moviegoers and theme park enthusiasts with ghoulish 
gore or mystical characters. 
</P>
<P>
They are special-effects designers. And, at one time, they were as much of an 
illusion as the fantasies they created. But that was before blockbuster movies 
like "Star Wars" and "Alien" set the stage for scores of other effect-packed 
films. 
</P>
<P>
Before that time, studios frequently used in-house technicians or free-lance 
artists. But, for the last five years, the trend is for designers to band 
together, forming their own special-effects companies. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, two effects companies are making themselves known 
with their ability to produce a wide range of effects designs. (Although other 
companies exist in the area, they work in limited fields like fires or 
explosives.) Technifex specializes in theme parks and corporate displays. KNB 
EFX, a "blood and guts" outfit, has designed expanding heads and expendable 
body parts for "Nightmare on Elm Street 5" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3." 
</P>
<P>
Rock (Rockne) Hall and Monte Lunde, former Walt Disney "imagineers," began the 
Sun Valley-based Technifex in 1984. Five years later, the pair, who now take in 
nearly $2 million a year, whistle while they work around their 
15,000-square-foot production warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"When you work at Disney as a designer, you're assigned a certain show and 
certain effects," said Lunde, adding that his company now scripts, designs and 
builds all its own effects. "There's just no time to experiment to try out your 
own ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Hall adds: "They were just ideas in our head at the time. We'd get together 
after work and have a beer and talk about how we would do it differently and 
how we could expand marketing effects to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
Today, much of the team's business comes from designing effects for theme parks 
such as Disney's MGM Studio Tour and Universal Studios Florida. But their 1988 
patented technology, Techniscan, a device projecting two-dimensional video 
images, is increasingly used to lure a different breed of 
tourist-convention-goer. 
</P>
<P>
The pair recently demonstrated the technique in their warehouse, staffed by 17 
designers, cinematographers, electricians and machinists. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 38, flicked a switch behind a miniaturized set of a study with roll-top 
desk and table. Soon, a 3-inch-tall Sir Isaac Newton appeared, demonstrating 
the laws of gravity as he tossed a few balls around, sat on a chair and glanced 
at three tiny candle flames that flickered on a candelabrum. 
</P>
<P>
The two-dimensional video image of Newton and the candle flames, Lunde 
explained, is simply matted into the set. The eye is tricked into thinking the 
2-D Newton is as solid as the chair he appears to sit on. The process of 
creating the effect, used frequently by AT&amp;T, Chrysler and Lockheed in 
trade shows, begins with filming an actor dressed as Newton walking about in a 
full-scale version of the miniature set. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very popular at trade shows," said Lunde, 30, a former special-effects 
designer for several Epcot Center pavilions in Florida. "We can really zero in 
on a consumer product and have a character interact with it -- make it come to 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who was once in charge of special effects for the revamping of 
Disneyland's Fantasyland, adds: "People mistake it for a hologram, but this is 
fully animated, in full color, and you can make it talk." 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has welcomed the technology, even with a $100,000 minimum price tag 
for a 10-minute show. The bit of theater is a guaranteed audience-grabber, they 
discovered, especially at conventions where 60,000 people often mill about, 
growing bored with such elaborate displays as towering waterfalls and gyrating 
neon lights. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely gathers a crowd," said Nancy Forrester, AT&amp;T trade show 
manager. "There's a definite story line to the show, so it really rivets 
people's attention. We had a 400% increase in sale leads the first time we used 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the company received its first contract to design and build lighting 
effects for Six Flags Power Plant, a Baltimore theme park. Instead of the 
customary paycheck, Technifex was paid off in saber saws, drill presses, mills, 
lathes and other necessary equipment. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of the company's business now comes from theme parks -- mechanical 
effects, animations, front and rear video projections, depth charges and 
intricate fiber-optics displays. But Hall and Lunde believe future business 
will rely more heavily on Techniscan. The pair have talked to McDonalds and 
representatives of Brooke Shields hair-care products about retail displays 
using Techniscan, but no deals have been struck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a unique effect, and we want it to be a special experience for a certain 
crowd of people," Lunde said. "When the timing is right, it could hit the mass 
market." 
</P>
<P>
KNB EFX is known for its ghoulish creations. The 2,700-foot warehouse has the 
air of a haunted mansion, with cadavers, human heads, severed body parts and 
lots of blood. 
</P>
<P>
Stomach muscles and other body parts have become the company's specialty. The 
Chatsworth enterprise received its first break in mainstream motion pictures 
with its design execution of 16 skinned cadavers for "Gross Anatomy," a 1989 
release from Disney's Touchstone Pictures about first-year medical students. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger (the initials of their last 
names form the acronym KNB) said they perused medical center morgues for a 
month in search of realistic details for the cadavers, featured in a lab scene 
during the film. 
</P>
<P>
"They needed custom-made bodies," explained Berger, 25, who lives in Northridge 
near Kurtzman and Nicotero. "They were calling around town, looking for bodies 
that were previously used (in other films) that they could lay on the lab 
tables, but nothing else was available." 
</P>
<P>
The trio, who have completed 20 films since joining forces, went to work 
sculpting organs out of latex and urethane, which would later be positioned in 
full-body fiberglass molds for the cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a job," said Donna Cline, medical-technical adviser for the 
movie. "I made sure the bodies were accurate in every detail. They were very 
cooperative, very willing. Not everyone has the skill to make those bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Much like Hall and Lunde of Technifex, the three designers banded together 
after working for other companies. "Before, we were like individual 
subcontractors working for different studios and makeup designers," said 
Berger. "We wanted to do our own stuff and get the credit for the work we do. 
We now get the paychecks we feel we deserve." 
</P>
<P>
But the team lost money on effects designed for "Gross Anatomy" and invested 
considerable money on its own. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized it was a big show for us, and that it would give us a chance to 
get out of low-budget, flasher-type films we were working on previously," said 
Nicotero, 26. "It lent a certain amount of credibility to have worked on a 
Disney production, so we gave them a lot more than they asked for." 
</P>
<P>
They feel the job with "Gross Anatomy" has led to bigger projects, such as 
"Dances With Wolves," a Kevin Costner film that recently completed filming. 
</P>
<P>
KNB designed and built 24 buffalo for the film, 21 of which were skinned before 
cameras. "Originally, they were going to kill real buffalo, but a lot of the 
production people thought it wasn't appropriate," Nicotero said. "So we 
sculpted them from scratch ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Kurtzman, 25, adds: "We're still a young company, but we're working our way up 
the ladder." 
</P>
<P>
Scattered around KNB's warehouse are eight work tables on which up to 24 staff 
members labor over latex, pondering how best to sever, crush or rip open models 
of human heads for future films. In one corner, a walk-in oven burns steadily, 
curing molded foam-rubber body parts. Tall shelving houses other fiberglass 
body molds. And, in the company's display room, two skinned corpses are pinned 
to one wall next to gargoyles, Freddy Krueger masks and other nightmarish 
images.

FILMS: THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET DEMANDS MORE THAN BORING FOOTAGE ON 'HOW TO WORK A 
WIDGET.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHMALTZ, Schmaltz is a free-lance writer who lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Say "corporate/industrial film," and images of an expressionless man in a suit 
starring in, "How to Work a Widget" may come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
But, after making a heart-rending film about terminally ill children and 
filming a go-cart running wild on the freeway, Jeff Goldschen knows better. 
</P>
<P>
Goldschen, 31, is president of Creative Reel Productions in Woodland Hills, a 
film and video outfit that specializes in corporate training and educational 
films. Goldschen founded the company 12 years ago while attending Cal State 
Northridge at an age when most film students are dreaming about being future 
Spielbergs. Since then, he has completed more than 160 productions. 
</P>
<P>
Call him the 
</P>
<P>
Wunderkind of the industrial-film biz. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew from the beginning what I wanted to do," said Goldschen from his 
Ventura Boulevard office. "I realized early there was a market out there, and 
that I had the ability to perform a service that had more benefit than pure 
entertainment for the masses. 
</P>
<P>
He views his work as beneficial, he said, because he sees the films as tools to 
train or educate viewers, whether they are employees of a company or 
individuals who just happen to see them. 
</P>
<P>
According to Goldschen, corporate film making is a $9-billion industry that 
utilizes state-of-the-art techniques with budgets running about $1,000 to 
$2,000 per finished minute. Annually producing and directing about $500,000 
worth of short movies and videos for such clients as Security Pacific, 
Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles and Shell Oil, Goldschen and his staff of six 
assistants average about 15 productions a year. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies rely on in-house film production departments and, Goldschen 
said, Creative Reel has turned down offers to join some companies in that 
capacity. It's important for Goldschen to stay independent, to ensure he can 
continue doing what he wants with film. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the go-carts come in. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up in San Francisco with my family a couple of years ago and saw this 
machine at an arcade," Goldschen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The machine, called an SR-2, is a stationary amusement ride that holds as many 
as 12 people. It's a combination theater and roller-coaster, equipped with a 
video screen and hydraulic pedestals that move and shake the interior, giving 
riders the sensation of being in the driver's seat of a vehicle performing 
dangerous, electrifying stunts that they see on the screen. The SR-2, which is 
popular in Asia, is similar to Disneyland's Star Tours attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Goldschen contacted the SR-2 manufacturer, Doron Precision Systems in 
Binghamton, N.Y., and offered his services. After first turning him down, Doron 
gave him the go-ahead to produce "Golden Gate Thrills," which featured a wild 
romp through the San Francisco Bay area on motorcycles, trolleys and 
speedboats. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very enthusiastic, and the timing was right," said Don Wenzinger, 
entertainment program development manager for Doron, which consequently hired 
Creative Reel to make three more action-packed films. "If he'd have called a 
year earlier, we would never have used him." 
</P>
<P>
The mild-mannered Goldschen doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would send a 
motorcycle through a fruit stand at high speed, but he did in 
"Cycle-Censation," another one of his Doron films. He also planted a camera on 
an out-of-control dune buggy in "Dune Demon" and fulfilled a whimsical 
childhood fantasy in "Go-Kart Blast." 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid, I used to ride go-carts and think, 'Wouldn't it be great to 
drive off the track and onto the street?' "' Goldschen recalled. "I'm sure I'm 
not the only one who's had that fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
Goldschen's three-minute joy rides had an average budget of $50,000 and 
required making special camera mounts and shock systems to maintain the point 
of view of the vehicle operator. As a result of the efforts of technicians and 
stunt drivers like Greg Brazil, Creative Reel's films have become the preferred 
selections in Doron's library of stunt films available to the 150 SR-2 owner's 
around the world, according to Wenzinger. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones Creative Reel have done are very popular. Jeff knew how to take the 
concept and really make it work," Wenzinger said. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem unlikely that a company such as Creative Reel would venture into 
making stunt films, but Goldschen said the first film he ever made -- and the 
one that got him his first job -- was an action documentary on hang gliding 
that he put together while a student at El Camino High School in Woodland 
Hills. It caught the attention of a member of the Mexican government who hired 
Goldschen to make a promotional film on sports fishing and other tourist 
attractions of Baja California. The film is still shown at fishing and outdoor 
sports conventions, Goldschen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was truly a snowball effect," said Goldschen of his beginnings. "You just 
have to get one film out there and get the right people to see it." 
</P>
<P>
After enrolling at CSUN, Goldschen formed Video Expressions -- renamed Creative 
Reel last year -- and acquired jobs throughout his college years. After 
graduating, word of mouth brought him more clients. He also began teaching film 
production courses at UCLA and at his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is where Gene Munger of Shell Oil went in 1981 to search for a filmmaker 
to do a piece about oil production for the company's Wilmington Manufacturing 
Complex in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just supposed to be about what goes on in our refinery," said Munger, 
Shell's West Coast manager of public affairs. "Jeff was the instructor for an 
extension course and agreed to do it along with his class." 
</P>
<P>
While working on the project, Goldschen and his students were struck by the 
close relationship of Carson residents with the plant. Instead of simply 
explaining the refinery process, Goldschen and his class created a more 
personal, seven-minute film focusing on the local residents and how they 
interact with the huge, sprawling plant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still the keystone of our communication program," Munger said of the film 
that is shown to community groups and refinery tours as well as Shell 
employees. "It's just as current today." 
</P>
<P>
Goldschen is most proud of his work with Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles and 
the National Cancer Institute, which hired him to create two productions that 
portray how leukemia victims and their families cope with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one was from a child's point of view and the second from the 
parents,' " said Goldschen, who worked with medical professionals on the 
project. "It was a very enlightening experience for me, very sad, and 
ultimately fulfilling." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very effective film," said Patricia Woody, project coordinator for the 
hospital. "The children are only between the ages of 3 and 12, but they respond 
to it." Woody said the films are shown nationally and have also been dubbed in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Creative Reel's assignments don't have the kind of high-powered content 
of the leukemia documentaries, and Goldschen is routinely challenged to make 
tedious tasks such as filling out bank forms interesting. But, according to 
Goldschen, even the most mundane subjects have many possibilities for 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wonderful about it is that we can play off of anything. We don't have 
to have an executive just talking on camera. We can play out a scenario," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mad on Arrival," a film he created for Security Pacific Bank, is one example. 
To illustrate how tellers can defuse situations involving irate bank customers, 
Goldschen filmed three skits in a style reminiscent of "Twilight Zone," in 
which actors playing enraged bank customers storm up to the teller demanding 
service. 
</P>
<P>
In one of Goldschen's latest projects, also for Security Pacific, comedian Ruth 
Buzzi plays a 4 1/2-inch Internal Revenue Service agent who comes to the aid of 
a bank employee struggling to fill out a complicated new tax document. 
</P>
<P>
"You can watch 'thirtysomething' and see there's a message. It's entertainment, 
but they're still giving you a message," Goldschen said. "We can do the same 
thing with our films." 
</P>
<P>
Although Creative Reel is nestled in Hollywood's back yard, Goldschen is in no 
hurry to join the big bucks, high-risk entertainment industry. But he does 
think feature films are in his future. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, I'd like to make small, esoteric films," he said, citing Sidney 
Lumet's "Twelve Angry Men" as the type of drama he prefers. "Single location, 
wonderful cast, wonderful script, those are the kind of projects we'd consider. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that film is a very effective tool."

APPARENT KIDNAP ATTEMPTS PUT PARENTS ON GUARD -- AND ON EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: ADULTS IN HERMOSA BEACH AND MANHATTAN BEACH TRY TO WARN THEIR CHILDREN 
WITHOUT WHIPPING UP HYSTERIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In her mind, Debbie Shaffer can hear the final bell ringing at Hermosa Valley 
School and see her 11-year-old daughter, Michelle, starting the long walk home. 
</P>
<P>
At the office where she works as an executive secretary, the young mother 
fidgets and watches the clock for the next half-hour, the time it takes for the 
little blonde girl to phone and say she has reached home -- safely. 
</P>
<P>
Only then will Shaffer relax. 
</P>
<P>
It's been that way for many parents in Hermosa Beach and neighboring Manhattan 
Beach since the first in a string of four apparent kidnaping attempts against 
schoolchildren was reported March 8. 
</P>
<P>
While unnerved by reports that a man in a pickup truck has approached 
youngsters in the communities, adults said they are relieved that years of 
training paid off and that all four children ran from the stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of child abuse are nothing new in the two beach cities, where residents 
have lived for years with the legacy of the McMartin Pre-School molestation 
case. Several of the "McMartin kids," as they are known, attend Hermosa Valley 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"The McMartin situation has pretty well sobered everyone to what can happen, 
even in a small community," said Richard Halliburton as he dropped his daughter 
off at Hermosa Valley School, where gates were locked Thursday to prevent 
strangers from coming onto campus.

A long line of cars dropped children off at the school Thursday morning. More 
parents have been escorting their children to campus in the past week, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A boy in a fluorescent surfing-style T-shirt and a girl lugging a book bag half 
her size nodded in silent agreement as their parents explained that they had 
warned their children to be increasingly wary of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to alert them without unduly alarming them about the danger," 
said one father. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said she had moved to Hermosa Beach three years ago to escape the gangs 
and drugs she feared her children might have encountered in Lawndale schools. 
"I wanted to get the kids in a good community and a good school, and then this 
happens," she said. "It makes me real nervous." 
</P>
<P>
She said she has come to realize that Hermosa Beach is not immune to the 
world's problems -- despite the illusion of insulation held out by high home 
prices, sea breezes and the easy beach life style. 
</P>
<P>
"Things do happen in nice neighborhoods," said another mother. "We are not 
exempt." 
</P>
<P>
Children at Hermosa Valley School discuss "stranger danger" and other social 
concerns at least once a week , said Shalee Cunningham, superintendent of the 
one-campus Hermosa Beach City School District. 
</P>
<P>
The four children approached since March 8 apparently learned their lessons 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents began that day when an 8-year-old walking home from Pacific 
Elementary School in Manhattan Beach was approached by a man in a white pickup 
truck. Over the next six days three more children -- two from Hermosa Valley 
School and one from Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach -- were 
approached by strangers in either a red or white pickup. All four children ran 
before the stranger could get close to them. 
</P>
<P>
Since each offered a slightly different description, police said they do not 
know whether they are looking for more than one man. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of phone calls with possible leads have poured in to the police. 
Plainclothes officers in both seaside cities are making special patrols around 
the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone in a red or white pickup gets a lot of attention," said Anthony Cotton, 
a crossing guard. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Valley School has taken an added precaution by locking two gates at the 
back of the campus that used to be open so residents could walk to and from the 
beach. Cunningham said the open-campus policy made it too difficult to 
distinguish legitimate visitors from those who might threaten children. 
</P>
<P>
Several parents said they are wary of the television news crews and reporters 
who have visited the community in the past week. They said the media, in the 
wake of McMartin, has unfairly painted the South Bay as an area possessed by 
hysteria over child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
"The press portrayed us as being hysterical," said one mother, who asked not to 
be named. "We don't want that to happen again. These are serious incidents."

DNA PRINTS HELP WIN CONVICTION IN 2 RAPES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: CRIMINAL TRIAL WAS THE FIRST IN L.A. COUNTY TO ALLOW GENETIC EVIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the first Los Angeles County criminal case to employ controversial DNA 
evidence, a 33-year-old man was found guilty Thursday of sexually assaulting 
two women, and jurors said later the verdict was based in part on so-called 
"genetic fingerprints" used to identify the defendant as the victims' 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
After six days of deliberations and a two-month trial that included elaborate 
technical testimony from some of the world's top DNA experts, a Van Nuys 
Superior Court jury found Henry Wilds guilty of 10 counts of rape, robbery, 
forcible oral copulation and burglary. The counts stemmed from two attacks in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Without the DNA evidence, the jury probably would have convicted Wilds only on 
one burglary count, jury foreman Patrick Shannon said. Even with the DNA 
evidence, the jury nearly deadlocked because one member was skeptical about the 
technique, said Shannon, a systems programmer with the Department of Water and 
Power. 
</P>
<P>
In genetic fingerprinting, DNA samples taken from evidence at a crime scene are 
analyzed and compared to DNA samples taken from a suspect's blood. The odds are 
then determined against another individual having the same pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Over defense objections, prosecutors obtained a court order to compare the DNA 
coding in samples of Wilds' blood to that of sperm found in the two victims' 
bodies. Maryland-based Sylmar Diagnostics, which performed the test, said there 
was only an infinitesimal chance that the sperm samples were not from Wilds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this means that DNA evidence is very convincing evidence for a jury," 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, who prosecuted Wilds. Wilds' attorney, Ralph 
J. Novotney Jr., was out of town attending a DNA seminar. His associate, Bruce 
Young, who appeared at the court hearing, said he was not familiar enough with 
the evidence to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The trial followed an even more lengthy hearing to determine whether DNA 
evidence is reliable enough and respected enough in the scientific community to 
be admissible as evidence under California law. The prosecutor, defense 
attorney and judge all said they "struggled with" the intricate scientific 
concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts claim that except for identical twins, the chances against two 
people having identical DNA structure are more than a billion to one. However, 
genetic fingerprinting has been criticized by some scientists as unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
Developed four years ago in Great Britain, DNA analysis is expected to someday 
become as important a forensic technique -- if not more so -- as 
fingerprinting, Novotney and Kahn said. DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, 
is found in all human tissue cells, such as blood, hair, skin and semen. 
Scientists say the genetic makeup of tissue can be translated into intricate 
DNA patterns that resemble supermarket bar codes. 
</P>
<P>
Juror William Cowell said that although he understood the basics of the 
technique, he and others on the panel found "the highly technical parts of it 
very confusing." Several jurors said they relied heavily on testimony from 
prosecution experts, whom they considered to be more credible than defense 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
Wilds was accused of assaulting and robbing a 30-year-old woman on Dec. 26, 
1986, in the underground garage of her apartment building, and of a nearly 
identical attack on a 27-year-old woman Feb. 22, 1987. Both attacks occurred in 
North Hollywood. He was arrested by Los Angeles police in April, 1987, after 
allegedly following a 28-year-old North Hollywood woman into the underground 
parking lot of her apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a 35-year-old Ventura woman became the first person in California 
to be convicted with genetic evidence after prosecutors used the DNA patterns 
in 15 strands of hair as evidence that she fatally stabbed a man at a Ventura 
hamburger stand in 1988. About 30 states now allow use of DNA evidence, Kahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although appeals are pending, no higher court has yet ruled on the technique's 
admissibility in trials. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge James. M. Coleman scheduled Wilds' sentencing for 
April 20. Prosecutors said that Wilds faces a maximum sentence of 53 years in 
prison.

BILL BOYARSKY: SETTING UP A DRY RUN FOR 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Mike Woo is known as a cautious man. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't always have that reputation. His political campaign managers had 
advertised him, ambitiously enough, as the '80s JFK, raising expectations that 
he'd sweep into the council with some of the daring of the man who handled the 
Cuban missile crisis. But once elected, Woo carefully avoided hot citywide 
issues. He immersed himself in his 13th District, which extends from the 
Hollywood flatlands over the Santa Monica Mountains to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the district added to his caution. Whether the cause is the 
Laurel Canyon dog park or opposition to Hollywood redevelopment, citizen groups 
in the 13th fight with the ferocity of urban guerrillas. Woo tried to walk a 
line between the raging forces. 
</P>
<P>
That's why it's a shock that Woo has volunteered for the city's most dangerous 
election year mission -- leader of the campaign to give council members a pay 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment does much more. It imposes strong, new conflict-of-interest laws 
on city officials and creates a strong enforcement mechanism. And it initiates 
public financing of city political campaigns. But if calls to talk shows are a 
barometer of public opinion, what people remember most is the pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
"Possible, but not easy" is how Woo describes his campaign's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Woo and other supporters are beginning to raise money for the charter amendment 
campaign. They expect help from Mayor Tom Bradley, an ironic touch considering 
how Bradley elevated ethics into a citywide issue by his own outside business 
activities. In an attempt to cool off the scandal, Bradley created the citizens 
ethics commission, with Cowan at the head. He embraced the commission's ethics 
package, and stuck with it through a City Council fight. 
</P>
<P>
The council refused to approve the ethics proposals and public financing of 
campaigns unless they got a pay raise out of it. Council President John Ferraro 
and Councilman Richard Alatorre insisted on that. Bradley said he'll refuse the 
raise, but other elected officials said they will take it. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raise could be a chief target of the package's opposition, but so far 
there has been no organized anti-campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is emerging as Woo's chief opponent in 
this fight. Yaroslavsky seems to think that an organized campaign against the 
package is not necessary. Because of the pay raise, he says, the package will 
sink itself. 
</P>
<P>
But with Woo moving into prominence, this is a fight Yaroslavsky can't afford 
to miss: The charter amendment campaign could well serve as a dry run for the 
1993 mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
That far-off mayoral race is expected to be the first in more than a quarter of 
a century in which Bradley, at last overtaken by age and scandal, won't be on 
the ballot. His departure would clear the way for Woo, Yaroslavsky and others. 
</P>
<P>
Woo and Yaroslovsky have much in common. Both are liberals. Both were active in 
the council's polite investigation of the Bradley affair. In fact, they fought 
each other for public attention during one period, each chairing heavily 
covered committee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
And like Woo, Yaroslavsky loves to avoid a good fight. The most famous example 
of that is when he collected large amounts of money for a challenge to Bradley 
in 1989, then pulled out when a public opinion poll showed him far behind. 
Given Bradley's troubles, and his drop in the polls at the end of the race, 
Yaroslovsky's decision turned out to be a historic missed opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Both have similar political bases. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's Jewish community roots give him a strong ethnic financial and 
voter base. His own Westside-San Fernando Valley 5th District and the 
neighboring 11th District are composed of voters with the highest turnouts in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Woo's district also has high turnout areas in the Hollywood Hills and in the 
Valley. And he, too, has an affluent and loyal ethnic base. The Asian community 
has provided him with votes and big contributions. He and Yaroslavsky may be 
the two best-financed candidates for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"We've clearly chosen sides on this issue," said Woo. For once, he has 
abandoned caution. Who knows what will actually happen if Woo can play the kind 
of daring politics that we expected from him at the beginning. Who knows if 
Yaroslavsky will see this fight through.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 INJURED IN EXPLOSION, FIRE AT SHELL 
REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two workers sustained minor injuries Thursday in a small explosion and brief 
fire at the Shell Oil refinery in Carson, company and county fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen workers were spattered with a solution containing sulfuric acid when 
the explosion took place, but 12 of them returned to work after taking showers, 
Shell spokesman Gene Munger said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured pair were treated at Long Beach Medical Clinic for minor acid 
exposure to the eyes and released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred shortly before 1 p.m. as a work crew performed routine 
maintenance on an out-of-service "alkylation" unit, which uses sulfuric acid in 
the production of high-octane unleaded gasoline, Munger said. Company 
firefighters had brought the blaze under control by the time Los Angeles County 
Fire Department units arrived shortly after 1 p.m., county fire Capt. Anthony 
Cardullo said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is under investigation, Munger said.

RABBIS SEEK TO POSTPONE SPRAYING; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: COUNCILMAN WACHS JOINS APPEAL FOR GOVERNOR TO HALT TONIGHT'S MALATHION 
TREATMENT IN VALLEY SO JEWS CAN WALK TO SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Joel Wachs and four San Fernando Valley rabbis appealed 
Thursday to Gov. George Deukmejian to postpone tonight's Valley malathion 
spraying, protesting that "insensitive" scheduling is forcing thousands of Jews 
to choose between a potential health risk and attending Sabbath services. 
</P>
<P>
But an official overseeing the state's anti-Medfly project said the Department 
of Food and Agriculture would make no exceptions -- especially after the 
barrage of criticism it received for exempting the Crystal Cathedral in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish leaders had angrily noted at their news conference the exemption 
given the landmark Protestant church in Garden Grove. The Crystal Cathedral, 
headquarters of evangelist Robert Schuller, was omitted from a malathion 
spraying area Jan. 25 because 2,700 ministers were attending a leadership 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs told the news conference at Temple Adat Ari El in North Hollywood that he 
could not "think of a greater insensitivity" than Friday night's spraying. "It 
flies in the face of time-honored practices." 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, religious freedom has become an issue in the Medfly 
program," he wrote in a letter faxed to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Deukmejian said the letter had just been received Thursday 
and that his office had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Isi Siddiqui, an assistant director of the Department of Food and 
Agriculture, had rejected Wachs' request on Tuesday. He said Thursday the 
department is still smarting from its last attempt to accommodate a religious 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Crystal Cathedral, we had lots of adverse publicity -- so much so we 
had to decide that this was a one-time exemption and would not happen again," 
he said. "We learned a difficult lesson. We tried to be good guys, but we got a 
lot of criticism from others saying we were playing favorites." 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui added that Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays are generally exempt from 
malathion spraying as a concession to weekend activities. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood, Sun Valley, and Studio City -- an area Wachs said has at least 
nine synagogues -- are part of a 47-square-mile area of the Valley to be 
sprayed tonight. The spraying was rescheduled because of Monday's rain. 
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Jews live in the Valley, according to the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said the area includes at least three Orthodox synagogues, whose members 
walk to services because they are forbidden to drive on the Sabbath. Many 
Conservative Jews also walk to services out of respect for tradition, said the 
rabbis, who noted that the state has advised residents to stay indoors during 
sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
Although Food and Agriculture officials insist malathion is harmless to humans 
in the dosages being applied, opponents claim it irritates eyes and throats and 
may cause unknown, long-term harm. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 mothers attended Thursday's news conference with their toddlers, 
carrying signs such as "Don't Spray Where Our Children Play."

WAITRESS' SUIT ACCUSES 2 POSH RESTAURANTS OF SEX BIAS IN HIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Two upper crust Los Angeles restaurants were served a sex discrimination 
lawsuit Thursday by an experienced waitress who claims she was denied 
employment because of her sex. 
</P>
<P>
The class action suit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, was filed by 
Kellye McKinna, 29, against Citrus Restaurant and the Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel 
and Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
McKinna, who is seeking her doctorate at UCLA in educational psychology, said 
that while working for eight months at a less formal, lower-tipping restaurant 
at the Westside hotel, she "repeatedly requested" a transfer to its posh Ma 
Maison Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
However, her requests were denied, she claimed in legal papers filed in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, because Ma Maison maintains "a policy whereby female 
waitpersons are prohibited in the formal dining room." 
</P>
<P>
McKinna, who has waited tables at several other eateries in Los Angeles and 
Seattle while pursuing her graduate studies, said she has since quit her job at 
the hotel's La Cajole restaurant and taken a part-time position as a banquet 
waitress at the Four Seasons Hotel near Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In her suit, McKinna claims she also applied for a job at the trendy Citrus in 
late 1988 but was rejected there too because she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"In a city where it is conceivable for a waiter to make up to $50,000 a year," 
McKinna said at a lunchtime news conference with her attorney outside Ma 
Maison, "it is absolutely unfair that women of equal experience and ability 
have been completely frozen out of almost all of the most expensive restaurants 
at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"Women deserve the right to support themselves," added McKinna, who was dressed 
in a waitress outfit. ". . . We should not be limited only to positions as 
coffee shop waitresses." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carcieri, controller of Ma Maison Sofitel, acknowledged Thursday that 
no waitresses work the lucrative evening shift at Ma Maison restaurant. He 
added that he believed there were some "gray areas with respect to her 
(McKinna's) request for a transfer" and that the hotel's "attorneys are 
reviewing all of the facts." Carcieri had no further comment, referring 
questions to an attorney, Dawn Kitagawa. Kitagawa had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Jacques Retourne, general manager of Citrus, denied Thursday that his 
restaurant has a policy against employing waitresses. The Melrose Avenue 
restaurant currently has one waitress who works evenings, "and it has nothing 
to do with the lawsuit," Retourne said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The longtime Los Angeles restaurateur said the city's finest restaurants have 
traditionally hired male waiters exclusively "for the simple fact that (women) 
never came around asking for jobs." 
</P>
<P>
"We get lawsuits here for the most unbelievable things," Retourne added. "The 
only thing that will be gained in this case is by the silly attorney who will 
get personal fame." 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, McKinna's attorney, Gloria Allred, served copies of the 
lawsuit to reporters from a silver platter also adorned with an iris in a dark 
blue vase. 
</P>
<P>
Allred, who has previously filed sex discrimination cases on issues ranging 
from clothing alteration charges to the failure of a high school student to win 
a spot on a cheerleading squad because of the size of her breasts, also spoke 
at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
'We believe that many restaurants have hired only men because they think it 
adds prestige and importance to the restaurant to only employ men at night," 
she contended. "Such practices serve only to perpetuate the false notion that 
women are of no value." 
</P>
<P>
Allred said many restaurants exclude women by relying on word-of-mouth 
recruitment by male waiters or by falsely telling women that no positions are 
available. She called for federal officials to launch their own investigation 
of the alleged abuses.

SCANDAL UNLEASHES WAVE OF ANGER AND SADNESS IN SHERIFF'S DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sgt. Jim Hannon is from the old school. His life has been one of values, of 
duty, patriotism and honor. He's actually proud of the uniform he wears bearing 
the green and gold seal of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was Thursday that he found himself filled with anger and sadness, 
hurt to the core by reports about the widening money-skimming scandal involving 
the department's elite narcotics squads. 
</P>
<P>
"My father retired from this department and this whole thing has made me mad as 
hell," said Hannon, a supervisor at the Hall of Justice jail in downtown Los 
Angeles. "Corruption has always been something that happened back East, in New 
York or Chicago, not here. We are talking about what we stand for, what we are, 
and it makes me angry." 
</P>
<P>
For Hannon and others in the 7,500-member Sheriff's Department, new revelations 
about the extensive sweep of the investigation into the narcotics unit served 
as yet another body blow to a department that has been struggling to overcome 
its tainted public image. The latest allegations, disclosed in affidavits 
unsealed Wednesday by federal investigators, alleged that the theft of drug 
money seized by narcotics officers has been a widespread practice in the 
department and has involved members of three elite narcotics squads. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavits, filed by FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents, said that 
narcotics officers could have been stealing money from suspected drug dealers 
and money launderers as far back as the mid-1980s. Ten Sheriff's Department 
narcotics officers, including all nine members of the sheriff's major narcotics 
teams, have been indicted for allegedly stealing more than $1.4 million from 
suspected drug traffickers and money launderers over the last two years alone. 
</P>
<P>
In the fraternity of law enforcement, the new disclosures came as a stinging 
rebuke. And they prompted unsettling questions -- from friends, from strangers, 
from themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers chose to close ranks, opting to defend their colleagues as 
innocent until proven otherwise. Others, like Hannon, reacted with hurt, 
sadness and anger. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our members have been accused of violating the law, in an underhanded 
way, like a thief," said Hannon, a 14-year department veteran who spent 12 
years in the Army, including four tours in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"This reflects on the entire department, on everyone," he said. "When I walk 
into the court to testify, it is my background and integrity on the line. From 
now on any officer from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department who walks 
into a court will face someone in there, maybe on the jury, who is going to 
remember what has happened. And I resent that." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Lynda Edmonds of the sheriff's Information Bureau called the incident a 
deeply troubling experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We all raise our hands and swear we'll do everything to support the community 
and carry out the law," she said. "When we realize that those who have taken 
the same oath have not upheld it, there is a tremendous sense of embarrassment. 
You ask yourself: 'How can they do this to us?' " 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shinee, attorney for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the 
organization that represents most of the rank-and-file officers, said many 
officers were having difficulty dealing with the case, especially because the 
department has been relatively free of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is unique," he said. "Law enforcement is usually not faced with such 
sweeping allegations like this. The reaction (among officers) are as diverse as 
one can imagine. There are members out there who are outraged and others who 
don't believe it for a second. Others just want to wait and see what happens 
when the smoke clears." 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Sgt. Pete Fosselman, a 16-year veteran who works as a patrol 
sergeant in the Temple City sheriff's station, said he was reluctant to discuss 
the case "unless I am questioned about it. My parents have brought up the 
subject. I tell them the Sheriff's Department is a large organization and the 
possibility exists that a few bad apples do exist. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is very tragic and sad because there is a lot of good people 
here. We'll just have to wait and see what happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Deputy Richard Sloan, who worked narcotics until he retired in May, 
1985, expressed outrage over the scandal. He said it would be the honest 
officers who would have to live with the image of the bad cop. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of this, every single law enforcement officer is going to have to 
defend himself," said Sloan, who knows some of the officers under 
investigation. "I feel very defensive about this. It indicts every honest 
police officer out there." 
</P>
<P>
Sloan, who is now on the executive board of the 5,000-member California 
Narcotics Officers Assn., speculated that the narcotics units' problems began 
when a number of veteran supervisors either retired or transferred at the same 
time that Colombian traffickers were beginning to bring drugs and bundles of 
cash into the county. 
</P>
<P>
"When you work in narcotics there is a lot of freedom, making decisions by 
yourself, and if you don't have good supervision things can happen to you," 
Sloan said. "What puzzles me is how nine or 10 people working on a crew 
together could conspire to do this without someone feeling the way that I do. 
The sad part of it was that there were probably people there who knew this was 
going on and didn't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
As bad as the investigation and accompanying publicity seem now, Senior Deputy 
R. Haney at the Hall of Justice jail believes it will pass. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of us who work on a daily basis to make the system work, it is very 
disheartening," said Haney, who will retire next year after more than 30 years 
with the department. "We'll overcome this. There are too many good apples out 
there. You have to look forward to better things."

LIONS WILL TRY TO KEEP HEADS IN THIS GAME; 
</P>
<P>
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT: EMOTIONS FIGURE TO BE RUNNING HIGH IN TONIGHT'S FIRST-ROUND 
MATCHUP AGAINST NEW MEXICO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their first game after Hank Gathers' death the last time they were on the 
court March 4, the Loyola Marymount Lions may have to control themselves as 
much as New Mexico State to win tonight's opening-round game in the NCAA 
basketball tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (23-5) go into the 8:30 contest in an emotional state that Coach Paul 
Westhead has tried to address all week in practice. But he isn't sure what to 
expect at tip-off, other than an outpouring of crowd support. Might they try 
too hard? 
</P>
<P>
"That's something we need to be conscious of," Westhead said. "It's easy to 
tell a team to relax. You can't do that in this circumstance. You have to allow 
the natural run of feelings . . . the (frantic) way we play you can tend to 
forget yourself. I'm hoping that works to our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Junior swing man Tom Peabody doesn't think the team will try to do too much, 
but admitted he isn't sure what to expect, either. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready," he said. "This is very hard. None of us has been through this 
before . . . dealing with it in our own way. We've got a lot of emotion going. 
Coach wants us to make sure we use the emotions the right way. If we come out 
and go crazy, foul all over the place, it will be a mess. We've gotta play 
within ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola coaches expect talented New Mexico State (26-4) to run with the 
Lions, at least for a while. The Lions go into the game averaging a 
record-shattering 124.8 points, and they managed to continue scoring points in 
Gathers' absence in December, when he sat out for three weeks after fainting. 
Bo Kimble, who leads the nation in scoring at 35.3 points a game, went on a 
scoring tear in that stretch, averaging nearly 46. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, making their first NCAA appearance since 1979, scored more than 100 
points four times and defeated Nevada Las Vegas along the way to their 
second-best record, under fifth-year Coach Neil McCarthy. All five starters 
average double figures, led by guard Keith Hill at 13.4 and center James 
Anderson and guard Randy Brown at 13.2 each. Forwards Reggie Jordan and Michael 
New average 10 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Hill were All-Big West first-teamers, and Anderson has had two 
30-point games recently. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola coaches characterize the Aggies as "very athletic." The teams match 
up well in size, with no starters taller than 6-feet-9. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-9 player is Loyola sophomore Chris Knight, who finds himself stepping in 
for Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably sees himself as Hank's replacement. It's not an enviable spot to 
be in," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, who were a remarkably loose team with Gathers at the center of much 
of the merriment, have shown the strain at times since his death. John 
O'Connell is sporting several stitches and a black eye, courtesy of teammate 
Terrell Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead called their scuffle during practice this week "a quick five-second 
release," adding, "The guys have done a terrific job of helping each other."

TV-RADIO: GREG GUMBEL GETS A TOUGH CALL -- LMU AFTER ITS TRAGIC LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In mid-January, two weeks after Greg Gumbel began doing sports for "CBS This 
Morning," he was sent out to Loyola Marymount to do a piece on Hank Gathers and 
Bo Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Sports Information Director Barry Zepel telling us we were going to 
love these guys, that they were bright, personable and a pleasure to be 
around," Gumbel said. 
</P>
<P>
"And he was 100% right. I got to know Gathers pretty well, so the news of his 
death hit me pretty hard." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Gumbel will be the play-by-play announcer for Loyola's NCAA tournament 
game against New Mexico State, which is being televised by CBS. Quinn Buckner 
will be the commentator. 
</P>
<P>
The game will be on Channel 2 live at 8:30, and at 11:30 in the rest of the 
nation -- delayed in the West, live in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll address the Gathers story at the top of the telecast," Gumbel said. "But 
once the game starts, for the most part we'll try to treat it as New Mexico 
State vs. Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course there will be times when we'll have to mention the Gathers 
situation, but we don't want to beat the story into the ground and take away 
from the game." 
</P>
<P>
For most of his career, Gumbel, 43, was best known as the brother of Bryant, 
who is 1 1/2 years younger. 
</P>
<P>
But the older Gumbel is establishing his own identity and becoming recognized 
for his own abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Bryant, host of NBC's "Today" morning show, skyrocketed to network 
stardom, Greg took a little slower route. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Loras College, a Division III school in Dubuque, Iowa, Greg 
Gumbel was working as a sales clerk for a hospital supply company in Detroit in 
1973 when he got his first broadcasting job. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, working as a weekend sportscaster at KNBC at the time, suggested that 
Greg apply for a job as a weekend sportscaster at WMAQ in Chicago. He got the 
job and spent 7 1/2 years at WMAQ, followed by 5 1/2 at ESPN and a couple with 
the Madison Square Garden Network before becoming full time at CBS last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
There are plans to use Gumbel as a fill-in for Harry Smith on "CBS This 
Morning" when Smith is on vacation. That means the Gumbels would be going 
head-to-head -- Greg on CBS, Bryant on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel and wife Marcy live in New York. They have a 21-year-old daughter, 
Michelle, who attends Roger Williams College outside Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel, who says Michelle isn't much of a sports fan, tells this story about 
her: 
</P>
<P>
"She and a couple of friends came to the East Regionals in Providence last year 
after I offered her some tickets. That was the day Georgetown had to come from 
behind to beat Notre Dame, and then North Carolina State beat Iowa in double 
overtime in a tremendous game. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter called the next day to say how much she enjoyed the 
Georgetown-Notre Dame game. I said, 'But what about that double overtime game? 
Wasn't that something?' 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Oh, was there a second game?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kudos to KCBS for preempting network programming to bring L.A. fans today's 
UCLA and Loyola Marymount games live. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting the network to allow us to push back 'Dallas' and 'Falcon Crest' to 
11:30 p.m. was a real coup," said the station's Lisa DeLucia. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola-New Mexico State wasn't quite a sellout late Thursday, so KCBS 
guaranteed it would buy up any remaining tickets in order to ensure the game 
could be televised live. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's game against Alabama Birmingham will be on at 4 p.m., with Ralph Hacker 
and Dan Belluomini reporting. It will be shown again on ESPN at 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS also deserves praise for taking steps to ensure that last Sunday's NCAA 
pairings announcement show did not have to be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
To do it, the station eliminated the halftime of the Pacific 10 tournament 
final, which was shown on a half-hour delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the viewer at home only cares about what he sees on the air," said Jay 
Strong, the director of programming. "But I can tell you that, behind the 
scenes, we went to a lot of trouble and financial sacrifice to make sure the 
Pac-10 telecast ended in time." 
</P>
<P>
Michaels update: Al Michaels, through a spokesman, said he has no comment 
regarding his reported suspension by Dennis Swanson, ABC Sports president. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Michaels wants to put it all behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels reportedly was suspended for two weeks to a month because his teen-age 
daughter worked as a messenger at a figure skating event last month, which is 
apparently against ABC's policy on nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
But Michaels was not scheduled to work during the suspension period, so 
suspension might be the wrong word. 
</P>
<P>
In a new development Thursday, it has been learned that the production 
assistant who had hired Michaels' daughter was suspended without pay for two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting aspect of the Michaels story is that such strong measures 
were taken for such a minor offense. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder what is really going on between Swanson and his top 
sportscaster. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, back in 1986 and '87, had several run-ins with another top 
sportscaster, Jim Lampley. 
</P>
<P>
Lampley left the network abruptly after a meeting with Swanson, and was 
unemployed for a couple of weeks before landing a job with KCBS, where he has 
since become a news anchorman. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
There will be seven NCAA tournament games televised by CBS this weekend -- four 
Saturday and three Sunday. CBS is planning to televise both UCLA and Loyola 
Marymount on Sunday, provided both win tonight. However, if Loyola plays Sunday 
in Long Beach, its game may not be televised if it doesn't sell out 24 hours in 
advance. If Loyola doesn't play Sunday, CBS' first NCAA telecast probably will 
start at 9 a.m. Otherwise, the first telecast will be at 11 a.m. . . . NBC 
commentator Al McGuire, on Dick Vitale: "He's built a cult following. He's not 
of this earth. If (ABC partner) Keith Jackson doesn't have a twitch by now, 
he's an amazing man." And: "It's too late for him now. He has to stay with his 
style. He's a smart guy and in great physical shape. I do 15 games a year, he 
does 15 a week. And I don't shout a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Attention boxing fans: The Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor fight on HBO 
Saturday night at 7 figures to be outstanding. Ross Greenburg, HBO's executive 
producer of sports, said that promos for this fight originally called it "the 
fight of the year." Said Greenburg: "Then we got blindsided by Buster Douglas, 
so we had to change our promos. But this is certainly the second-best fight of 
the year." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 9's news-block format is not exactly off to a roaring start. Although 
the Lakers' telecast from Charlotte last Monday got a peak Nielsen rating of 
14.6 near the end, the rating for the 2 1/2 hours of news that followed slipped 
considerably. The station averaged a .6 rating for the 10-to-11 p.m. hour. . . 
. Turner Broadcasting has announced that its NFL football will be carried on 
TNT rather than TBS, as previously announced. . . . Turner has also announced 
that 24 World Cup soccer games June 8 through July 8 will be televised on TNT. 
The first U.S. game is June 10 against Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's NHRA Winternationals at Pomona will be televised on NBC Saturday 
at noon. The announcers are Fred Roggin, Don Garlits and Steve Evans. . . . 
Thanks to Prime Ticket, SportsChannel and ESPN, there is baseball on TV this 
weekend -- college baseball. During Prime Ticket's coverage of tonight's 7 
o'clock Cal-USC game, the crowd may look a little strange. As part of USC's 
Comedy Day, Groucho Marx glasses will be handed out to those in attendance. 
Announcers Tom Kelly and Steve Garvey may even don them. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Sports, as part of a new marketing ploy, is in the midst of a shopping mall 
tour. It makes its eighth stop at the Northridge Fashion Center, from 10 a.m. 
to 9 p.m. today and Saturday, and noon to 6 p.m. Sunday. Called the "Dream 
Season National Tour," it features exhibits and games. Shoppers are invited to 
compete in such things as shooting a basketball, hitting a tennis ball at a 
target, and chipping a golf ball, or answering trivia questions. Various 
prizes, such as CBS hats and sweat shirts, are handed out. "The idea behind 
this is to get people to come out to our sponsors' stores," said Mike Nowacki, 
CBS Sports' vice president of marketing. "And it's gone over pretty well. We've 
so far drawn at least 25% more people than normal."

The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team will be in familiar territory, when 
it plays host to North Dakota in the NCAA Division II quarterfinals at 7:30 
tonight at Pomona's Kellogg Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, ranked No. 2 in Division II with a 27-3 record, will be playing in the 
Division II quarterfinals for the eighth time in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will also be trying for their second consecutive berth in the 
division's final four. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams will take long winning streaks into the game. Pomoma has won 20 
games in a row and North Dakota 14. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which has won three Division II titles and finished second three times 
in nine seasons in the division, has been led by All American center Niki 
Bracken and forward Marcine Edmonds. Bracken averages 19.3 points and 9.5 
rebounds and Edmonds 13.8 points and 6.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
North Dakota, which also has a 27-3 record and is ranked No. 4, has relied on 
the outside shooting of guards Durene Heisler and Whitney Meier, each of who 
averages better than 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will advance to the final four March 23 and 24 at a site to be 
announced Sunday. Mitch Polin

Top-ranked Oklahoma, fighting for its tournament life against No. 16 seed 
Towson State, survived a sluggish effort Thursday for a 77-68 victory over the 
Tigers in the opening game of the NCAA Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Jones scored 19 points for the Sooners (27-4), who advance to Saturday's 
second round Saturday against the winner of Thursday's North Carolina and 
Southwest Missouri State game. Towson State, winner of the East Coast 
Conference tournament, ended its season 18-13. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, a top-seeded Sooners' team received a major scare in the Southeast 
Regional, rallying from a 17-point deficit to beat East Tennessee State 72-71 
in a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
Against Towson State the Sooners never trailed, but there were some anxious 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 12 at halftime, Towson State outscored the Sooners 6-2 to move 
within 47-39. Later, a three-minute scoring drought by Oklahoma allowed the 
Tigers to come within 58-54 with 8:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
Kurk Lee, who finished with 30 points, scored 14 of the Tigers' first 25 points 
after halftime, including six in a row as they climbed to 60-58 with 6:45 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But 3-pointers by Terry Evans and Smokey McCovery widened the Sooners' lead to 
66-60 with 5:21 left, and Evans added another 3-pointer with 1:41 left that 
made the score 73-67. Towson State got no closer than five after that. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first appearance in the NCAA tournament for Towson State. Oklahoma 
is making its eighth straight tournament appearance, a Big Eight Conference 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma led 45-33 after a first half that saw the Sooners commit 11 turnovers 
and miss 12-of-18 free throws. Towson State shot 34 percent and was assessed 
two technicals -- one against Lee for hanging on the rim after missing a dunk, 
and one against Coach Terry Truax for arguing a charging call. 
</P>
<P>
That call erased a dunk by Chuck Lightening that would have brought the Tigers 
within eight points with four minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma looked early as though it would roll over Towson State, taking a 12-2 
lead in the first 3 minutes, 30 seconds. But the Tigers settled down and scored 
the next nine points. 
</P>
<P>
An 19-6 run by the Sooners during the next seven minutes, however, gave them a 
31-17 lead. The run could have been greater, but Oklahoma missed six straight 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 83, Southwest Missouri State 70 -- Fat chance. That's what North 
Carolina coach Dean Smith says his Tar Heels have against top-ranked Oklahoma 
in the second-round of the NCAA Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels' win over Southwest Missouri State in Thursday's opening round 
was barely over before Smith appraised Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"They could blow us out," Smith said of the Sooners, seeded first in the 
Midwest and ranked No. 1 in the nation. "A lot of people won't give us a 
chance. I'd rather have been in the eastern regional. It will be interesting to 
see if the (Texas) fans really dislike Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Fox scored 17 points, including a pair of key 3-pointers, and Scott 
Williams provided the inside punch as the Tar Heels (20-12) advanced to a 
second-round meeting with the Sooners on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"This game should do a great deal for our confidence," Smith said of the 
victory, which gave the Tar Heels 20 straight 20-victory seasons. "We'll need 
it going against the No. 1 team." 
</P>
<P>
Williams had 18 points for the Tar Heels and played a strong defensive game 
before fouling out with 2:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We had planned to pound it inside and use our size advantage," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels, bounced out of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament in the 
first round, built a 64-58 lead with 8:20 left on a 3-pointer by Fox. But the 
Bears cut the deficit to 66-63 before Fox struck again for a 3-pointer with 
4:51 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Rick hit two very big baskets," Smith said. "They were very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Fox said he got room because the Bears sagged on Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd work it inside and if Williams was cover he'd just pop it back outside," 
Fox said. "We played like a team. We had to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ford led the Bears (22-7) with a career-high 25 points. But he had only 
six in the second half due to foul trouble. Ford missed almost six minutes 
after being tagged with his fourth foul with 14:25 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I was guarding Williams and I was worn out by the end of the game," Ford said. 
"He's 6-6 and I'm 6-11. It was hard to force him out." 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt us when Ford fouled out," coach Charlie Spoonhour said. "He got those 
fouls trying to guard bigger people. North Carolina is very good. That really 
shouldn't be a secret."

<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Klein named one of his horses Contempt. The colt ran 10th in the Breeders' 
Cup Juvenile at Hollywood Park in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Named after a sportswriter?" a sportswriter asked Klein. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Klein said. "Al Davis." 
</P>
<P>
The money was one thing, but Klein enjoyed even more the chance to rattle Al 
Davis' cage in a lawsuit that he won and then lost after an appeal. Klein, who 
had a history of heart trouble, promised that any money awarded from Davis, the 
operator of the Los Angeles-Oakland Raiders, would be contributed to cardiac 
research. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter who interviewed Klein shortly after the former owner of the San 
Diego Charger got into racing quoted him as saying that he had heart trouble 
because he wasn't taking care of himself and was 40 pounds overweight. Since 
Klein's suit suggested that Davis' antitrust action against the National 
Football League had brought on Klein's heart attack, Davis' attorneys took a 
deposition from the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"Davis' people are desperate," Klein said with characteristic bluster one day 
at Santa Anita. "By the way, what is it that was said that they're so excited 
about?" 
</P>
<P>
Told of the quote, Klein said: "Did I really say that? Maybe it was said in a 
different context." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, there was a horse named Al Davis running in New York. Somebody 
should have scheduled a match race between Al Davis and Contempt. 
</P>
<P>
The match that did come off was Klein with Wayne Lukas, the trainer who spent 
millions of Klein's money at horse auctions, and gave Klein more thrills at 
race tracks than he ever had in football stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Lukas threw an expensive party in the back yard of his 
luxurious home near Santa Anita, inviting perhaps 500 people to a sit-down 
dinner that was eaten while a full orchestra played. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the evening, Gene Klein got a big smile on his face and said: "Why am I 
having such a good time? I'm the guy who's really paying for all this." 
</P>
<P>
Klein was one of those rare owners who could actually match Lukas word for 
word, no small achievement. After they had won the Kentucky Derby in 1988 with 
Winning Colors, the filly was bumped repeatedly by Forty Niner, the Derby 
runner-up, in a roughly run Preakness. While Forty Niner and Winning Colors 
were bouncing off one another, Risen Star won the race. 
</P>
<P>
While Klein and his jockey, Gary Stevens, heatedly criticized trainer Woody 
Stephens and jockey Pat Day for the way Forty Niner was ridden, Lukas retreated 
from the furor, in one of his rare silent postures. Klein said that Day would 
never ride any of his horses again, a threat that had disintegrated by the end 
of summer. 
</P>
<P>
But Klein sure used the Preakness incident to stir up the racing Establishment. 
The Daily Racing Form, which takes an editorial stand about every millennium, 
sided with Klein and censured Stephens for poor sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Envious of Klein's immediate racing successes, some horsemen said that he 
bought his way in, but Lukas says that is an oversimplification. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we paid top dollar for horses," Lukas said. "But there were more 
important factors. Gene came into this game using the same positive business 
principles that worked for him in other areas. And we were both driven by the 
need to succeed at what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
There are many plutocrats in racing, people richer than even Gene Klein. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing people have said for years that money can't buy success," said Tommy 
Trotter, racing secretary at Gulfstream Park. "But Klein did, and he's the only 
one I know that did. And it's amazing what success he had in just a few years." 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Klein and Lukas talked on the phone and scheduled a lunch date for 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"You sound tired, Gene," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I feel great," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours later, Klein was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Has there ever been a $500,000 race in which all of the horses have been beaten 
in their previous starts? 
</P>
<P>
That is the case here Saturday for the Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park. The 
nine-horse field in the 1 1/8-mile stake has this lineup: 
</P>
<P>
Ross's Warning, eighth in the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream in his last 
start, with Richard Migliore riding; Sunny Serve, fourth in the FOY, Nick 
Petro; Top Snob, 11th in the FOY, Jerry Bailey; Unbridled, third in the FOY, 
Pat Day; Country Day, second in an allowance at Gulfstream, Doug Valiente; 
Roanoke, fifth in the FOY, Craig Perret; Run Turn, seventh in the FOY, Earlie 
Fires; Slavic, sixth in the FOY, Jose Santos; Single Dawn, third in the El 
Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows, Laffit Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
The $50,000 Swale Stakes, a seven-furlong race that will be run earlier on the 
Florida Derby program, could turn out to be a more significant Kentucky Derby 
prep. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, undefeated in five races as a 2-year-old but a colt whose 
training in Florida has been compromised by a bleeding problem, is the 8-5 
favorite, but Housebuster, a superior sprinter, and Senor Pete, the Belmont 
Futurity winner making his first start as a 3-year-old, are formidable 
opponents. Thirty Six Red, Johnny Ross and Cox's Enchante complete the 
six-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally, who will be at Gulfstream Saturday to saddle Single Dawn, 
is leaning toward starting Silver Ending in the San Felipe Handicap at Santa 
Anita Sunday, even though the speed-favoring track will work against the $1,500 
yearling's running style. . . . Top Cash is the 2-1 favorite in the 11-horse, 
$250,000 Remington Park Derby on Saturday, and Smelly is the 8-5 favorite over 
eight rivals in the $200,000 Federico Tesio at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
In another Kentucky Derby prep, Burnt Hills, a California shipper, runs Sunday 
in the $150,000 Louisiana Derby at the Fair Grounds. Another California 
invader, Forty Niner Days, will not run after a slow workout over the New 
Orleans track. . . . There's a glaring oversight on the ballot for the Racing 
Hall of Fame: Pat Day, a three-time Eclipse Award winner, isn't among the 
jockey candidates. Day rode his first winner the year before Chris McCarron 
started his career, and McCarron was elected in 1989, the first year he was 
eligible. The jockeys on this year's ballot are Don Brumfield, Eddie 
Delahoussaye, Sandy Hawley, Larry Snyder and Jorge Velasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Among horses, John Henry is on the ballot for the first time, along with Arts 
and Letters, High Gun, Hill Prince and Noor. And McAnally, John Henry's 
trainer, is also eligible. Other trainers on the ballot are Phil Johnson, Tommy 
Kelly, Willard Proctor and Tennessee Wright. In the contemporary female 
category, eligible horses are All Along, Bold 'n Determined, Parlo, Princess 
Rooney and Royal Native. 
</P>
<P>
In the horses-of-yesteryear category, the eligibles are Bimelech, Black Helen, 
Borrow, Cavalcade and Morvich. . . . Unlike baseball, which has a better 
system, only one candidate from each category can be elected into the racing 
hall each year.

HOUSTON CONTENT WITH LABEL

<TEXT>
<P>
Everything anyone needs to know about the Houston Rockets can be summarized by 
the results of two season series. The Rockets have won two of three games 
against the Los Angeles Lakers. They have lost two of three to the Minnesota 
Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
This is the sort of craziness and inconsistency that has led the Rockets into 
believing they are an exceptional franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Sound strange? It should, but then the Rockets' nearly won the 1981 world 
championship with a mediocre team that was 40-42 during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Understanding that makes it easy to understand why the Rockets were so excited 
last summer when they signed re-instated drug offenders Mitchell Wiggins and 
Lewis Lloyd and free agent Larry Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Rockets officials were certain that those ingenious maneuvers made them 
legitimate contenders for the championship -- not favorites, but contenders. In 
their most optimistic moments, Rockets officials predicted 52 victories, which 
led to theories that they had been sniffing fumes from the polluted Houston 
Ship Channel. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the NBA, however, awaited the explosion of the talented time bomb, 
Akeem Olajuwon, because when it became obvious to Olajuwon that the Rockets 
were merely a mediocre team, there would be an eruption. 
</P>
<P>
And, there was. In fact, there were several. Olajuwon even mentioned the 
unthinkable in Houston -- if the Rockets could not duplicate the rebuilding 
success stories of teams like the Phoenix Suns and San Antonio Spurs, he wanted 
to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
"He's changed," Rockets Coach Don Chaney said. "He knows now that if he's going 
to win a championship, it's going to be in Houston because we're not going to 
trade him." 
</P>
<P>
To Olajuwon's credit, he channeled his frustration into outstanding play. The 
Rockets recently won six consecutive games, and in that stretch, Olajuwon 
averaged 31.5 points, 14 rebounds, a staggering 7.1 blocked shots and 2.7 
steals a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Akeem is a winner," Chaney said. "He has been frustrated and he's aired that 
to the public, but it doesn't affect his game. In fact, he takes his game to 
another level." 
</P>
<P>
And it is precisely that habit that scares the hell out of the rest of the 
Western Conference. Unlike the New York Knicks, who are 6-17 vs. the nine 
winningest teams in the league, the Rockets have relative success against the 
best. In games against the top 10 teams, adding the Knicks, the Rockets are 
10-13. 
</P>
<P>
"If Akeem keeps playing like Superman," said Lakers coach Pat Riley, "this team 
is on its way." 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets' primary problem, besides Olajuwon's poor supporting cast, is that 
they can't win on the road, where, at 6-25 prior to Thursday night's visit to 
Sacramento, they have won exactly one more game than the 5-25 Miami Heat. If 
the Rockets do make the playoffs, and they currently would not qualify because 
they have the ninth best record, they obviously would not have the home court 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
If they do make it, however, they could be as dangerous as the 40-42 team that 
took the Boston Celtics to six games before losing in the 1981 NBA Finals. 
Franchise history, and the presence of Olajuwon, suggests the Rockets are just 
average enough to be a playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Jackson and Al Bianchi will be interested in hearing Don Chaney's 
assessment of how Olajuwon has developed in another area. "I tell you what I 
like about the big guy," Chaney said. "I wasn't aware that he was able to do 
this. Last year, I made him the captain. He's one of those guys who doesn't 
like to voice his opinion to his teammates and get them going from a leadership 
standpoint. But this year, he's become more of a vocal leader. Last year, he 
led by demonstration, by the way he played. But this year, he's talking to his 
teammates and boosting their confidence. I had no idea he was capable of doing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks keep saying they need a leader, preferably Patrick Ewing. But Ewing 
prefers to lead by example. Perhaps, like Olajuwon, he can change. There is 
little doubt that Ewing is the only Knick who can get away with bossing his 
teammates around. And there is no doubt they could use a little internal 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Nets General Manager Harry Weltman recently stated that with power 
forwards Roy Hinson, Charles Shackelford, Jack Haley, Chris Dudley and Anthony 
Mason on the roster, the Nets have such a surplus that it puts them in good 
trading position in the off-season. That, of course, is assuming someone is 
interested in players who have had knee surgery, been involved in a 
point-shaving controversy and charged with marijuana possession, been waived, 
traded for second-round picks or who have played a total of 53 minutes this 
season.

WPP'S SORRELL A RELUCTANT KING OF AD WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Sorrell insists that he really doesn't want to wear the crown the 
advertising press keeps trying to place on his head: king of the ad world. 
</P>
<P>
Well, his British advertising holding company, WPP Group, was recently anointed 
the world's largest agency group by the American and British trade publications 
Advertising Age and Campaign. To achieve that title, it surpassed troubled 
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. by reporting 1989 gross income of $2.4 billion and 
billings of $16.05 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But Sorrell, in an interview before a speech to the American Assn. of 
Advertising Agencies in Palm Desert, said his goal is not to be a big shot of 
the ad world. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe a little shot, but not a big shot," said Sorrell, who never created an 
ad but who masterminded his company's purchases over the past two years of the 
giant American ad firms J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. "What I'd 
like to be is successful. If that's an indictment, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
Few can argue his successes. The 45-year-old executive is generally credited 
with vastly improving the performances of both Thompson and Ogilvy by ordering 
numerous cost-cutting measures. Profit margins at both agencies are now a 
respectable 10% or so, after falling as low as 4% at Thompson prior to his 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem Sorrell faces over the next few years is figuring out how to 
continue growing without upsetting clients or losing control of that growth, as 
some say rival Saatchi &amp; Saatchi appears to have done. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never stop growing," said Sorrell. "Our clients keep becoming larger 
in scope. So we have to be in a position to have our resources available to 
them as they expand." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike what he calls the "quantitative" growth at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, 
where Sorrell was formely director of finance, he says the growth at WPP has 
been "qualitative." 
</P>
<P>
Recent financial figures seem to bear that out. 
</P>
<P>
Last week WPP posted an 86% jump in pretax profits for 1989, compared to the 
year before. In comparison, the two brothers who founded Saatchi &amp; Saatchi 
agreed earlier this week to slash their annual $1-million salaries by 
one-third. They also revealed that the company's pretax profits plunged to 
$34.8 million in 1989, compared to $220 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrell denies taking any special pleasure in seeing his former bosses 
struggling. "Saatchi-bashing has become a big sport in the past few months. 
That's a little unfair. They've been in business for 20 years, and they've had 
one bad year, so suddenly everybody's jumping all over them." 
</P>
<P>
"All businesses have their difficulties," said Sorrell. "You can learn from 
your own mistakes better than you can learn from those made by others." 
</P>
<P>
So even if growth has spelled trouble for Saatchi, Sorrell insists that will 
not influence WPP's continued growth plans. "Nobody wants to work for a company 
that doesn't grow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sorrell isn't projecting any more bombshell announcements of agency 
purchases by WPP over the next year. "I don't think you'll be startled by 
anything we do," he said. In particular, he said, he wants to focus on 
"geographically expanding" WPP's strategic marketing services -- such as 
graphics and design -- in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Also, expansion of WPP into the entertainment industry is something Sorrell is 
considering. "A minority position in some TV station doesn't make bad sense," 
said Sorrell. "For the sake of our clients, it's important that we understand 
the dynamics of TV. But don't look for anything like WPP going Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Most Sorrell watchers, however, have learned to expect the unexpected from 
Sorrell. 
</P>
<P>
And some analysts point out that despite all of Sorrell's strategic purchases 
in recent years, WPP's stock is hardly the darling of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is to watch what he does and not what he says," said Alan Gottesman, 
an analyst at Paine Webber. "Martin is an incredible opportunist." 
</P>
<P>
Sorrell is also a realist: "When people come to me and tell me they have good 
news and they have bad news, I say, 'Forget about the good news, let's hear the 
bad news.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even those who don't approve of all of Sorrell's empire-building and 
cost-cutting tactics sometimes admit they admire the guy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a terrific competitor who has made some daring moves," said Alexander S. 
Kroll, chairman of Young &amp; Rubicam, one of the largest ad firms in America. 
"He makes many of us get out of bed a little earlier in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Sorrell also has vastly changed the lives of many executives at Thompson and 
Ogilvy. When Sorrell took over the agencies he eventually brought in new 
leaders who were told to close unprofitable branches, sell real estate and cut 
staff. He also ordered daily cash reports from the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Presumably, you like to know what's in your bank account," explained Sorrell. 
"That's what any responsible company does." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who work for Sorrell say his purchase of their agency was like a 
necessary slap in the face. "If Martin had never acquired Thompson, we could 
probably have kept plugging along in the same slow manner," said James K. 
Agnew, general manager of Thompson's Los Angeles office. "He was the catalyst 
for all the changes. It was like tossing a penny in a lake and watching the 
ripples. He tossed the penny that caused all the ripples." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't always just ripples that Sorrell leaves behind. Sometimes it's more 
like tidal waves. 
</P>
<P>
David Ogilvy, the 77-year-old founder of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, called Sorrell an 
"odious little jerk" when he first heard about Sorrell's bid to buy Ogilvy. But 
Ogilvy has since been named a director and non-executive chairman at WPP. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrell recalls later commenting to Ogilvy, "I can't believe an English 
gentleman would say anything of that nature." To that, Ogilvy, who played in a 
ball game with Sorrell last week in London, said: "You're absolutely right. 
What I said was worse."

MAJOR PENSION FUNDS PRESS EXXON FOR MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One observer is calling it "Larry &amp; Me." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl has already turned down one request for a 
meeting with New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, who manages five 
city pension plans that own Exxon stock, to discuss the company's environmental 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Holtzman and officials for California and Massachusetts pension funds -- 
both large institutional shareholders of Exxon -- will be sending Rawl a second 
letter seeking a meeting to discuss the company's actions since last year's oil 
spill in Alaska and more recent spills in the Arthur Kill waterway between New 
York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Rawl's elusiveness led a Holtzman colleague to allude to the popular 
documentary film, "Roger &amp; Me," in which General Motors Corp. Chairman 
Roger B. Smith dodged meetings with filmmaker Michael Moore, who wanted to ask 
him about the effect of GM's plant closures on Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The letter will go out as soon as Monday, signed by Holtzman, California 
Controller Gray Davis and Massachusetts pension fund Director Paul Quirk, Quirk 
confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our intent to do anything more than to try to sort this out," Quirk 
said Thursday. He said the pension officials were seeking "a way of dealing 
with the concerns we have as shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns include losses that Exxon will incur from the spills. Total 
costs for the Alaska spill are now in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, 
and the company could face future liability from civil suits and a federal 
criminal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Holtzman, who is the custodian and asset manager of five New York City pension 
systems that own more than 6 million Exxon common shares, declined to comment 
on the new letter to Rawl. But, she said, "We're very concerned with the 
apparently careless, negligent attitude with regard to the environment that 
could negatively affect the value of our shares." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Exxon's stock, trading at around $44.50 per share at the time of 
the Exxon Valdez accident and closing at $46.875 Thursday, has not kept pace 
with other oil industry stocks, which have appreciated as much as 30% to 40% 
over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Smith, a spokesman for Exxon, said he was not aware of any efforts to 
reach Rawl and could not comment on the requests Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Jan. 12, Holtzman asked to meet with Rawl and Exxon officials 
to discuss the company's progress in improving environmental safety. She posed 
a number of pointed questions about the spills in Arthur Kill from a pipeline 
to Exxon's Bayway Refinery, and requested detailed information about costs 
related to litigation resulting from the various spills. 
</P>
<P>
In a response dated Jan. 16, Exxon President Lee R. Raymond said it was 
"premature" to meet with Holtzman, but he attempted to answer a number of her 
questions. "We are dedicated to your interests in protecting the environment in 
areas where we operate and, at the same time, providing superior financial 
returns to our shareholders," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "Until our factual investigation (into the Arthur Kill spill) is 
completed, it would be premature to contemplate a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Davis, who is a trustee of the California Public Employees' 
Retirement System, called on Rawl to resign, blaming him for what he called 
Exxon's lack of interest in environmental safety. Davis said he was speaking 
for himself, not for CalPERS, which owns 8.24 million Exxon shares. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were interested in environmental safety, it would be a reality," he 
said in an interview Wednesday. "Clearly, the CEO is not interested, and I 
think he should resign in shame." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who is up for reelection as controller, has been mentioned as a possible 
Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1992.

Apple Computer Expects Improved Results: The Cupertino-based firm said results 
for its second fiscal quarter, which will end March 30, will be better than 
previously expected due to higher-than-expected revenue and gross margins and 
close management of expenses. In the year-ago second quarter, Apple earned 44 
cents a share on sales of $1.247 billion. Investors have been closely watching 
Apple for signs that it may reverse a recent slump in sales and profit growth.

NBC SUES SONY/COLUMBIA IN VIDEO 'PLOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual lawsuit between two entertainment giants, National Broadcasting 
Co. charges that Sony Corp. and its Columbia Pictures Entertainment unit have 
secretly undermined an 8-year-old home video distribution venture. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, NBC claims that 
Sony/Columbia has been hampering RCA/Columbia Home Video, a 50-50 joint venture 
set up by NBC and Columbia in 1982. The network claims that Sony/Columbia, by 
negotiating for home video rights behind the network's back, wants to set up 
its own home video distribution company to the detriment of the joint venture. 
The joint venture has two years remaining before it expires, and it holds the 
rights to over 500 titles beyond mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, NBC points to a deal struck last month in which Columbia will 
distribute Orion Pictures' next 50 films overseas in both theatrical and 
home-video markets. Columbia advanced Orion $175 million for the rights. 
</P>
<P>
NBC claims Columbia balked at the Orion package when it was first presented to 
the joint venture. Three previous agreements to distribute Orion titles have 
been highly profitable for the joint venture, NBC said, but Columbia management 
blocked approval of a fourth package because it was secretly trying to funnel 
the Orion films into its own future home-video operation. 
</P>
<P>
According to NBC's suit, the value of the joint venture is being hurt by 
Columbia's actions and by perceptions that the home video company will be 
"winding down" as the expiration date approaches. The network claims damages of 
at least $250 million and says the actual cost could be more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also describes a deteriorating and increasingly mistrustful 
relationship between the partners, including NBC preventing joint venture 
employees from traveling to London for a meeting with Columbia and Sony 
representatives to discuss the venture's operations. The network says Sony and 
Columbia officials tried to misappropriate confidential financial information 
from joint venture employees. 
</P>
<P>
A Sony spokesman declined comment and said the company has not yet seen the 
lawsuit. But the company issued a statement that "the lawsuit is surprising 
because Columbia and NBC have enjoyed a good relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Just how good is abundantly clear from disclosures made in the lawsuit. NBC 
says that the joint venture generated profits of more than $74 million in 1989 
on worldwide revenues of $470 million. The joint venture was described as 
having 400 employees and a payroll of $20 million. NBC estimates the "overall 
value" of the company to be more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Adams, a home-video analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel-based 
media investment firm, said the joint venture is ranked seventh among home 
video companies, behind all the majors with the exception of Orion. He 
estimated that domestic revenue has been flat over the past two years because 
the joint venture, with the exception of "Ghostbusters II," has not released 
any blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sony and Columbia representatives denied that the companies have ever 
stated they intend to launch a new home video arm, as NBC alleges in its 
lawsuit, Adams nonetheless says "that's always been the speculation, and 
privately I've heard that."

BRADY PROPOSES REMOVING SOME POWER FROM CFTC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Thursday proposed ending a bitter 
two-year turf battle over regulating a new breed of equities products by 
stripping the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of some or all of its power. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important is that we get something done and get it done now," said 
Brady in a speech before the National Newspaper Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His comments added sudden urgency to an issue that until now the Bush 
Administration has handled with great delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
Brady's outspokenness will likely propel legislation, viewed as wishful 
thinking several weeks ago, to hand the Securities and Exchange Commission 
control of all financial instruments based on stocks, congressional aides said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear the CFTC does not have the political support (that) people once 
thought it had," said one Senate staffer. 
</P>
<P>
The CFTC claims jurisdiction over any instruments that are like futures 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
A federal court in Chicago has given control of new stock index baskets to the 
CFTC. The baskets resemble both stocks and futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The CFTC already controls all futures contracts linked to stocks, which means 
the SEC has no authority over financial instruments that can cause wild swings 
in the stock markets it regulates. 
</P>
<P>
Such market volatility increasingly worries politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Brady outlined three options: merge the CFTC and SEC into a new 
super-regulatory agency, shift all financial instruments to the SEC -- leaving 
the CFTC tangible commodities -- or hand only stock-index products to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Brady stopped short of endorsing any one proposal. 
</P>
<P>
That is the role of a working group, composed of the Federal Reserve Board, 
Treasury Department, SEC and CFTC, studying the issue. But he stressed that the 
United States can no longer afford debilitating turf battles. 
</P>
<P>
"Fights between the SEC and CFTC for jurisdiction over newly invented 
instruments stand in the way of innovation, the lifeblood of our markets' 
competitiveness," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Removing barriers to U.S. competitiveness in today's global marketplace is a 
favorite theme of the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Congress was waiting for the presidential working group to forge a solution 
between the warring agencies. But events now are running ahead of that 
strategy.

DEAL NEAR TO PUT CARL'S JR. IN NINE PACIFIC NATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises, parent company of Carl's Jr., is negotiating a 
licensing agreement with a Malaysian finance company to expand the fast-food 
restaurant chain into nine Pacific Rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which could be announced as early as today, would mark the company's 
second major foray into the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Karcher signed a deal with a Japanese firm to develop 30 Carl's Jr. 
restaurants in Japan. Two are open and three more are slated to open this year. 
</P>
<P>
The move also places Karcher among the major U.S. fast-food operators staking a 
claim to the growing international market. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher is negotiating the new Far East licensing agreement with MBf 
International Ltd., a unit of MBF Group of Cos., a major financial services 
firm in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed agreement, the first Carl's Jr. restaurant would open in 
Malaysia early next year, followed by other outlets in Singapore, Australia and 
Hong Kong. Other target countries would include Indonesia, the Philippines, 
Thailand, Taiwan and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The financial terms of the deal could not be determined. But analysts said it 
would likely involve formation of a joint venture in which MBf would provide 
most of the financing and Karcher the management and training. MBf already has 
a licensing agreement with another U.S. restaurant chain, Dallas-based 
Grandy's. 
</P>
<P>
"A joint venture is the only way to go," said Sarah Stack, an analyst for 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. "You need to have a national partner to help 
navigate the cultural differences." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Karcher nor MBf officials could be reached for comment Thursday. But 
the basic outline of the transaction was confirmed by company representatives.

OVERSIZE JEWELRY IS A BIG HIT WITH DESIGNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This spring, the big news in jewelry is, well, big. The bigger the better. 
Paris designers Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent, and New Yorkers Oscar de 
La Renta and Isaac Mizrahi, were among those who showed how to handle the 
oversize effect when they accessorized spring suits or coat and dress ensembles 
with weighty examples of bright, bold gold. 
</P>
<P>
Wide cuff bracelets are worn in matched or unmatched pairs. Lapel brooches 
expand to 4 inches across, earrings brush the shoulder or sit on the lobe like 
massive shields, belt buckles can increase body weight by five pounds. 
</P>
<P>
This look will not pass with summer. Big bold gold pieces were seen in the 
Milan fall collections and in some of the Paris shows this week. 
</P>
<P>
All of it is obviously costume jewelry and seems to echo Coco Chanel, an early 
champion of fabulous fakes. Most of it harks back to ancient cultures when 
real, 24-karat gold was pounded, molded and cast into impressive symbols of 
wealth, beauty and mystical power. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the 'I spent a bundle' look without actually doing so," says Los Angeles 
jewelry sales representative Kathleen Matson. "Women collect jewelry; it gives 
them a lift. I think this new bolder, bigger jewelry means they want a big 
lift." BARBARA FOLEY

WOMEN'S BUSINESS ATTIRE CURVES AROUND THOSE OLD BOXY STYLES

Poor John T. Molloy. His "Woman's Dress for Success Book" has gone the way of 
pouf dresses. 
</P>
<P>
When he tackled the subject of business attire 12 years ago, he had no idea 
what strides women would make in the work force. Today, the Molloy monster -- a 
uniform with boxy jacket and blouse with floppy bow tie -- has all but bitten 
the dust. 
</P>
<P>
Women's ideas of what office attire should look like are shaped by media and 
fashion stars such as anchorwoman Diane Sawyer, actress Candice Bergen of the 
TV sitcom "Murphy Brown," and the working woman's champion designer, Donna 
Karan. They all look brainy, accomplished and undeniably feminine, but not 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
For L.A.'s desk set, there are only three cardinal sins: too tight, too short 
or donning denim.

Dingy sneakers with office clothes are a thing of the past -- those who can't 
handle heels are wearing classic, flat leather shoes. And though color is 
perfectly acceptable, the choices most business women make are far from madcap. 
They stick to the classics -- practical navy, pale gray, bright red, Kelly 
green, pale yellow and, primarily, black. The newest omnipresent neutral is a 
sophisticated olive drab that has nothing to do with safari styles. It's the 
type of gray-green seen lately on Armani's runway in Milan or in a man's 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
Women have borrowed other elements of the male executive's look -- quality 
fabrics, minimal detailing, neat haircuts and a minimum of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
But as one woman notes, borrowing and imitating are two different things. 
</P>
<P>
"Women don't feel that they have to conform. They don't have to look like a 
man," says Maxine Miller, a former attorney who is now a real estate developer. 
"A lot of how you dress tells your status, but it is all right now to look 
feminine." 
</P>
<P>
Based on observations of the Downtown lunch crowds, the most popular looks are: 
</P>
<P>
* The streamlined double-breasted coat dress with several strands of pearls 
(not, however, the piled-on Chanel-imitation multistrand mess). 
</P>
<P>
* The neat and shapely black suit in which the jacket is either single-breasted 
and collarless or double-breasted with gold buttons, and the skirt is always 
"business length," or just above the knee. 
</P>
<P>
* The loose navy suit, usually composed of a long, fluid pleated skirt and 
crisp tailored jacket. 
</P>
<P>
* The unmatched suit, such as a quiet glen plaid jacket and a solid skirt, or a 
slightly oversized navy blazer over neat tailored pants or a narrow skirt. 
</P>
<P>
* The slim, but not tight, tailored dress.

PORIZKOVA'S EYES. CHER'S CHEEKBONES. BASINGER'S LIPS.; 
</P>
<P>
A SURGICAL SEARCH FOR THE IDEAL FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

contributes to The Times' fashion pages.

<TEXT>
<P>
Paulina Porizkova's eyes. Jaclyn Smith's nose. Cher's cheekbones. Kim 
Basinger's lips. Put 'em together and you've got the ideal face. At least, the 
latest version. The physical features of these famous faces are on the current 
list of perfection among many women who want to change their own natural 
features through plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
As few as 10 years ago, the list was entirely different. In 1980, the nose of 
note was slim and straight, inspired by one actress Candice Bergen was born 
with. Ten years before that, it was upturned with a pinched tip, based on that 
of super-model Cheryl Tiegs. Like fads in clothing, hair styles and makeup, 
trends in cosmetic surgery change regularly, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
Of today's most desirable facial details, prominent cheekbones and pouty lips 
top the list. In contrast, Porizkova's large, slightly hooded eyes and Smith's 
narrow nose are considered classics that never really go out of style, experts 
note. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors also say that the prized facial proportions are relatively easy to 
attain through cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
High set, well-defined cheekbones, for example, are achieved with soft plastic 
implants inserted through incisions made inside the mouth or under the lower 
eyelid. The procedure costs about $1,800 in Southern California and takes less 
than an hour. Cheekbone, or malar, implants can be removed, but the surgery is 
generally thought of as a permanent procedure. Take out the implants and the 
face returns to its original form. 
</P>
<P>
Requests for surgically inserted "cheekbones" started rolling in during the 
mid-'80s, when Cher's film career took off and her highly articulated bone 
structure captured audience attention. Apple-cheeked actress Linda Evans of 
"Dynasty" had a similarly inspiring effect when her night-time soap was 
must-viewing during most of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years earlier, members of the American Society of Plastic and 
Reconstructive Surgeons reported virtually no cheek- or lip-augmentation 
procedures. But in 1988, when the society last surveyed its doctors, more than 
3,000 cheekbone augmentations had been reported. Although no figures are yet 
available, many doctors indicate that requests for cheekbone implants have 
doubled in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Augmenting the mouth is a temporary procedure done by injecting liquid collagen 
or human fat cells into the lips. The 15-minute treatment, which costs about 
$500, lasts about three months, or until the natural substances are absorbed by 
the body and the mouth returns to its normal contours. 
</P>
<P>
Many doctors say they discourage permanent silicone injections into the lips, 
in part because they see it as a fad that will soon become dated. In 1988, 
society surgeons were not reporting significant numbers of lip augmentations. 
But last year, when actress Barbara Hershey appeared in the film "Beaches" with 
seductive, Basinger-esque lips -- a mouth considerably fuller than in any of 
her previous films -- the trend was born. 
</P>
<P>
"It's especially popular with women under age 30: They want to look like 
fashion models," says Dr. John Williams, a clinical instructor at the UCLA 
School of Medicine and a plastic surgeon in private practice for 25 years. 
Williams is one of the doctors who predicts that the full lip look will soon be 
outdated. "That's when many of the women who had injections will be glad it was 
temporary," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Although women are requesting augmented cheekbones, their goal is not to 
achieve the gaunt, hollow-cheeked effect that was in demand 10 years ago. "In 
those days, some women had their back teeth removed to create the sunken cheek 
look," says Dr. Alfred Cohen, a facial plastic surgeon and partner in Beverly 
Hills' Lasky Clinic. "Now they want fuller cheeks and stronger angles." 
</P>
<P>
For some women, fuller cheeks means fat or collagen injections directly into 
the cheek area; for others, small pouches of silicone gel are placed under the 
cheekbones to create a youthful fullness. "The young girls -- the 20- to 
30-year-olds -- still come in for hollow cheeks, but the 40- to 50-year-olds 
want more fullness so they don't look haggard as they age," says Encino's Dr. 
Walter Dishell, an assistant clinical professor of facial plastic surgery at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The current most desirable chin, says Los Angeles plastic surgeon George Semel, 
projects slightly short of the tip of the nose -- as seen in Jaclyn Smith's 
facial proportions. The chin line should be firm, with the jawline clearly 
defined. In many cases an implant can achieve this look -- at an average cost 
of $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
To get rid of any signs of a double chin that may exist, the leading method is 
now liposuction, a fat suctioning technique introduced in 1981 that is used to 
slim body contours. "We can actually use liposuction to sculpt a jawline and 
neck, because instruments today are so refined," says Semel. 
</P>
<P>
In part, the trend toward implants and other augmentations, rather than 
removals, is a result of new technical advances in the field of plastic 
surgery, explains Dr. Richard Fleming, co-chairman of facial plastic and 
reconstructive surgery department at the USC School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s will definitely be the decade of augmentation," he says. "For years 
we found ways to tighten skin over the existing bony structure, and we were 
limited by what nature put there. Now we can use implants to change that 
underlying structure." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Varner, president of Santa Barbara-based McGhan Medical, which supplies 
silicone implants to surgeons, says the trendy augmentation procedures "have 
increased sales of implants tenfold in the last five years." 
</P>
<P>
Although most augmentations are done with standard implants, many doctors are 
now ordering customized designs, shaped precisely to fit the patient and to 
achieve the desired look. Varner reports that customized implants are available 
for the cheekbones, forehead, nose, chin and jaw line. 
</P>
<P>
Ethical surgeons are quick to warn patients that despite new technological 
developments, results are still limited by nature's original design. "When they 
bring in pictures of Paulina or Jaclyn Smith, I'm frank," says Dishell. "I tell 
them they've brought in pictures of two of the most beautiful women in the 
world, and that I can only work with what they've got to begin with. That 
sobers them. I call it the 'doctrine of realistic expectations.' "

THE LEAGUE TURNS 70: WHERE TO NOW?; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS FACES DWINDLING FUNDS AND DECLINING 
MEMBERSHIP. BUT THE PUBLIC STILL HOLDS THE STAUNCHLY NONPARTISAN GROUP IN HIGH 
ESTEEM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In February, 1920, with ratification of the 19th Amendment just months away, 
suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt founded the League of Women Voters of the United 
States. Faced with a newly enfranchised group of 20 million women who had been 
told it was unladylike to vote, the national nonpartisan league dedicated 
itself to eradicating that notion and educating women about the issues and 
their new responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy years later, with membership and funds declining, the league is still 
working hard to get out the vote, influence government policy and promote 
participation in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
But in an age of glitz, celebrity, short attention spans and sound-bite 
campaigning, the league is seldom in the limelight. Its loyal members seem to 
see themselves, by choice, as a backstage organization out to preserve the 
democratic process. They know the league has a visibility problem, that it has 
a reputation for doing drudge work, that it is described in rather unglamorous 
terms: solid, stalwart, dedicated, naive, boring. 
</P>
<P>
Can such an organization expect to be around for its 80th birthday in the year 
2000? 
</P>
<P>
This year, members of the Los Angeles League, which was also founded in 1920, 
will be celebrating and soul-searching. There is an anniversary brunch this 
weekend, a fund-raiser in the fall and, shortly, a letter that league president 
Lois Saffian will be sending to past presidents, asking, "Where do we go from 
here?" 
</P>
<P>
"We're facing a challenge right now as a volunteer organization," Saffian said 
recently at the league's offices in the Mid-Wilshire area. "How are we going to 
continue the program we're known for with diminishing resources? . . . We have 
an important purpose that is never going to go away. What can we do to live up 
to that purpose?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Paula Menkin, a member of the Los Angeles unit since 1946 and president 
from 1953 to 1955: "There's nobody else who does these things. To me, the fact 
it's not glamorous does not mean it's not exciting. It is exciting. I've now 
spent close to 50 years being excited by the issues. . . . Who else sits at 
city council meetings and watchdogs things for citizens? Nobody else would 
study the state Constitution, the city and county charters. These are the nuts 
and bolts of government." 
</P>
<P>
But hard work alone will not ensure its future. 
</P>
<P>
"I am both confident and worried," Saffian said. "The need is always there. By 
definition, democracy means government open to change by people, but people 
have got to know how to do it. People who want to keep (democracy) going 
gravitate toward the league." 
</P>
<P>
The national and local organizations have always been strapped for money, 
Saffian said, and nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not terribly sophisticated in raising money," she said. "We're so 
focused on accomplishments and issues, we've had a hard time to get members to 
support us. They'll say, 'We're not here to raise money.' " 
</P>
<P>
The diminishing resources that most concern Saffian are people -- the men and 
women who do the work (the league has admitted men since 1974). Los Angeles 
membership is 940, down from about 1,200 when Saffian took over the presidency 
three years ago. (At its peak, membership was about 1,600.) 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, some observers say that the league has never been so powerful. 
One political consultant, Steven M. Glazer, said that invariably public opinion 
polls give the league one of the highest credibility ratings of any 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, they're being catered to by Republicans and Democrats," Glazer 
said of the league, which, for example, this year is backing ballot measures 
supporting a largely Republican-backed reapportionment initiative, bipartisan 
state and local ethics reform measures and a transportation ballot measure led 
by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"That is enormous clout to have. I don't even think they recognize the extent 
of it, but it's recognized by other insiders. They have this white hat image. 
They seem like these little mice at times, but they're the mice that roar." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, league members have been educated, middle-class homemakers who 
joined in an era when they were expected not to work for money. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Lane, a fire commissioner for the city for the past 13 years, joined the 
league in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
"We had children, and we had to get out of the house to talk of something other 
than diapers," she said. "It was intellectually stimulating, and there were not 
a lot of other opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Members did and still do put in vast amounts of time studying issues, analyzing 
materials, monitoring governmental meetings, writing reports, helping to draft 
legislation, lobbying and speaking to groups on various issues. 
</P>
<P>
The organization is frequently described as a leadership training ground for 
future public life, and the Los Angeles league is proud of members like former 
City Council President Pat Russell and Councilwoman Joy Picus. The league is 
"the single most important influence in my life that made me go into public 
life," Picus said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a career," Lane said. "I put in about 25 hours a week." 
</P>
<P>
But few women are willing or able to do that kind of work any more. They are 
working full-time or are unwilling to perform such skilled labor for no pay -- 
or they prefer single-issue causes because the results are more tangible and 
the process quicker. 
</P>
<P>
The league has always prided itself on being a multi-issue organization. In the 
early years league members nationwide supported collective bargaining, child 
labor laws, minimum wage legislation, and federal aid for maternal and child 
care programs. They fought the spoils system and promoted the merit system in 
government employment, backed Social Security, and discouraged isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s the league has been at the forefront of many environmental 
issues. League members worked for civil rights, especially through voter 
registration, and, in Los Angeles, supported school desegregation and busing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the league supports the equal rights amendment and takes a 
pro-choice position in the abortion debate. 
</P>
<P>
But voting and governmental processes have been a primary focus, and last year 
the national league decided to scale down, declaring it could no longer be all 
things to all people. Its priorities are public campaign financing and voter 
registration and turnout. The league has worked for passage of the national 
voter registration act, commonly called the "motor voter" act, which includes 
provisions enabling people to register when they get their driver's licenses. 
It passed the House in February. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles League appears to be headed in a similar direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Locally, we're very proud of our effort to get high school students 
registered," Saffian said of their on-campus efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Said lawyer Geoff Cowan, chairman of the city's ethics code commission: "I 
think they're needed now more than ever. They do the most thorough job in 
analyzing things. The support of the league on the city ethics (and campaign 
finance) ballot measure is so important. People tend to say, 'If the league 
supports it, it must be OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
That is a frequently heard description of the league and one that may become 
controversial in California in the coming months. The state league has endorsed 
-- and helped write -- Proposition 119, a reapportionment measure that would 
redraw state legislative districts, sponsored by San Mateo County Supervisor 
Tom Huening, who is a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the state takes a position (that) local can't support," Saffian said 
in reference to the measure. "We're taking a no-action position. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a rubber-stamp organization . . . but it's important that we have 
the discipline not to undermine (the state league)." 
</P>
<P>
Selma Calnan, a member of the East San Gabriel Valley League, was one of five 
statewide members who co-wrote the reapportionment study the league undertook 
in 1987. But she opposes the state league's position and said of the 
restriction on opposition from a local unit, such as Los Angeles, "It's 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Although Calnan said she is indebted to the league, she nonetheless has some 
harsh criticisms of the organization and said the reapportionment issue points 
up a fundamental weakness that goes back to its founding. 
</P>
<P>
"Here they were, all innocent, feeling so righteous," she said of suffragists 
in 1920. "They dove into partisan politics and got skunked. They retreated into 
the hills, and remained above it all. And that's where they are today, above 
the partisan battle. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a fastidious dislike for partisan politics and a great sense of 
certitude about their rightness. I'm probably that way, too, I guess. But they 
confirm their prejudices by only talking to each other." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she said, the league is strong in its knowledge of governmental 
process but weak on political savvy. That lack of savvy, she said, led the 
state league in the late 1960s to support deinstitutionalizing the mentally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so naive. We thought the local governments would pick up the tab" and 
fund local programs for those released. "I feel personally ashamed of that." 
</P>
<P>
Hearing Calnan's charges of naivete regarding reapportionment, Joy Picus said: 
"In a sense, much of what she says is true. The league is naive. But that's 
important to their image. 
</P>
<P>
"I commend the L.A. League for standing apart. It shows remarkable perception 
not to be part of that. It's significant that the major league in the state has 
done so." 
</P>
<P>
Where, then, is the nonpartisan league's strength? 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I think it's a lot of wasted effort," said political consultant Joe 
Cerrell, of Los Angeles-based Cerrell Associates Inc. Stressing he was more 
aware of league activities on a national level, he said it might be more 
effective locally. 
</P>
<P>
"But nationally they're a nice neuter group. I think they mean well, but their 
laundry list of accomplishments -- I don't think it's a very long list. They do 
the presidential debates. Whoopee." 
</P>
<P>
The league, often a sponsor of local and primary debates, began sponsoring 
presidential debates in 1976, but in a struggle for control with the political 
parties in the 1988 election campaign, withdrew altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a partisan world relative to state and national government," 
Cerrell said. "I would like to harness all that energy into getting good people 
elected to office." 
</P>
<P>
Saffian took Cerrell's criticisms to heart. "It's really difficult to say where 
the league has been effective. It's immeasurable, except where the league has 
taken the leadership, like the motor voter act." 
</P>
<P>
Cerrell's criticism, she said, may relate to "our need to publicize ourselves 
in a more sophisticated way. Maybe we've been like the nuns, thinking God will 
take care of us because we're so good and righteous. We need a good marketing 
plan. You wouldn't start a business without one today. We never did that." 
(Saffian said a public relations agency has agreed to take the L.A. League on 
as a pro bono client and will design a public relations campaign for the 
organization.) 
</P>
<P>
If it is still around, what will the League look like in 2000? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we're all around in the year 2000," Saffian said, mentioning the 
precarious state of the human race and the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the massive changes in so much of the world, she said the United 
States, in a crisis on so many fronts -- education, the environment, 
homelessness, the national debt -- probably will go through some major changes 
too, although not through a classic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be playing its historic role, but in a probably different 
political environment. I hope that doesn't sound too radical," she said. "I 
have to believe it's not all a waste of time. And if enough of us felt that 
way. . . ."

KADAFI THREATENS BONN ON PLANT FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
LIBYA: THE STRONGMAN SAYS HE WILL RETALIATE IF WEST GERMANY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
DAMAGE TO THE SUSPECTED POISON GAS FACILITY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi threatened Thursday to retaliate against West 
Germany if that country helped to instigate a fire at a controversial chemical 
plant near Tripoli, but he angrily denied that Libya had been producing 
chemical weapons at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kadafi stopped short of directly accusing West Germany of a role in 
the crippling fire, hundreds of Libyan demonstrators massed outside the West 
German Embassy in Tripoli on Thursday, declaring that West German intelligence 
agents were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether the plant turned out chemical weapons, Kadafi repeated his 
country's denials. 
</P>
<P>
"If Libya could manufacture them, it would not have hesitated," he said in a 
statement broadcast by Tripoli Radio. "However, Libya on its own and by its own 
efforts needs another 20 years to produce a chemical bomb." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to offer a multimillion-dollar contract "to anyone who could build a 
chemical factory for Libya." 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi pointedly did not mention the extent of the damage from the Wednesday 
morning industrial fire at the plant near Rabta, about 60 miles southwest of 
Tripoli, where U.S. officials believe Libya has produced deadly mustard gas and 
nerve gas since last year. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Arab authorities said there are indications that the plant, which 
Libya insists is used only to manufacture pharmaceuticals, was heavily damaged 
by fire, and Libya's official news agency Jana reported, "Most of the factory 
has been destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the agency had accused Israel and the United States of sabotaging 
the plant, but Kadafi's subsequent statement targeted only West Germany. After 
more than 1,000 Libyan demonstrators marched outside the West German Embassy, a 
diplomatic source in Tripoli said the Libyans accused West German intelligence 
agents of leaking details about the plant's design to the United States, 
implying that U.S. agents could then have sabotaged the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"If the investigation under way confirms the involvement of West German 
intelligence in an action inside Libya, the economic presence of Germany will 
be eliminated from Libya," Kadafi warned. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators outside the embassy carried signs proclaiming "Germans Are Spies 
and Liars," "Germans Out" and "Germany Down, Kadafi's Our Leader," prompting 
the Foreign Ministry in Bonn to summon a Libyan diplomat and complain about 
harassment of West German diplomats. Bonn's embassy in Tripoli delivered a 
response denying any complicity in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The accusation lacks reality, and . . . any suggestion that any German citizen 
or West German intelligence was involved (is) pure invention," a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States have also denied any involvement. U.S. officials 
acknowledged that Israel has both the capability and the motive to destroy the 
plant but said they had no information to link Israel to the incident. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they have received credible reports that Libyan authorities 
arrested several suspects Wednesday on suspicion of involvement in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has made no secret of its opposition to the chemical plant, 
and one U.S. official responded privately Thursday to news of the fire with the 
happy observation that "the 'Force' is with us." 
</P>
<P>
Official Washington reaction, however, was much more neutral. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the origins of the fire," White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater told reporters in Washington. "We don't know if it was sabotage. We 
don't have any idea who did it. . . . Somebody could have knocked over a 
kerosene lamp or something." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "a lot of people" in the intelligence agencies believe that the fire 
was caused by an industrial accident, said one Administration official privy to 
intelligence reports on the issue. "They have had at least two" accidents in 
the past, the official noted, adding that "it would be consistent with the 
pattern." 
</P>
<P>
One of the accidents, two years ago, led to the release of gas and the killing 
of a large number of dogs in the vicinity of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
When that accident occurred, workers at the plant made frantic telephone calls 
to the firm in West Germany that helped in the construction. The calls were 
intercepted by U.S. agents and were a prime source of U.S. information that the 
plant was, in fact, producing gas and that the West German company had been 
involved. The firm, Imhausen-Chemie, is under investigation by the Bonn 
government over the affair. 
</P>
<P>
The official cautioned, however, that the accident theory on the fire was not a 
"consensus view" and that some analysts continue to believe that the plant was 
sabotaged. 
</P>
<P>
American officials based their damage estimates on satellite photographs of the 
plant. Fitzwater said that damage to the plant appeared to be so serious that 
the facility is not able to function. "Common sense would tell you it's not 
functioning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Egyptian intelligence official said Thursday: "What we know is there 
is big damage." 
</P>
<P>
But Arab authorities have been unable to secure reliable information about the 
extent of the damage or whether anyone was injured, the Egyptian official said. 
"It's impossible," he said. " . . . It's in the desert; nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
The British news service Reuters quoted unidentified Libyan officials as saying 
two people were killed in the fire, but the Libyan news agency said later that 
there were no casualties. U.S. officials said they had no firm information on 
civilian casualties around the plant, but they noted that fire would not be 
expected to spread poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
"Mustard and nerve chemical agents are highly flammable and easily destroyed by 
fire," said a Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Robin Higgins. "The hotter the fire, the 
faster the agents would be destroyed. Chemical contamination seems highly 
unlikely, since the best way of getting rid of mustard gas is by burning." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Tripoli and elsewhere in the region said a variety of rumors were 
circulating, including reports that a commando team had crossed the border into 
Libya from Tunisia. But none ruled out the possibility of an industrial 
accident. In Cairo, an anonymous caller claiming to represent the previously 
unknown National Wing of the Libyan Army, perhaps a Libyan dissident group, 
claimed in a call to a West German television office to have started the fire 
"after making sure the plant was making chemical and nuclear material." 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's semiofficial Middle East News Agency carried a statement from the 
Cairo-based Egyptian Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity condemning what the 
group termed an apparent act of sabotage "aimed at distracting world attention 
away from the chemical and nuclear weapon arsenals that Israel possesses." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not exclude the involvement of the United States and Israel in this 
sabotage, particularly as President Bush had threatened to launch a military 
action against the plant," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials last week refused to rule out use of military force against the 
Libyan plant, which Fitzwater described as "dangerous and becoming more so." 
West Germany charged in a statement last week that Libya had produced 30 tons 
of mustard gas in a test run at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
But Kadafi said Thursday that Libya has signed agreements banning the 
proliferation of "weapons of total destruction and their use" and that Libya 
would be entitled to build such a facility under international law. 
</P>
<P>
"I challenge any company or state to come to Libya to build a chemical 
factory," he said. "Then I would personally sign the contract without 
hesitation, and I would have paid 1 billion to anyone who could build a 
chemical factory for Libya, because the world has not yet forbidden that." In 
Kadafi's offer of money, it was unclear what currency he referred to. 
</P>
<P>
International law prohibits the use of chemical weapons but not their 
manufacture or stockpiling. The United States and Soviet Union both have 
sizable stockpiles of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Libya is a civilized and Muslim country which fears only God and respects 
international treaties and laws," he added. "There is nothing to be gained from 
being hostile to Libya. What is beneficial is to sit down and to negotiate with 
Libya." 
</P>
<P>
If Kadafi carries out his threat to eliminate West Germany's economic presence 
from his country, the loss would not be vital to the West Germans, whose 
interests there are confined to oil exploration on a relatively small scale and 
a limited involvement in contracting. East Germany, on the other hand, has long 
had close ties to the Kadafi regime, and its security forces have been deeply 
involved in providing him protection. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Libyan relations in recent years have been vitriolic, with Washington 
accusing Kadafi's regime of supporting international terrorism. American and 
Libyan warplanes have tangled over the Mediterranean on two occasions, with the 
loss of four Libyan planes. In April, 1986, responding to reports of Libyan 
involvement in the bombing of a West German discotheque that took the lives of 
two Americans, U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli and Benghazi, with 37 Libyans and 
two American airmen reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
One senior U.S. official said the apparent large-scale damage to the plant has 
"opened up a whole new set of options" for the American government in denying 
Libya the ability to produce chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. efforts in recent months have focused on rallying international 
support to deny Libya critical "precursor chemicals" and the missile technology 
to deliver chemical weapons, the fire could allow the United States to "start 
from the beginning" and try to prevent the Libyans from getting the material to 
rebuild its factory. 
</P>
<P>
But the official stressed that the incident was the result of a happy 
coincidence, not U.S. sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't life wonderful?" the jubilant official asked. "The 'Force' is with us. 
We're on a roll." 
</P>

ISRAELI REGIME FALLS ON VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government fell Thursday night on a tense 
parliamentary vote of no confidence as the rightist Likud Party leader doggedly 
refused to accept an American formula to start Israel's first peace talks with 
the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 60 against Shamir's government, 55 in favor of it and five key 
abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's defeat marked the first time in Israel's 41 years of independence a 
government had lost a no-confidence vote in the Knesset, Israel's Parliament. 
Under Israel law, Shamir will continue as head of a transitional government 
while President Chaim Herzog begins what promises to be a long process of 
establishing a new regime. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis began in late February when the Labor Party, then the Likud's 
coalition partner, demanded that Shamir accept a plan for peace talks put 
forward by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir refused Labor's demand, and the crisis came to a head on Tuesday when 
Shamir fired Peres. The 10 other Labor ministers promptly resigned from the 
Cabinet, and Labor submitted the motion of no confidence in the rump government 
left to Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, after nearly seven hours of debate on the motion, the 
outcome clearly pivoted on the votes of the six-man Shas party, an 
ultra-Orthodox group that circulated a compromise proposal requiring Shamir to 
accept the Baker proposal. The prime minister demanded a two-hour recess and 
went to the home of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual guide of the Shas deputies. 
Soon after, he was joined there by Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, 
the top Labor Party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Asked point-blank to approve the Baker plan and let Labor back into government 
in return for withdrawal of the no-confidence motion, Shamir refused, asking 
instead for more time for consultations. Peres and his party, flatly opposed to 
further delays, pressed for the critical vote. 
</P>
<P>
As Shamir returned to his seat in the Knesset, the voice vote began; the prime 
minister smiled grimly as five of the six Shas seats remained empty, signaling 
automatic abstentions. A 60-60 tie would have meant victory for Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue in our fight," Shamir told reporters immediately after the 
defeat. "Life goes on even after no-confidence votes." 
</P>
<P>
The fall of his government ended a day in which Peres and other Labor stalwarts 
again and again lashed the prime minister verbally for stalling. Peres, opening 
his remarks, declared: "We can have unity for the sake of peace, not unity for 
paralysis or evasions, not unity for murdering the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
In his own speech, Shamir gravely advised, "We are not afraid of peace or the 
peace process. We fear irresponsible concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the crisis, Shamir has attacked Baker's proposal that a Palestinian 
panel for preliminary talks in Cairo include a few deportees from the occupied 
territories as well as Palestinians residing in East Jerusalem. The former, he 
argued, would be tainted by influence from the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and the latter would raise questions about Israeli sovereignty 
over the eastern sector of Jerusalem, annexed after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's debate began about 11 a.m. when Peres introduced the Labor motion of 
no confidence, almost precisely two days after he had been sacked by Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, the deputy prime minister and finance minister in the now-shattered 
coalition, rose from the front bench of the Labor deputies, an unaccustomed 
location for a man who has sat for many years at the table reserved for 
government ministers. At his request, he was introduced by Speaker Dov 
Shilansky simply as Knesset member Shimon Peres. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely looking at his notes, Peres launched into a strident, sometimes angry 
attack on Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come to express no confidence in a man," he declared, looking at the 
impassive prime minister who sat scribbling on a tablet at the government 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Several times, shouts from the Likud benches interrupted Peres, who paused 
impatiently as Shilansky gaveled for quiet in the modernistic stone-walled 
Knesset chamber. The hall was packed for the showdown between the two party 
leaders whose political futures were on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Bearded deputies from the religious parties shuttled between the Labor and 
Likud benches, apparently discussing the last-minute compromise proposals 
designed to salvage the unity government. 
</P>
<P>
"I propose voting no confidence in the man who ended two processes, peace and 
national unity," Peres declaimed. 
</P>
<P>
"Who will believe you ever again in this country?" he continued, accusing 
Shamir of breaking up the coalition and failing to deliver on promises to the 
religious parties, who held the swing votes on the no-confidence motion. "You 
have broken every promise. 
</P>
<P>
"Shamir has one problem, fear," Peres declared "Fear to make peace with Egypt, 
fear to make peace with Jordan, fear to reach a dialogue with the 
Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
And, he asserted in a foreign policy revelation, Syria has notified Jerusalem 
that it wants to discuss negotiating demilitarization in the Golan Heights, the 
territory dividing Israel from its bitterest Arab enemy. 
</P>
<P>
In the test of strength that came after weeks of a mounting crisis in the 
brittle coalition, the 66-year-old longtime leader of the left-center Labor 
Party was unrelenting in his 40-minute personal attack on Shamir, six years his 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who took the podium after leftist party leaders aligned 
with Labor had their say, read from a prepared text, rarely raising his eyes or 
his gravelly voice until late in his speech. Heckling from the Labor deputies 
halted him again and again until, exasperated, he growled over the tumult: "If 
you keep screaming, I'm staying here until tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir traced the course of the peace plan based on Palestinian elections that 
he introduced 10 months ago, insisting that it had been damaged by lack of 
cooperation from Labor and what he characterized as inopportune comments by 
American officials. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past months and weeks, he has accused Labor of being soft on PLO 
influence on the proposed peace talks, demanding guarantees that Palestinian 
representatives be free from direct or indirect contacts with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
He accused his former coalition partners of "constant back-stabbing" -- and 
Peres personally of trying to dominate the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
"Peres never accepted the fact that he was not prime minister," Shamir charged, 
referring to the partnership that collapsed Tuesday. Peres headed an earlier 
Likud-Labor coalition from 1984 to 1986, trading stints at the top with Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
"We must determine our fate," Shamir demanded. "What we do here will affect the 
fate of the Jewish people throughout the world. The enemies are still at the 
gate. They are far from achieving their goals. The land is still being built 
and the way is still long to the settlement of all parts of her." 
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli political analysts, the compromise put forward by Shas was 
the deciding factor. Deputy Prime Minister David Levy, a Likud member, pointed 
out that his party had already rejected the Baker plan in Cabinet consultations 
before the coalition collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Yosef, the Shas leader, had emerged in recent months as a convert to a 
peaceful solution of Israel's long conflict with the Palestinians. He had 
argued that protection of human life took precedence over the disputed West 
Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Yosef has a strong following among Israelis of North African and Near Eastern 
descent, an important voting bloc for Likud. 
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, President Herzog will consult with party leaders and decide 
who has the best chance to form a new government. The inside track would seem 
to go to Peres -- Likud suffered another blow Thursday when five of its members 
formed a separate faction, reducing the official Likud count in Parliament from 
40 to 35, four less than Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog's choice would have up to six weeks to build a working majority. If the 
first choice fails, the president can try someone else. If no one can paste 
together a coalition, new elections would be called.

HIGH COURT OKS DRUG TESTS OF JOB APPLICANTS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: JUSTICES REJECT A CHALLENGE TO A COURT OF APPEAL RULING ON THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A MANDATORY URINALYSIS.

<P>
The state Supreme Court, acting for the first time on the controversy of 
drug-testing in the workplace, on Thursday allowed a private employer to 
require that job applicants take drug and alcohol tests. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a brief order issued without dissent, rejected a challenge to 
a precedent-setting ruling last November by a state Court of Appeal that found 
that mandatory urinalysis to detect drug use among job-seekers represented only 
a limited intrusion on the right to privacy -- and did not violate the state 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court upheld a pre-employment drug and alcohol screening program 
administered by Matthew Bender Co., a legal publishing firm owned by the Times 
Mirror Co., which also publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for three job applicants who challenged the tests called the 
across-the-board screening program "patently unreasonable," noting that neither 
public safety nor law-enforcement positions were involved. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court's denial of review means that for now, the appellate ruling 
will be binding on trial courts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions Thursday, the high court: 
</P>
<P>
* In a sharp setback to the insurance industry, refused to hear a challenge by 
auto insurers to Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie's denial of a 112% 
increase in assigned-risk insurance rates. An association of insurers that 
issues policies to more than 1 million motorists without regular coverage 
contended they were losing more than $2 million a day in assigned-risk 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
But the court also declined requests by Gillespie and the sponsors of 
Proposition 103 to assume immediate jurisdiction over more than a dozen 
lawsuits now in lower courts involving the 1988 insurance reform initiative. 
Attorneys for Gillespie and Voter Revolt argued that high court intervention 
could speed resolution of legal questions about the measure by at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
* Let stand a novel ruling by a state Court of Appeal that upheld the criminal 
conviction of a Hemet man for secretly videotaping his sexual encounters with 
three women in 1986. The appellate court found that sexual intercourse was a 
form of private "communication" and that covert taping without the other 
party's knowledge was a violation of state privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
The laws at issue apparently were aimed to prevent surreptitious telephone 
recording -- but the appeal court held they could apply to nonverbal acts as 
well. The defendant in the case, Michael Francis Gibbons, was fined $4,500 and 
sentenced to 14 months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The drug-testing case was one of three such disputes that have emerged recently 
in state appeal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, an appellate panel in San Francisco, upholding a $485,000 damage 
award to an employee who was fired after refusing a random test, held that 
workers in nonsafety-related jobs could not be forced to undergo urinalysis to 
determine drug use. An appeal court in Los Angeles ruled that a worker's 
refusal to submit to even a less intrusive eye test to detect drug use could 
not serve as grounds for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Rex S. Heinke of Los Angeles, an attorney for Matthew Bender, welcomed 
Thursday's action by the high court as a "clear signal" that private employers 
may test applicants, so long as steps are taken to minimize the intrusion on 
privacy. Heinke noted that the justices may have an opportunity to set further 
guidelines for testing if and when the two other drug-testing cases -- 
involving the broader question of tests for employees -- reach the high court. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the job applicants, Stephen L. Mayer of San Francisco, voiced 
disappointment with the action, saying any distinction between the privacy 
rights of applicants and employees was "extremely unfortunate." Mayer added, 
however, that some applicant testing -- if not performed with proper safeguards 
-- could still be found unconstitutional. "I see today's action as a cautionary 
light, rather than a green light, to employers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The court's action Thursday was a test of Californians' constitutional right to 
privacy, which was added to the state Constitution by the voters in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the courts have applied the amendment to curb violations of 
privacy by public officials -- such as undercover college classroom 
surveillances by police. But it remained unsettled whether privacy protections 
were applicable to employment practices by private companies. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bender case, the drug tests were initiated in 1985 as part of a program 
for all Times Mirror companies. At the Matthew Bender office in Oakland, three 
job applicants -- Kathleen Wilkinson, Rina Hirai and Francesca Bannerman -- 
refused to take the tests, as part of a medical examination, and were denied 
jobs. They brought suit, arguing that the tests violated their constitutional 
right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco said that the right to 
privacy does apply to private companies, but that urine testing of applicants 
presents only a limited intrusion on privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
The court noted that job applicants could easily anticipate being asked to take 
a pre-employment physical examination -- and that urinalysis was ordinarily a 
part of such exams. The company gave advance notice that a job was conditioned 
on consent to drug testing and steps were taken to minimize the intrusion on 
privacy -- for example, applicants are not observed while furnishing samples, 
the panel pointed out.

ON CALIFORNIA: THIS COULD BE ABORTION PILL'S BATTLEGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Initially, the scene looks like any other political boogie in a dull election 
year: Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, running for governor, stands up and says 
he wants the drug RU 486 tested in California. OK, John. RU 486 is the abortion 
pill and this move just might drain some of the female vote away from 
front-runner Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
As a maneuver, it has a weary quality. The manufacturer of RU 486, the French 
drug company Roussel Uclaf, hasn't even applied for a license to test its 
product and shows no signs of wanting to do so. On the face of it, RU 486 seems 
to be an issue so vaporous that its only utility lies in the realm of the 
purely political. 
</P>
<P>
But there is an axiom in politics known as the law of unintended consequences. 
If you've been driving the freeways in the last day and happened to spin the 
radio dial to the talk shows, you might have noticed this law in action. All 
you heard on the radio was RU 486. Except the call-in people weren't talking 
about Dianne or John or who won the boogie. They were talking about the drug. 
</P>
<P>
There's a reason for this. RU 486 is one of those rare drugs, like the birth 
control pill, that represents a great leap from the past and has the power to 
change the human condition. It would make surgical procedures obsolete for most 
abortions. It would mean the decision to terminate a pregnancy would be carried 
out at home, not a hospital or a clinic, and therefore would be cloaked in a 
privacy heretofore unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Those virtues also make the drug intensely political in the grandest sense. Put 
simply, RU 486 could cripple the movement to stop abortions. If clinics and 
hospitals no longer serve as the centers of abortions, who does the movement 
attack? Where do the true believers go to lay down their bodies? 
</P>
<P>
There is an easy answer to that question: they attack the drug company that 
sells RU 486. In fear of that response, Roussel Uclaf has declined any attempt 
to market the drug in this country. From a business standpoint, the risk of a 
company-wide boycott has outweighed the profit potential of a single drug. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, these calculations are tricky and subject to revision. What if 
Roussel Uclaf, or another company, could limit its risk by marketing RU 486 in 
one state only, rather than taking on the whole country? And what if that state 
is California, with a relatively low Catholic population and a liberal attitude 
toward new products that promise a better life? 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly the situation we have here. When Van de Kamp brought up RU 486, 
he was suggesting that we take advantage of California's unique position in 
drug testing. California alone operates a program where the state can approve 
drugs without the prior consent of the federal government. The single proviso 
is that such drugs be manufactured and sold within the state's borders. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from politics, the advantages of a test here are obvious. RU 486 carries 
the promise of lower risk during abortion because it does not involve an 
invasive procedure. It acts by blocking absorption of the hormone progesterone 
and may also be effective in use against breast cancer and endometriosis, one 
of the leading causes of infertility in women. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, before any of this comes about some drug company must be willing to 
take the risk. A year ago, or even six months ago, that prospect was regarded 
as non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
It still remains faint, but times are changing fast. In one of the great 
political ironies, the rollback of Roe vs. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court last 
year marked the revival of pro-choice sentiment. All three of our major 
gubernatorial candidates support the notion that a woman has the right to make 
the abortion decision for herself. And the very fact that Van de Kamp believes 
he can get some mileage out of an aggressive pro-choice stand is a measure of 
where he thinks the momentum lies. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, and maybe it's not so distant, that shift could become 
pronounced enough that one or another drug company will decide the profit 
potential is worth the risk. And then we might see a quiet application for 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
What then? It's probably safe to predict that California would become the nexus 
of a new phase in the abortion war. A struggle that involves technology and 
morality all at once, a Brave-New-World kind of struggle. 
</P>
<P>
After all, isn't that why God made California? So bring it on. This is a matter 
of destiny.

PRESSURE FROM KEATING CITED BY INVESTIGATORS;

<P>
LINCOLN: THE HOUSE BANKING PANEL CHAIRMAN MAKES PUBLIC A LETTER THAT HE SAYS 
SUGGESTS A 'FIX WAS IN AT THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK BOARD IN 1988.'

Congressional investigators Thursday disclosed what they said was evidence 
indicating that Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. and top 
federal regulators had privately agreed to a plan in 1988 that helped the 
troubled Irvine thrift avoid a government seizure for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said a letter 
written to Keating by one of his lawyers, Margery Waxman, on May 10, 1988, 
suggests that a "fix was in at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1988 to 
protect Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first evidence uncovered by the committee that appears to support 
Gonzalez's allegations that M. Danny Wall, then bank board chairman, was 
responding to personal pressure from Keating when he declined to take 
aggressive action against Lincoln prior to April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Wall, who recently resigned as chairman of the bank board's 
successor agency under pressure from Gonzalez, strongly denied there was any 
private agreement or that he had succumbed to pressure from Keating and his 
attorneys. Wall said he never met with Waxman in her capacity as Keating's 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's spokesman, Bradley J. Boland, said that Wall was simply agreeing to a 
just resolution of the government's lengthy investigation of Lincoln's 
financial affairs. "We weren't conspiring with Danny Wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision, the bank board's successor agency, issued a 
statement saying that the Waxman letter "is riddled with errors and false 
conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was not seized by the government until April 14, 1989, even though bank 
board regulators in San Francisco had recommended action against the Irvine 
thrift stemming from allegations of mismanagement as early as 1987. The San 
Francisco regulators subsequently were stripped of their regulatory 
responsibility over Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and other critics have charged that by delaying strong enforcement 
action against Lincoln, the government drove up the cost to taxpayers of the 
thrift's collapse to an estimated $2 billion. Lincoln is expected to be the 
most expensive thrift failure ever. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter, Waxman told Keating that "you have the (bank) board right where 
you want them" and predicted that Wall would agree to Keating's demands during 
a telephone conversation between the two men later that day. Waxman indicated 
that Wall already had expressed a favorable attitude toward Keating's demands. 
</P>
<P>
"As you know," she wrote, "I have put pressure on Wall to work toward meeting 
your demands, and he has so instructed his staff." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was written five days after the bank board voted 2 to 1 to remove 
the Lincoln case from the jurisdiction of the San Francisco office. It outlined 
five demands that Keating was to make during his conversation with Wall, most 
of which eventually were accepted by the bank board. 
</P>
<P>
Although the five steps previously have been portrayed by Wall as tough 
enforcement actions that were resisted by Keating, the Waxman letter suggests 
that Lincoln officials actually were pleased with the way the bank board had 
agreed to resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"The letter . . . tracks with amazing accuracy the actions taken by the board 
-- actions which were interpreted publicly as clamping down on Lincoln," said 
Gonzalez. "In reality, as the letter carefully explains, the actions were to be 
shams designed not to punish but to allow Keating an escape route." 
</P>
<P>
Wall has acknowledged that he met with Keating personally at least three times 
while Lincoln was under investigation by the bank board and also talked with 
him occasionally on the telephone. But he has denied that those contacts 
influenced his handling of the Lincoln case. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Wall said that he initiated the telephone call to Keating on May 
10, 1988, to tell him what the board had decided five days earlier and "to tell 
Keating to take it or leave it." 
</P>
<P>
At its May 5 meeting, the bank board decided to execute a so-called 
"supervisory agreement" against Lincoln, freezing the thrift's investments at 
their existing levels. In addition, the board decided to send a team of 
examiners to perform "on-site monitoring" of all important business decisions 
undertaken by Lincoln officials. 
</P>
<P>
After the exam, the board agreed, Lincoln could apply to be permanently 
supervised by another district office besides San Francisco, but only if the 
allegations raised by the San Francisco office were proven false. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Keating, however, Waxman said that Wall was prepared to agree 
that the San Francisco office would never again have jurisdiction over Lincoln. 
At the end of the examination, she said, Lincoln would be permitted to choose 
the district office that would oversee its operations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, San Francisco was permanently barred from investigating Lincoln, and 
bank board officials tried without success to assign the Irvine thrift to the 
Seattle district office, which Keating had chosen. The proposed transfer was 
blocked by Seattle officials, however, and Washington retained responsibility 
for the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco is finished," Waxman wrote. "There is no going back to San 
Francisco, and nothing can be done to follow up their exam." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Waxman's law firm, Sidley &amp; Austin, denied that it had 
brought any political pressure to bear on Wall to remove the Lincoln case from 
the jurisdiction of the San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
"The only 'pressure' beyond legal and policy arguments was our accurately 
advising the staff that (Keating) was considering filing a lawsuit against the 
board," the firm said.

BRITAIN RECALLS IRAQI AMBASSADOR IN RESPONSE TO EXECUTION; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: LONDON ALSO HALTS MINISTERIAL CONTACTS. THATCHER CALLS THE HANGING 
OF JOURNALIST 'BARBARIC.'

<P>
Britain on Thursday recalled its ambassador from Iraq and halted ministerial 
contacts with the government of President Saddam Hussein to protest Baghdad's 
hanging of a London-based journalist it accused of spying. 
</P>
<P>
"Thatcher wanted him alive. We sent him in a box," Information Minister Latif 
Nassayif Jassim said in breaking the news of the Thursday morning execution in 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had led the campaign to repeal the 
death sentence imposed on 32-year-old Farzad Bazoft. Bazoft was working for The 
Observer, a British weekly, investigating reports of an explosion at an Iraqi 
military facility when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq alleged that Bazoft had spied for Israel and Britain, charges that Bazoft 
and his colleagues denied. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an awful day for the newspaper," said Observer Editor Donald Trelford. 
"We have had one of our number killed for simply being a reporter." 
</P>
<P>
Trelford and about 200 journalists held a vigil outside the heavily guarded 
Iraqi Embassy here until word of Bazoft's execution broke. Journalists left a 
single candle burning in Bazoft's memory in St. Bride's Church, Fleet Street, 
London's former newspaper row. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein had said repeatedly that his country did not fear Britain's anger in 
executing the journalist, and the information minister repeated this after the 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems the British could not understand our psychology that we are not 
intimidated," Jassim said. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said: "This is a very, very grave and serious matter. The Iraqi 
government's action is an act of barbarism which is deeply repugnant to all 
civilized people." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced that Ambassador Harold Walker is being 
recalled from the Iraqi capital. Hurd called off a trade mission to Iraq and 
said all ministerial visits have been halted. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd also said that all six Iraqi military trainees in Britain are being 
ordered to leave the country. But he said that trade sanctions would likely 
harm Britain and "not alter the stance of this regime" in Iraq, so there were 
no plans to implement them. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has a trade surplus of about $648 million with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Bush Administration expressed regret Thursday but did not 
join the strong condemnation of the execution. 
</P>
<P>
Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist, was detained in September near a military 
industrial complex south of Baghdad. He was investigating reports that hundreds 
of people had died in an explosion at the complex in August. 
</P>
<P>
A British nurse, Daphne Parish, 52, was convicted on charges that she drove 
Bazoft to the Al Iskandaria military complex and was sentenced to 15 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Kealy, the British general consul in Baghdad, visited Bazoft shortly 
before his hanging at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In a British Broadcasting Corp. interview, Kealy said Bazoft looked 
"hollow-eyed and subdued" and repeated that he was not a spy. 
</P>
<P>
Bazoft, a stateless Iranian, was the son of an Iranian National Oil Co. 
manager. He never returned to Iran after moving to Britain as a teen-ager.

UNITE TO TOPPLE AFGHAN REGIME, LEADER OF COUP BID URGES REBELS

<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of last week's coup attempt against the pro-Moscow regime in Kabul 
says he is continuing the struggle and appealed to his supporters and to Afghan 
guerrillas to unite and overthrow President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
"My supporters are still fighting Najibullah," former Defense Minister 
Shahnawaz Tanai told about 30 journalists Wednesday at a guerrilla base near 
Dobanday, about 40 miles southeast of Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
Tanai repeated charges that the initial coup attempt March 6 failed because 
Soviet planes bombed his headquarters at Bagram air base, 30 miles north of 
Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
The news conference was held in a huge cave in a snow-capped mountainside. The 
base of the Hezb-i-Islami resistance group of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was guarded 
by about 50 guerrillas armed with anti-aircraft guns and U.S.-supplied Stinger 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Tanai addressed the journalists along with three other coup leaders, former air 
force chief Abdul Qadir Aqa, former army communications chief Brig. Gen. Ghulam 
Hazarat and former Politburo member Niaz Mohammed Mohmand. The three officers 
wore their Afghan military uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's coup attempt, rebel military units bombed Kabul, including the 
presidential palace, and fought street battles with forces loyal to Najibullah. 
It was the most serious threat to Najibullah's regime since the withdrawal 13 
months ago of Soviet troops supporting the government. 
</P>
<P>
Official and Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Tanai and 
about 20 other generals fled to Pakistan on March 7 as the coup failed. 
</P>
<P>
Tanai, a short man in his 40s with a thick mustache, conceded that he had lost 
contact with some of his supporters, but said, "I am trying to re-establish 
communications and mobilize my people against the regime." 
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all the moujahedeen (guerrillas), my soldiers and all my 
supporters to join hands and defeat Najibullah," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his assertion that he and his fellow coup leaders were not 
seeking political power but had hoped to end the war and hold elections within 
six months.

BUSH CRITICIZES U.S. DEMONSTRATORS IN MANAGUA

President Bush, clearly exasperated by Americans who have protested outside the 
U.S. Embassy in Managua, lashed out Thursday at American supporters of the 
Nicaraguan Sandinistas, saying they should accept the results of last month's 
election if they "want to help the people." 
</P>
<P>
In a question and answer session with a newspaper publishers' group at the 
White House, Bush also praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
repeated U.S. hopes for a "peaceful evolution" of the dispute over Lithuanian 
independence. Bush sent Gorbachev a letter Thursday congratulating the Soviet 
leader on his election Wednesday to the country's newly powerful presidency, 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's remarks about Americans in Nicaragua, coming in answer to a question 
that was only peripherally related, were unusual because he seldom goes out of 
his way to involve himself in ideological disputes. Recent news reports about 
protests at the embassy in Managua, however, appear to have disturbed him. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several years, thousands of Americans -- from church and peace 
groups as well as leftist political organizations -- have traveled to Nicaragua 
to work on Sandinista agricultural cooperatives and other government-supported 
projects. Many of them have participated in weekly demonstrations outside the 
U.S. Embassy that have been going on for years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many are protesting President Daniel Ortega's election loss last month. 
The demonstrators allege that opposition candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro 
won the election because of U.S. pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I am frustrated a little bit" by those criticisms, Bush said. The groups 
traveled to Nicaragua "allegedly to help the people of Nicaragua, and then 
Nicaragua has a free and fair election, and it turns out these people were 
interested in helping the Sandinistas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been expecting him to try to do this," said Dennis Marker in the 
Washington office of Witness for Peace, one of many groups that have sent 
Americans to Nicaragua over the last decade. "The reason people are protesting 
at the embassy is not because of who won the election, but because of the 
destructiveness of U.S. policy." 
</P>
<P>
Since the election, Marker said, some members of Chamorro's coalition have 
threatened to expel Americans who traveled to Nicaragua when the Sandinistas 
were in power. Bush's remarks could lend support to that effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast with his comments on Nicaragua, Bush had only positive words about 
Gorbachev, whom he referred to as a "reasonable man." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was worried about the extensive new powers Gorbachev will now have, 
Bush answered, "They've come out of the totalitarianism of the past. They give 
the new President great power, but I don't see it as a threat." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about U.S. policy toward Lithuania, which has declared its independence 
from the Soviets, Bush said, "There are certain standards of control over one's 
country or . . . territory that guide recognition." 
</P>
<P>
"The best role for the United States," he said, "is to encourage a peaceful 
evolution from now on." Bush praised Soviet officials for saying they would not 
use force to try to resolve the dispute over Lithuania's status. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said he remains opposed to the idea of cutting foreign aid to Israel 
and Egypt to provide more money for other countries, but he repeated his appeal 
to Congress to give him more discretion in how to spend foreign aid funds.

Poland on Thursday said its planned inclusion in German reunification talks is 
a diplomatic triumph that marks the end of the "Yalta era." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the real end of Yalta took place yesterday," government spokeswoman 
Malgorzata Niezabitowska said in a televised statement. 
</P>
<P>
She called the decision "a success for all Poles." 
</P>
<P>
Meeting Wednesday in Bonn, East and West Germany and the major World War II 
Allied powers -- the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet Union -- 
agreed to invite Poland to discuss border issues during their talks on 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Niezabitowska said the invitation ended an era that began in 1945 with the 
Yalta conference, at which U.S., Soviet and British leaders decided the postwar 
shape of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will be a good precedent and that every state from now on will be 
able to . . . participate at times when its fate is to be decided," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski appeared to raise the stakes 
by saying Warsaw wants a voice on topics other than border issues, such as 
Germany's political and military situation.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of Europe's most extraordinary statesmen sealed a highly symbolic 
understanding between them in a most unstatesmanlike way here Thursday -- over 
a friendly beer in a local pub. 
</P>
<P>
The statesmen: West German President Richard von Weizsaecker and his 
Czechoslovak counterpart, Vaclav Havel. They chose the 51st anniversary of the 
Nazi occupation of Prague to put an end to one painful chapter in the 
1,000-year-old relationship between their two countries and to begin a new, 
more hopeful one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fan of symbols in politics," Havel, the former dissident playwright, 
said of the date he chose to invite Von Weizsaecker for a 10-hour state visit. 
</P>
<P>
And after their formal talks and presidential speeches in the cavernous 
Vladislav Hall of Prague's Hradcany Castle, Havel, who doesn't think presidents 
should take themselves too seriously, initiated a surprise detour from the 
official program. 
</P>
<P>
About halfway through a scheduled "walkabout" from the castle to the famous 
Charles Bridge, the Czechoslovak president propelled his apparently delighted 
guest through the doors of the "Two Suns" pub on cobblestoned Neruda Street and 
ordered steins of light beer for them both. 
</P>
<P>
Startled security men and photographers, who weren't getting along all that 
well anyway, tripped over one another as they scrambled none too successfully 
to keep up with their quarry. They cheered up only slightly when somebody 
passed a couple of tankards to those stuck outside. 
</P>
<P>
Jiri Duffek, 69, a retired lawyer, had tears in his eyes as he watched the 
happy scene from a few yards away. In contrast to Thursday's warm sunshine, the 
streets were cold and snow-swept on March 15, 1939, when he and the rest of the 
city awoke to find Nazi tanks and occupation troops everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very bad day," Duffek recalled, and worse days were to come during 
the three years he would spend in a forced labor camp in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
German dictator Adolf Hitler surveyed his army's latest conquest that day 51 
years ago from the same hilltop castle from which Von Weizsaecker briefly 
greeted a crowd of several hundred Czechoslovaks and foreign tourists Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast couldn't have been greater Thursday, the Duffeks agreed, during a 
symbolic national reconciliation presided over by two very different men who 
nevertheless speak a common, visionary language. 
</P>
<P>
The silver-haired, patrician Von Weizsaecker looks like he was born in an 
expensive suit, and the gravelly voiced, puckish Havel always looks somehow as 
if he has never worn one before. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first attempt at democracy came to an abrupt end on March 15, 1939, when a 
certain madman in high boots broke into this castle to announce to the world 
that violence conquers freedom and human dignity," Havel told several hundred 
invited guests at Vladislav Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"The messenger of war broke in," the former political prisoner continued. "The 
messenger of crudity; the messenger of lies; the messenger of pride and evil, 
of injustice and cruelty. A mass murderer broke in, a murderer of nations." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Havel said, as Czechoslovakia begins its "second attempt at 
democracy . . . we welcome to this castle another guest: a representative of 
German democracy, a messenger of peace, a messenger of decency, a messenger of 
truth, a messenger of humanity -- the announcer of the news that violence must 
never again win over freedom, lies over truth and evil over human lives." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a noble initiative of Vaclav Havel that he invited his neighbor from 
the Federal Republic of Germany on March 15 to Prague," responded Von 
Weizsaecker. "Each of us at home understands the profound symbolism of this 
peaceful step. We are taking it, in conviction, together." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the "profound injustice" that the Nazis perpetrated on 
Czechoslovakia and the "unspeakable suffering" of the World War that soon 
followed. And he said he was grateful "for the confidence you have shown us 
Germans by receiving us here." 
</P>
<P>
Von Weizsaecker, who is often cited as the likely first President of a 
reunified Germany, said of negotiations toward that end now under way: "We 
Germans know very well how important it is that through our unification, we 
should not cause among our neighbors the emergence of any new or old 
anxieties." 
</P>
<P>
And in the sentence that drew the strongest applause of his remarks from those 
assembled, Von Weizsaecker added: "We have no territorial claim towards any 
neighbors."

KOHL ACCUSED OVER E. GERMAN ELECTION;

THE QUESTION OF CURRENCY REFORM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Chancellor Willy Brandt, the opposition Social Democrats' senior 
statesmen, bitterly accused Bonn's ruling Christian Democrats on Thursday of 
trampling on the dignity of East Germans during the election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He complained that in East Germany's first free elections, scheduled for 
Sunday, the "bad habits of West German election campaigns have been exported 
into the virgin electoral politics of East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, who is honorary chairman of the Social Democrats in both Germanys, 
implicitly singled out Chancellor Helmut Kohl, leader of the Christian 
Democrats, for attempting to intimidate East Germans by playing politics on the 
issue of currency reform. 
</P>
<P>
"East Germans directly affected or worried must be spared a further period of 
torture in limbo and be given clear answers as soon as possible after March 
18," he said, referring to the election. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, a wide range of East German public figures have complained that 
West Germany is more or less taking over the election campaign, and in the 
process treating the local candidates as puppets. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing that issue, Brandt told a news conference in Bonn: "In the coming 
period of transition, it is vital not to hurt the self-esteem of our East 
German compatriots but to strengthen their feeling of being partners worth the 
same as we are." 
</P>
<P>
Brandt also criticized Kohl's attempts to keep other nations' participation in 
German reunification talks to a minimum, including his original plan to bar 
Poland, and his insensitivity on the Polish border issue. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt urged that the talks include all of Germany's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, 76, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic openings to East 
Germany and the Communist Bloc, also differed with Kohl on how German 
reunification might be achieved. Kohl has said repeatedly that the simplest way 
would be for an East German parliament to vote to adopt the West German 
constitution -- in effect, vote for a merger on West German terms. 
</P>
<P>
But Brandt said the best way would be a referendum drawn up and voted upon by 
both German states. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the momentum toward reunification, pushed by Kohl, "the joy that 
the train (of unity) is rolling has become mixed with the worries of those who 
fear falling under its wheels," Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, who is immensely popular in East Germany, was wheeled into action 
during the final days of the campaign, observers suggest, because recent polls 
show the alliance of conservative parties in East Germany pulling up even with 
the Social Democratic Party, which had previously enjoyed a strong lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the East German conservatives suffered their own setback Wednesday when the 
leader of one of the parties in the coalition resigned after admitting that he 
had been an informant for the ousted Stalinist regime's hated security police, 
known as the Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Democratic Awakening Party elected pastor Rainer Eppelmann as 
its new leader. The 47-year-old former peace campaigner took over from 
disgraced ex-chairman Wolfgang Schnur, whom the party voted to expel. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised statement, Eppelmann appealed to voters not to allow "this human 
and political tragedy" to turn them away from Democratic Awakening, which is 
part of the three-party Alliance for Germany backed by Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the outgoing four-month-old coalition Cabinet under reform Communist 
Prime Minister Hans Modrow held its last session. It said the economy has begun 
to stabilize despite a continuing drain of workers emigrating to West Germany.

KENYA HOLDS 2 IN SLAYING OF BRITISH TOURIST

Authorities here have taken two game rangers into custody in connection with 
the 1988 murder of a British tourist in one of Kenya's most popular game parks, 
police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The detentions result from an investigation by two Scotland Yard detectives who 
were sent to Kenya at the request of President Daniel Arap Moi after the Kenyan 
police probe of the crime developed into an international embarrassment for 
this tourist-dependent country. 
</P>
<P>
There are two teams of Scotland Yard investigators currently at work in Kenya. 
The second team, also here at the government's request, is investigating the 
murder last month of Kenyan Foreign Minister Robert J. Ouko, whose charred body 
was found not far from his home in western Kenya three days after his family 
reported him missing. 
</P>
<P>
The detention of the two unidentified rangers (authorities here declined to say 
the men were "arrested," but made it clear they could be charged within 72 
hours) marks the first major break in the investigation of the killing of Julie 
Ward, 28. 
</P>
<P>
Ward disappeared while driving alone in the Masai Mara Game Reserve in early 
September, 1988. After her father, a wealthy British hotelier, arrived in Kenya 
to conduct a search, the burned and slashed remains of her leg and jawbone were 
found in a remote corner of the park, which is southwest of Nairobi on the 
Tanzanian border. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police at first contended that she had unwisely wandered away from her 
jeep and was killed by wild animals. Later they suggested she had committed 
suicide. But evidence unearthed by Ward's family showed she was probably 
murdered, and the woman's father charged that the likeliest suspects were park 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
He also charged that Kenyan officials were trying to cover up the murder to 
protect the country's tourist trade, which last year attracted 700,000 game 
viewers to Kenya. Tourism brought about $360 million into the country in 1988 
and is Kenya's largest earner of foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
At a month-long inquest held here a year after Julie Ward's death, Kenyan 
police officials acknowledged that they had never questioned or investigated 
the movements of any of the park rangers on duty at the time of her 
disappearance. The inquest ended with a ruling that Ward had indeed been 
murdered. President Moi's request for Scotland Yard's assistance followed.

AGENT TELLS OF POINDEXTER-NORTH PARLEYS 
</P>

<P>
Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter acknowledged during the 
height of the Iran-Contra scandal that he had discussed the covert operation 
regularly with Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and could have stopped it, an FBI agent 
testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Poindexter had denied any direct involvement in the affair, putting the 
blame squarely on North, said FBI agent Ellen Glasser, who interviewed 
Poindexter in his suburban home in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the agent's account was damaging to Poindexter, the retired rear 
admiral who is being tried on one count of joining North in a conspiracy to 
divert profits from Iran arms sales to the Contras in Nicaragua and on four 
counts of obstructing and lying to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Glasser also testified that more than 5,000 messages were hurriedly deleted 
from Poindexter's computer just before the White House forced his resignation 
as the Iran-Contra affair developed into a major scandal for the Ronald Reagan 
Administration in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Although he allowed Glasser to continue testifying, U.S. District Judge Harold 
H. Greene was clearly troubled by the agent's failure to inform Poindexter that 
he was being interviewed as a potential suspect in a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Glasser, who has worked for the FBI for eight years, told the court that she 
and another agent arrived at Poindexter's home on Nov. 28, 1986, three days 
after his resignation, to determine whether any National Security Council 
documents were kept in his home safe. 
</P>
<P>
None were found, Glasser said, but she took the opportunity to talk with 
Poindexter in his living room in the presence of his wife and the other FBI 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter told Glasser that he had "no working knowledge" of the arms 
shipments that the Administration had made to Iran in hopes of obtaining the 
release of American hostages held by Iran-influenced Islamic fundamentalists in 
Lebanon, the agent testified. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the diversion of profits from the arms sales to the Contras, 
Poindexter "stated that he had no direct knowledge of this, but said that 
Oliver North was on his staff, was committed to the Contras and was up to 
something," Glasser testified. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, the agent went on, said "that he discussed it with him regularly 
and he said he could have stopped Ollie." 
</P>
<P>
But, asked whether he knew of any destruction of documents at the National 
Security Council, "he said he did not," Glasser testified. 
</P>
<P>
Glasser said that she took no notes while talking with Poindexter for 15 
minutes or so but that she pulled out a legal pad from her briefcase when she 
got into the FBI car outside the Poindexter home and wrote everything down. 
</P>
<P>
Greene questioned Glasser closely about whether she had any right to interview 
Poindexter, the highest-ranking Reagan Administration official to be tried in 
the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was safe to say that we were investigating him as a potential 
suspect," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
But Greene, in a series of questions, drew from her the admission that the FBI 
agents had never told that to Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
In their testimony Thursday, Glasser and Kelly Williams, a former Army computer 
expert, described a feverish but ultimately futile attempt to erase almost all 
the messages from the computers of Poindexter and North before their ouster 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Although deleted, these messages eventually were recovered from a backup tape 
that the White House Communications Agency kept of all traffic on White House 
computers. Some of the messages are part of the evidence in Poindexter's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Glasser testified that, although Poindexter's computer had more than 5,000 
messages in its files on Nov. 22, 1986, "by 9 a.m. on Nov. 24, there were zero 
messages left." That was a day before the White House asked for his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly testified that the messages in North's computer were reduced from 737 to 
only one during the week of Nov. 22, 1986. North was dismissed on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
That one remaining message, Kelly said, was a small note from Poindexter that 
authorized North to communicate directly with his boss without going through 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday's testimony began, special prosecutor Dan K. Webb told Greene 
that he had decided to call fewer witnesses than originally planned and 
probably would rest his case by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't the foggiest idea of how much information we could get from Oliver 
North in his four days of testimony," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, North had revealed to the jury "the fabric of Iran-Contra," and 
it would not be necessary to call such witnesses as retired Air Force Maj. Gen. 
Richard V. Secord, who ran some of the operations for North. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Thursday, defense attorney Joseph Small demanded a mistrial, 
accusing the prosecution of altering a document that was presented as a trial 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Greene refused the request when he discovered that the exhibit had not been 
altered by the government, and he lectured Small sternly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want you to try that stunt again," the judge said. "People don't get 
up in my court and accuse other counsel . . . of bad faith or misconduct unless 
there's a pretty good case for it."

Engineers at Kennedy Space Center, Fla., radioed commands to a stranded 
$150-million communications satellite to fire on-board rockets in a bid to 
boost the errant relay station into a higher, long-term storage orbit. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, it will reach a safe orbit sometime today, preventing an 
inadvertent re-entry into the atmosphere and providing plenty of time to devise 
a rescue plan. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration indicated that 
it would consider a rescue by a space shuttle if the satellite reaches a safe 
orbit. The Intelsat 6 satellite was stranded in a useless, lopsided orbit when 
it failed to separate properly from its Titan 3 booster.

With more than 170 years of tradition under their wings, the buzzards returned 
as scheduled to Hinckley, Ohio, delighting buzzard watchers from across the 
country who had been waiting since before dawn. According to local folklore, 
the buzzards, or turkey vultures, have returned to this small northeastern Ohio 
town yearly on March 15 since 1819, when frozen carcasses from a Christmas Eve 
community hunt began defrosting. About 150 people, including a dozen wearing 
buzzard costumes, awaited the large black scavengers.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Thursday signed a full-power license for 
the Seabrook nuclear power plant, ending any chance that opponents will be able 
to prevent it from operating before court appeals are completed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major victory for New England consumers," said Edward Brown, 
president of New Hampshire Yankee, which operates Seabrook. 
</P>
<P>
"Our 17-year licensing saga is over." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents said the legal battle to shut down the plant would continue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet begun to fight," said Scott Denman, director of the Safe 
Energy Communication Council, an anti-Seabrook group that has been assisting in 
the legal battle. "The lawsuit will go on, and the final outcome is yet to be 
known." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Murley, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, made 
the license official two weeks after the commission voted to allow the New 
Hampshire plant to operate commercially. The NRC placed a two-week hold on its 
vote to allow time for filing court appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman John Kopeck said Thursday that the license had been 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
The signing came a day after the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington refused to 
block the issuance of the license.

POLITICS TV CAMPAIGNING; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON IS FIRST TO FIRE BACK AT FEINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Democratic candidate for governor Dianne Feinstein gained strength and oomph 
with a powerful early television advertising campaign, the question has 
followed her: When will her rivals feel they must start firing back with their 
own campaigns on the airwaves? 
</P>
<P>
The answer came Thursday night as the first counter-volley was aired in Fresno 
and Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
The new commercial did not come from fellow Democrat John K. Van de Kamp. 
Instead, it was the work of Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who has no 
serious primary election opposition in June, but does have a bulging financial 
war chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Vision" is the title of the 60-second Wilson commercial, crafted in the 
biography genre. 
</P>
<P>
Distinctly nonpartisan in tone and containing no reference to Wilson's party 
affiliation, the ad has a local-government flavor which seemed aimed at 
Feinstein's rising star -- as if to pit former San Diego Mayor Wilson against 
former San Francisco Mayor Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson chose as his slogan one that some voters may recall. "Pete Wilson -- 
taking charge of California's future." It was last used in 1988: "Michael 
Dukakis -- Let's take charge of America's future." 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson TV spot emphasizes his environmental credentials, fiscal management 
and -- as Feinstein did in her commercial -- his support for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wilson nor Feinstein supported the tax-cutting Proposition 13 in 1978. 
But Wilson's ad includes a quote from Prop. 13's author, the late Howard 
Jarvis: "We wouldn't have needed Prop. 13 if everyone had run their cities like 
Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
If Republicans wanted a pro-growth, sky's-the-limit candidate, this commercial 
will prove a disappointing start by their nominee-apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does it remind watchers that Wilson has long fought against offshore 
oil drilling, it declares: "Before the environmental movement had begun, he 
wrote the first coastal protection act to limit development of our coastline. . 
. . He was the first big-city mayor in the country to lay down the law to 
developers to control growth and preserve open space." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the commercial notes that Wilson co-authored a federal law providing 
the death penalty for people who kill federal drug agents. 
</P>
<P>
Although shown first in smaller markets, the Wilson spot is expected to move 
into larger areas soon, sources said. The choice of Fresno and Eureka comes at 
a time when Feinstein is on the air with her highly rated 30-second 
biographical commercial in Eureka and has just finished a run in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's campaign has shown no indication of airing its own commericials 
in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats reacted sarcastically to the early move by Wilson. "I would have 
thought that the $16 million he spent two years ago (in his campaign for the 
U.S. Senate) would have acquainted voters in Fresno with his biography. I guess 
it's not that memorable," said Van de Kamp campaign lieutenant Duane Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein campaign manager William Carrick wondered if the Dukakis-esque slogan 
would be followed with other similarities: "Next I guess we'll hear about the 
San Diego miracle."

Henry Voss narrowly won Senate confirmation Thursday as the state's top 
agriculture official despite protests about aerial pesticide spraying to combat 
the Mediterranean fruit fly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The former California Farm Bureau president and Central Valley peach farmer 
appointed by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian last May was confirmed on a 22-7 
vote -- only one vote more than the 21 needed. 
</P>
<P>
The vote reflected a desire by Republicans not to oppose the governor, and a 
desire by rural Democrats not to oppose farmers. Seven Democrats, most from the 
Los Angeles area, voted against confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Voss is not expected to serve much beyond January, when Deukmejian retires and 
a new governor takes his place. Even the likely Republican gubernatorial 
nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, has said he wants to take responsibility for 
pesticide control from the Department of Food and Agriculture and place it with 
a new environmental agency. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), one of Voss' most vigorous opponents, said 
his immediate ouster was important, to send a message to Deukmejian and to 
protect the health of farm workers and residents in areas where malathion is 
sprayed to fight the crop-destroying Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti, another Los Angeles Democrat, said 
he hoped Voss' narrow confirmation vote will send a message to the agriculture 
community that it must come up with an alternative to malathion spraying, which 
is criticized as an annoyance and a potential health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno during floor debate agreed that 
pesticide control measures "need to come into the current day." 
</P>
<P>
But Maddy argued that Voss is "as receptive as anyone we can find" to 
accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
He said Voss understands the state's $15-billion-a-year agriculture industry 
and added that much of the criticism of his department stems from incidents 
that occurred before his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
But Senate Democratic leader Barry Keene of Benicia disagrees, charging that 
putting Voss in charge of pesticide control is "like putting John Hinckley (who 
attempted to assassinate former President Reagan) in charge of the Secret 
Service." 
</P>
<P>
Keene also said that the Farm Bureau, Voss' former employer, is a highly 
conservative organization with ties to the chemical industry and said it has 
not even served farmers well.

ALTERNATIVE-FUEL CARS PUSHED ON A BUMPY SENATE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Conceding that they face a tough fight, the two leading U.S. Senate backers of 
legislation calling for smog-reducing alternative-fuel cars said Thursday that 
an intensive lobbying drive is under way to gain its passage. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial requirement, contained in a clean air amendment authored by 
Sens. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), is expected to be 
taken up on the Senate floor next week when Congress returns from a week's 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
The battle is being closely watched by air pollution officials in California, 
New York and other states with severe smog problems. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment is opposed by the White House and Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who previously announced they had reached a compromise on 
a new federal clean air measure that does not include the alternative-fuel car 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
Originally contained in President Bush's clean air proposal submitted to 
Congress last year, the provision was vigorously opposed by the oil and 
automobile industries. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Colorado, Wirth said it will be difficult to 
round up enough votes, in light of the opposition. He said opponents worry that 
if the amendment is adopted, the compromise on the clean air measure will fall 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
"They obviously view this as a deal-buster," Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, meeting with reporters at South Coast Air Quality Management District 
headquarters in El Monte, agreed. "It is very tough," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth said he counted 20 solid votes for the amendment and another seven 
possible votes. 
</P>
<P>
As Wirth was telephoning senators asking for their votes, Wilson was thanking 
AQMD officials for rallying support among their counterparts in other states. 
He urged them to continue. 
</P>
<P>
California officials plan next September to require auto makers to build 
alternative-fuel cars, even if Congress fails to act. But Wilson and others 
noted Thursday that 20% to 25% of cars registered in California are purchased 
out of state, where tailpipe emission standards are not as strict. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, they said tougher federal tailpipe standards -- also called 
for in the Wirth-Wilson amendment -- are important to California's 
anti-pollution efforts.

O.C. SCHOOLS MOVE TO STEM SPORTS-RELATED VIOLENCE 
</P>

Principals of six schools in the Fullerton Union High School District on 
Thursday adopted a policy that allows schools to suspend coaches or players who 
are ejected from sports events, involved in altercations or leave the sidelines 
or bench during an altercation. 
</P>
<P>
The policy represents the toughest action yet in Southern California against 
increasing violence at prep sports events. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where I was afraid to open Saturday morning's paper and 
read about the next incident," said La Habra High School Principal Tom Triggs, 
who proposed the policy. "I kept hearing, 'Something has to be done.' Well, 
we've done something. It's in writing so every coach and player knows what is 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy: 
</P>
<P>
* Coaches or athletes who are ejected from a sports event will be suspended for 
the next game. 
</P>
<P>
* Any athlete who leaves the bench or sidelines during an altercation will be 
suspended for the next game. 
</P>
<P>
* Any athlete who assaults or strikes another athlete, coach or official will 
be suspended from all prep athletics for one calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was announced by representatives of the Freeway League, which 
includes Buena Park, Fullerton, La Habra, Sonora, Sunny Hills and Troy high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Under current policy for the California Interscholastic Federation's Southern 
Section, major incidents of violence are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by 
section administrators. Thursday's action was in response to eight major, 
violent incidents that have been reported in the Southern Section this school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents included an attack on two football officials by three Palmdale 
players during a game at College of Canyons in Valencia; an attack on two 
basketball referees by three Victor Valley players during a game at Moreno 
Valley High School; an assault on a basketball referee by a fan at a Sunny 
Hills-Fullerton game in Fullerton; and a fight between basketball players from 
Servite High in Anaheim and St. Paul High in Santa Fe Springs after a game at 
Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the eight incidents have been in Orange County, including a fight 
between basketball players from Villa Park High and El Modena High in Orange. 
After that incident, Walt Otto, Villa Park principal, said he would consider 
playing next year's games between the schools in an empty gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
The Freeway League also plans to schedule a series of workshops for activity 
directors, boosters, students and student advisers to review the rules and 
regulations and to outline the responsibility of administrators for the 
behavior of students at athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
"Our next challenge is to come up with some type of policy for student sections 
at the games," Triggs said. 
</P>
<P>
George Giokaris, principal at Sunny Hills High in Fullerton, announced the 
Freeway League's policy at the Southern Section's general council meeting. The 
announcement drew applause from principals representing the section's 66 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Jacobson, president of the section's executive committee and principal at 
Corona del Mar High, said he hoped the section would follow the lead of the 
Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
"Possibly some sectionwide decisions for all of us will come out of this," 
Jacobson said. "At the very least, I hope other leagues would take this 
leadership from the Freeway League." 
</P>
<P>
John Moore, girls athletic director at Trabuco Hills High in Mission Viejo and 
a prominent basketball official at the high school and college level, also 
applauded the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The principals are sending a message to the athletes in writing," Moore said. 
"It's good to see something like this come from the principals. This way, it's 
not a coach's rule but the principal's rule, and that will carry more weight." 
</P>
<P>
Julian Weaver, representative of the San Andreas League in northern San 
Bernardino County and principal at Victor Valley High, said his league soon 
will announce a similar policy. Weaver suspended three basketball players for 
the season for attacking a referee in December at the Moreno Valley Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a policy for high school athletes who seem to be emulating the actions 
of professional and college athletes," Weaver said. "The current trend is 
disturbing and we all need to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Freeway League principals also adopted a rule that eliminates the coaching box 
for its basketball coaches. Under current national rules for prep sports, 
coaches are allowed to stand during the game in a three-foot-wide area known as 
a coaching box. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new Freeway League policy, coaches must remain seated at all times, 
except during timeouts or when a player is injured. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize the volatile nature of the game of basketball and thought it 
would be best if the coaches remain on the bench," Giokaris said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the Southern Section adopted a "seat-belt" policy in which 
coaches were required to remain seated, but the policy was dropped after one 
season.

SENATE PASSES BILL ALLOWING IT TO OUST DISHONEST APPOINTEES 
</P>

<P>
The Senate voted 33 to 1 Thursday to approve a bill that would give it power to 
remove any public appointee who falsifies qualifications during confirmation 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was introduced by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) after The Times 
revealed in December that California State University Chairwoman Marianthi 
Lansdale of Huntington Beach falsely claimed during her nomination process to 
have earned an associate of arts degree in 1959 from Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said Thursday that the Lansdale case highlighted a weakness in the 
political appointments process because there is no provision for removing an 
appointee should it be learned that he or she supplied phony credentials. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow the Senate, which must approve gubernatorial appointments, 
to reconvene confirmation hearings and to remove an errant official on a 
two-thirds vote. Hart's bill originally included a provision for criminal 
sanctions for perjury, but a committee dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important that the Senate have a process in place where we can 
bring an already confirmed appointee back for questioning if that appointee 
misrepresents his or her background," Hart said. "Otherwise, the integrity of 
the appointments process comes into question." 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale publicly apologized for making the false claim, but she has repeatedly 
refused to comply with requests from Senate President Pro Tempore David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to step down. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who appointed Lansdale, said earlier this year that she 
made a mistake in claiming the degree but that he would not ask her to give up 
the position. She heads a 24-member board that makes policy decisions for one 
of the largest public university systems in the world. The position is unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale and her husband, developer William M. (Bit) Lansdale, donated more 
than $100,000 to Deukmejian and gave him the use of a corporate plane during 
the 1982 race, campaign records show.

MAKING GANGS THE BAD GUYS; 
</P>
<P>
PRIDE CLUB: PROJECT STARTED IN TERRITORY INFILTRATED BY SANTA ANA GANGS GIVES 
FOURTH-, FIFTH- AND SIXTH-GRADERS ANOTHER WAY TO GO.

"On my honor, I will pledge to help the city of Santa Ana fight the gang 
problem by not becoming a gang member myself. . . . I pledge to do my best and 
to help others remain gang free." 
</P>
<P>
These are serious words for fourth-graders, but they may help keep some 
children out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge is for the Pride Club, a city parks and recreation program designed 
to win the hearts and minds of fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders before the 
gangs do. The stakes are high in Santa Ana, which has an estimated 7,000 active 
gang members, highest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never join a gang because it will ruin my life," said Corina Torrez, a 
10-year-old club member. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Santa Ana's 2-year-old Pride program will receive the 1989 California 
Parks and Recreation Society's award of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Pride -- which stands for Parks and Recreation Inspire Dignity and Esteem -- is 
an eight-week course as well as an after-school club. The greatest challenge is 
to break through a child's acceptance of gangs, program coordinator Jenny Rios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids can be very cynical and sarcastic about a program like Pride if they 
think gangs aren't that bad," Rios added. 
</P>
<P>
For many children, gangs are part of their neighborhood, part of their family. 
Some of the children have brothers, uncles, even fathers who are in gangs, 
Erendira Moreno, a Pride instructor, explained. 
</P>
<P>
The younger ones do not know whether gang members are heroes or criminals, 
those close to the problem say. The older ones know the initiations, the 
slogans, the hand signals, the colors. 
</P>
<P>
Pride tries to show the children that gangs are not just about colors and 
slogans, Moreno said. Pride shows that gangs kill people too. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students say they do not want to join gangs for fear that they 
would be beaten or killed. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Morfin, 9, lives in the Lopers gang territory in the east side of the 
city. Some friends have asked him to join. 
</P>
<P>
"No way," Luis said. "They beat people up." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana City Council approved Pride as a pilot project after the number 
of gang-related crimes tripled from 123 in 1976 to 393 in 1987. The program was 
launched in six schools with chronic gang problems and is now at 10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the eight-week course was offered to fifth graders but was 
channeled to fourth graders when school officials noticed that the younger 
children were already knowledgeable about gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Children who live in gang neighborhoods have to know there are choices other 
than gangs, said Tony Borbon, director of Turning Point Gang Prevention and 
Intervention, an outreach program in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"If programs like Pride don't start in elementary schools, these kids can 
easily turn to gangs by junior high and they will be gone," Borbon said. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs are commonplace in the Glenn Martin Elementary School neighborhood. 
Lopers hang out west of the neighborhood; F-Troop is on the east; the Crips on 
the north, and the south side is carved up among all three. 
</P>
<P>
But the Martin school has about 50 Pride members. They faithfully attend club 
meetings. They have after-school activities and are taught self-esteem skills. 
Fourth-grader Carlos, whose last name has been withheld, joined the Martin 
school Pride club recently. He recited the pledge proudly and has received a 
membership card. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the gangs look "cool" to him, he says. But he knows that many of his 
neighbors live in constant fear of gang members. He's frank about why he won't 
join a gang. 
</P>
<P>
"They scare me," Carlos said.

UCI STUDENTS LOBBY REGENTS ON HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine student activists seeking campus housing for gay, lesbian and 
unmarried couples took their 2-month-old protest to the University of 
California Board of Regents meeting in Los Angeles Thursday and won a qualified 
commitment to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen placard-waving UC Irvine students, joined by an equal number of 
UCLA students, had stationed themselves strategically between the regents' 
meeting hall and a nearby luncheon area. And UCI officials inside the meeting 
room had conveyed the students' desire to speak to them about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic worked. Several regents, including former congresswoman and Los 
Angeles county supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke and regents' Vice Chairman 
Meredith J. Khachigian of San Clemente stopped to speak to the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"This matter will likely come before the Regents Committee on Educational 
Policy," predicted Regent Yori Wada of San Francisco. "And I'd be inclined to 
support it," he added, after protest leaders asserted that current UC housing 
rules violate the UC system's policy against discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is an inequity that exists and we will have to examine the 
issue," said Burke, now a lawyer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But she added that changing the legal definitions of marriage and the family 
are matters more properly addressed by the state Legislature and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Khachigian asked student leaders whether there was support for unmarried 
student housing on campus. When told that more than 800 signatures were 
collected on petitions supporting such a change in housing policies, she said, 
"I think I'd have to do a lot more studying on this issue, but I'm willing to 
study it." 
</P>
<P>
Students hailed the impromptu meeting as a success. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed with their courage -- those who stopped to ask why we were 
here, those who said they would examine the issue and those who expressed 
support for our position," said UCI student Jacqueline Sowell, 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they've consented to a dialogue on this issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
UCI students first attracted public attention with a recent march on the 
chancellor's office and a 10-day vigil outside the campus administration 
building in cardboard lean-tos dubbed "Shantytown." 
</P>
<P>
The protest was in reaction to Chancellor Jack W. Peltason's decision in 
January to strictly enforce rules for family housing on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason has said he is committed to equal treatment of individuals regardless 
of their sexual orientation and contends that student housing policy is 
determined by state law. KRIS LINDGREN

CITY STAFF REMODELS BUILDING PERMIT BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A city official says a recent court order blocking the city from issuing 
residential building permits applies only to new construction and remodeling, 
not repairs to plumbing or electrical systems. 
</P>
<P>
Included under the "remodeling" category are the addition of new windows, 
load-bearing walls, exterior walls, roofing and room additions, Director of 
Development Lee Whittenberg told the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
The city is still able to issue permits for any remodeling or new construction 
of detached buildings such as a free-standing shed or garage, Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The city normally issues 25 to 30 permits a month for new residential 
construction and remodeling, according to city staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Whittenberg told council members he is "not quite sure" how to interpret the 
March 6 verbal ruling by Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Ronald L. 
Bauer. The commissioner is expected to issue a written order in the next few 
weeks which should clarify his ruling, Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys and staff members are hoping the written order will allow the 
staff to issue permits for remodeling and specifically restrict only new 
residential construction, Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, this is basically a wait-and-see kind of thing," he said. "We 
expected to have it (the written order) last week -- now we're not sure when to 
expect it. We could get it tomorrow or three weeks from now." 
</P>
<P>
The order restricting construction will remain in effect until the city updates 
its local housing plan, which should have been revised by the city and approved 
by the state Department of Housing and Community Development last summer. By 
May, the City Council is expected to approve a new housing plan, a document 
that addresses the city's future housing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach is one of 16 Orange County cities that either failed to submit 
housing plans by last summer's deadline or turned in plans that did not include 
adequate strategies for dealing with issues such as low-income housing, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to council member Joe Hunt, the council made a mistake by not making 
the housing plan a priority. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those things we just let slide," Hunt said. "The council sets 
priorities for staff, and this was not one of them." MICHELLE NICOLOSI

PARENTS' ROLE IN EDUCATION STRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 250 people turned out this week for a "Successful Parents" conference 
that included seminars on self-esteem, the dangers of steroids and gang 
violence in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The third annual conference emphasized the need for parental support of 
education and gave parents the chance to talk with education experts, said 
program chairwoman Jane Wyner. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, keynote speaker at the Wednesday night 
gathering, said schools are increasingly emphasizing the role of the parent in 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's indicative of the growing knowledge that parents are going to be 
a critical component of developing an educational strategy for the United 
States," Vasquez said. "They (school districts) realize that they cannot 
succeed in the classroom -- they have to go beyond the classroom." While Wyner 
was pleased at the turnout for the program at Orange High School, she said such 
events don't always reach the parents of the children who need help the most. 
</P>
<P>
"What we figure is that 20% of the parents here are looking for assistance in 
some way," Wyner said. "Honestly, 80% are already magnificent parents and 
that's why they're here. But there's that 20% we catch that means everything to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The program was sponsored by the Orange Unified School District. LAURA

COUNTY CONFIRMS $475,000 SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Breaking weeks of silence, the county formally disclosed Thursday that it has 
paid a private investigator $475,000 to settle two federal lawsuits alleging 
that Sheriff Brad Gates improperly investigated his critics and issued gun 
permits to his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm resigned to the fact that it is over. It wasn't worth it," said Preston 
Guillory, 45, of Santa Ana, who has pursued the sheriff in court for more than 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory, Ty Ritter and his brother Frank first sued Gates in U.S. District 
Court 11 years ago after they were repeatedly denied concealed weapons permits 
-- Guillory for a perceived lack of moral character and the Ritters, who had a 
bodyguard business, on grounds they lacked a good reason to have one. 
</P>
<P>
They charged that Gates' gun permit process was so capricious and fraught with 
cronyism that it violated their constitutional right of due process. Although 
Guillory has dropped out of the case, the Ritters are continuing the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory sued again in 1985, alleging that Gates improperly initiated an 
unsuccessful criminal prosecution of him because he had filed the gun permit 
suit and was working as a private investigator on behalf of a political 
opponent of the sheriff. Last March, a jury awarded Guillory $189,894 in 
damages, but both sides appealed aspects of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gates has maintained that his process of granting or denying concealed weapons 
permits is fair and that those given the privilege have legitimate reasons and 
good moral backgrounds. In the second lawsuit, the sheriff contended that there 
was enough evidence to justify a criminal investigation of Guillory. Gates and 
his attorneys declined to comment on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The county officially announced the settlement Thursday in a terse two-page 
news release that sets forth the basics of the agreement worked out last month. 
The Times reported on Feb. 17 that the county had paid $475,000 to end the 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement, Guillory received almost $290,000, while the 
county paid his lawyers, Michael Cisarik and Meir J. Westreich, $185,000 in 
legal fees. In addition, Guillory agreed not to testify on behalf of the 
Ritters or seek a concealed weapons permit for at least two years in Southern 
California. DAN WEIKEL

KOVIC ENDORSES YUDELSON IN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic may have decided not to run against Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove), but he has not disappeared from the Orange County 
political scene. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Yudelson, one of two Democratic candidates for the 72nd Assembly District 
seat held by Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), announced Thursday that he has the 
endorsement of Kovic, whose life is portrayed in the movie "Born on the Fourth 
of July." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic could not be reached for comment Thursday, but in a statement released by 
Yudelson's Assembly campaign office, Kovic says that Yudelson has his "full 
support and endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson said he is "pleased to receive the endorsement of a remarkable man." 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson's Democratic opponent in the June primary is Tom Umberg, a former 
federal prosecutor who lives in Garden Grove. Umberg said that he had not 
sought Kovic's endorsement.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; 
</P>
<P>
20,000 EXPECTED AT ST. PATRICK'S PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A St. Patrick's Day parade that started because of a $10 bet celebrates its 
21st anniversary Saturday, and organizers are predicting that 20,000 people 
will attend the event. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo St. Patrick's Day Parade began in 1970 when one community 
resident bet another that no more than 200 people would join an Irish march 
down one of the community's main thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people showed up that day, however, and the parade has become a 
staple of South Orange County's St. Patrick's Day festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically every kid in South Orange County has been in that parade at some 
point or another," said John Ben, a longtime Mission Viejo resident and one of 
the parade's organizers. "It's become quite a tradition." 
</P>
<P>
This year's parade will take off at noon Saturday from the corner of Alicia 
Parkway and Olympiad Road and proceed toward Lake Mission Viejo, where it will 
wind up near the shore. More than 6,000 marchers are expected. The Disney 
cartoon character Roger Rabbit will be this year's grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Shriners, equestrian groups, high school bands, floats 
and local dignitaries are among the 148 entries in the parade. Prizes will be 
awarded for the best band and for other categories. The group deemed most 
humorous will receive the parade's prized Leprechaun. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's Irish for the day," Ben said. "We've got a real good Irish flavor 
here in Mission Viejo."

CITY MULLS FINANCING ARENA PROJECT ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with increasing cost estimates for an indoor sports arena, officials are 
considering whether to finance the entire project with city funds instead of 
relying on the project's private developer for financing, a councilman said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In closed-door meetings Thursday, council members were briefed on the status of 
negotiations with the developer, Ogden Corp. of New York. The developer has 
informed the city that it will cost $94 million to build the 20,000-seat arena 
instead of the previously quoted $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the city is weighing several options, including paying part of 
the $9-million increase or bringing in a new developer, Councilman William D. 
Ehrle said. 
</P>
<P>
But if the city must pay a portion of construction costs, Ehrle said, "why not 
do the whole thing?" 
</P>
<P>
"We could do that (finance arena construction) ourselves," Ehrle said. "We have 
the bond-raising (capability). It's something I'm going to consider." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we haven't done it before," he said, referring to the city-built 
Anaheim Stadium and Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. Los Angeles attorney 
Neil Papiano, who has represented Ogden, also did not return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
How this development affects Anaheim's race to build an arena before a nearly 
identical one goes up in Santa Ana was unclear Thursday. Both cities hope to 
attract professional hockey or basketball franchises. 
</P>
<P>
A change in financing may force Anaheim to begin anew the environmental review 
of the arena, further delaying the project, according to attorney William D. 
Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Ross represents Anaheim Stadium Associates, which along with the Los Angeles 
Rams and a mobile home park, have challenged the arena environmental review and 
have temporarily blocked construction. 
</P>
<P>
Under a tentative agreement, Ogden is to arrange financing for arena 
construction, then operate the facility for the city. The plan also calls for 
the city to provide the land, which so far has cost Anaheim $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the revised estimate may be a sign that Ogden wants out of the 
project, Ehrle said, "Not necessarily." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they wish the project could have moved along faster," he said. "But to 
say they want to pull tent, I don't think that's true." 
</P>
<P>
If Ogden were to drop out, Anaheim could proceed on its own or with another 
developer, Ehrle said. MARK LANDSBAUM

ACTIVISTS TO LINK HOMELESS CENSUS, VOTER REGISTRATION; 
</P>
<P>
OUTREACH: THE DRIVE IS CALLED THE FIRST MAJOR EFFORT TO REGISTER STREET PEOPLE. 
COURTS HAVE AFFIRMED THEIR ELIGIBILITY TO VOTE.

<P>
State and local activists plan to mount the most far-reaching effort to date in 
California to register street people to vote when the U.S. Census Bureau 
conducts its landmark count of the homeless next week. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates this week described the campaign as the first significant 
statewide effort to register homeless residents since the courts affirmed their 
eligibility to vote four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real need for the homeless to have more of a voice in what is 
happening to them," said Kay Knepprath, co-director of the California Homeless 
Coalition. "Many task forces around the state will include a few homeless or 
formerly homeless, but they have not had a real voice to speak out and say what 
it is they need." 
</P>
<P>
Using the slogan "You Count Me, I Count You," homeless advocates said they hope 
the voter registration campaign will remove fears among some homeless people 
that they will somehow be exploited by the census and draw more of them into 
shelters and other social service agencies during the count, scheduled for 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates also reason that a voter-registration drive will give a 
feeling of greater political clout to those who believe that politicians have 
paid only lip service to the issues of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"They are citizens, people who are being affected by policy decisions and they 
need to be represented as voters," said Susan Oakson of the Orange County 
Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates generally cite a 1985 court decision as establishing the 
basis for voting rights of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The case started when a group of homeless residents in Santa Barbara sought to 
register by using the street address of the park where they slept. The 
California Court of Appeal ultimately ruled that state election laws allow the 
homeless to use as a residence any place they normally sleep, such as parks, 
shelters or street corners. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless residents are required, however, to list a mailing address where they 
can receive voting materials and many shelters and charitable agencies have 
agreed to lend use of their own addresses for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The California Homeless Coalition, the largest group of its kind in the state, 
has sent mailers to nearly 400 shelters statewide, enlisting their aid in 
providing voter-registration materials. Of the 25 permanent shelters in Orange 
County, several have already indicated that they will participate. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, more than 100 people, including a group of nuns and high school 
students, have volunteered to assist in the voter-registration drive, said Toni 
Reinis, a local homeless advocate. In addition, the Los Angeles County 
registrar of voters has promised to provide at least one staff person to handle 
the processing of voter-registration forms, Reinis added. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County and elsewhere in the state, the League of Women Voters and 
other local civic groups have offered to send teams to some of the shelters to 
assist in filling out forms. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Census will be the first to try to quantify the problem of 
homelessness, even though census officials concede that it would be impossible 
to count every homeless person. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many homeless advocates, including Washington-based Mitch Snyder, 
are burning census forms and urging others to boycott the count, arguing that 
the data will be used to minimize the homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
Some California activists said they will not cooperate in the registration 
drive because it is linked to the census. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (homeless advocates) are using registration as an appeasement factor, but 
they are buying into a trap," said Paul Boden, a coordinator with the San 
Francisco Homeless Coalition. "You can register people to vote any time you 
want to do it; to tie voting and the census together is unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where estimates of the number of homeless range from 4,000 to 
10,000, advocates said they believe it will be particularly difficult to come 
up with an accurate census count because of the "invisibility" of much of the 
county's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
A recent demographic survey of nearly 2,000 homeless residents revealed that 
roughly 40% said they spent the previous night in their car or a motel, places 
that are unlikely to be tapped by census-takers. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, local homeless advocates say something like a 
voter-registration drive is needed to draw the homeless to shelters and other 
places where they are more likely to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeless here are not as concentrated as in other parts of the state or 
country, but in terms of services being provided, we know they are there," 
Oakson said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to shelters, the Orangethorpe United Methodist Church in Fullerton 
and St. John's Lutheran Church in Orange will also provide voter-registration 
assistance for homeless people.

MALATHION PROTESTERS SWARM AROUND GOVERNOR;

MEDFLY: NO ONE IS ARRESTED AS 70 DEMONSTRATORS SHOUT ANTI-PESTICIDE SLOGANS 
OUTSIDE HIS SPEECH AT THE DISNEYLAND HOTEL.

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian came to the Disneyland Hotel here Thursday to talk 
tourism, but it was his Mediterranean fruit fly campaign that drew the anger of 
about 70 demonstrators who marched on the hotel and left only under threat of 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In the most dramatic Orange County demonstration to date on Medfly spraying, a 
group of malathion critics swarmed around the governor's car outside the hotel 
and shouted anti-pesticide chants. No one was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big success," Garden Grove resident Mollie Haines, a protest 
organizer, said as demonstrators left the hotel grounds after being warned that 
they would be arrested. "We saw the Duke. He saw our protest, and he knows how 
mad we are. . . . He knows he and his spraying are not welcome here." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who has steadfastly asserted the safety of malathion and the 
necessity of aerial sprayings, largely avoided the issue and instead used his 
hotel speech before tourism industry leaders to support a gas tax increase 
proposed on the June 5 statewide ballot, which would pay for traffic 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The one reference he made to the Medfly came at the expense of his predecessor, 
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., who saw his own political career damaged by 
the Medfly issue in 1981 but has come back as head of the state Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, before his appearance at the annual tourism conference, quipped at 
a fund-raiser for Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier): "Shortly after Jerry 
Brown surfaced, well, you know the Medfly reappeared." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Deukmejian's willingness to move ahead with spraying this time 
around in Southern California that made him the target of county residents at 
the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Duke's a Hazard," read one of the several dozen signs, pointing up 
assertions by protesters that malathion spraying may pose a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration began calmly at 5:30 p.m. as about 110 local residents 
gathered on the sidewalk just outside the northwest corner of the hotel parking 
lot, waving signs, chanting and drawing honks from the street. 
</P>
<P>
But word soon spread in the crowd about a more radical approach, as about 70 
protesters surrounded the arriving limousines and tried to find Deukmejian's 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to make gestures, but we've got (Deukmejian) here in person, and 
we've got to do something to let him know how adamant we are," Long Beach 
resident Alan Seaman said. 
</P>
<P>
Russian comedian Yakov Smirnoff, appearing at the governor's dinner, was one of 
those whose limousines were surrounded by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't exactly know what it was all about, but that certainly made my 
entrance memorable," Smirnoff said later. " 'No more spraying!' I have that 
down now; it sounds like a new song." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the protesters marched around security guards to the entrance of 
the hotel, drawing stares and some angry comments from hotel guests. But 
another group saw a helicopter landing across from the hotel, ran to try to 
meet it and ended up swarming around Deukmejian's car as he made his way to the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I got right in his face," said one woman, who bragged to her fellow protesters 
later that she had been right next to Deukmejian's closed window.

POSTSCRIPT: 'PORTERVILLE' FIGURE STILL DOES IT HIS WAY

TRABUCO CANYON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago embattled contractor Sam Porter had his wagons drawn and was hurling 
well-aimed verbal potshots at county building inspectors, fellow board members 
of the Trabuco Canyon Water District, mega-developer William Lyon and anyone 
else who sought to meddle with his unconventional ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"People have described me as cantankerous and difficult, but I'm like Jim Bowie 
at the Alamo, I never run away," he said in an interview then. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more "difficult" of his ideas was embodied by "Porterville," an 
enclave of ramshackle huts, boxcars and abandoned buses that came to be 
occupied by several homeless and low-income working families on Porter's 
280-acre Trabuco Highlands ranch. 
</P>
<P>
County health and fire officials said the structures did not meet building 
codes and ordered the settlement closed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Porter was accused by his water board colleagues of illegally 
hooking several of the structures in Porterville to a single water meter. They 
sued him over it, and it came to be known as the Trabuco Water Wars. 
</P>
<P>
There was also the matter of Porter's long-running dispute with developer Lyon, 
who is building upscale homes on a ridge overlooking Porter's ranch. Porter 
claimed that the Lyon Co. reneged on a promise to build a road to his 
hard-to-reach hilltop home -- a promise made, according to Porter, in return 
for his dismantling the unsightly shantytown. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Porter was threatening to thumb his nose at everyone by building 
a settlement of Quonset huts for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Porter is still feuding with many of his neighbors, and he remains 
as voluble, controversial and colorful as ever. 
</P>
<P>
He finally agreed (albeit under court order) to settle his differences with the 
water district and has disconnected the disputed water lines. A "spirit of 
amicability has settled over the board," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Porterville not only still stands but has increased its population 
(about 85 families), even though Porter says he is trying to comply with county 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a slow process; they have nowhere else to go," he said. "There are a 
myriad of problems, but I have promised that they are moving." 
</P>
<P>
Porter, 62 and originally from Ogden, Utah, found his way to El Toro nearly 40 
years ago and, as a cement contractor, literally laid the foundation of cities 
like Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
He was elected to his water board seat in 1985 as a maverick "out to shake 
things up." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he ran an unsuccessful campaign for a seat on the Board of Supervisors 
against incumbent Gaddi H. Vasquez. He remains a vocal critic of local 
government and, in particular, its handling of development in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The Lyon Co., which he refers to as a "powerful enemy" and in other more 
colorful terms, has come in for much of Porter's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the "road deal," Porter alleges that company officials refused to 
provide him access to water lines located on property owned by the company. As 
a result, Porter says his family had to move out of its home for more than two 
months last summer because there was not enough water pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"What he wanted from us was to hook into the water lines that the company is 
building for its developments in the Trabuco Canyon area," said Lyon Co. 
spokesman Rick Sherman. "We offered to sell an easement for a nominal sum 
($15,000), and he refused to pay it." 
</P>
<P>
As for the "road deal," Sherman said the company did in fact grade a dirt road 
onto Porter's property. "We categorically deny that Lyon has in any way reneged 
on any agreement with Mr. Porter," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The sniping between Porter and the Lyon Co. is not likely to abate any time 
soon. The company won a judgment against Porter in Superior Court ordering him 
not to trespass and has filed another suit alleging that Porter defamed and 
libeled William Lyon on a series of banners and picket signs displayed 
prominently around Lyon developments. 
</P>
<P>
It has been, said Porter, a "tremendous year." But he harbors no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had not had to do some of the things I've done, but I would never 
back down," said the man given to comparing himself to Stonewall Jackson and 
Leonidas. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Porter is busy developing plans that will keep him occupied for at 
least another year, he says. 
</P>
<P>
He is preparing a campaign-reform measure for the supervisors that would 
include a provision establishing citizen review committees in each district. In 
what he concedes is a novel approach, developers would be required to match 
political contributions with contributions to the citizen committees.

RILEY, BREA OFFICIAL URGE USE OF COUNTY FUNDS TO EXPEDITE ROAD PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With state and federal money for highway projects drying up, two Orange County 
Transportation Commission members recommended Thursday that authorities dip 
into county funds to add new freeway lanes, help ease the financial crunch on 
three proposed toll roads and speed property acquisition for the Santa Ana 
Freeway widening. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and Brea Councilwoman Clarice A. Blamer said in the 
draft of a letter to be sent to county transportation officials that the county 
needs "to put every transportation dollar to work as soon and as effectively as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
"This illustrates our difficult financial situation," said Stanley T. Oftelie, 
executive director of the County Transportation Commission. "We're going to be 
spending the last resources we have. It's not going to be too long before the 
cupboard is bare. There's just no money left." 
</P>
<P>
Money for the projects would come from a cache of about $195 million that had 
been earmarked mostly for construction of a planned elevated transit-way for 
buses and car pools along the Santa Ana Freeway. In exchange, the state 
Department of Transportation could reimburse the county or provide credit for 
the construction of other projects, Riley and Blamer suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the county funds had been left untouched, although the interest has 
generated more than $21 million in road-reconstruction work and traffic-signal 
coordination projects in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to invest our resources in traffic solutions which provide 
high-impact, high-priority projects," Riley and Blamer said in the letter. "The 
transportation future for our county is now. Our ability to wait for a better 
future has been stretched to the limit. . . . We need to act swiftly or we may 
be engulfed in traffic congestion." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations from Riley and Blamer, who could not be reached for comment 
Thursday, come as a precursor to a March 26 meeting of the Transportation 
Commission and the Orange County Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
Among projects spotlighted by Riley and Blamer are the proposed addition of two 
car-pool lanes on the Orange Freeway later this year and widening of the 
traffic-choked Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they recommend that county transportation officials explore 
offering loans to the agency planning the three toll roads in southern and 
eastern Orange County. The agency has experienced recent financial 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Riley and Blamer also proposed that county transportation officials work with 
the state transportation department to accelerate the purchase of land along 
the Santa Ana Freeway for a widening project that will more than double the 
number of lanes. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, a personnel shortage at Caltrans has hindered the agency in 
expeditiously purchasing land along the freeway corridor, the two officials 
said in the letter. Moreover, authorities say that state cash for property 
acquisition will dwindle if a gas-tax increase is not approved by California 
voters in June. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the agencies should work cooperatively to develop innovative ways 
to keep the right-of-way purchase process moving ahead rapidly," the letter 
says, adding that county money should be used to hire additional Caltrans staff 
and buy land. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are eager to buy the land as soon as possible, reasoning that 
its cost will only continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
If money was available, work on the Orange Freeway car-pool lanes, which are 
expected to cost $26 million, could begin before the end of the year.

MCKNIGHT INJURES BACK, BUT WON'T MISS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mater Dei High School basketball Coach Gary McKnight is suffering from severe 
muscle spasms in his back, but he said Thursday he would not miss his team's 
state championship game against San Francisco Riordan Saturday night in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight injured his back lifting a bag of baseball equipment after his son's 
Little League game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Assistants Dave Taylor and Phil Bellomo have conducted practices this week in 
McKnight's absence, but McKnight said he plans to go to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never miss the game, even if they have to prop me up," he said.

LADY CATS ARE MAKING HISTORY IN COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
BREA-OLINDA: TEAM, WHICH PLAYS FOR STATE DIVISION III GIRLS' TITLE SATURDAY, IS 
CONSIDERED AMONG SOUTHERN SECTION'S ALL-TIME BEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Just how good is the Brea-Olinda High School girls' basketball team? -- The 
Lady Cats are the first Orange County girls' basketball team to win a state 
championship, which they did last season. They have a chance to make it 
back-to-back titles with a victory in State Division III title game against 
Auburn Placer Saturday morning at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They are 33-0 and working on a 55-game winning streak, second in Southern 
Section history to the 84-game streak set by Riverside Poly teams from 1978-82, 
led by Cheryl Miller. Brea-Olinda last lost to Cony, Me., at the Christ the 
King Tournament in New York in December 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They earned a No. 4 ranking in USA Today after toppling then-top-ranked 
Morningside and its all-American, Lisa Leslie, and then-sixth-ranked Los 
Angeles Washington on the way to the championship of the Santa Barbara 
Tournament of Champions in December. 
</P>
<P>
On March 8, as the team warmed up for its game against Lemoore in the Southern 
California Regional Division III semifinal, Lady Cat fans not only were buying 
tickets at the gym for the regional championship game at the Sports Arena, but 
several already had made plane and hotel reservations for the state tournament 
in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Cockiness on the part of the fans? Maybe. More likely it is testimony to the 
strength of this year's Lady Cat team. The team has carved out a place in 
Orange County history, and it is making its mark on Southern Section history as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
They have emerged, along with Dave White's 1987 Edison team, as one of the best 
to come out of Orange County. The Edison team won the Southern Section 4-A 
title and finished 31-2 after a loss in the Southern California regional final. 
It featured three players who won college scholarships: 4-A player of the year 
Kristy Smith (Utah), Michelle Hennessey (Utah) and Denise Ogburn (Cal Poly 
Pomona). 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a heck of a game," White said, speculating about a 1990 Brea-1987 
Edison matchup. "It would be up-tempo because both teams like to press and run. 
We both feel each of our two guards were probably the two best guard tandems 
that have come through in a long time, so it would be a great matchup." 
</P>
<P>
Brea Coach Mark Trakh agrees that either team could win. "My heart says 
Brea-Olinda first, my mind says it would be a really tough game," Trakh said. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how good this season's Lady Cats are, most coaches say they couldn't 
have handled Riverside Poly during the Cheryl Miller years, specifically the 
1981 team in her junior year, considered the best girls' basketball team in 
Southern Section history. And a strong case could be made for Miller's 1982 
team that won the state Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (Brea) have a great team," said Len Locher, who runs a West Coast 
scouting service and the Tournament of Champions, a showcase for some of the 
best teams on the West Coast. "It is the best team probably to ever come out of 
Orange County. They would probably be in the top six, maybe five in Southern 
Section history. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't have beaten the Riverside Poly team of 1982. I don't think we'll 
ever see another team like that one at any level. Not only did they have the 
best player in probably the game's history at the high school level, but five 
Division I athletes with her. They could have played with a lot of college 
teams during that period." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Poly's starting lineup included Miller, who went on to become a 
four-time all-American at USC and an Olympian, and Meg Gallagher, who played at 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Locher ranks four other teams ahead of this year's Brea-Olinda team: 1988 
Morningside, 1987 Santa Barbara, 1984 Buena and 1979 Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is the Lady Cats don't have the dominating center. Sophomore center 
Jinelle Williams averages 15 points and nine rebounds a game, but she is only 
5-foot-9. Aimee McDaniel (5-6) runs the point. Tammy Blackburn (5-8) is the 
shooting guard, and Jody Anton (5-11) and Allison Bickel (6-0) are the 
forwards. 
</P>
<P>
The teams Brea has beaten this season have had weaknesses either in the post or 
with their supporting casts. 
</P>
<P>
Against Palos Verdes, in the Southern California Division III regional finals, 
the Lady Cats struggled in the first half with 6-2 Monique Moorehouse, who is 
not a dominating center. Brea-Olinda eventually won, 47-46. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't match up well with a lot of teams," Locher said. "These teams ahead 
of them had big kids with no weaknesses to exploit. The centers were all strong 
and had strong supporting casts. 
</P>
<P>
"Brea just doesn't have the monster on the front line and that is really what 
the difference is," Locher said. "Not to take anything away from Williams and 
Bickel and Anton -- they are very solid players -- but they don't have that big 
6-2 kid who can really do it." What Brea-Olinda does have is an incredible team 
fidelity and an almost merciless ability to exploit a team's weaknesses while 
making few mistakes itself. 
</P>
<P>
"They take advantage of your weaknesses," Morningside Coach Frank Scott said. 
When Brea-Olinda knocked his team from the No. 1 spot in the nation this 
season, two of Morningside's starters were injured. Scott would like another 
shot at Brea-Olinda, but he has his hands full in the state Division I 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing Brea-Olinda has is the state Division III player of the year -- 
McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart and soul of the team is McDaniel," Scott said. "Without her, I don't 
know how far they would have gone. It would be like us losing Lisa (Leslie). 
She is not the caliber of player Lisa is, but I think she is their best 
player." 
</P>
<P>
It was McDaniel who made a promise to Coach Trakh that things would get better. 
That was two years ago, after Brea-Olinda experienced one of its biggest upset 
losses, falling to Los Altos, 46-41, in the Southern Section quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda had what many considered its best team, a team that had a good 
chance to compete for the state Division II title two years ago. Blackburn, 
McDaniel and Bickel were sophomores, and Kristen Blair and Susan Tousey were 
the other starters. Tousey was the dominating center. "She was a 6-3 senior who 
could touch the rim," Trakh said. "The kid had super talent. She had a hook 
shot you couldn't believe. She could run, shoot. There was nothing she couldn't 
do." But the Lady Cats didn't meet expectations. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of trouble that comes to many successful teams. A little envy, 
here and a little jealousy there may have resulted in the upset loss. 
</P>
<P>
Trakh blames himself for not educating the players to accept their roles and 
put the team ahead of individual goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so disappointed with the immaturity of the kids, I said I'm done," Trakh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was McDaniel, says Trakh, who made a commitment after that game that 
changed Trakh's mind. "It was one of the most motivating moments in my life 
when this kid came up to me and said, 'Hey, I'm sorry. I screwed up for you and 
if you stay, I'm going to work for you.' That was the turning point," Trakh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She still gets upset with me and everything, but the bottom line was she was 
really loyal when it counted. She just said this won't happen again. And in two 
years, it hasn't."

MONARCHS: BENCH PLAYERS USUALLY SHOW THEIR STRENGTH IN PRACTICE. THAT'S WHEN

<P>
They call themselves "The Scrubs." Not only are they one of the best prep 
basketball teams you'll seldom see, they're the only team to consistently beat 
Mater Dei all season. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei is the state's top-ranked high school team with a 33-1 record going 
into the State Division I boys' championship game Saturday in Oakland. The 
Monarchs have won 25 consecutive games, including a victory over Loyola for the 
Southern Section's 5-A title and over Long Beach Poly for the Southern 
California Division I regional championship. 
</P>
<P>
But in the daily practices with only coaches and team managers in attendance, 
the reserves are often the stars for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
"They're better than half the teams we've played this season," starting forward 
Charlie Andres said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them could be starting at other schools," Mater Dei Coach Gary 
McKnight said. "They've been pushed to the limit just to survive here, but they 
have a ring on their finger and a smile on their face." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's reserves are underclassmen projected as starters who are awaiting 
their turn, seniors who are borderline starters but had an impact on 
lower-level teams or seniors who rarely play but just want to be part of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Junior center Mark Moneypenny, junior forward Taylor Ivey and sophomore guard 
Reggie Geary are considered the cornerstones of next season's team. 
</P>
<P>
Senior point guard Glen Malone and senior off-guard Paul Nolan would start at 
most schools, but find themselves playing behind returning starters Jason Quinn 
and David Boyle and sixth man Dan O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being reserves, Malone and Nolan have caught the attention of college 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast College Coach Tandy Gillis is interested in Malone. Nolan is being 
recruited by University of Redlands Coach Gary Smith. 
</P>
<P>
John O'Toole, senior class valedictorian with a 4.6 grade-point average, falls 
into the third class of reserve. He rarely plays, but enjoys being part of a 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
"I could be playing at other schools, but I wouldn't be playing now in March at 
another school," O'Toole said. "I'd rather not play and win than play and 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
The Scrubs, headed by O'Toole, emulate an opponent's offense in practice or 
provide depth and moral support from the bench on game nights. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan is the team's great impostor. Before Mater Dei played Capistrano Valley, 
Nolan was Scott McCorkle, the Cougars' high-scoring forward. He was Rob Johnson 
before Mater Dei met El Toro in the 5-A semifinals; John Molle before Mater Dei 
played Irvine in the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan, a senior, was projected as a starter during the summer, but he broke his 
finger last July in a tournament in Texas. Nolan recovered from that injury, 
then broke his ankle on the second day of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I never caught up," Nolan said. "If you fall behind here, there's somebody 
else just as good who's going to take your place." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan displayed Mater Dei's incredible depth when he got the opportunity to 
become the team's sixth man when O'Neil was on a football recruiting trip. He 
scored nine points, hitting three consecutive critical shots, in a 66-53 
victory over Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul showed how deep we are," O'Toole said. "We all have the confidence we can 
produce if given the opportunity. The practices get the starters and reserves 
ready for every game." 
</P>
<P>
Ivey anticipates that next season "will be my year" and has accepted his role 
as a reserve. He battles Andy Karich, the Angelus League's most valuable 
player, every day in practice. He is quick to point out that the final two 
minutes of a lopsided game is prime time for the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our chance to show the coaches, but at the same time, you don't want to 
be a ballhog, so you have to play within a team concept," Ivey said. "We 
usually get in the game in the final two minutes if we have a 14-point lead or 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Geary is the prime reason Mater Dei fans seldom leave a game before it's over. 
Geary's acrobatic dunks have helped him become the favorite of the Mater Dei 
student section. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the reason people stay for the whole game," O'Toole said. "Reggie is the 
pride of the Scrubs. We know some day he's going to be the star player at Mater 
Dei."

The Scrubs' excitement on the bench is often transmitted to the action on the 
floor. The players sometimes try to excite the student section that is headed 
by a former player, Brian Liberto. 
</P>
<P>
Liberto was a reserve for three years in Mater Dei's basketball program, but 
opted to become a rooter rather than a reserve in his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be a little subdued on the bench, and I found you can get out more 
aggression and have more fun sitting in the rooter section," Liberto said.

KARCHER NEARS DEAL TO PLACE CARL'S JR. IN 9 PACIFIC NATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises, the parent company of Carl's Jr., is negotiating a 
licensing agreement with a Malaysian finance company to expand the fast-food 
chain into nine Pacific Rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
An official for MBf International Ltd., a unit of MBf Group of Cos. -- a large 
financial-services firm based Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia -- confirmed Thursday that 
it is close to signing the agreement with Karcher, which could be announced as 
early as today. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the (Carl's Jr.) product is good, and we're enjoying a growing 
economy," said Soopeng Khoo, executive vice president for MBf Group, when 
contacted at his office in Kuala Lumpur. "People are getting more affluent. 
They travel a lot and get used to eating food that does not originate from this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Khoo said top MBf executives are in the United States and met with Karcher 
officials Thursday. Top Karcher officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would mark the second major Karcher deal in the Far East. In 1988, 
Karcher signed an agreement with a Japanese firm to open 30 Carl's Jr. outlets 
in Japan. Two are operating there now, with three more scheduled to open this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The move places Karcher, with its Carl's Jr. chain, among the major U.S. 
fast-food operators trying to stake a large claim in the growing international 
fast-food market. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed agreement with MBf, the first Carl's Jr. restaurant would 
open in Malaysia early next year, followed by other outlets in Singapore, 
Australia and Hong Kong. Other target countries would be Indonesia, the 
Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The exact terms of the deal could not be determined. But analysts said it will 
probably involve forming a joint venture, with MBf providing most of the 
financing and Karcher providing management and training. MBf already has a 
licensing agreement with another U.S. restaurant chain, Dallas-based Grandy's. 
</P>
<P>
"A joint venture is the only way to go," said Sarah Stack, an analyst for 
Bateman Eichler Hill Richards in Los Angeles. "You need to have a national 
partner to help navigate the cultural differences." 
</P>
<P>
While details could not be determined Thursday, the basic outline of the 
agreement was confirmed this week by industry analysts and sources familiar 
with Karcher's operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a no-lose situation," said James J. Murren, an analyst for C.J. Lawrence 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Karcher will probably take MBf as a joint-venture partner, lending 
market support and ideas with a limited cash investment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity to get the (Carl's Jr.) name out with no significant 
capital expenses," he said. The deal "is very modest, and it's a revenue 
producer that's pretty much risk free." 
</P>
<P>
While lauded as turning out some of the highest-quality fast food in the 
industry, Carl's Jr. has had only modest success outside California, where it 
has become a fast-food institution since the first Carl's Jr. restaurant was 
founded in the mid-1950s. Now there are about 550 company- or franchise-owned 
Carl's Jr. outlets in California, Arizona, Nevada and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Anton Brenner of Altman, Brenner, Wasserman &amp; Co. in New York said Asian 
markets certainly are not as saturated as the United States is with fast-food 
hamburger outlets. He said Carl's Jr. has differentiated itself enough from 
McDonald's that it can succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly smart to be expanding internationally," Brenner said. "Those 
restaurant companies that show the most rapid growth are those that have a more 
global approach." 
</P>
<P>
Stack of Bateman Eichler Hill Richards agreed that there is plenty of room for 
fast-food development in the Far East: "Carl's Jr. will be perceived as the 
quality alternative to McDonald's, just as they are in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
She said the move into the Far East will not have a "significant" near-term 
impact on Karcher's earnings and revenue. The company reported a 13% decline in 
earnings and an 18% increase in revenue for first nine months of fiscal 1990, 
ending Nov. 6. Company officials attributed the drop in earnings to discounting 
by competitors.

AT&amp;T May Broaden Early Retirement Plan: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, 
continuing its campaign to cut costs, said that it is talking to its two major 
unions about an early-retirement program that for the first time would be 
offered to non-management employees. Interest in a new early-retirement plan 
aimed at non-management levels surfaced last year, a spokesman said, after 
about 12,500 managers -- 37% of those eligible accepted the incentive package. 
Stinson did not disclose how many of the company's 165,000 non-management 
employees might be affected nor when an early-retirement plan might be offered.

S&amp;L CHIEF DIRECTED FRAUD, MCKINZIE JURY TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: DR. DUAYNE CHRISTENSEN MASTERMINDED THE SCHEME TO LOOT NORTH AMERICA 
SAVINGS, USING JANET FAYE MCKINZIE ONLY AS A DRUGGED TOOL, HER LAWYER SAID.

The dead man did it. 
</P>
<P>
So concluded defense attorney Richard (Racehorse) Haynes during closing 
arguments Thursday in the seven-week trial of Janet Faye McKinzie, who is 
accused of looting North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana with the help 
of the thrift's president, Duayne D. Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes told jurors in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana that Christensen -- a 
former dentist who died in a mysterious car crash just 9 1/2 hours before 
regulators seized the institution -- was the mastermind of a plot to steal tens 
of millions of dollars from North America. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen and McKinzie lived lavishly, spending freely on everything from 
extravagant parties with Sammy Davis Jr. as entertainment to trinkets such as a 
$500 gold paper clip. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Paul Seave portrayed the couple in his closing arguments 
as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, working together to carry out complicated 
schemes to defraud the thrift. The jury is expected to begin deliberations 
today. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to 26 counts of 
racketeering, bank fraud, wire fraud and interstate transportation of stolen 
property. If convicted, she faces a sentence of more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Haynes characterized McKinzie as "a washed-out zombie" simply taking orders 
from Christensen, who was allegedly plying her with massive doses of 
prescription drugs, including anti-anxiety medications such as Xanax. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes, one of the nation's leading defense attorneys, called Christensen the 
Jim Jones of the savings and loan industry, a reference to the cult religious 
figure who led more than 900 followers in a mass suicide in Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen "was able to make people believe things that weren't true," Haynes 
contended. "He could make them put the cyanide in the Kool-Aid. That was Dr. 
Christensen." 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Seave balked at the notion that North America's 1987 collapse 
was only Christensen's doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is Dr. Christensen was a crook," Seave said, "and the 
defendant was his right-hand man." 
</P>
<P>
He told jurors that McKinzie was completely aware of what she was doing, taking 
the lead in two schemes to defraud North America of more than $16 million. He 
produced document after document that the prosecution has said were falsified 
at McKinzie's instruction to cover up the schemes. 
</P>
<P>
"For her counsel to suggest she was insane at the time," Seave said, "is 
preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors showed jurors a memo allegedly from McKinzie that 
supposedly ordered the forging of some bank documents. 
</P>
<P>
"Put in sealed envelopes so it looks professional and I'll open. Be sure to 
sign good," McKinzie allegedly wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this sound like someone who has a bad memory, is confused, intoxicated, 
acting like a robot?" Seave asked jurors. "Dr. Christensen was not there, 
behind her, moving her arms, moving her lips. . . . The evidence is 
overwhelming (that) the defendant knew exactly what she was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes appealed to the jury to acquit McKinzie. "Take the manipulative hands 
(of Christensen) off the body and soul of this woman and let her go home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The North America trial represents the government's first use of RICO (the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) against a failed S&amp;L on 
the West Coast. RICO was used so that the government could freeze the proceeds 
from a $10-million life insurance policy that Christensen had bought for 
McKinzie. 
</P>
<P>
North America was shut down in 1988, costing taxpayers $120 million.

OTHERS GET INTO THE ACT IN SOME CUSTODY BATTLES;

Custody is often the most emotional issue in divorce cases involving children. 
There are, however, other issues related to child custody that only five years 
ago were unheard-of in court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
These are the emerging trends that promise to test the Best Interests Standard, 
the judicial guide by which all custody cases are determined, and perhaps set 
new standards in the increasingly complicated aspects of child custody. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the new custody issues, according to Judge Stanley Novack, who hears 
custody cases at Superior Court in Stamford, Conn., include grandparents' 
rights, surrogate parents, unmarried parents, homosexual parents and frozen 
embryos. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a whole brand new field in this branch of law," Novack said. "And it 
raises all kinds of philosophical questions. For example, can a prostitute be a 
good mother? The answer could be yes, depending on her relationship with her 
child." 
</P>
<P>
In determining the answer, said Novack, a judge must "reach back into the same 
old law" and go by the Best Interests Standard. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to consider the impact on a child," he said. "That's the $64 
question. It doesn't automatically rule out a parent who has, say, a homosexual 
relationship with another person, or who is living with a member of the 
opposite sex who isn't the other parent, but these kinds of things are 
certainly factors to be considered." 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, very few precedents for certain cases. One is the so-called 
"Baby M Case," in which a surrogate mother decided she wanted to keep the child 
she had contracted to bear for a young professional couple that could not have 
children of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The case drew national attention and ended when a judge ruled in 1988 that the 
adoptive parents should have custody and the surrogate mother should have only 
visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
"That case was new," Novack said. "Cases involving sperm donors are new. There 
are now cases involving arrangements made between unmarried couples who have 
children. And, of course, the whole issue of parental rights in frozen-embryo 
cases is new," he added, referring to the case in Tennessee last year in which 
a judge in a divorce case gave custody of seven frozen embryos to the woman 
whose husband had fertilized them.

CHILD'S 'BEST INTERESTS' GUIDE JUDGES' DECISIONS; 
</P>

ONE THAT HAS EVOLVED GREATLY IN THE PAST 40 YEARS.

Children often find themselves in the middle of a tug of war when their parents 
get divorced. 
</P>
<P>
The scene is played out thousands of times a year in courtrooms across the 
country: A man and a woman realize that their crumbling marriage cannot be 
saved, so one or each of them files for divorce. If they have children, custody 
becomes an issue. And when both parents want custody, the result is often an 
emotional battle in which their kids are caught in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks he or she is acting in the best interests of the child," said 
Dr. Stephen P. Herman, a child and adolescent psychiatrist with a practice in 
Connecticut and New York. "But unfortunately, that's not always the case." 
</P>
<P>
Acting in a child's best interests is a legal requirement in child-custody 
cases. Moreover, it is being used as a guide to address emerging trends such as 
surrogate parents, unmarried parents, homosexual couples, frozen embryos and 
grandparents' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Determining a child's best interests is a delicate and frequently complicated 
procedure in which lawyers, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers all 
make recommendations that are considered by a judge before he or she makes a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of these experts are made after extensive interviews or 
counseling sessions with the parents and, usually separately, their children. 
Mental health experts are frequently called upon to testify for one side or the 
other, but sometimes the court will appoint its own expert to ensure impartial 
testimony. After weighing all the factors in a custody case, the judge will 
make a decision based on the Best Interests Standard, which has become the 
guide by which custody cases are decided. 
</P>
<P>
The Best Interests Standard, which Herman called "the guiding presumption of 
the courts today," has been in use for about 40 years and differs significantly 
from previous standards, in which the sex of the parent was the determining 
factor in almost all such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of civilization, children were considered the 'property' of the 
father," Herman said. "This was laid down by Roman law and continued through 
the Renaissance until the last part of the 19th Century." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, children were no longer considered property; instead, they were 
viewed as "little people" who would be better cared for by their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Mothers were then seen as the so-called 'better-fit' parents," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
That led to the adoption of the Tender Years Doctrine, a legal standard that 
almost always gave custody of young children to their mothers. After the 
children turned 7, however, they were often returned to their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"This really could have been very disruptive," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
For this and other reasons, notably the constitutional guarantee of equal 
protection under the law, the Best Interests Standard was established just 
after World War II and has since become what Herman called "the major trend 
that forms judicial opinion" in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
Although judges are guided by this standard, Herman added, "there is, in fact, 
a strong feeling among judges that mothers are better parents, especially of 
younger kids." 
</P>
<P>
This, he said, is borne out by the fact that in most cases, the mother gets 
custody of the children. Although there is no one organization or agency that 
compiles nationwide custody statistics, according to Herman and other 
professionals interviewed for this story, they all said that mothers get 
custody in the vast majority of uncontested cases, perhaps as much as 90% of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Stanley Novack, who has heard child-custody cases at Superior Court in 
Stamford, Conn., for the past 15 years, disagrees with Herman, saying that 
while mothers often get custody of their children, it is not because judges 
think they are better parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It does work out in many cases that the mother gets the child," Novack said. 
"But that is based on relationship. One of the factors to consider is, who is 
the psychological parent? To which parent is the child bonded? In many cases 
the child is bonded to his or her mother because he or she is with the mother 
most of the day. In that case the woman may get custody, but not simply because 
she is the mother." 
</P>
<P>
Novack also points out that since the institution of the Best Interests 
Standard, a greater number of fathers are winning custody. And he agrees with 
Herman that while mothers are still more likely to get custody, fathers win "a 
large percentage" of contested cases. 
</P>

"Women win a large number of custody cases that are uncontested," Herman said. 
"But when fathers decide to fight it, they win a good deal of the time. I'd say 
about 50%." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult decision a judge has to make in a custody case is 
whether to give one parent sole custody or to award joint custody. Novack says 
that there are two kinds of joint custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Joint legal custody is when both parents share the decision-making about their 
child or children," he said. "Joint physical custody is when both parents share 
blocks of time with their children." 
</P>
<P>
Joint legal custody is common in situations where the children of a divorced 
couple live primarily with one parent, even though the other parent may have 
visitation rights or has been allowed to take the children for weekends, 
vacations or holidays.

BETTY LAMPS NOW CAST IN A GOOD LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Betty lamp came over to American on the Mayflower, was improved upon by 
Benjamin Franklin and today is prized by collectors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1620, according to an article in the current issue of Country Living, it was 
at the forefront of lighting technology. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty was a small, open iron lamp whose name was taken from the German word 
besser, meaning "better." It was a big improvement over its predecessor -- a 
hollow stone or shell with a bit of twisted moss for a wick and animal fat for 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty lamp consisted of a small, shallow bowl. At one end the lip of the 
bowl was shaped like a spout, holding a piece of rag or cotton that formed a 
wick. The other end of the wick lay submerged in a pool of fish oil. 
</P>
<P>
The lamp was smelly, smoky, burned unevenly, dripped hot oil and tipped over 
easily, yet it served the colonists for another 150 years. The discovery of tin 
in England made the lamps lighter, less expensive and led to some superficial 
style changes, but they remained dim, smoky and smelly. 
</P>
<P>
The first major change saw the wick enclosed in a tight-fitting circular tube, 
concentrating the flame and increasing the amount of light produced. 
</P>
<P>
The next advance came when the thriving New England whaling industry led to the 
discovery that refined whale oil produced a brighter, cleaner flame. 
</P>
<P>
Candles in those days were a luxury used only for special occasions. Oxen, 
whose fat made good candles, were too scarce to be used for food rather than 
farming. Bear and deer fat, beeswax and whale blubber all proved 
unsatisfactory. Hog's lard candles were smoky and foul-smelling. 
</P>
<P>
In the 18th Century, Ben Franklin made the next big improvement. Franklin, who 
as a child had worked in his father's tallow shop, devised the double wick, 
which increased the lamp's light and heat and enabled it to burn off the carbon 
that previously had accumulated on Betty lamp wicks. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 years later an unknown designer created a dual-wick lamp for Noah 
Webster with an added improvement -- a circular reflector. Webster's lamp 
burned lard oil, a popular fuel by 1850, and provided him with the light 
required to work on his dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
Both whale oil and refined lard oil became obsolete after 1880 when the 
discovery of underground oil in Pennsylvania led to the full-scale production 
of cleaner, safer kerosene. 
</P>
<P>
The development of pewter encouraged lamp makers to experiment with a variety 
of shapes and styles -- one reason why identical, authentic Betty lamps are 
seldom found. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors should know that lamps designed to burn whale oil used narrow wicks, 
while those that burned lard oil had wider wicks. Betty lamps hammered from a 
single sheet of iron are apt to be older than tin or pewter varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many lamp styles that pewter made possible was the tavern lamp with a 
handle, wide base for stability and totally enclosed fuel tank for safety. 
</P>
<P>
These acquired the nickname "sparking lamps" because when the small fuel tank 
became empty, it was time for a gentleman caller to leave. The lamp's dying 
flame signaled a suitor's departure -- or maybe even an opportunity to steal a 
good-night kiss in the dark.

WINEGROWERS PONDER WAYS TO PLUG THE RISING COST OF PORTUGUESE CORKS; 
</P>
<P>
PACKAGING: WITH THE COST OF THE BOTTLE STOPPERS INCREASING, THE INDUSTRY SEEKS 
ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS SHORTER CORKS OR PLASTIC.

<P>
Wine drinkers could find a shortened cork or even a plastic stopper in the neck 
of their favorite bottle of Bordeaux if cork costs continue to climb, French 
wine growers say. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the standard two-inch cork is rising by 10% to 15% a year because 
Portuguese suppliers, having driven French competitors from the market, are now 
in a monopoly position, some growers complain. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of a cork stopper is becoming truly prohibitive," said Joel Buisson, 
who produces a modest "vin de pays" in southwest France. 
</P>
<P>
At close to two francs (35 cents) each, today's corks now cost as much as a 
glass of the wine they help hold, Buisson said. In cheaper wines, selling for 
about 10 francs ($1.75) a bottle, the cork accounts for a fifth of the price. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wine growers such as Buisson, frustrated at having to pay what they regard as 
inflated prices for Portuguese cork, are now beginning to wonder. If 
champagne's reputation is not hurt by a one-inch cork, they ask, why can't 
they, too, "shorten" their costs. 
</P>
<P>
If this means putting a little more wine in the bottle to close the gap, then 
that is probably cheaper in the long run than paying for the bigger cork, they 
reckon. 
</P>
<P>
Fernand Barray of Barbaste, the former capital of French cork, claimed the 
industry he used to work in had been ruined by Portuguese dumping tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"All this is the fault of Portugal, which wrecked prices five or six years ago 
and destroyed French makers," he said in an interview. Portuguese cork 
producers also buy up bark from Spanish cork oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Others say, however, that making a scapegoat of the Portuguese would not hide 
past errors by the French themselves, who planted pine instead of cork oaks in 
the 1950s after forest fires ravaged the main source of domestic supply. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950 there were 48 cork producers in the southern Landes region. Today there 
are no more than five, according to Daniel Biraud of the Lot-et-Garonne Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor decision of the politicians of the period to encourage the planting 
of pine in burned-out areas ended up by reducing local production to less than 
3% of real needs," Biraud said. 
</P>
<P>
Growers said there was nothing in the law to regulate the length of the stopper 
or to insist that it be made of cork. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my friends won first prize for his rose wine, but nevertheless it's 
corked with plastic," said Buisson. 
</P>
<P>
He added that nothing could stop producers of the top quality grand cru wines 
from doing likewise if cost pressures continued to rise -- provided they were 
convinced that consumers would accept the move. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you've explained to the consumer that plastic, unlike cork, does not give 
a taste to the wine and that it costs significantly less, I'm afraid that cork, 
which is really only a snobbery, will be abandoned."

O.C.'S ONLY TALK-RADIO STATION TO GO ALL-MUSIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's only talk-radio station has laid off its morning team as it 
prepares for a planned switch to an all-music format. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Yvonne Turnbull, a husband-and-wife team who hosted a magazine-style 
show weekdays from 6 to 9 a.m., were let go after their show Wednesday at 
Anaheim-based KORG (1190 AM). On Thursday, their show was replaced by 
syndicated programming. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Turnbull said he and his wife were told that they were being let go to make 
way for a switch to an all-music format. While he called the parting "amiable," 
he expressed disappointment that the county would lose its only talk station. 
</P>
<P>
KORG's vice president and general manager, Bob Wood, said Thursday that the 
station is "looking at several options right now" but is leaning toward a 
format that aims to attract an audience 45 to 65 years old with a blend of big 
band and adult contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
The service would be provided by Unistar, a Colorado-based company that 
provides 24-hour programming in a variety of formats to more than 1,000 
stations nationwide, via satellite. Wood said that if KORG goes with the 
service, it would use only part of the satellite feed and would keep some 
locally produced programming. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get this format in this market, I think it would be an asset," Wood 
said. He stressed that no deals have been finalized and said no date for the 
switch has been set. Besides the Turnbulls, KORG's midday host Karen Tyndall 
was replaced last month with satellite programming, as was Ken Satin's 
afternoon show. Neither was a salaried station employee. 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-watt KORG has gone through several format changes in recent years. 
It last switched formats in February, 1989, from Christian programming (as 
station KPZE) to an all-talk lineup with an emphasis on Orange County. It also 
flirted with an all-news format as KNWZ after years as a Top 40 rock station, 
KEZY-AM. 
</P>
<P>
KORG and sister station KEZY-FM were purchased last year for $15.1 million by 
New York-based ML Media Partners. When former owners Anaheim Broadcasting Corp. 
agreed to sell in June, ML officials said there were no plans to change formats 
at either station. KEZY-FM is a Top 40 station.

CATERWAUL SHOW WASHES OUT MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Caterwaul makes music that thrives in the dark -- hypnotic, impressionistic 
waves of sound that can conjure some interesting dream images and nocturnal 
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to fathom why a band whose whole method is mystery would want to 
play a show with the house lights on, but that's what Caterwaul did Wednesday 
as it headlined the weekly Club Tangent alternative-rock night at the Marquee. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Caterwaul from under the glow of red-coated electric bulbs was like 
trick-or-treating at noon -- the light washed all the mystery out of the 
experience. Any images the songs and sounds might have conjured were expunged 
like snapshots in a popped-open camera. 
</P>
<P>
The only conceivable excuse for keeping a nightclub lit like a cafeteria might 
be a band's intention to turn a concert into a communal experience. But singer 
Betsy Martin made only tentative attempts to connect with a sparse audience of 
perhaps 100 people. Caterwaul's four members performed in self-contained 
fashion, wrapped in their own reveries, or perhaps in their own cocoons of 
boredom. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the Los Angeles band played badly. Guitarist Mark Schafer and 
bassist Fred Cross set up the basic moody soundscape -- Schafer with echoing 
sheets of distorted sound, and Cross with a steady thrum (the bassist played in 
a hunched-over position that would instill high hopes in the heart of any 
business-starved chiropractor). 
</P>
<P>
Martin had no trouble reproducing the strange, incantational singing that is 
the focus of Caterwaul's two albums, "Pin &amp; Web" and the newly released 
"Portent Hue." She has a rangy voice that can move with sure pitch and control 
from a cracked, cronelike husk to a disembodied Appalachian falsetto. On record 
it is evocative. In this uninspired concert it was merely unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Unusual, but not unique. Martin's tone recalls Marianne Faithfull's memorable 
wreck of a voice and the frayed, nervous charge in the singing of Throwing 
Muses' Kristin Hersh. Unlike Faithfull and Hersh, whose material fully supports 
their pained vocal contortions, it is sometimes hard to detect the reasons for 
Caterwaul's wailing. Martin's songs obviously are set at emotional extremes, 
but the lyrics offer few hints as to why. In concert, Martin's occasional 
dancer's whirls and tosses of a full blond mane of curls weren't enough to 
illuminate the cryptic codes in her music. 
</P>
<P>
It would have helped if Caterwaul, which originated in Phoenix, had 
concentrated on its best material. But, with the exception of one folk-style 
ballad and the charging set-closing rocker "Stumped," it stayed with more 
shapeless, mid-tempo mood pieces that devolved into sameness. Playing a stingy 
50-minute set, Caterwaul couldn't be bothered to play stronger numbers like 
"Manna and Quail," leaving it to the club disc jockey to toss that tune on 
after the show was over. 
</P>
<P>
The second-billed Pivot Foots are a local band whose album, "Wingless Birds of 
Flight" is full of intelligent, wryly written songs and enjoyable stylistic 
dabbling. But the Long Beach trio hasn't yet found its footing as a stage band. 
There are plenty of punch lines and comic observations in the songs written by 
brothers Brent and Blair Walker, but Blair's harsh, husky voice was blunt and 
straining when nuance and control would have served the songs better. To pull 
it off live, the Pivot Foots will have to establish more confident vocal and 
instrumental chops so they can concentrate freely on projecting the personality 
that abounds in their songs. 
</P>
<P>
Opening band Naked Soul showed some of the virtues and vices of the 
Replacements. The four-member band had a raw, edgy attack, and singer Mike 
Conley achieved an Angst-ridden emotionalism reminiscent of the Replacements' 
Paul Westerberg. Like the Replacements, Naked Soul also showed an inclination 
to indulge itself in sloppy, amateurish clowning. Unlike the Replacements, who 
have largely renounced those old ways, Naked Soul is totally unproven and can't 
afford to waste its listeners' time.

FUNDING: THE HEAD OF A GROUP SEEKING COUNTY BACKING FOR A NEW ARTS AGENCY SAYS 
THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES. BUT SUPERVISOR THOMAS F. RILEY ISN'T AS 
OPTIMISTIC. 
</P>

<P>
The head of a local committee that is seeking county backing for a proposed 
arts agency doesn't seem worried about a recent financial forecast indicating 
that Orange County government may face a budget deficit of up to $63 million in 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Thomas F. Riley painted a less optimistic picture, saying that 
the outlook of the county administrative office report does jeopardize county 
funding of "additional projects such as the arts." 
</P>
<P>
"If you took a look at figures we have now, to take on a new project certainly 
would not be something any of us on the board would be willing to do," Riley 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council sent a report last week to 
the Board of Supervisors recommending that the county contribute $125,000 
toward creation of a countywide arts agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the CAO's five-year financial forecast released this week predicts budget 
deficits in the next four out of five fiscal years and said that the county 
will have to find ways to cut spending or increase revenue to avoid these 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Desmarais, president of the ad-hoc Committee to Form an Orange County 
Arts Council, repeated Thursday that the committee's request for $125,000 -- 
"in cash and/or in-kind services" -- need not necessarily compete with other 
county programs, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that there may be alternative sources of (arts) 
funding," such as money from the airport enterprise fund generated by fees 
charged airlines and other airport users, said Desmarais, director of the 
Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez had said the forecast is not "a doomsday 
prophesy," though he, too, said it dims the prospect for funding new programs. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors are expected to give an official response to the committee's 
recommendations by April 2, when the county will have completed its own study 
of its role in local arts support. No money from the county's $2.9-billion 
budget is now earmarked for arts support. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he would wait until the county's arts study is complete to make a 
final comment on the issue. He also added that "there is always a possibility 
of (arts) funding coming from the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the enterprise fund might be another possibility, he said, "I'm not 
ruling it out, but I'm not sure at this time in the airport's activities 
whether that would be a fund we could reasonably ask for assistance." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors recently voted to apportion $40,000 from the enterprise fund to 
support an arts program at the new John Wayne Airport terminal, scheduled to 
open in September. 
</P>
<P>
Desmarais, however, maintains that the county should find some room in its 
budget for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me there are ways we spend our (county) money that could be looked 
at again," he said. "For instance, we have a really negative kind of emphasis 
on 'just saying no' to drugs without giving kids an opportunity to say 'yes' to 
something. The arts are such a life-affirming opportunity that the county could 
take advantage of."

As result of injury and substitution, the pair of star-cross'd lovers 
originally announced for the American Ballet Theatre performance of "Romeo and 
Juliet" on Thursday danced one day early at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Marianna Tcherkassky made a lyric, sweet Juliet who revealed unexpected 
dramatic depths and strengths in the later scenes. John Gardner, in his first 
casting as Romeo, drew only the outline of a dramatic character but proved a 
secure and considerate partner. 
</P>
<P>
While never a dancer who relied upon technique to dazzle, Tcherkassky 
compensated with purity of line and sincerity of emotion. For her, love at 
first sight meant a deeply felt pain that later turned impetuous and wild. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite that intensity, Gardner portrayed a genial, warm but self-effacing 
Romeo. He has yet to inhabit the role. He danced with careful, underpowered 
virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Boggs provided a wry, bemused Mercutio, pre-eminent among his friends in 
clear shape, vigor and non-stop momentum, and wrenching in his death scene. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross Yearsley was only a sketchy, untidy Benvolio. 
</P>
<P>
Ethan Brown made Tybalt the bully of Verona and, like a textbook bully, reacted 
with fear when he actually committed an act of violence -- in this case, 
killing Mercutio by accident. The moment relieved an otherwise oppressive 
single-note interpretation but passed all too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Dunham ventured an intriguing, atypical Rosaline, a woman who seemed 
not altogether indifferent toward Romeo. If only he hadn't caught sight of that 
other woman at the ball? 
</P>
<P>
In two cases, casting became almost prodigal: the authoritative Martine van 
Hamel as a determined and sympathetic Lady Capulet, and the virtuosic, airborne 
Johan Renvall ennobling the cameo solo duties in the Mandolin Dance. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Everly again conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Ballet Theatre continues through Sunday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 to $40.

CUTTING EDGE: HAIRSTYLE TRENDS ARE OUT, INDIVIDUALITY IS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAWN STONE, Dawn Stone is a senior at El Toro High School, where she is 
editor of the student news magazine, The BullETin, Keywanette treasurer and a 
member of the Academic Decathlon team. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teen-agers on the cutting edge are scissoring, shaving and dyeing their hair, 
and individual tastes and desires are taking precedence over clone cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids aren't as trendy as they used to be," said Rory LaBahn, a stylist at 
Headlines Hair Studio in El Toro. "If one person has it, they all don't get it. 
They're more individual now, but they won't go totally out of that realm of 
acceptability." 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Cory Bentley, 16, a senior at Mission Viejo High School, aim for a 
style both original and functional. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to cut it really short because I have 28 minutes to get ready in the 
morning before swimming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her hair, which used to be a perm with past-the-shoulders length, is now cut in 
a distinctive style: one side has close layers, the other long layers down to 
the middle of the ear with a gradual step from one side to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley said, though, that short hair is not too popular among the girls at her 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are trying to grow their hair out, to get it wavy and one length 
-- about six inches past their shoulders," she said. "I guess most people like 
long hair because it looks more feminine. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys have a complex about short hair," she laughed. "(They think) it doesn't 
make their girlfriends look feminine." 
</P>
<P>
Said LaBahn: "You see very few short haircuts for teen-agers. Some of them, 
though, are pretty fashionable, and they feel confident enough to go with short 
hair. A lot of those short, little wedgie haircuts are in." 
</P>
<P>
About long-haired teen-agers, LaBahn said: "A lot of them like perms, spiral 
perms. They've been out for a while, but now that everyone knows about them a 
little bit more, a lot of people want them." 
</P>
<P>
Leah Vu, 16, an El Toro High sophomore, chose not to follow the long, perm 
look. Her hair had been in a plain, bowl cut; however, now it features long, 
magenta-colored bangs, a close shave underneath and a shoulder-length top 
layer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sick and tire of having the same style and everything else seemed so 
boring and mundane," she said. "It's so much easier this way. Besides, I think 
blue, purple and pink are so much prettier than black, brown or blond." 
</P>
<P>
And how do her parents react to magenta hair? 
</P>
<P>
"At first they said I better dye it back or they'd cut it all off," Vu said. 
"They've kind of gotten used to it now." 
</P>
<P>
Said LaBahn: "(Teen-agers) pretty much stay out of color (for their hair). 
Parents don't really go for it. A lot of times, too, the affordability keeps 
kids away." Coloring can cost $25 to $35 each time it's applied, and colored 
hair needs to be touched up every month or so. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lewis, owner and stylist at The Endz in Orange, said, "We don't do a 
lot of wild cuts like we used to. You can't get a job with purple hair." 
</P>
<P>
Black-dyed hair has clouded over the rainbow colors. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Merriot, a 16-year-old El Toro junior, dyed his curly, light-brown hair an 
inky black and shaved the sides very close, leaving a mop of curls that spill 
onto his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the sides curly, so I shaved them myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other teen-agers who sport nonconformist hairstyles, Merriot says his 
cut is not inspired by musical tastes or heroes. However, it can't be denied 
that music does inspire some scissors work. 
</P>
<P>
O.J. Flowers, a 15-year-old freshman at El Toro, said that in his quest for a 
new hairstyle he "saw The Boys' haircut and really liked it." 
</P>
<P>
"My friends gave me ideas, and then I chose my own style," said Flowers, who 
decided on two shaved lines running along the side, with a clump of bangs in 
front and a close cut all the way around. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Brookman, a 17-year-old senior at El Toro, wanted short lines shaved on 
the side of his head -- two on the left and one on the right. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked (the stylist), 'Is this pretty popular?' and she said, 'No, no one's 
doing it anymore,' so I went for it," he said. "Besides, being that the track 
season is coming up, I had to have it short, and I wanted to put some style in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Said LaBahn: "A lot of times, (this is) the age that you first start 
experimenting with your hair. Once you've cut your hair, you're fine. Then 
you're on the road to trying different things." 
</P>

TAILOR-MADE ATTIRE LETS CLIENTS SUIT THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN LOGAN, Dan Logan is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If clothes make the man, they also explain him. 
</P>
<P>
A host of reasons, spoken and unspoken, send men and women to tailors for 
custom-made clothes. In subtle and not-so-subtle ways, personally tailored 
clothes hint at our self-image, fantasies, taste, creativity, concept of 
comfort and financial status. 
</P>
<P>
"My clients want it known that they're uniquely themselves," says Kristine 
Faison, owner of Fashion Forward, a tailor shop in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Style is just one advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Custom-made clothes usually display better workmanship, last longer and fit 
precisely, preventing puckering along the seams, says Denny Hoang, co-owner 
with his brother Tom of Newport Custom Tailors in Santa Ana. Clients also can 
request fabrics that resist wrinkling, a special incentive for people who 
travel regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, in opting for custom-made clothes, clients will simply be trying to 
duplicate an item of clothing. If they have a favorite pair of pants they've 
worn out, a tailor can take the garment apart and re-create it. And some 
customers -- mostly women -- find a fabric and bring it to a tailor to create 
something unique. 
</P>
<P>
Busy professionals tell Faison that going to a tailor is more time-efficient 
than searching for clothing in stores. "Shopping is a burden," she says, 
especially if they can't find the size or the style they want. 
</P>
<P>
Another appeal, Faison says, is the attention the tailor gives to the client. 
"First, they want the exclusivity and the attention," she explains. "Secondly, 
it's the self-confident feeling of getting something they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Women need more of a personal service. Women enjoy lots of discussion of 
styles and fabrics." 
</P>
<P>
The men with whom she deals want an honest opinion about how they look and how 
they're perceived, Faison says, adding "I'm the one who decides that." Faison's 
typical client is a Newport Beach woman 35 to 45 years old who's a professional 
herself or married to one. "They like to deal with someone who's competent, who 
gives them a secure feeling," she says. They usually don't come in for career 
wear, and if they do, Faison discourages them because there's a wide range of 
career wear in the market. 
</P>
<P>
These women prefer a stylish but conservative look. "I think women in Newport 
Beach are very conservative," Faison says. "This is not an eclectic-look place. 
They're not all that adventuresome." 
</P>
<P>
Her clients also trust her judgment. "That's the most important element in my 
business -- trust," says Faison, who began her career as a seamstress working 
for a tailor in Corona del Mar, then opened Fashion Forward in 1980. She has 
built a clientele that appreciates her outgoing personality and informal style. 
</P>
<P>
While she may encourage a client to abandon a concept that doesn't suit her, "I 
don't want to discourage creativity," she explains. "This is a very personal 
thing." Whatever motivates the individual to have clothes custom- made, the 
desired garment often starts out as little more than a vague, pleasant vision. 
In coming up with a finished product that pleases the client, Faison sees her 
role as part seamstress and part psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Her research, as she calls it, consists of asking questions and helping clients 
formulate what they have in mind. Faison wants to know what the client wants 
the item for, the occasion on which it will be worn and how the client sees him 
or herself. 
</P>
<P>
A degree of risk and responsibility goes with creating a finished product that 
she expects the client to like, Faison admits. A frivolous attitude on the part 
of the client can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction for both Faison and 
her customer. "I want them to be serious about what they want," she says. "I 
want them involved in what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
At Newport Custom Tailors in Santa Ana, Tom and Denny Hoang run a quiet, 
male-oriented world where half the business comes from tailoring custom suits, 
sport coats and shirts. Predictably, they have a high-income clientele. Clients 
like being able to have a custom-made suit in two weeks, Tom Hoang says, 
compared to the six to eight weeks it often takes to have a suit custom-made in 
New York or Hong Kong. Whereas Kristine Faison keeps only a small stock of 
fabrics on hand and works mainly with materials that are brought to her, men's 
tailors -- such as the Hoangs -- maintain a full stock of fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular material used for suits is a 9 1/2-ounce wool fabric by Roger 
LaViale Ltd., which the Hoangs consider a high quality mid-price line that is 
light enough for year-round use in Southern California. The most common suit 
colors are charcoal gray with pinstripes, and navy blue with pinstripes. The 
Hoangs say they are only infrequently asked to make vests. Suits cost from $550 
to $750. 
</P>
<P>
In a custom-made suit, the jackets are fully lined, while most trousers have a 
half-lining extending below the knee that prevents wrinkling along the thighs. 
Full trouser linings are used only if the material is light-colored and thin, 
or if it's a thicker wool that may cause itching. Sport coats, which are 
usually made from heavier 11-ounce wool, are common in navy blue, with various 
proportioned plaids and checks following in popularity, Tom Hoang says. White 
shirts account for about 50% of the shirts the Hoangs make. The most popular 
fabric is 100% cotton pinpoint, a light, cool material. The next most popular 
shirt is white with pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoangs are asked to put monograms on about 80% of their tailored shirts; 
most of these are monogrammed on the left sleeve. French cuffs also sell well, 
accounting for about 50% of the white shirts made, and these are usually 
monogrammed. The shirts usually are bought four at a time and sell for $55 to 
$75 each. Shirts are made in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Tailors say that knowing more about a client than just measurements can help 
them become a valued colleague. As Kristine Faison puts it: "I help my client 
look at herself as a fulfilled person. She doesn't have to look across the room 
and say, 'I want to look like that.' "

<TEXT>
<P>
One of two off-duty Los Angeles police officers working as security guards at a 
nightclub fatally shot an armed Santa Ana man early today during a fight at the 
Orange Fair Mall in Fullerton, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At least five people -- one with a baseball bat -- were involved in the fight 
at 2 a.m. when 22-year-old Eric Parga pulled out a semiautomatic handgun in the 
parking lot of Carnivale Disco, 1401 S. Lemon St., said Capt. Lee DeVore of the 
Fullerton Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
LAPD Officer Randy Garcia, 34, who was working with another off-duty officer, 
David Navarro, 32, saw Parga's gun and shot him with one round, said Sgt. Elmer 
Pellegrino of the Los Angeles department's officer-involved shooting team. 
</P>
<P>
Parga was taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital where he died a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who is assigned to the Metropolitan Division, is a 10-year veteran with 
the department. Navarro, an officer for 4 1/2 years, is assigned to the Newton 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's officer-involved shooting team will 
investigate the case with the Fullerton Police Department, DeVore said.

50 ILLEGALS SEIZED AT LAX IN THIRD INS SWEEP IN 2 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty illegal aliens were detained at Los Angeles International Airport as they 
waited to board flights to other parts of the country in the third big 
immigration sweep at airports in two days, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service detained the illegal 
aliens late Thursday, said Ben Davidian, INS western regional commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, immigration agents in Atlanta detained 53 illegal immigrants 
aboard an Eastern Airlines flight. It was the second consecutive day aliens 
were captured while trying to make their way to New York from the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, agents swept through terminals at Los Angeles International 
Airport and rounded up 50 suspected illegal aliens by midnight, Davidian said. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration authorities decided on the Los Angeles sweep after the arrests in 
Atlanta, where suspected illegal aliens were pulled from flights that 
originated in Los Angeles, Davidian said. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the sweeps, called Operation Red Eye Repeat, were part of 
a continuing operation in response to an increase in smuggling of illegal 
aliens. All major airports have been targeted, including Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is a real hub," Davidian said. "This is the main area where 
undocumented aliens want to come because there is so much employment." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the Los Angeles operation was a "drop in the bucket" 
compared to the 1,500 to 2,000 illegal workers that are picked up in the San 
Diego area every day. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 suspects detained Thursday night included people from Panama, Pakistan, 
India, Mexico and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal aliens picked up in Atlanta were the cargo in a massive smuggling 
ring that has been under investigation since last year, the INS said. Most of

A bomb threat forced evacuation of a Greyhound maintenance yard in downtown Los 
Angeles and police detectives who heard a ticking sound inside a suitcase were 
relieved to find it was only an alarm clock. 
</P>
<P>
The scare began around 8:40 p.m. Thursday with a threat phoned in by an 
anonymous caller who warned: "There's a bomb in the lobby . . . you have 20 
minutes to get out," police Sgt. Tom Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Strikers picketing the yard as well as employees working there fled while 
police bomb squad members searched the area.

A woman who kept dozens of malnourished and disease-ridden dogs, cats and birds 
in her Eagle Rock home was sentenced today to 60 days in County Jail and 
prohibited from owning any other pets while on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca E. Courlie, 44, will be allowed to delay serving the jail time pending 
the outcome of her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Courlie pleaded no contest last October to four counts of animal neglect and 
one count each of operating unlicensed kennels and failing to notify the 
Department of Public Works about dead animals on her property. 
</P>
<P>
Courlie was charged after city animal regulation officers, acting on an 
anonymous tip, searched her Eagle Rock home and found the carcasses of about 15 
dead animals as well as dozens of other malnourished and disease-ridden animals 
on Aug. 10, 1988.

Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the father she loves but has never known 
to come home today, the day Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The journalist's family, friends and colleagues somberly marked the anniversary 
with commemorations and prayers in Washington, New York and Cyprus. Yellow 
ribbons fluttered from trees, signs and poles in Anderson's hometown of 
Batavia, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is 
the longest-held of the American hostages in Lebanon. All told, 18 Westerners 
are believed to be captives there, including eight Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Former hostages chained themselves to a tree in Paris to protest Anderson's 
captivity, and President Bush pledged to work for the hostages' release. 
(Photo, P2.) 
</P>
<P>
But no message was as poignant as the one on television this evening in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In a videotape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome appeared, wearing a green 
coat and riding a bicycle given to her at Christmas in Anderson's name. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the bike for Christmas, daddy. Thank you," said Sulome, who was born 83 
days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"I love you Daddy, come home, please come home. I love you Daddy. Come home. 
Send me to the circus," she beseeched. The videotape was made earlier in the 
week and shipped to the television stations in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese newspapers also published a letter today signed "Sulome and 
Madeleine," from the girl and her mother, Madeleine Bassil, who wait in Cyprus 
for Anderson's release. 
</P>
<P>
"The world without God is not the world, it's hell. A home without a husband or 
father is not a home, it's hell," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am always wondering if you have ever been able to read the letters sent to 
you on different occasions, or even if they were read to you to let you know 
how much we love you and how different and difficult life is without you," 
Bassil wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Bush pledged to pursue "all legitimate opportunities" to win the 
release of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to keep open lines of communications with all parties, including 
Iran, who have influence over hostage-takers," the President said in a letter 
to Peggy Say, Anderson's sister. 
</P>
<P>
Say met privately with Bush and his wife at the White House, then addressed a 
ceremony across the street at Lafayette Park. Directing her remarks to the 
captors of her brother thousands of miles away, she said: "You complain that 
your story has not been told and yet the man who would tell it has been chained 
to a basement wall for five years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to punish them. I don't want to hunt them down. I just want my 
brother back. But I'm not going to pay them for doing so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not attend the ceremony, but said in a radio interview that "every day 
I'm President I have a heavy heart when I think of the hostages." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has declined to say he is optimistic that any hostages would be released 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass at St. Patrick's 
Cathedral.

COURT DENIES HARRIS' APPEAL OF EXECUTION

<P>
The California Supreme Court today denied the appeal of condemned killer Robert 
Alton Harris, making his April 3 execution at San Quentin more likely than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
The convicted double killer is set to be the first man to die in San Quentin's 
gas chamber in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is expected now to head quickly to federal court to press his argument 
for a delay in his execution. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the court's decision is the correct result. We are pleased the court 
denied his request," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane Gillette, head of the state's 
death penalty unit. "Mr. Harris has had a substantial opportunity over the last 
11 years to litigate these issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We assume there will be some effort to take the case to federal court and we 
are prepared to cover that should it arise," Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, must persuade a federal judge there is enough merit in his current 
appeal to halt the execution long enough to hear more detailed arguments or to 
order the new penalty hearing Harris has requested. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also has a separate request for clemency set for hearing by Gov. George 
Deukmejian on March 27 at San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, who authored the state's death penalty law while attorney 
general, is considered unlikely to reduce Harris' sentence to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and his brother, Daniel, bent on stealing a car to use in a bank 
robbery, abducted two teen-age boys in the parking lot of a fast-food 
restaurant and drove them to a rural spot outside San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The boys were shot by Robert Harris, who later drove back to his girlfriend's 
apartment and purportedly ate the boys' leftover hamburgers while joking about 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
The state's high court rejected the argument by lawyers for Harris that his 
years as the object of severe child abuse left him victim of post traumatic 
stress syndrome, similar to war veterans, and organic brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Harris contends that the new psychological information is the result of new 
research on child abuse developed since his sentencing in 1979.

Banks in Garden Grove, La Palma and Fullerton were robbed Thursday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Garden Grove robbery, a bank employee chased a bandit and held him until 
officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 2:15 p.m. when the robber entered First Interstate 
Bank in the 12000 block of Valley View Street. After presenting a note 
demanding money, the bandit left with an undisclosed amount of cash, Lt. Ron 
Weigand said. 
</P>
<P>
Weigand said a bank employee followed the man and detained him until officers 
arrived. All the money was recovered, Weigand said. Police later booked David 
Anderson, 38, on suspicion of bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are searching for suspects who held up banks in La Palma and 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
In the La Palma robbery, a man wearing dark sunglasses presented a note 
demanding money to a teller at the Sumitomo Bank in the 5000 block of 
Orangethorpe Avenue, a police spokeswoman said. The man escaped with an 
undisclosed amount of money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar incident occurred at 1:37 p.m. at the Sanwa Bank in the 3000 block of 
East Yorba Linda Boulevard in Fullerton, where a bandit escaped with an 
undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they do not believe that the incidents are related.

CHENEY SUSPECTS 'INCOMPETENCE' IN LIBYAN FIRE

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today he suspects that "Libyan 
incompetence," not sabotage, caused the fire that damaged the Rabta chemical 
factory and he dismissed Moammar Kadafi's threats against West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were the Germans, I don't think I'd be quaking in my boots at this 
point," Cheney said in response to a question at the National Newspaper Assn.'s 
Government Affairs Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader has pledged to retaliate if his government determines that 
West German sabotage was responsible for the fire Wednesday that seriously 
damaged the chemical factory at Rabta, 40 miles south of the Libyan capital of 
Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
The United States charged last week that the plant, which West German companies 
allegedly helped build, had started making chemical weapons. Libya has 
maintained that it was producing pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a darn shame what happened at Rabta," a smiling Cheney said 
sarcastically, when a member of the audience asked his reaction to the fire and 
Kadafi's threats. 
</P>
<P>
"I am inclined to attribute it more to Libyan incompetence than anything else," 
Cheney said of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the West German government said today that it will not tolerate 
threats against Germans living in Libya following the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government decisively rejects the Libyan attempt to blame the 
Federal Republic of Germany for the fire at Ratba," Juergen Chrobog, chief 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said in Bonn. "We especially denounce any 
attempt to rouse up Libyans against us."

SOUTH AFRICA REGIME SLATES ANC MEETING;

APARTHEID: WHITE MINORITY GOVERNMENT TO HAVE FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING WITH 
LONG-OUTLAWED BLACK GROUP IN BREAKTHROUGH.

<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa's white minority government, announcing a major political 
breakthrough, said today that it will hold its first official meeting with the 
long-outlawed African National Congress on April 11. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk said he will meet ANC leaders including Nelson 
R. Mandela, the movement's newly appointed deputy president, whom he freed last 
month after 27 years in prison for plotting to overthrow white rule. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a first step toward negotiations on a new constitution to 
enfranchise South Africa's black majority. 
</P>
<P>
"The state president, assisted by members of the Cabinet, will discuss with Mr. 
Mandela and the ANC leaders from outside and from within the country the 
obstacles perceived to obstruct the process toward negotiations," De Klerk said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is due back in South Africa on Saturday after a tour of African and 
European countries that reunited him with ANC leaders exiled since the 
guerrilla movement was banned in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk lifted the ban in February in one of a series of sweeping reforms of 
four decades of apartheid race segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Stockholm, where he was visiting ailing ANC President Oliver Tambo, 
Mandela said the meeting with the South African government will have to be more 
than a formality if negotiations are to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy is going to be that the very first meeting between the ANC and 
the government must produce a result if we are going to continue talking," he 
said in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
Fears for the future of negotiations have been fueled by a wave of unrest which 
has swept black townships and tribal homelands in the past month and cost more 
than 200 lives. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the worst violence has been in the 10 self-governing homelands created 
under apartheid, where millions of blacks forced by Pretoria to give up South 
African citizenship fear that they will miss out on De Klerk's promised 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials say they cannot lift a 3-year-old state of emergency until 
the unrest subsides. An end to the state of emergency is one of the ANC's key 
conditions to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders have repeatedly called for an end to 
the violence, and the need for black unity before negotiations began was a 
major theme of Mandela's speeches at rallies in all four provinces after his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC leader reiterated his movement's conditions today but said he is 
optimistic about negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mr. De Klerk does want change, and there are men advising him who I 
think do want change," he said.

Two teen-age boys were acquitted of raping a 16-year-old girl during a drinking 
party at the governor's mansion, a circuit judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The two 17-year-old boys and another 17-year-old have admitted to charges of 
underage consumption of alcohol stemming from the Nov. 28 incident in Pierre, 
Circuit Judge Marshall Young said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the boys was charged with non-forcible rape of the girl, who allegedly 
was not capable of giving consent because she was intoxicated, and another boy 
was charged with aiding and abetting rape. Following a two-day trial closed to 
reporters, Young said he found the state had not proved the rape charge and 
aiding-and-abetting charge. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Mickelson and his wife were out of town on the date of the alleged 
rape at the mansion. Their son David, 17, is the only other permanent resident 
there. The governor's office has refused to disclose his whereabouts that 
evening.

Japan has told the United States to remove a small display of American rice 
from a Japanese convention hall because it violates the country's strict rice 
import rules. 
</P>
<P>
Japan bans all imports of rice for commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sorry but we had explained to the (U.S. Agricultural Trade) office 
already last month that any samples would be prohibited, but I hear the office 
actually did offer some samples, or display for commercial purposes," an 
official at Japan's Food Agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Agricultural Trade Office is thus complying with the request from 
Japan's Food Agency to remove approximately two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of U.S. 
rice on display," an American Embassy spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government forbids the sale of foreign rice. Only imports for 
personal use of up to 220 pounds are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
A booth operated by the U.S. Rice Council will continue to provide information 
about U.S. rice until the convention ends Saturday, the embassy spokesman said.

PPG Industries has sold its 75% interest in West German equipment maker 
Lenhardt Maschinenbau GmbH, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer is Bystronic Maschinen AG of Butzberg, Switzerland. The purchase 
price was not given. General Manager Karl Lenhardt holds the remaining shares 
in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Lenhardt, based in Neuhausen-Hamberg, makes equipment used to produce 
insulating glass units and other fabricated glass products. Bystronic produces 
equipment for the glass, metals, plastics and agriculture industries. 
</P>
<P>
PPG said it sold its interest because the fabricating equipment business no 
longer is appropriate to its long-term strategic objectives. PPG is one of the 
world's leading producers of flat and fabricated glass.

A House member called today for mandatory jail terms and fines of up to 
$100,000 for employers who repeatedly violate child labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said child labor laws need to be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer, speaking before a House Government Operations subcommittee on 
employment and housing, called for increasing the civil penalties for child 
labor violations from $1,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
He said that between 1987 and 1989 there were 128,000 minors who were injured 
and an estimated 59 killed in the workplace. Yet 37 employers who were cited 
for violations relating to those cases were fined a total of only $27,000, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing came a day after Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole announced 
that a three-day sting operation had uncovered 7,000 minors employed in 
dangerous jobs or working long hours in violation of child labor laws.

<P>
The average Japanese family had stashed away $86,250 in savings as of 1989, 
confirming Japan's place as one of the world's most frugal countries, the 
government announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The average family added 15.3% to its already large nest egg in 1989, the 
highest growth rate since 1979, the Management and Coordination Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has complained in trade negotiations that Japan's high 
savings rate is a contributing factor to the massive U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan, which stood at $49 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's household savings rate, or the percentage of annual income an average 
family puts into savings, stood at 15.1% in 1989, one of the highest in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Americans saved on average only 6.3% of their income in 1989. 
The British saved 4.9%, and French and West Germans saved about 12%.

West German film director Werner Herzog's career is hitting a different note: 
He's planning to direct a new production of Mozart's "The Magic Flute" for the 
Metropolitan Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog's version of "Die Zauberflote" is to open Jan. 10, Met officials said. 
It is to be conducted by James Levine and features Kathleen Battle as Pamina, 
Francisco Araiza as Tamino, Kurt Moll as Sarastro, Luciana Serra as the Queen 
of the Night and Manfred Hemm as Papageno. 
</P>
<P>
"Die Zauberflote" is one of four Mozart operas the Met is presenting in its 
1990-91 season as part of the Lincoln Center's Mozart Bicentennial series, 
marking the 200th anniversary of the composer's death. The Met plans to perform 
seven Mozart operas in 1991.

RICKIE LEE JONES' TOUR OF VARIED LANDSCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rickie Lee Jones scanned the crowd near the Club Lingerie stage after her first 
number in the first of two shows there Thursday, hoping to see some 
non-familiar (i.e., non-"industry") faces in the footlights. "I was hoping very 
much that some real people got in 'cause I was trying to figure out who bought 
the tickets," she said earnestly, beaming that Cheshire Cat grin as the whoops 
and hollers told her the folks wuz real. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy for a star of Jones' magnitude to put on a "Saloon Tour" (so 
deemed in honor of her recent "Flying Cowboys" album) -- one that hits only 
nine cities and includes almost exclusively club dates, the exception being 
this Monday's Wiltern show -- and get the relatively few dance cards available 
into the hands of the cowpokes rather than the cattle barons, as it were. 
Amazingly, it seems to have worked. 
</P>
<P>
Not that this was a downscale crowd. Jones' most devoted fans may be those lost 
souls who live out their bohemianism vicariously through her jivey, jazzy, 
soulful music. Forget the Western similes that have been cropping up in Jones' 
metaphoric saddle for a moment: The theme song for this evening, and for many 
fans' identification, would surely be the slow, buoyant, urban funkiness of 
"Ghetto of My Mind," a good representation of just how Jones takes listeners to 
a looser landscape they may never know. Even as a settled-down mom, she still 
makes a great, cosmic conduit to The Street. 
</P>
<P>
Jones seemed quite cheerful on this stop, trotting out oldies like "Chuck E.'s 
in Love" without provocation in the midst of a set that included most of the 
"Cowboys" material. At performance's end, she sang "Autumn Leaves" with just 
piano and upright bass, assuring those who might not have known that, at heart 
and in spirit, she really is a phenomenal jazz singer. 
</P>
<P>
All of Jones' shows, including appearances Sunday at the Ventura Theatre and 
Monday at the Wiltern, are sold out. 
</P>
<P>
A complete review runs in Saturday's Calendar section.

RECORD SHOP CLERK ARRESTED IN SALE OF 'EXPLICIT' RAP TAPE

<P>
A teen-age record store clerk is facing a felony charge for allegedly selling 
the sexually explicit rap recording "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" to an 
11-year-old girl, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Chauncey Reese, a 19-year-old employee at Sarasota's Tracks record store, was 
arrested Thursday on a complaint by the girl's stepmother about the recording 
by the Miami Group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
Conviction on the charge of selling harmful materials to minors carries a 
maximum prison sentence of five years and a $5,000 fine, said Assistant State 
Atty. Donald Hartery Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Hartery said he filed the felony charge, rather than a misdemeanor count of 
obscenity, after listening to the tape given to police by the girl's 
stepmother, Ann Skolnick. 
</P>
<P>
"The tape is just out-and-out sex," said Skolnick, 35. "They use words like 
anal sex and how women want it. A child does not need to be hearing that." 
</P>
<P>
The tape bears a label warning of explicit language in the lyrics, Skolnick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reese, who is accused of selling the tape to the girl in January, was released 
on his own recognizance. Telephone messages left late Thursday at his home were 
not immediately answered.

Heavy metal rock star Ozzy Osbourne says he's not into Satanism or drugs. He 
just wants to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"All I really do is have Halloween every night I'm on stage," Osbourne said in 
an interview scheduled to air today on Channel 1, the Whittle Communications 
news and information program for teen-agers that began broadcasting into 
schools March 5. 
</P>
<P>
In a sermon earlier this month, Roman Catholic Cardinal John J. O'Connor said 
that heavy-metal music spiked with satanic lyrics created an atmosphere 
conducive to devil worship and demonic possession. 
</P>
<P>
Osbourne said it wasn't so. "There's no demonic message or anything freaky 
about it. It's just a bit of fun for the night and why not?" 
</P>
<P>
The rock star also said he condemns drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bad because you're living in a total fantasy world," he said.

Carole Merle of France won the women's last Super G to take the season title in 
the event, and Petra Kronberger of Austria virtually clinched the overall crown 
by finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
Merle clocked 55.17 seconds today, edging Michaela Gerg of West Germany by .9 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth straight World Cup victory for Merle, who almost decided to 
quit the season in late January after a five-month injury break. 
</P>
<P>
Kronberger, who finished .44 behind Merle, netted 15 points and increased her 
total to 341 with only two races left of the series. The 21-year-old 
Kronberger, who had not won a World Cup race before this season, is almost 
certain to become Austria's first women's overall champion since Annemarie 
Moser-Proell in 1979.

<P>
Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware will pass up his senior year and declare 
himself available for the NFL draft, the University of Houston quarterback said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the most difficult decision I have had to make in all my years. 
I have cherished my three years here but, for a variety of reasons, I am 
declaring myself for the NFL draft," Ware said in an emotional statement at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Ware said he would not discuss the information he used to make his decision but 
said he believes he made the right move. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision and I'll go with it 100%," he said. "It's not a bad 
decision either way. It was never my goal to be the No. 1 pick or go real high. 
The goal is to play pro football. 
</P>
<P>
"(San Francisco 49ers quarterback) Joe Montana wasn't a first-round pick and 
(Houston Oilers quarterback) Warren Moon wasn't even drafted, and he's one of 
the best. There was no one factor I looked at." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after winning the Heisman Trophy on Dec. 2, Ware guaranteed he would 
return for his senior season with the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Dec. 2 a lot of things have taken place at UH and in the NFL as far as 
allowing juniors into the draft," Ware said. "Yes, that statement bothered me a 
little, but you have to understand what all has happened since I made that 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach John Jenkins said that Ware is in an elite group of players who 
could benefit from leaving school early but that his decision should not be 
considered a message for all college players. 
</P>
<P>
"Young men who take this as a quick escape, let it be known that it's not," the 
coach said. "In Andre's case, he's close to getting his degree and he will get 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Speculation among some National Football League observers is that Ware would 
benefit from another year of collegiate seasoning, despite his record-setting 
1989 season.

CANTERBURY DOWNS' OPENING GETS BOOST

The sale of Canterbury Downs' stock to Michigan investors Herbert Tyner and 
Bernie Hartman improves the track's chances of opening for a sixth season on 
April 27 as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Fields Jr.; his nephew, Brooks Hauser; Scottland Inc., and Santa Anita 
Realty Corp. signed over 100% of the track's stock as well as Santa Anita's 
management contract to Tyner and Hartman Thursday for an undisclosed price, 
believed to be less than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The track is sold," Fields said. "Tyner and Hartman own all of the stock." 
</P>
<P>
Control of Canterbury won't officially change hands until a related deal is 
completed with the track's prospective operators. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending is Tyner and Hartman's agreement in principle to sell operational 
control and a substantial portion of the track's stock to Ladbroke Racing 
Corp., a British bookmaking firm with extensive holdings in U.S. race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
T. G. Preston of Mona, Meyer and McGrath, a Minneapolis public relations firm 
representing Ladbroke, said the deal with Tyner and Hartman should be completed 
within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Preston said, however, that Canterbury will "open on the backstretch, April 12" 
to permit horses and trainers to prepare for the season while the Ladbroke deal 
is made final. 
</P>
<P>
David Goodwill, vice president of Ladbroke's U.S. operations, confirmed that 
Ladbroke is seeking 100% operational control. 
</P>
<P>
Ladbroke, Tyner and Hartman jointly paid $20,000 in fees last week to the 
Minnesota Racing Commission so that their required background investigations 
can proceed. The investigations and licensing are expected to take about 30 
days.

Ladbroke officials also have been at Canterbury this week formulating policy 
with the track's staff. 
</P>
<P>
Fields and his partners, who built Canterbury in 1985 and added improvements 
the next year for an estimated total cost of $80 million, owned the track for 
five years. During that time, the track lost more than $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
During Canterbury's first two seasons of thoroughbred racing, average daily 
attendance had been more than 12,500, 20% higher than projected, and the 
average daily wagering handle was $1 million, about 5% below projections. 
</P>
<P>
The track's experimental harness racing meet in the fall of 1986 generated a 
loss of $5 million, however, and daily average attendance and handle for the 
thoroughbred meet declined steadily in each succeeding season to 7,239 and 
$844,525 respectively in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
During the last five years Ladbroke -- owner of more than 2,000 betting shops 
in Great Britain as well as the Hilton International Hotel chain -- has bought 
several American race tracks in financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Ladbroke bought Tyner and Hartman's lease on Detroit Race Course for 
an estimated $13 million. Last year it acquired three other tracks, including 
Golden Gate Fields in Northern California.

WHEN TOP-SHOT KIMBLE SCORES, BALL HAS GATHERS' NAME ON IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Kimble has said every point he scores for the rest of his life will be for 
his friend and fallen teammate, Hank Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
That figures to be a lot of points. 
</P>
<P>
Though Gathers' death has cast a pall on the basketball season for Loyola 
Marymount, Kimble is working on one of the great scoring seasons in NCAA 
history, leading the nation at 35.3 points per game and standing within 12 
points of joining the exclusive 1,000-point club. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble already has the 16th most prolific season in Division I annals. With a 
good game tonight against New Mexico State in the NCAA Tournament, Kimble can 
eclipse Gathers' total of 1,015 last season and join his boyhood friend as one 
of 13 players to top 1,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lions manage to advance to the regional finals next weekend, Kimble 
could approach the 1,100 mark, a total only Hersey Hawkins has topped in the 
last 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble has scored 50 or more points four times this season -- not even counting 
the 57 he scored in an exhibition against Athletes in Action -- and averaged 
more than 40 points for a six-game stretch when Gathers missed several games in 
December and was sub-par for several games thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the increased scoring came from moving Kimble from a wing to a low post 
spot. "Once I get the ball down low, I have so many moves they can't stop me," 
Kimble said this week. "I guarantee I'll shoot 20 free throws." 
</P>
<P>
When Kimble is scoring inside, he is doubly tough for defenders, who have to be 
aware of his three-point range as well. 
</P>
<P>
During his scoring spree, Kimble made 63 of 68 free throws and was 12 for 12 
against Athletes in Action. Later in the season he made 32 straight foul shots 
over three games. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a slight difference tonight, however, and for the rest of his 
career. Kimble said that to honor Gathers, who switched to left-handed foul 
shots this season, he will shoot his first free throw of every game 
left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"I made 22 of 30 this week and hit about 12 in a row," Kimble said. "It needs 
some work, but it'll get there." 
</P>

Costa Mesa is king when it comes to money and clothes in Orange County. In the 
first quarter of 1989 (the most recent period from which information is 
available), Costa Mesa had the highest taxable sales of clothing and shoes, the 
largest per capita and per store sales and the biggest percentage of all sales 
in the county. Its first quarter, 1989, sales increase over first quarter, 
1988, was topped only by the 185% increase in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
the comparable period of 1988 and 39% more than 1987.

FDA TO BAN SULFITES ON POTATOES, CITES 4 ALLERGY-RELATED DEATHS

The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it will extend a ban on the use 
of sulfites to include fresh potatoes because of severe allergic reactions to 
the preservative, including four deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA banned use of sulfites on fruit and produce on salad bars in 1986, but 
potatoes were excluded from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
After strong industry lobbying, the FDA decided to study further whether the 
ban should extend to potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
An industry spokesman said the ban would have little impact on consumers but 
would hurt many businesses that prepare potatoes for use in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it has received nearly 1,000 complaints of adverse reactions to 
sulfites since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the reported reactions were mild, including dizziness, cramps or 
wheezing. But, occasionally, reactions can cause breathing difficulty that can 
lead to death. 
</P>
<P>
Four deaths have been reported after consumption of sulfite-treated potatoes, 
the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
Up to a million asthmatics may be sensitive to sulfites, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The new ban, published in Thursday's Federal Register, will go into effect in 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest applauded 
the ban on sulfite-treated potatoes, saying it was "long overdue and indicative 
of a new outlook on these types of problems" by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Sulfites are used on peeled potatoes to keep them white and firm. The 
preservative usually is added after potatoes are cut up for distribution to 
fast food and other restaurants.

A QUIET ADVOCATE FOR THE CHILD; 
</P>
<P>
PSYCHOLOGY: THE LATE BRUNO BETTELHEIM REWROTE THE CODE OF TREATMENT FOR 
EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After 50 years of study on children's behavior, psychoanalyst Bruno 
Bettelheim's last words of advice to parents were heartening: Relax and have 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Bettelheim, a renowned figure in child psychotherapy, died Tuesday in a Silver 
Spring, Md., nursing home at 86. He apparently committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
An outspoken author and lecturer, Bettelheim deeply influenced his colleagues 
but was less well known to the public. In a career indelibly influenced by his 
years as a Nazi concentration camp prisoner, Bettelheim left his mark by 
rewriting the code of treatment for emotionally disturbed children and by 
explaining the role of fairy tales in child development. 
</P>
<P>
Because Bettelheim influenced his field in a quiet manner, some say he may not 
receive credit for many of his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his career was devoted to treating emotionally disturbed children, but 
his last book, written in Los Angeles and published in 1987, reached out to 
distressed parents with cheer. In "A Good Enough Parent," Bettelheim suggested 
that most people can become satisfactory parents without relying on expert 
advice and how-to manuals. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are leery of such advice even as they seek it, he said. And yet he 
sympathized with parents: "Many people do not hesitate to accept the advice 
these books offer; the fear of failure is so great." 
</P>
<P>
In his forceful, if somewhat long-winded style, Bettelheim wrote that parents 
should not rely blindly on others' opinions but should forge unique blueprints 
to shape their children. 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'Don't worry so much. You're not responsible for everything that 
happens to your child,' " said Jacquelyn Sanders, director of the Sonia 
Shankman Orthogenic School for disturbed children in Chicago, which Bettelheim 
directed for almost 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
While Bettelheim wrote his last book to summarize his views, much of his advice 
blends in so well with current child-rearing thinking that it probably will not 
be attributed to him, Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that his influence has been so pervasive that some of the most 
important ways that he has influenced the field have not been associated with 
his name," she said, noting that, besides the Orthogenic School, few models of 
Bettelheim's philosophy exist. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost an advocate of the child, Bettelheim offered revolutionary views on 
how institutionalized children should be treated, ideas that now have become 
standard procedure, said Dr. Joseph Noshpitz, a noted Washington child 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a man who spoke most fundamentally for the ethic of valuing children," 
Noshpitz said. "Again and again, he called people's attention to where society 
failed children, to where treatment needs were not met, to where parents were 
falling short. . . . Born in Vienna and trained in Freudian psychiatry, 
Bettelheim absorbed parts of others' theories, then carved his own version of 
child behavior. Before it became fashionable, he advocated viewing life through 
a child's eyes. His work with emotionally ill children centered on accepting 
the child's actions -- even aberrant behavior -- as normal for that individual. 
</P>
<P>
"He viewed children as doing things for a reason, and on treating children with 
respect," Sanders said. "We never looked at these kids as different from us. 
The idea was that these kids were extremes of the normal. . . . If you wanted 
to understand them, you had to look into yourself first." 
</P>
<P>
At the Orthogenic Center, a residential treatment institution, Bettelheim left 
the doors unlocked and let children eat what they desired. He disapproved of 
behavior-altering drugs and encouraged children to remain at the center for as 
long as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Bettelheim explored the events of his own life to learn about human behavior, 
said Rudolph Ekstein, a Los Angeles psychoanalyst and his longtime friend and 
colleague 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, after beginning his work with disturbed children, Bettelheim was 
arrested by the Germans and sent to the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration 
camps, where "his philosophy for treating (disturbed) children was derived," 
Ekstein said. "His philosophy was that there is a door to the house. From the 
outside, anybody who wants to can get in. But from the inside, the door is 
never open and the children can never run out. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt free to turn that around. He was saying life is not a concentration 
camp. I want a safe place for children. So the environment was not imposed on 
children. They could always get out." 
</P>
<P>
Always seeking a window to enter children's minds, Bettelheim -- who came to 
the United States, partly through the intervention of Eleanor Roosevelt -- 
clarified the role of fairy tales in child development in his hallmark 1976 
book, "The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales." 
</P>
<P>
Downplaying children's fascination with wicked characters and violence, 
Bettelheim explained that fairy tales deal with themes of normal development 
and provide children with an escape from basic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bettelheim's work on fairy tales influenced the field, said T. Barry Brazelton, 
a Boston pediatrician and popular child-rearing expert. "I thought his book on 
fairy tales was very good and very helpful to parents," Brazelton said. "I 
thought it certainly helped us feel better about what children watch on 
television." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his life's work, Bettelheim never achieved the kind of parental 
following that Brazelton or Benjamin Spock, the '60s child guru, did. Still, in 
his later years, Bettelheim focused on the problems of modern parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career, he was attacked by some parents' groups for his 
controversial view that some children become autistic because of their 
environment. (Autistic children have normal intelligence but are unable to 
communicate and often are withdrawn and asocial.) 
</P>
<P>
"That is not held today," Noshpitz said of Bettelheim's early autism theory. 
Autism's cause now "is thought to be biological. But that was really a 
reflection of his basic assumption that all parents have to face in dealing 
with their children (is) that children are, in many ways, a product of our 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bettelheim appeared to soften toward parents. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to blame structural changes in society -- such as divorce, 
step-parenting and working mothers -- for parents' problems. Instead, he 
shifted blame to the breakup of the extended family. 
</P>
<P>
He never, however, deviated from his primary position as child advocate. In 
1967, Bettelheim voiced his distaste for spanking children and encouraged 
parents to send misbehaving youngsters to their bedrooms for a period of time 
to indicate disapproval -- concepts now popular with child-development experts. 
</P>
<P>
He counseled parents caught in a standoff with their child to follow simple 
steps -- to remain calm, to examine their own thinking and reactions and to 
consider what's going on in their child's mind. "It is such self-exploration 
which often provides the best clues for understanding and helping one's child," 
Bettelheim said. 
</P>
<P>
In "A Good Enough Parent," Bettelheim sympathized with parents, contending they 
have been set adrift because they both now often are forced to work and lack 
support from relatives. Bettelheim said parents need to give themselves a 
break. "From the very beginning, I consider it important to assure parents that 
they need not strive for perfection, because it doesn't exist," he said. 
"Besides, it's not a characteristic of human nature." 
</P>
<P>
Bettelheim encouraged parents to shrug off their mistakes, to let their 
children see their human side but to try to shape them by setting good 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the most effective way to help others with child-rearing is not to 
offer how-tos -- to say, 'Follow instructions here to construct a successful 
child' -- nor to offer 'Right ways and wrong ways.' 
</P>
<P>
"I am suggesting instead," he said, "that parents, as well-intentioned, 
intelligent persons, can develop their own insights about child-rearing and 
find their own solutions."

THE BANKER BEHIND JAPAN'S RISING RATES; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: YASUSHI MIENO, GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF JAPAN, IS SEEKING TO FIGHT 
INFLATION AND PROTECT THE YEN. HIS ACTIONS, CONTROVERSIAL AT HOME, HAVE ALSO 
AFFECTED U.S. MORTGAGE MARKETS.

<P>
When Yasushi Mieno's flight lifted off for a nine-day European trip last week, 
investors as far away as America took careful note: Japanese interest rates, it 
appeared, wouldn't be rising, at least for a little while. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Japan's chief banker, inflation fighter and a man who stands today in the 
cross-fire of global economic forces. As governor of the Bank of Japan, Mieno 
-- a devotee of literature, art and golf -- seeks to protect the value of the 
embattled yen, a role that can lead to controversy at home and has important 
effects as far away as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Recent interest rate hikes in Japan, for example, probably are one of the 
reasons that U.S. rates on mortgages have edged up lately. Indirectly, Japanese 
interest rates also can affect the U.S. dollar's value on currency markets and 
therefore the price of American exports to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about a very big player, a dominant player," John Oliver 
Wilson, chief economist at the Bank of America in San Francisco, said of Mieno. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mieno's room to maneuver is sharply limited, even in a time when the yen 
has weakened dramatically and Tokyo's stock market faces turbulence. Major 
decisions by the Japanese central bank routinely must be cleared with the 
powerful Ministry of Finance, where the political fallout of proposed interest 
rate hikes is weighed carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, so strong is the Finance Ministry's influence that career officials 
from the ministry and the bank serve alternately in the governor's post. 
Mieno's predecessor, Satoshi Sumita, came from the Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
According to press accounts, Mieno failed to get full approval from the 
ministry before he sought to boost the discount rate charged to commercial 
banks after taking office Dec. 17. There followed an unusually visible flap, in 
which the plan was derailed until the banker, who turns 66 Saturday, smoothed 
things over with Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's more independence (by the Bank of Japan) than we've seen for a 
long time," Wilson said. "You've never had such a public difference of view on 
something as important as whether an interest rate should be raised or not." 
</P>
<P>
Born into a family that ranked among Japan's bureaucratic elite -- his father 
was an executive of the Japanese government's Manchurian Railways -- Mieno 
spent 16 of the first 17 years of his life in northeast China, switching from 
school to school as his father was transferred from one job to the next. 
</P>
<P>
When World War II ended, his father lost everything. The younger Mieno peddled 
soap, butter, clothes and other black-market commodities to support his parents 
and his younger brother and sister, both of whom had tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the early hardships, his career followed an elite path. As a teen-ager, 
Mieno passed the entrance examination for the ultra-elite former Tokyo No. 1 
High School and went on to the prestigious Tokyo University's law school. (For 
one year during college, Mieno lived in a sumo wrestlers' "stable" run by a 
friend's father. Mieno himself was not a sumo wrestler.) 
</P>
<P>
He has spent his entire working life since 1947 with the central bank, where 
colleagues dubbed him "Prince of the Bank of Japan" long before the prime 
minister appointed him its governor. 
</P>
<P>
Yet associates say the trials of his youth have left a mark. Mieno once said 
that when he, as deputy director of the central bank's personnel department, 
ordered transfers of employees, "I always wondered whether their children would 
feel the pain I suffered" in entering new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Said one central bank official: "He may appear to be the type who thinks only 
in broad policies, but he listens very carefully to minute details. Once he 
makes up his mind, however, he carries out his decisions with firmness." 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that the robust Japanese economy requires a firm hand to lead it 
these days. The yen -- now trading at above 152 to the dollar -- has plunged to 
its lowest level in roughly three years. And concern is spreading over 
financial speculation and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Mieno has been warning that a growing labor shortage and the cheapening of the 
yen's value -- which drives up prices in Japan of dollar-denominated raw 
material and energy imports -- threaten price rises. 
</P>
<P>
"In the current environment, if you didn't have one conservative, cautious 
voice speaking out, the yen could be even weaker," said Robert H. Chandross, 
chief economist for North America at Lloyds Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mieno's voice is clear: He has described his role as "the watchdog of prices," 
committed to "safe driving" of the Japanese economy on a course that will avoid 
inflation and facilitate growth worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
In a metaphor many found startling, he recently compared inflation to a loose 
thread on a kimono, one that could unravel with ruinous consequences for the 
Japanese economy -- "a direct and even frightening statement," recalled Deborah 
Allen, the Tokyo-based president of the Claremont Economics Institute. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Mieno decried "extremely speculative" financial moves that he said 
were damaging the value of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
But if Mieno's anti-inflation goal is clear, his full authority to raise 
interest rates to enforce the goal is not. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the Bank of Japan has been much weaker and subordinate an 
institution than, say, the stubbornly independent Bundesbank of West Germany or 
the U.S. Federal Reserve. It is unthinkable, for instance, that Mieno would be 
able to pursue interest rate policies that could seriously harm his nation's 
political leaders -- as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker 
did when Jimmy Carter was President. 
</P>
<P>
As the yen has suffered on currency markets, the Bank of Japan has limited its 
actions to intervening with more than $10 billion of spending in the last two 
weeks in a futile attempt to prop up its value. 
</P>
<P>
Mieno "is considered a very strong person among Bank of Japan officials," 
observed Charlie Nakayama, a senior vice president with First Interstate Bank 
in Tokyo. "But, basically, the Bank of Japan officials have very weak 
personalities." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after assuming his post, Mieno said he wanted to tighten "easy money" 
conditions in Japan, a situation widely viewed as inflationary. Since then, 
however, no trace of a slowdown in the money supply has occurred. And he has 
held off on a fourth increase since last May in the discount rate far longer 
than the currency and stock markets had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Maintained Frances Rosenbluth, a professor of Japanese political economy at UC 
San Diego: "There is some tension" between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry 
of Finance, "but for the most part, the Finance Ministry is able to call the 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mieno's role is critical, and professional investors on both sides of the 
Pacific follow his moves with great interest. When he left Tokyo last week, his 
departure itself was interpreted by dealers on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange 
Market as meaning there would be no increase until he returned. A new round of 
yen selling occurred immediately, and the currency plunged. 
</P>
<P>
Since his return Thursday, expectations have been running high that he will 
order another increase in the discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
While such a decision may seem far removed from events in the United States, 
the reality is quite different. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rate hikes in major countries, such as Japan and West Germany, can 
make U.S. Treasury offerings less attractive to investors, pressuring U.S. 
interest rates upward. And the stakes are high: America depends on Japanese 
investors to help finance its budget deficit by their purchases of Treasury 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if rising Japanese rates make U.S. rates appear unattractive, "it's going 
to affect your mortgage rate. It's going to affect revolving credit," said Joe 
Wahed, chief economist with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "The whole 
spectrum of interest rates will be affected one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mieno has served abroad only once -- in New York in the late 1950s -- 
the perspective he brings to important global relationships is not provincial. 
</P>
<P>
He speaks often about the need to maintain international confidence in Japan's 
financial system and to open its markets to foreign investors. Associates give 
him major credit for upholding confidence in Japan by helping arrange the 1975 
bailout of the Ataka Trading Co., which had major foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky is one of his favorite authors, and he 
likes French Impressionist art. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1985 newspaper essay, he confessed that one of his secret pleasures as a 
teen-ager living in Anshan in northern China was to sneak out with his 
classmates and go drinking in the Chinese sections of the city. The risk of 
getting caught was minimal, he wrote -- no Japanese teacher ever ventured into 
the Chinese districts. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the banker is faced with strategic calculations that are vastly 
more complex. When he took office in December, consultations on the third 
discount rate increase of 1989 were under way. But the bid might have proceeded 
more smoothly had Mieno done more consulting at the highest levels. "He 
probably gave one or two telephone calls," said First Interstate's Nakayama. 
"That's not polite enough from the Ministry of Finance's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
(In fact, Mieno is polite even by the high standards of Japanese society and is 
said to always check to see whether someone is following him before he closes a 
door.) 
</P>
<P>
Just what did transpire in the December flap remains a mystery. A senior 
central bank official, who asked not to be identified, said that a "leak" of 
the impending rate hike found its way into the mass media -- and both Hashimoto 
and Mieno "got mad and postponed the rate hike." 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been a disagreement between the two men, the discount rate would 
not have been raised," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
It ultimately was raised on Dec. 25 to its current level of 4.25%.

<P>
Tom Harmon, Old 98, died Thursday of a heart attack shortly after playing 18 
holes of golf at the Bel-Air Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, 70, won a tournament with Dr. David Boska as his partner earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
From the country club, Harmon drove to the Amelia Travel Agency in West Los 
Angeles, where he became ill. 
</P>
<P>
He told employees there to call Dr. Boska at his office on San Vicente 
Boulevard because he was feeling ill, but he soon passed out and paramedics 
were called to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to UCLA Medical Center, which issued the following statement: 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Harmon, age 70, died of cardiac arrest at 6:40 p.m. in the emergency room 
at UCLA Medical Center. He was brought to the emergency room at 6:08 p.m. by 
the paramedics in full cardiac arrest. After efforts of resuscitation, he was 
pronounced dead." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon's son Mark, a motion picture and television star, said funeral 
arrangements are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Speck, a longtime friend, said Harmon went to the travel agency to pick up 
tickets for a trip to a celebrity golf tournament. Speck wasn't sure where the 
tournament takes place. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Tom yesterday," Speck said, "and he was feeling fine." 
</P>
<P>
Speck said Harmon had four birdies on the front nine Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon suffered a heart attack a little more than two years ago at the age of 
68, according to Speck. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, best known as a football star at the University of Michigan, won the 
Heisman Trophy in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1940, Harmon, a two-time All-American, was named the Associated Press 
athlete of the year and recipient of the Maxwell Award as the college football 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He was the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft of December, 1940. He was chosen by the 
Chicago Bears, who had the Philadelphia Eagles' first choice that year. 
</P>
<P>
But he never played for the Bears, instead going with the New York Americans of 
a rival league. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, he served in the U.S. Air Force and was awarded the Silver 
Star and the Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon survived bailouts from two destroyed planes. 
</P>
<P>
He crashed in the South American jungle, en route to North Africa, and walked 
out six days later. 
</P>
<P>
He also was shot down over the Yangtze River in China in a dogfight with a 
Zero, and was rescued 32 days later by a Chinese Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, he played for the Rams in 1946 and '47, but showed only 
flashes of his former greatness because his legs had been burned and injured in 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the Rams, he married Hollywood film actress Elyse Knox, whom he 
met on the Bing Crosby radio show. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Mark, who was a quarterback at UCLA, their children are Kristin, who 
was married to the late Ricky Nelson, and Kelly, a commercial actress and 
model. 
</P>
<P>
After football, Harmon got into sports broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
He did the play-by-play on the first-ever Rose Bowl telecast for NBC in the 
late '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon later worked at KTLA, from 1958 through '64, doing nightly sports when 
Speck, now an independent sports packager and producer, also worked at the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
He later had two stints as the UCLA football play-by-play announcer at KTLA, 
when Speck was the sports director. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon stayed closely associated with Speck, and in recent years was the host 
of the "Raider Playbook" show, produced by Speck. The show is carried by 
Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
Speck said Harmon was to continue hosting the shows this season. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon had done some play-by-play on Raider exhibition games in recent years, 
and was still doing commercial work, but his No. 1 activity was playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon first did nightly sports on Channel 2 before moving over to KTLA with 
Clete Roberts and Bill Stout in 1958. Roberts, Stout and Harmon were known as 
the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
When Harmon left KTLA in 1964, he got out of broadcasting except for a national 
ABC Radio show. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to broadcasting a couple of years later, replacing Keith Jackson as 
KTLA's UCLA play-by-play announcer. 
</P>
<P>
He left that job, but returned when son Mark, a transfer from Pierce College, 
became UCLA's starting quarterback in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Harmon was born Sept. 28, 1919, in Gary, Ind., the son of Gary policeman 
Louis A. Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
His older brothers, Lou and Harold, starred in basketball and track at Purdue, 
and another brother, Gene, was a basketball star at Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
Tom won 14 varsity letters in four sports at Horace Mann High School in Gary. 
He won the state championships in the 100-yard dash and 220-yard low hurdles 
and the national interscholastic scoring championship with 150 points. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon's high school football coach, Dick Kerr, a former Michigan player, got 
Harmon interested in the Ann Arbor campus by taking the high school backfield 
to football clinics held there during spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
As a starter at Michigan from 1938 through '40, Harmon impressed the nation 
with his exploits, demonstrating triple-threat versatility as a runner, passer 
and kicker. He also played defense. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being called Old 98, he was also dubbed the Gary Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
During his Michigan career, he gained 2,134 yards rushing in 398 carries, 
completed 101 of 233 passes for 1,396 yards, scored 237 points with 33 
touchdowns, and led the nation in scoring in both 1939 and '40. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon was a tailback in Michigan's explosive single-wing attack. Quarterback 
Forest Evashevski blocked for Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1939 game against Iowa, Harmon scored all 27 points for the Wolverines, 
including a 95-yard pass interception. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1937 game against Pennsylvania, he gained 203 yards, scored twice and 
passed for a third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But Harmon's most legendary game came against at California on his 21st 
birthday -- Sept. 28, 1940. 
</P>
<P>
In a game Michigan won, 41-0, Harmon scored on runs of 94, 72, 82 and 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He scored on the opening kickoff and on his first rush from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, he returned a punt 86 yards for a touchdown on a 
memorable play in which a fan, Bud Brennan, came onto the field and ran 
interference for Harmon. Photos went around the world. 
</P>
