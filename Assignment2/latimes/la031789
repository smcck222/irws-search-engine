The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was preparing to ban importation of 
another 25 models of semiautomatic weapons but was ordered to hold off on the 
move by Treasury Department officials after the National Rifle Assn. raised 
objections, Administration sources said. James Jay Baker, a senior NRA officer, 
said that on Wednesday night the group learned that other weapons might be 
added to the list of five types of assault weapons that had been temporarily 
banned the day before at the request of drug czar William J. Bennett. It 
contacted Treasury officials, who said there would not be any new restrictions. 
Government officials said the bureau had informed importers that it was 
considering expanding the ban and had planned to announce the action Thursday. 
This new order would have covered many smaller, less-popular models.

A passenger who tries to take a gun through an airport screening point, even 
unwittingly, could be fined at least $1,000 under a newly toughened Federal 
Aviation Administration policy, a spokesman said. If the weapon is loaded or 
there is an attempt to conceal it, fines could range up to $10,000, said 
spokesman Fred Farrar. Previously, FAA regional authorities could pursue 
smaller fines against first-time offenders or issue warnings. Under the new 
order, a penalty of $1,000 would be sought in civil court if the firearm was 
unloaded and ammunition was not accessible to the passenger.

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest of Constabile (Gus) Farace, sought in connection with the murder of 
an undercover agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Thornburgh joined 
FBI Director William S. Sessions and DEA Administrator John Lawn in pledging 
that "all the resources of the DEA, FBI and Justice Department are committed to 
apprehending" Farace. Law enforcement agents fanned out across New York City in 
a hunt for Farace after agent Everett Hatcher, 46, who was married and had two 
children, was found slumped in his car Feb. 28. He had been shot at close 
range. Shortly before he was found on Staten Island, Hatcher had been scheduled 
to meet for a fourth time with Farace, who earlier had sold him an eighth of a 
kilogram of cocaine, valued at $4,000.

Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou accepted the resignation of all 54 
ministers in his Cabinet, clearing the way for a government shake-up in a 
political crisis over a bank scandal. The Cabinet reshuffle will be the second 
since the $200-million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal involving a 
fugitive Greek banker broke five months ago, leading to resignations of eight 
Cabinet ministers. Government sources indicated that Papandreou intends to use 
the resignations to purge the Socialist government of ministers implicated in 
the Bank of Crete scandal and attract waning support for his governing 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement. The new Cabinet is expected to be named today.

The Lompoc Elks Lodge turned down a black man's application for membership, but 
accepted six whites, prompting the local National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People to accuse the group of racism. Realtor Joe Martin, 56, said he 
was "disappointed" but not too surprised that he was rejected by nine of the 
150 Elks who attended the meeting. Another black man, Ernie Hutchinson, was 
rejected by the club in January, causing several members to resign. Hutchinson 
is a Lompoc housing official and an ex-police officer. NAACP spokesman Art 
Hicks said the Elks' blackball voting system discriminates against blacks.

The Soviet Union has increased its military presence in the Persian Gulf since 
the Iran-Iraq cease-fire despite publicly urging withdrawal of foreign navies 
from the region, a top U.S. commander said in Manama, Bahrain. "I see no 
withdrawal of the Soviets in this area," said Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who 
commands U.S. forces in the gulf in his post as chief of the U.S. Central 
Command. "As a matter of fact . . . I see an increase in their diplomatic 
initiatives . . . and their military assistance initiatives." Schwarzkopf said 
there has been a gradual reduction of U.S. forces in the gulf since the Aug. 20 
cease-fire but that the United States will keep at least six warships in the 
region.

A Nicaraguan delegation will visit Contra camps in Honduras this month to look 
into allegations that the rebels are holding Nicaraguans against their will, 
the archbishop of Managua announced. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo spoke after 
the National Reconciliation Commission, which he heads, met to discuss recent 
peace moves. Obando said that the delegation, made up of members of Parliament, 
opposition politicians and a Roman Catholic bishop, will travel to Honduras on 
March 28. An estimated 11,000 Contras are in the Honduran camps. Nicaragua's 
Sandinista regime alleges that the Contras have compelled thousands of peasants 
to serve in their ranks.

PARTYING STUDENTS INVADE HOUSE, LEAVE A MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of students apparently angry about being evicted retaliated by throwing 
a very expensive house party near San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
The party last week and ensuing vandalism left the house, in the 5000 block of 
Alumni Place, in a shambles that will take up to $25,000 to repair, said 
Detective Norm Hardman of the San Diego Police. The students passed a flyer 
around campus that advertised an "eviction party" on March 10, and encouraged 
participants to come and "barf" on the walls. "Who carez (sic)," the flyer 
read, "it's not my house." 
</P>
<P>
The students forced their way through a door into the house, where they 
allegedly proceeded to vandalize the premises. Floor tiles were cracked and 
broken, windows were smashed, holes were punched in walls. One wall, Hardman 
said, "looked like they were playing head-butting contests." There were holes 
in the ceiling and graffiti were written with marker pens on wallpaper, walls 
and cupboards. Mirrors were smashed, cupboard doors were ripped off and drapes 
and carpets were stained with dirt. 
</P>
<P>
About 55 students were arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor violations of 
trespassing and disturbing the peace, Hardman said. Arrested on suspicion of 
burglary and felony vandalism were Donald Melvin Clarke, 23, Joe Clark Murdoch, 
21, and Adalberto Munoz, 21. 
</P>
<P>
A few students were cited for operating a business without a license, Hardman 
said. He said he expects one more arrest to be made but said it is still being 
investigated. All of the students were released on bail or on their own 
recognizance, Hardman said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the students arrested was listed on the lease, and police did not know 
if any of the students had ever been tenants of the house, Hardman said. Police 
also did not know how many of the students arrested were from SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
Vestiges of the party also included swastikas scrawled on a wall, said Hardman, 
but he downplayed their significance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swastikas on Wall 
</P>
<P>
"There were indications that there were swastikas on the wall, but through the 
course of the investigation, I determined this is not a racially motivated or a 
race crime. It was just stupidity on the part of intoxicated students. The 
swastikas were not directed at any victims," Hardman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardman disputed reports that party-goers were also stamped with swastikas 
after paying the $2 admission. "Nobody had their hand stamped," he said. "They 
were marked with a marker pen to indicate they had paid. There were not 
swastikas. Band members, for instance, were marked with "B" to distinguish 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the house, Angela Balsamo, had some forewarning that a party was 
planned, Hardman said. "Someone turned in a flyer to SDSU authorities before 
the party. SDSU detectives contacted the owner. The owner checked the property 
at 6:30 p.m., but the house was secure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feared Retaliation 
</P>
<P>
Police began to receive complaints between 9 and 9:30 that night about noise 
from the party. When police arrived, they called Balsamo, who later told police 
that she feared retaliation from the students, Hardman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardman said he will submit the case to the district attorney's office by 
Tuesday for consideration, adding that he hopes the culprits won't get off with 
just a slap on the wrist. "We're talking felony charges here. . . . These 
people's house was trashed. How would you feel if your house was trashed?"

Despite objections from people who live across the Long Beach Freeway from the 
proposed site of a court building for abused and neglected children, the 
Monterey Park City Council has approved selling the land to Los Angeles County 
for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The hilltop site, next to the Sybil Brand Institute, the county women's jail, 
will house the county Dependency Court. Fire inspectors and a grand jury have 
said the court's current facilities, in downtown Los Angeles, are overcrowded 
to the point of being unsafe.

only need a faulty memory. 
</P>
<P>
State Controller Gray Davis on Thursday handed an accountant for a 91-year-old 
Hancock Park woman a check for $90,631, representing a savings account that she 
had apparently neglected. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that more than $41 million has been returned to about 77,000 
residents since passage of a law last year that requires financial institutions 
to turn over assets that have been inactive for five years. 
</P>
<P>
And Davis still has $460 million in unclaimed accounts on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"As incredible as it may sound, people lose track of money that belongs to 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis noted that the elderly woman was easy to locate because she had been 
living at the same address for a long time. "But frequently we don't have a 
current address," he added. "In those cases, the money can be returned if 
people call our toll-free number (800-992-4647)." 
</P>
<P>
Some recipients may not even be aware that they have an account. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a guy, a homeless guy, whose father left him a couple hundred thousand 
dollars and he didn't know it," said Dario Frommer, a spokesman for the 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
Other absent-minded types receiving forgotten money are Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner ($166) and actor Gene Hackman ($893). 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect commentary in this newspaper castigating the forgetful. 
</P>
<P>
Among the accounts that have not yet been processed, Davis said, is $2,979 
belonging to the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
A sighting in Cerritos of what was initially reported as a stolen cylinder of 
hazardous gas caused a brief closure of the Artesia Freeway. The object turned 
out to be a wrapper for French bread, the Los Angeles County Fire Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think society -- and the press -- is changing, consider that the 
Greater Los Angeles Press Club no longer has a bar. 
</P>
<P>
The club went on the wagon last year when it migrated from its longtime 
headquarters in a converted theater on Vermont Avenue to the Burbank Equestrian 
Center (sparking jokes about the common products of horses, reporters and 
publicists). 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a decline in business for the club, which rents space for 
news conferences at $100 per half-hour. But Executive Director Jim Foy cites 
non-alcohol-related reasons, including confusion over its whereabouts, the 
profusion of fax machines and the trend toward having news conferences in the 
field for better "visuals." However, Press Club membership has increased. 
</P>
<P>
The club, which also sponsors several events, including an awards banquet at 
the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on March 31, hopes to move into Hollywood later this 
year but won't have a bar there, either, because it plans to seek status as a 
charitable institution. 
</P>
<P>
A new home would be at least the sixth for the club. Sketchy records show that 
as long ago as 1916 members honored President Woodrow Wilson's secretary of the 
Navy at the Alexandria Hotel in a banquet hall made up like a ship. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter of the time hinted at previous organizing attempts when he noted 
that membership was small that year because "of the disastrous histories of 
previous press clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Corned Beef Alert: 
</P>
<P>
Though Catholics are observing Lent -- a period when they're obliged to abstain 
from eating meat on Fridays as a sign of penance -- the Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles has granted them "a dispensation from abstinence" today in honor of St. 
Patrick.

ESCONDIDO SCHOOL TRUCE PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hope faded Thursday for opening a new Escondido elementary school in the fall 
as the City Council added conditions to an agreement under which it would drop 
its legal action against the Escondido Union Elementary School District. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiated truce, arrived at Monday by a team of city and school district 
officials, was amended by the council in closed session Wednesday night. School 
trustees, also meeting in private, received the city's reply and made a 
counteroffer, which has not yet been discussed by the council. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the city is seeking a pledge from the school board that the new 
school next to Kit Carson Park -- and all future schools -- not be opened until 
all off-site improvements are in place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Streets Won't Be Finished 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school district's trustees seek to open the new 600-student 
facility by September. Improvements to the nearby streets cannot not be 
completed until November, according to city Public Works Director Dennis 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council filed suit last month to halt the grade-school construction 
until an environmental study and traffic report are completed. 
</P>
<P>
Under a negotiated agreement reached Monday between two council members, Mayor 
Doris Thurston and Councilman Jerry Harmon, and two board trustees, Board 
President James E. Lund and Sidney Hollins, the district agreed to pay for 
about $250,000 of the off-site improvements at the L. R. Green School at Las 
Posas Avenue and Bear Valley Parkway in return for the city's dropping its 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
School officials protested that the city was interfering with the district's 
commitment to provide quality education by delaying the school. Crowding in the 
district's schools has been underscored in recent weeks by the erection of 
signs on a number of grade-school campuses warning that enrollees might be 
forced to go to a school outside their attendance area because of crowded 
classrooms. Three schools already have been closed to all new enrollees because 
of crowding. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thurston defended the city's stance as necessary. School officials may be 
committed to providing quality education, she said, but the city is responsible 
for providing a safe environment for its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the Green school before street and traffic lights, sidewalks, turn 
lanes and other traffic-safety measures are finished would not be responsible, 
she said.

Early darkness during the fall means that students may be waiting for a bus to 
arrive after dusk, "and I, for one, don't want them placed in an unsafe 
environment" of unfinished sidewalks or bulldozers and other equipment 
obscuring motorists' views, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the elementary district has built schools without consulting the 
city and without participating in the costs of widening streets and other 
off-site improvements required for the safety of the students, Thurston said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said she plans to ask the City Council next week to initiate a task 
force of school and city officials to allow for coordinated planning at future 
school sites. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Sterling, an attorney and spokesman for the district's grade-school 
parents, said trustees resent the "laundry list" of improvements the city is 
demanding, some of which have no connection with traffic safety. Sterling said 
parents had appeared before the school board and City Council in an attempt to 
reach a compromise that would allow the school to open at the start of the fall 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Parent pressure led to the Monday conference at which the proposed agreement 
was fashioned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Interim City Manager Ray Blair said Thursday that the school district's latest 
counteroffer has been received by the city, but that no meeting time for City 
Council consideration of the document has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Harmon was out of the city Thursday, and another council member was 
expected to be unavailable over the weekend, meaning that next week is the 
earliest a special council meeting can be held. The council routinely meets at 
8 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Hollins said he is still optimistic that a settlement of the dispute 
will be reached, so that the district can move ahead with construction of the 
much-needed school. 
</P>
<P>
Hollins said the district now has 3,000 students in temporary classrooms and 
expects 1,200 to 1,400 more in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We need about four new schools right now," he said.

<P>
It strikes me that Rabbis Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper have somehow lost 
touch with reality in their column "U.S. Should Urge Arabs to Reverse 1975 
Stand" (Op-Ed Page, March 7). 
</P>
<P>
Once more, these hard-line Zionists are demanding another exercise in words 
from Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat to rescind the 
statement that "Zionism is racism." How many more "I yield" word games must the 
Zionists demand of the Palestinians before they sit down and discuss peace with 
them? 
</P>
<P>
This hit home when I read "Arab Dies in Shin Bet Interrogation Cell" (Part I) 
in the same issue, reporting yet another death by beating of a Palestinian 
during a three-day interrogation he underwent by the Israeli Shin Bet security 
services. This is simply one more in a series of beating, choking and 
"mysterious" deaths of Palestinians under interrogation by the Shin Bet to be 
added to a U.S. State Department assessment of Israeli human rights violations 
against Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Jews were beaten, tortured and gassed to death by Nazis simply because they 
were Jews. Blacks are beaten, shot and tortured to death by whites in South 
Africa simply because they are black. Palestinians are beaten, tortured and 
tear-gassed and shot to death by Zionist Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza 
simply because they are Palestinian Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
All three sound like racism to me. What is the exception, Rabbis Hier and 
Cooper?

WE MUST BEGIN NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOTE: In a recent letter to The Times, Gov. George Deukmejian complained that 
this newspaper frequently proposes new programs without saying where it would 
get the money to pay for them. In this third and final editorial response, The 
Times proposes specific additions to the governor's 1989-90 budget and the tax 
increases needed to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the problems confronting California, the state's most urgent needs can 
be met without a burdensome increase in taxes. The cuts and omissions in Gov. 
Deukmejian's $46-billion budget for 1989-90 could be restored with about $1.3 
billion more in general fund revenue. 
</P>
<P>
This money will not make up for the spending shortfalls of past years, but it 
would lift California from the budget hole that has made planning for the 
state's future impossible. Californians still would be taxed less than 
residents in most other major industrial states and far less than they were 
before the state began providing $115 billion in cumulative reductions 
beginning in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
California also must develop a coordinated strategy for managing growth and 
must plan the public works required to make such a strategy realistic. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate problem, however, is the 1989-90 budget. Here is our plan: 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION 
</P>
<P>
The 1989-90 budget contains a shortfall of nearly $700 million in state highway 
construction and maintenance, growing to $4.5 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
California should raise its gasoline tax -- dedicated entirely to highways and 
other transportation uses -- from the present 9 cents a gallon to 19 cents, 
yielding an additional $15 billion to $20 billion over the next decade. The new 
tax would cost the average motorist an estimated $63 a year, but poorly 
maintained roads and time lost in traffic jams are said to cost $122 for every 
California driver annually. 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION 
</P>
<P>
For kindergarten through 12th grade, an additional $160 million for class-size 
reductions and $37 million for teachers' continuing education and staff 
development. For higher education, $24 million for operating funds at the 
California State University, $19 million in student aid, $140 million for 
community college reforms and $32 million to reverse a 10% fee increase at the 
University of California and CSU. Total $412 million. 
</P>
<P>
MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
Restore proposed elimination of $272 million in cost-of-living increases in 
Medi-Cal; county health services; supplemental income for the aged, blind, 
elderly and disabled and welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Also, $132 million for mental health; $65 million for the new workfare program; 
$36 million for the Office of Family Planning; $6 million for in-home services 
for the elderly; $81 million for Medi-Cal case load and other factors, and $259 
million for health services for the poor and county hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
REVENUE 
</P>
<P>
Support legislation by Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) to restore, on taxable 
incomes of $100,000 and more, the top state personal income tax bracket of 11%, 
reduced to 9.3% by the 1987 state tax reform act. This raises about $600 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Replenish the state's depleted reserve fund over several years rather than all 
at once as proposed by Deukmejian for a one-time savings of about $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
Adopt legislation to further conform state tax law to federal tax statutes, 
about $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other reasonable methods of raising additional revenue, if needed, would be to 
eliminate some exemptions from the state sales and use tax, a potential $2 
billion; partially restore the inheritance tax with a threshold that would not 
affect children taking over family homes, farms and small businesses; scale 
back the full indexing of personal income taxes to a percentage of inflation; 
tax services such as fees charged by lawyers; create a split roll in the 
property tax so that businesses would pay at a higher level than homeowners, 
and raise the tax on alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
None of this money could be spent as long as the Gann spending limit, which 
restricts government growth to a formula based on inflation and population 
increases, remains in state law (although there can be a one-year emergency 
overrun). The Gann limits should be abolished. If that is not possible now, the 
formula by which the ceilings are calculated should be changed to reflect the 
faster real growth of key cost factors such as school and prison populations 
and the cost of health care. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13, which faces potentially crippling court challenges, must be 
revised in a manner that retains a reasonable limit on property tax increases 
-- especially for those on fixed incomes -- but eliminates some of the 
inequities created by the poorly drafted 1978 initiative. The tax on a newly 
purchased home can be as much as 10 times the levy on a similar house next door 
that has not changed ownership for some time. Also, since businesses change 
ownership less frequently, homeowners have assumed a far greater proportion of 
the total property tax -- and businesses less -- than in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 also should be stripped of provisions requiring a two-thirds 
vote of the Legislature to raise state taxes and a referendum by the people to 
increase local revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the anti-tax crusade triggered by Proposition 13 were 
understandable at the time. But the unintended consequences could not be 
foreseen: the granting of billions in tax relief to Californians and the 
shrinking of the tax base to the point that it no longer will finance the 
state's most urgent needs. This problem will not fix itself. Much political 
leadership and courage is required to get California back on the road to a 
productive future. The journey must begin now.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: OLD COLUMBIA IS ACTUALLY NEW AND THRIVES ON BREW 
OF ITS OWN MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Downtown San Diego's Old Columbia Brewery &amp; Grill, the city's first "pub 
brewery," actually looks like it should. 
</P>
<P>
Neither cute nor suburban, the long room stretches back under a barrel-vaulted 
ceiling, the brick walls and utilitarian furniture giving it the appearance of 
a late Victorian warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
On the right side of the room, the salient features are the highly polished 
brew kettles and beer tanks that squat behind plate-glass windows, and the bar 
that runs in front of them. Although the place opened just a month ago, 
sundowns find the bar jammed with patrons, most of them locked in conversation 
and downing brews with names like Gaslamp Gold and Old Columbia Amber Lager. 
The sight of so many people enjoying themselves is a real pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Old Columbia (which of course is new, not old) joins a group of about 75 
independent microbreweries that have sprung up recently across the country; the 
idea actually is a rejuvenation of the old-fashioned practice of brewing in 
small batches for consumption on the premises. Old Columbia intends to produce 
about 46,500 gallons annually, an amount unlikely to put Miller Brewing Co. or 
Anheuser-Busch over a barrel when it comes to competing for the American beer 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Essential Element 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who value flavor in beer -- an essential element that gradually has 
vanished as major brewers have cut back on hops content and have introduced 
watered-down "light" beers -- will not only applaud Old Columbia, but will 
cheerfully look forward to two more microbreweries expected to open in the 
county later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Old Columbia features "handmade" beers brewed according to recipes developed by 
Karl Strauss, retired brewmaster of the Pabst Brewing Co. and uncle of Old 
Columbia partner Christopher Cramer. Two -- a golden ale and a lager -- have 
been available recently, but plans call for the introduction of other types. 
</P>
<P>
Critiquing a beer is not the easiest task. But consider Gaslamp Gold a beer of 
pronounced but mellow bitterness, with a strong finish and a rich, chewy body. 
The Amber Lager similarly is full and rich, but heavier, and is rather 
challenging to taste buds accustomed to more weak-kneed brews; it stands well 
on its own or as an accompaniment to strongly flavored or highly seasoned 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
Food is a very strong element of the business at Old Columbia, but now it seems 
mostly an adjunct to the business of brewing and serving beer. The menu runs to 
some length and is well-designed as an accompaniment to the house brews, but 
the execution, by and large, is shaky. In truth, the one dish that really stood 
out among the many sampled on two recent visits was a dessert called "chocolate 
on tap," a fudge brownie buried at the bottom of a goblet under vanilla ice 
cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
This dessert, of course, is not a dish meant to accompany beer. Among those 
designed for that purpose, the best bets are the beer-battered onion rings and 
the fish and chips. The batter used both for the onions and the fish is yeasty 
and perfumed with the beer that gives it its essence, and it puffs to a 
wonderful crispness in the deep fat. 
</P>
<P>
The onion rings can start a meal; another happy starter that could double as a 
light entree is the sausage and cheese platter that pairs triangles of Jack and 
Cheddar with slices of cold bratwurst. French fries also are listed in the 
appetizer category, both plain or in a plethora of guises that include spuds 
draped with melted cheese, drowned in chili and, for die-hards, buried beneath 
slatherings of both. 
</P>
<P>
The chili could have been hotter in temperature when sampled, but spice-wise, 
it made the mark. Leaning more heavily on minced beef than on beans, this one 
had a good tomato base and a relatively deep flavor, and was garnished on the 
side with chopped onions for those who don't know when to quit. The menu also 
offers baked onion soup and a soup of the day, which recently was a "seafood 
bisque" of uncertain parentage that seemed like nothing so much as thickened 
clam juice garnished with a few snippets of shellfish. It was eminently 
forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
Some entree-sized salads include beer in their dressings. The Cobb instead is 
moistened with a Champagne vinaigrette, which may be its best feature. This 
salad, to be correct, must be chopped, but the greens were in too large pieces; 
the worst part was the cubed chicken, which had been grilled over charcoal and 
had a strong, smoky flavor that fought all the other elements. Other choices in 
this department include Caesar, chef and vegetable salads. 
</P>
<P>
Among heartier items, the meaty short ribs were interesting, not so much for 
their flavor (the menu claimed they were marinated in a "secret blend of herbs 
and spices," a secret that must have been guarded from the cooks), but for 
their texture, which resembled that of a properly done pot roast. A hamburger 
(there are several varieties) was plump, but not particularly juicy or notable 
in other ways, except for the creamy, dill-flavored potato salad that 
accompanied it. The "Brewmaster" sandwich was much more interesting; it layered 
thinly sliced roast beef with Jack cheese and sliced chilies on a toasted roll, 
and made a hearty, savory meal. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Old Columbia offers a good selection of California wines by the 
bottle and glass, and at prices that should make many San Diego restaurants 
blush. But the real interest here is the product that flows from the shiny vats 
in the back room, and San Diegans who like a decent beer should find that Old 
Columbia's offerings have vintage qualities of their own.

ISRAEL AND THE PLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel William's article "Children of the Intifada: 'Our battle' " (Part I, 
Feb. 18) poses a serious problem both to Arabs and Israelis alike. Yet the 
solution in itself is not that hard to envision. While those children have 
accomplished more than all their ancestors and the combined Arab armies in 
gaining sympathy to the Palestinian cause, there remains one problem that must 
be coped with once these children accomplish their goals: There remains the 
effect of 20 years of Israeli occupation during which they eyewitnessed and 
lived the ugly scenes of police brutality, army beatings, arrests, house 
demolitions, the killing of their relatives, not only by the hands of the 
Israeli Army but also Jewish settlers, who have assumed the role of God in the 
region and claimed the whole area as theirs. 
</P>
<P>
These children have reached the stage where parental authority in their view is 
meaningless if not ceremonial. The parents of these children realize the 
importance of their accomplishments. They are willing to lose parental 
authority in favor of freedom and dignity. This is really a small price to pay 
considering the trade-off. But what does the future hold for these heroes? Will 
the nightmare end for them? Will the ugly images disappear from their minds? Or 
will it leave scars of fear, hatred, and revenge? 
</P>
<P>
It will behoove today's psychologists to stop wondering what they can do to 
make it easier on the Israeli soldiers to continue in their role as occupiers, 
and instead concentrate on finding solutions to the future of these children. 
The cycle of hate has to stop in the Middle East. If not for our sake, then for 
the sake of the next generation, Arabs and Israelis, alike. Each deserves to 
live in a society void of violence and above all hate. Genuine peace can be 
achieved through an end to the occupation.

HEALTH REQUIRES THAT WE REPLACE GASOLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMUEL S. EPSTEIN, Samuel S. Epstein, MD, is a professor of occupational and 
environmental medicine at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at 
Chicago. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With today's vote of the South Coast Air Quality Management District on its 
20-year plan, and in light of new federal regulations on ozone-related gasoline 
volatility, the time for tough, fundamental decisions on motor fuels is long 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively low retail price charged the U.S. taxpayer for gasoline totally 
fails to reflect its hidden costs. Apart from the strategic and security costs 
of dependence on foreign imports, the environmental and public-health costs are 
prohibitive. These include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The contribution of gasoline combustion to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spills from offshore and tundra drilling and marine accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Contamination of surface and ground waters by drilling muds, hazardous 
refinery wastes and effluents and leaking storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leukemia and brain and other cancers in refinery workers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Atmospheric emissions from refineries responsible for cancers in 
neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Emissions from the gasoline distribution system and vehicle refueling, 
evaporative and exhaust emissions producing carcinogen-laced urban smog 
responsible for cancer as well as heightened respiratory and cardiovascular 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline is more dangerous than ever. With the phase-out of lead additives, the 
aromatic content of gasoline has doubled, particularly in super premium (93 
octane) gasoline. The principal aromatic hydrocarbons -- benzene, toluene and 
xylene -- make up more than 40% of gasoline. Benzene is also produced by 
combustion of aromatic hydrocarbons even in benzene-free gasoline. 
Automobile-related emissions are responsible for 85% of the increasing national 
benzene emissions, about 130,000 tons per year. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are now routinely exposed to 1 part per million (p.p.m.) benzene 
during full-service gasoline refueling, and 3 p.p.m. at self-serve pumps. This 
exceeds the 1 p.p.m. exposure standard above which the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration requires that workers be warned and protected. Based on 
inhalation tests in rodents, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated in 
1984 that the probability of developing cancer following lifetime exposure to 1 
p.p.m. benzene or gasoline is about 1% and 0.1%, respectively. The Senate 
Environment and Public Works Committee recently concluded that exposure to such 
levels is responsible for about 220 extra cancers per year in the Los Angeles 
Basin alone. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the excess risk of leukemia and cancer, Dow Chemical Co. in 1980 
reported genetic damage in workers exposed to only 1 p.p.m. benzene. It is the 
overwhelming consensus of the independent scientific community that there is no 
way of setting safe exposure levels or tolerances to any chemical agent such as 
benzene that can induce genetic damage or cancer. It is clear that gasoline, in 
all phases of production, use and disposal, is a major source of environmental 
and occupational carcinogens and preventable cancers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 the American Petroleum Institute identified a new class of carcinogens 
in gasoline even more potent than benzene. Long-term inhalation of unleaded 
gasoline by rodents induced liver and kidney cancers that were associated with 
isoalkanes in gasoline. The significance of these findings, which API initially 
suppressed and subsequently trivialized, is underscored by the 142% increase in 
kidney cancer in American males from 1950-1985. 
</P>
<P>
Aromatic hydrocarbons, especially xylene, also contribute to the formation of 
the urban ozone soup, a major cause of respiratory disease, particularly in the 
young and elderly. Ozone is formed when volatile organic compounds react in the 
presence of heat and sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Are these problems the price we must pay for efficient transportation and 
progress? Despite industry propaganda, few modern automobiles need 93 octane 
gasolines, costing 10 to 20 cents per gallon more than regular (87 octane) 
unleaded. The bottom line: The petroleum industry sells gasolines we don't need 
that are slowly killing us and destroying the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Economical and safer alternatives to gasoline are readily available. 
EPA-approved alcohol and ether fuels can replace aromatics and improve octane 
in our cars with little adverse effect on human health or the environment. 
Eventually, these fuels could completely replace gasoline. Fuel ethanol, used 
in Brazil for years, has been sold in this country as "gasohol," 10% 
agriculturally derived ethanol and 90% gasoline. Despite the petroleum 
industry's claims that ethanol and methanol are too expensive, compared to the 
retail and hidden price we pay for gasoline, these fuels are a true bargain. 
</P>
<P>
The problem lies in the petroleum industry's resistance to fuels not produced 
from a barrel of crude oil. Much of today's petroleum industry is free-ranging 
and multinational, indifferent to the security interests of their customer 
nations, especially when supplies are cheaper elsewhere. Yet, according to the 
National Security Defense Council Foundation, the petroleum industry expected 
U.S. taxpayers to ante up an extra $36.25 to defend every barrel of oil that 
came out of the Persian Gulf, a cost never included in the price of gasoline at 
the pump. On an annual basis, this totaled $14.7 billion or roughly the annual 
budget of U.S. Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
These true externalized costs of gasoline must be reflected in tough 
legislation and incentives for the expanded use of safer, clean-burning fuels, 
coupled with draconian penalties on "dirty" fuels. Such measures would improve 
public health, enhance air quality, reduce dependence on foreign oil, boost 
U.S. agriculture and reduce the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In the last analysis, the multinational petroleum industry is a reckless 
corporate citizen that holds the world at ransom. Time and again, when a choice 
between profit and human health or the environment or national security must be 
made, the industry will choose profit every time. The expeditious phase-out of 
runaway petroleum technologies and ultra-hazardous, obsolete, gasoline fuels 
must become an immediate national priority.

CLOSING A TRAILER PARK CAN MEAN HARDSHIP FOR TENANTS 
</P>

Orine Noble and Lillie Fox have been friends and neighbors for 18 years, living 
modestly on opposite sides of a quiet and shady trailer park they have come to 
think of as home. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us have been here even longer, more than 20 years, so it's hard," said 
Noble, 73, as she pondered what to do when the Carson-area park closes in 
October, making way for condominiums whose construction the county approved 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, also 73, had always thought her small trailer "would last me until I 
passed on." But now she is trying to come to grips with moving. "We sure are 
going to miss it, because we made so many friends here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the uprooting of Noble, Fox and their neighbors in the Pleasant View 
Mobile Park involves not only lost friendships but, for many of them, economic 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Immigrant Families 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the trailer park, just north of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center on Vermont 
Avenue, say they will help tenants find new places to live. 
</P>
<P>
But several of the park's 130 residents, who include many senior citizens and 
immigrant families, say they don't know where they can afford to go. Aging 
trailers -- often their only asset -- are not welcome at other mobile home 
parks. And they cannot afford apartment rents, which are at least double the 
$200 a month many now pay to rent spaces in the trailer park, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Noble, for example, pays $280 of her $602 monthly income for rent and 
utilities. "I can't pay $400 or $500 a month." she said. "I have medicine I 
have to pay for. I have insurance (to pay for). I pay my rent. I've never 
missed a payment." 
</P>
<P>
The situation at Pleasant View Mobile Park, typical of many others in which 
trailer parks have been squeezed out of communities throughout Los Angeles 
County, was considered briefly on Thursday by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In allowing 66 condominiums to replace 68 trailer spaces, Supervisor Ed Edelman 
told developers that he hoped they would "not only follow the law, but do as 
much as possible financially" to help relocate park tenants. 
</P>
<P>
State law is vague about relocation benefits, saying only that local 
governments may require payments to displaced tenants that do not "exceed the 
reasonable costs of relocation." Though the law was passed in June, 1986, Los 
Angeles County, like many other local jurisdictions, has not yet adopted 
guidelines that describe which costs are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves residents at Pleasant View and at the declining number of other 
trailer parks countywide to wonder what their rights are. 
</P>
<P>
Old trailer parks -- often replaced by more profitable hotels, shopping centers 
and condominiums -- have been closed in recent years in Torrance, Hawthorne, 
Lomita, Carson and Lennox. Parks are also closing in several San Gabriel Valley 
cities, the inner city of Los Angeles and in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
State housing officials reported last month that the number of mobile home 
parks in Los Angeles County had dropped from 770 in 1986 to 740. Although that 
figure indicates some stability, officials said, it reflects both the growth of 
modern, higher-rent parks in suburban areas and the decline of older parks 
occupied by low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these are small parks where the land value has gone up excessively 
and they've been closed down for new development," said Julie Stewart, 
spokeswoman for the state housing department. 
</P>
<P>
Although some cities and counties have clarified the state law with their own 
regulations, they are in the minority and many parks have been closed with 
scant government review, said attorney Kenneth H. Carlson, who has represented 
residents in several parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drafting Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
After prodding by Supervisor Mike Antonovich last September, the county began 
drafting guidelines that officials say could be presented to the supervisors 
for approval by May. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Kawczynski, who is overseeing that process, said the guidelines probably 
will require park owners to pay tenants the actual cost of moving, some 
compensation for loss of their trailers and a rent subsidy to enable them to 
get into an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Though those guidelines should be in place when Pleasant View is closed in 
October, about a dozen tenants interviewed last week said they had heard 
nothing from the owners about the possibility of cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been nothing about what they're going to give us, if they're going to 
give us anything," said 84-year-old Mary O'Brien, a resident of the park for 22 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Noble said she has asked John Vann Jr., who owns the park with his two sisters, 
about relocation. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I'll promise you this, I'll try to take care of you,' " Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Vann said it is not clear how much assistance the 
county will require him to provide. In an initial attempt to determine 
reasonable relocation benefits, Vann said he met with a county official last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked him what his guidelines were, and he said he had none," Vann said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Vann said, he has offered to find tenants places to move and he expects 
to provide financial assistance in some cases. He will also solicit bids for 
trailers that are so old they would not be acceptable to other parks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people who've been there a long time, and we feel a concern for those 
people," said co-owner Linda Hills. "We feel an obligation." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we do will have the county's approval," Vann said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to make this as easy for them as possible," he said. "The senior 
citizens are our greatest concern." 
</P>
<P>
The county Housing Authority plans to work with Pleasant View park owners to 
move displaced tenants into public housing or enroll them in government 
rent-subsidy programs, Kawczynski said. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant lawyer Carlson said that residents displaced from parks in 
unincorporated areas can now expect aggressive support from the county, even 
without the new guidelines being formally adopted. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent case, for example, more than 20 trailer owners in an east 
Pasadena park each turned down a $1,500 offer from the owner. Eventually, with 
county support, they negotiated a payment of $6,000 each, plus the choice of 
selling their trailers or moving them to an adjacent parcel. 
</P>
<P>
"The county made it clear that they were not going to stand by as these people 
were made homeless simply because the owner had found a more profitable use for 
the site," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the legality of an ordinance in Carson, which requires park owners to 
buy trailers at their in-park values when residents are displaced, is being 
challenged in court by a park owner as an unreasonable relocation benefit.

SPRING BREAK WITHOUT EASTER IRKS L.A. PARENTS 
</P>

<P>
A group of parents angry that spring vacation this year begins two weeks after 
Easter Sunday staged protests Thursday against the Los Angeles Unified School 
District at a Sun Valley elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
"We as Christians are fighting the change," said John Barnwell, a parent who 
organized the protest at Vinedale Elementary School. "Most people who believe 
in God believe that this is the most important week in Christian history." 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, the weeklong vacation preceded Easter. 
</P>
<P>
Barnwell and a dozen other parents and children carried signs and passed out 
literature urging parents to keep their children home during Easter week, which 
this year begins Sunday. Vacation for the district's 592,000 students begins 
April 10. 
</P>
<P>
The school board, in an agreement reached with the Los Angeles teachers union 
last year, scheduled spring vacation to begin halfway through the 20-week 
semester. Easter falls on a Sunday within a 35-day period between March 22 and 
April 25 each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that is most educationally sound," Don Schrack, a spokesman for the 
United Teachers-Los Angeles, said of the schedule change. He added that 
teachers also like the change because it comes midway through the semester. 
</P>
<P>
But Barnwell said most parents still do not know about the change this year, 
even though schools routinely send home vacation schedules in the fall. Having 
the vacation separate from the traditional Easter week makes worship more 
difficult and creates a problem for families planning vacations at that time, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never tell anyone what to believe in," said Kris Tine, who has two 
children in Los Angeles schools. "But they're trying to take the Lord away from 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Roberta Weintraub said she supports returning spring vacation 
to Easter week, even though she voted for the master calendar last year that 
included the change. 
</P>
<P>
Although the spring break next year will, by coincidence, fall during the 
traditional Easter week, Weintraub said she will push to have the traditional 
vacation period in future years. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank and Glendale school districts will have their spring vacations during 
Easter week, officials said.

GRADUATION MOVED FROM 7 TO 11 A.M.; 
</P>
<P>
CSUN RELENTS; TO LET CLASS OF '89 SLEEP IN 
</P>

For graduating seniors at Cal State Northridge, the first day of the rest of 
their lives will start a little later. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to complaints from students and parents, the university said 
Thursday that it will change the start of spring graduation ceremonies May 26 
from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN administrators announced the 7 a.m. start time last month, saying the 
early hour would avoid high temperatures and be symbolic of a new beginning for 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"We had thought that the students would be excited about it," university 
spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said. "That didn't happen . . . . You have to listen 
to what the students want." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 4,650 graduating students and their parents complained to 
university officials that they would have to awake before dawn to attend the 
ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Kuklensky, managing editor of the Daily Sundial, the campus newspaper, 
said most letters to the editor on the subject opposed the 7 a.m. start. She 
said many students charged that the early hour was an attempt to curtail 
drinking and rowdiness, but Salisbury denied that was the purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The university decided to hold the event at the Bowl because construction has 
closed the grassy area in front of Oviatt Library, where graduation ceremonies 
usually take place. 
</P>
<P>
Some students also have complained about plans to limit the number of relatives 
and friends that can be invited to the Bowl, which holds fewer people than the 
campus graduation site. Salisbury said Thursday that most students will be 
limited to four tickets each, but some may be given more if other students 
order less than four. 
</P>
<P>
The Bowl has 17,960 seats and 3,500 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury said the Bowl's design will not permit students to march on stage to 
receive their diplomas, as has been done in ceremonies on campus. But 
administrators hope that a way can be found for university President James W. 
Cleary to individually recognize each student, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never anyone's hope that students wouldn't get this recognition," she 
said.

MOBIL SEES LITTLE RISK IN ACID USE AT REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study released Thursday by Mobil Oil Corp. has concluded that continued use 
of acutely toxic hydrofluoric acid at the Torrance refinery poses almost no 
risk to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive risk assessment prepared for the city of Torrance by a team 
of consultants concluded that there is less than a 1% chance per year of a 
single death occurring in the community from use of the lethal acid. 
</P>
<P>
Expressed another way, the study said the overall risk posed by hydrofluoric 
acid -- which is used to boost the octane of unleaded gasoline -- is 1.21 
fatalities per 100 years. By contrast, an average of 15 people die each year in 
automobile accidents in Torrance, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not worth losing sleep over," Mobil refinery manager Wyman D. 
Robb told reporters. "The risk is reasonable. . . . I would hope the public 
would be reassured that Mobil is doing everything we can to minimize the risk." 
</P>
<P>
But Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker, author of a proposed ballot initiative 
aimed at forcing Mobil to stop using hydrofluoric acid in the city, immediately 
dismissed the consultants' findings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Credibility' 
</P>
<P>
"When Mobil says that Mobil's plant is safe, that has . . . no credibility," 
Walker said in an interview. "Of course it says not to worry." 
</P>
<P>
Walker vowed to go forward with his initiative, saying safety equipment is 
susceptible to human error. "Machines break down, computers malfunction, people 
malfunction. You have a hazard that is too large for this community." 
</P>
<P>
And he criticized those who minimize the risk. "I don't see the plant manager 
living across the street from the refinery or having his family there," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An excess of hydrofluoric acid in a unit at the Torrance refinery caused a 
thunderous explosion Nov. 24, 1987, and sparked a spectacular fire that burned 
for two days. Concern about use of the chemical has grown in the aftermath of 
the blast and a series of smaller explosions, fires and accidents in other 
parts of the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Most other refineries in the South Bay use less-toxic sulfuric acid as a 
catalyst to boost octane. Mobil has estimated that it would cost $100 million 
to convert the Torrance facility to sulfuric acid. Robb said Thursday that the 
company has spent $3 million on studies to see if some other catalyst could be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requested by City 
</P>
<P>
The $275,000 risk management and prevention program was produced by Technica 
Inc. and Stone &amp; Webster Environmental Services. The study, paid for by 
Mobil, was requested a year ago by the Torrance Fire Department under 
provisions of a state law governing acutely toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance City Council will decide next week whether to hire a San 
Diego-based consultant to determine the adequacy of Mobil's risk assessment. 
Additional work may be required if the city finds that the study is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
The study contains 19 pages of recommendations for improving safety systems to 
minimize the risk of an accident involving hydrofluoric acid, which can produce 
a ground-hugging vapor cloud that, in sufficient quantities, is deadly to 
people exposed within five miles downwind. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said the company will follow the report's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the risk is relatively low," Robb said, "Mobil is not happy with 
any risk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emergency Tank 
</P>
<P>
The improvements include installation by 1991 of a $6-million acid evacuation 
system that would drain the lethal chemical to a storage tank in an emergency. 
Robb said the system would "substantially lessen risk of a large release 
impacting on the community." 
</P>
<P>
Other improvements will include better training, safety equipment and alarm 
systems. Altogether, the work will slash the danger to 0.15 fatalities per 100 
years, the study said. (Those figures are for the general public and do not 
include the risk to Mobil employees.) 
</P>
<P>
Robb said the oil industry was surprised by results of tests conducted in the 
Nevada desert in 1986 and 1987. The tests found that hydrofluoric acid was more 
dangerous than previously thought because when released it forms a heavy vapor 
that does not disperse readily. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has contacted Torrance Fire Chief Scott Adams about preparing 
emergency plans in the event of an accident involving release of the acid. 
</P>
<P>
"The risks are very, very low," Robb said. "Nevertheless, you want to be ready 
if something does happen. . . . We should think about what are the best things 
to do if there is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil did not release data on more than 700 accident scenarios that the 
consultants studied, all involving releases of various amounts of hydrofluoric 
acid. Krishna S. Mudan, vice president of Technica Inc., said the consultants 
analyzed the impact of different weather, wind speeds and wind direction. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said that releasing maps showing hypothetical vapor plumes over 
residential areas would scare people. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants acknowledged that they did not conduct studies to predict what 
would happen in the event of a major earthquake. Robb said the alkylation unit 
where hydrofluoric acid is used was built to Torrance building codes and 
therefore such a study was not required. 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Myers, environmental program manager for Stone &amp; Webster 
Environmental Services, the other firm that worked on the Mobil study, said the 
hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit is in excellent condition after being largely 
rebuilt in 1987 and 1988.

UNSAFE BUILDING EVACUATED; 
</P>
<P>
APARTMENTS' OWNER TO BE CHARGED 
</P>

<P>
The owner of a Burbank apartment building, whose residents were forced to 
evacuate by the city, will be charged with violating building and fire-safety 
standards, a city official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 residents, including families with children, were moved to a nearby 
motel late Wednesday by a city temporary-aid agency, and the building was 
ordered closed by Burbank building and fire authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Mary Reilly said misdemeanor charges will be filed today 
against landlord George Jenkins, 40, of Agoura Hills. It had not been 
determined late Thursday how many counts would be leveled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins has refused to repair dangerous conditions at the two-story building at 
223 E. Santa Anita Ave. for at least a 1 1/2 years, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-unit building, in which seven apartments were occupied, has been cited 
for numerous violations, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins denied the allegations Thursday, saying the repairs have been delayed 
because the city refuses to lend him funds to bring the building up to 
standards. The city, however, says he is ineligible for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents, who paid $225 a month for their apartments, were 
unemployed or had no money, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
"Children were playing under live wires that were dangling from the ceilings," 
Reilly said. "There were extension cords all over the place, leading from 
hallway outlets to the apartments. The fire exits were blocked on the first 
floor. Desks were piled in front of them, and there was no way anyone could 
have gotten out." 
</P>
<P>
Other violations include inadequate wiring and plumbing, broken windows, 
deteriorating walls and ceilings and the absence of fire extinguishers and 
smoke detectors, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Flores, an unemployed worker who lived with his wife and three small 
children on the second floor of the building, said that his apartment had no 
electricity and that its windows were broken when he moved in six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any other place to go," said Flores, 25. "We had to live there. 
But everything was dirty. The sink was all backed up." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, who spent the afternoon at the apartment waiting for an electrical 
contractor, said he had negotiated with city housing officials for two years in 
an attempt to get a rehabilitation loan to repair the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a slumlord," Jenkins said. Since he has been unable to get help from 
city, he said he will spend $150,000 to refurbish the building and turn it into 
a rehabilitation facility for alcoholics and drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing my best, but the city certainly could have handled it better," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins added that he will reimburse the city for housing tenants in the motel 
and that he plans to meet with tenants today to work out further housing 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Malzek, Burbank's assistant community development director and housing 
administrator, said Jenkins is ineligible for a city loan because the repairs 
needed would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
She said the city could only assist property owners in cases where the loan 
would be less than 80% of the appraised value of the property. 
</P>
<P>
The building, which is almost 70 years old, was appraised last year by city 
officials as worth about $895,000. Jenkins asked for a $490,208 loan, but 
because he is still making payments on the property and the repair costs would 
exceed his request, the loan was denied, Malzek said.

BILTMORE SITE ISSUE OKD FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A petition calling for a vote on preserving Hermosa Beach's Biltmore site as 
open space has enough signatures to qualify for the November ballot, the county 
registrar-recorder's office confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The petition, which was circulated by community activist Parker Herriott, is 
the latest in a series of ballot proposals aimed at determining use of the 
city-owned parcel at 15th Street and The Strand. It has been vacant since the 
Biltmore hotel was torn down about 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
All of the past measures have been rejected by voters. Most city officials in 
recent years have advocated selling the Biltmore site and using the revenue to 
help overcome persistent budget shortages. 
</P>
<P>
The new petition "gives people, for the first time, a chance to vote on open 
space," said Herriott, an apartment building owner and actor. He collected 
1,880 signatures and 1,445 were verified when checked against county records of 
registered voters. To qualify, the petition needed 1,272 valid signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which recently appointed an 11-member citizens advisory 
committee to study possible uses of the Biltmore site, has the option of 
adopting Herriott's petition as an ordinance. Otherwise, the measure must be 
placed on the November ballot.

They're among the world's most famous works of art, and it would take an 
international trip to see them all. 
</P>
<P>
But through the illusion of painting, costumes, makeup and lighting -- and the 
willingness of some 40 people to hold perfectly still -- works by the likes of 
Da Vinci, Vermeer, Michelangelo and Raphael will be in one place on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula this weekend and next. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth annual Pageant of Our Lord, which opens tonight at the Rolling Hills 
Covenant Church, uses church members as live models to recreate 10 famous 
paintings or sculptures that touch on events in the life of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Between artworks, costumed actors portraying Lazarus -- the man Jesus raised 
from the dead -- and his sisters, Mary and Martha, recount their memories of 
Jesus. A 34-piece orchestra and a 120-voice choir provide a rich musical 
background, drawing extensively on Handel's "Messiah" but also including 
"Silent Night" and pieces especially composed for this year's pageant. 
</P>
<P>
"We do this as our unique way of presenting Easter," said David Halverson, 
minister of worship, music and drama at the church. "We started it because we 
thought it might attract people, and it did." 
</P>
<P>
The church, which has a 1,100-seat sanctuary, expects 6,000 people to see the 
pageant during its seven performances. It is open to everyone, not just church 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Though the artworks vary from year to year, Leonardo Da Vinci's "The Last 
Supper" is one of the most popular, according to Halverson and the pageant's 
artistic director, Rassie Harper. And one of the most spectacular is Thomas 
DeKeyser's "Crucifixion," in which three men are suspended 12 feet above the 
floor. This work comes complete with a crashing thunder-and-lightning effect. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a retired Gardena firefighter, said the pageant is a form of worship 
for the volunteer church members who put it on. "It is a wonderful way to use 
the talent God gave me and in turn, giving glory to Him, a way of giving 
thanks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Bostelaar, who lives on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, has portrayed Mary 
for the last two years in the "Pieta," the serene marble sculpture by 
Michelangelo of the crucified Jesus and his mother. "Last year during the 
performance, I got such an overwhelming feeling of sadness that I started to 
cry," she said. "I know how Mary must have felt." 
</P>
<P>
Bostelaar said being in the pageant again this year was very important to her 
after a diagnosis of breast cancer last August, followed by a mastectomy and 
chemotherapy. "I thought that it might be the last year," she said, adding with 
a smile that everything "looks good" now. 
</P>
<P>
If the pageant is a deepening of faith for the church members who paint the 
artworks, model, work backstage and provide the music, getting the whole thing 
ready for the public can have its light moments. 
</P>
<P>
During a rehearsal this week, one of the disciples wore a Hobie sweat shirt, 
and the Prodigal Son sported a blue T-shirt that proclaimed Action Tools. And 
the "Crucifixion" painting was missing a key member: Jesus. It seems that the 
man portraying him was outside and missed his cue. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Ibscher of Lawndale, who plays Nicodemus in the reproduction of a 
16th-Century bronze plaque, recalls that when a painting of Christ calming the 
waters was portrayed last year, one of the men who played a disciple wore a 
skipper's hat. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Pageant of the Masters in Laguna Beach was the model for this 
pageant, which strives to make every live work look identical to the original. 
In "The Last Supper," even the worn look of the fresco -- its cracks, chips and 
the doorway that was cut into it -- is captured. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, church artists have learned that even the great masters made 
mistakes about dimensions or deliberately distorted them. In "The Last Supper," 
Harper said, one of the disciples is extending a knife. But no one's arm could 
be that long, so the pageant model holds a stick attached to a foam-rubber hand 
and knife. 
</P>
<P>
Wood and cardboard are used to create depth, and stiff painted muslin serves as 
the backgrounds and clothing that cover the figures. In most instances, the 
live models fit themselves into the work by thrusting their heads or limbs 
through the background and blending into what has been painted. There are few 
full, costumed figures. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said lighting and makeup are key ingredients. The makeup, he said, "like 
painting . . . might change the mouth or make the cheekbone protruded or look 
sunken in." 
</P>
<P>
White body makeup and glycerin give the sheen of marble to the models in the 
"Pieta." It looks so real, Harper said, that "you'd expect the marble to crack 
if anybody moved." Gerald Faris

SOCKERS' CROW REMAINS SERIOUS BUT NOW CONTENT

<P>
To put a trickle of smile on the face of Kevin Crow and maybe sponge up some of 
his seriousness, Brian Quinn, Crow's Socker teammate and friend, has found a 
simple solution. Crack open a Guinness Stout for him. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe two. 
</P>
<P>
"It loosens him up," said Quinn, a midfielder from Belfast, Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
It was Quinn who introduced Crow, a native of Pleasanton, to the finer points 
of Irish beer drinking while on a team trip to Toronto. He took him out to the 
pub, and a few hours later, about six pints had gone by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
"For Americans," Quinn said, "that's unheard of. It's a lot for him. The Irish 
guys were just warming up." 
</P>
<P>
Crow, a defender in his sixth indoor season with the Sockers, has a reputation 
as a fairly serious, hard-working guy; ever concerned with improving and 
expanding his soccer skills; long on desire, short on chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always come across as a bit dure," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "He's 
very serious sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Crow, 27, doesn't giggle and smirk his way through practices. He won't be the 
guy waving the towel to the rocking beat of "Danger Zone" to rile the crowd 
late in the fourth quarter of a close game. Never once has he jumped up on the 
glass to celebrate a goal, a common practice in the Major Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
The wildest thing he might have ever done dates back to his days at San Diego 
State when, according to his former coach, George Logan, he attended a party 
dressed as a cheerleader. Complete with pompons. Uncharacteristic, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
"It shocked me," Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
But Crow's success in soccer has never really shocked anyone, least of all his 
former coaches. Logan knew right away he had found a gem. Newman calls him a 
diamond in the rough. 
</P>
<P>
Crow used to stay late after practice at SDSU and do drills by himself. He was 
always looking for extra work. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior during the 1982-83 season, Chuck Clegg's first as the Aztec coach, 
Crow was the team's captain and a quiet leader. Very quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say much," Clegg said, "but he was always to the point. He had a 
burning desire to succeed. Kevin's success is directly attributed to Kevin and 
no one else." 
</P>
<P>
Not to say there haven't a few snags in and around the success. With the 
Sockers, there have been plenty of ups and downs. Six indoor championships and 
a good deal of unrest tucked in between. 
</P>
<P>
Crow became a starter right away on the outdoor team after being drafted in the 
second round in February 1983. It took longer for him to crack into the 
starting lineup on the indoor team, but Crow -- despite competing against 
veterans who had helped the team to two championships -- eventually was given 
his chance midway through the first season. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the next three seasons, however, Crow became increasingly 
disenchanted with Socker management. His relationship with Newman was sometimes 
about as smooth as that of the Capulets and the Montagues. 
</P>
<P>
Crow didn't agree with some of Newman's coaching philosophies. Little things, 
such as his desire to pass the ball back to the goalie for defensive purposes 
when Newman prefered to push it forward. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, Crow vented his frustrations publicly. 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1987 he said: "The bottom line is I don't want to play for Ron 
Newman anymore. We don't see eye to eye. I'm not happy playing soccer here in 
San Diego. It's best that I go. I want to leave now." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer with the Sockers had become a chore, not fun. Crow said he felt certain 
players were allowed to do what they wanted to do. The environment wasn't 
right, and it didn't appear to be getting any better. 
</P>
<P>
Crow said the management at the time wasn't receptive to input from the 
players. The doors were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Crow said, players were told not to worry about statistics as long as 
they were contributing to the team's success. But come contract time, Crow 
said, they would go to negotiate and be told "you don't have the stats." 
</P>
<P>
So problems arose, and the only way to get points across seemed to be through 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
"When communication gets shut off -- whether it's between you and your wife or 
you and your best friend -- that's when problems develop," Crow said. "(The 
former management) didn't understand that (the media) was our only outlet. It's 
not the right way. It's not the best way. But it was the only way." So it went. 
But shortly after current management took over late in 1987 and began to settle 
in, Crow said, things improved. The doors of communication were opened. 
Consequently, Crow decided to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now there's no need to go to (the media) to complain," Crow said. 
"You're not going to see a lot of bickering in the press." 
</P>
<P>
Crow appears at peace now with his career and life. He and his wife, Brenda, 
have an 8-month-old daughter, Kendalle, who keeps them up at night sometimes. 
But he says it's a lot better staying up with your child than staying up to 
watch the late show. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no complaints," Crow said. "The family is going great. Soccer is going 
great." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer may have never been better. Crow is still the fine defensive player he 
was last season, when he led the team in blocked shots for the fourth season in 
a row and was chosen MISL defensive player of the year for the second time. But 
he has added a new dimension. Scoring. 
</P>
<P>
He now can be found slipping up from his defender position more often and 
sending a scorching shot at the opponent's goal. Crow is tied for third on the 
team, at 30 points, with veteran forward Steve Zungul. Crow has 17 goals and 13 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
A few other achievements: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In February against Tacoma, he became only the third player in indoor 
soccer history to record 500 career blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has been a MISL All-Star five consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has 83 blocks this year, fourth best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is the only Socker to start all 36 games this year and is first on the 
all-time team list with 259 game appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the individual accomplishments, those who know Crow well will tell you 
that it doesn't really matter to him where he ranks on the statistics sheet or 
in the record book. In fact, they say, he has never cared much about being 
recognized for his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn would tell you Crow has done volunteer work for St. Vincent de Paul for 
six years. Crow doesn't mention it. 
</P>
<P>
Clegg would tell you Crow donates his spare time to coach at San Diego State 
even if the Sockers are doing two-a-day workouts at the time. Crow won't. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Geib, Crow's coach at Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, would tell 
you about the time fans came to see Crow break the school's scoring record in 
the last game of the season. Crow was awarded a penalty kick after an opposing 
player tripped him. He let another player take the shot. His teammate scored. 
Crow doesn't bring that up either. 
</P>
<P>
He has his own perspective on individual statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"You might score three goals," he said, "but you might be the cause of two on 
your end, which never gets on the stat sheet." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of what Crow does never gets on the stat sheet. He always finishes first 
on the team's beach runs. He is also first when the team practices sprints. He 
usually is one of the last to leave the practice carpet at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Newman recalls a game with Wichita earlier this season when most of the players 
were dragging, fatigued from a few too many days on the road. But Crow was up 
and down the field. Everywhere. In the thick of the action. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin was just unbelievable," Newman said. "He seemed to take on the world. It 
was just a one-man show." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Crow's extraordinary energy has been one of the sources of his past 
problems with Newman. Crow marches at a little different pace than most 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sometimes he got frustrated because he wanted more strict discipline," 
Newman said. "If I forced everybody to train like Kevin, I'd burn them right 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Crow comes from an athletic background. His father, Wayne, played professional 
football for the Buffalo Bills and the Oakland Raiders and his uncle, Lindon 
Crow, played for the New York Giants and Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin played some football in high school but found it didn't hold his interest 
like soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"The macho (attitude) sort of turned me off about a lot of sports when I was 
younger," Crow said. "(In soccer) everybody gets to be the quarterback. 
Everybody has to share in the hard work. The players make the decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Crow says his decisions on the field have improved during his professional 
career. His vision is better. He sees the whole field. He also sees into the 
future. Soccer, he knows, won't pay his bills forever. So he has made plans to 
go into his own business when he's finished playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted to play the sport because I couldn't afford to walk away from 
it," he said. "I feel that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Newman says Crow is more mature than when he first joined the team. That, says 
Quinn, is debatable, simply because Crow was never immature. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't matured one inch," said Quinn, smiling. "He never gave the 
impression that he was immature. He has always looked like he was 45 years 
old." 
</P>
<P>
Just never played like it.

PLAYOFF FORMAT MEETS GOALS DESPITE FLAWS

<P>
With Southern Section teams in position to win as many as eight state 
basketball championships this weekend, Dean Crowley has no qualms proclaiming 
his section's radically altered playoff structure a major success. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley is the section administrator in charge of basketball and one of the 
chief architects of the playoff structure that this season grouped schools by 
enrollment to conform with the system used in the state tournament. Crowley 
said that the change was made with one objective: to qualify as many Southern 
Section teams as possible for the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Proof of the system's success, he said, is in the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, 20 Southern Section teams -- 10 in each of the boys' and girls' 
divisions -- qualified for the state tournament. This season that number nearly 
doubled with 18 boys' teams and 19 girls' teams advancing to the Southern 
California regionals. 
</P>
<P>
No Southern Section team so much as reached a championship game last season. 
But this year, eight of the 10 state finals will involve a Southern Section 
team. Since the state tournament resumed in 1981 after a 43-year absence 
because of logistical problems, the Southern Section has accounted for five of 
a possible 22 boys' titles and four of 22 girls' titles. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora, Trabuco Hills, Santa Clara and Bel-Air Prep will represent the 
Southern Section in the boys' state finals this weekend. The girls' finalists 
are Morningside, Katella, Brea-Olinda and Mission College Prep. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the state is going to have a tournament, we feel we have an 
obligation to get as many of our teams in the tournament as possible," Crowley 
said. "So we're quite pleased with our format." 
</P>
<P>
Yet problems abound. An informal poll of Valley-area coaches whose teams 
advanced to the playoffs revealed that some object to the basic structure and 
almost all believe that there are significant drawbacks to the system. 
</P>
<P>
Among the complaints: 
</P>
<P>
The .500 record rule. 
</P>
<P>
The selection process mandates a .500 overall record for inclusion in the 
playoffs for teams that failed to finish in the top three places in their 
leagues. The rule encourages teams to schedule weak nonleague competition in 
order to pad their records. 
</P>
<P>
"That forces everybody to look for the easiest competition and I don't know if 
that's what this should be all about," Camarillo Coach John Harbour said. "The 
record shouldn't be the only criterion." 
</P>
<P>
The erosion of league identity. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, teams from the same league may play in different brackets 
based on their enrollment. In the Marmonte League, for example, five of seven 
teams advanced to three different brackets. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just go on enrollment only," Simi Valley's Dean Bradshaw said. "The 
league classification should be the same. If a team can't compete at that 
level, then they can move to a different league." 
</P>
<P>
Too many byes. 
</P>
<P>
Some tournament divisions lacked sufficient entrants to form an even bracket, 
forcing numerous first-round byes. In the first round of the 5-A Division, for 
example, 10 of the 22 teams did not play. Hart, the Foothill League's 
second-place entry, played top-seeded Pasadena in the second round after each 
had first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
"Your place in league doesn't matter," Hart's Greg Herrick complained. "We 
finished second and under the old format we would have gotten another 
second-place team and flipped for the home-court (advantage). We won three of 
our last four league games, and as I look back now, those games weren't 
important." 
</P>
<P>
General dilution of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Southern Section crowned five boys' and five girls' champions. 
This season there were nine division winners for boys and nine for girls. Also, 
the tournament pool increased from 177 teams last season to 215. 
</P>
<P>
The additional brackets and teams, the inclusion of teams that finished fourth, 
fifth and even sixth in their leagues, plus the emphasis on the state rather 
than the Southern Section title have cheapened the tournament, some coaches 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, for example, finished sixth in the Marmonte League at 4-8 but 
qualified based on its 13-11 overall record. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're 2-8 in your league but have a .500 overall record, you're almost 
assured of going to the playoffs," Crespi's Paul Muff said. "That demeans what 
the playoffs are supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley admits that the format has flaws. Amendments are planned but the system 
is in place for at least another season. A return to the old format (divisions 
based on strength of leagues rather than enrollment) cannot be approved until 
January. In the meantime, Crowley will suggest changes at the March 28 meeting 
of the section coaches' advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley agrees with coaches who knock the .500 rule and will recommend its 
suspension for next season. The top three teams in each league automatically 
will qualify for the playoffs and thereafter a team's finish in league 
standings will be ignored. Teams will be selected based on overall record and 
strength of schedule. Crowely has yet to work out the details but said that he 
will pattern the formula after the system used by the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to fill the brackets with quality teams and we don't want schools 
padding their schedules with patsies to get to .500," he said. "We had about 16 
or 18 teams this year that we had to reject because of the .500 rule." 
</P>
<P>
That change will satisfy one complaint but exacerbate another. Under that 
change, as many as 20 to 30 teams with losing records may qualify for the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Some say that dilutes a championship and to a degree it might," Crowley said. 
"But what about the team that gets hot at the end of the season? Maybe they get 
some injured kids back or kids who were ineligible. It gives them a chance to 
compete. Getting in the playoffs is a good thing. It helps programs." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley also proposes a change that will force teams to choose a playoff 
division before the start of the season. This season teams seeking to move to a 
stronger division were given until the first week of January to decide. 
</P>
<P>
"We received accusations that schools were making deals," Crowley said. "They 
said coaches were saying, 'If you stay down, you can win there and we'll move 
up and win there.' I don't know if that happened, but we had the accusations, 
so we want everybody in place before the season starts." 
</P>
<P>
Those steps may alleviate some problems but they fail to address a central 
issue, Crowley said. Despite efforts to gear the playoffs toward the state 
tournament, a Southern Section title ranks above a state championship in many 
coaches' minds. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi's Muff called the state tournament anticlimactic, and Bradshaw, who was 
an assistant coach when Simi Valley won last season's Southern Section 4-A 
title, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The state tournament has not caught on," Bradshaw said. "The ultimate is still 
a Southern Section championship. When we won last year, the state tournament 
was just icing on the cake. The state tournament is an emotional letdown."

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ARM, HAMMER OF DELAHOYA LEAD GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grant High senior right-hander Javier Delahoya missed two days of school last 
week because of the flu. But in an East Valley League baseball game against 
North Hollywood on Thursday, he made his opponents queasy. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya, an All-City Section selection as a junior, struck out 13 and threw a 
two-hitter in a 13-2 win at Grant. He also homered in his first two at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya (1-0) allowed a pair of singles in the fourth inning when North 
Hollywood scored twice to close within 10-2. "He was a little rusty," Grant 
Coach Tom Lucero said of Delahoya, who walked seven and hit three batters. "The 
long layoff hurt him a little." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya hit a two-run home run in the first and a solo shot in the second. 
Neil Simon was two for two with three runs batted in for Grant (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
In other East Valley League games: 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 1, Poly 0 -- Jose Gallegos scored the winning run for the Spartans (1-1, 
1-1) on a squeeze bunt by Bruce Gomez with one out in the sixth inning at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Poly (3-2, 1-1) outhit the Spartans, 6-3, but left 11 runners on base. The 
Parrots loaded the bases in the third, sixth and seventh innings but failed to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
WEST VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 8, Canoga Park 1 -- Junior right-hander Reed McMackin threw a 
five-hitter, striking out 10 and walking four, at Lanark Park. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Simili was three for four with three RBIs, including a two-run triple in 
the seventh, and Kevin Chong was two for four with a home run for Chatsworth 
(5-2). 
</P>
<P>
Taft 6, El Camino Real 1 -- Benji Belfield retired eight of nine batters in 
relief of starter Scott Tiano to pick up the save for Taft (5-2, 2-0) at El 
Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Belfield had two of Taft's eight hits. Brett Reisner keyed a four-run fourth 
inning with a bases-loaded, two-run double. Jason Shapiro singled to extend his 
hitting streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
NORTH VALLEY LEAGUE

NORTHRIDGE REKINDLES CCAA HOPES WITH 7-6 WIN

<P>
Having lost five of its past six California Collegiate Athletic Assn. games, 
the Cal State Northridge baseball team resorted to voodoo before practice 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to get the proverbial monkey off their collective back, the 
Matador players burned a stuffed toy monkey, then buried the ashes behind home 
plate at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Northridge hitters ignited for 15 hits and pitcher Robert 
Wheatcroft doused a ninth-inning rally by UC Riverside to preserve a 7-6 
victory in a CCAA game at the Riverside Sports Complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some weird things happen the last few games," said Northridge Coach 
Bill Kernen, whose team fell from fifth to 16th in the NCAA Division II 
rankings this week. "Some pretty strange things, not just bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's a psychological thing. Who knows what happens. But we came out 
today and had a lot breaks." 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Northridge improved to 12-6 overall, 4-6 in conference play. 
Riverside dropped to 8-15, 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Wheatcroft (6-1), a senior right-hander, scattered 11 hits and struck out three 
in pitching his fourth complete game. Craig Clayton was four for five and 
scored two runs for Northridge while Greg Shockey and Randy Thompson each had 
three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge led, 7-5, in the seventh inning when Scott Einhorn hit a solo home 
run for Riverside to pull the Highlanders within a run. 
</P>
<P>
Wheatcroft walked John Holmes then surrendered a single to Scott Einhorn to 
open the Riverside ninth. But Holmes was cut down at third on a sacrifice 
attempt by Jim Radler. 
</P>
<P>
Wheatcroft then walked Jeff Goodale to load the bases before Logan Ostrander 
popped out to third and Mike Eatinger lined out to left. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will play host to Riverside at 2:30 this afternoon and conclude the 
series with the Highlanders on Saturday night at 7:30 at Riverside. GARY KLEIN

WHY BAKERSFIELD?; 
</P>
<P>
TOROS FEEL GOOD ABOUT CAGE TOURNEY, BAD ABOUT THE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills was chosen to compete in the Division II Western 
Regional basketball tournament, which begins here tonight, but the big question 
is "why are we in Bakersfield in the first place?" 
</P>
<P>
As the Toros prepared for the 8 p.m. game against host Cal State Bakersfield, 
newspapers in Los Angeles, Riverside and Alaska were questioning both the site 
and seeding process for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press questioned why top-seeded UC Riverside was not awarded the 
host bid. It also questioned how Cal State Bakersfield (20-8), which finished 
in a tie for third place in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. behind UC 
Riverside (25-4) and Dominguez Hills (19-9), deserved to be seeded No. 2 in 
this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield is hosting the tournament in large part, however, because it has 
more revenue potential in its new 3,700-seat gymnasium. During questioning by 
the media last Sunday, members of the national Division II selection committee 
repeatedly used the term "fiscal responsibility" in defense of choosing this 
year's eight regional playoff sites. 
</P>
<P>
Al Mathews, a regional selection committee member, went a step further when he 
told The Times: "Quite frankly, money is the most important criterion we look 
at." 
</P>
<P>
That means Bakersfield, with its larger facility and better chance for a 
sellout, won out over Riverside, whose gym seats only 955. The Highlanders, who 
play Sonoma State (17-12) tonight at 6, are making their 11th regional 
appearance but have not been a host yet. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside Coach John Masi, the CCAA Coach of the Year, also posed questions 
about the seeding process, most notably how Bakersfield could be seeded ahead 
of the Toros? Further, the media in Alaska and Riverside questioned how 
Bakersfield got in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In Alaska they felt one of the four teams should have been Alaska-Anchorage 
(21-9). Anchorage, a perennial power, was left out of the 32-team national 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield Athletic Director Rudy Carvajal said the choice between seeding 
Bakersfield or close" but that the Roadrunners topped the Toros because they 
had one more victory and played a more difficult preseason schedule. 
</P>
<P>
On how he engineered the tournament to Bakersfield, Carvajal said: "We did our 
homework. . . . We did a careful analysis of what it took to host it." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai said: "The bottom line is the players have 
earned this chance through hard work and it shouldn't be a case of money buying 
some teams out of it and others in." 
</P>
<P>
Masi questioned the link between Bakersfield getting in the tournament and the 
potential for higher profits in its new facility. He said he feels the 
top-seeded team in each region should be the automatic host and will work 
toward that change in the selection process this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Why have polls during the season? Why have a seeding process?" Masi asked. "It 
diminishes all these games we play to get here. Why don't we just wait until 
the final week, go find a big gym and everybody just play?" 
</P>
<P>
Yanai says changes are in order before next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to take a good look at developing some solid criteria." 
</P>
<P>
Masi also says he sees a need to change the process, but as for this weekend's 
visit to Bakersfield, he said: "Our kids feel like they have been cheated." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills is just happy to be included in postseason play, yet 
could be the great equalizer in the site debate. The Toros, losers of three of 
their last four games, defeated each of the three other regional teams on the 
opponent's home court during the year. A 68-56 victory Feb. 2 over Bakersfield, 
however, was played in the city's old Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the way our team has practiced," said Yanai, who was forced 
to wait until last Sunday to discover if the Toros were in the playoffs. "It 
was a case of not letting the kids get down. It was very important to keep the 
guys focused." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills practiced even though it was unsure it had a postseason berth, 
yet it was a rematch with Bakersfield that was on their minds. A last second 
52-50 loss in Carson to the Roadrunners was still fresh in their minds because 
a Bakersfield player allegedly had words with Dominguez guard Michael Bell in a 
parking lot confrontation during the CCAA tournament March 3. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who said he was caught off-guard by the comments, summed up the team's 
feelings: "We're stopping in Bakersfield on our way to Springfield." 
</P>
<P>
The winners of tonight's games play Saturday night at 8 and the victor advances 
to the eight-team final the following week in Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
With dollars and cents playing such an important role at this event, tonight's 
losing teams need not fuss much. There's a meaningless third-place game slated 
for Saturday at 6 to pick up a couple of extra bucks for the tournament.

ROGER SIMON: BATTLING HIS CONSCIENCE ON GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Good Roger had come to Washington. He had assembled graphs and charts and 
expert testimony. He had come to testify before Congress on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Bad Roger had come with him. He was naked to the waist. His chest was 
crisscrossed by bandoleers of ammunition. His hair had been cut into a Mohawk 
stripe. He wore camouflage paint on his face. He carried an AK-47 in one hand 
and an Uzi in the other. 
</P>
<P>
Above his heart were tattooed the words: "Have a Nice Day." 
</P>
<P>
Good Roger is the decent, caring, wonderful side of me. Bad Roger is the 
twisted, evil, despicable side of me. 
</P>
<P>
"But in this column, I am to be known by my nom de guerre ," Bad Roger said. "I 
am to be called Rambo Roger." 
</P>
<P>
"And if I refuse?" Good Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"I will exercise my rights as a decent, law-abiding American," Rambo Roger 
said. "I will shoot you." 
</P>
<P>
Good Roger eyed the AK-47 and the Uzi nervously. "Do you have a license for 
those things?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't need one," Rambo Roger said. "I live just outside Washington in 
Maryland. If I wanted to buy a handgun, I would have to go and fill out an 
application and wait seven days so the state police could find out if I was a 
lunatic killer or an escaped convict. And, in fact, the state police reject 
hundreds of such handgun applications every year." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank goodness for that," Good Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"But to get an assault rifle," Rambo Roger said, "to get a high-powered, 
fast-firing attack rifle capable of shredding human flesh, no waiting period or 
background check is required." 
</P>
<P>
"That's crazy!" Good Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"No, that's America," Rambo Roger said. "A subtle distinction, I admit." 
</P>
<P>
Good Roger had come to Congress to urge it to pass a bill that would ban the 
purchase of semiautomatic weapons nationwide without a background check and 
waiting period. Rambo Roger was against it. 
</P>
<P>
"You are actually defending the practice of buying extremely dangerous weapons 
without a background check?" Good Roger asked aghast. 
</P>
<P>
"What I am defending," Rambo Roger said, "is the constitutional right to shoot 
your boss on your lunch hour." 
</P>
<P>
"That's in the Constitution?" Good Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Rambo Roger said. "It's called the pursuit of happiness." 
</P>
<P>
"For your information, 'the pursuit of happiness' appears not in the 
Constitution, but in the Declaration of Independence," Good Roger sniffed. Good 
Roger loves to sniff at stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
"You think you're so smart," Rambo Roger said. "OK, forget about pursuit of 
happiness. Being able to shoot your boss on your lunch hour comes under 
'domestic tranquility.' " 
</P>
<P>
"You really believe it is necessary to be able to get a semiautomatic weapon 
instantly?" Good Roger asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Rambo Roger said. "Let's say your boss comes up to you and says, 
'Well, Throckmorton, late again today, I see. One more time and this will go on 
your permanent record.' " 
</P>
<P>
"So?" 
</P>
<P>
"So under current law, you can get up from your desk, go down to your local gun 
shop, buy an Uzi, come back and even up the score with your boss and anybody 
else who gets in your way all in under 10 minutes," Rambo Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"And that is necessary in a decent society?" 
</P>
<P>
"Who said anything about a decent society? I am talking about America in the 
'80s," Rambo Roger replied. 
</P>
<P>
"And you would not accept even a seven-day waiting period?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course not!" Rambo Roger said. "If you have to wait seven days, you might 
calm down. You might have a session with your psychiatrist. Your boss might 
come over and apologize. Or give you a raise. And then where would you be?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sane and happy?" 
</P>
<P>
"But you wouldn't have gotten even!" Rambo Roger said. "Don't you realize who 
my fellow gun nuts are? They are people consumed by hatreds and jealousies and 
petty angers that have accumulated over a lifetime. Their guns are their only 
release, their only way to even up the score with a world they believe has 
mistreated them." 
</P>
<P>
"How come you get to say whole, long paragraphs and all I ever get is one or 
two sentences at a time?" Good Roger asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the writer," Rambo Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"But how are you going to persuade legislators to vote your way?" Good Roger 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Give them money," Rambo Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's bribery!" 
</P>
<P>
"No, that's democracy," Rambo Roger said. "You stick a hundred dollars in a 
senator's shirt pocket, that's bribery. But you give him a hundred dollar 
'honorarium' and that's OK. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"You will fail in your attempts," Good Roger said. "Any person in his right 
mind will support at least a background check and a waiting period for assault 
rifles." 
</P>
<P>
"Any person in his right mind?" Rambo Roger crowed. "Well, that lets out the 
Congress!"

NICOTINE GUM IS ONLY FOR QUITTERS; 
</P>
<P>
THE NO-SMOKING AID WON'T HELP YOU JUST CUT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I'm a long-time smoker, I enjoy smoking and I don't have any plans to 
stop. But I would like to cut down on the amount I smoke, which is now more 
than two packs a day. I went to my doctor and asked him for a prescription for 
nicotine chewing gum, but he said he would not give it to me as long as I 
continued to smoke. Wouldn't it be a good idea to use the nicotine gum to cut 
down on the amount a person smokes? Is there any special way the gum should be 
used? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: While smoking less is better than smoking more, not smoking at all is 
best of all. And it is generally agreed that smokers have the best chance of 
kicking the habit when they begin using nicotine chewing gum only after they've 
stopped smoking completely. It is better not to use the gum simply to cut down 
on the number of cigarettes smoked. 
</P>
<P>
As for how the gum is to be used, the nicotine from the gum is absorbed in the 
mouth; therefore, it should be chewed slowly. In addition, it should be used 
for at least three months because of the risk of relapse during that time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My sister-in-law suddenly developed a kind of facial paralysis that the 
doctor diagnosed as Bell's palsy. Since then I've spoken with a lot of people 
who either had this condition or who knew people who had it. From what they 
tell me, sometimes the condition clears up by itself, but this doesn't happen 
all the time. Is there any way anyone can predict whether the condition will 
get any better? 
</P>
<P>
A: The results of a study conducted in Scotland suggest that a poor outcome in 
patients with Bell's palsy is associated with the patient's age, the severity 
of the condition initially and the length of time that elapsed before 
spontaneous improvement occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A lot of times when people want to make fun of a condition they say that 
it's as serious as an ingrown toenail. But as someone who often gets ingrown 
toenails, I'm not laughing. They hurt too much. Is it possible that there is 
something wrong with the shape of my nails that make them ingrown? 
</P>
<P>
A: An English study of patients with ingrowing toenails who were scheduled for 
surgery showed no differences between their nails and those of a group of 
control subjects. In other words, an abnormal nail shape does not appear to be 
responsible for the ingrowth. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to know what is meant when a cheese is said to be natural. 
Could you give some examples? 
</P>
<P>
A: A natural cheese is one made directly from milk. Swiss, Cheddar and cottage 
cheese are some examples of natural cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I went with my mother to her doctor for a checkup, and he emphasized how 
important it is for older people to drink water. He made it sound as if it is a 
serious problem, and I would like to know if you agree that it is something to 
be emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
A: Older people often consume less water than they should, partly because the 
body's thirst responses become impaired as a person grows older. The situation 
may be complicated in those with urinary problems, who may deliberately limit 
their intake of fluids and therefore risk dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My mother is 84 years old, and she sometimes complains of being dizzy. Can 
you tell me the causes? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are a number of possibilities that might explain dizziness in a person 
your mother's age. Even something as simple as the excessive use of aspirin may 
cause some imbalance. But speculation would not be helpful; I suggest an early 
appointment with her physician to determine the cause and recommend appropriate 
treatment.

Wondering what to wear Oscar night? Well, wander past the "Hold" rack at Fred 
Hayman Beverly Hills for some hints. That's where four of Hollywood's finest 
have set aside their tentative selections, Listen hears from Hayman's 
spokeswoman Kay Sweet. With the big night less than two weeks away, award 
presenters Anjelica Huston, Anne Archer, Jacqueline Bisset and Olivia 
Newton-John are still thinking it over. But Sweet, who's helping to coordinate 
the show, says she's been advised that the burning issue of what to wear is 
always decided at the last minute. "And even people who say, 'I'm going to wear 
this,' may show up in something else," Sweet says. Meanwhile, this is a 
definite: The sanctified Oscar fragrance will be Hayman's new 273. On the night 
of the awards presentation, Hayman will present each female nominee and 
presenter with a bottle of his new fragrance.

Having Designs on Towels 
</P>
<P>
The folks at Hermes, the venerable and conservative French leather and fashion 
house, were in for a bit of a shocker recently when a "proper, three-piece-suit 
type of Japanese businessman" purchased 12 large beach towels at $450 each at 
the Rodeo Drive boutique. Manager Francine Bardot said the man told her he 
owned the towels in every pattern and design. When she politely inquired why, 
he explained that he was a dentist and used the towels instead of paper bibs to 
cover his patients. The cheery-looking towels -- which come in fish, bird and 
balloon designs, to name a few -- made his patients feel warm and less nervous, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He's Maxed Out 
</P>
<P>
About those rumors: No, Leon Max is not going out of business, and yes, he is 
hooking up with a Tokyo manufacturer for a line of women's clothes, sold only 
in Japan. The rest of the story is less encouraging. L.A.'s high-profile 
fashion designer says he's cutting his newest and priciest Leon Max label from 
the women's-wear line. And, he already abandoned his menswear collection. "It 
never quite got out of the gate," he says. "It was a drain on the business." 
Add his name to a list of local menswear designers biting the belt. Glenn 
Williams says he's slashed his collections from 5 to 2 per year. And Christian 
de Castelnau halted production of his fall collection but expects to be back 
for the holidays.

A Heartfelt Party 
</P>
<P>
Phil Collins had himself fitted for a Perry Ellis tuxedo this week, on his way 
to a party honoring him, Lamont Dozier and their Grammy-winning song "Two 
Hearts." Sen. Edward Kennedy's sister Jean Kennedy Smith was at the party too. 
She wants to use the tune to promote the International Very Special Arts 
Festival for handicapped children in Washington in June. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Under Pressure 
</P>
<P>
It appears that former Vogue editor Grace Mirabella will go to just about any 
lengths to make her new namesake fashion magazine, Mirabella, become a hit. 
Grace and several members of her staff showed up at a cocktail party for 
Geoffrey Beene, wearing T-shirts that sported her photo and were printed with: 
"Magazine, thy name is Mirabella." Actually, it was nice to see the usually 
painfully chic fashion pack having a little fun with their wardrobes. The first 
issue of Mirabella debuts in June. 
</P>
<P>
Talking Back 
</P>
<P>
"Mad as hell and not going to take it anymore" may be a new motto for the 
fashion industry. Two magazine articles in April address critics of some of our 
most important designers. Elle magazine is running a piece by writer Sarah 
Ferguson called "Style Wars," in response to last December's controversial 
Newsweek cover story that asked, "Who Would Wear This Stuff?" Details magazine 
is debuting a new commentary column with a piece by designer Ronaldus Shamask. 
It's a rebuttal to a review of his spring collection that appeared in the New 
York Times, stating some of his styles were "obviously inspired by the recent 
showings in Paris" and that "echoes of Claude Montana were particularly 
strong." Shamask points out that his samples were designed and finished by the 
time the Paris shows got under way.

BOOKS FOR LOOKS: STYLISH GUIDE TO COLLECTING AN ART FORM

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bakelite Jewelry Book, by Corinne A. Davidov and Ginny Redington Dawes 
(Abbeville Press: $35). 
</P>
<P>
This is a celebration of the cheeky plastic costume jewelry manufactured 
primarily from 1933 to 1941. Like the jewelry itself, the book is direct, 
colorful and stylish -- occasionally elegant and occasionally silly. 
</P>
<P>
The authors, both of whom are serious Bakelite collectors, have managed to 
convey their delight and appreciation for this funky art form in both their 
words and photo choices. 
</P>
<P>
They have assembled an impressive history of Bakelite jewelry as well as 
numerous examples of both common and rare pieces. They have also included a 
useful price guide for beginning collectors.

Heads-Up Advice on Care of the Skin 
</P>
<P>
Smart Face: A Dermatologist's Guide to Saving Your Money and Saving Your Skin, 
by Thomas Goodman MD and Stephanie Young (Prentice Hall Press: $9.95). 
</P>
<P>
For those perlexed by all the emerging terms and claims describing today's 
"advanced" skin-care products and treatment routines, this book provides 
considerable help in making informed consumer choices. 
</P>
<P>
It's particularly useful in that it provides extensive information in areas 
usually treated only superficially in the mass media. An entire chapter is 
devoted to the subject of sun damage and sun protection, for instance. And the 
chapter on moisturizing not only gives the standard information on what 
moisturizers can and cannot accomplish, it also describes the functions of the 
new, so-called "super moisturizers," which contain such ingredients as 
hyaluronic acid. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the authors (a Memphis dermatologist and a free-lance writer based 
in New York City) have included a lengthy, though incomplete, list of popular 
cosmetic products, with comments on their ingredients, price, skin-type 
suitability and unique properties. BETTY JEAN BARNHILL

SECOND CITY STORMS WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ring out the old, ring in the new. Chicago's Second City has blown into town 
and taken over the Mayfair in Santa Monica -- and the joint is jumping. 
</P>
<P>
It will break some hearts to see the former Victorian red and gold of the old 
Mayfair Music Hall lobby conformed into yet another of those sleek, neutered, 
high-tech spaces with the exposed ducts and pipes that seem to be the requisite 
for hip. It's all cabaret seating inside. Gone is the grand old semicircular 
rococo lobby bar, replaced by . . . just a bar. 
</P>
<P>
But gone, too, is the erratic programming. If the content on stage was 
unpredictable at the Mayfair and New Mayfair (as it was called when it was less 
new), the streamlining outside heralds the streamlining inside. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old improv comedy troupe from the Windy City has opened a local 
franchise. It's been a steady hatchery for top comedy talent, spawning such 
names as Mike Nichols, Elaine May, the Belushi brothers and John Candy among 
dozens -- literally -- of familiar alums. Nor did Second City wait for the 
reviews to be in to sign a 10-year lease. The company is here to stay and we're 
the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
"For a Good Time Call . . . 451-0621" is a shrewd, smart, savvy series of quick 
takes dealing with everything from malpractice insurance and hyperkinetic 
Space-Age kids to revisionist school teachers, secret male fantasies and a 
slow-motion Western spoof. You name it, they've got it. And if they don't have 
it, don't worry. They'll create it. On the spot. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing new about improv and scripted comedy of this type, but these 
young comedians have pedigrees. They're direct descendants of the inventors of 
the genre. Like the work of the San Francisco Committee, the old Credibility 
Gap or the current Los Angeles Groundlings (and an endless effluvium of young 
imitators), comedy as a series of fast blackouts is very much in vogue. Not all 
who are called, though, are necessarily choice. What Second City delivers in 
Santa Monica is prime stuff. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the difference? Outrage, a keen sensibility and sharp eye for what's 
funny. Director Jeff Michalski didn't invent the sketches without the terrific 
ensemble of seven who perform them -- Dana Anderson, Chris Barnes, Robin Duke, 
John Hemphill, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake and Jane Morris -- but he can be credited 
for the selection of scenes that comprise the show and for its superswift pace, 
sandwiching snappy living cartoons between blackouts and longer segments. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe picks up on political satire, one of the most lamented lapses in 
comedy today. There's a solo Washington, D.C., rap song and a group song about 
the deficit ("We're gonna stick it to the children / Dump it on the kids / 
Leave it to our heirs / To clean up our affairs / Chips off the H &amp; R Block 
. . . "), but better still, they deliver a sizzling indictment of homelessness 
in the form of a fantasy revue, performed against a giant American flag as 
backdrop. The point is not lost. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest clue to the group's sense of social responsibility is the top of 
the second half. It takes nerve, in the middle of an evening of comedy, to do a 
series of short sketches, commentaries almost, related to the tragedy of AIDS. 
These are beautifully done, one scene overlapping into another, with a 
deepening solemnity. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there were bimbos in Wednesday's audience who laughed all the way through, 
as though programmed in their expectations and having no minds of their own, 
they had to continue to laugh. And no, it was not nervous laughter. 
</P>
<P>
What the members of Second City do requires class as well as skill. This was 
brilliantly illustrated in a glowing sketch with three people at a bar telling 
stories, demonstrating the subtle difference a good (or bad) storyteller can 
make to similar sets of events. 
</P>
<P>
The members of Second City can tell stories and then some. 
</P>
<P>
About that 10-year lease -- is there an option to extend? 
</P>
<P>
 At 214 Santa Monica Blvd. in Santa Monica, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:30 p.m.; 
Fridays and Saturdays, 8 and 10:30 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Indefinitely. 
Tickets: $12.95-$13.95. (213) 451-0621). P.S. Deli food and drink can be 
ordered before the show and during the intermission.

A CULTURAL REVOLUTIONARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He played Pu Yi's jailer in last year's Oscar-winning movie "The Last Emperor," 
the jailer who saved the life of the emperor after he had slashed his wrists. 
And when at the movie's end he was seen wearing a dunce cap, being led down the 
street and humiliated by the hated Red Guards, it was not so far removed from 
his own life. 
</P>
<P>
He brought Arthur Miller and "Death of a Salesman" to China, translated the 
play into Chinese, and did the lead role of Willy Loman. His other important 
role, from his own perspective, was as Mongolian emperor Kublai Khan in the NBC 
miniseries "Marco Polo." 
</P>
<P>
He cut the ribbon several months ago at the Beijing Art Gallery with its 
startling (for China) exhibition of nude art. "I feel rather strongly -- not as 
the vice minister of culture but, as a man, as an artist, that the art of the 
nude should be introduced to China, that we should get rid of these 
puritanical, medieval ideas about the body. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But he stayed away from a later avant-garde exhibit because, Ying Ruocheng 
explained, "I think it's going a bit too far, (with artists) snapping condoms 
all over the place. We didn't ban it. We had to stop it twice. . . ." Once it 
was stopped when an artist shot her own painting, another when there was a bomb 
threat by those who wanted the exhibit closed, but it reopened anyway, Ying 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ying is one of four vice ministers of culture in China, whose responsibility 
involves art galleries (but not museums) and the performing arts -- everything 
from theater and opera to acrobatic troupes and puppet shows. He has come to 
the United States, first to Los Angeles and on to New York next week, to sign 
</P>
<P>
the Joffrey Ballet as the opening act of the second China Arts Festival in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
This year's festival, with the Bolshoi Ballet and other companies from 10 
nations, marks the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic, which, on the 
cultural front, at least, appears to have come a long way from the time when 
the nation was disparagingly tagged Red China. 
</P>
<P>
"We were madly interested in ballet because it's something new and very popular 
in China," said Ying at the Sheraton Grande Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. "We 
had our ballet born in the 1950s, but it was on the Russian model. We were cut 
off from the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
With his fluent and often colloquial English, his navy blazer, charcoal slacks 
and conservative-striped tie, Ying might have passed for an American 
businessman or a professor of theater, which he had been in 1982 at the 
University of Missouri. While he spoke, a representative of the Chinese 
consulate taped the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"The only ballet we knew," Ying said, "was either Russian or revolutionary -- 
in the sense of the 'Red Detachment of Women,' that kind of thing. . . . 
Technically they were very good but there certainly was no individuality, no 
personal touch, and the theme was very limited. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in the last 10 years," Ying said, noting the departure from the days of 
China's autocratic Cultural Revolution, "have we come in touch with another 
world of ballet, modern ballet, ballet that does not have its roots in a 
19th-Century point of view, and it's very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
The Bolshoi Ballet will perform at the arts festival, marking the first time 
the Soviet Union has sent a performing-arts group to China in "God knows how 
many years" and "playing, of course, still 'Swan Lake.' It's all very good, of 
course, the best in the world, but we felt that perhaps America could provide a 
breath of fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
For the Joffrey's artistic director, Gerald Arpino, the Ministry of Culture's 
invitation is "a double honor. We are representing the United States, and we 
are opening the festival." The company will perform its ballet "Trinity." 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiching hour-apiece press interviews into a tight schedule, the robust 
59-year-old vice minister -- who makes no bones about the fact that acting is 
more "fun," despite the Volkswagen and official banquets that come with the 
government job -- provided a window on the arts in China. 
</P>
<P>
He also talked about freedom and censorship, which he knows all too well, 
having spent several years with his late wife, actress Wu Shiliang, in a 
"re-education" camp during the Cultural Revolution. "But that was much better 
than the 'struggle meetings'," he said. "You're singled out at a mass meetings, 
and everybody would start swearing at you, and sometimes we were told to bow 
down . . . Red Guards pulling your arm saying, 'Kneel,' and then I say I have 
nothing to confess and they say, 'Confess.' " 
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the explosion of television viewing over the last decade in his 
country of 1.1 billion people where there are now 600 million viewers -- "in 
the cities now 90% are in possession of a TV set; in the countryside at least 
50%" -- Ying seemed pleased and disappointed at once. Until television, he 
said, probably 80% never had a chance to see any kind of cultural performance. 
</P>
<P>
Still, going to the theater has dropped off, Ying lamented, among those who 
were able to go. China has transportation problems, and by the time theater 
ends "you've missed your bus. It's much more comfortable to sit at home with a 
glass of beer in front of TV." 
</P>
<P>
He calls TV watching a "fever." 
</P>
<P>
Ying, who has been vice minister for nearly three years, scoffs at the notion 
that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev invented glasnost, or openness, or 
perestroika, or restructuring, in communist countries. "Gorbachev is such a 
good publicist," he said. "We started this long before he did, more than 10 
years ago. (Senior leader) Deng Xiaoping had this idea first. . . . The 
Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, but it took us a couple of years to sort of 
recover." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ying said, there is so much to do: "We are restructuring our performing 
arts groups as a whole. The basic aim is to give them much more autonomy, 
freedom in the choice of what they put on. Autonomy in the handling of their 
money, in the hiring and firing of their members, but this is a job that has to 
be done very carefully, very circumspectly. We've made some headway, important 
headway. 
</P>
<P>
"This is linked to the whole social structure of China, the idea of what we 
call the 'iron rice bowl' which means in practice that when you join a group 
you're there for life. Your pay is very low" -- on average, he said, about $60 
a month -- "but you get get so many benefits that you don't want to leave. You 
pay the equivalent of $3 a month for your apartment, you have your medical care 
free, retirement is guaranteed, so if you fire someone you have to put them 
somewhere where they can enjoy the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's not easy because the whole society is being restructured and 
factories are doing the same," he said. One way it's being handled is through 
earlier retirement. Another way is to allow performing-arts groups "to run 
their own little enterprises" -- a canteen, a bookshop, a wig production shop 
-- "and we could take care of quite a number of people that way." 
</P>
<P>
Ying maintained that "each individual company is free to choose whatever it 
wants to do, as far as content is concerned. As for artistic quality that's in 
the hands of the critics. The government should be the government. It should 
not interfere in either the content or form of art." 
</P>
<P>
But when asked where the arts in China are not achieving full cultural freedom, 
Ying said: "I don't think one would ever reach that goal. There are so many 
restrictions on freedom. It's not only the government. The government may 
remove all the restrictions but there still are lifetime habits, conservative 
views, and sometimes maybe the fault is even with the artist that his stuff 
isn't good enough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"With our traditional forms of art, there is also audience resistance. Someone 
who loves the Peking Opera for instance, when he sees any changes is angry. He 
thinks it should be preserved, museum pieces. A lot of Japanese Kabuki is that 
way, but I met a great Kabuki actor (who) has the courage to strike new paths." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about recent reports of film censorship in China, Ying, while suggesting 
the reports are "exaggerated," said that the "film bureau is of course rather 
careful about films, much more so than on stage. Because stage performances as 
a rule reach limited numbers of people, and because film simultaneously could 
become a very powerful thing. I think some form of censorship will always exist 
whether it's government or social." 
</P>
<P>
A line from the end of a popular 1987 movie "A Small Town Called Hibiscus" in 
which a madman prophesied that there will be a Cultural Revolution every seven 
years or so, was cut, although the madman scene was retained. "This was meant 
as a sarcastic remark quoting Mao. Out of respect for Mao," Ying said, the cut 
was made. "There are still people who feel that in order not to upset the apple 
cart, it's important that Mao's image be kept as little tarnished as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The apple cart," explained Ying, "is what we call stability." 
</P>
<P>
Still Ying, as an actor and now for nearly three years as a vice minister, is 
doing his part to let the outside world in. He brought in "Death of a Salesman" 
in 1983 because of its theme of "the generation gap and the shattering of a 
dream. And that's what a lot of people were going through. The younger 
generation was beginning to defy the values of the older one, and the older one 
faced with the total fiasco of the Cultural Revolution was trying to cling to 
the old idea and force it on to the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
"Amadeus," which Ying directed in China, was brought in in 1986 because the 
play "deals with mediocrity against talent, and it is a theme which is red-hot 
in China. . . . That kind of mediocrity encouraged mediocrity, and mediocrity 
once in power will go on to suppress talent. And that's a situation which 
occurs very widely in China." He laughed. "Most people will feel they are 
Mozarts of course. We have Salieris in our midst." 
</P>
<P>
And he recently helped arrange for Charlton Heston to direct "The Caine Mutiny 
Court Martial," which Ying translated. "It's still running to packed houses. 
China is trying very, very hard to legalize our system -- China does not have a 
tradition of legality -- so people are fascinated by the courtroom scenes of 
what a prosecutor could and could not do. . . . And the character of Queeg. He 
rings a bell anywhere in the world, I think. We have enough Queegs."

R.E.M. TAKES ON CHALLENGE OF THE BIG ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
R.E.M. walked on stage Wednesday at the Forum to clamorous applause, but also 
amid major questions. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't tell from the cheers of the near-capacity crowd that there was any 
problem surrounding the Georgia-based rock quartet, but the group has been 
under attack by some longtime fans for allegedly turning its back on the 
principles that made it the most acclaimed college/alternative band of the 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
The supposed sins: The band jumped last year from I.R.S. Records, an 
independent label that has championed underground acts, to big-time Warner 
Bros. Records. And the band is now headlining basketball arenas rather than 
more intimate halls. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of the disenchantment, observers point to the limp No. 35 finish 
for its first Warner Bros. release, "Green," in this year's Village Voice poll 
of U.S. pop critics -- a poll where its five previous albums made the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt aware of the controversy, R.E.M. employed some good-natured visuals at 
the start of Wednesday's concert to show that its heart is still in the right 
place by mocking many of the cliches of patronizing arena-rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
While singer Michael Stipe stood back near the drum kit on the darkened stage, 
words flashed on a movie screen above him: 
</P>
<P>
 WELCOME (your city here). 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in rapid succession: 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN (your city here). 
</P>
<P>
 ARE YOU READY (crowd noise here). 
</P>
<P>
 I SAID, "ARE YOU READY?" 
</P>
<P>
 The band also used its theatrical instincts as it tackled the issue of its 
integrity and credibility by opening the concert with "Pop Song '89," a cut 
from the "Green" album that, among other things, serves as a mini-debate about 
the role of pop music. 
</P>
<P>
As the words weather and government flashed on the screen, Stipe raised the old 
question about whether pop should just entertain (the goal of arena acts) or 
demonstrate a social or artful point of view (a trademark of much alternative 
music). Asked Stipe in the song: "Should we talk about the weather . . . / 
Should we talk about the government?" 
</P>
<P>
R.E.M. gave its own answer with a series of blistering songs that attack 
conformity and misplaced values, including "Exhuming McCarthy" and "Welcome to 
the Occupation." To drive home his anger at the complacency of America's 
citizenry, Stipe acted out the songs with a series of movements -- marching 
steps, raised-arm salutes -- associated with a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
As the band (augmented on this tour by keyboardist-guitarist Peter Holsapple) 
played with enough fury to touch those even in the farthest rows of the 
18,000-seat arena, Stipe continued to perform with the arty mannerisms of a 
manic David Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
In these moments, R.E.M.'s energy and imagination made the objections to the 
move to arenas seem little more than petty cult elitism. 
</P>
<P>
Still the concert didn't resolve a more troubling and legitimate problem facing 
the group at this point in its career: The reason "Green" finished far down in 
the Voice poll is that the album's songs are so marginal. 
</P>
<P>
The magic of R.E.M.'s early albums was the way Stipe's slurred, off-center 
vocal style and the music's dreamy textures alluded to emotions rather than 
spelled them out. The songs, built around themes of youthful wonder and the 
search for values, invited you to fill in the blanks with your own experience. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, R.E.M. was in a place of leadership in American rock and it quite 
rightly felt it was time to move out of the shadows and more clearly articulate 
its positions. The group made the move on the "Document" album with such energy 
and craft that songs from the LP -- including "Finest Worksong" and "It's the 
End of the World . . ." -- represented the artistic heart of Wednesday's 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Green" album, R.E.M. articulated its themes with even more clarity than 
on "Document," but the group had little to say. There is a positive and 
encouraging tone to "Get Up" and "Stand," but other bands -- Hothouse Flowers 
and the Waterboys, among others -- offer the same thoughts these days far more 
gracefully and movingly. 
</P>
<P>
Those songs and the fizzy "Orange Crush" also seemed soulless on stage -- 
leaving R.E.M. strangely impotent. The exception from the new album was "You 
Are the Everything," as tender and affecting a love song as Stipe has written. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very scared for this world / I'm very scared for me," he sang with a 
tenderness that recalled the warmth and personal vision of some of the band's 
most endearing early numbers. 
</P>
<P>
In that moment, it was clear that the issue that will determine R.E.M.'s place 
in rock during the '90s won't revolve around the size of the halls, but whether 
it is able to bounce back from "Green" and write songs with the heartfelt 
vision of its best days. It is a formidable challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed Robyn Hitchcock turned in a short but spirited set highlighted by 
"Veins of the Queen," a new tune about trying to understand the human qualities 
of revered or unapproachable figures. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite of the alternative / college crowd, Hitchcock is a talented 
writer whose flavorful melodies could appeal to a wider audience. But his 
imaginative themes are usually so oblique that it's hard to picture him tapping 
into the mainstream. So he'll probably be spared the debate over whether he 
should or shouldn't headline arenas.

More on Letterman: His uninvited guest -- a woman charged with breaking into 
his home on several occasions -- has been ordered to undergo further 
psychiatric exams to determine whether she understands the charges against her. 
The attorney for Margaret Ray, 36, requested the additional tests after one 
psychiatrist found her competent to stand trial. Ray faces charges of criminal 
trespassing, burglary, possession of marijuana and larceny. She was arrested 
for breaking into Letterman's home in New Canaan, Conn., on Feb. 28. It was the 
second time in five days that she had been found inside Letterman's unoccupied 
house, and last spring, she also had been arrested twice for breaking into his 
home that's about 40 miles north of New York City. Ray will return to court 
March 28 to learn whether the judge believes she is competent to stand trial.

Rock's quintessential New York voice Lou Reed, in his 20th album, titled "New 
York," proclaims that the city is in terminal decline, a dirty island sinking 
into a filthy river watched over by a "Statue of Bigotry" that taunts the poor 
huddled masses she lured into hopeless poverty and brutality. "I'll take 
Manhattan," Reed sings, "in a garbage bag." But Reed, 47, told Reuters in an 
interview that the album's bitter rage and venomous humor did not reflect 
despair, just reality. "I think it's a pretty accurate, kind of jaundiced view 
-- with a lot of humor -- of some of the things that are going on in this city 
that I really care about," said Reed, who 20 years ago helped found the Velvet 
Underground, the Andy Warhol-sponsored band that shattered rock lyrics taboos.

Pop singer Jonathon (Chico) DeBarge has been sentenced to five years and eight 
months in federal prison for conspiring to take 2.2 pounds of cocaine into 
Michigan from California. Hoping to convince U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen 
(in Michigan) of his good character, DeBarge, 22, sent Enslen press clippings, 
including one about his anti-drug campaign at a junior high school less than a 
month before his arrest. But the judge countered, "Who have you harmed by your 
hypocrisy?" ALEENE MacMINN

INTENSE 'PAPERHOUSE' HAUNTED BY NIGHTMARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fever dreams, daydreams, nightmares, the world of art and imagination: These 
are the subjects of Bernard Rose's "Paperhouse" (AMC Century 14). But the film 
isn't shot in that languorous, soft-focus style we associate with movies about 
reverie. The vision here is laceratingly sharp. Ultimately, "Paperhouse" 
becomes a film about how dreams can subvert or attack the real world, open it 
up to fear, loathing and maybe rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
In "Paperhouse's" dream world, the light is pitiless, pouring down on a 
doppelganger land of eerily isolated fields and trashed houses, full of harsh 
surfaces, hidden monsters and keen, knife-like edges -- a world ready to crack 
open over a hellish, fiery core. Much of the movie is set in the mind of a 
sick, bedridden little girl, creating her own territory on paper, with paints 
or crayons, and in the inner chambers of her mind -- in dreams and delirium. 
And it becomes grindingly intense, a visually and aurally sophisticated little 
shocker, shivery and ripe with childhood terrors. 
</P>
<P>
"Paperhouse" is based on a Catherine Storr novel called "Marianne Dreams." 
Here, the re-named Anna (Charlotte Burke) is a little girl who makes childish 
pictures and then dreams herself into a world where they become real. The 
tilted house of her drawings stands huge and abandoned in a vast, deserted 
field of endlessly waving gray-green grass, its rooms occupied by another of 
her creations: a little, legless, stick-figure boy called Marc (Elliott 
Spiers). 
</P>
<P>
Is he also real? Anna's doctor has another patient, another Marc: suffering 
from muscular dystrophy. And, gradually, Anna becomes convinced that the fates 
of the dream Marc, the drawn Marc and the real Marc are inextricably joined, 
and that her drawings are changing all their lives, perhaps destroying them. 
Every personal and psychic horror she can imagine, including the conversion of 
her own father into a mad, dark stalker, is dredged up as she seeks to save her 
friend: the boy she never meets in the waking world. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing boring about "Paperhouse." The sound track and images keep 
working you up, squeezing out cold sweat. Obviously, director Bernard Rose saw 
the novel's central conceit, that dreams come true, as a visual springboard. 
And, though he and script writer Matthew Jacobs haven't delved far into the 
psychology -- haven't really made Anna's dilemma real -- they've had a field 
day with the dreams, the crazy surfaces, the hallucinatory edges. 
</P>
<P>
These dreams -- the horrific paternal assault, the mysterious bicycles, 
helicopters and ice-cream machines -- are like Andrew Wyeth under ether, like 
crisp, deep TV-ad visions out of Dali and de Chirico. The photographic style, 
by Rose and cinematographer Mike Southon (Ken Russell's "Gothic") probably owes 
as much to Rose's career in rock videos, as Southon's taste for Hammer horror 
movies. In their eyes, both nightmare and real world have a diamond-hard 
brightness, sliding into the terrifying, skewed emptiness of the dream fields 
surrounding Anna's paper house and a huge phallic lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The child actress who plays Anna, Charlotte Burke, may be too old for the part. 
She is 13, perhaps playing 11, but the drawings she has supposedly made look 
like the work of a 6- or 7-year-old. Still, Burke she has an admirable 
resilience and energy; so does Spiers. And the adults around her have a scarily 
equivocal quality: Glenne Headly, the corrupt ingenue of "Dirty Rotten 
Scoundrels" as her too-rational mother, Ben Cross of "Chariots of Fire" as her 
night-and-day father, Gemma Jones as her skeptical doctor. 
</P>
<P>
The ideas here aren't new. Postwar '40s British films often took us into these 
dream worlds and childhood realms. But the technology is, as recent dream-films 
like "Time Bandits" or "Dreamchild" have already shown. The movie all but 
attacks you, largely through its lethally sharp images, and a music score by 
Hans Zimmer ("Rain Man") and Stanley Myers that is full of dark jags, edges and 
harsh screams too. "Paperhouse" (PG-13, despite intense, nightmarish scenes) 
puts up an impeccable surface, rips it up, reveals a hell underneath; an 
incongruous paper world of flesh and paint, blood and fire, oceans of tears.

'FLETCH LIVES' TAKES BAD JOKES, BAD TASTE TO DEEP SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Fletch Lives" (citywide) is the ultimate comedy of condescension, a movie with 
a hero whose every other line of dialogue is a snide wisecrack directed at a 
fool. In this meager sequel, as in its popular predecessor, Chevy Chase 
demolishes every easy target in sight with a quip of the tongue. Some of the 
lines are funny, but after a while you just want to smack him. 
</P>
<P>
The original "Fletch" film nearly four years ago had Chase, as investigative 
reporter Irwin Fletcher, sardonically reducing everyone and everything in Los 
Angeles to its proper level. Having exhausted all possible prey for his comic 
patronization in this town, what better place to go next and be painfully 
superior about than the Deep South? Uh-oh. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Louisiana, land of obese lawmen, sex-hungry belles, KKK goons, 
crooked TV evangelists, redneck motorcycle gangs, 'possum hunters, plain folks 
who like to dress up in Confederate regalia and enough suckers to keep P.T. 
Barnum in business for five lifetimes. Everyone there has two first names -- 
Jim Bob, Joe Jack, Cindy Mae and almost every other possible combination except 
John Paul. 
</P>
<P>
These dusty cliches are set up like big plastic ducks in a shooting gallery by 
screenwriter Leon Capetanos, to be knocked flat by cosmopolitan Chevy, who 
isn't playing a character (least of all the character first created by novelist 
Gregory McDonald) so much as reprising his nonplussed, punchline-spouting 
"Weekend Update" anchor role. 
</P>
<P>
This jester ends up in Louisiana after inheriting a mansion from his recently 
deceased aunt. It's a given that our hero will offer more rejoinders than 
remorse about the aunt. It's a little more shocking when, 20 minutes into the 
movie, its most appealing character (a sexy Southern lawyer played by Patricia 
Kalember) is killed off as she lies in bed next to Fletch, and all he can do 
when the police show up is crack jokes. 
</P>
<P>
But sleep with him another woman does, knockout real estate agent Becky Ann 
Culpepper (Julianne Phillips, she of the angel face and wildly wavering 
accent), whose land-grubbing TV-preacher father just happens to be a prime 
suspect in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
It's a brilliant stroke of casting to have R. Lee Ermey -- the formidable drill 
sergeant of "Full Metal Jacket" -- take on the role of evangelist Jimmy Lee 
Farnsworth. And when the picture finally gets to this fake faith-healer's 
massive church, it looks all set to take off into satirical set-piece heaven. 
The atrocious baby-blue color scheme of the set design and suits (from costume 
designer Anna Hill Johnstone and five art directors) is hysterical and -- for 
any students of the TBN or PTL cable networks -- dead on-target. 
</P>
<P>
There's more reason to be hopeful still: Director Michael Ritchie is the man 
who took on such American institutions as politics ("The Candidate"), juvenile 
sports ("Bad News Bears"), beauty pageants ("Smile") and est seminars 
("Semi-Tough") in the '70s. Why not institutionalized religion now? 
</P>
<P>
But this is the Michael Ritchie of the '80s, a coaster more apt to cook up 
gilded turkeys like "The Golden Child" and last year's career low, "The Couch 
Trip." This Ritchie lets sophomoric scatology predominate over satire at every 
turn, and even in the two church scenes -- including an amusing bit with Fletch 
impersonating a guest healer -- the gags are more crass than corrosive. The 
whole dumb mess bottoms out (so to speak) when a parishioner pulls down his 
pants to show the congregation his hemorrhoids. 
</P>
<P>
Comedy this smug is bound to find its TV-weaned audience, but moviegoers might 
think twice about signing on as the film makers' partners in put-down when 
they're clearly also its targets. It's a also a bad sign of the faith Ritchie 
and editor Richard A. Harris have in their audiences when every time Chase does 
something funny with his hands, they cut to a closeup of the hands -- as if 
they're afraid we might miss the gag. 
</P>
<P>
Beware: "Fletch Lives" (MPAA-rated PG, in spite of its raunchy-mindedness) may 
assume that all Southerners are dim bulbs, but it doesn't think you're so 
bright yourself.

SKID ROW ARTISTS VOICE HOPES FOR $20-MILLION L.A. ENDOWMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Henry Brown, a homeless man painting a mural on Skid Row, has a dream shared by 
many from the blighted area who met there Wednesday to discuss their hopes for 
the new $20-million Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see a place I can go and work, where I can refine my talent and 
get materials," said Brown, one of about 100 gathered at the East 6th Street 
office of the Homeless Outreach Program, a service organization. 
</P>
<P>
"You see all those unfinished drawings?" he said, pointing to a wall where his 
works were hung. "That's all you're ever going to see without a place to go. 
Unfinished drawings." 
</P>
<P>
The endowment, which could increase municipal arts funding from about $5 
million to $25 million, won't be fully operational for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
But some of its funds, to be generated through fees on most non-residential 
private development, city capital improvements and money from the city's 
general fund, will be available around July. And, as city officials begin to 
design endowment spending plans and overall policy, hundreds in the local art 
community are gathering to voice their concerns about how the money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting, arranged by Barbara Frost, an organizer of the homeless, 
was the third of such forums attended by Al Nodal, general manager of the 
city's Cultural Affairs Department and chief endowment administrator. Though 
this group was smaller than the gatherings already held by black artists and a 
new group calling itself the Arts Congress, many of its members had a vision -- 
the revitalization of Skid Row through art -- that was no less grand. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists should be at the vanguard of the transformation of Skid Row" where 
"life has lost meaning" for many, said Frost, who has lived on Skid Row since 
September and was a missionary in Central America for 17 years. She has been 
supervising the painting of Brown's surreal, spiritually-themed mural on a 
building facing 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for a people's cultural center" offering classes, 
exhibitions and performances, she said, echoing Brown's desire. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Casey had expansive ideas too. He talked about making the area a place 
people will want to come and suggested that the endowment should pay jugglers, 
magicians and mimes to create street festivals like those in New Orleans. Casey 
is the founder of Another Planet, a wildly decorated converted gas station at 
the corner of Wall and Boyd streets that is part homeless hangout, part 
"cultural communications center" with poetry readings, video screenings, chess 
games and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
"That potential to bring downtown alive is right here, right here in the heart 
of L.A.," said Casey, who wore what looked like a clear plastic motorcycle 
helmet adorned with silver sequins and a large, blinking eye. 
</P>
<P>
Others spoke of needs heard repeatedly at the two previous endowment meetings. 
Funds should be used to pay individual artists, to fund working and living 
spaces, and for art programs in prisons, halfway houses and mental hospitals, 
and for the youth and elderly, they said. 
</P>
<P>
While most of those at the meeting were not known artists -- indeed, many were 
homeless -- others who shared their concerns for the area represented 
established groups, including three theater organizations, the TheatreWorker's 
Project, Pipeline Inc., which recently closed two downtown theaters, and Spring 
Street's Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
Nodal, credited with helping to revitalize crime-ridden MacArthur Park through 
a widely acclaimed community art program he launched there in 1983, told those 
gathered that the endowment was designed to support historically underfunded 
areas of Los Angeles, such as Skid Row, and that "art can be a tool to help 
cities deal with urban issues." 
</P>
<P>
"This city has realized that art can help the city address many of the problems 
we face. . . . We want the endowment to marry community needs and artistic 
needs." 
</P>

HARVEY, COLLINS IN 'SWAN LAKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final "Swan Lake" of the current American Ballet Theatre season introduced 
a promising new partnership Wednesday in Shrine Auditorium: company principal 
Cynthia Harvey and corps member Jeremy Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Because she danced Odette-Odile two years ago in an exhaustive Royal Ballet 
reconstruction of the 1895 St. Petersburg "Swan Lake," Harvey is now one of the 
few dancers anywhere to know the full, authentic Petipa-Ivanov choreography 
rather than a modern adaptation. 
</P>
<P>
The experience may have heightened her sense of classicism. Not only did she 
look technically faultless in the Baryshnikov version on Wednesday, but her 
dancing remained free of the Soviet mannerisms adopted by some of her 
colleagues and often proved breathtaking in purity of style. 
</P>
<P>
However, the feathery softness of her legato dancing as Odette, the exquisite 
refinement of her virtuosity as Odile, did not mask Harvey's inconsistent 
mastery of expressive values. Some moments were strongly realized, others 
merely sketched in. 
</P>
<P>
Well on his way to becoming a fine partner, Collins had obviously been 
carefully coached in aristocratic deportment and suavity of articulation. 
</P>
<P>
But the lessons appeared far from second nature in his portrayal of Siegfried: 
There were over-eager and over-finicky mime passages, lapses of control in 
solos and a general callowness of interpretation. Still, anyone this tall and 
nobly proportioned won't be allowed to fail in American ballet, so Collins will 
undoubtedly have more chances to polish and deepen his art.LEWIS SEGAL

UNEVEN, UNLIKELY SEQUEL IN 'HEART OUTRIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Medoff's "The Heart Outright" (at the Lex), a pair of one-acts focusing on 
the same character, is a strange sort of sequel. 
</P>
<P>
The character is Stephen Ryder, appropriated from Medoff's first major success, 
"When You Comin' Back, Red Ryder?" (1973). Before intermission, it's 1979 and 
Stephen addresses the audience in a monologue. Afterwards, it's 1983, and 
Stephen is in a conventionally realistic play, complete with the fourth wall 
separating the actors from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The first act is less of a sequel than the second, with fewer references to the 
incidents of "Red Ryder," and it's more successful. Living in Austin, Tex., 
Stephen runs a porno movie theater, but he does it honorably. He takes pride in 
his theater, if not in the movies he shows. As he talks to the audience, he 
meticulously cleans the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The play portrays a man who desperately clings to certain values because they 
give him sustenance, not because they help accomplish anything in the outside 
world, which appears to be sinking slowly into the mire. The inherent irony is 
hammered home a little too hard by actor Brett Cullen, but the performance is 
undeniably engaging. 
</P>
<P>
One quibble about John Iacovelli's set: the movie posters in the lobby are 
sexually teasing ads for mainstream movies, not porno flicks. Why would Stephen 
help promote the competition? 
</P>
<P>
In the second half of "The Heart Outright," Stephen has returned to his 
hometown in New Mexico, where "Red Ryder" was set, for his mother's funeral. 
He's about to board a bus back to Texas when he's accosted by former classmate 
Dick Turpin (Willie Garson) who now manages the bus station; by Angel (Lauren 
Tewes), who liked him back in 1969 and still pines for him; and by his greedy 
ex-stepfather (Will MacMillan). 
</P>
<P>
Primarily through the character of Dick, Medoff misrepresents our impression of 
Stephen from "Red Ryder." In Dick's eyes, Stephen became a hero in the events 
depicted in "Red Ryder," when he and Angel were among the hostages briefly held 
by an outlaw in the diner where they worked. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there's no reason why anyone -- even dim Dick -- would think of 
Stephen that way at the end of "Red Ryder" or thereafter. Yes, during "Ryder" 
he makes one abortive attempt to overpower the gunman of that play, but it's an 
attempt accurately described by the gunman himself as "inept." After the bad 
guy leaves, Stephen is seen hitching a ride out of town. 
</P>
<P>
So the second half of "The Heart Outright" inflates Stephen's reputation only 
to turn around and deflate it, to show us his shortcomings -- something we've 
already seen. Why bother? 
</P>
<P>
The second half works better when Stephen is dealing with Angel instead of 
Dick. The Stephen-Angel exchanges are less contrived. And Tewes' assured 
performance as the quickly aging Angel is rather affecting, especially when 
contrasted with Garson's annoyingly mannered overplaying of his overwritten 
role. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen, meanwhile, tones down Stephen during intermission -- maybe because he 
no longer carries the play by himself -- and creates a skillfully restrained 
characterization of a cynical but upright guy.

'NORTH STAR' DOESN'T SHINE FOR COMPANY OF ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phoenix-like, Company of Angels has re-emerged from the ashes left by a fire 
that destroyed its original 29-year-old Hollywood home. Its new Silver Lake 
location is a far more comfortable abode. A happy story -- especially in these 
lean times for small theater. The unhappy news is the play going on inside, 
Sanford Clark's "Looking For The North Star." 
</P>
<P>
It was perhaps too much to expect that a new physical plant would bring a new 
aesthetic outlook to Company of Angels. "Looking for the North Star" is one 
more entry in a long string of mediocre, early draft efforts, usually one-acts 
dropping a couple of characters into tragicomic circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances in this case are for the most part ludicrous, barely comic 
and only tragic if you can swallow the rest. A dim, somewhat defenseless man 
named Bobby (author Clark) picks up Sheri (Suanne Spoke), a wanton-looking 
woman hitchhiking on the highway out of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of this hour-plus "road play" repeats ad nauseam variations on 
Sheri manipulating Bobby's emotions, guilts and weak spots. What's initially 
clever (his good Samaritanism is twisted into the act of a lecher, for 
instance) becomes a belabored and hackneyed dramatizing of an essentially 
sexist conceit. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: Sheri is the self-admitted hysterical hooker, willing to blow her 
brains out, thus making us side with Bobby in his attempts to put his foot 
down. Who does she think she is? Who's driving this car, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
But this is all a mere ruse to draw us into yet another bad play about . . . 
AIDS. All we will tell you here is Clark's clunky foreshadowing method: Bobby, 
it seems, learned as a young boy that he could put irreversibly injured animals 
out of their misery. And another thing: "Looking for the North Star" ends in -- 
yes -- Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
This is at best an actors' exercise, but neither Spoke nor Clark makes it into 
a workout. Clark has a fix on Bobby's hangdog personality, but his passivity 
isn't made interesting. Contemporary theater is so awash in hooker characters, 
with so few of distinction (the women in "Etta Jenks" being an exception), that 
Spoke's performance threatens to vanish before our eyes even as we're seeing 
it. She seems bored with the assignment, perhaps not buying the hysteric 
cliches even more than we are. To be sure, director Carol Ries has lit no 
sparks under her cast. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, during a seminar on the future of theater at the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center, playwright Eduardo Machado told of his futurist 
nightmare -- that the only plays being done were with two characters. It would 
be nice to see a company on stage at the Company of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake, on Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., through 
April 15. Tickets: $10; (213) 466-1767.

AILEY'S 'OPUS MCSHANN' GIVEN ITS L.A. PREMIERE AT WILTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, Alvin Ailey fashioned a valentine to Charlie Parker, "For Bird 
-- With Love," that replayed moments from the jazzman's difficult life in 
broadly drawn dramatic scenes set to music by Parker and others. 
</P>
<P>
In a curtain speech before Wednesday night's performance by the Alvin Ailey 
American Dance Theater at the Wiltern Theatre, the choreographer explained that 
his new tribute to Kansas City jazz pianist Jay McShann was a "prelude" to the 
earlier piece. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the two works back-to-back made the connection clear in terms of 
individual details, like the reappearance of the McShann figure as the 
Progenitor in "Bird." Yet "Opus McShann" (a Los Angeles premiere) veered off in 
an unfocused and dramatically miscalculated fashion. 
</P>
<P>
It opens with a figure in a fuchsia satin suit (Dudley Williams) who settles 
himself on a chair on top of a platform painted like a piano and proceeds to 
mime McShann-the-performer to one of his vintage recordings. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the scene becomes a lively bordello with teasing women and predatory men 
(the setting of McShann's earliest musical life). Two guys (Carl Bailey and 
Gary DeLoatch) do a nifty jelly-legged, stumble-step set piece. Eventually, 
with the why-not logic of musical comedy, there is a spate of jitterbugging 
(choreographed by swing dancers Frank Manning and Norma Miller). 
</P>
<P>
But peculiar sounds begin to emanate from the tape, heralding the arrival of 
four members of the Ku Klux Klan in their white robes and pointed hats. They 
frighten the dancers away. McShann gestures at them in a rather grand and 
stately manner and they rapidly take their leave. Then everybody comes back and 
it's on with the show. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to combine the whorehouse ambiance with the look of popular dances 
from the '30s and a mini-morality play about the way black society carried on 
despite threats by segregationists pulls the piece in too many directions. It 
doesn't illuminate the essential nature of the composer whose music we're 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
And while "To Bird" has at least a few sharply etched pure-dance moments -- 
like the ecstatic writhing of a woman across a church bench -- virtually all 
the bits and pieces of dancing in "Opus McShann" seem on the same uninflected 
level of genial entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the all-Ailey program were two familiar repertory items: "Streams" 
(1970), in a finely articulated performance, and "A Song for You" from "Love 
Songs," (1972), with Williams communicating in eloquent arm-language.

CD CORNER: BOWIE'S LPS RETURN ON RYKODISC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The CD wait will soon be over for David Bowie fans. 
</P>
<P>
While copies of the English rock star's recent EMI albums, including the 
best-selling "Let's Dance," are plentiful on CD shelves, his more celebrated 
RCA material has been unavailable for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
Rykodisc -- the independent label that started out as a CD-only firm, but now 
also releases product in vinyl and cassette -- has obtained the North American 
rights to those 18 RCA albums released between 1969 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The titles include such acclaimed works as "Hunky Dory," "Ziggy Stardust," 
"Aladdin Sane" and "Low" -- as well as two greatest-hits packages. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the albums were released on CD in 1984 by RCA, they had largely 
disappeared from stores by the end of 1985 because the rights reverted to Bowie 
and RCA could no longer fill re-order requests. 
</P>
<P>
Don Rose, president of Ryko, said he believes Bowie chose Ryko over larger 
labels because of the aggressive way the company has marketed more than a dozen 
Frank Zappa albums and two Jimi Hendrix collections. No financial details were 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition is a coup for Ryko because of the large demand for the Bowie 
LPs. In a Billboard magazine survey last fall, record retailers indicated there 
was more consumer demand for Bowie's greatest hits package, "Changesonebowie," 
than any other album not available on CD. The "Ziggy Stardust" album finished 
second in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Anne Svingen, a spokeswoman for Ryko, said this week that wherever 
possible the Bowie CDs will contain additional tracks -- either previously 
unreleased material or non-LP singles from the same period. 
</P>
<P>
No decision has been made yet on the order in which the albums will be 
released, but they are expected to be released at the rate of one or two a 
month, with the first arriving in stores in the fall, Svingen said. 
</P>
<P>
Other albums that CD fans would most like to see available in CD, according to 
the Billboard survey: Queen's "Greatest Hits" (available now only in an import 
CD), the Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds" (after many delays, Capitol is now planning a 
summer release) and Peter Gabriel's first solo album (now available in a budget 
package from Atlantic).

THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barcelona-born painter Eugenia Tusquets, who has lived in San Francisco for the 
past nine years, has a coolly decorative neo-Realist approach and a fondness 
for sealing off space with an expanse of textured wall that seems 
quintessentially Spanish. Against these walls, she poses "interesting"-looking 
young women, either grave ivory-skinned damsels, generally dressed in black, or 
more individualistic, ethnic-looking faces. 
</P>
<P>
A Moroccan fabric border runs across the top of "Alter Ego 2," in which a 
full-cheeked girl poses in profile at the lower edge of a painterly brown wall 
and reappears -- in a faceless fragmentary view -- at the extreme left-hand 
edge. In "Mi-Ombre," a swatch of painted green, yellow and brown pattern 
running up the right-hand side of the diptych matches the fabric in the dress 
worn by an attractive woman with long black hair posing against a bronze-tinged 
wall with a granular texture. 
</P>
<P>
This figurative approach runs the risk of being too dependant on superficial 
values: the sweetened physical appeal of the sitters and the modish severity of 
their surroundings. But Tusquets also locates a certain theatricality in most 
of these scenes -- mostly through posture and placement of the figure -- and 
makes her mark as a personable stylist. (Ivey Gallery, 154 N. La Brea Ave., to 
March 29.) CATHY CURTIS

THE YACHT CLUB GIVES NOSTALGIA A FRESH SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture this: Four guys walk on stage wearing blue blazers, pearl gray pants 
and enough hair pomade to launch the Queen Mary. They zip into a briskly-paced 
vocal number that drips with echoes of Bing Crosby and the Rhythm Kings. 
</P>
<P>
A throwback to the rah-rah, pre-World War II college years? Escapees from 
Disneyland? The ultimate in nostalgia music? 
</P>
<P>
The Palm Springs Yacht Club, appearing at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel's 
Cinegrill on Tuesday night, was a bit of all those things. More to the point, 
however, the four-piece ensemble used its superb blend of musical skills to 
bring off an ingenious theatrical gimmick. Dipping into a wealth of whimsical, 
humorous, highly topical pieces from the past -- with references to everyone 
from Fats Waller and Louis Jourdan to Crosby and Hoagy Carmichael -- the 
foursome constructed a non-stop evening of off-the-wall music that was as 
deceptively creative as it was up-front entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
There were so many high points that it's almost impossible to list them all. 
Bob Reitmeier's briskly fluid clarinet wove in and out of all the pieces, with 
special prominence in high-flying improvisational whirls through "I Know That 
You Know," "Caravan" and "Running Wild." 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist John Reynolds and drummer Matt Johnson displayed a full range of 
skills -- from airy, tenor vocalizing to solid musical support. Johnson, 
playing only a snare and cymbal, got more variety from his limited resources 
than some drummers would from a full battery of instruments.

The PSYC's most versatile member, however, was bassist Westy Westenhoffer. 
Switching from upright bass to baritone horn to over-the-shoulder tuba, he was 
a jack-of-all-trades, man-of-all-seasons. His romp through the audience 
carrying his tuba, pumping out a samba rhythm to "Brazil," had to be seen to be 
believed. Even better was his vibrating-lips-on-the-back-of-his-hands version 
of "Edelweiss." 
</P>
<P>
There were other remarkable moments: A romantic ballad titled "October in 
Oxnard"; a radio commercial with the theme song, "Love Is Like a Cigarette"; 
the down-home blues, "I'm a Hog for You, Baby."

The Palm Springs Yacht Club show, very simply, is something not to be missed.

You can have your pick this weekend at the video store: recent movies or old 
movies. There are several of each among the new releases. 
</P>
<P>
First, four major motion pictures that played theaters in 1988: 
</P>
<P>
"Punchline" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R) examines the lives of two aspiring 
comedians. Tom Hanks and Sally Field star in the late '88 release, which The 
Times' Sheila Benson found "bold, sneaky and brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
"Clean and Sober" (Warner, $89.95, R) places Michael Keaton in a rare serious 
role as a man trying to escape addiction to alcohol and other drugs. Benson 
wrote that the drama has "a quality of risk and an urgency to the story that 
sweeps almost every quibble away." 
</P>
<P>
"Moon Over Parador" (MCA, $89.95, PG-13) has Richard Dreyfuss as an unemployed 
actor who winds up impersonating the director of a Caribbean country. The 
comedy was directed by Paul Mazursky ("Down and Out in Beverly Hills"), who 
"keeps you entertained even when the movie isn't quite working," said Michael 
Wilmington in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Crocodile Dundee II" (Paramount, $89.95, PG) picks up where "Croc I" left off, 
with Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan) in the Big Apple, but the action and comedy move 
back to Australia. The $109 million-grossing movie is "almost as much fun as 
the first," wrote Kevin Thomas in The Times. It's "nothing special as an action 
adventure but shrewdly effective as a projection of a mythical hero." 
</P>
<P>
The oldies but goodies are led by a true classic, Preston Sturges' "Sullivan's 
Travels" (MCA, $29.95). Possibly the most significant of the director-writer's 
several great '40s comedies, this 1941 masterpiece is a brave blend of the 
slapstick, the serious and several moods in between; a Hollywood director (Joel 
McCrea) and friend (Veronica Lake) disguise themselves as tramps to find out 
what the "real" America is like. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, another movie notable for going against the grain of the 
standard Hollywood script is also being released this week on video -- at its 
restored, original length and in letter-box format. Far less successful than 
Sturges' film, and actually quite irritating at times, Martin Scorsese's "New 
York, New York" (MGM/UA, $29.95) is still fascinating for its attempt to 
portray a central character (Robert De Niro) who's obnoxious from the start, 
for its Big Band-era setting and for certain stylistic touches. Liza Minnelli 
plays the long-suffering mate. 
</P>
<P>
Other movies of interest newly on tape: "The Chocolate War" (M.C.E.G./Forum, 
$89.95, R, 1988), "The General Died at Dawn" (MCA, $29.95, 1936) with Gary 
Cooper, "Reap the Wild Wind" (MCA, $29.95, 1942) starring John Wayne, "A Date 
with Judy" (MGM/UA, $19.95, 1948) featuring Jane Powell, and "Neptune's 
Daughter" (MGM/UA, $19.95, 1949) with Esther Williams. OTHER VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
"Shirley MacLaine's Inner Workout" (Vestron, $29.98, 70 minutes) may do for New 
Age stress-reduction techniques what Jane Fonda's workouts did for aerobics. 
MacLaine's meditation methods are based on the Hindu system of chakras, the 
seven "spinning wheels of energy" that lie, according to theory, within every 
person. It may sound loopy to most Westerners, but the actress and author gives 
a clear, concise explanation before moving into the valuable "inner workouts." 
Highly recommended. 
</P>
<P>
The simple special effects that help MacLaine illustrate her points were 
supplied by video artist Ken Jenkins, who has his own new tape out. There's 
nothing simple about the abstract, ever-moving images that make up his 
"Illumination" (Immediate Future Productions, $29.95). The half-hour tape is a 
continuously astounding video kaleidoscope. Information: (800) 727-0009.TERRY

HOME TECH: WHY B-MOVIES ARE HARDER TO FIND AT YOUR VIDEO STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are B-movies going down the drain in the home-video market? 
</P>
<P>
They've definitely been on the decline in the last few years. According to a 
recent study by the Fairfield Group, there was a 10% drop in dealer purchases 
of B-movies last year. Another study, by Vidmark Communications, showed dealers 
ordered 23% fewer B-titles last year. 
</P>
<P>
Though there's no standard definition of a B-movie, it's basically a film that 
has had little or no exposure in theaters, has been minimally advertised and 
usually lacks name actors -- movies such as "Buy and Cell," "Good Night, God 
Bless" and "Going Undercover." They often are low-budget films that boast lots 
of sex, action, adventure and violence. 
</P>
<P>
A more practical way to describe B-movies: those that retailers purchase only 
after they've stocked up on the big A titles, such as "Die Hard," "Three Men 
and a Baby," "E.T." and "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
Though it's consumers seeking variety who suffer when retailers order fewer 
B-movies, it was consumer gripes that helped trigger the decline of the Bs. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, consumers were complaining about long waits to get copies of 
hit movies. So retailers, frightened by the specter of all those dissatisfied 
customers, got into the habit of stocking up on A titles. They then had less 
money to spend on B-movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers were scared of losing customers," said Paul Culberg, president of 
New World, one of the video companies that specialize in B-movies (others 
include Prism, Magnum and Vidmark). "The major video companies preyed on that 
fear. So retailers started buying up A titles. In the last four years, there's 
been an incredible drop in B-movies sales to retailers. They're about 25% of 
the market now. About four years ago, they were at least 50%." 
</P>
<P>
Stocking up on A-titles was also attractive to retailers because it meant fewer 
gambles. "Part of it was going for the sure thing," said Jack Talley, director 
of sales for Celebrity Home Entertainment, which recently decided to bow out of 
the B-movie business. "Why should a retailer take a chance on a B-movie when he 
could buy a few more copies of a sure thing? It's just harder and harder to get 
retailers to buy B-titles." 
</P>
<P>
Retailers buy A titles based on factors such as box-office figures -- still the 
most popular gauge of rental success -- the drawing power of the cast and the 
amount of advertising and promotion the film had in its original release. 
High-grossing films or heavily promoted movies boasting name stars are 
generally the most popular rentals. 
</P>
<P>
But when buying B-movies, retailer Lou Berg of Houston's Audio-Video Plus 
noted, there are no sure-fire gauges: 
</P>
<P>
"You look at things like packaging and genre (action/adventure movies are the 
most popular rentals). But you're still guessing. If you're a retailer and 
you're confronted with buying a movie that was never released, that you've 
never heard of, starring actors you don't know, what do you do? For many 
retailers, it's easier to just ignore the B-movie and buy a couple more copies 
of the latest hit." 
</P>
<P>
B-movies are usually $10-$30 cheaper than A-titles but that hasn't been much of 
an incentive to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
There are some signs that the attitude among retailers about B-movies is 
changing. "I think the decline has flattened for B-movies and there may be an 
8-10% increase this year," New World's Culberg predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Several industry officials contend it's simple consumer demand for 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
"Variety is more important to renters than some retailers think," said Sam 
Pirnazar, vice president of Vidmark Entertainment. "People still like to take 
chances on movies they don't know a lot about. When they go to a video store 
they like to have a choice when they're not in the mood for the latest hit. 
That's where B-movies come in."

GIORGIO'S PLACE SERVES NEARLY FLAWLESS ITALIAN IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Grotte, they'd tell me, La Grotte. Must go to La Grotte, that 
gastro-landmark of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
I never got to La Grotte at its old location, though, and now that the landmark 
has moved, I still haven't been there. I have tried. I found the address and 
everything, but I got sidetracked without knowing it. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that when you enter La Grotte's new location on the plaza level 
of the Arco Center, La Grotte itself is hidden behind a second door. Unless you 
know that, you might sit down in the high-ceilinged, salmon-colored room with 
lots of windows that turns out to be another restaurant with the same owner, 
Giorgio's Place. 
</P>
<P>
However, Giorgio's Place has a spiffy Italian menu full of up-to-date items: 
carpaccio sprinkled with celery leaf, spinach and goat cheese salad, fried 
brains with squash blossoms and so on. I had a particularly nice appetizer of 
strips of grilled chicken breast marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar 
accompanied by grilled -- indeed, still hot -- slices of eggplant and a little 
thatch of radicchio. In short, I never got to La Grotte. 
</P>
<P>
Giorgio's is a sensible place and makes a sensible practice of serving its 
pasta dishes as entrees at lunch. This does lead to an odd situation, though. 
At dinner the pasta dishes are called primi piatti and the meat dishes secondi 
piatti. At lunch, this puts the "first plates" at the end of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
The pasta dishes make perfect sense as light entrees, in any case. Stracciette 
are delicate, practically paper-thin squares of pasta in a light tomato sauce 
flavored with ham, and the tagiolini al pesto tend to come with unannounced 
chunks of asparagus. There's a faultless risotto with the crunchy/creamy 
texture that often eludes our Italian restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
I'd pass on the penne with broccoli, though. They could use something, probably 
the garlic and anchovies the menu promises but scarcely delivers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entrees, a couple have unusual sauces based on pureed vegetables: 
salmon in a buttery celery puree, and chicken breast in a pleasing sauce of 
pureed asparagus, the strips of chicken laid out with asparagus spears in a 
pattern that looks like a surreal crab. For that matter, one of the appetizers, 
a sort of cheese-and-sweet pepper pate, is surrounded by a thick and 
surprisingly tasty sauce made from pureed fresh fava beans. 
</P>
<P>
Fish dominate the rest of the menu, and are generally very good. I liked the 
two-tone construction of sole layered on salmon in a grainy lobster sauce. But 
it must be said that the whitefish with its loud accompaniment of eggplant and 
olives, nice though it is, could have been made with any fish, or no fish at 
all. And that pork chop with garlic sauce was actually pretty flavorless. 
</P>
<P>
No problem with the desserts, though. The Bavarian cream, under an Italian 
name, was the lightest I've had in a restaurant for a long time. The tirami su, 
the apple tart in a mild chocolate-swirled cream sauce, and the cream puffs 
have to take a back seat to it. 
</P>
<P>
As for the real La Grotte, I did get a peek inside it once. It looked 
romantically dim and crowded. I'll go there, someday . . . maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio's Place, Arco Center, 300 Oceangate, Long Beach, (213) 432-6175. Open 
for lunch Monday through Friday, for dinner daily. Full bar. Valet parking. All 
major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $45 to $74.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: FOOD, FOOD, FOOD AT CABO CABO CABO

The waitress removed the plate. The fact that it was still full did not seem to 
distress her. "Ooh," she said as she bore it away, "is that pasta?" I told her 
it was calamari. She nodded. "I looked down at it when I picked it up from the 
kitchen," she said, "and there were these little feet -- you know, the 
tentacles -- waving in the air. And I thought, like, how can people eat that 
stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
Most people at the wonderfully colorful Cabo Cabo Cabo in the Century City 
Marketplace, (213) 552-2226, probably won't be eating that stuff. They'll be 
pigging out on the all-you-can-eat fajitas ($7.95), indulging in huge 
hamburgers ($5.95 with a big heap of curlicue French fries), or eating the 
grilled fish, the gigantic salads or the pizzas cooked in the wood-burning 
oven. And they'll be drinking; there are 50 beers, 40 tequilas, and just about 
every other sort of alcoholic beverage you've ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
This is, as you can see, a restaurant that leaves no taste unmet. And no 
wonder. The owners are Marlene Morris (of Panama Red's), Bob Morris (of R.J.'s, 
Gladstone's, etc.) and Bryant Morris (of Raging Waters Park). They've put 
together a virtual theme park of a place here, and if you aren't having fun, 
it's not because they're not trying.RUTH REICHL

FOCUS ON: ANIMATION: GALLERY STRIKES ANIMATED POSE FOR CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1930s, animators spent hundreds of hours painstakingly drawing thousands 
of pictures on celluloid to create a single Mickey Mouse cartoon, only to have 
their work destroyed after the cartoon was filmed. Today, those same cels often 
bring tens of thousands of dollars at auction, where they have become a hot 
commodity among art collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, a collector paid $121,000 for a black and white Mickey Mouse cel 
from the 1934 cartoon "The Orphan's Benefit." It shows Mickey, hand to mouth, 
shouting across a stage. The image is among the most renowned in animation art. 
</P>
<P>
Prices will be more reasonable Saturday night when Circle Gallery in Old Town 
opens sales on 200 original cels from "Oliver &amp; Company," Walt Disney 
Pictures' 27th animated feature, released last November. A reception will be 
held from 6 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The film is an animated version of Dickens' classic, set in modern-day 
Manhattan. It follows the adventures of Oliver the kitten, who is befriended by 
a gang of wily dogs headed by Dodger and their human master, Fagin. 
</P>
<P>
Before production began, photographers shot New York street scenes from a dog's 
perspective -- 18 inches off the ground. The effect is similar to "Lady and the 
Tramp," the first animated movie shot from an animal's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the opening-night proceeds will benefit the San Diego Humane Society. 
Because the feature revolves around the lives of stray dogs and cats, Circle 
Gallery director Barbara Cox chose the humane society as recipient. 
</P>
<P>
A team of 300 artists and technicians worked 2 1/2 years to create the 
hand-drawn "Oliver &amp; Company." They produced more than a million story 
sketches and drawings for the 119,275 cels that make up the completed film. 
</P>
<P>
The cels will be introduced at prices ranging from $500 to $700 each, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Cel collecting came into vogue about 10 years ago, Cox said, but really took 
off in 1984 when Christie's and Sotheby's art auctioneers realized collectors' 
interest and began holding separate auctions for cels as they would for fine 
paintings or sculpture. Christie's holds twice-yearly cel auctions each June 
and November. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are thousands of casual collectors, serious cel buyers include 
Stephen Spielberg, George Lucas and Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I think animation art should be viewed as some of the best American art ever 
produced. I think it should be appreciated for its beauty," Joshua Arfer, head 
of animation art for Christie's, said in a recent article in Insight magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Early black and white cels are the most coveted and valuable of animation art, 
dealers say. Also in demand are cels from vintage Disney films such as "Snow 
White and the Seven Dwarfs," "Fantasia," "Bambi" and "Sleeping Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Even backgrounds used in the films, on which the characters are superimposed, 
are in demand, though for lesser sums. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the studios that now profit from the sales once considered cels a 
mere byproduct. Usually cels were washed and reused like old canvases, thrown 
away or sold for $1 per box of 100, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's opening at Circle Gallery will feature a demonstration and 
discussion by Ruben Aquino, chief animator on "Oliver &amp; Company." Aquino 
will explain the use of computers in animation. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will continue through April 15 at the gallery, at 2501 San Diego 
Ave. Hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday through Tuesday, and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Wednesday through Saturday.

AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: EXHIBIT HIGHLIGHTS THEATER DESIGNER'S CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Lewinson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theater designers, those artists who create the sets and costumes for the 
performing arts, face a peculiar situation unknown to their creative cousins in 
the fine arts, whose talents in painting, sculpture, even architecture, the 
theater designers combine. 
</P>
<P>
Like painter, the designers create images both realistic and abstract. Like 
sculptors, they create objects that are three-dimensional and free-standing. 
Like architects, they create at least the appearance of cities and building 
facades, and their structures must be engineered so they don't collapse and 
injure people. 
</P>
<P>
With all this, the costume design aspect only complicates the theater 
designer's responsibility, demanding a combination of talents unexpected of 
other artists. 
</P>
<P>
However, unlike other artists' works, the theater designer's art achieves its 
full realization not in the quiet timelessness of a gallery or museum 
exhibition but in the often frenetic and always ephemeral context of a 
performance in which the design is but one element serving in combination with 
action, dialogue, dance or song, all of which constitute distractions if one 
wishes to look at theater design as an art in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
This situation defines a kind of built-in frustration inherent in "Robert 
Israel: A Decade of Theatre Design," at UCSD's Mandeville Gallery (through 
April 9). On view are 57 drawings, paintings, photographs, blueprints, and 
costumes representing six major projects by Israel, an internationally known 
and widely honored designer who has been on the UCSD faculty since 1977 but 
will soon take a position at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
To look at the representations of any one of the productions as singularly 
exemplary and impressive relative to the others misses the point of the 
exhibition. It seems, in fact, that the show is set up intentionally to defy 
such an approach because it concerns itself more with presenting aspects of the 
design process than with trying to convey the final outcomes of that process. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, the presentations of Israel's designs for "The Yellow 
Sound," commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum and inspired by a previously 
unproduced 1913 libretto (or text) by Wassily Kandinsky, one of the giants of 
early modern art, with music by the contemporary composer Thomas DeHartmann. 
</P>
<P>
The story evolves from Russian mystical sources and deals with the continuity 
of the sensual and spiritual aspects of human life. To realize the production, 
Israel had to develop the scenic and costume elements called for by the text 
and suggested by the music. In the 20 or so sketches and drawings that Israel 
produced, we see yellow giants that look tree-like, a beautiful flower that is 
a character in its own right, a leaning bell tower, images of boulders, and 
representations of forms described on the drawings as "vague creatures" and 
"imprecise figures." 
</P>
<P>
The overall suggestion of the images as a group is decidedly mythic, even 
primeval. But we never actually hear the sound of the music or see these 
designs in their ultimate realization at full scale, with accompanying dialogue 
and action. There aren't even any photographs of the actual performance in 
progress, nor are any of the actual costumes displayed. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, this isn't oversight or cheapness on the part of the exhibition 
organizers because, on the other hand, Israel's work for Prokofiev's "Fiery 
Angel" is presented entirely in photographs, while his designs for "Mahagonny" 
-- an opera by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill -- appears only through a set of 
10 construction blueprints. Of Israel's work for the Philip Glass opera 
"Akhnaten," we see actual elements from the production itself, gold-leafed hawk 
and ibis masks, a silk gown and a headdress worn by the character of Nefertiti. 
</P>
<P>
Five sketches of these costumes are on view, but no other drawings, blueprints, 
or photos of other aspects of the production, either its preparation or final 
form, are displayed. The focus is similarly concentrated in the representations 
of another Philip Glass opera, "Satyagraha," an exploration of the evolution of 
Gandhi's ideas of nonviolent resistance. On view are five drawings showing the 
various characters' costumes, which consist of straightforward late 19th and 
early 20th century styles. 
</P>
<P>
The realism of the imagery from "Satyagraha" contrasts sharply with the 
fantastic and unnerving creations for "The Yellow Sound," which, in turn, 
displays a very different sensibility relative to the designs for "Akhnaten." 
So, the exhibition steps not only from style to style in expressing the breadth 
of Israel's responsibilities and creative as a theater designer. And it does 
this quietly and subtly, not with occasional dramatic images but with the sum 
of many images. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether the works on view bear up to scrutiny as "art" independent of 
their descriptive and documentary functions, argument could be made either way. 
But there's this: the drawings from "Satyagraha" are on loan to the exhibition 
from the collections of the Museum of Modern Art. Those from "The Yellow Sound" 
are on loan from the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Art Collection. And many other 
images and objects on view come from the Daniel Weinberg Gallery in Los Angeles 
and the Max Protetch Gallery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the line between these images from the realm of theater design and 
more conventionally understood visual art is difficult to find, if it exists at 
all.

<P>
The federal government on Thursday formally declared that it is safe for 
Americans to eat apples and strongly urged parents and school officials to 
restore the fruit to the diet of small children. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration, issued by top officials of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture, 
officially discounted a report charging that apples treated with the chemical 
daminozide pose a risk to children's health. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council lacked 
"scientific validity," the federal officials said. They pledged to work 
together to "reassure" the American public that apples are safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senate Hearing 
</P>
<P>
The government statement, presented at a hastily called Senate hearing on the 
issue, came after scores of school districts pulled apples and apple products 
from lunch menus this week and stores reported declines in apple purchases. 
</P>
<P>
FDA Commissioner Frank Young, who this week blocked imports of Chilean fruit 
after two cyanide-tainted grapes were found in a shipment, asserted that no 
similar action is warranted for apples treated with daminozide, which is 
marketed under the trade name Alar and is used to promote ripening in some 
apples. 
</P>
<P>
"As you've seen, if there is a problem, FDA will squarely address it," Young 
said. "If there is not a problem, FDA will squarely say that there is none." 
</P>
<P>
Some senators joined in decrying what Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) called the 
"hysteria and half-truths" spawned by the report, issued nearly three weeks ago 
by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. But other 
legislators and witnesses made clear that they share in the widespread concern 
about the substance. 
</P>
<P>
"What's a mother to do?" asked actress Meryl Streep, testifying in her role as 
head of Mothers and Others for Pesticide Limits. 
</P>
<P>
Given the conflicting reports, she testified, consumers lose confidence in 
products and citizens lose confidence in government. "As parents," she said 
ruefully, "we lose it completely." 
</P>
<P>
At the confrontational hearing, Streep and others urged that Alar's 
manufacturer, Uniroyal Chemical Co., immediately pull the product off the 
market so that consumers can be sure that all apples are safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Refuses 
</P>
<P>
But a company executive refused. "This is a truly remarkable product," said 
Uniroyal Vice President James A. Wylie Jr., "and it is a safe product." 
</P>
<P>
Daminozide has been found to cause cancer in some animals. The EPA has said it 
plans to ban the chemical -- which is used to promote ripening in an estimated 
5% to 10% of the U.S. apple crop -- by June, 1990, because of preliminary tests 
showing that it causes cancer in mice. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has the power to ban the chemical outright, as environmentalists and 
some legislators have urged. But the government officials testified that the 
amount of the chemical present in apples is too small to pose a health risk and 
that no action is justified until a scientific study is completed. 
</P>
<P>
If the "orderly scientific process" is not followed, Young warned, "we will be 
tossed in the wind as rudderless boats." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, by the Senate Labor Committee's panel on children, brought 
together for the first time the major parties involved in the dispute over 
apples. 
</P>
<P>
While the government agencies declared that Alar-treated apples pose no 
imminent threat, the Natural Resources Defense Council held to its position 
that apples, apple juice and other products containing the chemical pose an 
"unacceptable risk" to infants and small children, for whom apples are a 
dietary staple. 
</P>
<P>
That view was strongly endorsed by Rep. Gerry Sikorski (D-Minn.), who denounced 
what he called the "don't worry, be happy" attitude of the federal agencies who 
have refused to regulate the substance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assails Agency 
</P>
<P>
Sikorski, who has urged the EPA to ban Alar, charged that the agency "is 
turning American parents into the malevolent stepmother in Snow White, handing 
out enticingly red but fatal apples to our children." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a basket of apples and a jar of juice at his 
side, denounced such "panic," warning: "We're doing the nation a great 
disservice." 
</P>
<P>
The job of the Administration and Congress, agreed Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), 
is to exercise "crisis control." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from declarations by all sides that public health is a top priority, 
however, there was little agreement at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
While the Administration officials testified in defense of the apple, President 
Bush told reporters that he now drinks carrot juice because "it doesn't have 
any of that stuff they spray on the apples." 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses voiced concern about the apple industry, which Sen. Steven D. 
Symms (R-Ida.) said is as "dead as a doornail now right across America." 
</P>
<P>
But when Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) urged that Uniroyal halt sales of Alar so 
that apple growers could "market Alar-free products without the stigma of Alar 
attached," company executive Wylie steadfastly declined. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is really not Alar," he said. "The problem is an unreasonable fear 
that's been put in the minds of the American public." 
</P>
<P>
The result, warned Streep, is that consumers do not know what to believe about 
the safety of apples and apple products. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all seen the signs that say 'Alar-free,"' she said, "but none of them 
say: 'We've got Alar; come on down!' "

MAXICARE HEALTH INC. FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing increasing pressure from a long list of creditors, Maxicare Health Plans 
Inc. on Thursday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while it tries to 
work out a reorganization plan that would salvage at least part of what was 
once Wall Street's favorite health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it will continue to serve its members, including about 282,000 
in Southern California, and will pay its bills incurred after Thursday. But the 
filing created great confusion about the company's future among its members, 
client companies and health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
Peter J. Ratican, Maxicare's chairman and chief executive, said the filing will 
allow the company "to protect our operations while gaining the time to finalize 
and implement a plan for reorganization." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Los Angeles-based company said it is negotiating to sell 
its subsidiary serving about 320,000 Californians. The sale might make 
Maxicare's recovery from two years of huge losses more difficult because the 
California plan is Maxicare's most profitable. Previously, the company included 
California in a core group of operations that it intended to retain. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Maxicare's urgent need for cash led to a reassessment, industry 
analysts said. The California plan "is probably one of the few plans that's 
worth anything," said Bernard F. McDonagh, an analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp; 
Hopwood in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing was reportedly precipitated Wednesday, when the company's 
banks, led by Bankers Trust Co. of New York, vetoed Maxicare's acceptance of a 
new $15-million loan from an unnamed investor, according to Leon Marcus, the 
New York bankruptcy lawyer handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare filed its Chapter 11 petitions, covering subsidiaries in California, 
Washington, Arizona and 10 other states, in federal Bankruptcy Court in Santa 
Ana. Maxicare's HMO in Wisconsin is the only plan not affected by the filings. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chapter 11, a company and its subsidiaries may continue operating with 
protection from creditor demands. In that regard, Maxicare offered its critical 
network of independent health care providers some incentive to continue 
treating its members. The company pledged to pay them on time for all services 
rendered after Thursday. In most cases, Maxicare does not provide services 
directly but contracts with independent doctors, hospitals and pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Business as Usual' 
</P>
<P>
"It will be business as usual. We will continue to serve patients as long as 
Maxicare lives up to that statement," said Mitch Zevin, marketing director for 
Hawthorne Community Medical Center, which is the independent provider owed the 
most money by Maxicare. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, which serves 49,000 Maxicare members, interprets Maxicare's 
statement to mean that it will be paid for April services on April 10, Zevin 
said. "If we are not paid on April 10, we are going to have to make some 
decision. We can't continue indefinitely without being paid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By filing Thursday, Maxicare avoided having to pay many providers for services 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare officials declined to comment beyond a statement announcing the 
bankruptcy filings. 
</P>
<P>
"We acted in the face of increasing demands by creditors and our inability at 
this time to obtain additional financing," Ratican said in the statement. "By 
filing now, we believe Maxicare will be better able to protect its asset values 
and to maximize those values for all our constituencies: the health care 
providers, members, employers who offer our health plans as benefits, 
bondholders and other creditors, and our employees and stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare's stock, which traded as high as $28 a share in the company's boom 
years a decade ago, closed at 18.75 cents a share Thursday, down 50 cents from 
Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare's filing was not a surprise to analysts, regulators and industry 
officials who have followed the company since 1986, when it made what would 
prove to be two disastrous acquisitions. Fred J. Wasserman, the former chairman 
who helped establish Maxicare in 1973, intended to build a national firm that 
would attract large corporate clients looking for a single HMO for their 
scattered employees. 
</P>
<P>
HMOs charge patients a prepaid fee for medical services. By law, employers who 
provide medical insurance must offer a HMO as an option to employees if a HMO 
is available in the area. 
</P>
<P>
By acquiring HealthCare USA and HealthAmerica Corp. in 1986, Maxicare became 
the undisputed leader among for-profit HMOs, tripling its membership to 2 
million. But both acquired companies were in deep trouble. Over the next two 
years, Maxicare would have to cope with long-term debt that increased to nearly 
$500 million from the acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Interest payments on the debt, combined with medical cost increases that were 
going through the roof, created continuing losses for the company in 1987 and 
1988. Competitive pressures prevented Maxicare and many HMOs from raising 
premiums to cover increased costs. Wasserman left in a management shake-up last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1988, the company lost $250.5 million. Final 1988 
results have not been reported. 
</P>
<P>
Debt as of December included $150 million in bank loans and $295 million in 
bonds. In the company's bankruptcy filing, it listed assets of $498.8 million 
and liabilities of $535.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare made it a priority to pay past due debts to providers, but in recent 
weeks some providers have sued, said Margo Vignola, an analyst with Salomon 
Brothers in New York. "I think they just had to call a halt to it," she said.

THE BOMB ON FLIGHT 103: NEW CONTROVERSY ON ALERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Airline and regulatory officials on both sides of the Atlantic had much more 
warning than previously known about the threat of a bomb like the one that blew 
a Pan Am jumbo jet out of the skies over Scotland last December, it was 
revealed here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But whether through bad luck, as the regulators imply, or incompetence -- as 
charged by relatives of the victims -- no one put the disparate omens together 
until it was too late for all 259 persons aboard Flight 103 as well as 11 
residents of the small Scottish village where the fiery wreckage fell to earth. 
</P>
<P>
A bitter controversy over how much was known about the danger before the Pan Am 
bombing, and by whom, was renewed here Thursday thanks to what later turned out 
to be little more than a curious sidelight to the main developments. 
</P>
<P>
Local press reports revealed that two days before the Dec. 21 tragedy, the 
country's Transport Ministry had sent warnings and a photograph of an unusual 
type of bomb to U.S. and British airlines as well as South African Airways, 
Air-India and Israel's El Al. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, concealed inside a radio-cassette player, was the same type as is 
suspected of having brought down the Pan American World Airways Boeing 747. But 
because the warning was mailed, some recipients, including Pan Am, did not 
receive it until mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
While confirming the Dec. 19 advisory, however, Transport Minister Paul Channon 
dismissed it Thursday as "of no importance whatsoever," because virtually the 
same warning had been telexed to all British airlines on Nov. 22, nearly a 
month before Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that "in late 
October of 1988, West German authorities (in Frankfurt) arrested 14 suspected 
members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General 
Command. In November, we learned that among the evidence seized during those 
arrests was a bomb hidden in a Toshiba radio and which included a barometric 
pressure triggering device. (The detonator, which would trigger the bomb at a 
predetermined altitude, made it clear the bomb was meant to be smuggled on 
board an aircraft.) 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the unusual number of suspected PFLP -- GC members arrested and 
the discovery of such a bomb, the FAA issued, on Nov. 18, an Aviation Security 
Bulletin Number 88-19 to U.S. carriers to warn them about the presence of 
PFLP-GC members in Europe, the existence of this bomb, its characteristics, and 
to advise that increased security measures should be introduced to counter this 
threat. This bulletin remains in effect today." 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed that the company received the 
bulletin and said "appropriate action was taken." 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that the German discovery is linked to the Pan Am attack, 
but critics contend that combined with a second bit of intelligence, it should 
have triggered an alert which might have prevented the Lockerbie disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The second warning, previously disclosed, was telephoned anonymously to the 
U.S. Embassy in Helsinki last Dec. 5. The caller said radical Palestinians 
planned to smuggle a bomb onto a Pan Am flight originating in Frankfurt within 
the following two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt on a smaller plane before stopping in London 
to pick up additional passengers and change to the jumbo jet for the rest of 
its scheduled journey to New York. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA alerted American carriers and friendly governments to the Helsinki 
warning on Dec. 9, but the British authorities decided not to pass it on. 
American carriers serving London were already on a high state of alert, 
officials explained, and the anonymous call itself was given little 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Channon repeated Thursday his contention that the Helsinki alert was "probably 
a hoax" and has "no relevance whatsoever" to the Pan Am disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party opposition, meanwhile, mounted a strong attack on Channon and 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who defended her transport secretary. It may 
have been coincidence, opposition officials argued, but the various warnings 
described the threat to Pan Am Flight 103 very precisely. Yet the disaster was 
not prevented. Labor called for a special investigation to find out why. 
</P>
<P>
Channon rejected that idea. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Times of London reported today that police know the bomber's 
identity and present location. The Times said Channon will disclose details 
next week, but a spokeswoman for Channon said she knew of no plans for any 
announcement.

SMOKERS PAY COSTS OF HABIT, BUT DRINKERS DON'T, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to earlier research findings and the rhetoric of recent tobacco tax 
campaigns, smokers generally pay for the social costs of their habit, in part 
because some die before collecting pensions and Social Security, RAND Corp. 
researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
But drinkers cost others in society far more than they pay back in alcohol 
taxes. The researchers suggested that alcohol taxes should be at least doubled 
in order to cover the costs that drinking imposes on society. 
</P>
<P>
The costs of both drinking and smoking include higher health and disability 
insurance premiums, fires caused by smoking and innocent victims of drunk 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The RAND study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
attempts to examine the harm smokers and drinkers do to others, rather than to 
themselves. It then measures the cost of that damage against federal and state 
revenues based on current tobacco and alcohol tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that nonsmokers tend to subsidize through insurance 
premiums the medical care and life insurance payments of smokers. But smokers, 
because many die prematurely, end up having subsidized the pensions and 
nursing-home care of longer-lived nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
The study "points out that smokers, in very crass economic terms, save society 
dollars by kicking the bucket early -- specifically, that as a group they 
receive less Social Security," said Kenneth Warner, senior scientific editor on 
the U.S. surgeon general's most recent report on smoking and an economist at 
the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not suggesting that anyone perceives smoking to be a good thing for 
that reason," he added. He said it simply recognizes "the reduced cost of 
taking care of people in their old age because there won't be as many of them 
around." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers estimated the "external costs" of smoking -- for example, 
medical costs covered by health insurance premiums and payroll deductions -- at 
15 cents per pack of cigarettes. That figure is well below the average tobacco 
sales and excise tax of 37 cents per pack, they said. 
</P>
<P>
When the researchers added to that equation the lives lost in fires started by 
cigarettes and the deaths of nonsmokers attributed to passive smoking, the 
external costs of cigarette smoking rose to 38 cents per pack. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers calculated the external costs of drinking -- for example, the 
damage done to others by drunk drivers -- at about 48 cents per ounce of 
alcohol consumed. That figure is more than twice the average state's total 
alcohol tax of 23 cents, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The present tax system is off," said Willard G. Manning, the economist who 
headed the study. " . . . You don't want to pay the costs of . . . alcohol 
abuse and therefore provide (users) implicitly with a signal that it is OK to 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between smoking and drinking is that in smoking, the primary 
victim is the smoker himself," added Manning, who now is at the University of 
Michigan. ". . . The real problem arises with drinking because of innocent 
bystanders (killed) by drunken drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Word of the study prompted interest this week in Washington and Sacramento, 
where the idea of hiking "sin taxes" has recently resurfaced as a way of 
bringing in revenue and of discouraging teen-agers from smoking and drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento), who is contemplating a possible 
1990 ballot initiative to raise the state alcohol tax rate, said the RAND 
findings will be especially useful because of what he called the Santa Monica 
think tank's prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this study will add ammunition to the efforts of those who are 
advocating higher taxes," said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group 
lobbying to raise the federal alcohol tax. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute also welcomed the findings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see that someone . . . recognizes that smokers do in fact pay 
their way," said Brennan Dawson, assistant to the president of the trade group. 
She said the industry has long argued that "there is no cost to society." 
</P>
<P>
The RAND study is not the first to examine the social costs of smoking and 
drinking. But, rather than measuring overall costs, it differentiates between 
costs borne by people who smoke or drink and those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
That distinction is important to rational tax policy: Taxes should not 
subsidize activities a society does not wish to promote, Manning said. 
Cigarette and alcohol tax revenues should at least cover the external costs of 
smoking and drinking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Manning emphasized that he was not arguing that current tobacco tax rates are 
appropriate simply because they appear to cover social costs. He and other 
experts said it is also reasonable to increase taxes simply to raise revenue or 
deter bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of reasons for considering higher taxation of both alcohol and 
tobacco," Warner said. "Only one of those is to cover what the economists call 
social costs." 
</P>
<P>
The RAND study's estimates of the costs of smoking and drinking are lower than 
those in some other recent studies. For example, the federal Office of 
Technology Assessment concluded in 1985 that the social cost of a pack of 
cigarettes is $2.17. 
</P>
<P>
However, that figure represented costs to both smokers and nonsmokers. Manning 
said his group was "pretty conservative" in the economic assumptions used in 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol and tobacco taxes, originally intended to raise revenue in wartime, are 
made up of both federal and state taxes. Until the tobacco tax initiative 
passed last November, California's tax was among the lowest in the country. It 
is now nearly the highest. 
</P>
<P>
The state's alcohol tax rates are still among the lowest. For example, the tax 
on wine is 1 or 2 cents per gallon, depending on the alcohol content. The 
national average is 82 cents and the highest is $3, in Florida, according to 
the state Assembly Office of Research.

REAGAN OKD CONTRA ARMS DURING BAN, DOCUMENTS SAY 
</P>

According to an aide's notation, former President Ronald Reagan approved a 
shipment of U.S. arms to Nicaragua's Contras in late 1985 -- despite a 
congressional ban on such U.S. military assistance -- documents introduced at 
the trial of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North showed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A memo written on Oct. 3, 1985, by North and approved by his immediate 
superior, John M. Poindexter, with Poindexter's notation "President approved," 
reported on Contra activities and said in part: 
</P>
<P>
"You should also tell the President that we intend to air drop intelligence 
along with two recoilless rifles that should be able to sink one or both the 
arms carriers." 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. McFarlane, White House national security adviser at the time who has 
spent the last five days on the witness stand, testified that the rifles 
amounted to small artillery that could help Contra forces destroy or intercept 
ships that were carrying arms on a regular basis to troops of the leftist 
Sandinista government. But it was not disclosed whether the air-drop of arms 
and intelligence reports ever was completed. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane testified that the White House believed that Reagan was not bound by 
the congressional ban, authored by former Rep. Edward P. Boland (D-Mass.), in 
conducting foreign affairs. But North's memo suggested involvement in the 
air-drop by others who clearly would have been bound, including the CIA and 
U.S. military authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, who handled the memo, was McFarlane's chief deputy at the time. He 
later succeeded McFarlane in December, 1985, and was indicted last March, along 
with North and two others in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in another courtroom Thursday, Chief U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. 
Robinson Jr. said that Poindexter's separate trial will begin this fall after 
the conclusion of proceedings against North. 
</P>
<P>
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's attorney, brought out the involvement by the 
former President to support his contention that the Reagan White House had 
pursued a policy of secret assistance to the Contras, with covert support from 
U.S. allies, to compensate for a cutoff in aid by Congress in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan has contended that North, in line with this policy, acted on orders of 
his superiors to conceal his pro-Contra activities from Congress. The retired 
Marine officer is principally being tried on charges that he made false 
statements to Congress in 1985 and 1986 and obstructed congressional inquiries 
concerning his work for the National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan elicited testimony a day earlier from McFarlane that Reagan also had 
assisted the Nicaraguan guerrilla forces in 1985 by telephoning the president 
of Honduras to facilitate a shipment of ammunition to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan also asked McFarlane about a 1985 memo in which North reported that he 
planned to meet with retired Army Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub to discuss 
Singlaub's plan to obtain funds from Taiwan and South Korea to help equip the 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane said that he instructed North to have Singlaub operate "on his own" 
without the endorsement of the White House or the National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it clear," interjected U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, "that you 
didn't want any disclosure that you had authorized North to assist in getting 
arms and ammunition to the Contras?" 
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly clear I did not want him raising money," McFarlane said. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane -- during another round of questioning by John W. Keker, the chief 
prosecutor -- acknowledged that members of Reagan's National Security Council 
sought to keep secret the solicitation of Contra aid from other nations so that 
high government officials could deny the effort if they were ever questioned by 
Congress about it.

The European Commission on Thursday proposed to extend for an unlimited period 
its five-year-old ban on imports of seal pup skins. The commission, the 
executive body of the 12-member European Community, said its decision was based 
on the Norwegian government's announced intention to resume seal pup hunting as 
soon as the ban expires.

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union said Thursday that it has resumed flying weapons to 
Afghanistan because of a guerrilla offensive around Jalalabad, the first major 
battle since Soviet troops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov said the airlift resumed Wednesday, a month 
after the Soviet army left the Kabul government to fight the insurgents on its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
He said the weapons flown to Afghanistan included medium-range Scud-B missiles, 
which are said to have been fired from Kabul at guerrilla positions around 
Jalalabad, 75 miles to the east and 40 miles from the Pakistan border. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said at least 40 Ilyushin 76 transport planes have landed at the Kabul 
airport since Wednesday with military supplies and food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas Report Gains 
</P>
<P>
Muslim guerrillas said Thursday they have shot down two more aircraft in heavy 
fighting for Jalalabad, which they hope to capture as the seat of their interim 
government. The government said 470 insurgents were killed in the previous 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas also said Thursday that they have breached the airport perimeter 
in Jalalabad after a 10-day offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla officials said about 100 rebels cut through a barbed-wire fence at 
dusk Wednesday and seized a government post inside, killing six militiamen and 
capturing two tanks and two other military vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"The moujahedeen (guerrillas) are now inside the airport," a guerrilla 
spokesman said in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar. The report, 
received by radio from the Jalalabad area, could not be independently 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Pakistani Troops Sent 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov, who is also a deputy foreign minister, accused Pakistan of sending 
hundreds of its own soldiers along with the guerrillas in the intense battle 
for Jalalabad. 
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed the situation with the Pakistanis and they know what our 
reaction will be if their involvement continues," he said at a news conference 
at the Soviet Embassy. "We are not threatening the Pakistanis, but they must 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, along with the United States, supports the guerrillas but denies that 
any of its soldiers are fighting in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry 
called Vorontsov's allegation "fictitious." 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov called for immediate action by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar to set up all-party talks to end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"We see an intensification of the war in Afghanistan," he said. "We see a new 
aspect in the presence of Pakistani forces. We do not conceal from you that it 
looks like the beginning of a Pakistan-Afghanistan war." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denounces U.S. Role 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, speaking fluent English, also denounced the role of the United 
States in arming and aiding the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"The latest statements from the new administration in Washington that it would 
go on arming the moujahedeen means they want to continue the war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov warned that the Afghan conflict could affect the progress of detente 
with the United States. "It is going to be a very serious matter if the 
situation in this part of the world inflames into a regional crisis," he said, 
adding that the Soviet Union wants to discuss the whole problem with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He said the war could be stopped easily and quickly by a cease-fire, an end to 
"direct Pakistani military involvement which amounts to aggression" and the 
halting of weapons supplies to all sides. 
</P>
<P>
"There is the necessity for the active work of the U.N. secretary general to 
help all forces in Afghanistan to sit down at the negotiating table with a view 
to working out a broad-based government," he said.

FAR-RIGHT PARTY FAVORED IN SALVADORAN ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A political party with a history of anti-Americanism and a reputation for 
homicide is the likely winner of El Salvador's presidential election Sunday, 
marking a critical turn in the fortunes of a country tortured by civil war and 
economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
The Nationalist Republican Alliance -- or Arena party, as it is locally called 
after the first letters of its name in Spanish -- is leading its closest rival, 
the ruling Christian Democratic Party, by a margin of more than 2 to 1 in the 
latest opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
If the projections hold up -- and all signs indicate that the Christian 
Democratic candidate, Fidel Chavez Mena, is continuing to lose ground -- the 
ultra-rightist Arena, headed by Alfredo Cristiani, will win a plurality Sunday 
and be the odds-on favorite to win again in next month's probable runoff 
election. 
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted by the University of Central America here gave Arena 26.2% of 
the vote, the Christian Democrats 12.9% and the Democratic Convergence, a 
coalition of socialist and other leftist organization aligned with the rebel 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, 4.2% 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than 21% of the voters polled said they were still undecided, and 
20.3% said their preference was nobody's business but theirs. Chavez Mena was 
even outstripped by the 13.2% who said they would vote for none of the 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The big loser is Chavez Mena, 48, a lawyer and party technocrat whose 
popularity declined from 18% in a survey taken last month. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the vote of the uncommitted and the 'won't-says,' Cristiani, the 
Arena candidate, could win on the first round with more than the 51% needed to 
avoid a runoff. But most experts say this is not likely. 
</P>
<P>
A factor favoring Arena is the guerrillas' announced threat to kill election 
workers and to attack buses and other vehicles taking people to polling places. 
</P>
<P>
With the balloting still three days away, the guerrillas on Thursday paralyzed 
bus services, sabotaged power lines and staged sporadic attacks in a stepped-up 
drive to disrupt the election. 
</P>
<P>
News agencies reported that most bus drivers refused to work because rebels 
have warned bus companies to keep their vehicles off the streets and told gas 
stations to stay closed. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the capital and the eastern half of the country were without 
electricity after rebels destroyed power poles. Schools were closed throughout 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Arena has a solid membership base of about 500,000 voters who are considered 
more committed and better organized than the members of other parties and more 
likely to defy the transport ban. 
</P>
<P>
A Cristiani victory would give Arena nearly complete control of government at 
the national, provincial and local levels. The party already controls the 
National Assembly, the Supreme Court and a majority of the provincial and 
municipal governments. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani, 42 and a graduate of Georgetown University in Washington, is a 
millionaire coffee grower with a reputation for moderation in a party founded 
by a man -- former army Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson -- accused by the Salvadoran 
government and the United States of running death squads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Moderating Role 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani's quick rise in the party is attributed to the conviction of Arena 
leaders that D'Aubuisson, who ran for president in 1982 and 1984, would never 
be accepted by the rest of the country or by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For diplomats and local political experts, the real question posed by the 
election is not whether Cristiani will win but whether he can moderate the 
behavior of the hard-line party elements headed by D'Aubuisson, who is barred 
from entering the United States because of alleged human rights violations, 
including a charge of plotting to assassinate a U.S. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials say they would view an Arena victory with caution, given 
the party's past, but they also express confidence that Cristiani and other 
newcomers to the party leadership represent a modern, more flexible approach 
that has abandoned the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, one U.S. diplomat said, "this is an election in a democracy and 
we have to accept the results." 
</P>
<P>
This was not always the American attitude. In 1982, most observers think, Arena 
won the presidency but was deprived of the victory by the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the so-called new breed, Armando Calderon Sol, the mayor of San 
Salvador, recently told the Associated Press that "Washington turned El 
Salvador into a sociological laboratory" of anti-capitalism and that "we intend 
to rescue our sovereignty and independence." 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani has emphasized that further U.S. efforts to use its huge aid program 
-- $438 million a year at present -- to pressure the government to change its 
economic and military policies will be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Fears that Cristiani is either the good face of an essentially unchanged party 
or is not really any different from the D'Aubuisson forces have been reinforced 
by the candidate's refusal to condemn the past practices of the party's 
founders, including sponsorship of death squads that in the early 1980s killed 
hundreds of opponents and suspected guerrilla sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has he condemned such recent incidents as the killing of a Christian 
Democratic campaign worker by the Arena mayor of the suburb of Soyapango. Nor 
has he spoken out in the face of charges and evidence that death squads have 
been started up again by Arena elements associated with D'Aubuisson. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cristiani is considered personally free of any human rights taint. He is 
known for honesty and energy, qualities that have helped him in a campaign in 
which the Christian Democrats have been called corrupt and inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
The largest question mark about an Arena government is the nine-year-old civil 
war. D'Aubuisson and his associates have bitterly criticized the government and 
the United States for allegedly not trying to win the war. They argue that 
there is too much concern for human rights and too much concern for people in 
rural areas -- and that this has reduced the army's ability to kill guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
However, some experts say, Arena is in the best position to negotiate with the 
Marxist guerrillas. A European diplomat said, "Arena can make arrangements and 
concessions with the (guerrillas) that the Christian Democrats would be called 
traitors for doing."

RIGHT IN STEP WITH LEADER, LIGACHEV SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative in the Kremlin's leadership, said 
Thursday that he fully agrees with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the need 
for fundamental political and economic reforms despite speculation for more 
than a year of a deep rift between them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are efforts to set Ligachev against Gorbachev and against other people 
as well," Ligachev declared. "But the position of Ligachev totally and fully 
coincides with that of Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev made his remarks at an unusual press conference, his first with 
foreign journalists, after the close of a two-day party Central Committee 
meeting on agricultural reforms. He arrived from the daylong meeting appearing 
dour, but at the end of the two-hour session he was smiling and joking. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, Vadim A. Medvedev, who succeeded Ligachev last 
autumn in the key post of the party secretary in charge of ideology, announced 
that the Central Committee has appointed a special commission to look into the 
behavior of Boris N. Yeltsin, a former alternate member of the Politburo who 
has clashed with both Gorbachev and Ligachev in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who many observers believe will win election to the new Congress of 
People's Deputies, was removed from the Politburo early last year after 
complaining that Ligachev behaved dictatorially and that Gorbachev's reforms 
were proceeding too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Gorbachev and Ligachev, who had stood second in the 
ruling Politburo until last autumn when he was shifted from being the party 
secretary in charge of ideological issues to party secretary for agricultural 
policy, has been widely discussed in political circles here; Ligachev is often 
viewed as the voice of caution and conservatism as Gorbachev has tried to 
broaden and accelerate his reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ligachev the Defender 
</P>
<P>
He and Gorbachev have appeared to differ most recently over the agricultural 
reforms, with Gorbachev advocating the leasing of farmland, equipment and other 
assets to small groups of farmers and even individuals in an effort to expand 
agricultural production and Ligachev defending the 60-year-old system of state 
and collective farms although they are unable to feed the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he and Gorbachev had diverged significantly in their public statements 
on the scope and speed of the whole program of political, economic and social 
reforms, on the ideological basis for Soviet foreign policy and on the way that 
the Communist Party leads the country. 
</P>
<P>
But at Thursday's press conference, Ligachev wagged a finger at questioning 
journalists and said: "Please understand me. We have full unity on all basic 
questions, not only in agriculture but on other matters of principle as well." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, he added, "carries out his duties splendidly" and has the 
Politburo's full support. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they call Ligachev a conservative, sometimes even a reactionary," 
Ligachev said. "But this arises from misunderstanding of the matter, or 
sometimes also out of a desire to see a divided Soviet leadership. Ligachev's 
positions are fully in line with the Politburo's positions." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev expressed confidence that the new agrarian policies will resolve the 
country's acute food shortage by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Ligachev's unusual remarks on the much-debated issue of his 
relationship with Gorbachev, Radio Moscow gave more prominence in its late 
evening news report to the appointment of the special party commission on 
Yeltsin, even though the report on Yeltsin will not be ready until well after 
the March 26 election. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, appointed on the complaint of a Central Committee member from a 
Moscow electrical engineering plant, is to review the former Moscow party 
chief's statements to see whether he had broken with party policy and whether 
he should be further disciplined.

BUSH DEFENDS PACE OF HIS 'LONG-TERM' AGENDA 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, countering criticism that he has yet to define specific goals 
or introduce legislative initiatives, asked a hometown audience here Thursday 
to be patient with the public pace of his Administration's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"In this kind of work, more is going on than meets the eye -- or makes the 
headlines," he said. "This is an American agenda for the long term. We aren't 
going to clean up the environment, turn our education system around or create a 
more responsive business climate in one single day. But if we begin today to 
make steady progress, we will succeed." 
</P>
<P>
But even as the President sought to draw attention to the long term, he 
returned to what so far has been the most immediate item on his agenda: the 
long effort to fill the vacant post of defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complains Again About Tower 
</P>
<P>
On the day when the Senate Armed Services Committee approved the nomination of 
Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.) to head the Pentagon, Bush once again complained 
about the treatment given to his initial choice for the post, former Sen. John 
Tower (R-Tex.). Tower's nomination was rejected by the Senate last Thursday 
after a drawn-out battle over his drinking, relations with women and potential 
conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking quietly but emphatically during a question-and-answer session at the 
end of a luncheon speech, Bush said: "I think there are intrusions into 
people's private lives that go beyond the public trust or go beyond one's 
ability to serve and I don't like the excesses. 
</P>
<P>
"People say to me: 'Didn't it drag your Administration down, to stand with Sen. 
Tower?' The answer is, no . . . . The answer is, I wasn't able to move away 
from Sen. Tower," Bush said. "People are entitled to fair play. They are 
entitled to have the rumor laid aside and people to make up decisions based on 
fact not perception, and so whether it damages me five percentage points or 10 
doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Bush White House has yet to determine by public opinion poll 
whether the fight over Tower has damaged the President's popularity. Robert 
Teeter, who supervised polling for Bush during the presidential campaign, said 
Wednesday that no opinion survey has been conducted for the White House since 
Bush took office on Jan. 20 -- a gap that would have been unheard of in the 
Ronald Reagan White House. 
</P>
<P>
As he approaches the end of his second month in office, Bush, who pledged to 
"hit the ground running," has taken increasingly to defending the relatively 
slow pace of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism from Republicans, among others, the President and his 
aides have argued that the presidential term runs four years and that, in a 
time of budgetary constraints, they must weigh options carefully and restrict 
themselves to top priority items before moving forward publicly. 
</P>
<P>
And, indeed, the President argued Thursday at the start of his speech: "I've 
come to Texas to tell you we're hard at work in Washington -- and we're making 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risks to Strategy 
</P>
<P>
But in defending himself at length -- as he did in Texas and as he did during a 
nationally televised news conference two weeks ago -- Bush risks crossing a 
narrow line: He draws attention to the criticism and thus risks cementing it in 
the public consciousness, without necessarily convincing his audiences that his 
Administration is moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign policy, he has put off any major steps pending a "global" review. 
And he introduced his first major domestic initiative -- a child care tax 
credit for low-income parents -- Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, he has kept up a busy travel schedule to make contact with audiences 
around the country and lay out the broad themes on what he referred to Thursday 
as an agenda "to get ready for a new century." As of Thursday, the 55th day of 
his presidency, he had spent all or part of 15 days on the road -- maintaining 
the peripatetic pace of his vice presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Forum Club, an independent, nonpartisan group established 11 
years ago to present speakers to Houston audiences, Bush defended his 
reluctance to date to tackle foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
In the four months since Bush was elected President, Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev has captured worldwide attention with a plan, made public at the 
United Nations, to make sharp reductions in Soviet military forces and to trim 
the number of Soviet troops stationed in Eastern Europe -- and Bush has yet to 
illuminate the path he will follow in U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites 'Prudent Review' 
</P>
<P>
"Some are saying: 'You'd better hurry up. You don't want Mr. Gorbachev to 
capture the high ground with his speech at the United Nations. Don't want him 
to mold public opinion further in Europe,' " he said. But, Bush declared, "far 
more important is that we do a prudent review of our foreign policy, national 
security requirements and then in concert with our allies move forward." 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to lead the (North Atlantic Treaty) alliance. The United 
States has in the past. But I am not going to be pushed into speedy action 
because Mr. Gorbachev gives a compelling speech at the United Nations and I 
hope the Soviets understand that," the President said, echoing an approach he 
enunciated at the news conference two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Bush flew to Colorado Springs, Colo., where he delivered a 
dinner speech on education.

Seven antelope were killed Thursday by a pack of dogs that got into their 
compound at the St. Louis Zoo, authorities said. When security guards 
discovered the attack on the herd of eight South African springbok antelope, 
they shot one of the dogs to death in the compound. Three other dogs were 
chased from the area and later killed.

LEBANESE TERRORIST YOUNIS UNREPENTANT ABOUT HIJACKING, SAYS HE'D DO IT AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dressed in a pink oxford cloth shirt and a blue-and-pink paisley tie, Fawaz 
Younis appeared ever the polite prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling, he thanked the federal marshal for pulling out a chair for him. The 
steel manacles, inserted through the belt loops of his trousers and linked to 
handcuffs, kept his wrists pulled tightly to his waist. Even simple movements 
were awkward. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, 24 hours after he had become the first foreign terrorist found guilty of 
air piracy and hostage-taking under new laws allowing the United States to hunt 
down suspects overseas, Younis was also unrepentant for the 1985 hijacking of 
Royal Jordanian Flight 402. If ordered by the militia, he said, he would do it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son of Beirut Policeman 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a terrorist and my actions were not dependent on any terrorism," 
insisted Younis, a former used-car salesman and son of a Beirut policeman. "Our 
actions did not include harming civilians in any way. Terrorist acts, on the 
other hand, harm civilians." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 70 passengers and crew members were aboard Flight 402, which was 
hijacked in Beirut and flown to Cyprus, Tunisia and Italy. And some of the 
hijackers beat the Jordanian military sky marshals, although the jury found 
that Younis was not involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped that the United States government would really track down the true 
terrorists and bring them to justice and make an example of them," Younis said 
in an apparent reference to such groups as Hezbollah, the umbrella group whose 
cells hold most of the nine American hostages in Beirut. "My arrest will not 
affect terrorist acts one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Now facing a sentence of up to life imprisonment, Younis seemed almost at peace 
with himself during the first interview since his conviction. Often smiling and 
occasionally laughing, he was incredulous rather than angry. U.S. authorities, 
he claims, got the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no grudge against the U.S. government," he said in pointed reference to 
other Middle East hijackings and terrorist attacks aimed at American targets. 
"If I had a problem with the American government, I would have harmed the (two) 
Americans on board. Our problem is with Arabs." 
</P>
<P>
Younis was ordered to seize the plane and fly it to Tunis, where the Arab 
League was meeting, to demand that all Palestinians be removed from Lebanon. 
Shiite militiamen and Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas returning to 
Lebanon were, at the time, engaged in fierce battles. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry to say that I have been imprisoned because the American government 
would like to show off," he said without any trace of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
As Younis sees it, his problem stems from the lack of understanding in the 
United States about the context of Lebanese violence. His court-appointed 
defense lawyer described him as "an ordinary man caught in extraordinary 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
For much of the interview, Younis reflected candidly on how his life led, 
almost naturally, to the 1985 hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
Born 30 years ago in the Lebanese city of Baalbeck, famous for ruins of the 
colossal Temple of Jupiter, which was begun under Julius Caesar and finished by 
Augustus, Younis' family moved to the Shiite slums of Beirut when he was still 
a baby. At the time, tens of thousands migrated to the capital for better jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Younis grew up in the tense environment when both Sunni and Shiite Muslims 
began mobilizing to demand a greater role in the Christian-dominated 
government. He was 15 when the Lebanese civil war erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1975, when the war started, we did not quite understand the reasons but we 
saw the adults carrying guns and walking tall," he said. "We wanted to be like 
them, to emulate them." 
</P>
<P>
Younis completed two years of high school, more than any other family member. 
In 1979, he joined Amal, the new Shiite political and military faction, as did 
the majority of his peers. Amal was originally called the Movement of the 
Oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to be more aware," he said. "I was deprived of my rights as a 
Lebanese citizen. I was oppressed by the government as well as Lebanon's 
enemies. That is why I became a soldier, so that I could help those like me who 
were oppressed and weak. I started to look for a way out of this deprivation." 
</P>
<P>
The first time he fired a gun, he used it against a local Communist militia. 
The first weapon he fired was an M-16, the standard U.S. Army automatic rifle. 
His expressive brown eyes twinkled and he started to laugh as he thought of the 
irony. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had ever killed anyone, he replied: "In war, you just shoot. You 
don't see if you kill anyone." With some indignation, he added: "I'm not a 
sniper." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he fought in the blocks where he lived. At other times, he operated 
along the Green Line that divides Muslim-dominated West Beirut from the 
Christian-led east side of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when he had last spent a normal day, he said: "The normal day as you see 
it in America is something that we do not have in our country. The best we can 
hope for is a day when there is a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe my kids will ever spend a day without being scared and, even 
if that happens, then they will dream of it." Younis has two sons, aged 2 and 
5, named after his two brothers killed in Beirut clashes, one fighting 
Christians, the other, Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1983, Younis also worked as a used-car dealer to support his family. 
Asked if he had ever flown before the hijacking, he rattled off the countries 
he had visited: Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, Sweden, Poland, 
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. He said that he visited Poland 19 
times. He and his colleagues sometimes drove back from Europe in the used cars 
they bought. 
</P>
<P>
When Lebanon's economy began to collapse in 1983, Younis gave up his business. 
"Once the U.S. dollar became expensive, we could not buy cars any more," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
When Amal took control of West Beirut in early 1984, he became a full-time Amal 
military officer, for which he was paid, for a time. His rank was the 
equivalent of a lieutenant in charge of a platoon of men. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen months later, he was summoned by Amal's military commander and ordered 
to hijack the Jordanian plane. 
</P>
<P>
"My action was legal and legitimate because I am a soldier," he maintained. "I 
received an order and I carried it out. It was my duty to fulfill." 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Younis painted a grim portrait of what happened when orders 
were refused. He once saw an Amal member shot through both legs for refusing to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
A marshal described Younis' behavior in prison as "docile, even gentle." During 
the trial, he was nicknamed "the teddy-bear terrorist" by members of the 
gallery because of his demeanor and because the 30-hour hijacking was among the 
briefest and least bloody acts of Middle East sky piracy. 
</P>
<P>
Since his capture in international waters off Cyprus 18 months ago, Younis has 
been held in solitary confinement in a New York prison. Its identity has not 
been disclosed for fear of rescue attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Younis, who has grown back the full beard that he had shaved before his trial, 
spends most of his time reading the Koran -- 54 times so far by his count. He 
had never read it before. Besides the five daily prayers of a devout Muslim, he 
has said others to make up "for prayers I missed during the war." 
</P>
<P>
Religion has provided him with comfort, he said. "There is a Koranic verse that 
says those who fear God, God will make things easy for them," he said. "Now I 
believe in Islam on the basis of knowledge, not just because I was born a 
Muslim." 
</P>
<P>
The red prayer mark of devout Muslims, who pray with their heads bent over and 
touching the floor, looks almost permanent on his forehead. He complains about 
the prison guard who imitates his praying by mumbling nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
Younis was not allowed to call his wife for more than a year after his capture. 
He has lost 40 pounds, he said with a laugh, because of "the luxury life here." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that he envied his two dead brothers, whom he called "shahids," or 
martyrs. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is nothing, basically, it's like a cloud passing by," Younis said. "It's 
the afterlife that counts. I'm praying to my God for this."

JOHN P. SCRIPPS; NEWSPAPER FAMILY SCION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John P. Scripps, scion of the veteran newspaper family who as a youth added to 
the Scripps Howard empire by investing in a small newspaper that grew to a 
chain, has died. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps, who was also a noted yachtsman and a breeder and owner of race horses, 
died Wednesday night of heart failure at the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, the 
company announced Thursday. He was 76, had been ill for three weeks and was 
recovering from pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps added a major chapter to the 200-year family newspaper history when he 
invested at age 16 in a newspaper that became the foundation of a group of 
papers in California and Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the chain comprises seven daily newspapers and a half interest in an 
eighth with a combined circulation of more than 200,000. It also owns two 
weekly papers. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Cleveland, Scripps was orphaned at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
He was raised under the influence of his two grandfathers, E. W. Scripps 
(1851-1926) and Col. Milton A. McRae (1858-1930), founder and general manager, 
respectively, of the Scripps McRae League. 
</P>
<P>
In 1928, with help from McRae, the teen-age Scripps invested funds from his 
inheritance in a struggling California daily, the Ventura County Star. Two 
years later, when McRae died, Scripps left USC, where he was studying for a 
journalism degree, to take over full-time management of his small company. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, now called the Ventura County Star-Free Press, is the organization's 
flagship publication with a daily circulation of about 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, together with his cousins Charles, Ted, and Robert Scripps, he 
spearheaded a merger of the John P. Scripps Newspapers division with Scripps 
Howard, the media firm founded by his paternal grandfather in 1888. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps remained active in the company until his death, serving as chairman of 
the board of John P. Scripps Newspapers and as a director of Scripps Howard. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by two sons, two daughters, four grandchildren and one 
great-grandchild.

MARGUERITE ROBERTS; WRITER BLACKBALLED IN 1950S RED HUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marguerite Roberts, who was forced to abandon a promising screenwriting career 
when she refused to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee 
in 1951, yet returned to films to write the screen treatment of "True Grit," 
has died. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Jarrico, a friend and fellow scenarist, said she had died Feb. 17 in Santa 
Barbara where she and her husband, novelist John Sanford, had moved after the 
Red hunt that plagued the film industry. She was 84 and died of 
atherosclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Roberts, whose refusal to testify cost her the screen credit for 
"Ivanhoe," took the Fifth Amendment when she appeared before the House 
committee in September, 1951. According to the book "The Inquisition in 
Hollywood," she was beseeched by her employer, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to 
cooperate, but when she refused, her contract was terminated. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Roberts, who had written such films as "Dragon Seed," "Ziegfeld Girl" and 
"Sea of Grass," had told the committee that she was not a Communist but refused 
to testify further, citing her constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrico said that after nine years on the blacklist, she was hired by Columbia 
to write "Diamond Head." Her later pictures included "Love Has Many Faces," "5 
Card Stud" and "Red Sky at Morning," in addition to the 1969 adaptation of the 
novel on which "True Grit" was based. The film won John Wayne his only Academy 
Award.

<P>
Her husband survives, as does a sister.

The government of Laos has agreed to go forward with a joint search for missing

U.S. report that listed Laos and Burma as major drug sources, the State 
Department said Thursday. 
</P>

Spokesman Charles Redman said the U.S.-Laotian mission, which had been set for 
March 4, will take place shortly, with a team of American experts due to arrive

for 547 American servicemen still listed as missing in Laos from the Vietnam 
War.

DRIZZLES EXPECTED TO DRY UP, GIVING WAY TO WARM WEEKEND IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Possible overnight drizzles should be gone from Southern California by this 
morning, the forecasters say, giving way to wind and to warmer weather that 
should be even better by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Today's west-to-northwest winds, expected to gust to about 20 m.p.h., "ought to 
die down" tonight and should not be too much of a problem after that, said 
meteorolgist Pat Cooper of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
With a large low-pressure system to the north continuing to move inland and a 
high-pressure ridge building up off Baja California, temperatures are expected 
to rise from today's cloudy mid-60s to low 70s on Saturday and slightly warmer 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The cold front that brushed the Southland on Thursday brought winds whipping up 
to more than 30 m.p.h. in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Stiff winds also hit the deserts of San Diego County and Kern County. Motorists 
with high-profile vehicles were warned to be careful driving in the Mojave 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said Thursday's high temperature at Civic Center 
was 62 degrees. The low was 55. Relative humidity ranged from 96% to 62%. 
</P>
<P>
The storm front dumped heavy rain on Northern California, snow and strong winds 
in the Sierra Nevada and high winds in Nevada.

The Roman Catholic Church has canceled its traditional Palm Sunday procession 
in Jerusalem for the second straight year due to the Palestinian uprising 
against Israeli occupation, a church official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The march, due to be held next Sunday, from the Mount of Olives to the Church 
of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem's walled Old City, was a highlight of the 
Christian calendar in the Holy Land and attracted thousands of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Father Adib Zoomot, secretary to the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Archbishop 
Michel Sabbah, said church leaders decided to call off the parade "out of 
concern for worshipers in these troubled times."

About 100 students at Colby-Sawyer College staged a sit-in Thursday at the 
administration building, singing "I Am Woman," to protest the possible 
admission of men. The protest ended after students met with two administrators 
to discuss a possible delay in the scheduled April 1 trustees' vote on 
admitting men.

MILKY WHITE SUBSTANCE: IS IT A SOLUTION? 
</P>

<P>
Unless Dr. Jamie Astaphan comes forward with a diary of his own, the mystery of 
Ben Johnson's positive drug test for the anabolic steroid, stanozolol, in the 
1988 Olympic Games might never be solved. 
</P>
<P>
But the most plausible explanation to date emerged Thursday when sprinter 
Angella Taylor Issajenko suggested that Astaphan gave her, Johnson and other 
Canadian athletes stanozolol under false pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
On her fourth and final day of testimony before the Canadian government's 
commission of inquiry into drug use by athletes, Issajenko said that Astaphan 
gave the athletes unmarked bottles of a milky white substance, which he 
identified as Estragol. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that she believes the substance could have been a veterinary 
preparation called Winstrol-V, the brand name for stanozolol. Winstrol-V also 
is milky white. 
</P>
<P>
That would explain Johnson's positive test for stanozolol after he had won the 
100 meters Sept. 24 in Seoul, 22 days after his last injection of the drug that 
he, according to testimony from Issajenko, referred to simply as "Astaphan's 
white stuff." 
</P>
<P>
That also explains the 20-second pause after Issajenko was asked Wednesday by 
the doctor's attorney, David Sookram, whether she trusted Astaphan, who had 
treated Johnson, Issajenko and other athletes coached by Charlie Francis from 
1984 through the 1988 Games. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving no response, Sookram changed the question to whether Issajenko 
liked Astaphan. 
</P>
<P>
"I do like him," she said. "I have no bad feelings against him." 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, under questioning by the commission's chairman, Ontario associate 
chief justice Charles L. Dubin, Issajenko said that she had doubts about the 
substance that Astaphan first gave her in 1986 because it had the same side 
effects as Winstrol, which she had used in the oral form for a brief time in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
After discussing it with two other Canadian athletes she said were using the 
drug, sprinter Desai Williams and hurdler Mark McKoy, she testified that they 
came to the conclusion that the substance "probably was Winstrol V. But nobody 
was sure." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney who represented Astaphan Thursday, Lorne Levine, was angry 
afterward, complaining that he had no advance warning of Issajenko's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it were possible that Astaphan had given the athletes Winstrol-V, he 
said: "I'm not about to comment on that. I think he'll testify that there was 
informed consent, that the patients were aware of what they were receiving." 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan, who lives on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, is scheduled to 
testify in May. 
</P>
<P>
Before announcing an adjournment until April 3, Dubin instructed the commission 
to draw no conclusions until all the testimony is heard. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that is increasingly clear, however, is that the drug Astaphan gave 
the athletes was not Estragol, a brand name that is not listed in any of the 
standard physicians' reference books. Issajenko said that Astaphan, once the 
inquiry was called, told her the drug in question was Miotolin, a brand name 
for the steroid furazabol. 
</P>
<P>
Issajenko, who kept the drugs that the athletes used at her Toronto home, said 
that she gave 12 bottles of the substance to the commission. Sources close to 
the commission told The Times that the substance was analyzed at a laboratory, 
but they would not reveal whether it contained stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
During Francis' testimony earlier this month, the commission's co-counsel, 
Robert P. Armstrong, repeatedly questioned him about the Estragol "or the 
substance you believed to be Estragol." 
</P>
<P>
But although Francis testified that Johnson had been using steroids and other 
performance enhancing drugs banned by the International Olympic Committee since 
1981, the coach said that it would have been obvious to him if the sprinter was 
on stanozolol before the Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the sprinter used the oral form of the drug, Winstrol, several 
times between 1982 and the spring of 1987 and invariably complained of 
soreness. He said that Johnson had no such complaints during his last cycle of 
drug use -- Aug 22-Sept. 2 -- before leaving for Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Francis presented a sabotage scenario, pointing a finger at an unidentified 
stranger in the doping control area after the race who, he said, could have 
spiked Johnson's drink with stanozolol. Issajenko said that Francis also cast 
suspicion on the Canadian track and field team's physical therapist, Waldemar 
Matuszewski, who could have rubbed stanozolol into Johnson's system during a 
massage. Although Issajenko said earlier this week she initially believed 
Matuszewski was a possible saboteur, she ultimately concluded that Astaphan and 
Johnson "cut it too close." 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony from both Francis and Issajenko, Astaphan usually 
instructed the athletes to stop using drugs at least 28 days before testing. 
There were only 22 days between Johnson's last injection of the so-called 
Estragol and the 100 meter final in Seoul.

MORNING BRIEFING: BASEBALL'S RICHEST: $19-MILLION LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most expensive lineup in baseball this season costs $19,494,874 and does 
not even include Jose Canseco, Kirby Puckett or Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press' all-money team does, however, list two Dodgers -- Orel 
Hershiser and Eddie Murray. Hershiser's 1989 salary, including a prorated share 
of his signing bonus, is $2,766,667, the highest in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
In the AP lineup, Hershiser would throw to Gary Carter of the New York Mets, 
who earns $2,160,714. The infield would have Murray at first base, $2,244,462; 
Juan Samuel of the Philadelphia Phillies at second, $1.45 million; Cal Ripken 
of the Baltimore Orioles at shortstop, $2,466,667, and George Brett of the 
Kansas City Royals at third, $1,803,979. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel played second base last season, but Philadelphia is planning on moving 
him to the outfield this year. If he weren't counted, Steve Sax of the New York 
Yankees would take over at second at $1,266,667. The most expensive outfield in 
baseball would have Jim Rice of the Boston Red Sox, $2,325,385; Andy Van Slyke 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates, $2.15 million, and Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs, 
$2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup has average batting statistics of .275 with 20 home runs and 79 runs 
batted in, not including the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The payroll of the all-money team increased 5.6% from last year's $18,469,222, 
and the players earn an average of $2.17 million. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: Which school holds the longest active streak in the nation for most 
consecutive postseason basketball tournament appearances? 
</P>
<P>
Greener greens: There is an increasingly acceptable living to be made by 
hitting a little white ball around a field. No fewer than 172 golfers earned 
$100,000 or more last year by playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
The figure includes 112 players on the PGA Tour, 32 on the PGA Seniors Tour and 
28 on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
The way he walks that walk: Willie Wilson of the Kansas City Royals walked only 
22 times last season and has never walked more than 39 times in a season. 
</P>
<P>
It comes as something of a surprise this spring, therefore, to hear Wilson say, 
"I know I need to walk a little more and to improve my on-base percentage (.289 
last year, lowest among all leadoff hitters in the American League). Last year, 
I was swinging at a lot of balls in the dirt, balls over my head, everything. 
That's going to stop. We want to win, and if takes my willingness to walk, I'll 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
All this from a man who once was quoted as saying, "If I wanted to walk, I 
would have become a mailman." 
</P>
<P>
That's Cincinnati, Bavaria: Not long ago, Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati 
Reds, was asked a question: 
</P>
<P>
After four consecutive second-place finishes, how long will she wait for the 
Reds to win the National League West? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm German," she replied, "so I'm not too patient." 
</P>
<P>
Not too accurate, either. The Reds' media guide says that Schott is "a native 
and sixth-generation resident of Cincinnati." 
</P>
<P>
Shuffling along in Buffalo: It's distinctly possible that the Pittsburgh 
Pirates' lineup on opening day will be an average of three years younger than 
their triple-A Buffalo club. 
</P>
<P>
The Bisons could have three starting pitchers over 30, and their lineup will 
include such veterans as Rennie Stennett, 38; Steve Henderson, 36; Tito 
Landrum, 34, and Reggie Williams, 28. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: St. John's, whose appearance in the National Invitation 
Tournament is its 25th straight in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Butler University basketball Coach Joe Sexson, after reading that he 
was going to be replaced: "I just saw this in the paper. It appears that I am 
going to resign this weekend."

TOURNAMENT PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP;

CLEARWATER LEADS PAR-BUSTERS AT SAWGRASS

<TEXT>
<P>
A course formerly maligned as a swamp area best suited to alligators, is now 
being praised by the touring golf pros. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? The Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, site of the Players 
Championship, was most accommodating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine players shot sub-par opening rounds on a warm, virtually windless 
day in the $1.35-million tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Clearwater led the pack with a 65, seven under par, saying that his round 
was "almost fun." Some of the joy left him, though, when he bogeyed the last 
two holes. 
</P>
<P>
After 16 holes, he was nine under par and seemingly on the verge of breaking 
the course record of 64 set by Fred Couples in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lietzke, Steve Pate and David Frost followed Clearwater with 66s, and Ben 
Crenshaw was at 67. 
</P>
<P>
Clearwater, 29, who grew up in Walnut Creek, Calif., and attended Brigham Young 
University, slipped to 127th on the money list last year after having won two 
tournaments and earning $320,007 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, my wife had a child, and we built a home," Clearwater said. "I got 
to thinking, with some success, that I was a family man and I was going to fly 
home every Sunday night after a tournament and fly back Wednesday to the next 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't change my general feeling, but I learned that a casual attitude 
toward being excellent at something just won't get it." 
</P>
<P>
So, Clearwater said he rededicated himself this year and, as a result, he holds 
a one-stroke lead over a prominent field. 
</P>
<P>
Clearwater, playing in the afternoon and starting on the 10th tee, had five 
birdies on his front side with putts ranging from six to 18 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Then he birdied four more holes, and the course record seemed likely to be his 
when he approached No. 8, a 215-yard par-three. 
</P>
<P>
But his tee shot went into a bunker, and after blasting out, he two-putted. He 
found another bunker on the par-five, 582-yard No. 9 and wound up with another 
bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Clearwater's staggering finish of a fine round was in distinct contrast to 
Curtis Strange's closing holes. Strange, last year's leading money-winner, 
rallied after a triple bogey on the par-four, 438-yard 14th hole. 
</P>
<P>
He was even par going into the last four holes but finished par, eagle, birdie, 
birdie for a 68, three strokes behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw said that at one time the course was "darn near unplayable." However, 
since modifications have been made, he has a different opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't plan a shot before," he said. "You didn't know what was going to 
happen to the ball. It was like shooting a marble and not knowing where it 
would end up. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's like a big buffer came down out of the sky to smooth out the sharp 
edges and make it playable." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia, this year's leading money-winner, might not agree. He had an 
opening round of 74, matching Greg Norman's score. 
</P>
<P>
Others, though, were more gratified, such as Lietzke. 
</P>
<P>
"The flags weren't moving," he said. "Wind is the only thing that dictates 
scores. Courses don't." 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke added: "There are 140 Lanny Wadkins' out here," referring to the bold 
golfer who is always shooting for the flag. "Nobody backs off. Nobody shies 
away from the pin, whether it's Thursday or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a time when you could be a leader by one or two strokes and 
you could go out and kind of protect that lead on Sunday. That doesn't happen 
anymore. The winners are still shooting 67 or 68 on Sundays, on hard golf 
courses." 
</P>
<P>
The Sawgrass layout obviously wasn't a difficult test for many pros Thursday. 
Weather, of course, had something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The course is absolutely in superb condition," said David Graham, who played 
in the morning and shot a 68. "I can't imagine the course being in better 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
Lietzke, who had seven birdies and only one bogey in his round of 66, had one 
minor complaint. He is using a new putter and said he was charging past the 
hole on the fast greens. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, the former UCLA star, found the greens to his liking. 
</P>
<P>
"The greens are perfect, the best I've ever seen," he said. "If you can't make 
putts, you have no excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Pate had six birdies in his round. Moreover, he said it was the first round he 
could remember that he hadn't missed the fairway with any of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
Said Frost, who played with Pate: "Steve and I both had our putters working 
today. That's going to be the stick this week because the greens are so good." 
</P>
<P>
The South African-born Frost had six birdies. He got one with a 30-foot chip 
shot on the par-four, 360-yard fourth hole and another with a 25-foot putt on 
the par-four, 454-yard fifth hole. 
</P>
<P>
The odds are against first-round leaders maintaining their edge throughout a 
tournament. Lietzke, 37, says that's because the tour is more competitive than 
it has been in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more guys capable of winning now," he said. "I've been out here 15 
years, and going back to when I first started, about 30 guys were capable of 
winning a golf tournament. As for this week, 80, 90 or 100 are capable of 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the players are any better than in the Nicklaus, Hogan or Nelson 
eras. But they had to beat about a dozen players for their titles, and the 
players today have to beat 70 or 80."

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: IT'S OPEN SEASON ON STEVE GARVEY, BUT HE HAS BEEN 
OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Garvey has always been a favorite of the electronic media. He's smooth 
and eloquent, comfortable in front of cameras and microphones, and is always 
accommodating. 
</P>
<P>
When he heard that Channel 39 in San Diego was breaking a story that two women 
were claiming he was responsible for their pregnancies and that he had married 
a third, he did what he thought was the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of saying, "No comment," he chose to meet the situation head on. He 
went down to the station and was interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
And he didn't duck subsequent interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
He was with Larry King on CNN last Monday, and he was on Channel 7's "AM Los 
Angeles" Tuesday. He also did a separate interview with Channel 7's Jim Hill. 
</P>
<P>
But he probably won't be doing any more interviews in the near future, said 
John Boggs, executive vice president of the Garvey Marketing Group in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"He has nothing more to say," Boggs said. "This is a very personal matter that 
has been made public only because Steve is who he is." 
</P>
<P>
You really can't blame Garvey for saying enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
He had a tough go-around on the Larry King show. Although it wasn't mentioned 
on the show, King has dated Garvey's former wife, Cyndy, which raises the 
question: Was he an objective interviewer? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the questions were fair, but several were not. 
</P>
<P>
King, to his credit, got right to the point, asking, "What is your overall 
reaction to the embarrassment of all this?" 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said it was an unfortunate situation, one that he was sorry about and 
also said it was unfortunate it had become public. 
</P>
<P>
King: "How do you assess damage? How has Steve Garvey been hurt? We know about 
the jokes and the radio station in San Diego that is putting out bumper 
stickers that read, 'I got to first base with Steve Garvey.' And, 'Honk if 
you're carrying Steve Garvey's baby.' . . . Aren't you embarrassed? How do you 
feel?" 
</P>
<P>
Garvey: "Of course I am embarrassed, obviously. Unfortunately, you sometimes 
get lumped with other situations that are happening now with people who were 
married when they had these problems. Again, I was single at the time. Again, 
there were miscommunications." 
</P>
<P>
He did admit to errors in judgment, and talked of how difficult it is for him 
to end relationships. "I just hate to hurt somebody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
King later asked Garvey if he thought he should seek counseling to help him in 
this area. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, this has been a good education," Garvey said. "I don't think I'll 
have to see someone after this." 
</P>
<P>
King hit pretty hard when he asked: "What do you say, or have you explained 
this to your two daughters (from his marriage to Cyndy)?" 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said: "They are the two people I'm most sorry to and feel for the most. 
I have tried to explain my feelings to them and that their father will do what 
is right. And again I have to tell them their dad is fallible. Again, over the 
years people have said you're the all-American boy, squeaky clean. No, I say I 
just try hard. . . . I do strike out sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
King: "Did they understand?" 
</P>
<P>
Garvey: "They're still relatively young, but as time goes by and they have 
relationships of their own, I hope they will understand." 
</P>
<P>
Only once did Garvey decline to comment, when King asked if an upcoming book by 
Cyndy was a concern. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, King, after establishing that Garvey is Catholic, asked: "So do you 
feel like a sinner?" 
</P>
<P>
Garvey: "Again, we do make mistakes, and in circumstances like this, obviously 
there were some mistakes made (according to) the doctrine of the Catholic 
religion. I expect to take criticism for them, but I expect to learn from them 
and not make them again." 
</P>
<P>
Hitting even harder than King were the callers who were put on the air. 
</P>
<P>
A woman from San Diego asked if while he was engaged to Rebecka Mendenhall, had 
he told her that another woman had accused him of making her pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said he had not. 
</P>
<P>
A woman from Lakewood said: "I'm so upset with his self-righteous attitude. He 
says in interview after interview, if, if, if they are my children. He was 
sleeping with Miss Mendenhall. His self-righteousness makes me sick. He always 
talks about himself in the third person, and I wish he would cut the word again 
out of his vocabulary." 
</P>
<P>
Replied Garvey, after the woman hung up: "She must be a Giant fan." 
</P>
<P>
Then, returning to his serious mode, Garvey explained that, as to admitting he 
is the father, he has been advised, for legal reasons, not to make a statement 
one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
A caller from Treasure Island, Fla., asked if his new wife, Candace Thomas, is 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, he could have triplets," the caller said. "And run on a ticket with 
Ted Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said his wife, whom he earlier had called "my MVP" and "my pillar of 
strength," is not pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Said King: "This is going to be a rough year; 1989 is not going to be Steve 
Garvey's year." 
</P>
<P>
But at least he has had the courage to go on television and admit his mistakes. 
He deserves some credit for that. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Part I of Bud Greenspan's excellent film on the 1988 Winter Olympics, "Calgary 
'88: 16 Days of Glory," will be shown for the first time next Wednesday at 9 
p.m. on the Disney Channel. Part II will be shown in May. One of the four 
in-depth stories in part I is the Battle of the Brians, in which Brian Boitano 
beats out Brian Orser for the gold medal in men's figure skating. Greenspan 
tells the story in a marvelous fashion, offering footage and comments never 
before seen. Boitano, in an interview, says that during Orser's routine, he 
remained alone, huddled in a bathroom stall. And when teammate Chris Bowman, a 
practical joker, came to tell him he had won, Boitano was sure he was kidding. 
</P>
<P>
After viewing the film at a screening in Los Angeles last week, Boitano said to 
Greenspan: "I'm surprised more people haven't discovered your way of doing 
things. Everyone is treated equally, whether you're a figure skater or a ski 
jumper." Said Greenspan: "I spend 100% of my time on 90% of what is good." . . 
. The Battle of the Brians story is the final one in Part I. The first focuses 
on Canadian speed skater Gaetan Boucher, who won two gold medals in 1984 but 
finished ninth at Calgary; the second features cross-country skier Gunde Svan 
of Sweden, and the third is on ski jumper Matti Nykanen of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
College basketball, of course, dominates the weekend fare, but there's also 
prime-time, tape-delayed coverage of women's singles finals at the World Figure

NEWSWIRE: BROWNING WINS TITLE; BOWMAN SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canada's Kurt Browning put on a dazzling display of jumping, including a 
trademark quadruple, to edge Chris Bowman of Van Nuys for the men's gold medal 
at the World Figure Skating Championships Thursday in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, skating immediately after Browning, came through with a showy, flowing 
performance but had to be content with the silver. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's Grzegorz Filipowski upset an error-prone Alexandr Fadeev of the Soviet 
Union to take the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, fifth after the compulsory figures and second going into the final 
free-skating program, received seven marks of 5.9 for technical merit and four 
for artistic impression. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, the U.S. champion, was third going into the free skating behind Fadeev 
and Browning. 
</P>
<P>
Browning made one small slip halfway through the routine when he landed off 
balance on a triple axel but repeated the jump correctly in combination 15 
seconds later to earn Canada its fourth men's gold medal in the event and 
repeat countryman Brian Orser's 1987 success. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, 22, was sixth last year and eighth at the 1988 Calgary Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. champion Jill Trenary made a solid start in her bid for the women's title 
by placing second in the compulsory figures behind European champion Claudia 
Leistner of West Germany.

UNLV WARMS UP -- JUST IN TIME; 
</P>
<P>
REBELS HIT SOME FREE THROWS TO ELIMINATE IDAHO, 68-56 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BOISE, Ida. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kermit Davis, Idaho's 29-year-old coach, looked at Nevada Las Vegas on film and 
decided the Rebels could be beaten, and by his team. 
</P>
<P>
It would take an exceptionally good performance by Idaho and some cooperation 
-- perhaps at the free-throw line -- from UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it looked as if the Rebels were going to comply. They opened their 
first-round game of the NCAA West Regional playing poorly, and shooting worse. 
</P>
<P>
But they recovered after trailing early to score a 68-56 victory before 12,241 
fans -- most of them for Idaho -- in Boise State Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The victory sent the Rebels (27-7) into a second-round game against DePaul 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV started the game stone-cold, making only three of its first 20 shots. 
David Butler alone missed five shots in the lane in the first half, and the 
Rebels together botched 11 shots from the lane, shooting just 32% in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Had Idaho built a safer lead, it might have made things more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
But the Vandals -- who were led by Riley Smith's 20 points on body-banging 
inside play -- went up by only six. Then, trailing by five, UNLV's Stacey 
Augmon hit a 13-foot jumper, follwed by a three-pointer. The Vandals' lead was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
After one more basket, Idaho fell into a five-minute scoreless spell that 
lasted into the second minute of the second half -- by which time UNLV had a 
32-22 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, well aware of the Rebels' 63% free-throw percentage, still thought his 
team might have a chance in the late going. 
</P>
<P>
But UNLV hit 73% of its free throws -- including 17 of 21 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"If that team shoots free throws like that they're very hard to beat," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian, with the win in his pocket, could make somewhat 
light of the Rebels' frequent trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit some free throws," he said. "They were the sort that bounce around the 
rim and bounce in. I'll take them. I'd like to hit them like that for five more 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Stacey Augmon (17 points) and David Butler (16 points) led the Rebels in 
scoring, but UNLV got a crucial performance from Moses Scurry, who scored 10 
points, pulled down 14 rebounds and made four of five free throws, despite 
averaging only 47% 
</P>
<P>
"He's my main man, now," Tarkanian joked. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, the son of former Mississippi State Coach Kermit Davis Sr., guided the 
Vandals to 25 wins in his first season. 
</P>
<P>
He would have liked that to have been 26. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't give you anything cheap," Davis said of UNLV. "Even sometimes 
when they don't play real well, they always compete. And when you have great 
athletes competing, you're never out of the ball game."

ARIZONA QUICKLY SLAMS THE DOOR ON ROBERT MORRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

BOISE, Ida. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hint of suspense lasted no longer than it took for Ken Lofton to find 
Anthony Cook open for an alley-oop pass -- about 13 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
That was Arizona's first strike on the way to a 21-2 lead over Robert Morris in 
a game that ended -- mercifully for the Colonials -- in a 94-60 Arizona 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the top-ranked Wildcats took the first step toward returning to the 
Final Four for a second consecutive year, winning their first-round game in the 
West Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament before a 
crowd of 11,652 at Boise State Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona will play Clemson in the second round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a case where it was pretty obvious we had the much better talent," 
Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. "I thought we came out early and really took the 
game over. We shot really well and did the things we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Apologies to Robert Morris, but Arizona had only to make the tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a case of just too many people for them to deal with," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott, who made four three-pointers in four tries in the first half, led 
the way, finishing with 27 points and seven rebounds. And when it wasn't 
Elliott riddling the Colonial defense, it was Cook, who scored 25 points, eight 
of them on first-half dunks. 
</P>
<P>
The Colonials, from suburban Pittsburgh, also had to deal with their own case 
of what Coach Jarrett Durham called tournament jitters. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting 49% from the field all season, Robert Morris made only nine of 
37 attempts in the first half, and only 24 of 76 (31.6%) in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't put the ball in the hole," Durham said. "I think you can attribute 
that to the youngness of our basketball team and the greatness of Arizona. . . 
. What hurt more than anything else was we got open for easy shots but weren't 
able to convert. Once we fell behind, we got a little down on ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
It quickly became the kind of game at which it would have seemed polite to turn 
one's head. 
</P>
<P>
When the Colonials' Andre Boyd threw away a pass and covered his head with his 
hands in anguish, the wisdom in Robert Morris earning a bid to the NCAA 
tournament was not particularly evident. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we learned something," Boyd said. "We're very young. I hope we can 
come back next year. Maybe next year we'll win." 
</P>
<P>
For Arizona (28-3), it was a tournament debut along the order of the Wildcats' 
90-50 victory over Cornell in the first round last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Every game now -- we have five left, we hope -- it doesn't get any easier," 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats' only moments of concern in the game occurred when Jud Buechler 
turned an ankle in the second half and left the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our trainer feels that it shouldn't be a problem," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the ankle was iced immediately, swelling should be minimal and probably 
will not inhibit Buechler in the Wildcats' second-round game Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be a little bit sore, but he should be OK," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona got a somewhat unexpected boost from Sean Rooks, who scored 16 points, 
10 in the second half, and played solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
By the end, the game was slipping even further from Robert Morris' reach. Four 
of Arizona's final five field goals were dunks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a highlight show at the end," said forward Vaughn Luton, who led 
the Colonials (21-9) with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
On the final possession, Scott Shepherd got the ball around half-court and, 
unhurriedly, trailing by 34 with time left, he launched a 40-foot shot. It was 
not a desperation shot, more a resignation shot. It missed the basket and the 
long 40 minutes were over.

Willie Burton stayed up late the night before, cutting down to size the mask 
that protects his broken nose. Then he cut up Kansas State with his shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Burton scored 18 of his 29 points in the first half Thursday, and Minnesota 
downed the Wildcats, 86-75, in the first round of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. East Regional at Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"The first mask I wore (in practice), I couldn't see at all," Burton said. 
"This one wasn't much better. That's why I had to work on it. I filed away some 
of the plastic so I could see better and I cut out some of the padding so it 
would fit closer to my face." 
</P>
<P>
Burton hit eight of 15 shots, made 11 free throws without a miss and grabbed 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (18-11), which made only 77 three-point shots in 28 regular-season 
games, came out firing. The Gophers sank six of nine three-pointers in the 
first half, including four straight to take a 28-14 lead in the first 11:18. 
</P>
<P>
"Minnesota shot the ball very well in the first half, especially from 
three-point range," Kansas State Coach Lon Kruger said. "It was critical that 
they got on top of us early." 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers made eight of 12 three-pointers in the game, the last one by Melvin 
Newbern with 3:50 left after the Wildcats (19-11) used a full-court press to 
make a 14-4 run and slice the lead to 67-62. Newbern added two free throws to 
restore Minnesota's lead to 72-62. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Newbern's basket, Minnesota got a critical break after it appeared 
Kansas State's pressure had forced the Gophers into another turnover. However, 
the officials conferred and gave the ball back to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a tough stretch," Kansas State Coach Lon Kruger said. "You think 
you've got possession, five (points) down with four (minutes) to go. Now it's 
our possession and we're eight down." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Lynch scored 18 points and Newbern added 12 for Minnesota. Steve Henson 
scored 24 points and LaKeith Humphrey added 16 for Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second time Minnesota had beaten Kansas State this season. The 
Gophers won, 72-67, on Jan. 7 at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 90, South Carolina State 69 -- Phil Henderson scored a career-high 22 
points, and Danny Ferry added 18 as the ninth-ranked Blue Devils overpowered 
the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring 12 of its 20 first-half baskets on layups or dunks, Duke (25-4) led, 
49-34, by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Caldwell scored 20 points for South Carolina State (25-5), which was in 
the game at 25-22 when the Blue Devils blew away with 10 straight points. 
</P>
<P>
Duke had a 55-37 lead when the Bulldogs, in their first NCAA appearance, scored 
11 straight points and closed to 55-46. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina State closed to 58-50 on Steven Mazyck's three-pointer, but Duke 
ran off a 15-2 spurt for a 73-52 lead on Ferry's three-pointer with 8:52 left. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia 84, Tennessee 68 -- Herbie Brooks scored 22 points, and Ray 
Forster added 19 as the No. 17 Mountaineers overwhelmed the Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Dyron Nix vainly tried to keep Tennessee (19-11) in it, scoring 15 of his 22 
points in the first half, when West Virginia (26-4) built a 35-23 lead. Nix 
made seven of 14 shots in the half, but the rest of the Volunteers were two for 
17. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia scored the first six points of the second half to push the lead 
to 47-27 on Steve Berger's jumper with 16:53 remaining. The closest Tennessee 
got the rest of the way was 57-45 on Doug Roth's three-pointer with 10:28 left.

BARKLEY, 76ERS CUT KNICK HOME STRING AT 26 GAMES, 121-112 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Philadelphia 76ers, with Charles Barkley scoring a season-high 43 points, 
snapped the New York Knicks' 26-game winning streak at Madison Square Garden 
with a 121-112 victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks matched the second-longest single-season home winning streak in 
league history, falling five short of the mark held by Boston. The Celtics also 
had the longest home winning streak over two seasons (38) by winning their last 
31 at Boston Garden in 1985-86 and their first seven the following season. 
</P>
<P>
New York is 29-2 at home for the season, with their only previous loss coming 
against the Lakers, 110-98, Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"More important than their streak was the good chance we will play them in the 
first round of the playoffs," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason we put emphasis on this game. We haven't given up on winning 
the Atlantic Division, but we're seven or eight games behind. If we play them 
in the first round, every game will be a war. Since we beat them once here, we 
know now that we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
New York took its only lead of the second half, 59-58, on a dunk by Johnny 
Newman with 9:03 left in the third quarter. A tip-in by Mike Gminski gave the 
76ers the lead for good and started a 9-0 run that gave them a 67-59 advantage. 
The closest the Knicks got after that was five points, the last time at 85-80 
with 10:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks tried to catch up in the final minutes, but the 76ers made most of 
their free throws down the stretch to stay comfortably in front. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing had 27 points and Charles Oakley 25 points and 18 rebounds for 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 111, Indiana 99 -- Kevin McHale scored 36 points and the Celtics held 
the Pacers scoreless for nearly four minutes in the win at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Celtics' fourth straight victory and their second in a row over the 
Pacers after losing the first two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
A layup by Robert Parrish gave Boston the lead for good, 83-81, with 9:20 left. 
A pair of jumpers by Randy Wittman pulled Indiana to within one point twice, 
the last time at 88-87 with 7:40 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pacers didn't score again until Chuck Person hit two free throws with 
3:54 left, when the Celtics had a 98-89 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 120, Milwaukee 104 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 32 points and 17 rebounds, and 
Otis Thorpe had his first career triple-double with 10 points, 11 rebounds and 
a career-high 10 assists in the Rocket win at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets led just 77-76 with 1:48 left in the third quarter, but Olajuwon 
scored five points to spark a 13-2 run that put Houston in command, 90-78, 
early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 108, Charlotte 88 -- The SuperSonics held the Hornets scoreless for a 
span of 7:45 in the second and third quarters, and Dale Ellis scored 32 points 
as host Seattle extended Charlotte's losing streak to nine. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics snapped a five-game losing streak -- all the defeats came on 
the road -- and improved to 1-4 under interim Coach Bob Kloppenburg, who took 
over after Bernie Bickerstaff was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 119, Sacramento 103 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 27 points as the Hawks 
won at Sacramento in a game marred by the ejection of King Coach Jerry 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds was thrown out for unsportsmanlike conduct with 5:21 remaining after 
being restrained from going after official Nolan Fine, who called an offensive 
foul on Jim Petersen. Official Hugh Evans and King assistant Coach Herman Kull 
wrapped their arms around Reynolds at halfcourt to prevent him from reaching 
Fine. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ainge scored 36 for Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 119, San Antonio 102 -- Alex English scored 32 points as the Nuggets 
improved their home record to 28-5.

Tom Barrasso stopped 32 shots, and Rob Brown scored the game-winning goal late 
in the second period as the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the New Jersey Devils, 
2-1, Thursday night at East Rutherford, N.J., to clinch their first playoff 
berth in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Pittsburgh reached the Stanley Cup playoffs was in 1981-82, two 
years before it drafted superstar Mario Lemieux. The NHL's leading scorer, 
Lemieux injured his groin in a pregame skate Thursday morning and did not 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave the Penguins 79 points and moved them into second place in the 
Patrick Division, one point ahead of the New York Rangers and one behind the 
first-place Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey, on the verge of playoff elimination, lost its third straight game.

<P>
Quebec 2, Boston 2 -- Robert Picard's goal at 5:53 of the third period lifted 
the Nordiques into a tie at Boston and kept their hopes alive for a playoff 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
Picard's goal came only 1:11 after rookie Greg Hawgood's power-play goal gave 
Boston a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the return of 25-year-old defenseman Gord Kluzak to the Bruin 
lineup. He missed 71 games following surgery on his left knee on Sept. 17 -- 
his eighth operation. Kluzak sat out two of the last four full seasons with 
knee trouble. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Brett Hull's second goal of the game, at 1:39 of 
overtime, gave the Blues the win at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues are 4-1-1 in their last six games, while Philadelphia dropped to 
1-3-4 in their last eight and fell to 32-32-7, the latest in the season they 
have been at only the .500 mark since 1971-72. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis beat the Flyers for the third straight time this season and second in 
a row at the Spectrum. Previously, the Blues had not won in 34 games at 
Philadelphia. Vincent Riendeau has been in goal for St. Louis in all three 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 6, Hartford 1 -- Mike Foligno scored his 300th career goal, goaltender 
Clint Malarchuk remained unbeaten since being traded to Buffalo March 6, and 
the Sabres blitzed the Whalers at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
The victory clinched a playoff spot for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6, Chicago 1 -- Rookie Don Barber had his first NHL hat trick, Mike 
Gartner scored his 400th career goal, and Mark Habscheid had four assists to 
lead the North Stars at Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, Edmonton 0 -- Petri Skriko scored twice in the second period, and 
Kirk McLean recorded his fourth shutout of the season at Vancouver as the 
Oilers' winless streak reached six (0-4-2). 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver is 9-0-2 in its last 11 outings and beat the Oilers for the fifth 
time in seven meetings.

NEWSWIRE: SOVIET PAIR GET TOP MARKS IN ICE DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko, runners-up the last four years, earned 
two perfect 6.0s to take the original set pattern portion of the ice dance 
competition at the World Figure Skating Championships Thursday in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet couple gained top marks from the Soviet and Czechoslovakian judges 
with a Charleston routine that kept them on course for the gold medal with only 
the free dance to come. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Wynne and Joseph Druar of the United States stayed in fifth place in the 
ice dance. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Trenary, the United States champion, made a solid start in her bid for the 
women's title by placing second in the compulsory figures behind European 
champion Claudia Leistner of West Germany.

SPRING BREAK: TIME FOR A FINAL FLING ON SLOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Lochner 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the East and Midwest, spring break means heading for Florida to thaw out. In 
much of the West, it is just as likely to mean heading for the mountains and 
one last fling on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Just depends on where you've been all winter. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions are still relatively good as the Easter holidays get under way 
today, and most major California ski areas plan to operate into April. It's 
definitely spring in the San Gabriel Mountains and at Big Bear Lake, but the 
Sierra appears to be reverting to winter, at least for a few days, as another 
storm passes through. 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth Mountain reported a foot of new snow on top of a six-foot base 
Thursday, with more coming down, and the resorts around Lake Tahoe have also 
picked up a layer of fresh powder. 
</P>
<P>
Bear Mountain, in Big Bear, will celebrate "Spring Break I" Saturday through 
March 26 with live music on the lodge sun deck, daily contests and giveaways. 
Neighboring Snow Summit, not to be outdone, also has several special events 
scheduled, including the Suzuki Snowboarding Safari, which offers free 
demonstrations and lessons in this new sport, Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Valley and Mountain High (West) are also still operating daily in the 
Southland, and Kratka Ridge plans to reopen for the weekend. Mt. Waterman, Mt. 
Baldy and Ski Sunrise are closed pending the arrival of more snow. 
</P>
<P>
National champions will be determined this weekend on both the men's and 
women's circuits of the U.S. Pro Tour. 
</P>
<P>
The men are at Sugarbush, Vt., for their finals, with Phil Mahre poised to 
overtake Jorgen Sundqvist of Sweden and win the 1989 Audi Quattro 200 that goes 
with the season-long championship, not to mention a bundle of cash for gas. 
</P>
<P>
Mahre, 31, three-time World Cup champion and 1984 Olympic gold medalist, swept 
both races last weekend at Snow Summit and trails Sundqvist by just 15 points, 
500 to 485. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my chances are as good as Sundqvist's," Mahre said this week. "Right 
now, I'm looking at winning both those races at Sugarbush (and earning 35 
points in each). I'm really confident." 
</P>
<P>
The women's competition, at Mammoth Mountain today through Sunday, is being 
billed as the Isuzu World Championships, and three racers remain in contention 
for the title -- rookie Catharina Glasser-Bjerner of Sweden, with 331 points; 
Birgit Hussauf of Austria, with 303, and defending champion Roswitha Raudaschl 
of Austria, with 300. 
</P>
<P>
Raudaschl is streaking. She won the slalom last weekend at Hatoriko, Japan, and 
placed second to Andreja Leskovsek of Yugoslavia in the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Ski Team, which wound up 11th out of 18 in the Nations' Cup standings 
this season, is competing in the National Alpine Ski Championships at Crested 
Butte, Colo., this week and next. 
</P>
<P>
The men's giant slalom Thursday was won by Kyle Wieche, 21, in 2:31.72, with 
Joe Levins, 20, second in 2:32.09 and Tommy Moe, 19, third in 2:32.81. The 
remainder of the schedule: today -- women's giant slalom; Saturday -- men's and 
women's slaloms; Sunday -- men's and women's giant slaloms; next Thursday -- 
men's and women's downhills. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland won the Nations' Cup with a total of 2,305 points on the men's and 
women's circuits, which included victories in 31 of the 59 World Cup events. 
</P>
<P>
Austria was second with 2,061 points, followed by West Germany with 878. The 
United States had 232. Bernhard Gstrein of Austria defeated Pirmin Zurbriggen 
of Switzerland, and Chantal Bournissen of Switzerland beat Michaela Gerg of 
West Germany in the finals of the parallel slaloms last Sunday at Shiga Kogen, 
Japan, which counted toward the Nations' Cup but not in the World Cup 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg ended the season with 357 points, 48 more than 
runner-up Zurbriggen, in winning his third men's overall World Cup. Vreni 
Schneider led a 1-2-3 Swiss women's overall sweep with 376 points, 115 ahead of 
Maria Walliser, who was only 13 in front of Michela Figini. 
</P>
<P>
Tamara McKinney of Olympic Valley, Calif., who was third in the parallel race, 
finished 11th in the overall standings with 116 points. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989-90 World Cup schedule will open with a men's slalom and giant slalom 
at Thredbo, Australia, on Aug. 12-13, and a women's giant slalom and super-G at 
Las Lenas, Argentina, sometime in mid-August. Then there's a long break until 
action resumes Nov. 24-26 at Park City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>

DAVE PERRY, A STICKLER FOR THE RULES, GETS STUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most racing sailors agree that on-the-water judging is the best thing to happen 
to the sport since fiberglass, since it eliminates the tiresome process of 
protest hearings late into the night to settle petty disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no competitor has a better grasp of the complex rules than Dave Perry, 
the 1983 and '84 winner of the Congressional Cup. He has written books on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
But it was probably inevitable that someday Dave Perry would have a head-on 
collision with the system, and it happened Thursday in the fifth round of the 
25th Congressional match-racing series at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While Rod Davis was winning two more races to lead the 10-man fleet with a 5-0 
record, Perry, 3-2, was running afoul of the judges and Eddie Owen, 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
In moderate winds, Owen had overtaken Perry on the first downwind leg of the 
second round. Perry was fighting to hold the inside overlap position that by 
the rules obligate Owen to give Perry room to round the leeward mark first. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, the bill of his cap turned up, as is his style, called, "Overlap!" 
</P>
<P>
Owen ignored him, turning his boat left around the orange inflatable buoy and 
forcing Perry to turn hard right to avoid a collision. In this situation, the 
onus is on Perry to prove he had an overlap. 
</P>
<P>
"He was shouting, 'Overlap!" said Owen, the '87 Congressional winner. "I said 
there no overlap. As we came into the mark we luffed up a little bit and were 
slowly breaking the overlap. I'm looking to see how far we are from the mark 
and looking behind me trying to see when we broke the overlap. The jury must 
have agreed with me." 
</P>
<P>
Under the system introduced in the Congressional last year, the judges 
shadowing the race in a small powerboat were John Ripard of Malta, Graeme 
Hayward of Canada and Ed Feo of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Before the boats were around the mark, both had protest flags flying, and the 
judges held up Perry's code letter, E, as a signal to perform a 270-degree turn 
as a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Perry shouted at the judges over the water for several seconds in protest. 
</P>
<P>
"We were quite satisfied there was no overlap," Ripard said. "All three judges 
on our boat agreed." 
</P>
<P>
They said that Owen had broken the overlap about three lengths from the mark, 
giving Owen the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no question," Ripard said. "This is why we have on-the-water 
judging." 
</P>
<P>
But the issue didn't end there. Perry failed to perform his penalty turn, as 
Owen went on to win by 55 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Perry later requested a hearing for redress from the jury but declined to talk 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a courtesy," Ripard said. "We could have black-flagged him (for not 
doing the penalty turn)." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hayward said that Perry told the judges he thought he'd seen 
a green flag, indicating no penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESSIONAL CUP -- The series continues with two rounds today and two more 
Saturday. Rod Davis, the '81 and '85 winner, defeated defending champion Peter 
Gilmour, 3-2, of Australia and Steve Steiner, 1-4, of Long Beach to run his 
record to 5-0. San Diego's Peter Isler slipped to 4-1 in losing to Anaheim's 
John Bertrand, 3-2, representing the St. Francis Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE -- Coach Craig Wilson's UC Irvine team won the Trux-Ulmstead 
intercollegiate dinghy regatta at the Naval Academy last weekend, qualifying to 
defend its national title as top seed at Chicago in June. Lead skipper Jon 
Pinckney of Newport Beach was second in A Division with crew Mike Sturman and 
Geoff Becker, while James Malm won B Division with crew Scott Munch and Nick 
Scandone, all sailing 420s. Sailing single-handed Lasers, Nick Adamson was 
fifth in C Division and Randy Lake third in D. Irvine scored 280 points, 
followed by Old Dominion, 289; Tulane, 303; Navy, 326, and Charleston, 342. 
</P>
<P>
PRO -- Olympic gold medalist Allison Jolly of Long Beach, with crewman Larry 
Tuttle, will compete in the new One-Design 14 dinghy division of the four-event 
Ziploc Ultimate Yacht Race series starting March 22-26 at San Francisco. Jolly 
won the Olympic women's 470 class with crew member Lynne Jewell and they shared 
the Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year award. Ten boats will compete for $10,000 at 
San Francisco. Jolly is the only woman in the fleet. John Kolius will defend 
his title in the Ultimate 30 class. He won $113,000 last year.

EVEN AN APPLE A DAY CAN'T KEEP TWINKIES AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's Twinkie-trashing time, again. 
</P>
<P>
It all began when State Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer suggested in 
a news conference Tuesday that school districts were sending the wrong message 
to children by banning apples -- which may have been treated with the chemical 
Alar -- from the lunchroom. They'd be worse off, he suggested, if they turned 
to Twinkies instead. 
</P>
<P>
If kids don't eat fruits and vegetables, he said, "What are they going to eat? 
Twinkies . . . and other junk?" Such a junk diet, Kizer warned, has been shown 
to cause cancer, heart disease, hypertension and other chronic ailments. 
</P>
<P>
There you have what is known among the cognoscenti as the Twinkie threat. Once 
baby teeth start sinking into a Twinkie, the theory goes, children will become 
hooked on those creme-filled sponge-cake torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
But, alas, with the exception of certain Twinkie-free zones in scattered parts 
of the country, the worst has already happened. Twinkies are on the street and 
in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Kavis, a cafeteria worker at Santa Ana High School in Orange County, 
says kids demand them. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell Twinkies," she says. "We always have and we always will." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District, however, doesn't allow Twinkies to be sold 
at its schools -- over the counter, that is -- although candy bars and corn 
chips are big sellers. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect it's a cultural bias," says one school official at North Hollywood 
High School, who, fearing retribution from nutritional purists, refused to give 
his name. "It's a peculiar formula (within the district) where the food has to 
have 4% of the required nutrients. You have to have the wisdom of Solomon to 
figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Twinkies harbor any pretensions. Their main ingredient, listed on the 
package, is sugar, followed by enriched flour. The standard recipe, which 
hasn't changed since the banana creme filling was replaced with the 
vanilla-flavored stuff in the 1940s, supplies 2% of the recommended daily 
allowance for protein, 6% each for thiamin and riboflavin and 4% each for 
niacin, calcium and iron. 
</P>
<P>
This does not exactly put the Twinkie in the same league as, say, an oat 
bran-whole wheat-with-no-chemical-additives muffin. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't promote them as a nutritional kind of thing," says Twinkie 
spokeswoman Catherine Dunkin of the Continental Baking Co. in St. Louis. "The 
thing about Twinkies is that if you have a balanced diet, you can enjoy them 
now and then." 
</P>
<P>
Now and then? Sales records show that generations of Americans have gone 
berserk over Twinkies (a legal defense, incidentally, which convinced a jury in 
1979 that former San Francisco Supervisor Dan White should be convicted of 
manslaughter, instead of murder in the shooting of Mayor George Moscone and 
Supervisor Harvey Milk). 
</P>
<P>
And little did Kizer know when he sounded the Twinkie alarm at his Los Angeles 
news conference that more Twinkies are sold here than any place else except 
Chicago, the birthplace of the Twinkie in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twinkies for School Districts 
</P>
<P>
Dunkin says that billions of Twinkies have been consumed by Americans over the 
years, including the millions that the company sells annually to school 
districts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say Twinkies are the quintessential junk food, but I believe in 
the things," are the words that Jimmy Dewar, the father of the Twinkie, left to 
the world when he died at the age of 88 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I fed them to my four kids, and they feed them to my 15 grandchildren," he 
said. "My boy Jimmy played football for the Cleveland Browns. My other son, 
Bobby, played quarterback for the University of Rochester. Twinkies never hurt 
them." 
</P>
<P>
So has Kenneth W. Kizer ever indulged in a Twinkie? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I have eaten Twinkies," he says, "And in days gone by, I probably ate too 
many. . . . And I even give them to my kids. When consumed in moderation, 
Twinkies are fine."

EASING INTO STARDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Isaac Mizrahi didn't ask to be the new golden boy of fashion. He swears he 
didn't even take anybody to lunch. Yet, after hardly a year in business, he's 
called the Brooklyn-born nebbish turned matinee idol and the newest star by 
industry kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have Calvin Klein's looks, Ralph Lauren's suavity or Bill Blass' 
class. But he has a client list they can relate to, with Liza Minnelli and 
Candice Bergen at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Success, however, is taking its toll on the 27-year-old designer. He chain 
smokes, doesn't complete one thought before he's on to the next and exists in 
such a state of adrenaline buzz that one cup of coffee makes him virtually 
explode in nervous energy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be a dope not to feel all the pressure from the outside, but the minute I 
start getting nervous I focus on the clothes," he says. Already, that ability 
to focus has won him the Perry Ellis Award for New Fashion Talent, bestowed by 
the powerful Council of Fashion Designers of America. 
</P>
<P>
And there is no denying his original style: A blend of activewear shapes and 
luxury fabrics for a look he describes as "selective ease." 
</P>
<P>
He actually invents new words to describe his more unusual fashion ideas. This 
spring, for example, there is the Mizrahi "jumpshirt," a jumpsuit cut as loose 
and comfortably as a body-length shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Other specials for spring are the evening pants that could pass for pajamas 
with a drawstring waist, except that they are made of rich satin. He pushes the 
fashion-ease idea further when he sends models down a runway, wearing oversize 
outfits only half buttoned up. 
</P>
<P>
Mizrahi says he's just trying to fill a fashion void. "What's missing from the 
American market is comfortable clothes that work in the same context as very 
hard, tailored things." 
</P>
<P>
Women may be stopped cold by his prices -- including the $760 sports dresses 
and $1,400 robes that he showed at I. Magnin in Beverly Hills. But, he 
believes, the clothes offer a lot for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim in sportswear is to be able to buy one or two pieces and wear them all 
week long, and look different every single day," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Women who buy one designer's complete outfit end up with a packaged look, and 
that is just what they deserve, he says. A couple of pieces from a collection 
are enough. 
</P>
<P>
When a customer at I. Magnin asked what to wear with the designer's $475 pants 
and $440 silk jacket, Mizrahi suggested a white Hanes T-shirt and assured her, 
"That's really chic."

Mizrahi's parents were his earliest fashion inspirations. His first lessons 
came from his mother, Sara, who to him looked "just divine, whether she wore a 
Chanel suit or something from Orbach's basement or my father's pajamas at the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
His father manufactured children's clothes while Isaac was growing up in 
Brooklyn, attending the Flatbush Yeshiva and later Parsons School of Design. 
</P>
<P>
Before opening his business, Mizrahi was an assistant to the late Perry Ellis.

SHADES OF EXCITEMENT AT COLORFUL MENSWEAR SHOW

To her right and left were rooms filled with fall menswear in delicious shades 
of honey, grape, cranberry, burnt orange and mustard -- all of which prompted 
Elyse Kroll to think pink. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago pink wasn't acceptable, color wasn't acceptable. The face of 
menswear was totally different from what it is today," observed Kroll, the New 
York-based producer of Mode Coast Los Angeles (MCLA), a trade show of 
international menswear designers, which she brought to the Beverly Hilton Hotel 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt about it, menswear has come a long way. And although there wasn't much 
pink displayed by the 43 manufacturers during the three-day event, there were 
all those tasty new fall tones and plenty of enticing labels, including Jhane 
Barnes, Basco, Joan Vass, Perry Ellis, Andrew Fezza, Jekyll &amp; Hyde, 
Modules, A.B.S. and Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
First-day shoppers included Michael and Hilary Anderson, owners of Clacton 
&amp; Frinton in West Hollywood, who were looking for "basics: sweaters, ties, 
socks" and wished MCLA's debut show "were bigger." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bob Carriere, owner of Carriere in the Beverly Center, 
complained there was "a little too much selection. I've seen 53 mock 
turtlenecks, and now I've got to figure out which one to buy." 
</P>
<P>
No such dilemma for Ron Herman, owner of the Ron Herman store in Brentwood and 
Fred Segal on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
He had found a denim shirt by For Joseph, an L.A. company, that he "loved." 
Plucking the shirt from a rack, Herman praised its destroyed-look fabric: "This 
feels authentic-old. It feels honest." 
</P>
<P>
He had additional kind words for "the spicy colors" in the collection of New 
York-based Giuseppe E Luciano, praise for the "easy, all-cotton sweaters" of 
Anne Mieke, another New York firm. He liked the "details and personality" of 
tie-patterned shirts made in England by Jekyll &amp; Hyde, and he expressed 
more love for velvet-collared houndstooth jackets, suede-look silk blazers and 
antique-looking brocade vests from Los Angeles-based A.B.S. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are showing a dramatic interest in changing the way they dress. A man used 
to go to dinner or to a movie in the same thing. Now he has a more playful 
attitude. Take the antique vest; men are wearing it with anything." 
</P>
<P>
While fall menswear has been tagged "old made new" by some observers, not 
everyone was happy with the description. According to Modules owner-designer 
Toshiya Takahasi, his wide, boldly patterned ties "are not retro. This is not 
the '40s and '50s gangster look. This is more contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling equally contemporary was Daniela Passini, whose first menswear 
collection under her own label was introduced in Milan earlier this year. Using 
the themes of "born free" and "modern mysticism," Passini explained her 
jackets, overcoats, "Hollywood" high-waisted trousers, St. Sebastian-motif 
shirts and tubular wool sweaters are directed at "a carefree customer." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Bill Austin is another designer who has fun with menswear. 
His fall collection includes cotton long johns meant to be worn under trousers 
or shorts. And his most colorful pieces are wool jackets and vests that 
incorporate sections from vintage European blankets. 
</P>
<P>
Austin's view of menswear was as upbeat as anyone's at the show: "There's a 
wonderful revolution going on," he observed, adding what is likely to become an 
industry cliche: "Men want to dress differently." 
</P>
<P>
As for Elyse Kroll, she would be back with future shows. After all, she 
explained with crusading conviction, "Los Angeles is a fashion capital waiting 
to happen."

Paula Abdul may turn out to be the most popular female dance-music artist since 
Janet Jackson was controlling the pop charts a few years ago. Abdul's "Forever 
Your Girl" album -- up to No. 4 on the Billboard magazine pop chart -- just 
crossed the 1-million mark. Fine Young Cannibals' album -- "The Raw and the 
Cooked" (No. 16) -- is by far the hottest new release of the last few weeks. 
Madonna's "Like a Prayer" single, No. 25 in just two weeks, looks like a Top 10 
shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
* Guitarist Vernon Reid is having the last laugh on all those skeptics who said 
his Living Colour, like just about every other black rock band, would never 
make it. But he insisted their "Vivid" album was too good to ignore. Fans 
eventually agreed. The album, slow to catch on, finally made the Top 10 -- at 
No. 9.

UCI HOSPITAL THREATENS TO DROP MEDI-CAL CONTRACT

<P>
UC Irvine officials threatened Thursday to stop treating the county's poor at 
UCI Medical Center -- other than for emergencies -- in order to save the 
hospital from financial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Jack W. Peltason told the University of California Board of Regents 
that the debt-burdened medical center in Orange is the victim of a breakdown in 
the mechanism for treating the county's poorest patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hospital is in jeopardy because of what can only be described as a 
collapse of the health care system established in Orange County to provide for 
the needs of the indigent and the working poor," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
The medical center, which has only 6% of the county's hospital beds, is 
treating more than half of the county's indigent patients, he said. The 
hospital, which has a total of 493 beds, is reimbursed for less than half of 
what it costs to care for those patients. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Peltason said, every additional Medi-Cal patient who enters the 
facility adds to its rising operating deficit. That deficit is projected to top 
$13 million in the fiscal year that ends June 30, and it could reach $15 
million next year. 
</P>
<P>
If UCI cannot obtain more funds from Medi-Cal -- the university is seeking a 
17% increase -- and cap the number of such patients it must treat, the medical 
center will have no choice but to end its contractual relationship with the 
state-run medical program, Peltason said. In that case, the center would treat 
only those indigent patients who are critically ill or about to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
Non-emergencies now represent about 15% of the hospital's Medi-Cal caseload, 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding to end the Medi-Cal contract is something the university would not "do 
lightly," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a termination would disrupt our teaching programs, threaten the health of 
those we serve and heighten short-term financial difficulties as we make a 
transition to more private patients," he said. "But it is an option that we 
must and are seriously considering." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions, Criticism 
</P>
<P>
UCI's declaration was generally well received by the regents, who met at UC San 
Francisco. They asked university officials about the continuing deficits for 
the medical center, and several criticized the county government for not having 
done something to distribute the burden of treating non-paying patients among 
more hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
From his office in Orange County, Thomas E. Uram, director of the Orange County 
Health Care Agency, applauded UCI's stand in the Medi-Cal reimbursement issue 
but declined to comment on the matter of whether the county contributes its 
share. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the county, which has no public hospital for the poor, had five 
major Medi-Cal contractors. Two of them -- United Western Medical Centers and 
Chapman General -- have already terminated their Medi-Cal contracts. Fountain 
Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center has notified the state that it 
intends to cancel its contract June 30. The only other remaining hospital still 
to have a Medi-Cal contract is Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim. Officials 
there said Thursday that their hospital will not drop out. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do everything possible to change the orientation of the county 
toward the importance of this institution," said Regent Frank W. Clark Jr. of 
UCI Medical Center. "They have an asset there for which it is absolutely 
impossible to quantify the benefits to their constituents." 
</P>
<P>
Regent Roy T. Brophy said the county government wants the medical center to be 
"a county hospital under a different name." He predicted that the crisis in 
care for the poor is "only going to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I applaud you for taking this step," he said to Peltason. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good for UCI' 
</P>
<P>
Uram said UCI's ultimatum may force the state to raise its Medi-Cal 
reimbursement rates to UCI Medical Center and other hospitals in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is about time someone stands up to the state. Good for UCI," Uram 
said. "I have been telling the state they cannot keep ratcheting the prices 
down. There is a crisis coming, and the state is causing it." 
</P>
<P>
The reimbursements provided for in Medi-Cal contracts, which are negotiated 
with each hospital, have not kept up with rising medical costs and the increase 
of poor patients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Uram said that if Orange County's two remaining major Medi-Cal contractors drop 
out, the state will end up paying out more because hospitals will bill on a 
daily basis for emergency and other treatments rather than bill by the 
discounted contract rate. He would not respond, however, to UCI Medical Center 
complaints that the county is contributing to its deficit because of its 
reimbursement rate for treatment of indigent patients who do not qualify for 
Medi-Cal. The rate is about 40 cents for each dollar of hospital services. UCI 
Medical Center estimated that it lost $11 million caring for these patients 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We negotiate rates at the table with these hospitals, so I'll reserve my 
comments for the negotiating table," Uram said. "If I had more money to pass 
out, I'd love to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County hospital executives expressed concern that as the trend to 
drop Medi-Cal contracts snowballs, one or two hospitals would be flooded with 
Medi-Cal emergency cases and that, therefore, poor patients whose illnesses are 
not critical would simply not be treated. Officials at Fountain Valley Regional 
Hospital, which is participating in negotiations to prevent its withdrawal, 
said that a decision by UCI Medical Center to drop out would make Fountain 
Valley's withdrawal certain. 
</P>
<P>
"Without UCI in the program, it would put an additional burden on us, and quite 
frankly, I don't know if we could handle the volume," said Thomas Ways, chief 
financial officer of the for-profit hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"And if everybody is dropping the program, where will the Medi-Cal patients go? 
Hospitals are being squeezed all over the state, and there has to be a 
revamping of the program to make it fair and equitable for hospitals to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
The problem for UCI Medical Center is that the more public patients it treats, 
the fewer private patients it will be able to attract or accept. 
</P>
<P>
This year, UCI expects about 47% of its patients to be Medi-Cal members and 
nearly 70% of all its patients to be public patients of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
But a flood of public patients is a problem that can affect rich as well as 
poor, said Dr. Walter Henry, who is about to take over as dean of the UCI 
College of Medicine. Henry also addressed the regents. He said that about seven 
times a month, the hospital has been forced to curtail admissions because there 
were too many patients in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think that what we are witnessing is not only the collapse of the 
indigent care system, but we are potentially witnessing in Orange County what 
has been threatened in Los Angeles County -- the collapse of the emergency care 
system as well," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter whether you are wealthy or poor; if a hospital is on 
paramedic bypass and your ambulance can't find a hospital to admit you, you are 
being affected by that very directly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the university does cancel its contract, a step hospital director Mary 
Piccione said is "imminent," it will take about 2 years for the medical 
center's finances to stabilize, Peltason said. He said the medical center could 
lose another $6 million to $10 million a year for 2 years because although it 
will have fewer Medi-Cal patients, it will not have rebuilt a base of private 
patients.

COURT LETS STAND MUNICIPAL BANS ON ASSAULT RIFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday refused to prevent Los Angeles and other 
California cities from enforcing recently enacted bans on the sale and 
possession of military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order signed by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, the court declined, 
at least for now, to hear arguments from gun owners opposed to the bans. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the high court directed that the cases be sent for review first by the 
state Court of Appeal here. The action allows the bans to remain in effect 
while the matter is before the appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication when the appellate court will rule on the cases. And, 
whatever the outcome, the matter could return to the high court on another 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Validity of Bans 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the validity of bans on semiautomatic weapons imposed in Los 
Angeles, Berkeley, Stockton and Santa Clara County. The bans were imposed in 
the wake of the fatal shootings of five children in Stockton by an assailant 
wielding an AK-47 assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
In suits challenging the ordinances, gun owners backed by the National Rifle 
Assn. contended that gun laws enacted by the state Legislature preempt local 
communities from enforcing their own restrictions on firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The gun owners urged the high court to take jurisdiction in the matter 
directly, without waiting for review by lower courts, and issue an order 
blocking enforcement of the ordinances until the justices could decide their 
legality. 
</P>
<P>
In response, attorneys for the city of Los Angeles and other municipalities 
argued that existing state controls on such weapons as machine guns or 
sawed-off shotguns did not prevent local communities from acting on their own 
against assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Particularly Dangerous' 
</P>
<P>
"Assault weapons are designed for warfare and combine certain attributes which 
make them particularly dangerous in an urban environment," Los Angeles city 
attorneys said in a brief to the court. "They are used almost daily in Los 
Angeles in some effort to take human life." 
</P>
<P>
Since the ordinance went into effect in Los Angeles earlier this month, 
officials have notified commercial firearms sellers of its prohibitions and 
police are enforcing the measure as cases arise, according to Assistant City 
Atty. Byron R. Boeckman. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not going to be any door-to-door, house-to-house searches," Boeckman 
said. "If police find weapons in the ordinary course of an investigation, or in 
carrying out a search warrant, the ordinance would be enforced in that way." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Legislature must yet reconcile two bills -- one passed by the 
Assembly, one approved by the Senate -- that would outlaw semiautomatic assault 
weapons throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
However, the effect of such legislation on local measures is still not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Reginald D. Steer, a San Francisco attorney representing gun owners in the 
NRA-supported suits, said Thursday that statewide legislation would make clear 
that gun control is the exclusive province of the state and that local controls 
are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Boeckman, however, refused to concede the point. The Legislature has yet to 
agree on one bill, he noted, and legislation that is passed might not take 
effect until January. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Thursday, the justices agreed to decide a case that could cost 
insurance companies millions of dollars and provide new tax revenue to 
California cities. 
</P>
<P>
The court said it would review contentions by the city of Los Angeles that 
municipalities can impose business taxes on investment properties owned by 
insurers. The city has collected over $1 million in such revenue but last 
December a state Court of Appeal ruled that a provision of the state 
Constitution exempts insurers from the tax, even on property that they do not 
use in their businesses.

VICTIMS' FAMILIES LAUNCH JUDICIAL REFORM INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharon Tate's mother was there, almost 20 years after the fact. So was the 
family of famed car racing promoter Mickey Thompson and his wife, Trudy, who 
were slain one year ago to the day. So were John and Patsy Gillis; only their 
daughter's murder never became a media sensation. 
</P>
<P>
These survivors-turned-activists, joined by friends and prosecutors, Thursday 
observed the anniversary of the still-unsolved Thompson slayings by launching 
an initiative campaign to reform a justice system they consider unjust, 
molasses-slow and overprotective of the criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fond hope today is that very soon the killers will be caught and brought 
to justice," Danny Thompson, Mickey's son, said during a press conference at 
Rose Hills Memorial Park near Whittier. "Now we are preparing for that day." 
</P>
<P>
Despite two frustrating political forays last year, soldiers in California's 
victims' rights movement expressed confidence -- thanks, in part, to the 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"The movement is making progress," explained retired Los Angeles Police Lt. 
John Gillis, whose daughter, Louarana, was killed by a gang member in 1979. 
"We've got more victims. That's really what it amounts to." 
</P>
<P>
The reform effort -- dubbed "M.O.V.E. to Rescue Justice," with M.O.V.E. 
signifying "Memory of Victims Everywhere" -- proposes a 13-point plan intended 
to quicken trials and increase penalties in some crimes. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 signatures of qualified registered voters must be gathered to 
place the initiative on the 1990 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Tate's mother, Doris, predicted success, saying that with the help of a 
National Enquirer article, she has netted 352,000 signatures opposing the 
paroles of various Charles Manson family members since 1984. Actress Tate and 
eight others were brutally slain in a monthlong murder spree in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors representing Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego and Kern counties 
participated in the press conference. They included several who were active in 
the successful 1986 campaign to oust California Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the initiative would, in effect, overturn several procedural rulings by 
the Bird court, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our system has become a monument of technicalities," complained Anthony 
Rackauckas, a former Orange County deputy district attorney and an author of 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
For crime victims, said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. James P. Cloninger, 
"one of the most agonizing things about their sojourn through the criminal 
justice system is having to wait. And wait and wait and wait." 
</P>
<P>
Major felonies in California often take two years to come to trial, the 
prosecutors said, while in other states and in the federal courts, six months 
is thought to be unusually long. 
</P>
<P>
To speed up trials, the measure would require that hearings and trials be set 
within specified time limits, that court-appointed defense attorneys be 
required to prepare cases and that judges be given greater control of the jury 
selection process. It would also allow two or more offenses charged against one 
defendant be tried as one case. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would generally toughen penalties for murderers -- including 
providing a life-without-parole sentence for juveniles convicted of 
first-degree murder with "special circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Such a conviction for adults is penalized by death. 
</P>
<P>
It would also require that defense attorneys, who now are guaranteed to review 
evidence against the defendant, likewise reveal the defense witnesses' 
identities and statements to the prosecution before trial. 
</P>
<P>
Such "reciprocal discovery" is required in federal court, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Rackauckas said, a legislative effort to make such reforms became 
bottled up in committees. The measures, he said, were opposed by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown and Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti, as well as 
by lobbying from the defense lawyers groups. An initiative effort was abandoned 
shortly after it began. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the movement is better organized. "We'll go all the way," 
said Collene Thompson Campbell, a leader of the initiative effort. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is Mickey Thompson's sister, but she became active years before her 
brother and sister-in-law were slain in the driveway of their Bradbury Estates 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, her son, Scott Campbell, was murdered. Two men were later convicted of 
throwing him off an airplane near Santa Catalina Island. His body was never 
found, and a funeral has never been held. 
</P>
<P>
Now one of the men is out of prison, she said, his conviction overturned on 
appeal. He is awaiting a new trial.

'DON'T WANT TO LOOK BAD,' EXPERT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS SAID TO DENY SKINHEADS AS PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County school officials still deny their campuses are plagued by growing 
skinhead activity despite a report issued last year indicating there are at 
least 100 skinheads locally who are loosely organized in about six gangs, 
experts told 250 educators at a symposium Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a reluctance; school board members and others don't want to look bad," 
said Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I think schools have a paranoia of being labeled as a gang school, a drug 
school. . . . But when you identify the problem, you're dealing with that 
problem and that's good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, along with the Anti-Defamation League and the Orange County 
Department of Education, sponsored the 3-hour symposium to help school 
officials identify skinheads and to discuss what role educators can play in 
stopping the phenomenon that they classify as a form of gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
Experts who spoke at the symposium in Costa Mesa said the number of skinheads 
is difficult to determine. But the Anti-Defamation League, in a report released 
in October, says there are about 50 skinheads in Orange County "who preach 
violence against blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and homosexuals." The report 
says there is an equal or greater number of the "non-racist variety" of 
skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all youths with shaved heads or closely cropped hair are neo-Nazis. 
Indeed, there are young people who call themselves 'skinheads' who are 
anti-racist, some of whom have actually been targeted for violence by neo-Nazi 
skinheads," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, skinheads have been involved in a number of violent incidents 
against ethnic minorities and other groups. Last month, for example, three 
skinheads were suspected of stabbing and robbing a student at Loara High School 
in Anaheim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, three young neo-Nazi skinheads from Huntington Beach 
received the maximum penalty in a "gay-bashing" attack on a man in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cross Burning 
</P>
<P>
Neo-Nazi or skinhead youths were suspected of burning a cross on the lawn of a 
black family in Westminster last July 28 because of white supremacist graffiti 
found on neighborhood walls. A neighbor, Gary A. Skillman, 24, of Westminster, 
was convicted Jan. 4 of violating federal civil rights laws in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Rosenthal, western states counsel for the ADL, said that based on police 
reports and telephone calls to her organization, the ADL believes that 
membership in skinhead organizations continues to grow nationwide as well as in 
Orange County. Many incidents of violence by skinheads go unreported, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten some complaints in Orange County and Los Angeles from parents who 
say their kids have been accosted by skinheads," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fleager, a county probation officer who has become a specialist in dealing 
with white hate gangs, said Orange County's growing and changing population is 
a big factor in their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"The physical environment of Orange County is changing," he said. "For many 
people, the situation is, 'I'm not able to move out of an undesirable 
neighborhood because I can't afford a house in a desirable neighborhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shaved Heads 
</P>
<P>
Fleager said skinheads are often discernible by their shaved heads or short 
hair; tattoos, sometimes of swastikas; military flight jackets; pants rolled 
above boots, usually combat boots, and suspenders. 
</P>
<P>
Skinheads come from all socioeconomic groups, the educators were told, but one 
common denominator is that their parents had poor parenting skills. Skinheads 
have initiation activities that involve beating up new members, and they war 
with non-racist skinheads and minority gangs. 
</P>
<P>
They possess weapons and might be involved in offenses such as armed robbery, 
assaults and drugs, Fleager said. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Frias, manager of the County Department of Education's Operation Safe 
Schools, said the only way to combat the skinhead problem and gangs in general 
is to form partnerships between school officials, including teachers and even 
head custodians, parents and law enforcement personnel. Unity will make it 
easier to find solutions to a problem that most schools would rather deny 
exists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to bring together a team so you can take the punches collectively," 
Frias said. Ten Orange County school districts have formed such partnerships, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Image 
</P>
<P>
The problem is broader than just stopping ongoing violence, he said. Educators 
and others who work with youths must try to find out why some are "seduced" by 
the image of belonging to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Some educators said they worry that students identify with gangs because they 
need to belong to something. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Mellem, a campus supervisor at Buena Park High School, said skinhead 
activity "does exist here. It is here." 
</P>
<P>
He said some students at his school sport special rings, boots or jackets that 
identify them as skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
Other youths imitate the dress and some behavior of gangs but may not be gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Youths must be made to understand the long-term consequences to them and their 
families of associating with gangs, Frias said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs are a group of persons that come together and engage in illegal 
activity," he said. "Our stand is that there are no good gangs, and we have to 
teach them the consequences of that label. 
</P>
<P>
"When is a gang member never a gang member? Never, not until his death."

PAST IS PROBED AS FUTURE LOOMS; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY HAS ITS DAY WHILE IRVINE COAST AWAITS BULLDOZERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIMBERLY L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While its future may hold resort hotels and designer homes with ocean vistas, 
life on the Irvine Coast thousands of years ago was anything but glamorous, 
according to local archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine living in a rock cave with nothing for warmth but a small fire and a 
bear skin. Imagine fishing for dinner in a stormy winter ocean and cooking the 
catch to serve with berries gathered by family members. 
</P>
<P>
Scenes such as these probably characterized life on the Irvine Coast about 
3,000 years ago, said Michael Macko, director of archeology for the Costa 
Mesa-based Keith Cos. 
</P>
<P>
Macko and a staff of 35 archeologists, field workers and students have been 
surveying the 9,234 acres of unincorporated Irvine Coast area where the Irvine 
Co. plans to develop 2,600 housing units, 3 hotels and 2 golf courses. There 
also will be a Sheriff's Department substation, a fire station, a library and a 
child-care facility in the area, an Irvine Co. spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. finally won approval from the County Board of Supervisors to 
develop the area between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach last year, after a 
compromise was reached in a battle of more than 20 years with environmental and 
community groups opposed to development. The company gained approval for the 
project after several plan changes, the last of which was designed to leave as 
much open space as possible in the county's only remaining undeveloped expanse 
of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$5-Million, 3-Year Project 
</P>
<P>
To meet the requirements of the project's environmental impact report, the 
Irvine Co. hired archeologists to study the area and ensure that much of the 
area's archeological information would be preserved for study after 
development, Macko said. The most interesting findings will be displayed at 
Irvine's Museum of Natural History. Others will be stored in the museum's 
warehouse for possible study by future archeologists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. plans to spend $5 million on the 3-year project, which Macko 
said he hopes will be "the most in-depth history of Orange County ever taken." 
</P>
<P>
While those in the field haven't yet discovered "Irvine Man," Macko said, some 
of their finds are estimated to be as many as 5,000 years old. Among the items 
on display in a special showing Thursday were primitive tools, arrowheads and 
spearheads, and crude beads. Radiocarbon dating was used to determine the age 
of the artifacts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see at this time period is a very accomplished people," Macko said of 
those who must have used the artifacts. Though archeologists believe that they 
were nomadic, studies of the artifacts that surrounded their dwellings indicate 
that they were also sophisticated mariners and hunters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of two humans, believed to be of early Indian tribes that inhabited 
the area more than 800 years ago, also were found, Macko said. They were moved 
to an undisclosed burial area at the recommendation of an Indian consultant, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Macko said, there are 90 archeological sites on the Irvine Coast; of 
those, 67 are being preserved by the state as wildlife reserves or park areas. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 23 sites are being studied by archeologists, and since the 
project began in March of last year, they have excavated nine of the sites. 
Within the next year, they will complete the remaining sites, and the final 
year will be used to study their findings, Macko said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Aids Search 
</P>
<P>
From an on-site field office, Macko is refining a computer-assisted technique 
that enables him to project which of the sites will contain the most material 
of archeological importance. By surveying predetermined amounts of surface soil 
from several areas on a site and entering findings into a computer, Macko said 
he has been successful in determining which areas will contain the richest 
deposits of archeological information. 
</P>
<P>
Employees also work from the office to label and catalogue excavation findings, 
Macko said. 
</P>
<P>
And while their work would not compare to the elaborate Lascaux cave paintings 
in Southern France, the people who inhabited the miles of hilly coastal area 
between today's Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach did dabble in the arts, 
archeologists said. 
</P>
<P>
Assorted shapes and sizes of stones that were on display at the museum Thursday 
were decorated with indecipherable etchings. Archeologists said they believe 
that these were attempts at art by the early coastal dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not considered unique or priceless in their own right," Macko said. 
"But they are valuable historically."

LAGUNA HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
MARCH 30 IS DEADLINE FOR CANDIDATES TO FILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the proposed city of Laguna Hills have until March 30 to file 
petitions to run as City Council candidates when the cityhood issue goes before 
voters June 6. 
</P>
<P>
Council members will run for election at the same time voters consider the 
proposed incorporation of Laguna Hills. Those interested in one of the five 
council seats must obtain nominating petitions from the county registrar of 
voters and return it with at least 20 signatures of registered voters in that 
area by March 30. 
</P>
<P>
As for the matter of incorporation itself, the last day to file ballot 
arguments for or against it is March 20 at the registrar of voters office, 
1300-C S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana. Any registered voter or citizens' group 
entitled to vote on the measure may submit a ballot argument of 300 or fewer 
words. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, Laguna Hills, wedged between Interstate 5 on the east and the 
Aliso Viejo planned community on the west, would become the county's 29th city. 
It would have about 45,000 residents on 6,000 acres. The private Leisure World 
community of 21,000 people would form the geographic core of the new city.

 CITY APPEALS TO DROP KAYSER FROM BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an ongoing battle with City Council candidate Bennett Kayser, the city of 
Los Angeles has gone to court in an effort to remove his name from the April 11 
municipal primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Anthony Saul Alperin on Thursday asked the state Court of 
Appeal to throw out a Superior Court ruling last week requiring the city to add 
Kayser's name to the ballot. Alperin asked the appellate court to rule on the 
matter as quickly as possible, but he said no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Kayser, one of four candidates challenging Hollywood-area Councilman Michael 
Woo, failed to qualify for the ballot in February because the city clerk's 
office said he did not collect enough valid signatures. Kayser claimed that 
about 100 signatures had been improperly rejected, challenged the city clerk's 
ruling in Superior Court and won. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the Superior Court order, the city clerk's office has printed sample 
ballots and ballot pages for the 13th District with Kayser's name. The sample 
ballots are scheduled to be mailed to voters on Tuesday. A spokesman for the 
clerk's office said it would cost $9,100 to reprint the materials if the Court 
of Appeal rules in the city's favor.

COSTA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG SUSPECT ARRESTED IN REVERSE STING; 2 SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual reverse sting operation, a Los Angeles man was arrested as he 
allegedly attempted to buy 2 kilograms of cocaine from Costa Mesa undercover 
officers, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
David Frederick Wolfson, 28, was arrested about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday outside a 
restaurant at 3046 Bristol St. in Costa Mesa, where he allegedly had agreed to 
buy the cocaine for $20,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest was the culmination of a 2-month investigation of an ostensible 
cocaine ring said to have been operating in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach, said 
Sgt. Tom Boylan, narcotics investigator with the Costa Mesa Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police have issued arrest warrants for two other men suspected of having been 
involved in the ring, Boylan said. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Tom Venetis, 28, of Newport Beach, allegedly set up Wednesday's 
transaction but failed to appear. Police say Venetis is also wanted for 
possession of 1 1/2 pounds of cocaine that a Boy Scout troop found in January 
stashed in a suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
The troop found the suitcase on a nature hike in Newport Beach. The boy's 
scoutmaster discovered the cocaine and alerted authorities. Venetis is still at 
large, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The other man, Stavros I. Kalas, 28 of Newport Beach, was arrested in January 
in an alleged attempt to sell 4 ounces of cocaine, valued at about $20,000, to 
undercover officers. Kalas was released on bail and has left the country, 
Boylan said. He is believed to be in Australia, Boylan said. Kalas is now 
wanted for jumping bail and in connection with the alleged attempted cocaine 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe Venetis and Kalas were partners in the drug ring and that 
Venetis, frightened when Kalas was arrested, hid the cocaine in the suitcase, 
Boylan said.

 BROWN CREATES PANEL ON REFINERY HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has created an eight-member select committee of 
legislators to recommend how to protect workers and surrounding communities 
from dangers posed by oil refineries, chemical plants and pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which Brown announced Thursday, has a mandate to examine safety 
problems statewide, but Assemblyman David Elder (D-Long Beach), who will be its 
chairman, said the panel initially will focus on the South Bay. The heavily 
populated area has eight major refineries, one of the heaviest concentrations 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Elder added that he hopes to begin holding hearings before the summer recess. 
The committee is to turn in recommendations by July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Among recent events that spurred Elder to ask Brown to create the panel were 
accidents at the Mobil oil refinery in Torrance that caused three deaths and a 
dozen injuries in the last two years; chlorine clouds that forced the 
evacuations of thousands in Commerce and Simi Valley, and pipeline ruptures in 
the San Fernando Valley that poured thousands of gallons of crude oil onto 
streets.

SALE OF LIQUOR IS BARRED NEAR DANA SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to curb students' access to alcohol, the Dana Point City Council 
has passed an ordinance blocking a liquor license for a convenience store being 
built near Dana Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance approved unanimously Tuesday night prohibits the sale of 
alcoholic beverages within 500 feet of parks, schools and churches, and within 
100 feet of residences. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which took effect Wednesday, bars a Circle K convenience store from 
obtaining a license to sell beer and wine from the state Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Won't Have to React Again' 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have an ordinance that will affect any new business that would come in, 
so we won't have to react to it again," Dana Point City Councilman Mike Eggers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a representative for the store said he believes that the ordinance 
comes too late to affect their status. If the ordinance does cover Circle K, he 
said, an appeal may be considered. 
</P>
<P>
The council contended that the store would pose many problems if allowed to 
sell alcohol. The store, scheduled to open June 1, is in the Village shopping 
area at Street of the Golden Lantern and Acapulco Drive, near the high school. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids face enough problems in school, so they don't need any additional 
enticement from a store that sells alcohol nearby," Eggers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initial Agreement 
</P>
<P>
City and school officials and nearby residents initially made an agreement with 
the franchise's first owners that the Circle K store would sell no alcohol. 
However, the store's new owner -- unaware of the initial agreement -- requested 
an application from the ABC. 
</P>
<P>
A notice of the application, posted March 1, angered school board members and 
residents from the Marinita Townhomes and the Dana Woods Community Assn., all 
of whom wrote letters to the city and the ABC protesting the application. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, (we have) fought any liquor sale occurring across the street 
from the high school," said Dana Hills High's vice principal, William Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the store could become a "hangout" for students as well as 
"non-students who might harass our students. And we can't control that." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the two community associations addressed the council 
Tuesday night and presented petitions against the store's license. 
</P>
<P>
No one spoke in favor of the store; representatives from Circle K were not 
present, City Manager William O. Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Circle K Says Too Late 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Nye, real estate manager of the western region for Circle K Convenience 
Stores Inc., said that he was unaware of the council's decision but that he 
does not believe it will affect the store. 
</P>
<P>
"We applied for the ABC license and made arrangements for the liquor section 
before the city's zoning action," he said, "so I don't understand how this will 
change anything." 
</P>
<P>
Nye said the company would have to look into the matter further, and, if 
necessary, would appeal the zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that an appeal will even be necessary," he said, "but we need to 
get all the information first. . . . We put a lot of money into the store."

REOPENING OF HISTORIC RED CAR STATION AS MUSEUM AND DWP OFFICE SEEN AS SYMBOL 
OF HOPE, RENEWAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty-five years after it was constructed, the once-deteriorating Watts train 
station was reborn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people gathered at 103rd Street and Grandee Avenue to celebrate 
the grand reopening of the wood-frame structure, which will operate as a 
Department of Water and Power customer service office and a mini-museum of 
Watts history. 
</P>
<P>
Although the station will no longer serve as a passenger platform or ticket 
booth, city officials and Watts residents hope that the newly restored national 
historic landmark will serve as a symbol of continuity, hope and renewal for a 
neighborhood that has seen more than its share of hard times. 
</P>
<P>
The station, once a main junction for the city's famed Red Cars, is located 
about 90 feet from the Los Angeles-to-Long Beach light-rail line that is 
scheduled to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A New Era' 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than an historical occasion -- it is a magical occasion," said the 
Rev. Thomas Kilgore, a Community Redevelopment Agency commissioner. "If you 
listen closely, you can almost hear the rumbling of the Red Cars. The railroad 
served as a catalyst for staking a community here . . . and this will herald a 
new era for Watts." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley waxed nostalgic about the days five decades ago when he 
boarded the train at the Watts station, sometimes sneaking on without the 
15-cent fare. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are going to be able to relive those days when we rode the old Red 
Cars -- some of us free," he said to loud laughter. "I won't expose you; the 
statute of limitations has run out, so you can fully confess it to your 
next-door neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were great days. Those days of glory are going to return, and we are 
going to be at the heart of the action right here at the Watts train station," 
the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, at a reception at which croissants and kiwis were served, 
Bradley explained that he was not advocating that riders sneak onto the new 
train without paying. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, there were some of us who didn't have the 15 cents to ride the 
Red Car," he said. "I think that those who need to travel from their work to 
their home (these days) will be able to afford the fare." 
</P>
<P>
The brown, single-story station, restored to its original exterior design by 
the CRA for $700,000, was built in an era when farmers harvested cabbage down 
the block and the ethnically mixed neighborhood was known as a place where a 
working man could buy a home for $1 down and $1 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty years later, the train station was the only structure that remained 
intact when stores along 103rd Street burned during the Watts riots. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, a shopping center, a health center and 458 units of 
affordable housing have been constructed in the neighborhood with the 
assistance of $32 million in redevelopment funds. But the historic station has 
been largely vacant and run down since the demise of the Red Cars, the electric 
rail system that carried commuters and tourists around the Los Angeles Basin 
until it was taken out of service almost 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's ceremony, city officials paid tribute to 70-year Watts resident 
Freita Shaw Johnson, who spearheaded a two-decade community effort to restore 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a retired music director, said she hoped that the refurbished station 
and the adjacent transit line will lead to "economic growth and jobs and . . . 
give a better picture of our area." 
</P>
<P>
Officials, who also called the rail line a stimulus for commerce, stressed 
during the ceremony that the gated complex that will contain the old station, a 
new light-rail platform and parking will be brightly lit and monitored by 
closed-circuit cameras to provide safety for rail riders. 
</P>
<P>
However, several area residents interviewed Thursday cautioned that 24-hour 
security service will be necessary to avert problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If they get enough security it might work," said Angelo Machicote, 22. "But 
just like security has guns, the gang-bangers have guns."

POLICE REPORT NO LEADS IN DEATH OF RESTAURANT WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Suspects and a motive are still lacking in the death of restaurant worker Peter 
Espejo Castro, who was fatally shot while walking in the Lido Peninsula area of 
Newport Beach, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, 47, lived in a mobile home park at 47 Cabrillo St., near the shooting 
scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
He was shot once in the chest about 1 a.m. Wednesday as he was walking to his 
parked car in the 3000 block of Lafayette Avenue, near the Cannery Restaurant. 
Witnesses told police that Castro was stopped by two men in a blue Toyota 
pickup truck that was driven down Lafayette, from 31st Street, the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
As the driver of the truck waited, a male passenger got out, talked briefly 
with Castro, then shot him once in the chest. The truck then roared off, 
witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
Castro worked at Delaney's Restaurant, 630 Lido Park Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very good employee who always reported to work on time and performed 
well," said Dan Silva, vice president of Delaney's Inc. "He was a very quiet, 
private person, so we don't know much about him. But he was a very diligent 
employee." 
</P>
<P>
Silva said co-workers knew of no reason anyone would want to gun down Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Bob Oakely, spokesman for the Newport Beach Police Department, said 
Thursday that no new information has turned up in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know of a motive," Oakley said. "From what we've learned about the 
man, he was a very private person." Oakley said Castro was living alone in the 
mobile home park.

A WARMER WEEKEND IS ON THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Possible overnight drizzles should be gone from Southern California by this 
morning, the forecasters say, giving way to wind and to warmer weather that 
should be even better by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Today's west-to-northwest winds, expected to gust to about 20 m.p.h., "ought to 
die down" tonight and shouldn't be too much of a problem after that, said 
meteorologist Pat Cooper of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be very cool in Orange County because you will be having that wind 
coming in off the ocean during the day, keeping temperatures in the upper 50s 
to mid-60s Friday," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
With a large low-pressure system to the north continuing to move inland and a 
high-pressure ridge building up off Baja California, Southland temperatures are 
expected to rise from today's cloudy mid-60s to low 70s on Saturday and 
slightly warmer on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the weekend's warming trend should bring temperatures back into the 
70s and possibly the 80s by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a pretty nice weekend for the county," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold front that brushed the Southland on Thursday brought winds whipping up 
to more than 30 m.p.h. in the Antelope Valley. Edwards Air Force Base had 
southwest gusts of 37 m.p.h. and parts of the Owens Valley had gusts of more 
than 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Stiff winds also hit the deserts of San Diego County and Kern County. Motorists 
with high-profile vehicles were warned to be careful driving around the Mojave 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said Thursday's high temperature at Santa Ana was 
68 degrees. The low was 50. Relative humidity was 69%. 
</P>
<P>
The storm front dumped heavy rain on Northern California, snow and strong winds 
in the Sierra Nevada and high winds in Nevada.

TRABUCO HILLS' WULF MAKING SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM A SURE-SHOT PLAYER TO A 
HOT-SHOT COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rainer Wulf, boys' basketball coach at Trabuco Hills High School, had played 
the game for so long that he never thought about coaching it. This was a game 
he played, not one he analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
He spent hours as a youngster shooting in a tiny recreation gym in Monterey 
Park, often staying until the lights were finally turned out at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled throughout Southern California playing for a youth all-star team, 
winning 162 games in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He earned All-Southern Section honors at Bishop Amat High School, was a 
two-year starter at Citrus College and was among Bill Mulligan's first 
recruiting class at UC Irvine in 1980-81. He was Irvine's captain the next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Once his college career was over, Wulf played professionally in Australia for a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I played for so long, it was all I ever did," Wulf said. "Heck, I never 
thought about coaching. I never thought about skiing or anything else except 
playing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Wulf, 29, is now coaching with equal success the game he played so well. 
Wulf will lead Trabuco Hills into the state Division III boys' championship 
game against Central Valley at 12:45 p.m. Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wulf was unable to foresee his transition from player to coach, many 
of those who have followed his career figured all along that he was destined 
for the seat at the end of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bokosky saw the signs during Wulf's two seasons at UC Irvine. Bokosky and 
Wulf arrived at Irvine the same season, Bokosky as Mulligan's top assistant and 
Wulf among six junior college transfers recruited by Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
The two became best friends and lived together for seven years until Wulf 
recently bought a condominium in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always so well organized and very diligent," Bokosky said. "Whether he 
realized it or not at the time, he was exposed to some great coaches like Boyd 
Grant and Jerry Tarkanian. Rainer was very well-rounded when he graduated from 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Russ Boenker, one of Wulf's first coaches and now one of his assistants at 
Trabuco Hills, first saw him and his friend, Alex Acosta, in elementary school. 
He invited them to play for his traveling team, the Monterey Park Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two played football, basketball and baseball and never lost," Boenker 
said. "They always played a grade or two up. When they were in the third grade, 
they were playing on fifth-grade teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew Rainer was going to be successful at anything he did. He has a 
great family background and is an intelligent guy who has the ability to use 
his smarts." 
</P>
<P>
But Boenker, who owns a dry cleaners and delicatessen in Tustin, says he never 
imagined the current coaching scenario. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one I never saw down the road," he said. "I always envisioned Rainer as 
a college player and someday a coach, but I never thought I would be assisting 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf's introduction to coaching came as a graduate assistant under Mulligan in 
1983. He said it was at that time that he started thinking about a coaching 
career. He spend a second season with Mulligan, then signed on as an assistant 
to Steve Scoggins at University High for the 1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
But he wasn't quite ready to call it a career as a player. Wulf signed with a 
team in Lithgon, Australia, for $1,500 a month and developed into one of the 
league's top players, averaging 29 points and 13 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great situation with one season ending and the other starting," Wulf 
said. "I had a lot of fun and the people were great to me in Australia." 
</P>
<P>
But after a season in Australia, Wulf knew he wanted to coach. He applied for 
the varsity position at San Clemente in June of '86 but ended up the second 
choice. The same thing happened at Irvine in May of '87. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't discouraged," he said. "The interviews were a learning process. The 
second one at Irvine was a piece of cake. . . . Everything went great, but they 
were really impressed with Steve Keith." 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Wulf went to a coaching clinic in Las Vegas. When he returned a few 
days later, he learned of an opening at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing was almost perfect," he said. "It was my job." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf inherited a program in its third season on a campus with three permanent 
buildings -- administration, science and gymnasium. Wulf and Trabuco Hills 
would quietly grow together. 
</P>
<P>
No one envisioned a school in only its fourth year of existence with a 
second-year coach qualifying for a state championship game. At one point last 
December, Wulf had his doubts after consecutive losses in the Canyon 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the low point of the season," he said. "We had a team meeting, and I 
told the players we have a guy (center Rick Swanwick) shooting 60% and taking 
only 12 shots. We've got others shooting under 45% taking as many shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to convince the guards that if they threw the ball inside to Rick more, 
they would score more. Rick had become a victim of his previous seasons. It 
took the others a while to believe that Rick had really improved, that he was a 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf said during the course of the meeting that he flashed back to his playing 
days at UC Irvine and a similar team meeting under Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
"Mulligan told us to get the ball to (center Kevin) Magee or we would sit," 
Wulf said. "I told my team basically the same thing, although I didn't use the 
exact same language." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills responded by winning 21 of its past 22 games, and Wulf is now 
being heralded as one of the top young coaches in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Boenker credits Wulf's organizational skills and preparation in Trabuco Hills' 
championship season. Bokosky says Wulf's ability to get the maximum from his 
players and their trademark of playing hard with intelligence has been 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, his longtime friend for 24 years and now coaching at Bishop Amat, looks 
back at his youthful days with Wulf and never doubted they would be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew we would be OK," he said. "I got the greatest feeling watching 
Russ and him in the Sports Arena. He came to all my playoff games last year, 
and I know he felt the same way."

PROSPERO WILL BE NAMED ASSISTANT COACH AT CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Prospero will remain at Chapman College as an assistant basketball coach, 
a source in the athletic department said Thursday. School officials are 
expected to make the announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
Prospero, 25, was the Panthers' interim coach last season. He and Jerry DeBusk 
will assist new Chapman coach Bob Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd met with Prospero on Wednesday to discuss the possibility of Prospero 
remaining with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Prospero will be the team's top assistant coach and will handle some of the 
recruiting, according to a source. He was an assistant at Chapman for two years 
before replacing Kevin Wilson, who was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Chapman, Prospero coached four years at Tustin High School as 
a varsity assistant and lower-level coach. 
</P>
<P>
Prospero's contract is expected to be in excess of $30,000 per year. Besides 
coaching, he also will teach at least one class. 
</P>
<P>
DeBusk, who coached at Newport Harbor High School last season, accepted the 
Chapman job Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prospero also was a candidate for the job as head coach. He was one of five 
candidates interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Under Prospero, the Panthers finished 17-12 and were third in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. Chapman had a successful season despite some 
off-court distractions. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Wilson resigned effective at the end of the season. He was fired 
seven weeks later for his published comments regarding the distribution of 
funds at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Strothers was named interim coach. However, after the team threatened 
to boycott, Prospero became the interim coach.

SNOW REALLY GETS LONG BEACH ROLLING FROM THE START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gary Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it the Snow-ball effect. 
</P>
<P>
Few people in the college baseball community doubted that Dave Snow would 
improve the Cal State Long Beach baseball program when he left Loyola Marymount 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, including Snow, believed the transformation would occur so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, which was 15-45 last season under former Coach John Gonsalves, is 
22-3 and ranked fourth and sixth, respectively, in this week's Collegiate 
Baseball-ESPN and Baseball America polls. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' only losses came against Arizona State (twice) and Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone beyond even my expectations," Snow said. "But anytime you play, 
you've got an opportunity and, basically, we've just capitalized." 
</P>
<P>
Snow, 38, has a history of engineering turnarounds. 
</P>
<P>
After playing for Augie Garrido at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and serving as an 
assistant under Garrido at Cal State Fullerton from 1973-77, Snow took over a 
beleaguered program at Valley College in 1978 and won four Metropolitan 
Conference titles and a state community college championship in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Snow returned to Fullerton as an assistant in 1983, then replaced Marv Wood at 
Loyola in the summer of 1984 after the Lions endured an 11-41 season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Snow led Loyola to a 50-15 record, a share of the West Coast Athletic 
Conference title and into the College World Series. Last season, Loyola was 
48-18, losing to Oklahoma State in the Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the experiences I've had at other places, I had a pretty good game 
plan when I came in here," said Snow, who compiled a 161-81-1 record in four 
seasons at Loyola. "I'm just fortunate that in June there were still some 
pretty good players out there." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Abbott, a junior left-hander who played at Mission Viejo High and 
transferred to Long Beach from UC San Diego, is 7-0 with a 1.82 earned-run 
average and has 45 strikeouts in 50 innings. Abbott leads a staff that has 
compiled a 2.59 ERA under pitching coach Wally Kincaid, who retired as a head 
coach in 1980 with a record of 675-162 in 22 seasons at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Darrell Sherman, a junior transfer from Cerritos, is batting 
.425 with one home run, 20 runs batted in and 14 stolen bases. Deryk Hudson, a 
junior third baseman-designated hitter from Fullerton College, is batting .292 
with a team leading five home runs and 29 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are also getting production from returning players such as senior 
second baseman Chris Gill, who is batting .387 with one home run and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, they've been a pretty hungry group," Snow said of his players. "They 
wanted to put this place on the map." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach does not open play in the Big West Conference until March 31 but 
there will be no surprise element going for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got an identity now," Snow said. "They're going to be loaded up and 
ready for us." 
</P>
<P>
A cut above: USC pitcher Randy Powers almost lost part of the ring finger on 
his right hand in a construction accident last summer. But Powers, a junior 
right-hander from Azusa, doesn't seem to have lost his control. 
</P>
<P>
Powers allowed three hits, had seven strikeouts and did not walk a batter in 
shutting out UCLA, 6-0, last Friday night in a Pacific 10 Southern Division 
game. The victory improved Powers' record to 5-0 and lowered his ERA to 2.15. 
He has issued seven walks in 50 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"The finger feels fine and looks fine on the bottom," said Powers, who won his 
first seven starts last season before tearing a muscle in his elbow and 
finishing 11-5. "But on top, where the fingernail is, it looks pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
Powers, who does not have a full scholarship, was loading metal brackets onto a 
truck last August when a glove he was wearing caught on a nail and a brace fell 
on his finger. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing holding (the finger) on was the nerve, which stretched more 
than an inch," Powers said. "It was more numb than anything else. I didn't 
think about losing the finger until a doctor said that was a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Powers underwent 2 1/2 hours of surgery to repair the damage and a wire pin was 
inserted in his knuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"I took 15 painkillers a day for the first few days," he said. "It's amazing 
how one little part of your body can cause so much pain to the rest of it." 
</P>
<P>
Powers will start today in the opener of a three-game conference series at 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
For openers: Pepperdine and Loyola, playing under first-year coaches Andy Lopez 
and Chris Smith, respectively, will open their WCAC schedules today. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, the defending WCAC champion, travels to Santa Clara for a four-game 
series and Loyola, which finished fourth in the WCAC last season, travels to 
the University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez won two California Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles in six seasons at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills before replacing Dave Gorrie, who retired after winning 
or sharing five conference titles in 10 years at Pepperdine. 
</P>

LORENZO IS FOCUS OF LATEST TACTICS IN EASTERN STRIKE

Supporters of striking Eastern Airlines machinists launched the latest phase of 
their campaign against airline executive Frank Lorenzo here Thursday, but the 
initiative aimed at Lorenzo's Continental Airlines appeared to have little 
immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Jane Barry, president of Eastern's flight attendants' union, flew here 
from Miami to start what she called a "Stand Up to Lorenzo, America" campaign. 
Lorenzo is the chairman of Texas Air, the holding company that owns both 
Eastern and Continental Airlines, and is considered one of organized labor's 
arch-enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the 1930s, labor supporters invented a tactic which swept the country 
and unionized the auto, steel, electrical and rubber industries," Barry said, 
speaking at a rally outside the Continental terminal at Denver's Stapleton 
International Airport. "This tactic was called the 'sit-down' -- the tactic of 
the '30s." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, she said, unionists were launching a new tactic, called the 
"stand-up" to try to persuade passengers not to fly Continental and to impede 
Continental's airport counter operations and other elements of its reservation 
process. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists struck Eastern on March 4 after a long dispute over Eastern's 
demand that the union agree to accept reduced wages and benefits. The airline 
says it cannot afford to keep paying the workers at their current rates. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists have rejected the demand and accuse Lorenzo of stripping 
unionized Eastern of valuable assets and transferring them to non-union 
Continental. Both airlines are losing money, and late last week Eastern filed 
for protection from creditors while it reorganizes under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's boisterous rally, attended by about 500 people, about 75 to 
100 of them walked into the airport and strode to Continental ticket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Camacho, a member of the Communications Workers of America, was the 
first to reach a Continental counter. First, he told a ticket agent that he 
spoke no English. Then, when a Spanish-speaking Continental employee appeared, 
Camacho asked how he could fly to Bogota, Colombia, and engaged the ticket 
agent in a long conversation about the trip. Finally, he was sent to 
Continental's international counter. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, another member of the Communications Workers asked how she 
could get to Johnson City, Pa. She was told that Continental did not fly there 
and that she would have to go to Newark, N.J. She walked away without buying a 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
After several other protesters asked about making trips to out-of-the-way 
cities, Continental supervisor Michael J. Brzostowski started handing 
telephones to people he considered bogus customers and suggested that they make 
their reservations by phone. 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, Lyle May, a 39-year-old union printer, walked up to one of 
Continental's eight counters and asked if he could "buy a one-way ticket out of 
the country for Frank Lorenzo." 
</P>
<P>
The ticket clerk responded tartly: "Not on this airline." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Belkin, one of the rally organizers, said the tactics, and perhaps others, 
would be used in coming weeks against Continental in Houston, Los Angeles, 
Newark and perhaps other places. 
</P>
<P>
But Continental clearly was prepared for Thursday's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected Arrests 
</P>
<P>
The airline had a number of security personnel outside and inside the airport, 
equipped with walkie-talkies and cellular telephones. In addition, about two 
dozen Denver police officers stationed themselves at the terminal, and a paddy 
wagon was present. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Thursday's rally organizers thought it was possible that there would be 
arrests and had made arrangements for a bail bondsman to be ready to help. But 
there were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments Thursday, Miami-based Eastern told its remaining 1,500 
non-union workers that they will have to put in up to 60 hours of work a week 
without overtime pay and periodically take time off -- usually a week at a time 
-- without pay. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman James Ashlock, quoted by Associated Press, also said the 
employees will share new jobs, such as housekeeping functions. Some of the 
machinists' union members worked as janitors. 
</P>
<P>
Before the strike and bankruptcy filing, Eastern had about 30,000 employees and 
flew 1,040 flights a day. It is now flying about 100 daily flights, most of 
them on its New York-Washington and New York-Boston shuttle routes.

Seagram Co.: The Montreal-based producer and marketer of distilled spirits, 
wines, coolers and juices said 1988 profit rose 13.1% to $589.5 million from a 
year ago. Sales increased 32.5% to $5.1 billion, an improvement the company 
attributed to the additions of Tropicana and Martell as well as to significant 
growth in its international business. Seagram said the increase in net earnings 
reflected the strength of its beverage business and the particularly good 
results reported by Du Pont. At year-end, Seagram held a 22.9% interest in Du 
Pont.

FEDERAL REGULATORS SEIZE 47 MORE AILING S&amp;LS

Federal regulators Thursday announced the takeover of 47 more failed savings 
and loan institutions, while President Bush urged Congress to act more swiftly 
on his rescue plan for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The takeovers bring the number of institutions under the control of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. to 165 in 25 states. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest action, the agency took over 16 institutions in Texas, 10 in 
Illinois, nine each in Louisiana and Florida and three in Oklahoma. Their 
assets totaled $6.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC, which regulates commercial banks, is going into the sickest S&amp;Ls 
with the goal of minimizing losses while the Administration waits for Congress 
to appropriate the money to shut them down or sell them to new buyers. The 
agency plans to take over about 60 more institutions within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile President Bush, in a speech in Houston, prodded Congress to move 
quickly on his plan to save the beleaguered industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no excuse for delay," he said, urging legislators to meet his 
challenge to pass the reform package 45 days from Feb. 22, when it was 
delivered to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Donald W. Riegle (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, 
announced Thursday that his committee plans to act on an S&amp;L bill by April 
14 and is pressing for a full Senate vote by April 21, which is after the 
45-day deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going as fast as we can within the bounds of doing the job properly," 
Riegle said. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, the subcommittee with jurisdiction over S&amp;Ls plans a vote by 
April 14, with a vote by the full Banking Committee to follow soon after. 
However, nearly a half dozen other House committees are claiming jurisdiction 
over part of the bill and that may delay a vote by the full House. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
* Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, 
said he will push to strip from the Bush S&amp;L proposal a provision for the 
automatic reappointment of M. Danny Wall as the nation's top S&amp;L regulator. 
</P>
<P>
* The Senate Finance Committee endorsed the nomination of David W. Mullins Jr., 
one of the architects of the Administration's S&amp;L plan, to a senior 
Treasury Department post. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), said the full 
Senate could confirm Mullins as assistant secretary for domestic finance as 
early as today. 
</P>
<P>
* A report of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, summarized in a House Banking 
Committee memo, cited five examples where S&amp;L regulators in Dallas may have 
given preferential treatment to influential members of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
* Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) complained in a letter to Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady about efforts by S&amp;L regulators to sell repossessed 
property in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
* State bank and S&amp;L regulators asked Congress to preserve their power to 
permit state-chartered institutions to offer services and make investments not 
allowed federal-chartered S&amp;Ls.

National Semiconductor Corp.: The Santa Clara, Calif.-based computer chip 
maker, which has shed one division, agreed to sell another and laid off 2,000 
workers to stem losses, said it had a net loss of $44.6 million in the third 
quarter, contrasted with a $15.2-million profit a year before. Revenue rose 3% 
to $589 million from a year earlier. The company said its chip business was 
hurt by a decline in bookings in late 1988 caused by a buildup of inventory, a 
slowdown in computer sales and seasonal factors.

MANISCHEWITZ TO BE SOLD FOR $40.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
B. Manischewitz Co., a leading matzo maker, has agreed to be acquired by the 
Los Angeles investment firm of Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur E. Levine said Thursday that his firm agreed to pay $40.5 million, or 
$762.75 a share, for the Jersey City, N.J., company. Besides matzot, the firm 
produces other kosher baked goods and soups, and licenses its name to a wine 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
Levine's firm was among 45 bidders for the company, which said it first 
solicited offers last fall to increase shareholder value. Levine, Tessler, 
Leichtman made its bid with five members of Manischewitz management, including 
President and Chief Executive Robert M. Starr. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said the purchase would be financed from borrowings and some of the 
firm's own funds. He said he has obtained a commitment from Drexel Burnham 
Lambert for the debt financing, but he declined to provide details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Low-Ball Deal' 
</P>
<P>
But one Manischewitz shareholder said Thursday that he isn't happy with the 
deal, and said he might make his own bid. J. Morton Davis, who acquired 5.67% 
of the firm last March for $750 a share, called the $40.5-million selling price 
"a low-ball deal." 
</P>
<P>
He said that for the past six months, the thinly traded stock has ranged 
between $800 and $1,000 a share on the Cincinnati Stock Exchange. He said that 
in the past, he offered to buy the shares held by members of the Manischewitz 
board of directors but was rebuffed. Various directors control 27.3% of 
Manischewitz shares. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he asked Manischewitz's investment bankers, Shearson Lehman Hutton, 
if he could examine the company's books so he could make a bid for the firm. 
But Davis said he declined to review the books after he was told he would have 
to sign an agreement barring him from buying Manischewitz stock for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked our lawyers to see if they can get us the books now," said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said his partnership, formed 18 months ago, doesn't plan any big changes 
at the firm.

FBI Seeks Funds: FBI Director William Sessions asked Congress for an additional 
$48 million over the next two years to expand investigations of fraud in banks 
and thrift associations. "these resources would permit the FBI to hire 236 new 
special agents and 218 new clerical and professional support employees, nearly 
half of whom would be accounting technicians," Sessions told a Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Federal bank and thrift regulators have 
testified that fraud is involved in many recent S&amp;L failures.

ITC Ruling: The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled 4-1 that Japanese 
firms were dumping microdisks on the U.S. market, paving the way for the 
Commerce Department to levy anti-dumping duties. The commission, which monitors 
compliance to U.S. trade law, ruled the imports sold at less than fair market 
value were injuring American firms making the disks that are widely used in 
portable computers. It acted on a complaint filed on behalf of the U.S. 
industry by Verbatim Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. Domestic manufacturers have long 
complained that the Japanese have violated U.S. trade rules. The disks are big 
sellers for use in the increasingly popular laptop or travel computers.

Trident Contract Awarded: Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., a division of 
Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp., has received a $921.6-million defense contract 
for submarine missiles, the Navy said. The money is to build new Trident II 
long-range nuclear missiles for America's strategic Trident submarines. The 
missile is also known as the D-5. Work on the contract is expected to be 
completed in September of 1991, the Navy said. Lockheed is one of the nation's 
largest defense contractors. The company last year had $3.53 billion worth of 
business in prime contracts with the Defense Department as its eighth-largest 
contractor.

FILM PRODUCERS MATHESON AND GRODNIK BUY CONTROL OF NATIONAL LAMPOON INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood film producers Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson walked into 
loss-riddled National Lampoon Inc. three months ago, talking softly but packing 
a 21% voting stake like an assault rifle. On Thursday, they took over its 
operation from founder Matty Simmons without firing a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The new management bought Simmons' nearly 10% stock holding in the New York 
magazine and film company for $761,400, to give them working control with about 
31%. 
</P>
<P>
Matheson, who played the role of Otter in the company's 1978 hit comedy "Animal 
House," and Grodnik took over as co-chairmen and co-chief executives. Simmons, 
62, who started the goofy National Lampoon humor magazine in 1970, resigned as 
an officer and director and began a new career as independent producer with a 
nonexclusive arrangement with National Lampoon. 
</P>
<P>
His first project -- as well as the new management's initial film -- will begin 
shooting March 27. It is "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation," the latest in 
a series starring Chevy Chase. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons is executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said he will stay in the firm's Culver City offices. Noting that he has 
been "running" between the office and the magazine's New York headquarters for 
10 years, Simmons said the deal was "exactly what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Filings by Grodnik and Matheson with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
gave a play-by-play account that showed them increasingly flexing their muscle. 
</P>
<P>
When they first met with Simmons in late December, they brought with them as an 
adviser David Batchelder, a former strategist for oil company raider T. Boone 
Pickens Jr. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Money Since 1982 
</P>
<P>
The group first asked for board representation and a role in National Lampoon's 
operations. After getting those, Grodnik and Matheson said they wanted to 
become co-presidents. In return, they pledged not to put up another slate of 
directors at the next shareholders meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But the confrontation never got to that stage, and the newcomers announced a 
month ago that they were in negotiations to buy out Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
National Lampoon, begun in 1967 as Twenty First Century Publishing, has lost 
money every year since 1982. The magazine has a circulation of about 250,000. 
Grodnik and Matheson have said they plan to recapitalize the firm, with the aid 
of Batchelder, a La Jolla investment banker, and to expand its film and 
publishing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Three other directors left the board with Simmons: his son Michael, George S. 
Agoglia and Howard Jurofsky. Alan S. Parsow, a Nebraska ally of Grodnik and 
Matheson, remained on the board. Grodnik and Matheson said they will add other 
directors in a few weeks.

Ask 2-year-old Jeffrey Gross what he wants to be when he grows up and he has a 
quick answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales manager," he'll say, as he scampers around a truck parked at Ideal Sales 
&amp; Distribution Co., his parents' truck accessories business in City of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey's father, Mark Gross, beams. Gross says he would like nothing better 
than for his son and 5-year-old daughter, Rachel, to follow him and his wife, 
Julie, into the family business. 
</P>
<P>
At 35, Mark Gross is president and owner of Ideal. Julie, 31, is vice president 
and works part time in the business they bought from Julie's father about eight 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Because they are already sharing their business experience with their children, 
the couple have an excellent chance of passing it along to them, according to 
Leon Danco, president of the Center for Family Business and a family business 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ensuring an Heir 
</P>
<P>
It is the business executives who are too busy to share their dreams with their 
children that end up with no heirs interested in stepping in when they retire, 
Danco said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the father takes time to make a partner of his wife, the kids will 
benefit," Danco said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every day, Danco says, a business owner nearing retirement age calls him 
for help, frantic because he has failed to interest his children in running his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a man offer me half a million dollars if I would just get his son 
interested in the business," Danco said. "If you hate your father's business, 
you hate it and there is nothing I can do to change it." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is important to try to pique your child's interest in a family 
business, Danco cautions against forcing or bribing an uninterested child. And 
it is important to accept that while some children have a natural aptitude for 
business and leadership, others will never be suited to a role in business. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a Mozart, don't try to turn him into a second-rate businessman," 
Danco advised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disdaining Nepotism 
</P>
<P>
Apart from failing to communicate their dreams, many family business founders, 
who have struggled for monetary success, are uncomfortable about just handing 
over their businesses to their children. Danco said the idea of giving a 
successful business to a child on a silver platter represents to some nepotism 
and the "modern day equivalency of divine birth." 
</P>
<P>
For a smoother transition, he suggested that business owners try to work with 
their children for a while before moving out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"When your children take over the business, it is a bit like becoming a 
grandfather and watching your children take care of the baby," Danco said. 
</P>
<P>
Even those founders who admit they are mortal and prepare for management 
succession often fail to push their children into jobs elsewhere so they can 
gain valuable experience before returning to the family company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The family business owner is usually not Harvard-educated," Danco said. "He 
teaches his kid tradesman's ethics instead of grooming a leader." 
</P>
<P>
But what happens when there are no heirs interested in running the family 
business? 
</P>
<P>
"If your children can't run it, sell it," Danco said. "Because if you let them 
own it, but not run it, the job of the outside professional is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Danco said today's family business owners have the option of grooming sons, 
daughters or both for business leadership. Julie Gross is a perfect example of 
a daughter who stepped in to run her family business after her father's death. 
</P>
<P>
Truck air conditioning and chrome bumpers may not be in every girl's dreams, 
but for Gross, the family business has been a perfect way to work with her 
father and now with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember coming down to work with my dad on a Saturday and playing with the 
trucks," Gross said. "I've built radiators. I started delivering parts when I 
got a driver's license." 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist, Mark Gross said he joined his wife's family business after 
his own father made it clear that there was little opportunity for him in the 
Gross family's hotel and restaurant supply business. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to succeed him, but he wouldn't leave," Mark said, with a smile. "I 
wanted to be sitting in his chair." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Mark sits in the president's chair at Ideal, which now employs 25 
people and posts millions in annual sales. Under his leadership, Ideal's 
product distribution has expanded across the country, and the company began 
manufacturing as well as importing products. 
</P>
<P>
But he and his wife admit that taking over a family business has not been easy. 
First they had to assure longtime employees that their jobs were secure. Then 
they faced having to change banks when the company's longtime banker refused to 
lend them money. Later they were hit with the bankruptcy of a major customer 
who owed them thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Now things have settled down to the point where they recently took a short 
vacation in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice feeling that we are building something together," Julie said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Family Business Seminars 
</P>
<P>
Family business owners inspired to solve a variety of problems may be 
interested in two upcoming seminars. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Danco is leading a seminar focusing on how to plan for management 
succession. The seminar, which attracts family business owners from across the 
country, is scheduled for June 14-16 in Cleveland. The cost is $1,195 for the 
first person and $1,095 for each additional member of the family or company.

Cleveland, Ohio 44124, or call (216) 442-0800. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Entrepreneurial Management in New York is sponsoring a three-day 
seminar on the family business experience May 4-6 in Cassopolis, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled topics include the role of the board of directors in a family 
business, estate planning, should the children work in a family firm and how 
husbands and wives can work as a team. For non-members, the fee is $1,600 for 
the first person, $1,000 for the second person and $800 for each additional 
person. For information on the seminar or to rent a one-hour videocassette

AMERICAN AIR NEAR $3-BILLION JET PURCHASE

<P>
Just five weeks after announcing a potential $7-billion, 150-plane purchase, 
American Airlines appeared to be on the verge Thursday of a $3.09-billion deal 
with Dutch manufacturer Fokker for up to 150 more planes. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the spending spree reflects American's financial strength and 
strategy for modernizing its fleet and expanding its routes. 
</P>
<P>
American announced Wednesday that it plans to spend $95 million to expand its 
corporate headquarters in Ft. Worth and is expected within the next few weeks 
to announce a location for a new $200-million maintenance facility to service 
its expanding fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which is the main business unit of AMR Corp., on Wednesday also 
distributed profit sharing of $121 million, or an average of $1,950 per 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
American spokesman Al Becker would not confirm the Fokker deal, but Fokker 
spokesman Bart van Veen said in Amsterdam: "We're discussing the final minor 
details." 
</P>
<P>
Van Veen said American had 75 firm orders for Fokker's 100-seat, F-100 
twin-engine jet, with another 75 "very firm" options, giving the package a 
total value of about $3.09 billion. 
</P>
<P>
American's order -- which has been under negotiation for five years -- would be 
considered a crucial breakthrough for Fokker into the U.S. aviation market. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is that we have had interest in Fokker airplanes along with 
others," Becker said. "We are just not in a position at this point to say 
anything more about the Fokker airplane." 
</P>
<P>
The F-100 is smaller than most domestic airplanes and is ideal for use on 
feeder routes of up to 1,100 nautical miles in a hub system. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, American announced an agreement with McDonnell Douglas Corp. to buy 
eight long-range MD-11 wide-body jetliners with options for 42 more. The 
airline also took options on 100 MD-80s, a smaller McDonnell plane designed to 
replace the Boeing 727. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimated the value of the deal at $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
American's fleet of 478 planes already is one of the youngest in the industry 
at an average age of about 9.4 years, and Becker said the carrier plans to 
reduce the average to about 8.4 years by 1992. He said the company's fleet 
would total more than 600 planes by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Donald J. Carty, the airline's vice president for planning and 
finance, said American would spend about $10.5 billion through the end of 1993 
to modernize its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said most of the new airplanes would be used to expand American's 
routes.

ECONOMIC NEWS PUSHES DOW UP 20.17 
</P>

<P>
From Times Wire Services

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market climbed Thursday, propelled by new evidence of a slackening in 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 20.17 to 2,340.71, its highest 
close since it stood at 2,343.21 on Feb. 8. The day before that the average hit 
a post-crash high of 2,347.14. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 196.04 million shares, up from 
167.07 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, the market is acting real well. But it was helped by a couple of huge 
buy programs," one trader said. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the day's computer-driven buying programs was related to the 
expiration of several major futures and options contracts, also know as "triple 
witching," market analysts said. "The move in share prices was exaggerated by 
the options," said Charles Jensen of MKI Securities. 
</P>
<P>
A complication for the immediate market outlook was the "triple witching hour" 
today, when the last trading occurs in a series of stock and index options and 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production was unchanged in 
February from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Cooling 
</P>
<P>
A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage points, to 
84.3%, in capacity utilization of the nation's production facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said those figures were read by some traders as evidence of an easing 
in the strains the economy has been exerting on inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
That provided some hope for signs of improvement in today's impending report on 
the producer price index for February. A 1% increase in the index during 
January unsettled both the stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's economic data followed Wednesday's U.S. merchandise trade report, 
which showed the deficit shrinking to $9.49 billion in January, a sharp drop 
from the prior month's $10.99 billion. The report boosted stocks and bonds. 
"The numbers this week helped relieve fears of an overheating economy," said 
market analyst Alfred Goldman of A. G. Edwards &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks of money-center banks were strong on word from the Bush Administration 
that its debt-reduction initiative could reduce Third World debt by about 20% 
over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Morgan rose 1 1/2 to 37 1/4; Citicorp was up 1 3/8 to 28 1/8; Chase 
Manhattan added 1/2 to 34 3/8, and Chemical Banking rose 1 1/8 to 32 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
USX gained 3/4 to 32 7/8. In its annual report, the company gave an upbeat 
assessment of its future. 
</P>
<P>
Pacificorp was actively traded, up 3/4 at 34 3/4. The stock was added to 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by funds set 
up to parallel the performance of the index. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indicators Advance 
</P>
<P>
TW Services jumped 2 5/8 to 31 3/4. The company asked its investment bankers to 
investigate alternatives to a $29-a-share takeover bid by Coniston Partners. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,953.138, up 23.655 from 
Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added 1.43 to 
168.10. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.04 to 346.01, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was up 2.77 at 299.44. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 2.53 to 
409.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at 
332.52, up 0.73. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese stocks ended mixed Thursday after investors took profits. The 
225-share Nikkei index eased 2.24 points to close at 32,098.24. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices fell in light trading, reflecting what brokers called 
renewed worries about slower growth and inflationary pressures. At the close, 
the Financial Times 100-share index was down 8.6 points, or 0.4%, at 2,112.6. 
The Financial Times 30-share index fell 14.2 points to 1,740.1.

COCODRILO BEVERAGE HOPES JALAPENO-FLAVORED SOFT DRINKS WILL SPICE UP LATINO 
MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Singer hadn't planned to chuck it all and go into business for himself, 
but then he had this idea . . . 
</P>
<P>
As an advertising and marketing professional, Singer usually had a drawer full 
of ideas. But this one was special. It was, well, hot. 
</P>
<P>
Singer decided to break into the highly competitive but potentially lucrative 
$40-billion-a-year soft drink market with a product aimed specifically at 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, he formed a company, Cocodrilo Beverage Inc. in Fountain Valley, to 
develop and market a soft drink livened up with jalapeno juice! 
</P>
<P>
Singer chose the Latino market because it represents the fastest-growing ethnic 
group in the country. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Latino population has increased five 
times faster than the rest of the population since 1980, up almost 35% to 19.4 
million last year from 14.4 million at the beginning of the decade. About 3.8 
million Latinos live in Southern California alone, up 31% from 2.9 million in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
And nationally, the Latino population is expected to double by the year 2020 
and to nearly triple to 19% of the total population by 2080, according to the 
Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Singer's decision was a smart one, said Alan Wolf, editor of Beverage World 
magazine. "Lots of companies are looking at the Hispanic market, even 
established players like Coors and Anheuser-Busch," he said. "There is a 
recognition that it is a well-developed market, but one with a different 
cultural background that takes a special marketing effort." 
</P>
<P>
But aside from a few imports from Mexico and South America, Singer asked 
himself, was anyone offering a soft drink targeted directly at Latinos? 
</P>
<P>
He asked his questions again, this time in a discussion with a friend -- a 
biochemist interested in food and drink -- during a beach party in Laguna Beach 
in July, 1987. And from that conversation the idea was born. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 20 months, several dozen formulations, seven market tests and about 
$140,000 later -- most of it his own money -- Singer is preparing to launch an 
unusual line of soft drinks -- natural lemon-lime, mango and cola flavors 
spiced with the essence of jalapeno and serrano chili peppers. 
</P>
<P>
Cocodrilo -- Spanish for crocodile -- isn't the world's first spicy soda pop. 
In 1987, a small company in Louisiana introduced Cajun Cola, accented with 
cayenne pepper and spices popular in Cajun cookery. 
</P>
<P>
But Singer's soda, according to Lynn Dornblaser, general manager of New 
Products News in Chicago, appears to be the first developed expressely to 
appeal to the Latino market, where palates are culturally attuned to seasonings 
that carry a bit of a kick. 
</P>
<P>
If it manages to make any kind of dent in that market -- which accounts for 
about 7% of the total U.S. population and nearly 25% of the California 
population -- Cocodrilo could become a business success. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, colas account for 70% of the soft drink market, and lemon-lime 
drinks rake in 10% of all sales. The Latino population's share of soft drink 
purchases was about $2.8 billion, so if Cocodrilo could pick up even 1% of that 
it would mean about $28 million in sales, Singer reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Singer and Percy Rivera, Cocodrilo's newly appointed president, hope 
the drinks will have appeal outside of the Latino community as well. There are, 
they reason, a lot of people from a lot of cultures who like foods that bite 
back. 
</P>
<P>
That bite is a key marketing tool for the company. Cocodrilo's "mascot" is 
grinning, sunglass-wearing Pepe Cocodrilo, and the toothy reptile is featured 
prominently on the label. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing slogans include "You'll like its bite!" "Get Croc'd!" and "No more 
wimpy soft drinks!" 
</P>
<P>
It takes more than snappy slogans or a cute mascot, however, to make it in the 
nation's competitive soft drink industry. 
</P>
<P>
Even things like taste, price and, yes, uniqueness, take a back seat to 
distribution, according to industry watchers like Gary Hemphill, editor of 
Beverage Industry, a monthly trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting distribution is the key," he said, "and that is difficult because 
there are a lot more soft drink products than space to display them." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in just the last 2 years, nearly 150 new soft drinks have been 
introduced around the country, said Dornblaser. Almost all of them were niche 
market products introduced only on a regional basis -- including a diet 
peanut-chocolate fudge drink and a caffeine-free, high-potassium cola and an 
herbal cola imported from China, both sold in health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
With that volume of competition, Hemphill said, "the independent stores, the 
mom-and-pop places, are the place to go at first so you can build up a track 
record of sales. That's what the chain stores want to see before they'll take a 
chance with your product." 
</P>
<P>
But even getting into the corner market can be difficult for an independent, 
regional product. 
</P>
<P>
Cocodrilo comes in both lemon-lime and cola flavors, and because of exclusivity 
clauses in their contracts, the various major brands' bottlers and distributors 
won't deal with a company like Singer's, said soft drink marketing consultant 
Bruce Oman. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to go is with beer distributors or through food distributors and 
brokers." 
</P>
<P>
At Cocodrilo, thanks largely to company President Rivera's background, the 
initial major distribution push will be through beer distributors in 13 
northwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
Singer said Cocodrilo has just about completed negotiations with a master 
distributor in Seattle who believes that he can market about 100,000 cases of 
the spicy sodas through 132 sub-distributors in the 13-state area. 
</P>
<P>
But Rivera, who came to Singer's company last June when Moctezuma Brewing in 
Mexico shut down its beer importing franchise in Santa Ana, says Cocodrilo 
wants to hang on to California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas -- the most 
heavily Latino states in the West -- for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking a developed distribution network and the cash to set one up, the 
company is HOTHEDhoping that successful sales to the north will combine with 
word of mouth from test markets in Orange and Los Angeles counties to set up a 
growing consumer demand for Cocodrilo drinks. 
</P>
<P>
To help promote the drinks, Cocodrilo also has provided a free supply to the 
athletic departments at all three of Santa Ana's high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Coombs, basketball coach at heavily Latino Santa Ana High School, said 
that the drinks were sold at a number of games to raise money for the sports 
program and that feedback from consumers, mainly high school students, "was 
pretty good. The kids seemed to like it. It was something they could identify 
as their own." 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Cocodrilo's secret weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera helped Moctezuma introduce Hussong's Beer to Southern California in late 
1985. In so doing, he got to know Ricardo Hussong, proprietor of the famous 
cantina in Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
On July 4, 1988, Hussong's began using Cocodrilo lemon-lime as a bar mix and 
created several drinks -- including a "Croc-tail" -- by blending the peppery 
soda with tequila. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera said his vice president of marketing, Tim Kirchner, recently overheard 
two youths discussing a recent trip to Baja California while standing in line 
at a local amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim told me that one of them started talking about Hussong's, and the other 
said that he'd tried a new drink there made with 'this real rad Crocodile 
stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
That might not sound like much -- but best-selling Corona Beer got its start 
when surfers and vacationers from the United States who had sampled the brew in 
Mexican cantinas started asking for it at their local liquor stores.

ANALYSTS LOOK FOR GM TO OFFER INCENTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<DATELINE>

DETROIT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Auto industry analysts are waiting for industry leader General Motors to "drop 
the other shoe" and announce an incentive program that will stimulate its 
sagging auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mystifying why they haven't come out with more incentives," said analyst 
Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.. 
</P>
<P>
But the giant auto maker says it is satisfied, for now, with its current 
program combining rebates and low-rate financing on selected models and plans 
no revision soon. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. auto sales so far this year are down nearly 10% from last year's levels, 
and truck sales, which for the past five years have climbed steadily, are off 
2%. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the annual selling rate, which reflects the pace of auto sales 
over a year's time, has dropped to 7 million units. That compares to the 7.5 
million cars sold in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. auto makers had expected sales to be somewhat slower this year simply 
because last year's pace was unexpectedly strong. 
</P>
<P>
But GM, which once took almost half of U.S. car sales, had designated 1989 as 
the year it would halt a market share decline that has lasted for the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, GM's auto sales are down 14.5% and it has continued to lose U.S. car 
market share. At the end of 1988, its share stood at 36.1%. But it has slipped 
to 35.8% in the first 10 weeks of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The auto maker, whose inventories are well above the supplies seen as normal 
for winter, has closed several plants temporarily to curb supplies and plans to 
shut its Framingham, Mass., plant indefinitely in August. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect that GM eventually will be forced to launch a major incentive 
program similar to the 2.9% financing plan that boosted late summer sales in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
They thought such a program would be announced last week, but GM instead came 
out with a broader version of a program already in place that included offers 
of rebates, free gasoline for a year on some models and financing of 4.9% on 
short-term loans. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Monday, GM President Robert Stempel said the company was 
satisfied with its inventory situation and actually was short of some models. 
He said GM had no plans to improve the 4.9% financing offer.

CHORALES TO SING BERLIOZ'S REQUIEM AT CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC FOR 1837 FUNERAL CHOSEN AS 200TH ANNIVERSARY SALUTE TO THE FRENCH 
REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Visual artists had been depicting scary scenes of the Day of Judgment for 
centuries before classical composers got into the act. 
</P>
<P>
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel shocker, "The Last Judgment," was finished in 
1541. But it was not until 1837 that the tradition of apocalyptic music got a 
proper launch with Berlioz's Requiem. 
</P>
<P>
Berlioz scored the work for 210 voices and 190 instruments -- along with four 
separate brass choirs and 16 kettledrums -- all to scare the dickens out of his 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
John Alexander will conduct the work Sunday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa, and, yes, there will be four brass choirs and 16 
timpani. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion for the premiere of the Berlioz work was a pumped-up state funeral 
for a certain General Damremont, who had been killed in a French assault on an 
Algerian city. 
</P>
<P>
Berlioz's music was played after a long state procession that was accompanied 
by muffled drums, and the music was interrupted by the chants and responses of 
the church service. 
</P>
<P>
According to historians, the windows of the church, the Invalides in Paris, 
were boarded over and the walls draped in black. Eminent historian, educator 
and Berlioz scholar Jacques Barzun described the scene further: "Around the 
coffin flickered 600 candles and incense boats. One thousand other pinpoints of 
light dotted the gloomy shell." 
</P>
<P>
Voila! Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Berlioz had placed his four brass choirs at the cardinal points of the compass, 
in effect surrounding the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The listeners had never heard anything like it, and because applause was not 
permitted at a church service, their response at the end was not registered in 
that way. We can surmise that when it was all over, though, that they probably 
looked as dazed as moviegoers stumbling out of "The Exorcist" or heavy metal 
rock fans leaving a Black Sabbath concert. 
</P>
<P>
The critics approved. The German poet Heine was moved to hyperbole, although 
today his words might sound more like an insult than praise. As a maker of 
music, Heine wrote, Berlioz was like "an antediluvian bird, a colossal 
nightingale or a lark the size of an eagle." (Critics wrote like that in those 
days.) 
</P>
<P>
Because of the asymmetrical design of the Center's Segerstrom Hall, Alexander 
will put one brass choir on the third tier and one on the second tier and put 
one on each side of the orchestra seating. 
</P>
<P>
"That's for the big 'Tuba Mirum' section, where the brass first really show 
off," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all of the work is loud. Of its 100 minutes, probably only 20 use the 
full artillery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an extraordinary amount of diversity in the scoring," he said. 'The 
pianissimo sections are as extraordinary as the large sections, and probably 
over the half of the work is very serene and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Two such sections are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The "Offertorium," in which the choir sings only on two notes a half step 
apart -- until it breaks into a rainbow chord at the close -- as the orchestra 
weaves an increasingly elaborate and poignant accompaniment around the singers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The "Hostias," in which Berlioz experiments with thin orchestral textures, 
sending the flutes into their high range while taking the trombones to their 
lowest notes. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said that this will be the first performance of the work in Orange 
County and that he chose it to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's being celebrated all over the world," he said, "but we aren't doing much 
in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
John Alexander will conduct the Pacific and Valley Master chorales and the 
Pacific Symphony in Berlioz's Requiem at 8 p.m. Sunday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Featured soloist 
will be tenor Paul Johnson. Tickets: $12.50 to $35. Information: (714) 
542-1790.

ACTOR BRINGS BIT O' IRELAND TO ST. PAT'S CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shamrocks and shillelaghs, leprechauns and green beer. . . . These are the 
things of which St. Patrick's Day celebrations are made -- in America, at any 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Irish-born actor and singer Shay Duffin takes the stereotyping in stride. "It's 
a friendly attitude," the Redondo Beach resident said in a phone interview this 
week. "Everybody wants to be Irish." Besides, he asked, what other nationality 
is celebrated in the United States with a whole day all of its own? 
</P>
<P>
Still, Duffin refuses to pander to the quaint American view of Irish folklore, 
preferring in his own stage performances to spotlight the island nation's rich 
literary, theatrical and musical heritage. "I'm always trying to raise the 
level of the appreciation of the Irish," said Duffin, who performs Saturday in 
Huntington Beach as part of a St. Patrick's Day celebration being sponsored by 
the Irish Fine Arts Society of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Duffin's performance will include storytelling drawn from the lives and 
writings of such Irish giants as James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde 
and William Butler Yeats. "I'll be stealing from everybody. Stealing from one 
person is plagiarism; stealing from many people is research," Duffin quipped. 
</P>
<P>
As always, the literary references will be leavened with humor: "Just do it and 
get the laugh, and they don't know they've been hit with a Shaw or a Joyce." 
</P>
<P>
Duffin is best known for his portrayal of Brendan Behan, the colorful writer 
and anti-English rebel whose works include the autobiographical novel "Borstal 
Boy" and the satirical play "The Hostage." Behan, whose drinking was legendary, 
died in 1964 at age 41. ("Too young to die, too drunk to live," was how the 
London Times eulogized him.) 
</P>
<P>
At last count, Duffin has performed his one-man Behan show 3,844 times. He hits 
the road in a few weeks to bring the show to Canada and the East Coast. 
Saturday's show will include an excerpt. 
</P>
<P>
Duffin knew Behan, 26 years his elder, as a youth growing up in the same Dublin 
neighborhood. Duffin was a biking enthusiast and on Sundays Behan often would 
drop by the local team's locker room, where the cyclists would mix brandy with 
a glucose solution for their morning rides. "That was the only place you could 
get a drink on a Sunday," Duffin said. "Consequently, that's where you found 
the bold Brendan. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had the discipline, he could have been one of the world's greatest 
entertainers. When you see a 41-year-old man die of too much booze, it's a 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Duffin, who said he does not drink, brought the Behan show to Dublin for the 
first time 3 years ago and played for 3 weeks in the historic Olympia Theatre. 
In the audience one night were Behan's mother and his widow, Beatrice. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very exciting," said Duffin, who bears a physical resemblance to Behan. 
Brendan's mother, then 94, "kept interrupting, because she thought it was 
Brendan up there." 
</P>
<P>
The show gained the family's approval -- "the Behans said, 'You do him proud' " 
-- but prompted a few quibbles from the local critics: "His American twang is 
very distracting," Duffin said, reciting from a review. "He's been out in 
Hollywood too long." (To ears perhaps less trained, however, his brogue still 
sounds 100% Irish.) 
</P>
<P>
Duffin, who moved to Canada from Ireland in 1963, started in show business as a 
singer of Irish folk songs and recorded five albums for RCA. Saturday, he will 
sing updated versions of a few auld favorites. One, called "Green Cards" (sung 
to the tune of "Greensleeves"), takes a satiric look at Ireland's wave of 
departing emigrants. "Ronnie, We Are Glad to Know Ye" is sung from the 
perspective of the homeless to the tune of "Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye." 
</P>
<P>
Current projects include a new one-man show called "Beyond Pale." "The 
importance of being Irish is the theme of the show," Duffin said. "One-man 
shows are great," he added, "but the cast parties are lousy." 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, he will appear with Vanessa Redgrave in a movie about the 
Irish uprising of 1916 and with Mickey Rourke in a film about the Doukhobors, a 
rebellious Russian community in Canada at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Duffin, a widower whose children are now grown, also will keep to the road, 
continuing his Behan shows and another, more cabaret-oriented act. "I'll sing 
or entertain at the drop of a hat, and if I get paid, that's the bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's revue, sponsored by the Irish Fine Arts Society of Orange County, 
will feature Shay Duffin with singers Michael McCormack and Jan Knolton, dancer 
Vinnie O'Connor, the Nicholas Pipe Band and harpist Ellie Shoate. The 
dinner/cabaret show begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Huntington Beach Inn, 21112 
Pacific Coast Highway, Huntington Beach. Admission: $45, includes dinner, 
dancing and show. Information: (714) 840-7903.

<P>
On this chilly, overcast day, Robert Ida is once again making his morning 
rounds of a small, aged school building, deep in a bleakly obscure neighborhood 
of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Ida surveys the grounds carefully -- a solitary figure in baggy jeans, old work 
shirt and scruffy zoris -- making sure each window, doorway and classroom is 
secure. As usual, he says, he finds no signs of tampering or vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Such loving attention might seem wasted on such a worn and homely building. But 
the 80-foot-long, whitewashed, clapboard building is no ordinary school, 
certainly not to someone like Ida. 
</P>
<P>
To four generations of Japanese-Americans, the five-classroom building, which 
looks more like an abandoned store than a cultural center, is both monument and 
haven. 
</P>
<P>
It explains why Robert Ida, 65, has kept a personal watch, making the 
ritualistic trek to the school every morning, every year -- for 3 decades. 
</P>
<P>
The building is the home of the Garden Grove Japanese Language School, built in 
1914, but still providing classes every Saturday morning from 8 to noon 
(currently, for 40 youngsters) as the longest-running school of its kind in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We all went here as kids -- I did, my brothers and sisters did," says Ida, 
standing on the school's side porch, his manner reverent, as if he were about 
to enter a church. 
</P>
<P>
But once inside, his mood turns to boyish, almost impish delight. 
</P>
<P>
Gazing at the blackboard filled with basic Japanese phrases, at the battered 
desktop chairs and at the student drawings pinned on walls, Ida laughs, touched 
by images from 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Right here," he says with a huge grin, "this was our room. And there, near the 
window, is where I sat." 
</P>
<P>
For someone like Ida, in a place like this old school, the memories -- 
especially the good ones -- are like yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally ebullient, an engagingly loquacious and gregarious sort, Robert Ida 
is someone easy to like. 
</P>
<P>
And at 65, Ida, a gardener by profession, seems to have become more 
whimsical-looking with age. His face is a mass of crinkles when he grins. His 
once-bristling, thick crew cut is now receded to wayward patches of fuzz. 
</P>
<P>
But this cheerful aura vanishes whenever the matter of bulldozer redevelopment 
is brought up. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the language school's future is in doubt. The school's original 
neighborhood -- now an outmoded melange of salvage yards, milling operations 
and ancient dwellings southwest of Garden Grove Boulevard and Euclid Street -- 
is earmarked by the city for massive clearance. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current municipal proposal -- which has yet to become final -- most 
of the neighborhood would be replaced with a $20-million, 16-acre showcase 
development of big stores, restaurants and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Ida's connection to all this isn't just the school. It's a profoundly familial 
one. 
</P>
<P>
He has lived nearly his entire life on the lot just behind the school. He was 
born there. He resided in the four-bedroom house built in the 1920s by his 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
But a year ago, Ida -- a bachelor and the last of his family to live in the 
house -- moved off the lot. And 4 months later, the structure was demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has seen better days. 
</P>
<P>
Like all of Garden Grove and most of Orange County after the turn of the 
century, the area in and around the neighborhood was once overwhelmingly rural. 
</P>
<P>
There were clusters of homes, shops and work camps, but mostly it was vast 
fields of strawberries, celery, sugar beets and acres of orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a newcomer phenomenon that brought both tension and curiosity -- 
the large influx of Japanese farmers who called themselves Issei, or 
first-generation immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
By 1910, the number of Issei was an estimated 600 in Orange County, many of 
them with families, all of them resourceful, tireless and iron-willed men. 
</P>
<P>
Kikumatsu Ida -- Robert's grandfather -- was one such Issei. He had been a 
Japanese soldier serving in Manchuria and Korea in the 1890s, then Beijing 
during the 1900 Boxer Rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
His immigration to America was typical of other Issei. He labored on farms in 
Hawaii and railroads in Washington state, spent time in San Francisco (he lived 
through the titanic 1906 earthquake and fire), and was attracted to Orange 
County by visions of an agricultural wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
His first venture, a chicken farm in Santa Ana, was wiped out in the county's 
great 1916 flood. But when he moved to Garden Grove and to that lot behind the 
language school, he built a small back-yard factory for making tofu, or 
Oriental bean curd. This venture, an immediate success, lasted for years. 
</P>
<P>
But this was an era particularly notorious for anti-Asian legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't bury our people in Orange County," Robert Ida says. "I'm serious 
-- it was forbidden by ordinances. When my two older brothers died (of typhoid 
after the 1916 flood), it was especially distressing. My family was told they 
had to take the bodies to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
There were more sweeping examples of legal sleight-of-hand. Like other Asian 
aliens, Kikumatsu Ida and Robert's father, Sei, could lease land but not own 
it. "One law prevented them from becoming citizens," says Robert Ida. "Then the 
other one declared only U.S. citizens could buy land." 
</P>
<P>
While some Japanese immigrants, embittered by such American sentiments, 
returned to Japan, most Issei vowed to remain, like grandfather Ida. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, he wanted us to remember the old heritage, to keep our ethnic 
identity, so he made sure we went to Japanese school," Ida says, referring to 
the Garden Grove school, a three-classroom facility when built by Issei farmers 
in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
"But grandfather never went back to Japan. He never wanted to. He told us that 
America was now our country, and that opportunities here were limitless. My 
father felt the same way." 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore that belief -- that the Japanese immigrant families were to 
find their new roots in America -- the Idas in the late 1920s built their first 
permanent dwelling here. This was the one-story redwood house on the lot behind 
the school, the dwelling that became home to 11 children and that was to stand 
for 6 decades. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember any big problems, really. Everyone seemed to get along, 
because all of us -- Caucasians and Japanese -- were in the same kind of work 
and had the same aspirations," recalls Ida of central Orange County in the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was because (Japanese-American) families were also so active in 
community affairs. Maybe it was the sheer numbers here: About one-fourth of the 
kids in our (public) schools were from our families." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Ida was 17, mainstream American assimilation seemed to be going 
well. And he was eyeing his next milestone -- graduating the following June as 
a member of the Garden Grove High class of '42. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he never made that ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month after Japan's Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, the Ida 
family, along with hundreds of other Japanese-Americans from Orange County, 
were interned in a converted military base in Poston, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The two oldest Ida sons, Leonard and Roy, like numerous other young internees, 
decided to take the government's official alternative -- they enlisted in the 
military (both Idas served with the Army in the Pacific). 
</P>
<P>
But the father, Sei Ida, like many other internees who were born in Japan and 
were active in Japanese-American organizations, was kept incarcerated under 
close surveillance in California camps. 
</P>
<P>
"People like him were somehow questionable -- maybe because, years ago, he had 
served as a conscripted youth in the Japanese army," Ida suggests. "Who really 
knows why they held our father? They didn't tell you then -- we still don't 
know why." 
</P>
<P>
When the Idas returned in 1945 to Garden Grove, they were able to reclaim their 
old house and leased lot "without much hassle," Ida recalls. "We were one of 
the lucky ones. The people we were dealing with were good people." 
</P>
<P>
But many returning families, Ida says, found their homes ransacked, while 
others never could win back their old properties or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
And, the Idas learned, the Garden Grove Japanese Language School had been 
gutted twice during the war by arson. Ironically, for some time after the war, 
the rebuilt school served as a shelter for homeless former internees. 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, Ida says, the mood for Japanese-Americans in Orange 
County, as elsewhere, was one of caution. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept a low profile, believe me," he explains. "Feeling was still running 
high, especially those Americans who had lost family or friends in the war. For 
most people, things eventually got calmer. But some people we knew never spoke 
to us again." 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't until 1957 that the Japanese-language classes were resumed -- 
quietly -- at the old Garden Grove school for the first time since 1941. 
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese school's neighborhood would never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove in the 1950s had changed, virtually overnight, from quintessential 
farm community to quintessential bedroom suburb -- the population soaring from 
3,800 to 84,200 in that decade alone. 
</P>
<P>
And the old neighborhood itself, now ringed by tract homes and new stores, was 
reduced to a forlorn state -- an isolated pocket of farm-era remnants, such as 
the Ida house and a handful of other aged dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, the city considered the neighborhood ripe for urban renewal, the 
kind that had already led to massive revamping of the civic center sector and 
Main Street commercial row just across Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But the fate of the Japanese school under the city's current plan isn't clear. 
The Garden Grove Historical Society wants the school to remain operating at the 
1914 site. Another option: Move the building to the society's Heritage Park 
museum on Euclid Street, and offer the same elementary-level language classes 
at another site. No decision is expected for some time. 
</P>
<P>
The school is under siege from yet another 1980s trend. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in these private, ethnic-language programs is declining alarmingly, 
according to the Japanese Language School Assn. of America. Overall 
Japanese-American enrollment in seven such Southern California schools, the 
association reports, has dropped in recent years from 900 to 600 students, even 
though the population has increased dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove school itself hasn't been spared. In the past decade, its 
enrollment has dropped from 80 to 40 students, all between the ages of 4 and 
16. Tuition is $25 a month and there is a teaching staff of five, all born in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
It's another morning at the school grounds, another watchman's visitation for 
Robert Ida. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, Ida makes a poignant detour: He walks to the back fence and 
gazes across at the vacant lot that, until a year ago, had been his home for 65 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The lot is now completely stripped -- only overturned dirt, patches of weeds 
and, at the far end, a large crater where the house had stood. 
</P>
<P>
Silent for a few moments, staring at the crater, Ida then confides: "I had to 
get out. It was my decision. There were false alarms about the area going 
under. But this time, it looks like it's going to happen, and I don't want to 
sit around, waiting for the ax. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't here last July (for the demolition)." He now lives in a small tract 
house a few blocks away. "I made sure I was working somewhere else that day. 
You can't bear to see something like that. . . . Too many memories." 
</P>
<P>
"Something's gone, you know." His tone is even more rueful. "The spirit isn't 
really here anymore. It doesn't feel like a community anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Gone, too, is the once-overwhelming sense of ethnic identity. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't seem to care about (ethnic heritage) like they used to. Our 
families moved out years ago when the newer (tract) homes took over. Everyone's 
scattered now. And the younger (Japanese-Americans) -- most of them seem 
disinterested in their heritage, too busy with other things." 
</P>
<P>
Ida, however, is not the sort to dwell long on the melancholy. He is, like the 
Issei before him, too much a realist and pragmatist. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fight change and you can't stop it. You take it in stride. You learn 
to live with it. " 
</P>
<P>
As he walks toward the front gate, he looks back at the school building -- 
still standing after 74 years, still serving at least some of the new 
generations. "But sometimes, if you're real lucky, people can delay change -- a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
The thought is obviously a warmly pleasant one for an old alumnus like Robert 
Ida. He awards it one of his widest, most crinkled grins.

ORANGE COUNTY'S BREEDING BIRDS 
</P>

The Orange County Breeding Bird Atlas, a joint project of the local Sea and 
Sage Audubon Society and the National Audubon Society, is a five-year project 
to map the nesting areas of the more than 100 bird species that breed in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The project, now in its third year, divides the county into 111 blocks, each 5 
kilometers square. During breeding season, from February through September, 
volunteers survey their assigned blocks on a regular basis. When breeding 
activity is discovered, the block is listed as "confirmed" for that species. 
</P>
<P>
The list below shows bird species that have been found to breed in Orange 
County, followed by the number of blocks in which the species has been 
confirmed through the 1988 breeding season. Some species -- including the most 
widespread local breeder, the European starling -- are not native to the 
county, and may in fact be harming native species by competing for limited food 
resources and nesting sites. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, Clipboard will profile one of Orange County's breeding birds, 
including an illustration of the bird, a map showing where it has been 
discovered to breed, and notes on its natural history. 
</P>
<P>
For information on the atlas and on how to participate in its final year, call 
the Sea and Sage Audubon Society chapter office, (714) 543-7393.

A March 10 article on the dismissal of charges against two brothers arrested in 
connection with an alleged money laundering operation in the Los Angeles 
jewelry district incorrectly reported that evidence linking them had been based 
on FBI wiretaps. The wiretaps cited by the government against Hagop Etmekjian 
and his brother, Garbis, actually were conducted by the federal Drug 
Enforcement Administration.

BUSH LIFTS BAN ON CHILEAN FRUIT; 
</P>
<P>
GRAPES EXPECTED TO REAPPEAR IN STORES IN 5-9 DAYS

<P>
The Bush Administration said today that it will allow Chilean fruit back on the 
U.S. market, ending a five-day public health scare sparked by the discovery of 
traces of cyanide in two grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"With these and other safeguards in place we believe that this program will 
provide the maximum feasible safety for fruit from Chile," FDA Commissioner 
Frank Young told a news conference after outlining a plan for stepped-up 
inspections in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he had "high confidence of detecting anything if something was 
there." But he conceded, "It is impossible to insure 100% safety." And he urged 
grocers and consumers to make their own checks when Chilean fruit reappears on 
the shelves in five to nine days. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced despite a third poisoning threat received by the U.S. 
Embassy in Santiago, Young said. He said he got word of the latest threat, 
which was made today, a short time before he announced the plan. He said the 
latest threat doesn't raise any more concern than the first two. 
</P>
<P>
Young outlined the Administration's plans for ending the five-day public health 
scare after President Bush told reporters that the quarantine of Chilean fruit 
had been justified despite any economic hardship it imposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Some Economic Hardship' 
</P>
<P>
"It has cost some economic hardship that I regret," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when the health of the American people might be threatened you've got 
to take prudent action," the President told reporters aboard Air Force One en 
route back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
At a crowded news conference a few minutes later, Young said, "We are now ready 
to reintroduce Chilean fruit, beginning with grapes, blueberries, raspberries 
and strawberries." 
</P>
<P>
He said that since the small amounts of cyanide were found in two grapes over 
the weekend, no additional evidence of contamination has been uncovered. He 
said 13,000 crates of fruit have been inspected since the two poisoned grapes 
were found. 
</P>
<P>
Young said Chilean fruit en route to the United States will be subjected to 
increased inspection, and said the Chilean government will take safety measures 
before allowing produce to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Jobs in Chile 
</P>
<P>
He said fruit in some ships in port in Philadelphia also will be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
But he said, "Any Chilean fruit in the hands of importers . . . will be 
destroyed to eliminate fruit that cannot be practically inspected." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the two poisoned grapes touched off a major public health 
scare in this country and difficulties of a different sort in Chile, where 
fruit is a major export and where thousands of agricultural workers have been 
threatened with the loss of their jobs during the peak harvest season. 
</P>
<P>
Young dismissed questions about who would bear the cost of the lost fruit and 
the inspections. "The day I start to look at health with regard to somebody's 
left hip pocket or pocketbook, then I am not focusing enough in regard to 
safety," he said.

The crew of the space shuttle Discovery began preparing today to return home, 
saying that the flight had seemed short and that they would have liked to stay 
up longer. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery is scheduled to land Saturday at 6:36 a.m. PST at Edwards Air 
Force Base in California's Mojave Desert.

Mission specialist James Bagian told NBC's "Today Show" in an interview from 
space: "The one thing that all of us are impressed by is that the time goes by 
extremely quickly. It's hard to believe it was five days ago that we launched. 
There are so many things we'd like to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bagian said the crew wished it had more time to conduct experiments and just 
look out the window. "Having the opportunity to just look at the Earth. . . . 
None of us can get too much of that time," he said.

An armored car guard was slain today in a shoot-out at a supermarket with a 
robber who then killed himself after deputies arrived, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 9:45 a.m. inside a glass-enclosed entrance of a 
Von's market at 4001 Hardwick St., Deputy Bill Wehner, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman, said. Customers and employees were in the store when the shooting 
erupted, but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the guard who worked for Armored Transport of California Inc. was 
not immediately available. When deputies entered the store the gunman was lying 
near the doorway with a self-inflicted wound. He died en route to a hospital.

A Fullerton mother who had just watched her teen-age daughter play softball 
died after a suspected drunk driver ran a red light and crashed into her car, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Sue Brasington, 39, a church volunteer worker and mother of 
two teen-agers, was turning off Tamarack Avenue to go east on Lambert Road 
Thursday afternoon when a Ford pickup truck driven by Steven Spaur, 30, of 
Whittier ran the light and crashed into Brasington's Chevrolet van about 4:53 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers were taken to Brea Community Hospital. Brasington was pronounced 
dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Spaur, who did not have a valid driver's license, was treated and released. He 
was later arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and felony drunk 
driving. He was being held in the Orange County Jail on $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
One of Brasington's friends said she had just left a Rosary Junior High School 
softball game at Tamarack Park, where she and her husband, Mitchell, had been 
watching their 14-year-old daughter, Courtney, play.

DEADLOCKED JURY RESUMES ITS WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the murder trial of Danny Davis Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park, who 
Thursday had declared themselves "hopelessly deadlocked," resumed deliberations 
this morning after the trial judge reinstructed them on the legal meaning of 
"implied malice aforethought." 
</P>
<P>
The definition is critical to the prosecution's effort to convict Ornelas of 
second-degree murder in the Sept. 1 death of Debbie Killelea, who was struck by 
a speeding car and killed in an alley behind her Balboa Peninsula home while a 
passenger videotaped the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas is accused of having had "implied malice aforethought" by speeding up 
the alley and failing to brake when he saw Killelea and her two sons walking 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Dep. Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals, argued that Ornelas, though 
drunk at the time by legal definition, knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors Thursday declared themselves deadlocked, but Orange County Superior 
Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas ordered them to continue deliberations.

The son of Vincennes commander Capt. Will Rogers III has been moved off campus 
from his Colgate University dormitory so that Navy bodyguards can protect him 
from possible terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes was the Navy cruiser that accidentally downed an Iranian 
passenger jet in July. Security at the upstate New York university has been 
heightened in the week since a bomb exploded in a van driven by the captain's 
wife, Sharon Lee Rogers, in San Diego, said Colgate spokesman James Leach. 
</P>
<P>
Will Rogers IV, a Colgate sophomore, and Navy officials declined to discuss the 
security measures. Students at the university said the younger Rogers is 
accompanied by two to four bodyguards whenever he is on the campus.

The Treasury Department may ban imports of additional kinds of semiautomatic 
weapons, following earlier suspension of imports of five types, a spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is still reviewing the 
uses of all types of semiautomatics that are imported, but has not reached a 
decision on whether to suspend importation of more models than the five types 
banned from import this week, said Jerry Rudden, spokesman for the BATF. 
</P>
<P>
"The process is ongoing. Additional firearms may very well be added to the 
list. . . . Large numbers of firearms are being looked at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said a report that the BATF had added some weapons to the list and then 
changed its mind was erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen had said earlier that she understood such a 
decision had been made by BATF but that it was done "without any pressure or 
direction from any other agency," including the White House and the Treasury 
Department hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff John H. Sununu's office also heard that BATF might add more 
weapons to its suspension, said a Sununu aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The aide said he called BATF officials to learn if that was true and 
was told that the bureau was still evaluating the matter and has no 
announcement planned on expanding the ban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Seeking Information 
</P>
<P>
The aide said he was only seeking information and the call did not indicate any 
White House pressure, although the lobbyist for the National Rifle Assn., Wayne 
La Pierre, met with Sununu on Thursday while Bush was traveling in Texas and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes, Sununu's aide said, and did not 
involve discussion of a potential expanded suspension. LaPierre brought a copy 
of the NRA's public comment on the suspension, and discussed some concerns 
about legislation in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
NRA officials refused comment today on any of their contacts with the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported today that BATF had intended on Thursday to 
announce it would supplement an import ban announced two days earlier on such 
weapons as the Uzi and AK-47.

EX-HAZELTINE EXECUTIVE SENTENCED IN ARMS FRAUD 
</P>

<P>
A former executive of the Hazeltine Corp., the first figure in the sweeping 
Pentagon corruption investigation to face sentencing, was ordered today to 
serve three months in prison for conspiring to defraud the government. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton granted leniency to Charles Furciniti, 54, 
under federal sentencing guidelines after Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Aronica 
declared that Furciniti had been fully cooperative with investigators and had 
shown remorse since pleading guilty Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also sentenced Furciniti to pay a $20,000 fine and to serve 150 hours 
of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Furciniti, in a brief statement requesting that he be spared jail time, told 
the judge: 
</P>
<P>
"My 30-year career in the defense industry is over. . . . I have become 
infamous in my community and have embarrassed myself with my family. I am so 
ashamed that I have asked none of my five children to attend today's hearing. . 
. . I am truly sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Furciniti pleaded guilty along with another former executive of Hazeltine, 
which is a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co., to conspiracy to defraud the 
federal government and to commit wire fraud, a charge stemming from 
investigators' use of electronic listening devices during the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gained Bidding Information 
</P>
<P>
Furciniti and Joseph Colarusso admitted obtaining inside information from two 
industry consultants about competitors' bids to help their firm win a 
$150-million contract for aircraft radar testing devices. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation from Furciniti and Colarusso is believed to have bolstered the 
government's case against consultants William Parkin and Fred Lackner, key 
figures in the investigation code-named "Operation Ill Wind." 
</P>
<P>
Parkin and Lackner face trial next week along with a Navy engineer, Teledyne 
Industries Inc. and three Teledyne executives on the remaining 25 counts of an 
indictment charging an elaborate scheme to pass bribes in exchange for inside 
contract information. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Hilton granted defense requests to dismiss two racketeering 
counts from the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Furciniti told Hilton today, "I have asked myself a thousand times why did I 
agree to participate with Mr. Parkin. . . . I rationalized my behavior. I never 
asked myself who Parkin was dealing with and behaved accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
He said that in trying to win the contract for the Navy's UPM-150 program, he 
"never really looked at the actions from the Navy or government viewpoint."

Strikebound Eastern Airlines is having a tough time attracting business fliers, 
although passenger levels on some routes are good, including those linking 
Miami, the Caribbean and Latin America, a spokesman said today. 
</P>

"In some of our markets, our loads are really quite good. Out of San Juan 
(Puerto Rico) yesterday, our load factors were over 60%," said Eastern 
spokesman Jim Ashlock. 
</P>
<P>
Ashlock said traffic is also strong on flights linking Miami with 12 South 
American cities, although he could offer no statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"Where it is tough is in your business markets," he said. Those markets include 
Eastern's Northeast shuttle, linking New York, Boston and Washington. The Wall 
Street Journal reported today that some shuttle flights are carrying just 15 
passengers since a bargain $12 fare was dropped.

WHOLESALE INCREASES HIKE INFLATION FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
BACK-TO-BACK MONTHLY HIKES WORST IN 8 YEARS

<P>
Wholesale prices surged 1% in February, matching the January increase and 
marking the worst back-to-back news on inflation in nearly eight years, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The identical increases in the Labor Department's producer price index mean 
that prices one stop short of the retail level are 12.6% higher, on an annual 
rate, than at the start of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Not since March and April, 1981, have prices risen so sharply for two months in 
a row. Wholesale prices rose 4% for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Stock and bond prices tumbled after today's report triggered renewed fears that 
the Federal Reserve Board will push interest rates higher in an attempt to tame 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
That would increase the government's cost of financing the $2.7-trillion 
national debt, which would be bad news for President Bush, who is trying to 
trim the budget deficit without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking to reporters as he returned to Washington from Colorado, said 
his Administration will "always be vigilant against inflation (and) never relax 
our concern." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hears 'Clarion Call' 
</P>
<P>
He said the best way to beat inflation would be an agreement with Congress to 
reduce the deficit and called today's report "another clarion call to do 
something." Negotiators from Capitol Hill and the White House will exchange 
proposals next week on bringing down the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
After the January inflation report, which included a 0.6% rise in the consumer 
price index, the largest in two years, many economists dismissed it as at least 
a partial aberration and predicted only a moderate 0.4% climb in February. 
</P>
<P>
With the latest report, "it's difficult to put a happy face on it," said 
Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Ortner. "There's no other interpretation that 
can be put on it other than it shows a pickup in inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Prices in both January and February were pushed up by soaring energy and food 
prices, but the cost of other items, which are generally more stable, increased 
at a worrisome rate in February as well. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale food prices rose 1.2% last month, the steepest increase in 13 months. 
They had risen 1.1% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Meat and most other food items rose, while eggs dropped 15% after rising 20.1% 
in January. Food prices were led by a 35.3% increase in vegetables, including a 
huge 158% rise in tomato prices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beef Increases Expected 
</P>
<P>
Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University said beef prices should 
continue to rise through the spring, until ranchers can rebuild herds that were 
culled by extra slaughtering during last summer's drought. 
</P>
<P>
He said fruit prices will continue to rise, at least temporarily, because fruit 
grown domestically in hothouses is more expensive than Chilean fruit held off 
supermarket shelves until next week because of the cyanide scare. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices jumped 2.4% overall in February, following a 4.9% increase a 
month earlier. The latest surge was led by a 4.1% rise in gasoline prices.

Dollar Rent A Car Systems of Beverly Hills has joined with a major European

The deal also means a name change for Swan, which now is part of the Dollar

JAPAN ECONOMY GROWS AT 15-YEAR RECORD PACE

Japan's economy grew at its fastest pace in 15 years in 1988, officials said 
today, even though consumers cut back on spending in the closing months out of 
respect for the dying Emperor Hirohito, 
</P>
<P>
Growth accelerated to 5.7% last year, up from 4.5% in 1987, as strong domestic 
demand propelled the economy forward. 
</P>
<P>
"1988 was a good year," said Takao Akabane, vice minister for economic 
planning. "And it was achieved because of domestic demand-led growth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good News for Trading Partners 
</P>
<P>
That is good news for Japan's trading partners, who have been pressing it to 
shift the emphasis of its economic growth away from exports toward domestic 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Both consumers and companies were big spenders last year. Consumers snapped up 
cars, electronic goods and expensive appliances while companies stepped up 
spending on factories and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The performance was the more impressive because it occurred despite a marked 
slowdown in growth in the final three months. 
</P>
<P>
The economy rose at an annualized pace of 3% in the final quarter of 1988 after 
roaring ahead at a 9.5% rate in the previous three months. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said consumers appeared reluctant to spend a lot of money on 
goods and lavish parties in the closing months of 1988 while Emperor Hirohito 
was on his deathbed. Hirohito, 87, died on Jan. 7 after a lengthy illness. 
</P>
<P>
"Outside of Tokyo, there was quite a slowdown in car sales in October and 
November," said Kenneth Courtis, economist at broker DB Capital Markets. 
"People felt they shouldn't splash money out on fancy new cars while the 
emperor was still sick." 
</P>
<P>
December is a big month for lavish corporate parties in Japan to celebrate the 
end of the year. But many companies scaled back their celebrations last year 
out of respect for Hirohito, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
Unusually warm weather also dampened sales of winter clothing in the final 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cutback in spending in the closing months of 1988 was greater than 
many economists expected, few evinced much concern about the underlying health 
of the economy.

<P>
Auburn basketball coach Sonny Smith reportedly is close to accepting the head 
coaching job at Virginia Commonwealth University with a multiyear contract 
worth about $300,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 52, who has been Auburn's coach for 11 years, said he will visit the VCU 
campus in Richmond today but denied a report that he already had agreed in 
principle to accept the job. 
</P>
<P>
The Birmingham News reported today that VCU officials and community leaders 
have put together a financial package worth more than $300,000 a year for five 
or six years. The package includes a $90,000 base salary, a radio and 
television contract worth $100,000 and more than $120,000 in other benefits 
including a home allowance, clothing allowance, two cars, stock options and a 
country club membership, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The VCU coaching job opened with the resignation of Mike Pollio at the close of 
the season. The VCU Rams were 66-58 during Pollio's four years, including 14-16 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's record at Auburn is 173-154, including one Southeastern Conference 
tournament championship and five straight appearances in the NCAA tournament, a 
period in which the Tigers' record was 101-58.

Anders Eklund of Sweden overcame a sixth-round knockdown to earn a decision 
Thursday night over Philip Brown of New Orleans and claim the vacant World 
Boxing Assn. Americanus heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a former sparring partner for former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, 
stunned Eklund with a looping right hand midway through the sixth round. He 
followed up with two more roundhouse rights, sending Eklund to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, however, did little else throughout the 12-round bout, throwing only 
four combinations before the sellout crowd of 1,000 at Harrah's Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Eklund, a 6-foot-6-inch, 253-pound European champion, jabbed weakly but was 
effective in throwing solid body shots. 
</P>
<P>
Eklund won handily on two cards. The third judge, Doug Tucker, scored the fight 
a 114-114 draw. Eklund improved to 18-4-1, while Brown dropped to 36-4. 
</P>
<P>
Eklund has signed to fight Italy's Guido Turne for the European heavyweight 
championship. The bout is scheduled May 10 in Helsinki.

Freshman Billy Owens had a career-high 27 points, and seventh-ranked Syracuse 
outscored Bucknell 36-8 at the end of the first half en route to a 104-81 
first-round victory today in the NCAA Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Syracuse, 28-7, meets the winner of the Florida-Colorado State 
game Sunday in Reunion Arena for the right to advance to next week's regional 
semifinals in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, only the third freshman in Syracuse history to reach the 400-point mark, 
had 23 of his points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
He was only three points short of the Syracuse record for a freshman set by 
Dwayne Washington in 1983, but he had scored no more than 19 points in any game 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Thompson added 21 points, All-American Sherman Douglas hit 19, and Matt 
Roe contributed 19 points, including four 3-pointers in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Butts led the Bison, 23-8, with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen had some early problems against 15th-seeded Bucknell, the East 
Coast Conference champions, before applying a killer full court press. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed 12 times in the first half before Syracuse clamped on the 
press and scored 36 of the first half's final 44 points for a 52-36 half-time 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bucknell closed to within 10 points in the second half, but Roe killed the 
rally with his 3-point shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse played without starting center Derrick Coleman, who sat out the game 
nursing a sore back and muscle spasms.
