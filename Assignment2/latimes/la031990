$10-MILLION LITTLE BOY; 
</P>
<P>

FROM TOP SPECIALISTS WHEN A NEW DIAGNOSTIC CENTER OPENS MARCH 26.

Richard Hall, the $10-million boy, doesn't pay much attention as the doctors 
seated in the auditorium at Ventura County Medical Center listen in awe to the 
story of his difficult, terribly expensive struggle against life-threatening 
birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Richard, after all, is only 6 and, as his father, Navy Lt. Bert A. Hall, puts 
it, "He's pretty much recovered by now. Mainly, we just have to watch him." 
</P>
<P>
Richard's story is one of a family's determination to save a child's life. It 
also helps illustrate the need for a center in Ventura County where seriously 
ill children can be diagnosed by top specialists from throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Such a facility will open March 26 -- the County Medical Center's Pediatric 
Diagnostic Center, at 3400 Loma Vista Road in Ventura, across the street from 
the medical center's main building. 
</P>
<P>
At least 18 pediatric specialists from the UCLA and USC medical schools, 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and other highly regarded universities and 
hospitals will visit the new center regularly to advise patients and their 
physicians. The visitors' expertise will include cardiology, allergies, plastic 
surgery, neurosurgery and child psychology. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 24, 1984, when Richard was born 10 weeks early at VCMC, no such program 
existed here. Richard, who could neither breathe nor take nourishment 
unassisted, had to travel thousands of miles, mainly to Los Angeles and San 
Diego, often for examinations that could have been conducted locally had the 
new center existed. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly, Richard had two things wrong with him," said his mother, Maria, 33, as 
the family was interviewed after a meeting with members of the hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
"First, he had a laryngeal cleft, or a hole in the voice box area. Second, the 
wall was missing that was supposed to separate his trachea and his esophagus. 
The trachea carries air to the lungs; the esophagus carries food to the 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we were through, he had to have 18 operations, mostly at Children's 
Hospital in San Diego. At first, the surgery was to keep him alive by inserting 
tubes in him. Later, there was a series of operations to repair the missing 
wall and cleft. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first two years, our medical bills totaled about $5 million. That's 
when we quit counting. Today, they must come to at least $10 million." Most of 
this, she said, was paid by the family's military health insurance. A state 
agency, California Children's Services, took care of the rest, sometimes by 
persuading doctors and hospitals to reduce their fees. 
</P>
<P>
Richard's father, Bert Hall, 39, an aircraft maintenance officer at Point Mugu 
Naval Air Station, where the family lives, said that, because of Richard's 
weakened lungs, he caught pneumonia about 50 times. 
</P>
<P>
"And about as often as that he quit breathing, and my wife and I had to bring 
him back with cardiopulmonary resuscitation," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, Hall said, neither he nor his wife got much sleep. "We stayed 
up all night listening for mucus to collect in Richard's throat. Sometimes it 
happened six times an hour. We'd rush in and clear it out with a little suction 
machine. If we didn't, he'd choke." 
</P>
<P>
Even Richard's brother, William, now 10, learned to use the suction device so 
he could lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Richard's primary treatment is medication prescribed by Dr. Christopher 
Landon, director of the new diagnostic center and head of pediatrics at VCMC. 
Richard has recovered to the point where he's in kindergarten at Laguna Vista 
Elementary School in Oxnard, where his brother, William, is a fourth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Landon was so eager to open the new diagnostic center -- it's in a 
3,000-square-foot building that formerly housed a physical therapy facility -- 
that he took out a personal loan to finance the center. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, the county will pay me back out of hospital bed fees," he said. 
"I'm not concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
Landon estimated that more than 10,000 children a year will be treated and 
diagnosed in the new center. A clinic that formerly served half as many 
patients is being phased out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Landon and the Halls credited a Navy pediatrician, Cmdr. Michael Hurwitz, with 
guiding the family through much of the maze of hospitals and specialists with 
which they dealt. For his part, Hurwitz, who is stationed at the Naval 
Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme, praised the Halls for being 
"marvelous -- and that includes William." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure," Hurwitz added, "the Halls would have been saved a great deal of 
travel, distress and risk if we'd had this new diagnostic center at the time. 
In a case like Richard's, you can do some consulting by phone, but the 
specialists really need to see the child in person."

LEERY OWNERS REOPEN SHOPS AFTER KILLING 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merchants nervously resumed business Sunday at a small shopping center in 
Oxnard where a man buying a soda was killed in a drive-by shooting that 
authorities said was Ventura County's first homicide this year. 
</P>
<P>
Rufino Ducler, 45, of Camarillo was shot once in the back Saturday in the 
parking lot of the busy shopping center near First Street and Rose Avenue, said 
Sgt. Denny Phillips of the Oxnard Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Ducler was pronounced dead at St. John's Regional Medical Center less than an 
hour after the 5 p.m. shooting in the Latino barrio, La Colonia. He was the 
first person in the county to be murdered this year, Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said that Ducler was not a gang member, but police have not ruled out 
the possibility that the gunmen may have been connected to a gang. Witnesses 
could not provide descriptions of the car or how many people were in it, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Ducler, who worked at a paper recycling company in Oxnard, "seems to be an 
innocent victim of circumstance, kind of the wrong place at the wrong time," 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the small parking lot where Ducler was shot has been the scene 
of drinking and brawling, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Only three hours after Ducler was shot, store clerks watched in fear as a fight 
erupted in the same lot. A window at the Ortiz Bakery was shot out, said bakery 
worker Juan Ortiz as he served customers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police may assign another patrol unit to the area if the violence continues, 
Phillips said. One unit patrols the area at present, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A clerk at one of the stores said Ducler was a frequent customer who stopped by 
Saturday to buy a soda. The clerk, who asked to be identified only as Virgie, 
said she is worried about the escalation of crime at the small stores in the 
center that cater primarily to neighborhood shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling you, it's scary, scary!" Virgie said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County law enforcement officials have said they are concerned about 
increased gang activity in the county, particularly in Oxnard. However, Oxnard 
police have repeatedly downplayed the city's gang problem, saying youth gangs 
that roam the city are different from the hard-core urban gangs that rule Los 
Angeles neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Oxnard hasn't really been gang-involved," Phillips said. "We have been very 
fortunate that we haven't had the gang problems that L.A. has." 
</P>
<P>
Shootings in Oxnard average about 10 a year and are down compared to last year, 
said Phillips, although he could not provide statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, stores bordering the parking lot were closed for two hours while 
police questioned witnesses after the shooting. As retailers resumed business 
Sunday, shops were abuzz with news of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"When they shot at that guy, I didn't think it was serious," said Rodrigo de la 
Paz, owner of Rodrigo's Market. De la Paz said he was serving customers when he 
heard four shots ring out and "saw the guy fall down right there in the corner 
outside." 
</P>
<P>
Another sales clerk said Sunday that the drive-by shooting and subsequent fight 
disrupted the shopping center and alarmed customers, but it was business as 
usual afterward. "I just continued with my job," he said. "It's all you can 
do."

CITIES TOLD TO JUSTIFY DEVELOPMENT OUTLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The financially strapped Ventura County government has called on all 10 cities 
in the county to justify their spending of redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
The county desperately needs tax money that is diverted to the cities to 
provide essential services, said Richard Wittenberg, county chief 
administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Redevelopment freezes the county money for 40 to 45 years," Wittenberg said. 
"I don't know that people understand what that does to the county services for 
mental health, welfare, the county hospital, the jail. It starves us." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, cities can declare neighborhoods blighted. That enables them 
to keep property taxes from new development that would otherwise go to 
counties, schools and the state. 
</P>
<P>
More than $12 million has been diverted from the county since 1985 through the 
cities' redevelopment practices, a county report found. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the county wants the cities to account for how they spend the 
20% of redevelopment tax money that the law requires them to set aside for 
affordable housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Oxnard, which have some of the 
largest redevelopment projects in the county, say their cities spend their 
redevelopment money responsibly to help develop housing programs for the 
elderly and low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Without redevelopment, it would have put a serious dent in our affordable 
housing program," said Jay Corey, Simi Valley's assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already put up $100,000 of money for homeless or low-income housing from 
our Ormond Beach redevelopment project," said Dennis Matthews, Oxnard 
redevelopment administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agencies have created their projects within the law and with 
the consent of the county, said Edward Johnduff, administrative services 
manager in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"The county has to balance its budget just like everybody else does," he said. 
"All the cities have to make tough choices." JOANNA MILLER

TEST DRIVE ENDS IN CAR THEFT AND CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old man was in jail Sunday after allegedly stealing a gold sports car 
that he had taken for a test drive, Simi Valley police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Sauer of Los Angeles was arrested Saturday after a high-speed chase and 
was held on suspicion of stealing a 1983 Datsun 280-ZX from a car dealer in 
Simi Valley, Sgt. Ron Lompart said. 
</P>
<P>
Sauer was taking a test drive with a salesman when he suddenly said he could no 
longer drive the vehicle, Lompart said. When the salesman got out to take 
Sauer's place in the driver's seat, Sauer allegedly drove away, Lompart said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, police saw the car heading east on the Simi Valley 
Freeway. After police were led on a high-speed chase, the car crashed near 
Yosemite Avenue, Lompart said. Sauer tried to run away and was captured, he 
said.

FBI BANK FRAUD PROBE CENTERS ON EX-OFFICIAL; 
</P>
<P>
EMPIRE: OLEN B. PHILLIPS -- AIRLINE PILOT, CHURCH OFFICIAL AND PHILANTHROPIST 
-- IS ALSO UNDER INVESTIGATION BY VENTURA COUNTY AND STATE AUTHORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olen B. Phillips, the son of a Texas sharecropper, built a multimillion-dollar 
real estate empire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties that paralleled the 
growth of the Ventura Freeway corridor in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
An airline captain, a bank director, a church official and a philanthropist, 
Phillips rose steadily to power as both a businessman and a civic leader in the 
Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village areas. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Phillips -- described by his minister as a genius and "one of the 
finest men I've ever known" -- faces widespread allegations of fraud and 
investigations by county, state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his real estate business, Phillips was a stockholder and one of 
the directors of the now-defunct United Community Bank of Thousand Oaks, the 
parent company of Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan of Westlake Village, which went 
out of business in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has learned that the FBI, which already has spent almost two years 
probing the involvement of Westlake Thrift in a massive phony loan scheme, is 
now investigating Phillips for possible bank fraud in connection with United 
Community Bank's role in Westlake's troubles. Phillips was also on the board of 
directors of Westlake Thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI will not confirm or deny an investigation of Phillips. Already 
convicted in a probe of Westlake Thrift is its former president, Steven Smith 
of Thousand Oaks, who last December pleaded guilty in federal court in Los 
Angeles to charges of conspiracy, fraud and misapplication of bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
On another front, however, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department says it is 
investigating the 50-year-old pilot, who lives in Westlake Village, on 
allegations that he defrauded investors in real-estate holdings he controlled. 
Many of the complaints under investigation were made by those who purchased 
"trust deeds," or gave Phillips cash loans in exchange for claims on property. 
</P>
<P>
County investigators are attempting to trace what happened to "at least $30 
million" in missing funds, according to Sheriff's Sgt. Pat Buckley. In many 
cases, Buckley said, the missing money represents the life savings of investors 
who knew Phillips personally and trusted him, or who had heard of his seemingly 
impeccable reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"This will probably be the largest fraud in this county's history," said 
Buckley, who estimated that as many as 2,000 investor-victims throughout 
Southern California may be involved. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those investigations, the California Banking Department recently 
concluded its own investigation of United Community Bank, which the state 
closed last December for lack of funds. That report has been forwarded to the 
Ventura County district attorney's office, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
State banking officials suspended Phillips from his duties at the bank and 
barred him from its premises in November. The bank's former chairman, Phil 
Chase, was also suspended by the state. The Times has learned that Chase is 
also under investigation by the FBI for possible bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Since his troubles began to mount, Phillips has avoided comment on the growing 
furor. On the advice of his attorneys, Phillips declined to speak with The 
Times. His attorneys also declined to comment, noting that no charges have been 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with Phillips' friends and associates, and court records, however, 
provide a portrait of an ambitious juggling act that led to success as well as 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
According to those interviewed, Phillips would fly for United Airlines, then 
return home to Westlake Village and his Agoura Hills-based company, Phillips 
Financial Group, to oversee dozens of limited partnerships and their plans to 
turn raw land into offices, homes and profits. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who are critical of Phillips today admired his ability to win 
investors' trust with an affable "country boy" style. 
</P>
<P>
"People were falling all over themselves to give him money," said one former 
client and employee, and others said that Phillips' job as an airline pilot 
enhanced his image as a stable, responsible businessman deserving of 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very soft-spoken," said another client. "Has a nice family, is a member 
of the Baptist church, a pillar of the community -- certainly the type you 
would trust." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips settled in the Conejo Valley in 1966, according to published accounts, 
and obtained his real estate license while a rookie pilot on stand-by 
schedules. He worked for a broker between flights and, in 1969, started his own 
business, Westoaks Realty, with fellow real estate agent Richard Principe. 
</P>
<P>
As the business grew into a top area firm, so did Phillips' prominence in the 
community, where most people called him "O.B." He was active in the Rotary 
Club, several sources said, and gave generously of his time and money to a 
variety of local charities. With his three children and wife, Caroline -- his 
high school sweetheart -- he attended church regularly, lending his expertise 
to First Baptist's building and finance committees. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was twice elected president of his denomination's statewide 
organization, the California Baptist Foundation, and he is a benefactor of 
California Baptist College in Riverside, according to the Rev. Ron Wilson, 
pastor of First Baptist Church of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about an upstanding citizen," said Wilson, who called Phillips 
"one of the finest men I've ever known." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and others described Phillips as a workaholic who lived well but not 
ostentatiously. He seemed to derive his pleasure from his family, from flying 
and from occasional trips up the coast in a recreational vehicle. A son of 
Texas sharecroppers, trained to fly in the military, Phillips never put on 
fancy airs and was equally considerate of men rich and poor, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Phillips and Principe ended their partnership amicably to run their 
own companies. The assets of Westoaks Realty were divided, and Phillips started 
the Phillips Financial Group. 
</P>
<P>
Observers marveled at how quickly Phillips re-established himself, setting up 
not just one firm to oversee a series of investment syndications but seven 
other companies to handle virtually every aspect of real estate development. 
Under the umbrella of the Phillips Financial Group, Phillips operated Boardwalk 
Escrow, HomesWest Realty, Phillips Property Management and Westlake Mortgage 
Inc., among other companies. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Phillips was flying wide-bodied jets for United, was serving on 
the board of United Community Bank and was active in his religious and civic 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the man's a genius," Wilson said. "To be able to do all the things 
he's done over the years, a normal person couldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
But, looking back at Phillips' business -- the headquarters of which, at 30101 
Agoura Court, was raided by sheriff's deputies Dec. 15 -- former clients and 
employees now say the "financial group" was poorly run in Phillips' absence. 
</P>
<P>
Lavish monthly breakfast meetings, which Phillips would lead with a prayer and 
a motivational speech, could not mask his apparent lack of involvement in 
day-to-day operations, said former employees. Nor could the daily inspirational 
sayings left on their desks quell fears that few if any of his companies were 
turning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"You were lucky if you got to talk to him, and then you got the impression he 
wasn't up on anything," one real estate agent said. 
</P>
<P>
That source and others said there was pressure to "cross-patronize" related 
subsidiaries -- urging condominium buyers to use Boardwalk Escrow and Westlake 
Mortgage, for example, or referring commercial tenants to Phillips Property 
Management. They also said there was pressure to recruit investors, either as 
limited partners or trust deed buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Those who gave Phillips money include fellow airline pilots, physicians, 
retirees, schoolteachers and Phillips' own church. As word of his troubles have 
spread, so have tales of financial ruin.

One Los Angeles policeman, a 38-year-old father of five, claims he may have 
lost $475,000 that was to have built his family a new home. The police officer, 
who asked not to be named, said he invested in four trust deeds last August, 
after the sale of his old house, because he was lured by promises of high 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
"My money will never go into anything but a bank," the officer promised himself 
recently, then added, "But I may never be in a situation to do that again 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of building another house and providing my family with some of the 
dreams I had, those are non-existent now until I get some money." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the allegations now surfacing against Phillips were foreshadowed in a 
Superior Court lawsuit filed by Principe last April, eight months before it was 
known that Phillips was under criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Principe, who remained a general partner with Phillips in several investment 
groups, claims in his suit that Phillips commingled funds among limited 
partnerships, failed to record trust deeds he issued to secure loans, borrowed 
money on behalf of partnerships without authorization and drove many into debt. 
</P>
<P>
Principe also claims that Phillips was evasive when asked questions and refused 
to provide full access to financial records -- the type of behavior that 
prompted other investors to contact the Sheriff's Department last summer and 
fall, according to Buckley and investors. Late interest payments and bounced 
checks also triggered complaints, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Principe's suit claims that, in one example of Phillips' alleged mismanagement, 
184 trust deeds totaling more than $3.4 million were not recorded with Ventura 
County for months -- and in some cases years -- after they were signed. 
</P>
<P>
As another example of possible mismanagement or fraud, Principe's suit also 
cites "unidentified accrued expenses in the amount of $222,257" on one Thousand 
Oaks property. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many holes and discrepancies between the records of the 
defendant, the title reports and the records of the plaintiff that it is 
virtually impossible to tell with any certainty at this time the financial 
condition of the partnerships," Principe claims in court papers filed earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' attorney, Richard M. Hoefflin of Encino, declined to discuss 
Principe's lawsuit or to comment on at least eight others that have been filed 
by other investors against Phillips since news broke of the Dec. 15 raid on his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence seized is so vast and so convoluted, Buckley said, that it could 
be months before any charges may be filed against Phillips or his company's 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"For many, it was shock, just absolute shock," Steven Rubinstein, executive 
director of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce, said of the raid. "To people 
involved in the financial market, some nodded their heads who felt he could 
have been overextended on the properties he had, plus his involvement in United 
Community Bank." 
</P>
<P>
"I would say over the years he's been responsible for the management of 50 or 
60 partnerships," said another area businessman, "and at least 90% of them 
closed out and gave returns equal to or better than projected. . . .That's why 
this was a surprise to everybody, because he'd done so well for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips still flies for United Airlines, but he returns home to a 
significantly scaled-down operation in a smaller office in Thousand Oaks. He 
has been voted out of at least two partnerships, according to court records, 
and his former headquarters on Agoura Road is the subject of a bankruptcy 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
He has been flying on a weekend schedule, Wilson said, "so he can spend most of 
his time during the week trying to sort out this business." 
</P>
<P>
Several investors said that they have spoken in person with Phillips, and that 
he has promised to straighten out a tangle of debts and paralyzed deals and 
repay as many people as possible. To that end, he recently retained the Santa 
Monica real estate firm of Kibel, Green, which specializes in salvaging 
troubled real estate ventures, a company official confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, expressing a faith in Phillips that some others have abandoned, 
predicted that the pilot will rise again. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do I think he'll be vindicated," said Wilson, "but, knowing him, I 
think he'll rebuild."

PAY THE MONEY, BUY THE LAND AND NAME IT HOPE

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whereas in the 1960s Mr. Bob Hope made substantial investments in land in the 
Santa Monica Mountains, 
</P>
<P>
Whereas much of these lands are sought after by the National Park Service by 
virtue of their ecological, wildlife and recreational value, and have been 
scheduled for acquisition and inclusion in the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area, 
</P>
<P>
Whereas due to recent budget restraints few funds have been available to 
purchase these lands, 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Mr. Hope at 86 understandably wishes to sell these lands by way of 
organizing his estate, 
</P>
<P>
Whereas these lands, if sold for development, would be lost forever to future 
generations for parkland use, 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Mr. Hope has charitable inclinations in other directions and is 
reluctant to simply donate his land as parkland, 
</P>
<P>
Whereas recent calls by environmentalists and others have cast an unreasonable 
slur on Mr. Hope's good name, 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Mr. Hope has provided valuable service to the Nation as an entertainer, 
particularly in his travels abroad during wartime to entertain the troops, and 
we recognize that the time has come to recognize this service, 
</P>
<P>
Therefore let all join in urging Congress to make a special appropriation from 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund with which to purchase for the Nation 
these Hope properties, and that some appropriate part of the land be named 
after Mr. Bob Hope.

BACK TO HIS MOONBEAM?; 
</P>
<P>
JERRY BROWN: SETBACKS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY INDICATE THAT HE HASN'T MADE THE 
TRANSITION TO NUTS-AND-BOLTS LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE SCOTT, Joe Scott is a Los Angeles political journalist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Party officials called it "cost-efficient," but the collapse of the California 
Democratic Party's highly touted voter-registration field operation, nurtured 
and pushed by state chairman Jerry Brown, raises new questions about the 
political future of the former governor. The operation was at the core of 
Brown's party revitalization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Its demise comes at a time when Democratic registration has slipped below 50% 
for the first time in 56 years. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Brown's bid to become party chairman worried that his charisma and 
fund-raising skills could never compensate for his weak administrative 
abilities. Could he really re-invent himself, they asked, as a nuts-and-bolts 
leader? 
</P>
<P>
Brown insisted that he could. So confident was he that he tied the success of 
his party-building efforts to his political ambitions. Just months ago, he was 
quoted as saying that his role had changed from "moonbeam to machine. We're no 
longer into metaphysics; we're into mechanics." 
</P>
<P>
But the abrupt end of the party's field program is a tacit admission by Brown 
that he badly miscalculated the price tag of remaking the party. With the 
operation's monthly payroll at $250,000 and with only $100,000 in the bank, 
Brown will have to settle for local registration drives partly funded with 
party cash. 
</P>
<P>
In a fund-raising letter last November, Brown said that the party needed to 
take greater responsibility for voter registration, voter identification and 
get-out-the-vote efforts. He bragged about a new campaign strategy used in a 
special congressional election in September. "We combined modern computer 
technology with old-fashioned grass-roots organizing." 
</P>
<P>
With the end of his field operation, Brown has lost his "machine." Metaphysics, 
anyone?

As "progress" makes its grim way through whatever remaining charm still exists

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REED JUNIOR HIGH WINS MATH CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For an unprecedented second year in a row, a team of students from Walter Reed 
Junior High School in North Hollywood has captured the state championship in a 
national mathematics contest. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Reed beat out teams from other California junior high schools to win the 
Mathcounts competition held Saturday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The second consecutive win by the Walter Reed team is a feat unmatched in the 
daylong contest's seven-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Coached by teacher William Fitz-Gibbons, the four students on the team were 
Eric Yeh, Anshul Amar, Daniel Kamins and Daniel Shell. Individual scores by 
Yeh, Amar and Kamins also ranked in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Fitz-Gibbons, who has coached the Walter Reed team since 1985, said the team 
never has placed lower than fifth in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Mathcounts is sponsored by the National Society of Professional Engineers to 
encourage students to study mathematics and become engineers. Individual 
students are ranked according to their performances in two rounds of written 
examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Team standings are determined by taking the average of individual scores and 
adding the result to the outcome of a final round in which the four team 
members work together to solve a series of problems. 
</P>
<P>
The top four individuals from Saturday's contest will form the California team, 
which will compete in national competitions May 18 in Washington. Fitz-Gibbons 
said this was the first year Walter Reed has not had a student on the 
California team.

NO NEED FOR SEPARATE TESTING; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY OF FRENCH ABORTION PILL ALREADY ESTABLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposal for separate California testing of RU 486, the abortion pill 
developed in France, misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
There already has been extensive testing in the state by the USC School of 
Medicine under federal regulation. International clinical trials also have 
supported the efficacy and safety of the drug. Its introduction in the United 
States is being delayed not by problems of regulation but by the absence of an 
application by the manufacturer or a qualified supplier. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, in making the proposal for state tests in 
conjunction with his campaign for governor, asked that state funds now 
earmarked for testing AIDS-related drugs be used. That seems both unnecessary 
and unwise. It is not needed, because there have already been controlled tests. 
It is unwise because it would divert limited resources from more urgently 
required tests. 
</P>
<P>
California is the only state that exercises its authority to approve drugs 
separately from the procedures of the Food and Drug Administration. This has 
been a practice for 50 years -- although narrowly applied, usually to test 
secondary uses of drugs already approved by the FDA. The program was broadened 
in 1987 when the Legislature provided funds to test drugs made within the state 
that are potentially useful in controlling the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) that causes AIDS. Three drugs are now being tested. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has handled its responsibilities for new drugs in an impressive fashion 
and there is no reason for California to sponsor separate approval mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
We regret that the distribution of RU 486 has been restricted to the nation of 
origin, France. We applaud the work done by the Population Council and USC in 
the California trials. They demonstrated the safety of the drug and its 
relative efficacy even when used alone and without the preferred combination 
with prostaglandins. But making RU 486 a political issue will not accelerate 
the introduction of this remarkable discovery to the American market. 
</P>
<P>
The need now is to find sponsors who will press forward with requests to the 
FDA for marketing approval. The FDA demonstrated its efficiency with its recent 
quick response to new findings about the usefulness of AZT in early 
intervention with those infected with HIV. But it cannot act without a formal 
request.

RAIDERS RETURN TO OAKLAND

<TEXT>
<P>
An open letter to Davis and the Raiders: 
</P>
<P>
So you're going home again -- bon voyage! But there seems to be some dissent on 
the part of the good people of Oakland, who decry the millions being spent to 
bring your football team there to the detriment of the serious civic problems 
of the homeless and schools. They do have a point. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want to make points with your local citizenry (other than those 
you rack up on the football field), how about contributing some of your revenue 
to really help Oakland cope with these problems and win yourselves some 
much-needed goodwill as well as more people to watch your team play? 
</P>

It's your ball now, first and 10.

A GAS TAX OR GR-R-R-RIDLOCK?; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 111 WOULD RELIEVE CONGESTION, IMPROVE FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some backers of Proposition 111 on the June 5 ballot fear that the gas-tax plan 
is so complex that voters may just decide to vote against it rather than take a 
chance on something they find confusing. That's all wrong. The effect of the 
proposition could not be simpler. A yes vote will gradually increase the state 
gasoline tax and finance a transportation system than can carry California into 
the future. A no vote would doom an incr- edibly wealthy nation-state of 29 
million people to more years of gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Consider just one example: Defeat of Proposition 111 would delay indefinitely 
the long-planned widening of Interstate 5, the Santa Ana Freeway, between the 
Garden Grove Freeway (22) and the Costa Mesa Freeway (55) in Orange County. The 
aging Santa Ana would just deteriorate more. The ultimate cost of the project 
would escalate because of inflated prices of materiel and land. Traffic, of 
course, would continue to choke itself to a virtual standstill. Imagine similar 
conditions on the Ventura, the Riverside and the Harbor freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Highway congestion is getting worse by an estimated 15% a year in the Los 
Angeles area. Without Proposition 111, additional crowding is expected to add 
as much as an hour a day to the average work commute during the decade. 
Rush-hour speed on the worst Los Angeles freeways could be down to 7 m.p.h. 
That's "speed"? Without Proposition 111, about all that can be expected is a 
valiant effort to keep maintenance at present levels. And that's not saying 
much. The condition of two-thirds of existing California highways is only 
"fair" ranging down to "very poor." 
</P>
<P>
Some anti-taxers have made a fuss about the doubling of the state gasoline tax. 
But at 9 cents per gallon, the levy now is virtually the lowest in the nation. 
California's per capita spending on roads is dead last. Washington state just 
voted to hike its gas tax to 22 cents. The boost to 18 cents in California 
would be stretched out over five years, bringing in a total of $18.5 billion 
for a variety of highway projects and other transportation measures that are 
vitally needed to ease the freeway burden. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the full tax rate, the fuel bill of the motorist who drives 15,000 
miles a year and averages 20 m.p.g. would increase by only a little more than 
$100. Right now, the average motorist loses $1,200 a year from delays, extra 
fuel and repairs to his vehicle as a result of the deplorable state of the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
The Proposition 111 gasoline-tax increase is a modest investment that will pay 
dividends to every Californian for decades to come.

GOVERNOR'S HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest your editorial "Housing Relief With the Two-Step" (March 
7). 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to bring to your attention the governor's housing proposal which would 
also assist in addressing the housing needs for moderate-income borrowers who 
do not qualify for current programs and cannot obtain a conventional loan. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposal is designed to make homeownership affordable to 
Californians by providing secondary financing available in the amount necessary 
to reduce either the principal or to lower the interest rate of the first loan 
to the point where an eligible buyer can afford to buy a home. The program will 
be administered by the California Housing Finance Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under the governor's proposal, first-time home buyers could purchase a home 
with a minimum 5% down payment. Debt service on the first loan would be a 
30-year fixed term at conventional rates. The second loan would accrue simple, 
below market rate interest and would not be payable until the first loan is 
repaid or upon sale or transfer of the property. The program is structured to 
provide an option of an interest rate buy down, a deferred second mortgage, or 
both in order to provide the most effective assistance to home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
This program would generate $1 billion in new mortgage capital for purchase and 
construction of housing in the high-cost areas of California. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that this program will provide homeownership opportunities for 
5,000 to 6,000 California families.

SHIRER'S BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In The Times' review of William L. Shirer's volume of memoirs (View, Jan. 17) 
and in a subsequent feature interview (Feb. 4), the author is guilty of 
rewriting the history of his departure from CBS News while maligning his 
friend, Edward R. Murrow. 
</P>
<P>
Shirer says he was relieved of his program of news analysis because views he 
voiced were thought to be too liberal and displeasing to his sponsor and that 
Murrow, then vice president of news and public affairs for the network, refused 
to defend him to CBS management. Shirer told his interviewer that he was unable 
to obtain work elsewhere in broadcasting because of a reputation as a leftist 
and was thus an early victim of McCarthyism. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that his departure from CBS predated the rise to power of the 
red-hunting senator from Wisconsin disposes of Shirer's claim to martyrdom 
quite aside from his innocence of being tainted by red-oriented commentary. 
It's largely forgotten now but in those days CBS News did not include 
commentary in its policy requirements. News analysis, as it was called, forbade 
the expression of opinion by its news broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Shirer's version of his break with the company portrays Murrow as a sellout 
heavy who did the corporation's dirty work in ridding it of an alleged 
fellow-traveler. The truth is something else. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of those reporters who were launched on broadcasting careers by the 
outbreak of World War II, Shirer was a print journalist who had to accommodate 
to the requirements of telling his story to a microphone. His broadcasting 
skills, voice quality and delivery, which always were marginal, had made him 
dull beyond survival once the high drama of what he was reporting or analyzing 
was scaled down by peace-time subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
In my own role at CBS in those years I had to listen to an unending stream of 
complaints from the sales department about the declining quality of the ratings 
in Shirer's time period. 
</P>
<P>
So it is sad beyond expression that he's never been able to believe that he 
found no takers after CBS -- not because of his views, but because he could no 
longer command a broadcast audience large enough for the requirements of 
broadcast commerce. That's bitter medicine for anyone -- and Shirer was not the 
first nor the last to swallow it. But to build an ego-sustaining version of 
what happened at the expense of seeking to throw discredit on the reputation of 
as old and close a friend as Murrow was to Shirer is sadder still. 
</P>
<P>
Your book reviewer appeared to think that Shirer had disclosed the feet of clay 
which underpinned Murrow's reputation, which he described as "mythic" among 
broadcast news people. Murrow's reputation needs no burnishing; it was and 
remains well-founded in his integrity and loyalty to those who worked for and 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
Shirer's misfortune was far more serious in our commercial society than being 
thought a "lefty." He had become unmarketable. A number of others in his craft 
subsequently discovered to be politically tainted were saved or rehabilitated.

DRUGS THE ABSTINENCE ERROR; 
</P>
<P>
DROP THE IRON FIST AND TRY RULES OF MODERATION; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURES THAT TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT DRINKING BUT FROWN ON ADULT DRUNKS HAVE 
LOWER RATES OF ALCOHOLISM. THE LESSON SHOULD TRANSLATE TO DRUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL TAVRIS, Carol Tavris is a social psychologist and author of Anger: The 
Misunderstood Emotion (Touchstone). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with the complexities of drug use, many people are tempted by simple 
formulas: Don't try to distinguish moderation from abuse; settle only for "zero 
tolerance." Don't separate illegal drugs that are beneficial from deadly ones; 
forbid them all. Don't let the kids have an ounce of wine; it will make them 
alcoholics. Just say no. 
</P>
<P>
The most ironic consequence of these efforts to rein in drug consumption is 
that they actually increase the chances of abuse. There are two reasons for 
this: Policies of abstinence do not teach how to use drugs in moderation; and 
by focusing on the drugs themselves, they ignore why people use them. 
</P>
<P>
For individuals and for society, such policies are mistakenly thought to be the 
best defense against abuse. In fact, the opposite is true. Lower rates of 
alcohol and drug abuse have been associated with approaches that emphasize 
moderation and education -- in which young people learn responsible use of 
alcohol and "social drugs" in controlled settings, with less potent forms of a 
drug and with information about the hazards of excess. 
</P>
<P>
Cultures in which people drink moderately with their meals -- and where 
children, in the presence of their parents, learn the social rules of drinking 
-- have much lower rates of alcoholism than those in which drinking occurs in 
bars, in binges, or mostly alone. Study after study has found that alcoholism 
is much more prevalent in societies that forbid children to drink but view 
adult drunkenness with amused tolerance or as a sign of masculinity (such as 
Ireland and the United States) than in cultures that teach children how to 
drink responsibly but frown on adult drunkenness (such as Italy and Greece). 
With other drugs, too, moderate use -- the Peruvian Indian custom of chewing 
coca leaves, the occasional use of marijuana for social and medical purposes -- 
does not lead to addiction or social problems. 
</P>
<P>
When a person tries any drug without knowing the rules for its use, he or she 
typically uses it stupidly -- the way teen-agers and college students binge on 
liquor, for instance. Prohibition was supposed to keep adolescents free from 
liquor's contaminating influence (a rationale of today's drug policies). 
Sociologist Joan McCord of Temple University has documented how this rationale 
backfired: Males who were teen-agers during Prohibition were later more likely 
to be problem drinkers and to commit many more crimes than men who were adults 
during that time. The former, never having learned how to drink, overdid it 
when given the opportunity later on. 
</P>
<P>
An individual's responses to a drug depend on his or her mental set -- 
expectations of what it will do and on what he or she wants it to do. Studies 
have shown, for example, that there is nothing intrinsic in alcohol or crack 
that makes consumers violent -- but violent, angry, frustrated individuals tend 
to be drawn to these drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the physical and social settings shape an individual's responses. A 
century ago in this country, marijuana was used as a mild sedative. Cocaine was 
widely touted as a cure for everything from toothaches to timidity. When 
cultural outsiders began using marijuana and cocaine for "mind-altering" 
purposes, society responded by making the drugs illegal. That was the first 
step toward making them major social problems. 
</P>
<P>
When an approach to a problem is repeatedly tried and repeatedly fails, it is 
time to experiment with alternatives. The alternative to prohibition and 
enforcement is not legalizing drugs and crossing our fingers. It is drug 
education, training in the moderate use of some drugs and continued social 
sanctions against abuse. 
</P>
<P>
What would a legalization and education program look like? Elements of it are 
apparent in the case of cigarettes. Cigarette smoking has significantly 
declined because of a combination of factors -- limits on advertising, rapidly 
changing social attitudes toward smoking and regulations restricting when and 
where people may smoke. As is the case with tobacco, legalizing marijuana, 
cocaine and heroin would not signify an endorsement of their use. Society could 
continue to prohibit drug abuse on the job, drug advertising and the use of 
narcotics while driving a motor vehicle or in certain public settings. 
</P>
<P>
But most important, as physician Andrew Weil observed years ago, legalizing 
drugs must be accompanied by real drug education on a widespread basis. "What 
passes for education today," he said, is "a thinly disguised attempt to scare 
people away from drugs we don't like by exaggerating their dangers." A more 
truthful program must avoid this hypocrisy. Children would learn that not all 
drugs are equally hazardous and that some illegal drugs are safer than legal 
ones. For example, marijuana has some important medical properties -- it 
lessens pain and reduces the swelling in glaucoma -- whereas tobacco poses 
unacceptably high health risks. The dangers of both alcohol and crack would be 
taught, and children would learn the positive reasons -- relaxation, 
meditation, socializing -- for moderate use. 
</P>
<P>
Education would also spotlight the risks of what Weil calls "problem sets" -- 
consuming drugs to alter bad moods -- and "problem settings" -- in which drug 
or alcohol abuse is compulsory. Lessons about moderation and "self-control" 
will depend on the reason a person drinks or abuses drugs in the first place. 
In order to pass for 21 in a bar? To join a fraternity or gang? To escape 
illiteracy or hopelessness? To quiet the despair of a dead-end life? 
</P>
<P>
Many people worry that legalizing drugs would mean that everyone would choose 
to be "high" all the time. Perhaps some would for a while, just as dieters 
sometimes binge on chocolate and involuntary teetotalers binged after 
Prohibition. And perhaps some people, like the sad, lost youths who inhabit the 
legal-drug parks of Europe, would give over their lives to pursuit of the 
constant high. There are costs to any policy decisions we make. But the 
evidence suggests that there will be fewer human, economic and social costs to 
a policy of legalization-and-education than to continued escalation of an 
unwinnable war.

NEGLECTED IN THE TALK OF LEGALIZATION IS WHAT IT WOULD DO TO GHETTO ECONOMIES.

By TERRY WILLIAMS, Terry Williams is a resident scholar at the Russell Sage 
Foundation in New York and author of The Cocaine Kids (Addison-Wesley), Growing 
Up Poor, with William Kornblum (Lexington) and The Crackhouse, to be published 
this year.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's midnight Thursday. A dank, dark crack house (a place where the drug is 
used, not sold) in Washington Heights. Julio and Skinner, two local dealers, 
sit at a corner table smoking a powerful blend of ganja and freebase. Others 
look on, thirsty for the smoke that spirals upward, then evaporates into the 
off-white walls. 
</P>
<P>
Julio and his teen-age apprentice are off work, eager to breathe the smoke they 
are forbidden when selling. They are low-level dealers making five, six 
"hunnert" (hundred dollars) a day selling "product" (crack cocaine). Julio has 
invested his money in a local head (drug paraphernalia) shop. His eldest 
brother has a car dealership. His family owns a disco bar in the Dominican 
Republic. Julio encourages Skinner to invest his money in legit businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner has other ideas: He wants to buy the gold chain he saw downtown and a 
new car just like the one driven by the dealers in the next block. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good to do that," Julio warns his young associate. "If you do that, 
every kid that sees you will want to do the same thing. It's not righteous, not 
politically chill (cool) to act this way." 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other inner-city youths and many adults, Julio and Skinner 
are cocaine capitalists. What cocaine does for inner-city economic life and 
what would replace it if drugs were legalized are rarely-discussed aspects of 
the multinational, multibillion-dollar drug business. Indeed, drug dealing 
offers powerful economic incentives for minorities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Cocaine is our World Bank, it is our product," Julio asserts. "Without 
cocaine, my family would starve. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the Colombians and the other Latino brothers are making money for 
their people. You can talk to the politicians in those countries and they tell 
you the reality is that the Escobars and the Ochoas are like folk heroes 
because they take the money and give it back to the people. Pablo Escobar has 
built homes for the poor in Medellin. Other big drug guys have used cocaine 
capital to boost the lives of the poor. This is more than the politicians can 
say." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, the drug trade made life livable, in spite of some of its 
devastating social costs, for tens of thousands of people who would not have 
benefited from trickle-down economics or enterprise zones even if they had 
worked. Where can a 14-year-old inner-city youngster find a job with an income 
of several hundred -- perhaps a thousand -- dollars a week? He can't. 
</P>
<P>
Legalizers beg the question of what would happen to people who depend on the 
drug trade for survival -- in other words, the loss of community income. Would 
the government replace this income with aid programs, jobs or entrepreneurial 
incentives? Would the pharmaceutical companies be the new beneficiaries of 
America's appetite for drugs? 
</P>
<P>
To ask these questions is not to condone the illegal lifestyles of drug-trade 
participants. Rather, it is to highlight the human complexities ignored by most 
legalization advocates. That same 14-year-old would be either using the legal 
drugs or selling to his friends who would be using them. 
</P>
<P>
In my investigations of the cocaine-kid culture during the past 15 years, I 
discovered that despite the cocaine trade's code of ethics that prohibits use 
of crack/freebase cocaine, it is clear that if not kids like Julio and Skinner, 
then others will find themselves -- after a few years -- using the drug not on 
off-days but every day. Instead of being dealers, they will be user/dealers 
and, eventually, just users. These are the kids who would constitute the ready 
market for legalized cocaine and other drugs. They are hooked. 
</P>
<P>
Legalization would give them the venue to continue on the road to 
self-destruction already set in motion by the lack of legitimate opportunities 
in the regular economy, proper mentoring by concerned adults, poverty and 
disillusionment. Many of the young people who got involved in the cocaine 
business in the 1980s (it is estimated that as many as 150,000 teen-agers in 
New York City alone were in the trade) did so because they recognized an 
opportunity -- one not forthcoming from the Reagan Administration and Congress 
when they cut job-training funding. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal opportunity emerged as a result of the drop in world kilo prices of 
cocaine. Everybody took advantage of it: former marijuana dealers, corrupt 
officials, heads of state, investment-banking houses, money launderers, 
law-enforcement bureaucracies, unemployed teen-age crews/gangs. These 
teen-agers became the cocaine kids, the stepchildren of a marriage between 
poverty's despair and the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
The adults in the drug trade, meanwhile, were struggling to find a small 
business in which to invest their cocaine dollars so they, too, could get a 
part of that dream. The irony, of course, is that this is "the American way." 
Various clans who made their way to legitimacy and respectability from illegal 
opportunities are the legendary families of which icons were made. 
</P>
<P>
But let us return to the crack house in Washington Heights. Two young women 
have joined Skinner and Julio. They sit smoking the "blizzard" (white smoke of 
crack-freebase) from three-pronged glass pipes. Joan, the cook, dispenses the 
drug in small dosages to the waiting crackheads. "I never want to see this drug 
legalized" she tells me. "I don't see what good it is to smoke this and have 
nothing else to do but look for something that ain't there (the habit of 
looking for crack particles, referred to as ghost-busting). I hate this drug -- 
but I love it. I've been on this pipe for seven long years and nothing is worse 
or better than my hit." 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old girl sharing the "high" with Joan lives in the crack house with 
four others; they have become her adopted family. Her real family she hasn't 
called in two years. T.Q. has prostituted herself, sold her "lips" for $20 and 
now refuses to have sex until she's seen "Scotty" (had her cocaine high). Now 
T.Q. is "bugging out" in a corner because she says she wants to kill herself 
every time she takes a hit. "I've been on the (George Washington) bridge three 
times with the pipe in my hand, and I keep saying I'm gonna do it one of these 
days. Why do I smoke? I must want to die." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of self-esteem, self-control and the guilt and confusion that come 
from the degradation depicted by T.Q.'s words are part of the real human cost, 
especially for young people. When poverty and lack of opportunity are added, 
drug legalization, whatever its form, would seem to be almost diabolical in its 
effect on the T.Q.s of America. It would be tantamount to denying the social 
conditions and values that lead to the quick-fix, artificial euphoria of drugs. 
To prescribe legalization is to mistake the symptom for the cause -- proof of a 
complicity among political and economic "doctors" not to probe too deeply but, 
by advancing drug legalization, to let the social disease spread.

<P>
Jennifer Capriati won easily Sunday, and so did Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, tennis' 13-year-old sensation, advanced to the fourth round when 
Patty Fendick sustained a knee injury while leading, 4-2, in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want to win like that," Capriati said. "I feel sorry for her. She was 
playing great, too." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-seeded Agassi, 19, who had a first-round bye, needed just 54 minutes 
to eliminate Kelly Jones in a second-round match, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In another men's match, qualifier Mark Kratzmann upset ninth-seeded Yannick 
Noah, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
In women's matches, No. 3 Monica Seles routed Laura Lapi, 6-1, 6-1, in 42 
minutes, and No. 4 Manuela Maleeva trounced Camille Benjamin, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, 8-1 since turning pro earlier this month, lost her serve at love in 
the second game and fell behind, 3-0. She was ahead, 30-0, in the seventh game 
with Fendick serving when the match ended. 
</P>
<P>
Fendick said her right knee locked as she hit a backhand approach shot. She 
stumbled while retreating for a Capriati lob and then collapsed along the 
baseline. 
</P>
<P>
After a trainer examined the injury, Fendick decided she couldn't continue and 
left the court with a bandage wrapped around her knee.

KINGS DON'T LOOK GREAT WITHOUT GRETZKY; 
</P>

HOCKEY: STAR PLAYER TO BE SENT HOME WITH STRAINED GROIN, BUT THE INJURY IS NOT 
CONSIDERED SERIOUS. FLYERS PULL AWAY IN THIRD PERIOD FOR 7-4 VICTORY.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings were hit with the four words they've always dreaded but never before 
heard Sunday: Injury to Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since he joined the team nearly two years ago, Gretzky was 
unable to play, sidelined for Sunday's 7-4 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers by a 
strain in the groin area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the injury is believed to be neither serious nor long-term, Gretzky 
was due to leave the team and fly home today for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
So he'll miss at least one more game, the finale to a five-game trip Tuesday 
night in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"If this had been a playoff game, he would have played," said King Coach Tom 
Webster. "He would have wanted to play. Let's put it at that. I'm sending him 
home because I don't want to take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky first felt the strain skating on mushy ice in Buffalo Wednesday. He 
aggravated it further Saturday in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he had arrived in Philadelphia Saturday night, he was limping. When 
Gretzky failed to respond to treatment Sunday morning, the decision was made to 
scratch the man many consider the greatest to ever play from the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
It might be cheaper for the Kings to set up a shuttle service to Los Angeles. 
Defenseman Tom Laidlaw was sent home earlier Sunday with a hip flexor. And 
teammate Keith Crowder was due to join him today, due to a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of those staying aren't in great shape. Center Mike Allison is down 
with food poisoning after eating bad shellfish in Boston. Defenseman Steve 
Duchesne took a puck in the Adam's apple Sunday, losing his voice, but no 
playing time. And right wing Bob Kudelski was knocked out of Sunday's game in 
the second period with a broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell," said Webster, "I'm going home, too." 
</P>
<P>
Just kidding, but Webster isn't too amused about seeing one of the Kings' 
brightest trips of the year take such a dark turn. 
</P>
<P>
After winning their fourth in a row Saturday, third on this trip, to clinch a 
playoff spot, the Kings, those still able to skate, were unable to maintain the 
recent momentum against the Flyers Sunday and sank to 32-35-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the opportunity, "to prove we have a well-rounded team," Marty McSorley 
said. "Wayne certainly makes us good, but we believed the other 19 guys could 
have won this game." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were in it until the third period, keeping the sellout Spectrum crowd 
of 17,423 in their seats despite the absence of Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
King goals by McSorley (13th), Mike Krushelnyski (15th) and Steve Kasper (17th) 
were balanced by the Flyers, who got two goals from Ron Sutter (20th and 21st) 
and one from Murray Baron (second), leaving the score tied 3-3 heading into the 
final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't stay that way long. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia scored three goals in a little over four minutes to put the game 
out of reach, Keith Acton (his ninth), Murray Craven (23rd) and Craig Berube 
(fourth) doing the honors. 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli banged in his 31st goal to bring the Kings a little closer, before 
Rick Tocchet closed out the evening's scoring with his 35th. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will get over the loss. There will be other games. 
</P>
<P>
There biggest concern was Sunday's other loss, because there's only one 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky has failed to appear in two games since joining the Kings, both 
last year, neither because of injury. He missed one because of his 
grandmother's funeral and the last game of the regular season because it was 
meaningless and the Kings wanted him rested for the playoffs. . . . The medical 
report wasn't totally bleak. Larry Robinson returned after missing six games 
and 12 pounds due to food poisoning. . . . With so many bodies missing, the 
Kings recalled left wing Craig Duncanson from their New Haven farm club. In 46 
games with New Haven, Duncanson had 17 goals and 25 assists. . . . Sidelined 
Flyers include goalie Ron Hextall (pulled groin), defenseman Mark Howe 
(herniated disk), both out indefinitely. Defenseman Kerry Huffman is day to day 
with a bruised right knee. . . . Strip tickets for all four rounds of the 
playoffs go on sale today at the Forum. Individual tickets for the first two 
rounds will be available Tuesday. Priority numbers will be distributed at 9 
a.m.. Limit is six tickets per person per game.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
Ready for an all-L.A. matchup in the NCAA finals -- UCLA vs. Loyola Marymount? 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Hey, why not? March Madness has never been more maddening. Nine of the top 16 
seeded teams were knocked out in the first two rounds. The Triple Terrors -- 
Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri of the Big Eight -- are gone. So are the Twin 
Towers -- Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo of Georgetown. And the defending 
champion -- Michigan -- is nowhere to be found after allowing 149 points in 40 
minutes. Representing the Hoosier state is not Indiana, Purdue or Notre Dame, 
but, instead, David Letterman's alma mater, Ball State . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's victory over Kansas eases the pain of a late-season slump and 1989-90 
must now be considered a success for the Bruins no matter what happens from 
here on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Against a disciplined team that boasted the most accurate passing attack 
outside the San Francisco 49ers', UCLA played some of its best defense in 
years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the thinking that Roy Williams would out-coach Jim Harrick. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson's stock in the NBA draft has soared. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Shocking stat of the day: UCLA, winner of 10 NCAA championships, is in the 
round of 16 for the first time in 10 years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount's rout of Michigan was a case of mind over matter and a 
tribute to Paul Westhead's full-speed ahead tactics. Some of the names change, 
but not the triple-figure scores. The funny thing is that Westhead was accused 
of coaching an offense that was too structured when a Laker player revolt 
forced him out Nov. 19, 1982. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In 25 years on the L.A. sports beat, I've never seen a better-conditioned team 
than Loyola Marymount. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up to Westhead for keeping Bo Kimble in the game Friday against New 
Mexico State after he drew his fourth foul in the first half. Some coaches will 
lift even a star player after he commits his second foul in the first half. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Kimble, who is 100%, should shoot all his free throws left-handed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the last year of its contract to televise early-round games, ESPN clearly 
outdid CBS. The cable network shifted from game to game, and you hardly missed 
a thing. In contrast, CBS stayed with lopsided games Saturday and Sunday and 
didn't even give the viewers frequent updates on upsets-in-the-making like 
Xavier over Georgetown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No referee works a fight better than Richard Steele, but he made a mistake 
Saturday night in Las Vegas when he stopped the Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick 
Taylor fight with only two seconds remaining. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I believe it is the responsibility of the referee to know approximately how 
much time is left in a round, especially when the red lights signaling that 
fewer than 10 seconds remain are blinking. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Even if Steele had allowed Taylor to continue, he wouldn't have gotten hit with 
another punch. The bell would have rung before Chavez could have reached him. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, here was a fight that exceeded its hype. Two well-conditioned warriors 
trading punches for nearly 12 full rounds. No clowning. No taunting. All 
business. . . .

NBA ROUNDUP;

<P>
BIRD FINALLY BACK IN FORM -- AND SO ARE CELTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It took three-quarters of the season, but Larry Bird is almost all the way 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, doing it all except making three-point baskets, is driving the Boston 
Celtics toward the title in the Atlantic Division. The way they are playing, 
the Celtics may be the only Eastern team capable of challenging the NBA 
champion Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Bird capped a sensational week with a triple-double Sunday at Boston to lead 
the Celtics to a 122-106 victory over New Jersey that moved them to within a 
game of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, who was slow to regain his shooting touch after missing most of last 
season because of foot surgery, had 29 points, 18 rebounds and 11 assists. He 
was 13 for 13 from the foul line, leading the Celtics to a perfect 33 for 33 in 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
It was the NBA's second-best team performance for foul shooting. In 1982, Utah 
was 39 for 39 in a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, trailing New York and Philadelphia, have shaken the doldrums 
mainly because of Bird. 
</P>
<P>
In four games over the past six days, he scored 118 points (29.5 average), had 
47 rebounds and 36 assists. He has been shooting only 47.1% from the field, but 
in two-point attempts, he was 43 for 73 (59%) in the four games. 
</P>
<P>
In three-point shots, Bird missed the two he took and was just two for 10 for 
the week. The all-time three-point scoring leader, Bird is shooting only 30% 
from that distance this season. 
</P>
<P>
After the teams traded baskets to open the game, a 14-0 Boston run put the Nets 
in a hole and they never got out, losing their 20th in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics welcomed back Robert Parish, who missed three games with a 
hyper-extended right knee. Parish played 17 minutes. In the veteran center's 
absence, Joe Kleine played extremely well and is sure to see much action in the 
stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
But Bird is the key. Early in the season he complained about not being allowed 
to work out of the low post. Now he doesn't want to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I seem to be getting my shooting touch back and we are starting to play 
better," Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 121, Golden State 116 -- The Warriors needed this one to keep their 
playoff hopes alive. They built a 10-point lead in the first half at Oakland, 
but couldn't handle Dale Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, playing only his fifth game after missing 27 because of broken ribs 
suffered in an automobile accident, came off the bench to score 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, in the eighth and final playoff spot in the West, moved four 
games ahead of the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
With a 33-31 record, the Sonics also are 2 1/2 games ahead of ninth-place 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 114, Dallas 84 -- It's getting so easy for the Pistons that they're 
having trouble maintaining their concentration. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, unbeaten in March and a loser only once in February, built a 
19-point lead in the second quarter at Auburn Hills, Mich. and coasted to their 
11th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, 9-0 this month, have won 24 of their last 25. Their only defeat 
since Jan. 21 was a 112-103 loss at Atlanta Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the streak there were some close calls, but not lately. Last week they 
routed Chicago by 25 and San Antonio by 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Piston defense held the Mavericks to 16 points in the first quarter and 17 
in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Starters Dennis Rodman and Isiah Thomas didn't reach double figures, but the 
other three starters and four reserves did. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 120, Orlando 103 -- A year ago at this time, the Cavaliers were ahead 
of the Detroit Pistons. But they were beginning to falter, and by playoff time, 
they weren't good enough to beat Chicago in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they'll do an about-face this season. Off to a slow start, the Cavaliers 
are rolling now. 
</P>
<P>
With Brad Daugherty scoring 29 points and Mark Price 25 at Orlando, the 
Cavaliers rolled to their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 109, Houston 96 -- Clyde Drexler scored four of his 21 points during a 
16-0 run in the third quarter at Portland that broke open a close game and gave 
the Trail Blazers their ninth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Despite 28 points and 15 rebounds from Akeem Olajuwon, the Rockets' road record 
fell to 7-27. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 103, Minnesota 98 -- Alex English, in and out of Coach Doug Moe's 
doghouse, emerged again in this game at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
English scored 27 points and the Nuggets moved closer to a playoff berth. The 
Nuggets are in seventh place in the West. DAN HAFNER

DEES WINS, FUELS U.S. TO VICTORY IN INDOOR MEET

<P>
Tony Dees equaled the second-fastest time of the year in the 60-meter high 
hurdles, leading the United States to victory over Britain and the Soviet Union 
in an indoor track and field meet Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Dees' time of 7.46 seconds matched Greg Foster's mark and was three-hundredths 
of a second off the year's best of 7.43 by Britain's Colin Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson didn't compete Sunday because of a hip injury and Dees took advantage. 
He led from the first hurdle in his final indoor race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to run that fast because I've been off for three weeks," Dees 
said. "I only started training again when I got here. I strained my hamstring 
in our national championships." 
</P>
<P>
Dees, who has beaten Foster and two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom this 
season, said the indoor season was merely a stepping stone to his 1990 goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I want Roger's 110-meter outdoor world record," Dees said. "Beating them all 
is no big thing now. It seems like everyone is trying to get a world record, 
and I'm part of that plan." 
</P>
<P>
Dees' performance was the highlight of a low-key meet the Americans won with 
121 points. Britain had 100, and the Soviet Union, using mostly 
second-stringers, had 93. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson, two-time national collegiate champion from Baylor, was upset 
in the 200-meter dash by Britain's Marcus Adam, but was satisfied with his 
second-place time of 21.19. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not disappointed," Johnson said. "The climax of my season was the national 
championships and the NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I just came over to have a good time, but I feel like I did my best. Had I 
been in another lane, I may have run a faster time. Lane two gave me a lot of 
trouble on the first turn." 
</P>
<P>
Guy Kochel, coach of the U.S. team, said of Dees and Johnson: "Barring injury, 
you're going to see great things from both of them. And not just those two. Our 
youngsters will be as good as what we've had in the past." 
</P>
<P>
The proof, he said, will come at the Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we are doing this year is preparation for the 1992 Olympics," 
Kochel said. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic 100-meter silver medalist Linford Christie of Britain ended his indoor 
season by winning the 60-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
Christie, who missed the record by one-hundredth of a second at Athens 
recently, suffered a stomach illness Saturday and decided to run only at the 
last minute. After three false starts by other sprinters, Christie was timed in 
6.59, nine-hundredths of a second off the record. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd even make it to the track," Christie said. "But the public 
paid a lot of money to watch me run."

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
RANGERS INCH CLOSER TO PATRICK DIVISION CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five or six teams in the NHL will probably have a better record this season, 
but frankly, the New York Rangers don't care. 
</P>
<P>
They are on the verge of winning their first division title since before most 
of their fans were born. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Janssens set up two of the three first-period goals that sent the Rangers 
on their way to a 5-2 victory over the Vancouver Canucks Sunday night at New 
York. The Rangers, with just six games to play, lead the Patrick Division by 
eight points. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 57 years since the Rangers won a division. In the 1932-33 season, 
when there were eight teams in the NHL, the Rangers won the American Division. 
They also won the Stanley Cup that season. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers are 8-3-1 in their last 12 games. In a division in which no other 
team is above .500, that is really a hot streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks, eliminated from the playoffs, have won only two of the last 21 
games they have played in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the way we came back after the poor performance yesterday," Coach 
Roger Neilson said. "But we're not ready to claim anything. Don't forget, the 
Devils (second-place New Jersey) have two more games to play than we do. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel that if we play in the rest of the games the way we did tonight, we 
can win the division." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers outshot the Canucks, 41-24, and dominated the game except for a 
brief time in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Defenseman Phil Housley's second goal of the game and 
his 20th of the season came at 2:03 of overtime at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-earned victory enabled the Sabres to become the second team in the 
league to win 40 games this season. Unfortunately, the first, Boston, is in the 
same division and is five points ahead of the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 2, New York Islanders 2 -- Both of these teams needed the victory in 
bids to reach the playoffs, but a point in this game at Uniondale, N.Y., wasn't 
too bad for the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
Since Mario Lemieux was lost for the season, the Penguins have not won on the 
road. They are 0-8-2 without him. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins pulled even on defenseman Paul Coffey's goal before the fourth 
minute of the second period and kept the pressure on the rest of the game, but 
couldn't break the tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins are third in the Patrick Division with 70 points. Washington has 
69, the Islanders 68 and Philadelphia 65. Two teams in the division will not 
make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 8, Quebec 3 -- Russ Courtnall scored twice in a six-goal first period 
at Montreal that enabled the Canadiens to stretch their best streak of the 
season to six unbeaten games. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens still have hopes of finishing second in the Adams Division, which 
would give them home ice in the first round of the playoffs. They trail 
second-place Buffalo by only a point. 
</P>
<P>
The hapless Nordiques are 12-54-7. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 3, Edmonton 1 -- Dean Evason came out of the penalty box just in time 
to skate to the net and bang in the tie-breaking goal in the third period at 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Bill Ranford stopped Dave Tippett's shot, but the rebound came right 
back to Evason and he fired the puck between the goalie's legs at 6:25. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, Minnesota 3 -- Dino Ciccarelli had a goal and two assists at 
Bloomington, Minn., and the Capitals held off a late rally. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled the Capitals to slip into fourth place in the tight battle 
for playoff spots in the Patrick Division. DAN HAFNER

CALLOWAY TAPS ORIGINAL HEPCATS FOR JAZZ REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To catch a Cab, call him early. Most days, Calloway, 82, the man who helped put 
New York's Cotton Club on the map in the '30s, heads out for Aqueduct, the Long 
Island race track where he pursues his life's passion: betting on 
thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
However, this weekend Calloway pulls himself away from the track to make his 
only Southern California appearances in this year's version of "Gotta Sing, 
Gotta Dance," an elaborate review of jazz and tap dancing from the '20s and 
'30s. Shows will be Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights at the Civic Theater in 
downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Calloway and a huge supporting cast, show producer Donald Wolfe has 
lured the Nicholas Brothers (Harold and Fayard), the tap dancers who worked the 
Cotton Club with Calloway in the '30s. In San Diego, the brothers will take the 
stage with Calloway for the first time since they performed with him in the 
1941 film "Stormy Weather." 
</P>
<P>
Talking by phone from his home in White Plains, N.Y., Calloway said he never 
grows tired of entertaining people. 
</P>
<P>
"Audiences are beautiful, I love 'em. They're all good." 
</P>
<P>
Calloway first hit it big in 1930, when four shady mobsters cornered him one 
night at the Crazy Cat in New York City, where he had a steady gig. They sat 
him down and informed him he was moving his act to the Cotton Club, where they 
upped his salary from $100 to $200 a week. 
</P>
<P>
As the club's No. 1 band leader, Duke Ellington, became busy with other 
commitments, Calloway took over his starring role. 
</P>
<P>
A whole generation of hepcats were weaned on Calloway's famous 
"Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho" chant with audiences during the song "Minnie the 
Moocher." Calloway also wrote or collaborated on dozens of the best-known swing 
jazz hits of the '30s and '40s, tunes such as "Three Swings and Out," "I Like 
Music Played with a Swing Like This," "The Jumpin' Jive" and "Are You Hep to 
the Jive?" 
</P>
<P>
The titles barely capture the flavor of hepcat '30s language, which Calloway 
helped create. His "Prof. Cab Calloway's Swingformation Bureau," a swing 
handbook published in 1939, introduced American squares to such hepcat 
musicians as Satchmo, Bix and Bojangles, and such early jive talk as, 
"Greetings, gate, let's dissipate." 
</P>
<P>
"Gotta Swing, Gotta Dance" was dreamed up by Donald Wolfe, a Los Angeles 
scriptwriter and film editor who actually began assembling the show in the late 
'50s, though he didn't know it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to work at Warner Brothers with a guy whose father was one of 
Ellington's managers. He had all these Big Band charts, and he knew I was 
interested in music. I bought them from him at a bargain price. Eventually, I 
assembled a large collection of original Paul Whiteman material," Wolfe said, 
referring to the legendary Big Band leader. "Now I've got a garage full of 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Wolfe, a fan but not a musician, wanted to hear his charts played 
live. 
</P>
<P>
"I put together a collection of L.A. musicians who knew the styling of that 
period, which is difficult to duplicate. Some of the guys had the old 
instruments: the C melody sax, the bass sax. These were younger guys who 
somehow got into that era. It sounded great." 
</P>
<P>
During the '80s, the group began playing clubs and private parties for 
corporations like General Motors. From there, it was just another step to 
large, glamorous halls like the Ordway Theatre in St. Paul, Minn. The band, 
known as the Rhythm Kings, sold out its last show there two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the band was joined by many other performers, until it became a 
revue almost as elaborate as the fantastic stage productions presented in the 
'30s at the Cotton Club, where the bandstand was a replica of a southern 
mansion and black entertainers played for mostly white audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Wolfe cornered Calloway backstage at the Vine St. Bar &amp; 
Grill in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I started talking to him. He liked what we were doing, and we presented a 
concert at UCLA on the Fourth of July. He had been coming out of retirement on 
his own. Now that he's out, he doesn't want to stop." 
</P>
<P>
As a special guest, Wolfe has roped dancer Betsy Baytos, a dancer who practices 
"Legomania" as taught by "Wizard of Oz" scarecrow Ray Bolger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that rubber-legged style, and she's probably the last practitioner," 
Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
Also featured are the Hotcha Hoofers, the revue's resident dance troupe, and 
the Gingersnaps, a group of spry, dancing grandmothers, all Broadway 
chorus-kick veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance" includes a lot of swing from Wolfe's original 
Whiteman and Ellington charts, but the two-hour show climaxes with Calloway 
leading a 15- to 20-minute medley, including "Hi-De-Ho" before the Nicholas 
Brothers' dance a "Tap Challenge" and Calloway joins them again on stage during 
"Fascinatin' Rhythm" and "I've Got Rhythm," the final two numbers. 
</P>
<P>
After being barnstormed by interviewers for 60 years, Calloway doesn't 
volunteer much information. 
</P>
<P>
His musical tastes? He said he has some 2,000 CDs, and mentions one by young 
jazz trumpet phenom Wynton Marsalis, plus "a classical thing I heard last 
night, made over in Vienna: flute, bass, piano, violin, cello." 
</P>
<P>
What does he have to say about the "Hepster's Dictionary" he wrote in 1944? 
</P>
<P>
"That was the beginning of rap." 
</P>
<P>
Does he laugh when he sees young entertainers struttin' their stuff, using 
words like "chick" and "gimme some skin" as though they were just invented? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. None of that jazz the kids go for is new. It's all been done before." 
</P>
<P>
Did musicians really talk jive as defined in his dictionary and "Swingformation 
Bureau?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh sure." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to reveal his secret to a long and happy life, he said, "I don't know. I 
couldn't answer that. I'm normal like everybody else, and I do normal things." 
</P>
<P>
There are a few million jazz fans who wouldn't necessarily agree.

A convicted drunk driver from Southern California was apparently strangled in 
his San Quentin prison cell, the Marin County coroner said. A preliminary 
autopsy on Alfredo Hidalgo, 44, a Filipino immigrant from Carson, indicated 
strangulation was the cause of death, Dr. Ervin Jindrich said. Toxicology tests 
to confirm the finding may take several weeks, he said.

"California needs a diaper change," state Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) told 
reporters at Sacramento's Shalom School, which welcomes infants who wear cloth 
diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Killea announced legislation that would require manufacturers of disposable 
diapers to warn consumers that the diapers are contributing to the nation's 
garbage crisis. Saying 26% of the 266 California child-care centers she 
surveyed refuse to accept infants who use cloth diapers, she added that her 
bill also would prohibit "diaper discrimination" at child-care centers. 
"Single-use throwaway diapers represent the most significant consumer item 
entering our landfills today," she said.

Pregnant women who are barred from jobs or housing because they are carrying a 
child can now file discrimination complaints with the state under a bill signed 
into law by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The measure authorizes the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing to 
accept complaints of discrimination against pregnant women. Pregnant women in 
California file about 600 complaints of alleged discrimination each year, said 
Lisa Ramer, an aide to state Sen. Nicholas C. Petris, the Oakland Democrat who 
carried the bill through the Legislature. The new law does not take effect 
until Jan. 1, 1991, but the fair employment and housing department agreed last 
December to implement the measure and hear complaints from pregnant woman.

PEOPLE: STEINLE TO LEAVE UPI TO START A MEDIA FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Steinle, who directed a major reorganization of United Press International 
for the past 25 months, will resign as president of the news service on March 
31 to start a media company. 
</P>
<P>
UPI Vice Chairman Joseph Taussig will assume the additional duties of president 
until a replacement is selected for Steinle, 51, Taussig said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the rebuilding process in which everyone in this company has 
participated during the past two years, I am confident that UPI will continue 
to grow and prosper," Steinle said in a message to employees. 
</P>
<P>
UPI reported a "modest" profit in the fourth quarter of 1989, Taussig said, 
after the news agency endured millions of dollars in losses over three decades. 
He declined to release financial figures. 
</P>
<P>
Steinle said he will remain on the UPI board. 
</P>
<P>
A Vietnam War radio correspondent and former president of Financial News 
Network, Steinle took the helm at UPI in February, 1988, after New York-based 
Infotechnology assumed control of the beleaguered company from Mexican media 
baron Mario Vazquez Rana.

AARP May Close Credit Union: Industry sources say the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons may close its 2-year-old credit union, which many bankers had feared 
would grow to be a formidable competitor. 
</P>
<P>
The credit union opened in May, 1988, with great fanfare. By drawing on the 
association's 30 million members, the institution was expected to quickly 
become the largest credit union and an aggressive marketer of consumer 
financial services nationwide. However, growth has been slower than expected. 
In addition, the AARP Federal Credit Union has come under fire from its peers, 
who see its untraditional makeup as a political liability in their fight to 
preserve credit unions' tax advantages.

IN SOUTHERN ISLAND PROVINCE, CHINA'S ECONOMIC REFORMS ARE STILL ALIVE;

HAIKOU, China 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong entrepreneur L. K. Sun, showing expensive, computer-controlled 
printing equipment to a visitor, waxed enthusiastic about his business 
prospects here. 
</P>
<P>
"The population of China is very large," Sun said. "If everyone buys one post 
card, it's incredible!" 
</P>
<P>
Sun's vision is centuries old, dating back to British traders who dreamed in 
vain of selling textiles to a limitless Chinese market. These days, among those 
familiar with the myriad difficulties of doing business in China, such ideas 
are usually mentioned only as a joke about unrealistic newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in silent testimony to just how quick failure can be when a market is 
misjudged is the Lone Star Cafe, located on a prime site in downtown Haikou, 
capital of the southern island province of Hainan. 
</P>
<P>
The cafe, which was set up with American money and specialized in fried 
chicken, shut down in January, just three months after opening. A former Lone 
Star customer said he believed that the investors had underestimated the 
Hainanese preference for seafood. 
</P>
<P>
But Sun, the Shanghai-born owner of Hong Kong-based Wing Foong Printing &amp; 
Paper Products Ltd., seems to know what he's doing. And he is no foolish 
beginner. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Hainan, the newest of five "special economic zones" where Beijing 
allows great leeway for capitalist practices and market forces, Sun has just 
set up a modern printing plant, his third joint venture in China. His first two 
plants, he said, are profitably churning out 30 million 10-card sets of post 
cards a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We see an opportunity to make money and to help Hainan solve its packaging 
problems," Sun said. "The Chinese side has done quite a lot to make things 
convenient, and we've brought over technicians, technology, capital, management 
methods and connections with foreign customers." 
</P>
<P>
Sun's joint venture, Hainan Nan Feng Printing &amp; Manufacturing Ltd., has two 
major customers just down the street: export-oriented shoe manufacturers to 
which it sells boxes. One shoe firm has Taiwan investment and the other is 
funded from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Since last June's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing, 
political uncertainty plus tight credit and reimposed central controls have 
chilled many Westerners' interest in investing in China. But the 
outward-looking coastal areas of South China continue to attract major 
investment, especially from entrepreneurs like Sun who are based in Hong Kong 
or Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
This is partly because the signals emanating from Beijing have not been 
entirely negative. While insisting that the socialist system must not be 
dismantled, the rhetoric still backs "opening" to the world and "deepening" of 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
China's special economic zones, of which Hainan is the newest and the largest, 
were set up to pioneer the decade-old reform effort. Since last summer, there 
has been some reassertion of central authority over the freewheeling southern 
provinces and special economic zones. 
</P>
<P>
When Hainan's reform-minded former governor, Liang Xiang, was fired last 
September on corruption charges, it was widely believed that the real reason 
was that he was too aggressive a reformist and too close to former Communist 
Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. Zhao, who had been China's most powerful 
advocate of rapid reform, was ousted in June after refusing to endorse the use 
of troops to crush the pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
But China's leaders, including hard-line Premier Li Peng, have recently 
reaffirmed support for the zones. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Fulin, an official handling economic policies in Hainan, said in a recent 
interview that the provincial government is still fully committed to reform. By 
carrying out "rectification" measures, Chi said, Hainan is not turning its back 
on reform but laying the basis for more effective development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of the government properly controlling the things that it should 
control, under the conditions of a market economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In your country, the tax system is very strict. If you don't pay, it's 
illegal. But here, lots of tax is never paid. In your country, companies are 
audited. Here we don't have the ability to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Chi said that since June, Beijing has not revoked any of the special favors 
granted Hainan when it became a province and a "special economic zone" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that in the stricter post-June political environment, 
the province has run into difficulties with ministries issuing orders that deny 
Hainan some freedoms it is supposed to have. 
</P>
<P>
By way of example, Chi said that customs authorities, operating under 
instructions issued by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, 
have restricted imports into Hainan in ways that contradict policy laid down by 
the Communist Party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Chi explained that ministries, in issuing nationwide policies, sometimes fail 
to note that exceptions apply to China's special economic zones. Zone leaders 
often need to remind officials to write in exceptions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The principal effect on Hainan of the nationwide austerity policies adopted in 
late 1988, Chi said, is that "this makes it harder to get capital for 
investment in Hainan, and it also creates some difficulties in selling our 
products. For example, the price of sugar has dropped, and bananas are not 
selling well." 
</P>
<P>
China aims to industrialize the north coast of Hainan and develop tourism in 
the south. Such cash crops as rubber, sugar cane and spices are also a key part 
of the island's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial development is now based on the processing of agricultural raw 
materials. The Haikou Canning Factory, for example, produced 20,000 tons of 
canned coconut drink last year, plus 4,000 tons of canned pineapple and a 
variety of other products. About half of its coconut drink production is 
exported. 
</P>
<P>
Hainan, along with the other special economic zones, has escaped the brunt of 
the central government's austerity drive. The program of tight credit and 
controls on spending cut inflation almost to zero in the final months of 1989, 
but it also pushed the nation to the edge of recession, and government leaders 
have said recently that this policy will be eased. 
</P>
<P>
China's total economy grew at 4% in 1989, with industrial output up 8%, both 
figures the lowest since the early 1980s. The five special economic zones -- 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen and Hainan -- showed at least 30% growth in 
industrial output, according to official statistics. This strength was fueled 
largely by foreign investment, which in the 1980s totaled $4.1 billion in the 
five zones. 
</P>
<P>
In Hainan, officials are promoting plans for new port facilities on the 
island's northwest coast at Yangpu harbor, and development of an adjacent 
industrial area aimed at attracting billions of dollars in investment. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to develop Yangpu quickly because many investors in Hong Kong and 
Japan are paying attention to the Yangpu project," Chi said. 
</P>
<P>
While Hainan, with a population of 6 million, is still for the most part a 
rural, underdeveloped tropical island, officials hope that relaxed trade and 
financial policies plus low wage rates will enable it to compete for foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
"Workers here earn about 200 yuan ($42) a month," said Sun, the Hong Kong 
entrepreneur. "This is pretty good for a young worker in China, but it's far 
less than in South Korea or Taiwan. Labor costs in Taiwan are at least 20 times 
higher than in Hainan." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who rushed to Hainan two years ago, in the heyday of high hopes 
for rapid reform, acknowledge that change has been slower than they wished. But 
compared to politically repressed Beijing, where there is still widespread 
anger over the June massacre, Hainan is an outpost of good cheer and optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, things have not reached the level of openness we were hoping for," 
said Zhang Chunchang, 38, an official of the Haikou Canning Factory. "But the 
level of reform and openness here is higher than in other places in the 
country. So we're satisfied. We can only compare it to the mainland, not to 
America. Also, openness and reform are the trend of world events and the demand 
of the people. No one can block this." 
</P>
<P>

JAPANESE SAVE MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER NATION

<P>
The average Japanese family had stashed away $86,250 in savings as of 1989, 
confirming Japan's place as one of the world's most frugal countries, the 
government has announced. 
</P>
<P>
The average family added 15.3% to its already large nest egg in 1989, the 
highest growth rate since 1979, the Management and Coordination Agency reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has complained in trade negotiations that Japan's high 
savings rate is a contributing factor to the massive U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan, which stood at $49 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's household savings rate, or the percentage of annual income an average 
family puts into savings, stood at 15.1% in 1989, one of the highest in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Americans saved on average only 6.3% of their income in 1989. 
The British saved 4.9%, and French and West Germans saved about 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The household savings rate does not include the value of the family home or 
other real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans argue the Japanese tendency to save a large portion of their 
income keeps their spending down. The result is they buy fewer goods, including 
imported goods from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have turned the argument around, saying the United States could 
improve its economic situation if it saved more. 
</P>
<P>
They argue a high savings rate makes more money available for investments and 
drives interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
Both countries have listed savings rates as a structural barrier to balanced 
trade in the ongoing trade negotiations dubbed the Structural Impediments 
Initiative.

GOOD CITIZEN TAKES HIS FIND TO DEPUTIES, HAS THEM SCURRYING 
</P>

<P>
There it was, shiny and new and free for the taking: an expensive-looking 
leather briefcase, lying in a Castaic dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
And when retired handyman Irving Greenhouse spotted it Saturday, he figured it 
would bring top dollar at the hospital thrift store where he works as a 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
But after Greenhouse, 73, showed his prize to the manager of his nearby mobile 
home park, the man told him he had a problem on his hands: the briefcase was 
stuffed with explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse got a similar reaction Sunday morning when he showed up with the 
case unannounced at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department station in 
Valencia. A sergeant took one look inside the case in the trunk of Greenhouse's 
car and ordered most of his co-workers into the basement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to Monday-morning quarterback, and he's a very nice man . . . but I 
wouldn't have touched it," Sgt. David Stunson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ron Moya of the sheriff's bomb squad said the explosives -- 20 strips of 
rubberized material similar to plastic explosives, plus two coils of detonating 
cord -- were "relatively stable" and posed little threat. 
</P>
<P>
Moya said officers were trying to determine who owned the material, often used 
in the aerospace and high-tech industries. He said it is being stored as 
evidence in a magazine at the Peter Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic and will 
be detonated later. 
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse said he was scavenging for aluminum cans when he found the 
briefcase. The dumpster is in a field off the Old Road near Parker Road, 
surrounded by homes, some of which are as close as 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse's arrival at the station touched off a "quite hectic" scene as 
deputies rushed to cordon off the street and a nearby parking lot and to herd 
other station personnel into the basement, Moya said. 
</P>
<P>
"At least he didn't dump it off somewhere else," Moya said. "He probably should 
have called us first. . . . But being a good citizen, he brought it to the 
station."

HIT-RUN DRIVER SOUGHT IN CRASH THAT KILLED 2 GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities were searching Sunday for the driver of a car involved in a fiery 
crash in which two young girls were killed this weekend on the Foothill Freeway 
in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
The girls were napping in the back seat of a car that had stalled by the 
freeway's center divider near Mountain Avenue on Saturday evening, authorities 
said. While one of two adults sought help, the car was struck from behind by a 
vehicle traveling about 90 m.p.h., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
While the two cars became engulfed in flames, the driver of the second car fled 
on foot, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Ferrer, 12, and Shannon White, 10, were killed. Elena's father, Antonio 
Ferrer, 50, was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital after he was pulled from 
the driver's seat of his car by a passer-by. He was listed in critical but 
stable condition Sunday evening after being treated for bruises and burns, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities found spilled beer and two empty cans in the wreckage of the 
hit-and-run driver's car, CHP Officer Michael Schwab said. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much to explain why the driver was traveling so fast in the 
marked-off area of the freeway," Schwab said. But he added, "The driving 
pattern and the evidence indicate that he was drinking." 
</P>
<P>
The hit-and-run driver was injured and left a trail of blood as he fled into a 
residential neighborhood north of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrer had taken his daughter, his friend, Elicio Briones, 51, of Azusa, and 
Briones' niece, Shannon, to a picnic at Santa Anita Racetrack sponsored by the 
bottled water company that employs Ferrer. The group was returning to Ferrer's 
home in Hawthorne when his car developed engine trouble, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of moderate traffic on the freeway, Antonio Ferrer worried about the 
girls being able to cross lanes safely on foot, said Elena's aunt, Doris 
Panopio. With the children already napping, he thought it would be best to wait 
in the car while Briones went for help, Panopio said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 relatives and friends gathered at the family's home Sunday afternoon 
and quietly described Elena in the present tense. They said that, among Antonio 
Ferrer's five daughters and one son, "she is his favorite." 
</P>
<P>
"Elena is the baby of the family," the girl's sister-in-law, Ruby Ferrer, 22, 
said. "She is like his pet. Wherever he goes, he takes her."

REP. HAWKINS SETS OFF POLITICAL SCRAMBLE; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGNS: ASSEMBLYWOMAN WATERS APPEARS A CINCH TO SUCCEED RETIREE. HER SEAT IS 
UP FOR GRABS IN HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within minutes of the surprise announcement six weeks ago that U.S. Rep. 
Augustus Hawkins would retire after 28 years in office, telephones began 
jangling across southern Los Angeles County. It was the sound of long-tended 
political networks cranking up for business. 
</P>
<P>
But not for a battle over the Los Angeles Democrat's congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) set her sights on Hawkins' job 
years ago, and her prolific fund raising and local popularity has scared off 
any serious competition. In leap-frog fashion, Hawkins' departure instead has 
opened the race for Waters' Assembly seat and ended a lengthy logjam that has 
so frustrated the Los Angeles area's black political community. 
</P>
<P>
Four Democrats, including Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell and former 
Los Angeles Community College trustee Marguerite Archie-Hudson, are vying to 
replace Waters. A Republican and a Libertarian -- whose very presence in the 
84% Democratic district defines optimism -- have also joined the race. 
</P>
<P>
The contest is expected to usher in the first significant political movement in 
the black community since a City Council seat opened up in 1987 and Nate Holden 
triumphed over a host of competitors. Before that, there had been little 
movement for years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been this gridlock that's existed for so long in the community," said 
Kerman Maddox, a former aide to Mayor Tom Bradley who is considering a run for 
Farrell's council seat next year. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Assembly race, he said, "Whether they're with Bob, Marguerite 
-- a lot of people are excited by the prospect of a real aggressive campaign 
and a good contest." 
</P>
<P>
And for this district, the June primary is the contest. The 48th Assembly 
district is the most Democratic in the state. It spreads across South-Central 
Los Angeles, South Gate and Lynwood with a population that is about 50% black 
and 37% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"For all intents and purposes, the Democratic primary is the election," said 
Rod Wright, one of the four Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
So far, despite an eagerness born of years of stifled ambitions, the 
competitors have been gearing up quietly. The candidates say they are tussling 
with the logistics of a campaign -- renting headquarters, ordering telephones, 
raising money -- and hoping to bolt into public view in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of caught a lot of people by surprise," Wright said. "It's not as 
though people were standing around in January with money in the bank and 
waiting for people to retire. . . . People are literally having to start from 
scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Local powers are beginning to array around favorite candidates. Bradley has 
endorsed Farrell, and individual labor officials also are rallying around him. 
A formal endorsement by organized labor, however, has not been made. 
</P>
<P>
Bondie Gambrell, a prominent businessman who has raised money for Bradley, 
Jesse Jackson and New York Mayor David Dinkins, will be host of a benefit for 
Archie-Hudson on March 25. Gambrell said she should collect up to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important endorsements will be those by Waters and her close 
ally, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), a traditional source of 
campaign funds for those who meet with his favor. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors continue to fly about the duo's intentions. Many within the black 
political community expect Waters to back Archie-Hudson -- or, less likely, 
Wright. Few expect her to remove herself from the race, despite her 
simultaneous congressional effort. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever accused Maxine of ducking a fight and I doubt that this is one 
she'll miss," said Wright, a former Waters aide. 
</P>
<P>
Waters, uncharacteristically coy, has offered no timetable for an announcement 
other than to say, "I hope to do it very soon." 
</P>
<P>
The assemblywoman's endorsement would by no means assure success. Four years 
ago, her effort to prod her son, Edward K. Waters, to victory in the 54th 
Assembly District backfired. But this year's endorsement would come in the very 
district that elected her with almost 85% of the vote just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The person who receives (Waters' endorsement) will be blessed with a very 
positive boost to their campaign," said local public relations consultant Larry 
Irvin, a former Bradley aide. 
</P>
<P>
There is little dispute about the issues most pressing to the district, because 
they are those that have dominated urban politics for decades -- crime, drugs, 
gangs, education, health care, jobs, housing, insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
For Farrell, the most prominent of the contenders, the race provides a chance 
to move up without risking his council seat. Farrell, 52, is closing out the 
third year of four-year term in a district that overlaps the 48th. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it is what is called in the business a free ride," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell has been the 8th District councilman since 1974, when he won a special 
election for the job. But his tenure has been rocky. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Farrell defeated an effort to recall him. Two years ago, organizers of 
a second recall fell short of the signatures they needed to put the issue 
before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
But Farrell remains well known in the South-Central area, an attribute that is 
even more important given the short period of time before the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Well-known in the past -- but likely to see some opposition from organized 
labor this time around -- is Archie-Hudson, who was appointed to the community 
college board in 1978 and won two successive terms before she was defeated 
three years ago on the strength of teachers' union opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Archie-Hudson, a former aide to Assembly Speaker Brown, had Waters' support in 
her earlier campaigns. Publicly, she has downplayed the role that endorsements 
by the powerful Democrats would play in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, the district is going to have to choose," said 
Archie-Hudson, currently the director of research and retention at UCLA's 
College of Letters and Science. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's presence in the race illustrates the intertwined nature of black 
politics in the Los Angeles area. He was Waters' administrative assistant and 
worked on her campaigns and those of other black politicians such as Bradley, 
state Sen. Diane Watson, Assemblywoman Gwen Moore and Councilman Gilbert 
Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 37, also has managed the campaigns of one competitor -- Archie-Hudson 
-- and worked for the election of another, Farrell. A governmental affairs 
consultant, Wright said he decided to jump into the 48th Assembly District race 
because the opportunities for political advancement in predominantly black 
areas are rare. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do you not know when (the next opening) will be, you don't know where 
you'll be when it does happen," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
If Farrell and Archie-Hudson -- and to some extent Wright -- are attracting 
Establishment support, Lynwood City Councilwoman Evelyn Wells is waging what 
amounts to guerrilla warfare from the eastern side of the district. 
</P>
<P>
The two-term councilwoman plans to question the credentials of her competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem I have with all of them is which ones have really been 
involved in the community and really know the concerns of the community?" asked 
Wells, 43, who works as a financial supervisor for the Lynwood Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
While she is less prominent than Farrell or Archie-Hudson, Wells' chances would 
seem good compared to those of Republican Gloria Salazar and Libertarian Jose 
Castaneda, both of whom are unknown politically and are battling the district's 
overwhelmingly Democratic nature. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, a 40-year-old employee of the Lynwood Unified School District who is 
making her first bid for elective office, remains optimistic despite the paltry 
9.8% GOP registration in the district. She said she hopes to win crossover 
votes from Democratic Latinas. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I'm a community person, I felt this would be good for me," she said of 
her effort. 
</P>
<P>
Like Wells, Salazar's base is in the eastern area of the district. Because she 
has no primary opposition, Salazar said she probably will concentrate her 
efforts in the summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
An even longer shot, if similarly unperturbed by the odds, is Castaneda, a 
30-year-old Jack-in-the-Box manager from South Gate who is making his second 
bid for the Assembly seat. In 1986, he won 1,360 votes as the Libertarian 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I did pretty good," he said. And his chances this time? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're pretty good."

University of Maryland surgeons say they have performed what they believe is 
the nation's first gallbladder surgery using only a local anesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
The patient, a 32-year-old opera singer who did not want a general anesthetic 
for fear of damage to her vocal cords, had gallbladder surgery recently by an 
incision through her navel. 
</P>
<P>
University surgeons have had success with the operation, performing about 100 
of the procedures since October, but had never before completed the operation 
with only local anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said most patients with problems such as gallstones could have the 
surgery in an ambulatory setting and be discharged the same day. Surgeons use a 
laparascope, a tube with a tiny lens on one end and a miniature video camera at 
the other end, to puncture the abdomen and reach the gallbladder.

APPROACHING THE END OF THE WORLD ON A HAPPIER NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN KONNER, M.D., Konner teaches medical anthropology at Emory 
University. His column appears in the Science/Medicine pages every other week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How do you write an upbeat column about the end of the world? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question I asked myself as I looked over the 1990 volume of the 
"State of the World" series, which recently came across my desk. The book, 
which is produced annually out of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, might 
just as well be called the "End of the World." It tells all about such trends 
as destruction of the ozone, deforestation, global warming, rising oceans, 
spreading deserts and a human population choking on its own wants and wastes. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard it all before, and your eyes glaze over, just like mine, but 
Lester Brown and his people at Worldwatch keep tabs on things. They rub their 
noses in these dismal statistics, so the rest of us can read the funnies and go 
to the movies. But every so often we have to pay attention to what they are 
saying -- once a year at least, when they lift their heads from the columns of 
numbers and global maps to tell us where we stand. 
</P>
<P>
So what was that about writing an upbeat column? The fact is, this volume of 
the "State of the World" devotes more space to the end of the end of the world 
-- the prospect for stabilization -- than any previous one. Brown and his 
colleagues picture a stable world in the year 2030, 40 years from now. If we 
don't do it by then, they say, we won't ever be able to. Tailspin city. It's 
doable, but it won't be automatic; it depends on people. 
</P>
<P>
They envision the world in 2030 as one in which the total human population is 
slowly declining, having topped out at 8 billion (declines had begun in various 
European countries before 1990; by the year 2000, although population growth 
continues, the number of births begins to decline for the first time.) Solar 
thermal power -- sunshine trained by a magnifying glass to heat a steam turbine 
-- generates vast amounts of electricity (back in 1990, it was already cheaper 
than nuclear power from new plants), and most houses are covered with 
photovoltaic shingles. Ranchers have so much to gain by farming wind instead of 
wrangling that they send their dogies off to the last roundup under the sleek 
shadows of windmills. 
</P>
<P>
The smog-spewing automobile has ended its brief career (barely a century) as 
the dominant mode of transportation. More people work and shop at home through 
computer networks, and bicycles have proliferated, keeping us in shape as they 
fight urban smog. Recycling of resources, efficient energy use -- we still 
drive sometimes, of course, but the cars get 100 miles to the gallon -- and a 
fashionable reversal of conspicuous consumption all combine to reverse the 
worst ecological trends of 1990. Poor countries are still struggling to feed 
their people, but there is hope on the horizon, and that grotesque waste of the 
20th Century, which endlessly poured precious resources into weapons of 
destruction, is finally seen for the folly that it was. 
</P>
<P>
Can we do it? It's far from certain, friends and fellow travelers on Spaceship 
Earth, especially considering the current state of the world. Don't be fooled 
by some recent scientific arguments. Global warming is controversial, sure, but 
not that controversial; experts argue about whether it's going to be 4 or 10 
degrees Fahrenheit hotter over the next 100 years, but all agree it's 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
In the same time period, oceans may rise as little as half a meter or as much 
as 3 1/2 meters, but ultimately, rising sea levels will turn all coastal 
nations into Hollands, and many of us will be like the boy with his finger in 
the dike. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pollution is not being controlled in a serious way in most 
countries. Lakes are being acidified throughout the world and, in some urban 
centers, the majority of infants have unacceptable blood levels of lead. 
Life-giving forests are being destroyed at a prodigious rate, along with 
hundreds of irreplaceable species of plants and animals. Dissipation of our one 
and only ozone layer continues, inviting dangerous levels of ultraviolet 
radiation. What was in the early '80s a hopeful picture of grain production per 
capita -- seemingly adequate worldwide, for the first time in history -- was 
clouded in the last few years as new mouths more than consumed the surplus. 
Meanwhile, back at the baby ranch, the production of additional humans will 
increase from an average of 84 million a year in the '80s to 96 million a year 
in the '90s. Practically all of them will someday watch television, and so will 
demand more from life even as they are forced to accept less. 
</P>
<P>
But consider this: Three days of global military spending could fund the 
Tropical Forest Action Plan for five years; two days could fund the annual cost 
of the U.N. Action Plan to halt desertification. The political will is there in 
many countries, but in most, actual policy has not yet changed. 
</P>
<P>
Almost four-fifths of our species has been born since World War II. As one of 
the oldest of that group -- it now hurts my elbows to read -- I feel as if I 
should exercise some leadership. So get out there on April 22 -- Earth Day, 
1990, the 20th anniversary of the first such political action -- and do 
something for your grandchildren. Chant yourself silly until those two 
so-called environmental Presidents, Bush and Gorbachev (not to mention the 
Japanese, who haven't even gotten their public relations in order), start to 
get serious about the fate of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the personal effort too: I know it's a drag to recycle, but folks, 
we have to stop using the garden as a toilet. It would be pretty ironic if we 
finally drew back from the brink of nuclear war, only to find a slower but 
equally sure way of killing ourselves.

COMEDY AS PAIN RELIEVER TESTED

Researchers will try to determine if laughter really is the best medicine by 
showing comic films to about 150 nursing home residents in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
The study will use films such as those by the Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields to 
see whether humor reduces requests for nonprescription pain medication, said 
Fran McGuire, head of the project. 
</P>
<P>
A small-scale film study two years ago found what appeared to be "dramatic 
decreases" in requests for pain medication, he said. That could have been the 
result of chemical changes in the body relieving pain or the result of reduced 
stress, which would reduce pain. 
</P>
<P>
However, McGuire said that study was so limited that no conclusive findings 
could be documented. The new study will attempt to broaden the scope and come 
up with findings that could be used by nursing homes to improve their 
residents' quality of life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to classic comic movies, Clemson researchers will use the "I Love 
Lucy" and Three Stooges television shows, said Rosangela Boyd, who tested films 
at a nursing home in Seneca, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"They did not find modern comedies, such as 'Three Men and a Baby,' to be funny 
nor did they like any of the films with offensive language," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire said he suspects classic films are preferred because they may bring 
back good memories. Also, slapstick humor can be enjoyed without having to 
follow a plot or understand nuances of dialogue.

HERPES RELIEF CLAIMED FOR DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Finnish skin specialist said last week that he and other researchers had 
successfully tested a drug that gave considerable relief to sufferers from both 
strains of herpes. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Lassus said researchers outside Finland found the drug, Genivir, also 
relieved virulent skin rashes in patients with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had tested the preparation in the form of a cream on 200 patients 
with genital herpes and 60 with common herpes and found it reduced the length 
of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The herpes virus can appear in the form of painful cold sores on the lips, in 
the eyes or on the genitals. There are two strains, both incurable, one of 
which is a sexually transmitted disease commonly known as genital herpes. 
</P>
<P>
"It reduced lip herpes episodes from the usual 10 days to just over five days 
and genital herpes from seven days to 3 1/2 days," Lassus said. The compound 
had an antiviral and immunological effect.

MUDD PLAYS IT SAFE, WINDS UP WITH TITLE;

When Jodie Mudd approached the par-three 17th hole Sunday at the Players 
Championship, he had reason to be nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, when he was completing the third round that was shortened 
because of rain Saturday, his tee shot bounced off the island green and into 
the water. He wound up with a double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
At the 17th, he was protecting a one-stroke lead over Mark Calcavecchia, who 
had birdied the 15th and 16th holes. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia's tee shot found the green and he got a par from 30 feet. Nervous 
or not, Mudd made a 10-foot putt for a birdie at 17, and then bogeyed the 
par-four 18th before Calcavecchia made par. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd, a two-time Public Links champion, earned $270,000 and a 10-year exemption 
from qualifying for PGA tour-sponsored events. He had a final-round 69, three 
under par, and 278 for the tournament, 10 under. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia finished at 279, matching Mudd's 69. It was his third consecutive 
second-place finish and his fourth this season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I called home to my wife, Sheryl, in Minnesota, she said, 'Hello, Mr. 
Second Place,' " Calcavecchia said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he earned $162,000 and is the leading money winner on the tour for the 
year, totaling $551,040 even though he hasn't won a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The 17th hole at the Tournament Players Club in Sawgrass was pivotal. A par 
three surrounded by water, it claimed many victims in the four days of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Blackmar got a 10 there; Roger Maltbie had a nine and then withdrew. 
Earlier Sunday, Robert Gamez, a tour rookie, took an 11 and Tom Watson faded 
from contention with an eight. The pin was in a hazardous position Sunday. It 
was placed to the back and right side of the green, only about 15 feet from a 
bulkhead and the water below. 
</P>
<P>
"After Jodie hit his shot, I went over to him and said, 'Tell me you pushed 
it,' " Calcavecchia said. "He's a great player, but he's not that good." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was only one down and I couldn't put it in the water at that point," 
Calcavecchia said. "I pulled the tee shot about five feet, but it was basically 
a good shot." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Calcavecchia came close to making birdie on the hole, his putt sliding 
three feet past the cup. He settled for par. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd, 29, who got his third victory in his eight years on the tour, was asked 
to describe his emotions when he approached the 17th. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept saying, 'You've got 145 yards. It's a nine-iron shot and just hit 
to the middle of the green,' " Mudd said. "If Mark wants to try to make a 
birdie, then let him be the aggressor, because I still had a one-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a good swing, pushed it a little bit and it went right to the flag. 
Then, I thought to myself if I could make this putt it would give me a two-shot 
cushion. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Mark would try to make birdie on the 18th." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, who is also 29, had no other option. He said he he crushed a 
three wood down the left side of the fairway, but safely away from water that 
borders the hole on the left. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd's drive found the right rough and he had a sidehill lie with a tree in 
front of him. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a real respectable second shot," Mudd said. "I had about 170 yards to 
the front of the green. I had to aim the ball to the water, cut it and roll it 
up on the green and it was the only shot I had other than to layup. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a five iron and executed it properly, but when the ball hit front of 
the green it stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia said he didn't hit a nine-iron hard enough for his second shot and 
he was 30 feet below the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd's third shot was only 18 feet short of the cup and he two putted for his 
bogey, the winning putt a one-foot tap in after Calcavecchia two putted. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't believe I won this tournament," said Mudd, a quiet spoken pro 
from Louisville, Ky. "The way my game is it just doesn't lend itself to this 
golf course." 
</P>
<P>
Mudd had a one shot lead over Calcavecchia and Green after completing the 
rain-delayed third round in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd never lost his lead, and was three strokes ahead of Calcavecchia and Green 
after nine holes. 
</P>
<P>
The players didn't complain about the hard, bumpy greens Sunday, saying that 
Saturday's rain enabled the balls to hold better on the putting surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd, an easy going sort, didn't complain at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up playing public courses," he said, "so I know all about bumpy 
greens." 
</P>
<P>
So he proved. As for Calcavecchia, the British Open champion, he has his 
tour-leading earnings to console him.

MELDRICK TAYLOR'S CLAIM IS PROVED WRONG BY TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The men who say they have Meldrick Taylor's best interests at heart called a 
news conference Sunday to convince the boxing world that their man was cheated 
Saturday night against Julio Cesar Chavez. Instead, they wound up proving the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Dan Duva, co-managers Lou Duva and Shelly Finkel, and Taylor himself 
-- after being discharged from a Las Vegas hospital after spending the night -- 
tried to talk their way to the victory that Chavez snatched from Taylor with a 
dramatic, last-second technical knockout when he was hopelessly behind on 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, doctors had an injury report on Taylor that could have been the 
result of a car accident, and the chief physician of the Nevada State Athletic 
Commission said if it were up to him, Taylor would still be in a hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hell of a way to lose a fight," Lou Duva said. "We were winning the 
fight for 11 rounds, two minutes and 58 seconds. Then the referee took it away 
from us." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly. What really happened was Taylor, leading by seven- and five-point 
margins on two cards, got nailed by a Chavez right with 26 seconds left. He was 
hurt, but dug in to trade punches once more. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor had thrown more than 1,100 punches in the fight and landed 457 -- about 
200 more than Chavez. But only Chavez's last punch really mattered, a 
thunderous right that caught Taylor flush on the jaw with slightly more than 10 
seconds left in the bout. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor dropped on his back in a neutral corner, and referee Richard Steele 
began the count. Taylor used the ropes to pull himself up at six, but sagged 
backward into the corner post, supporting himself with his arms on the ropes. 
At eight, Steele asked if he was OK. Taylor did not respond, but instead looked 
at his corner, where Lou Duva was climbing into the ring. In that moment's 
hesitation, Steele waved the bout over. There were two seconds left in the 
bout. 
</P>
<P>
"No way in hell he should have stopped the fight," said Taylor, who lost his 
140-pound International Boxing Federation title to Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe (Steele) would do a thing like that in a fight of this 
magnitude. If I have to lose, I would have liked to lose being knocked out, not 
able to get up. I was winning. It's ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor -- who showed up 90 minutes late for a 10 a.m. news conference 
Sunday because doctors were advising him against checking out of Valley 
Hospital -- was a badly beaten and injured fighter. Although the damage was 
masked by dark glasses and a small bandage on his cheekbone, Chavez's fists had 
taken a terrible toll. 
</P>
<P>
There was a "blowout fracture" of the orbital bones surrounding the left eye, a 
lacerated lip that caused him to lose and swallow two pints of blood, bleeding 
in his kidneys and dehydration. Taylor was placed on a stretcher and taken to 
the hospital by ambulance. He was given fluids and blood transfusions at the 
hospital, and took a CAT-scan to check for brain damage. The state boxing 
commission suspended him for 90 days for medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Taylor, the Duvas and Finkel continued to insist that a terrible 
injustice had been done. Taylor had fought a masterful fight for 11 rounds and 
had even outslugged Chavez for much of the 10th. But he also was tiring badly 
late in the fight, and the vision in his left eye was diminishing with each 
round. When asked afterward to recount the final seconds of the bout, Taylor 
said, "(Steele)) didn't say anything to me. He didn't ask, 'Are you OK,' count, 
or give me no kind of directions. I nodded my head, 'I'm OK, I'm OK.' And he 
still stopped it." 
</P>
<P>
But repeated viewings of the videotape -- which Taylor had not seen -- reveal 
that Steele did indeed count and ask Taylor if he was OK. And Taylor did not 
respond, either verbally or with gestures, until after Steele waved the bout 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Although after the fight Chavez spoke of giving Taylor a rematch, promoter Don 
King is said to be working on a Chavez-Hector Camacho bout.

HE HELPS WITH DEGREES OF DIFFICULTY; 
</P>
<P>
ACADEMICS: CHARLES WHITE HAS A NEW ROLE FOR USC AS COLLEGES BRING ATHLETES BACK 
TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
During almost any interview with a professional athlete, the dialogue can be 
expected to include: 
</P>
<P>
Reporter: When you finished school, did you have your degree? 
</P>
<P>
Athlete: No, I've got one semester left. 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that the world of sports is a world of dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL could just as well be the National Dropout League. And the NBA is truly 
the National Dropout Assn. In most sports, athletes have lately been leaving 
college earlier than ever -- and USC has decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
It has hired Charles White as an assistant to the athletic director with a 
mandate to reach out and haul back as many former Trojan athletes as he can get 
to complete their education. 
</P>
<P>
Charles White? Isn't he the 1979 Heisman Trophy winner, the former Trojan, the 
former Ram? 
</P>
<P>
Isn't he a college dropout himself? 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes. 
</P>
<P>
It may be, as they say, that it takes one to know one. In any event, White, who 
returned to the Trojan classroom this winter, is already dickering with Vince 
Evans, Anthony Davis, Bill Bain, Kevin Williams, Steve Obradovich and other 
former Trojan stars to come back, too. 
</P>
<P>
White's job is to identify those interested, encourage them to return and find 
a place for them in communications classes, business school or wherever they 
hung out long ago, between practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to think we were too busy to get a degree," White said the other day 
at his campus office in Heritage Hall. "Most of us aren't that busy now, and 
we've learned that hardly any honor is more worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"A college degree isn't everything, of course, but it leads most guys to a lot 
of good things, and it's never too late to go after one. You're never too old." 
</P>
<P>
White, a 1976-79 Trojan tailback who finished his Ram career in 1988, heads a 
newly organized USC venture that the university has spun off its Degree 
Achievement Program (DAP), which has been in place for five years under 
Athletic Director Mike McGee. 
</P>
<P>
The DAP is a scholarship-continuation project. 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose you used up your football or tennis eligibility -- your scholarship -- 
last year," McGee said. "But you still lack a few units for graduation. The 
Degree Achievement Program is for you. It takes care of things like tuition and 
books while you finish school this semester. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we've had 89 men and women in the program, at a cost to the athletic 
department of a half million dollars. That's $500,000 for a project that has 
nothing to do with winning and losing, but we're glad to do it." 
</P>
<P>
White's program, on the other hand -- the Former Students Degree Achievement 
Program (FSDAP) -- kicks in when a player returns after, typically, a career in 
pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
"The (FSDAP) program isn't free," McGee said. "In return for tuition and so on, 
you'll have to contribute some of your time to the athletic department or in 
community relations." 
</P>
<P>
DAP students work a flat 10 hours a week for the department. 
</P>
<P>
"We comply with the NCAA on all this," McGee said. "We do as much as they 
allow." 
</P>
<P>
For reluctant dropouts, that can often be just enough. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PROBLEM 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, only one thing is really wrong with college football, some 
critics contend. The problem, they say, is that the universities don't educate 
their athletes. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of such critics, the game is flawed in the following respects: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The schools and the NCAA waste too much time monitoring presumed financial 
indiscretions. Though some student-alumni actions may break NCAA rules, they 
don't break U.S. laws. It is legal in this country to get paid for playing 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In big-time college sports, the real sin is the widespread failure of the 
nation's major universities to cut their athletes in on the benefits of higher 
education. At the least, every varsity athlete, in return for helping an 
academic institution win football or basketball games, should be taught to 
read, write, speak properly, add little sums and discuss the main events in the 
history of the world he was born into. 
</P>
<P>
To make sense out of that world, a minimum essential for most young people is a 
college education. 
</P>
<P>
But as recently as five or six years ago, there still wasn't much evidence that 
many colleges cared about the academic well-being of any athlete after he had 
completed his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
The change began in the mid-'80s, when some college sports administrators began 
cooperating actively with former student-athletes in degree-attainment. 
</P>
<P>
The athletic department's helpful projects at USC are one indication of the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Another indicator is at UCLA, where a similar program -- called Final Score -- 
is administered by Fred Stroock, the school's associate athletic director in 
charge of academic and student services. 
</P>
<P>
"Our special interest is the former student-athlete whose eligibility is used 
up but who still wants his degree," Stroock said. "Regardless of whether it 
takes one (academic) quarter or several years, our office assists them until 
they graduate, keeping each one in touch with counselors, tutors, and others. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 120 former athletes in Final Score since 1985, 75 have received their 
degrees -- including (offensive linemen) Duval Love and Robert Cox of the Rams, 
(Indianapolis quarterback) Tom Ramsey and (Seattle kicker) Norm Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bruins have yet to recruit a celebrity as widely known as USC's 
Charles White to corral former athletes, they aggressively seek candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"Each year we go after the new (crop) of former student-athletes," Stroock 
said. "When necessary, we call their families to let them know we're here to 
help. A player who doesn't make it in pro ball is often too discouraged and 
embarrassed to come back on his own. We try to smooth the way." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's oldest assistance program for aspiring athletes is probably at 
Notre Dame, which since shortly after World War II has long been pushing 
graduation as the preferred option for all. 
</P>
<P>
Still in charge is the Irish fencing coach, Mike De Cicco, who doubles as 
academic counselor, and who this year has brought back, among others, Charger 
linebacker Cedric Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the NCAA has been slower to act. It was only in 1988 that it began 
funding grants to former student-athletes around the country who had exhausted 
their schools' aid opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"These are full-ride (scholarships) worth from $3,000 to $12,000, depending on 
institutional costs," Ronda Dakan said from the NCAA's disbursement office. 
</P>
<P>
"They go out strictly on merit -- grade point average, honors, and so forth. 
Some schools haven't had any grants. Arizona State has had 12, Kansas 10, UCLA 
one." 
</P>
<P>
The former Bruin football player who got his, Fritz Jordan, is a sixth-year 
engineering student. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston five years ago, under the auspices of Northeastern University, Dr. 
Robert Lapchick organized a consortium of 55 schools -- among them Nebraska, 
Florida, St. John's and Sacramento State -- to promote degree achievement by 
former student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Said coordinator Charles Farrell: "The consortium is an information-sharing 
think tank that has already brought 471 athletes back to finish school." 
</P>
<P>
In a land with 600 football-playing colleges and a multitude of dropouts, it 
can be said that Northeastern, Notre Dame, UCLA, USC, and others in the NCAA 
have only made a start. But it's a nice start. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE JOB 
</P>
<P>
The walls of Charles White's new office at USC have been decorated with 
reminders of his storied career, mostly pictures and other mementoes, the 
largest of which is an enormous reproduction of the Trojans' 1979 football 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
That was White's big year on campus. He won the Heisman Trophy that year. An 
oil painting of White the athlete, commissioned by the Heisman committee, hangs 
on the wall behind his desk. 
</P>
<P>
The game he remembers most vividly, however, was his first as a freshman, the 
day that Missouri routed the Trojans in the 1976 opener, 46-25. It was the only 
time they lost that season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Ricky Bell's last year," he said. "When practice began that fall, I was 
the fifth-string tailback. After I had a long gain of 79 yards (against 
Missouri) the first time they put me in, I knew I could play." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years after his 2,000-yard Heisman season, White seems wholly 
comfortable at his new desk -- looking as if he belongs there, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the second-chance business now," he said between phone calls from 
prospects. "Most people don't get a second chance to come back for their 
diploma, but that's what we're offering here." 
</P>
<P>
Since spending the 1980s in the NFL -- five years at Cleveland before joining 
the Rams -- he is his own best customer on campus, taking the first of the four 
classes he needs to graduate. He is a speech major. 
</P>
<P>
At 32, White can look back on ample servings of both great problems and great 
distinction as a young adult. To begin with, he had come from a broken home in 
the San Fernando Valley, where, living with grandparents, he was eventually to 
count two sisters and six stepbrothers. 
</P>
<P>
After throwing away his first chance at a college degree, White, as a pro 
athlete, was caught up in the drug labyrinth that has ravaged so many in his 
generation. The NFL once suspended him for 30 days for substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
He has rebounded to wear a third hat at USC as drug counselor as well as 
student and assistant to the athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
He commutes from Mission Viejo, where he lives with his wife, Judi, and five 
children ranging in age from 9 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my goals is to put all five through SC," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, most of his energy is going into his new job. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I enjoy most is interacting with the people who make the university 
what it is," he said. "The first time around, I missed all that."

TEXAS: BOILERMAKER COACH CRITICIZES OFFICIATING AFTER TRAVIS MAYS MAKES TWO 
FREE THROWS WITH SEVEN SECONDS LEFT TO GIVE LONGHORNS A 73-72 VICTORY.

<P>
While Texas celebrated its 73-72 upset victory over No. 10-ranked Purdue Sunday 
in the second round of the NCAA Midwest Regional, Boilermaker Coach Gene Keady 
launched into an obscenity-laced tirade against the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got good kids who work hard and they're in there crying their eyes out 
because we've got guys (officials) who don't understand the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Mays knew exactly what he had to do when he stepped to the free-throw 
line with seven seconds left. He made two free throws and then Guillermo Myers 
blocked a shot as time ran out, sending Texas into the regional semifinals in 
Dallas Friday against No. 25 Xavier (Ohio), which upset No. 8 Georgetown, 
74-71. 
</P>
<P>
Mays' shots hit nothing but net despite hoots and howls from a mostly Purdue 
crowd of 40,000 at the Hoosier Dome. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to the free-throw line I wasn't nervous at all. I thought I was 
going to knock them down," said Mays, who committed a turnover on the previous 
Texas possession. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous when the ball went out of bounds (on the previous possession). I 
was just hoping we could regain possession." 
</P>
<P>
Mays grabbed his own missed shot and was fouled as he went back up. Tony Jones, 
who missed a three-point attempt with 25 seconds left, then drove the lane only 
to encounter Myers, who knocked away Jones' jumper. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been coming from behind all year long and somebody always has to come up 
big," Texas coach Tom Penders said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second loss in eight days for Purdue, which lost a chance to tie 
Michigan State for the Big Ten championship, 72-70, the previous Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Keady, who didn't say he was upset about anything in particular, was just angry 
about the officiating in general. 
</P>
<P>
"People cheat and you can't get calls," he said. "They charge and you don't get 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
"The same thing happened in the Michigan State game. It gets old. We run a 
program, graduate all your kids, you don't cheat. You do things right and the 
referees are all the same." 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns (23-8), who trailed, 56-47, with 12 minutes left, capitalized on 
missed free throws and Purdue turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers (22-8) missed the front end of three consecutive one-and-one 
opportunities while the Longhorns kept getting closer. 
</P>
<P>
A jump shot by Joey Wright, who led the Longhorns with 20 points, gave Texas 
its first lead of the second half, 69-68. The lead changed hands three times 
before Mays, who finished with 16 points, made the free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Scheffler led Purdue with 18 points. But he was ineffective against the 
aggressive, physical Texas defense, making only six of 16 shots. But he 
finished his career with a shooting percentage of .686, breaking the NCAA 
record of .678 set by Steve Johnson of Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Scheffler made two free throws to put Purdue ahead, 72-71, with 1:47 remaining. 
The Boilermakers then seemed to have the victory when Mays dropped the ball and 
it went out of bounds with 1:22 left. Purdue was unable to get the ball inside 
before Jones put up his shot from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Jones couldn't get his last shot past Myers. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw an opening, tried to penetrate and took it," Jones said, adding that he 
didn't feel any contact from Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Blanks scored 19 points for Texas before fouling out with 1:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers, playing patiently on offense as opposed to the Longhorns' 
run-and-gun style, built a 35-33 lead at halftime following two free throws by 
Jones with 51 seconds remaining.

TIDE, REALLY ROLLING NOW, ROUTS ARIZONA; 
</P>
<P>
ALABAMA: SANDERSON THINKS HIS TEAM IS OVERLOOKED, BUT 77-55 VICTORY OVER THE 
SECOND-SEEDED WILDCATS IS WORTHY OF RESPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Alabama Coach Wimp Sanderson contends that the Crimson Tide doesn't get the 
respect it deserves because it plays in Tuscaloosa instead of New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we were in New York or the Eastern part of the country we'd be 
ranked, because the Eastern media ranks the teams," Sanderson said. "But 
personally, I don't really care if we're overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
After defeating No. 14 Arizona, 77-55, in an NCAA West Regional second-round 
game Sunday at the Long Beach Arena, to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the fifth 
time since 1982, maybe the Crimson Tide will earn some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Lute Olson was impressed with Alabama after the Crimson Tide 
handed the second-seeded Wildcats (25-7) their second-largest defeat of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they played as well as anyone we played all year long," Olson said. 
"They whipped us in every possible way we could get whipped." 
</P>
<P>
Alabama (26-8) faces Loyola Marymount (25-5) in a West Region semifinal game 
Friday at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
How does Alabama match up against Loyola Marymount? 
</P>
<P>
"The way that Loyola is playing right now, I don't think that anybody, 
including the Lakers, could match up with them," Olson said. "It's almost eerie 
the way they're shooting it. It's obvious they're on a mission. I don't know if 
I've ever seen a college team play better than they did today (in a 34-point 
victory over Michigan.)" 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson is also impressed with Loyola Marymount's high scoring offense. 
</P>
<P>
"They need a couple of extra digits on the scoreboard," Sanderson said. "I saw 
the guy that punches the numbers up there and he had his finger in ice water. 
They're playing awfully well now." 
</P>
<P>
Alabama is playing well now, too. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing in a second-place tie with Louisiana State in the Southeastern 
Conference, Alabama won the conference tournament and has won its two NCAA 
games by 17 and 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we had a good team all year," Sanderson said. "The more we played 
together it seemed the better we got." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Alabama has flourished has been the Crimson Tide's 
aggressive defense. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing just 61.6 points per game this season, Alabama's defense limited 
Arizona to its lowest point total of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama did a nice job of shutting down Arizona's perimeter offense, 
particularly in the second half, when the Wildcats shot just 29.2%. Arizona's 
three outside shooters, guards Matt Othick and Matt Muehlebach and forward Jud 
Buechler, missed 21 of 30 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little frustrated," Muehlebach said. "They really changed up 
defenses well. Whatever they threw at us seemed to work." 
</P>
<P>
After scoring a career-high 28 points in Arizona's 79-67 win over South 
Florida, Arizona forward Brian Williams was ineffective against Alabama, 
failing to score. Hampered by sore knees, Williams played just 14 minutes. Sean 
Rooks started the second half in place of Williams and scored 11 points before 
fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
"After Brian played 28 minutes on Friday, we knew we were going to have a hard 
time with him making much of a contribution," Olson said. "It was obvious to us 
early that he wasn't going to be much of a contributor and we knew that Sean 
Rooks was going to have to play a lot of minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Alabama also did a good job of shutting down Arizona's inside game, 
out-rebounding the Wildcats 40-27. 
</P>
<P>
How did Alabama out-rebound Arizona's taller front line? 
</P>
<P>
"They're so big and strong we knew that we had to beat them with our 
quickness," said Alabama forward Keith Askins. "It was like David and Goliath. 
They had us outsized but we came up with some loose balls." 
</P>
<P>
After scoring 27 points in Alabama's 71-54 win over Colorado State, forward 
Robert Horry was ineffective after getting into foul trouble. Horry, who failed 
to score in the first half, had just eight points, but center David Benoit took 
up the slack, scoring 20 points and grabbing 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 46-42, with 15 minutes left, Alabama put the game away with a 25-12 
run. Horry had eight points in the spurt, hitting two three-point baskets, and 
Benoit added six. Alabama shot 54.2% in the second half against Arizona's 
defense, which had held its opponents to 38.9% this season.

<P>
DODGERS: PLAYERS ENTHUSIASTIC, BUT SHORTENED SPRING TRAINING WILL BE CRUCIAL 
FOR MANY OF THE RECOVERING ONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jim Gott answered the phone at his Salt Lake City home late Sunday with two 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is this? What happened?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger relief pitcher was informed that baseball's 32-day lockout had 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeaaaaaaaaaa," he screamed. 
</P>
<P>
As the baseball season returned to the Dodgers Sunday, so did enthusiasm. Gott 
began throwing pre-sorted piles of clothes into a suitcase, Jeff Hamilton felt 
his hands for protective callouses, and Manager Tom Lasorda sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally," Lasorda said early Monday morning at the Dodgers' Vero Beach, Fla., 
training site. "Finally." 
</P>
<P>
The end was not so much a surprise as a relief. The Dodger trainers are already 
in Vero Beach. The Dodger equipment, which usually travels by truck, is already 
packed and will be shipped on the first available freight plane today. Rooms 
for players who canceled reservations at condominiums are being cleared at 
Dodgertown. Even the club's six players from the Dominican Republic have visas 
in hand, and can catch the first available flight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all ready for them," Lasorda said. "Now we just have to see what we 
get." 
</P>
<P>
That is the hard part. Because of last season's injuries and this winter's 
roster meddling and the basic laws of aging, the Dodgers will be one of the 
teams most affected by a lockout. The reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kirk Gibson has already said he will not be ready for opening day. Gibson, 
recovering from August knee surgery, has not touched a bat or ball since then. 
It will be at least a month before he is full strength. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels, another Dodger outfielder recovering from knee surgery, has said 
he is ready to play, but has not yet tested himself against competition. 
</P>
<P>
"For all clubs, it will be questionable now if injured guys are ready," pitcher 
Mike Morgan said. "That will be a fact of life." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Many Dodgers have not worked out during the lockout. Jay Howell said he has 
rarely pitched. Tim Belcher said he has pitched, "once or twice." Utility man 
Mickey Hatcher said he has only run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been really hard to keep in shape, and I know there won't be a lot of 
guys ready to go," Hamilton said. "I've been to a batting cage a couple of 
times, so I'm just glad I've got some callouses." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gott, who said he has pitched every day and feels recovered from last 
summer's elbow surgery: "This will give us a chance to see who the real 
professionals are. On a veteran team, a lot of guys use spring training to get 
ready. I just hope that this year, those guys realized they couldn't take it 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- With several off-season acquisitions, the Dodgers were going to use the 
spring to help with possible position changes, with right fielder Hubie Brooks 
possibly moving to third, and with new center fielder Juan Samuel getting extra 
work at that position, which he has only played for one year. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do any of that stuff now," Lasorda said. "We aren't going to play a 
lot of games before the start of the season, it will be hard to get a look at 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said that essentially, spring training will simply become a matter of 
finding the players who are in the best shape, and playing them. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is, we don't know what condition guys are in, that's what we'll 
spend a lot of our time doing," Lasorda said. "Maybe some guys who aren't in 
shape can get in shape real fast, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said that this could be a good opportunity for some top minor leaguers, 
most of whom have been in camp since Feb. 15. Among those players are pitcher 
Mike Munoz and outfielders Billy Bean and Mike Huff. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a case of, if we got a guy who isn't ready, and some young guy who 
is ready, we might go with the young guy," Lasorda said. "It just all depends 
on what it looks like when the guys get here."

ANGELS WILL MAKE EARLY PITCH WITH SIX STARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the best trades are the ones that aren't made. 
</P>
<P>
In a normal spring, the Angels might have dealt one or more of their six 
starting pitchers to acquire offensive help. But in this lockout-shortened 
spring, keeping all six looms as the best decision General Manager Mike Port 
never made. 
</P>
<P>
With half the time to prepare for the season, pitchers are likely to have less 
stamina than after a six-week camp and capable of pitching fewer innings when 
the season starts. The more proven starters a team has, the better its chances 
might be in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
"With the depth we have, everybody was thinking the Angels were going to be 
making some trades in spring training, but now they can wait until mid-April," 
first baseman Wally Joyner said. "Everybody we sent out on the mound is going 
to have big-league experience. We still have six great starters. Maybe that was 
smart. Somebody knew what they were doing holding on to all the pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven agreed that the Angels could benefit more from the shortened 
spring training than teams that aren't as dependent on their pitching. 
Blyleven, Mark Langston, Kirk McCaskill, Chuck Finley, Mike Witt and Jim Abbott 
make up the starting staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels will begin training in Mesa, Ariz., where they usually opens before 
going to Palm Springs. How long they will stay in Mesa remains to be 
determined, but it is likely they will move to Palm Springs in time to pick up 
the last three games of their exhibition schedule March 26-28 against San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It might help us out even more because we have an abundance of pitching," said 
Blyleven, who joked that he has had his bags packed for a month. "It's not like 
one team is going to be ahead. As far as innings pitched, everybody is going to 
be in the same boat." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish said the Angel pitchers might not even be far behind where they 
would be at this stage of an uninterrupted spring training. All of the pitchers 
have been throwing regularly, most frequently at UC Irvine but occasionally at 
colleges and high schools around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"These are mostly experienced guys, and at this point of their careers they 
know exactly how to open themselves up as far as preparing and I'm sure they've 
been doing just that," he said. "These are guys who know their schedules and 
how to work." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish and Joyner expected the hitters to have a tougher time getting started 
than the pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't imagine too many guys have been facing game-type pitching. I haven't 
hit off pitching yet, just the hitting machine," Parrish said. "There'll be a 
little bit of an adjustment there." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner: "The transition from batting practice pitching to live pitching might 
take two weeks, 2 1/2 weeks. It depends on the player. As far as myself, I've 
got the blisters on my hands already."

WHAT HAPPENS NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the major league owners and players having come to an agreement in New 
York Sunday, ending the 32-day spring training camp lockout, here are some 
questions and answers concerning the situation: 
</P>
<P>
Question. When will the regular season start? 
</P>
<P>
Answer. April 9, one week after it had been scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How many games will be played? 
</P>
<P>
A. At least 158, with an effort being made to complete the entire 162-game 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When will training camps open? 
</P>
<P>
A. Immediately, with players expected to report by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What will be the effect on exhibition games? 
</P>
<P>
A. Of 410 exhibition games, 362 have been canceled. Teams will be allowed to 
begin exhibition play March 26. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I have tickets to opening day, April 2 in Dodger Stadium. What happens to 
them? 
</P>
<P>
A. The Dodgers said Sunday night that they will talk with the Padres today to 
try to get them to come to Los Angeles for an April 9 opener and a one-game 
series. Both clubs were scheduled to be off on that day. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What will the effect of a shortened spring training be on the Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
A. Perhaps a greater effect than that felt by most clubs because key players 
Kirk Gibson and Kal Daniels are returning from off-season surgery and Juan 
Samuel and Hubie Brooks are new to the club after off-season transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
A. It may have less effect on them than on many clubs because of the club's 
veteran pitching staff. It is generally considered that pitchers take longer to 
prepare for a season than position players. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How many negotiating sessions were involved in hammering out the agreement? 
</P>
<P>
A. 34. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why so many? Why did it take so long? 
</P>
<P>
A. Several issues were agreed to in principle early, but throughout the 
negotiations it was apparent that the salary arbitration option for players 
with more than two years and less than three would be a sticking point. It was, 
until the very end. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How was it resolved? 
</P>
<P>
A. The owners agreed to allow 17% of those players to apply for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How many is that? 
</P>
<P>
A. Of the 83 in this year's class, 14 would have been allowed to submit for 
arbitration. Next year's class has 91 at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will the Freeway Series between the Dodgers and Angels be played? 
</P>
<P>
A. The Dodgers said Sunday night that it would be played, probably a week late. 
That would put games on April 6, 7 and 8.

NEWSWIRE: RADJA SAYS CLUB IS READY TO LET HIM BE A CELTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yugoslavian basketball star Dino Radja said Sunday he was determined to play 
for the Boston Celtics next season, and that his home club had agreed in 
principle to let him go. 
</P>
<P>
Radja signed with the Celtics last year for $425,000, but the contract was 
blocked by a U.S. federal judge, who said Radja had a valid professional 
commitment with his Yugoslav team Jugoplastika. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Celtics still want me, I'm ready to play for them next season," Radja 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-10 center said that even though his Yugoslav contract runs for two 
more years, "Jugoplastika has in principle agreed to let me go this year." 
</P>
<P>
Radja denied recent reports in the Yugoslav and Western press that he has 
offered to continue playing for one more year for Jugoplastika, the European 
champion, for $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Such reports are simply not true," he said. "In Europe I can get five times 
the amount given to me by the Celtics, but still I'm determined to join the NBA 
team. Playing in the NBA represents a challenge for me."

A GLOBAL OUTLOOK; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: JAPANESE DESIGNERS MAKE A SPLASH IN PARIS. BUT IT'S THE FRENCH WHO 
IMPRESS WITH AN EASTERN EUROPE INFLUENCE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese presence at the fall ready-to-wear collections has never been more 
apparent. But the clothes making the strongest impression are by French 
designers who relate fashion to current events in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-born Rei Kawakubo for Comme des Garcons was among the first big names 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
The disheveled look ruled her runway on Thursday. Clothes appeared to be put on 
wrong, so that extra necklines dangled from the bodice or the waistline of day 
wear cut from a fabric that resembled cotton mattress padding, and evening wear 
in pastel velvet. 
</P>
<P>
The look conveyed an ineptitude that was humorous but unsettling. After all, 
these clothes are meant for grown women. 
</P>
<P>
At Yohji Yamamoto Show, circus music set the tone for tuxedo jackets with tails 
in front, not in back, and art-to-wear evening dresses that looked like a 
child's collage made from paper grocery bags. 
</P>
<P>
After a number of such eccentricities came down the runway, a classic 
Western-tailored pants suit sparked a burst of applause from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
That said a lot about what hits and what misses the mark this season. Anything 
too contrived, too consciously arty, looks wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Issey Miyake's work always straddles the line between fashion and art. This 
time art won. Most of the clothes were too sculptural, not wearable enough. 
What did work were his long evening dresses with lantern-shaped pleats and 
soft, folded origami-like collars. What absolutely did not work were his 
stretchy unitards with cone-shaped padding. 
</P>
<P>
Hanae Mori, who has maintained her business in Tokyo and Paris for three 
decades, hosted an exhibit of 35 years of her work, held Thursday evening, in 
the Pavillon des Arts, near the Contemporary Art Museum, Centre Pompidou. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, she was a definite minority among Paris-based Japanese 
designers. But not anymore. This season close to a dozen Japanese will show 
their collections here before they take them to Tokyo to exhibit in May. Most 
designers in the group have boutiques in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
Thierry Mugler was the first to show a collection with an Eastern European 
flavor. It was all about Berlin before the war. Body-gripping stretch pants; 
strapless, lattice-back tops; torso-molded jackets, most of them in black, 
recalled Berlin cabarets and Berthol Brecht, as well as Barbarella, the Jane 
Fonda movie character. 
</P>
<P>
In the showroom after the event, the clothes looked comparatively tame -- but 
still not exactly standard fare. The curves turned out to be built into the 
Space-Age fabrics with enough body of their own to stand up like furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Paul Gaultier continued the Eastern Europe idea on Friday night with one 
of the most creative collections of this season. His refugee ensembles recalled 
history book accounts of Poles, Russians and Czechs fleeing home and Adolf 
Hitler, taking only what they could carry. 
</P>
<P>
Included were marabou-feather boas wrapped around man-tailored, tweed pants 
suits. There were ski sweaters and ski boots layered under sequined evening 
sheaths, and Fair Isle unitards topped by satin boleros. 
</P>
<P>
These clothes told far more than just fashion stories about fabric mixes or 
day-into-evening dressing. They spoke about a moment in history that Gaultier 
obviously finds moving. 
</P>
<P>
His intelligence, tempered by his obvious sensitivity to the subject, gave this 
show the feeling of a tribute. 
</P>
<P>
And for all their eccentric, eclectic appearance on the runway, the clothes 
were classics. The gabardine and wool tweed pants suits in particular were 
exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Lagerfeld was among those whose inspiration came from closer to home. He 
showed feminine, modern-minded clothes but made them look like the latest from 
the streets of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Jackets in warm shades of red, blue and violet, as well as black, seemed 
inspired by 18th-Century men's wear. Many were almost knee-length, nipped at 
the waist, flared at the hem, with touches of black velvet at the collar or 
cuff. He showed them over very short pleated skirts or leggings for a lively 
but still elegant effect. 
</P>
<P>
As if to disguise their virtues, the clothes were accessorized with some 
too-hip, too-aggressive details: Cuffed, over-the-knee boots the models stomped 
around in; extra-bold scale silver brooches and bangles, and black or blond 
jaw-length wigs, teased into a snarl. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Montana dedicated his show Saturday to Sgt. Pepper of Beatle's fame and 
pop artist Andy Warhol -- two icons from the 1960s. Defining this collection 
were tent dresses with bell-shaped sleeves; stretch pants; full, short coats, 
and acid color combinations, such as violet with lime. Almost every outfit 
began with stretch pants. Most often they were topped by knee-length coats. 
Patent leather collars looked especially new, and at the same time, very '60s. 
It was a good collection.

D.C.'S DEFLATED EGO;

<P>
HISTORIC GLOBAL EVENTS HAVE MADE SKY-HIGH HEADLINES, BUT LEFT WASHINGTON 
FEELING LIKE A LEAD BALLOON.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring is at hand. The cherry blossoms are blooming. The Berlin Wall has 
fallen. The Sandinistas are on the way out. Inflation is down; campaign coffers 
are up. So why is Washington moping? 
</P>
<P>
The city that likes to think of itself as The Nerve Center of the Free World is 
in a funk, just as newer, more vigorous centers of power are emerging around 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Washington is sort of like a middle-age man staring in a mirror, 
noticing his flabby middle and anguishing over the demise of his appeal as 
younger, brasher guys push past him. 
</P>
<P>
"In Eastern Europe, they have revolutions," says Jeff Garin, a Democratic 
political pollster. "Here in Washington, all we have is Chinese water torture 
and self-analysis." 
</P>
<P>
It has been 50 years since World War II and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
pushed Washington onto the center of the world stage. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the limelight is elsewhere. One day a Communist bloc nation chucks 
the reigns of terror, the next, the Germanys talk reunification; one day South 
Africa is shaking off apartheid, the next, the Japanese are gobbling more New 
York real estate. 
</P>
<P>
And all the while, the city where once bloomed the thought to send a man to the 
moon is bogged down by budget deadlock and the politics of the nasty. 
</P>
<P>
"My boss has gotten so eager for a little attention," confessed one Republican 
aide, demanding anonymity, "he's even gotten into issues back in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"At press lunches," he adds, "all we talk about is how we wish someone would 
anchor all those anchormen to their desks instead of to the airlines." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Washington has been flooded by reminders of its heady past. Dozens of 
bright-eyed delegations from Eastern Europe, itching to learn the ways of Uncle 
Sam, have hurtled through the hallways that always have been thought to ooze 
power. Polish journalists are hovering around editors at "Roll Call," the 
newspaper of record in Congress; student interns from Hungary are trailing 
after senators, and recently an entourage from Czechoslovakia arrived on the 
doorstep of the Democratic National Party. 
</P>
<P>
Mike McCurry, the DNC communications director, spent time with the Czechs. As 
they left for home weighed down with copies of party bylaws and notes on 
conventional political warfare, McCurry got this sinking feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had to cross my fingers and think, 'Gee, I hope it turns out better for 
you guys than it has for us,' " he says. "Clearly, they believe in us more than 
we do in ourselves these days." 
</P>
<P>
Even foreign journalists and diplomats who once saw a Washington posting as the 
climax of a career are feeling the change. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty happy until last spring when I saw what was going on in China on 
TV," says Radio France reporter Jean Hess. "I realized I was wasting my time 
here. It's not the same importance; people you talk to are less excited. 
Nothing big happens." 
</P>
<P>
After nine years here, Hess is heading home. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes it takes an outsider to put things in perspective. One 
high-ranking diplomat from an exciting European city observes that it might be 
a little early for people "inside the beltway" -- a catch-phrase for a capital 
engrossed by inside politics and encircled by a busy interstate -- to be 
singing the blues. 
</P>
<P>
"America is still a pretty important place," the diplomat said. "It's still an 
important part of the world balancing act. It's just not the only place." 
</P>
<P>
As always, the tone of official Washington is set, in large part, by the mood 
of the White House. And under President George Bush, whose most frequent 
metaphor for his job is that of a "steward" -- one who receives a legacy and 
passes it on intact to others -- the White House has become a decidely low-key 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades ago, President John F. Kennedy set a pugnacious, aggressive tone 
for the capital of a nation that would "pay any price, bear any burden" to see 
its ideas prevail. By contrast, Bush told the nation in his Inaugural Address: 
"Our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring down." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, speaking in San Francisco, Bush said his task was to "manage (a) 
period of transition. I would rather be called cautious than I would be called 
reckless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President's defenders say his approach is exactly what the times and the 
voters call for. But there is no doubting the effect that a government of 
stewardship has had on the mood of its capital. 
</P>
<P>
"The condition of being a Washington insider in the early 1990s is the 
condition of being stuck," McCurry says. "We can't devise programs to answer 
real needs because there's no money. There's no new money because we refuse to 
raise taxes or cut the deficit. We can't get the political debate off dead 
center because no one has their 'message' together. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't seem to do anything," he gasps, laughing at himself. "So we just sit 
here watching the world spin and feeling irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
In the rest of America, however, Washington's irrelevance doesn't come as much 
of a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, pollsters Jeff Garin and Peter Hart have asked this Washington 
question on polls they have done for congressional and state candidates: "Which 
would you prefer: an experienced person with seniority and a proven record in 
Washington or someone new with fresh approaches to change things in 
Washington?" 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty consistently voters across the country are saying they want someone 
who's going to change things, and it doesn't always mean they're going to kick 
out the incumbent," Garin says. "In this election year, you'll see a lot more 
incumbents spending a lot more time talking about how they're going to bring. 
That's what we're advising our candidates to do." 
</P>
<P>
But, not surprisingly, given Washington's history of self-obsession, the 
capital's boredom with itself and image problems throughout America has become 
one of the city's hottest topics. 
</P>
<P>
The first musings appeared six months ago in the hometown newspaper, about the 
time China was convulsing and Bush was busy naming individual Americans to be 
"Points of Light." 
</P>
<P>
It was Washington Post columnist Dale Russakoff who first pointed out that many 
Washington big shots were feeling a little like Ingrid Bergman in the closing 
scene of "Casablanca," where Humphrey Bogart tells her that their problems 
don't amount to a hill of beans. Russakoff wrote: "In a city where 
self-importance is epidemic, where pomposity permeates even the business 
slogans . . . that constitutes quite an affront." 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until David Broder -- the Post's political heavy-hitter -- 
weighed in that the debate really got going. Broder, a local institution, 
argued that Washington was being eclipsed on all fronts -- internationally, 
economically and politically. He quoted past and present greats: the likes of 
ABC's David Brinkley, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and former White 
House aide Clark Clifford. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford likened Washington's post-war ascent to that of Rome and Greece, and 
concluded that the decline was inevitable because the United States had 
"frittered" away its advantages and reduced "this economic Gibraltar to the 
largest debtor nation in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Soon the end of Washington was being heralded all over the place -- Time, 
Newsweek, even Governing magazine, which pondered "hollow government." 
</P>
<P>
Many reporters think Washington has become mighty dull, says Jonathan Rauch, a 
former National Journal reporter who is about to move to Japan to write more. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it has been dull for some time," Rauch says. Former President Ronald 
"Reagan had something to do with making it less dull, simply by force of 
personality. But the place is really dark now, and you hear a lot of reporters 
commiserating that they feel like they're covering Luxembourg." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
These kind of observations, insists one congressional insider, could only come 
from a lot of bored journalists -- at the end of winter. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all out there jaw-boning," said one top congressional aide. Said 
another aide, during a break in a budget session as he raced through the 
underground tunnel between the House and the Senate: "It's a straw man 
argument. We're up here doing crucial business and they (columnists, 
journalists and others) are down there criticizing. Business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry Hyde (R.-Illinois) says confidently, "I think Washington is still 
the center of the world. The future is going to be busy, challenging, 
demanding, productive. All that decline-of-power stuff that they're writing 
about is malarkey." 
</P>
<P>
In his view, Washington is simply in a lull. "Don't worry," he says with 
lip-smacking anticipation, "the focus will be intensified on the Hill any day 
now, probably as soon as we get into the budget and try to hammer out our role 
as the leader of the free world." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Thomas (R.-Calif.) also dismisses the moaning and groaning about 
whither Washington. The current outbreaks of democracy are an affirmation of 
America's greatness, he says, and credits its largess over the years for 
bringing it about. 
</P>
<P>
But even Thomas, a staunch, no-nonsense conservative, worries whether 
Washington is up to the tumultuous times. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about people being as bold they should be," he says. "I worry about 
them thinking as great (of) thoughts as they are capable of." 
</P>
<P>
There's a time to think great thoughts and a time to go to parties, and in 
Washington they are easily commingled. 
</P>
<P>
But to some, the Administration's habit of staying home by the VCR is 
compounding the problems. This is a city where, for years, as much business was 
accomplished after hours as was during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Carolyn Peachey, a party planner and longtime Washington doyen of 
fun, says theBush Administration has put a bit of a damper on the 
pigs-in-the-blanket set. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't go out," she says. "They're more calm, more settled, they've all 
been around for a while so they don't feel compelled to go to parties. 
</P>
<P>
"So you don't go with the same anticipation to an event the way you used to in 
the . . . Reagan days. You don't go with the anticipation that this is going to 
be a hot night because there's this hot issue going on, and we'll hear all 
about it and then read about it the next morning in the paper. Forget it." 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot more private entertaining going on in Washington, smaller 
dinners for eight friends as opposed to "trying to put an evening together with 
the powers that be," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Peachey -- who observes that in Washington, "there is simply no cult of 
personality around any more" -- speaks admiringly about Czechoslovakian 
playwright-President Vaclav Havel and South African activist leader Nelson 
Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
And to make matters worse, in a city that has always smugly prided itself on 
being impervious to swings in the national economy, real estate prices in 
Washington are dropping. 
</P>
<P>
"You haven't heard from the Chicken Littles in this town," says Clarence 
Williams, a personal trainer at one of the toniest gyms around, "until you've 
heard them complain about their townhouses losing value. Remember this may be 
Washington, but it's also America."

Change of Style: Lee Atwater, the Republican National Committee chairman with a 
reputation for down-and-dirty politics, recently was discovered to have a 
benign brain tumor, and he told the State newspaper of Columbia, S.C. it's 
given him a new outlook on life. "Forget money and power . . . I had no idea 
how wonderful people are. I wish I had known this before."

Take Note: A federal official may have written his own "arrest" warrant. Donald 
Enos, a former high official with the Agency for International Development, 
which funneled non-lethal aid to the Contras, has pleaded guilty in Washington 
to two felony counts of soliciting bribes, the agency said Friday. And the key 
evidence was a stenographer's notebook that Enos carried with him everywhere. 
U.S. investigators videotaped a meeting in Honduras in which Enos received 
about $2,000 in cash and a promise of $21,000 more from New York contractor 
George Kraus in exchange for Kraus getting a contract with AID. Kraus 
cooperated with the investigation. Court documents quoted Enos: "Even if 
somebody got (the notebook), nobody could figure out what this is . . . . It 
doesn't say where the money is coming from, where the money is going." 
Investigators thought differently. They arranged for Enos to come to Washington 
for a meeting. He brought the notebook and was arrested.

Homeless Help: Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has joined the advisory 
board of Trevor's Campaign for the Homeless. The campaign is the brainchild of 
11-year-old Trevor Ferrell, who in 1983 began handing out blankets to people 
sleeping on the streets of Philadelphia. The program has expanded with 
volunteers delivering food and clothing to the homeless in 16 cities 
nationwide.

Election, U.S.-Style?: Lee Ann Elliott, who heads the Federal Election 
Commission and who visited the Soviet Union last year, said the new politics 
had brought some nasty tactics to last May's Congress of People's Deputies 
election. "From what we were told, two days before the election Moscow was just 
papered with campaign literature, most of it saying things against candidates," 
Elliott said. "From the reaction of the candidates, most of it was very rough."

THE ART AND SCIENCE OF CINEMATOGRAPHY; 
</P>
<P>
ACADEMY AWARDS: THE WORK OF THE FIVE NOMINATED DIRECTORS OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS 
ASSESSED BY THEIR COLLEAGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Every year has its outstanding movie images, those visual moments that linger 
in the mind long after the credits have rolled. Somehow, Michelle Pfeiffer 
slithering on a grand piano in a clinging burgundy dress singing "Makin' 
Whoopie" to piano player Jeff Bridges in "The Fabulous Baker Boys" comes to 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene stood out for reasons other than the way Pfeiffer takes to 
burgundy. It was the way the camera, under the supervision of Oscar-nominated 
cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, captured her image, with a balance of shadow 
and light and a painterly use of colors that made the scene as playfully sultry 
as the song's lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
As veteran cinematographer William A. Fraker ("Heaven Can Wait") explains it, 
the film's cameraman "put the background lights on dimmers so that when the 
camera turns 360 degrees around the piano, he took the background out. Now, all 
of a sudden, (Pfeiffer) is the most important thing on the screen. You have 
only an illusion of people in the background." 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of artistry academy cinematographers say they look for when 
nominating works for Oscars -- images created through movement, lighting, 
composition and color that help a director tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
In this article, the first in a series spotlighting the nominees in the 
"technical" categories of the Academy Awards, we asked several directors of 
photography -- "DPs," as they're known in the trade -- to explain why the work 
of the five nominated cinematographers merited special praise. 
</P>
<P>
The nominees for best cinematographer in 1989 are Ballhaus, Freddie Francis 
("Glory"), Robert Richardson ("Born on the Fourth of July"), Mikael Salomon 
("The Abyss") and Haskell Wexler ("Blaze"). 
</P>
<P>
Opinions about the images of these films vary among their peers, depending on 
what their own interests are. Fraker, for instance, acknowledges that he is a 
"lighting man," meaning that he is more impressed by work done under artificial 
lighting than in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
John Alonzo ("Norma Rae") thinks lighting is over-emphasized and says there is 
a prejudice among motion-picture academy members against daylight 
cinematography. "That's why 'The Black Stallion' was overlooked several years 
ago," he says. "Well, God may have lit the horse for you, but you'd better know 
how to shoot him." 
</P>
<P>
The "prettiness" of images is what often brings moviegoers' attention to the 
camerawork. It also has that effect on fellow cinematographers, too, which 
explains the dominance of cinematographers of epic-scope movies in that Oscar 
category. Says Jan De Bont, who shot the current "The Hunt for Red October": 
"The hard part (of cinematography) is to light a scene in a dramatic way that 
supports the story. And that doesn't necessarily mean beautiful images." 
</P>
<P>
Vilmos Zsigmond ("The Deer Hunter") admits that "many times, a cinematographer 
makes things too pretty. You have to fight yourself not to." 
</P>
<P>
Cinematographers have different feelings about the style of camera use. Some 
say that with really good camerawork, you get so involved in the story, you 
aren't aware of the camera. Others say you should be aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
"In Fellini's '8 1/2' or Welles' 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' you are always 
aware of the camera," says De Bont. "To make the (camerawork) invisible, to me 
makes a movie bland." 
</P>
<P>
Zsigmond says the current slate of Oscar-nominated cinematographers reinforces 
his feeling that "the level of cinematography is higher than ever. There's more 
natural lighting. We have better cameras, lenses and film stock. 
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, the taste of audiences is improving. They are demanding more 
realism. The demand is there and so are the tools to do it. So there's no 
excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Here's how some of their colleagues assess the work of this year's Oscar 
nominees: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MIKAEL SALOMON 
</P>
<P>
"The Abyss" 
</P>
<P>
The images achieved here involved a logistic nightmare. Salomon had to marry 
his underwater photography with a myriad of visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Underwater you lose contrast," Zsigmond points out. "So the ways Mikael 
Salomon found to make everything interesting is remarkable. I'm sure academy 
voters thought it was fantastic that (filming underwater) can be done with such 
a natural approach. In the audience, you feel you're there. Good cinematography 
brings the audience into the action." 
</P>
<P>
Fraker says Salomon's use of "exterior backlighting, putting things in 
silhouette, gave a creative visual mood to objects under water. Since you don't 
define that object, your imagination takes over. That involves an audience. It 
makes them work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HASKELL WEXLER 
</P>
<P>
"Blaze" 
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth nominations for Wexler, a past winner for both "Who's Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf?" and "Bound for Glory." Yet, to the untutored eye, this 
nomination is the most puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
The naturalistically lighted historical drama can boast of neither spectacular 
scenery nor visual razzle-dazzle. Yet Wexler's work, which has already captured 
the American Society of Cinematographers' award for best feature photography, 
has fellow DPs dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad Hall ("Tequila Sunrise") notes that, "while the camera did not call 
attention to itself, there are sweet and gentle nuances. You go from room to 
room and each has a different color. The movement of the camera is exquisite 
and the compositions flawless." 
</P>
<P>
Fraker too cites the film's "changing visual look. That's what separates the 
men from the boys -- where you have 35 to 40 different sequences and moods in a 
picture, yet there's a consistency in the dramatic visual level. One scene is 
in bright sunlight and another a smoky nightclub, but the tonal levels are the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
Brianne Murphy marvels at the emotional content of the lighting. "The lighting 
tells you where you are and how the characters feel." 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo says that all cinematographers had to have been knocked out by the 
film's final shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It began as a waist shot of a figure, then pulls back to show the entire city. 
To do that you have to suspend a radio-controlled camera from the belly of a 
helicopter. Haskell designed the shot so he could change the (camera) aperture, 
iris and speed. As it pulled back to see the entire town, he had perfectly 
exposed frames. It's quite a piece of work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROBERT RICHARDSON 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the 4th of July" 
</P>
<P>
To work with the same director consistently, which occurred in the old studio 
days but is rare today, is a great advantage, and all the cinematographers 
interviewed for this story say this is Richardson and Stone's finest 
collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
"The camera told the (film's) story with its movements more than any other film 
this year," Zsigmond says. "You felt involved with the story. You were there." 
</P>
<P>
Says Hall: "I don't think I've seen a scene as nicely designed as the one where 
Ron Kovic is looking confused as (his unit) pulls out of that village. The 
village has been destroyed, there's noise everywhere, and wherever the camera 
looks it sees nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet its movements are so precise, you imagine what you're looking at. It makes 
panic understood visually. Then a very close presence appears, backlit so it's 
in silhouette. This makes it terribly understandable how Kovic made the mistake 
of shooting his own man." 
</P>
<P>
"Richardson is the most daring of all those nominated," says De Bont. "The film 
moves like crazy. The longest shot lasts only five or six seconds. You're 
taking part of the whole situation with the camera. You get inside the movie." 
</P>
<P>
De Bont also points to Richardson's stylistic elasticity, which in corporated 
the romanticism of Kovic's early childhood with shocking images in a 
rat-infested VA hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL BALLHAUS 
</P>
<P>
"Fabulous Baker Boys" 
</P>
<P>
Ballhaus came out of the German New Wave to become a top American-based 
cameraman, shooting such pictures as "The Color of Money," "Working Girl" and 
"Broadcast News." In this film, his lighting and compositions caught the eyes 
of academy voters. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy says she was impressed with the way Ballhaus handled the light, the 
balance between the foreground and background. "You got the feeling of what was 
back there without it being lit." 
</P>
<P>
"Ballhaus is very good at creating moods with shadows and light," says 
Zsigmond. "As with Dutch paintings, the exciting part (of a scene) is what is 
not lit. The cinematographer tries to create a mood to bring audiences into 
that atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Fraker appreciates Ballhaus' lighting of his female star. "I'm a romanticist. 
If you take a movie star and put her on the screen, her face is 24 feet high. I 
don't want to see flaws. It's a matter of where you position your light." 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo, who recently filmed an ensemble cast of six actresses in "Steel 
Magnolias," could appreciate Ballhaus' handling of a film with multiple cast 
members, "how Ballhaus will use the camera to accentuate one individual in the 
frame, or two or three of them. Cinematography sometimes requires a delicate 
choreography." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FREDDIE FRANCIS 
</P>
<P>
"Glory" 
</P>
<P>
Many cinematographers admit their branch of the academy tends to nominate 
exterior pictures with a big scope over more intimate films such as "Enemies, a 
Love Story" or "Dead Poets Society." "Glory," the story of a black regiment in 
the Civil War, is such a picture. 
</P>
<P>
Those who like this film feel Francis' composition within the camera frame and 
the effectiveness of his lighting were the key factors in the British 
cinematographer's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Fraker calls Francis "a magnificent black-and-white man," recalling his early 
films, "Room at the Top" and "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning." 
</P>
<P>
"The images in 'Glory' remind me of a black-and-white film than any of the 
other (nominated films). He addressed himself to overcast skies and smoke and 
heavy backlighting and didn't use a lot of fill light for the battle scenes. He 
didn't have to show a bullet enter a body to create the effects of war. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what cinematography is all about -- creating an illusion."

PUSHING THE ENVELOPE WITH VISUAL EFFECTS; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: NEW TECHNOLOGY ENABLES SPECIALISTS TO PUT ALMOST ANY IMAGE THAT A WRITER 
CAN DESCRIBE ON THE SCREEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRK HONEYCUTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until recently screenwriters were careful to check with special effects experts 
before describing imaginative images on paper. They didn't want to write a 
scene that couldn't be shot. 
</P>
<P>
Not today. As Richard Edlund, the Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor of 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark," puts it: "Now virtually anything can be done 
(visually). If you can describe it, you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Jonathan Erland of the special effects house Apogee Inc. says newer doesn't 
always mean better. "There are two versions of 'King Kong.' The remake enjoyed 
a lot of advanced technology unavailable to the original film makers. Yet I 
don't know anybody who prefers the remake. The original had a much clearer 
vision of what it was about." 
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has no visual effects branch, 
leaving the selection of Oscar nominees up to a committee made up of art 
directors, cinematographers and others recognized as experts in special 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
Here are this year's visual effects nominees and what some experts in the field 
think of them. 
</P>
<P>
John Bruno, Dennis Muren, Hoyt Yeatman and Dennis Skotak. 
</P>
<P>
"The Abyss." 
</P>
<P>
"Two radically different environments -- water and air -- were cut seamlessly 
together," notes academy member Bill Taylor, co-owner of Illusion Arts, the 
company that did effect work on "Glory" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." "Smoke 
was used to simulate underwater in certain sequences, such as when (the divers) 
came upon the crashed sub. These had to be combined with miniature underwater 
scenes and full-scale underwater scenes." 
</P>
<P>
To create the underwater illusions, veteran special effects expert Linwood G. 
Dunn says the visual effects people combined new techniques with the refinement 
of known technology. Relying on information supplied by the film's producers, 
Dunn notes that the film contained 290 effects shots covering 21 minutes of 
film. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with full scale all the way down to one-eighth-inch models required 
all the tricks in (the visual effects) bag," Dunn says. 
</P>
<P>
One effect that excited academy members was the image of the underwater aliens. 
"The alien creatures and their minisubs were completely transparent," Taylor 
says. "All the working parts were visible. That's never been attempted before." 
</P>
<P>
The computer-generated water tendril that snakes through the ship's interior 
and touches actress Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's face is another example of 
the film's "trailblazing." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Conway and Kent Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen." 
</P>
<P>
"The film charts no new ground in terms of technology," says Taylor. "But it 
uses every existing technology -- mechanical effects, photographic effects, 
models, miniatures -- and exploits them beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
Erland, who worked on the original "Star Wars," says "Munchausen" reminded him 
of "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a tendency since the first 'Star Wars' to get a little 
pretentious about effects. The later ('Star Wars') films were more proficient, 
but the first one had a sense of panache and the sheer joy of storytelling. We 
got that back with 'Munchausen.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dunn says the film included more than 275 optical effects, involving the 
photographing and combining of multiple images. "And all were vitally important 
to the story, which is a major factor in our voting." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Ralston, Michael Lantieri, John Bell and Steve Gawley. 
</P>
<P>
"Back to the Future Part II." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor says the visual effects producers of this film took classic techniques 
and, in Taylor's words, "pushed them further than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
The split-screen technique, for instance, allows an actor to play multiple 
roles. In one shot in this film, however, Michael J. Fox played four roles 
while the camera moved. 
</P>
<P>
"Often when you do an effect, the camera locks up and nothing moves until after 
the effect," says Edlund. "An audience detects that kind of rigidity." 
</P>
<P>
Here, split-screen and movement were achieved simultaneously through a Vista 
Glide motion picture dolly that can repeat moves over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
"Motion control cameras have been used before, but never as extensively," 
Edlund says. "They did nervy things too, like when Michael J. Fox 2 grabs a cap 
off Michael J. Fox 1's head." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a case where technology facilitates a performance," adds Erland. "To 
most people in the effects business, the ability to enhance the storytelling is 
most appealing." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Back to the Future' required the construction of 30 models intricately 
detailed down to each nut and bolt," says Dunn. "The flying cars in the aerial 
freeway ran from 3 inches to 2 feet. One shot required compositing about 100 
effect elements." 
</P>
<P>
Creating the hoverboard sequences, in which Fox skates through the air, 
entailed a massive mechanical effects job, involving huge cranes with complex 
wire rigs built to fly actors safely around. 
</P>
<P>
Another classic technique pushed to the limits involved a night shot of the 
flying car. It's a seamless cut from a miniature to a full-sized car. 
</P>
<P>
"The car is flying high in the air in the distance," recalls Taylor. "As the 
camera pans, the car flies behind a lamp post and the real actor comes out in 
one continuous shot. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first part (of the shot), they're using a half-foot-long model car. The 
second half is a full-sized car with actors. When the car passes behind the 
lamp post, they switch. The difficulty of making it match so perfectly is just 
breathtaking to professionals."

CLEVER COUPLING OF ALBEE, BECKETT AT THE MARK TAPER

<P>
At first glance it may seem like a curious pairing: Edward Albee's "The 
Sandbox" and Samuel Beckett's "Happy Days." But wait a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Don't both plays deal with survival? The snappy old lady in "The Sandbox" may 
be simply the butt of an impatient progenitor's bad joke, and "Happy Days' " 
Winnie may be struggling against much more cataclysmic odds, but in the end 
they're both after the same thing: warding off death. Death is death. What's 
the difference if it comes as a result of global catastrophe or sly family 
imperatives? 
</P>
<P>
The difference is in how we, the audience, perceive the battle. At the Mark 
Taper Forum where "Sandbox" and "Happy Days" constitute Round 2 of the "50/60 
Vision" festival of "plays and playwrights that changed the theater" (there are 
6 rounds, totaling 13 plays), it strikes this theatergoer as a cleverly ironic 
coupling. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandbox" is an inspired curtain-raiser for the longer (though not long) "Happy 
Days." Albee's 15-minute wonder waltzes across the fourth wall on a whim and 
makes confetti of sanctimonious attitudinizing. It is Albee at his best: 
winking as he plays God and teases us with the summary dispatching of a tough 
old lady. 
</P>
<P>
Grandma (Mary Carver, re-creating a role -- are you ready for this? -- that she 
played in the West Coast premiere 29 years ago) is gingerly "put away" by her 
piously solicitous daughter, known to us only as Mommy (Angela Paton, quaint as 
a middle-aged baby with a whim of steel), and her deadpan husband Daddy (Bill 
Moor, milquetoast extraordinaire). 
</P>
<P>
The human repository where they dump Grandma is a sandbox, watched over by an 
athletic Angel of Death (John Robert Lafleur), while a fifth character, a 
musician, performs at the unceremonious event. 
</P>
<P>
Paton, a natural comic, can't resist milking a few of her laughs (or is this 
director Michael Arabian's idea?), but otherwise the production sizzles with 
preposterousness, made particularly amusing by Carver's sniffing irreverence. 
</P>
<P>
This perfectly sets the stage for the sand heap that has poor Winnie by the 
waist (later the throat) in Beckett's "Happy Days." 
</P>
<P>
The landscape is apocalyptic this time. Nothing there. Especially no life. And 
Winnie (Charlotte Rae) is already waist-deep in encroaching sand. When the 
relentless bell wakes her at the start of day, she makes the best of it. 
"Another heavenly day," she says, with feeling. Later: "Begin, Winnie . . . 
Begin your day, Winnie," is more uncertain as she checks out the landmarks: her 
black handbag, her parasol. And we're off on one of Beckett's most majestic, 
most enticing, most mysterious and anguishing plays. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie is not quite alone. There is Willie (Moor). Willie, husband or lover, 
more dead than alive, but there, behind Winnie's sand heap and still breathing. 
At least. Someone to talk to. Willie doesn't always talk back, but he's good 
for a grunt now and then and, on especially happy days, good for a word or even 
a complete sentence. Once even a song. Oh, happy, happy day. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie is clinging to sanity by going through life's daily rituals, what's left 
of them, under the broiling sun. Squeeze out a speck of toothpaste. Brush the 
teeth. Read the "label" on the toothbrush. 
</P>
<P>
It's something to do. 
</P>
<P>
Check out the contents of the handbag. Bring out the revolver -- that ultimate 
reassurance. All must be ordered, parceled out, spooned carefully hour by hour, 
each thing in its time, on schedule, on cue, so no gap is left in which to die 
of sheer terror. Or silence. Above all, one must fill the dead air with sound; 
articulate words; gratitude, often; recite the enduring mercies like a rosary; 
like a diamond necklace; the little miracles that fill and force the time. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, when Winnie is cheerful and breezy, we laugh. 
</P>
<P>
When Charlotte Rae as Winnie is cheerful and breezy, it is impossible not to 
laugh. Is this woman for real? Is this meant to be funny? Oh, yes. Gradually we 
listen and learn. Gradually we begin to really hear the play. Winnie, even when 
performed by Rae -- especially when performed by Rae? -- is the defiance of the 
species. Grace under pressure. Quiet resistance. Winnie against the dying 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Because of her association with TV sitcom, casting Rae in the role was risky, 
but it was a brilliant stroke. Yes, there were isolated pockets of people at 
Friday's performance who still thought that anything that came out of Rae's 
mouth had to be just plain hilarious, but fewer and fewer as the play 
progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Her cracking voice, her almost foolish matronly squeal occasionally slicing the 
air, the very ordinariness of this Winnie -- nobody grand at all here, nobody 
messianic -- endow the performance a creeping and ultimately gripping stature. 
</P>
<P>
Director Carey Perloff wisely lets Rae be Rae, and by the time this play is 
over, you know this Winnie is as frail and conquerable as the rest of us. But 
much, much braver. The hush that fell on the house in the second half, when all 
that is left of Winnie is her head, above the sand -- her frightened eyes, her 
endless concatenation of words, her unfathomable dignity -- was no accident. 
</P>
<P>
Rae had earned it. Bravely.

Video Deal: The image of the home-video business as a dog-eat-dog jungle full 
of combative companies is changing. 
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented instance of cooperation between two of the biggest companies 
-- Paramount and Warner -- was announced recently. They're jointly financing a 
30-second TV ad promoting sales of Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade" and Warner's "Lethal Weapon 2" -- both available at $24.98. The 
commercial, now in 17 markets, features clips from both action films. Both 
movies have been in the top three on Billboard's rental chart for the last few 
weeks. CLAUDIA PUIG

BRUSSELS BRINGS MOZART'S 'LA FINTA GIARDINIERA' TO BROOKLYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York likes its opera grand, loud and comfortable. This is Met city. 
</P>
<P>
This is the place where the voices are usually more important than the music, 
and the music is more important than the drama. 
</P>
<P>
This is the place where adventure, no matter how trendy, tends to be dangerous. 
This is the place where innovation is instantly suspect, where introspection 
seems superfluous and ensemble values tend to be unreasonable abstractions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it wasn't too surprising that Mozart's "La Finta 
Giardiniera," imported by the Brooklyn Academy of Music from the Theatre Royal 
de la Monnaie of Brussels, received a lukewarm reception from the New York 
press. 
</P>
<P>
"La Finta Giardiniera"? Mozart finished this sprawling dramma giocoso when he 
was only 19. It is generally regarded as a minor masterpiece, at best. 
</P>
<P>
One reads about it, but hardly ever gets to see it. If performed uncut, as it 
was here, it lasts 4 1/2 hours -- about as long as "Siegfried." 
</P>
<P>
Musically, it is predicated on a series of Baroque formulas and stereotypes. Or 
so, at first, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
The quasi-comic libretto, questionably attributed to Giuseppe Petrosellini, 
resembles a formidable jumble. It abounds in convoluted confusions involving 
heroic intrigues, quaint masquerades, amorous imbroglios and multiple mad 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to accuse Mozart of painting by the numbers here. Too easy. 
</P>
<P>
Just when one thinks the path is obvious, he takes off in an unexpected 
direction. The melodic flights can be commonplace one moment, deliriously 
original the next. Sudden harmonic shifts suggest wry detours in the dramatic 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the pervasive comic conventions one discerns the threat of bitterness 
and the hint of tragedy. There are ample previews here of such coming 
attractions as "Cosi fan Tutte" and "Figaro," even "Don Giovanni." 
</P>
<P>
The Brussels production, first mounted at the tiny Theatre Royal du Parc in 
1986, has been honed to a fine polish after more than 50 performances in such 
locales as Vienna, Salzburg, Berlin, Antwerp and Amsterdam. It is 
sophisticated, thoughtful and uncompromising. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes soothingly bright and often disturbingly bleak, it stands as a prime 
example of modern musical theater as practiced in the better European houses. 
It demands intense concentration as well as generous stamina. 
</P>
<P>
The local critics found it mildly pretty. They complained, with some 
justification, about its length. Some lamented the absence of stellar singers. 
A few were mystified by the contemporary anachronisms in the staging. One 
writer was offended by sight of a soprano who didn't happen to shave under her 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, a visitor approached the second of three performances at the 
Majestic Theater with some trepidation. The house, an expensively scraped-down 
movie palace, is a chic and uncomfortable Post-Modern ruin. Peter Brook 
appropriated it for the local incarnation of his "Mahabharata." Luckily, the 
size -- 900 seats -- is right for intimate Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
And, luckily, the Brussels performance was right. It may have stressed the 
neuroses of contemporary Angst to a degree unsupported by the generally sunny 
score. It may have allowed stylistic liberties that must disturb historic 
purists. Nevertheless, it revealed a consistent, provocative, illuminating 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvain Cambreling conducted with a splendid combination of musical grace and 
theatrical verve. A 26-piece orchestra from Brussels executed his orders with 
high spirits if low finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Karl-Ernst Herrmann designed the stylized forest park that served as a magical, 
amazingly flexible set. Together with his wife, Ursel Herrmann, he also devised 
the brashly tragicomic, eventually poetic staging scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The multinational cast functioned as an integrated team, though hardly as a 
team of nonentities. Joanna Kozlowska as the countess disguised as the titular 
gardener, introduced a soprano of limpid purity, striking agility and arching 
pathos. One would like to hear her as Fiordiligi. Elzbieta Szmytka, as the 
lovesick maid, sang with piercing brilliance and proved once and for all that 
the perfect soubrette need never rely on pert soubrette mannerisms. One would 
like to hear her as Blondchen. 
</P>
<P>
Ugo Benelli, the veteran bel-canto tenor, brought a crisp sense of self-mockery 
to the deranged platitudes of the Podesta. Marek Torzewski managed to vacillate 
sympathetically between character and caricature as the amorous count, despite 
some meek vocalism. Malvina Major complemented him as the flamboyant, initially 
prissy Arminda. 
</P>
<P>
Lani Poulson wore her mustache and trousers with elan as the knightly Ramiro, 
and sang with impetuosity worthy of a fine Cherubino. Rusel Smythe played the 
wily servant with baritonal irony that clearly pointed in the direction of 
Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
Lurking about the odd midsummer shadows and silently commenting on the eternal 
foolishness of these mortals was a witty little figure invented by the 
Herrmanns and deliciously mimed by Mireille Mosse. She functioned as a 
wondrous, other-worldly fusion of usher, stage manager, living prop and bemused 
spirit of Eros. Somehow, she also managed to remain unobtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
The audience shrank appreciably as the evening wore on. The hardy souls who 
survived for the final curtain, however, mustered a thunderous ovation. In 
Brooklyn, attention had been paid.

'EMERALD CITY': ADVENTURES IN THE FILM TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poor Colin -- which is to say, poor David Williamson, who created Colin in his 
own self-image, as the central figure in his "Emerald City," at South Coast 
Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Though he's "the screenwriter with the best track record" in Australia, he has 
been beset by intellectual snobs in Melbourne. They just don't understand the 
importance of his self-assigned role: to write about the denizens of the middle 
class and to "keep charting their perturbations." So he flees to Sydney, where 
he finds himself beset by philistines. 
</P>
<P>
We learn all this within the first few minutes of "Emerald City," and right 
away we know most of what there is to know about the play, as well as about 
Colin. It's essentially an explanation of Williamson's own career moves, a 
self-justifying and self-pitying chart of his own professional "perturbations." 
It becomes self-deprecating only on the most superficial level, the "look at 
me, I can even make fun of myself" level. 
</P>
<P>
Though it's written in what's supposed to be a realistic style, the dialogue 
often sounds flagrantly false, as if "Emerald City" were composed as an 
autobiographical essay and then rushed into dramatic form without much thought 
given to the idea of natural-sounding conversation (or is "perturbations" 
tossed out in Australian chitchat more than it is here?). 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue is occasionally funny, too; Williamson makes sure that Colin, 
representing himself, gets most of the best quips. Sometimes, though, it's all 
thunderingly banal. "You're going to have to decide," Colin's wife tells him, 
"between art and money." There isn't a trace of subtlety in this play. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson probably thought he was addressing subjects bigger than Colin: the 
unending conflicts between commerce and art, between Sydney and Melbourne, 
between egos in marriages of two professionals. 
</P>
<P>
But these subjects haven't been skillfully dramatized. The play is about 
Williamson's opinions on these topics, more than it's about the topics 
themselves. We don't meet any of the Melbourne-based "Chardonnay socialists" 
who criticize Colin, or any of Colin's children who apparently have been 
affected by the move to Sydney -- we simply hear Colin and his wife discussing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, there is a lot of talk about preserving Australian culture in this 
play, but there are few examples of it. Characters' tongues wag over the 
prospect of Australian film projects being transplanted to America, in greedy 
attempts to appeal to the international market. Yet aside from a few slang 
words, this play could just as easily be about a writer who moved from Berkeley 
to Bel-Air -- which is surely one of the reasons why South Coast is staging it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's the only reason imaginable -- the theme of "Emerald City" fits 
into the general outline of South Coast's season. This is the year South Coast 
stopped ignoring the movie industry and started bashing it. The recent premiere 
of "Search and Destroy" made this seem like a good idea, but "Emerald City" 
serves only to point out how much better a play "Search and Destroy" is. Still 
to come is another commentary on movie making, "Speed-the-Plow." 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, it's fun to watch protean Jarion Monroe, who played the smarmiest 
and most self-confident of all the hustlers in "Search and Destroy," here 
playing ever-wavering Colin. He does his best to find corners of this man's 
personality that aren't spelled out in the ultra-explicit text. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cast, mostly SCR pros, is just as good: Anni Long as Colin's 
wife, a publisher who faces her own conflict between art and money; Richard 
Doyle as Mike, the grubby partner who temporarily hitches his leaky wagon to 
Colin's career; Leslie Hope as Mike's live-in lover (this is a little hard to 
believe) and Colin's potential mistress (this isn't); Sally Kemp and Dan Kern 
as a producer and financier, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Set designer Michael Devine provided a backdrop that suggests the harbor view 
that most of the characters covet, while remaining abstract enough to serve 
other purposes too. Peter Maradudin lit it with cool colors, costumer Karen J. 
Weller added splashes of color on Hope (who looks as terrific as the text 
requires) and Nathan Birnbaum added a gently throbbing sound track during scene 
changes. In general, the design is more artful than the text. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't difficult. In the Emerald City in "The Wizard of Oz," we don't 
find out what a charlatan the title character is until late in the story; here, 
Williamson tells us how crass Sydney is in the very first conversation. There 
isn't much incentive to follow him down this particular yellow brick road. 
Where is L. Frank Baum when we need him?

PRO-SECESSION CANDIDATES LEAD IN LATVIA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Estonians and Latvians cast ballots in their Soviet republics' first 
multi-party parliamentary elections Sunday, with nationalists predicting both 
victory and a slower approach to independence than that seized by the 
neighboring Baltic breakaway state of Lithuania a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial returns from Latvia, gathered by the grass-roots People's Front, 
showed pro-secession candidates apparently on their way to an impressive 
victory. Early results showed they had taken at least 109 seats to at least 29 
for anti-independence campaigners, according to Anda Anspoka, spokeswoman for 
the Front. 
</P>
<P>
But Anspoka said it was too early to declare victory since the group needs a 
two-thirds majority in the 201-seat legislature, or 134 seats, to implement its 
independence plan. 
</P>
<P>
No early returns from Estonia were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
In Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, about 35,000 people led by Communists still 
loyal to Moscow rallied outside a sports complex against the week-old 
independence declaration, with some protesters carrying signs reading "We Don't 
Want to Live in a Bourgeois Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
V. Lazutka, a party secretary, told state-run Soviet television, "We view the 
events here as a coup that liquidated the constitution." 
</P>
<P>
The bold action by Lithuania's legislature was the first crack in the 
theoretically voluntary union of 15 sovereign Soviet republics and may spark 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's gravest domestic cri sis. On Sunday, Gorbachev 
denounced the act as a "wrongful decision" but did not say what, if anything, 
the Kremlin would do to reverse it. 
</P>
<P>
"Something was decided overnight, in the heat of the moment," Gorbachev told 
reporters after voting in local and parliamentary runoff elections held in 
Moscow and much of Russia. "Nevertheless, we shall carry on the dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev denied that a three-day limit given Lithuanian leaders to answer the 
Soviet Parliament's charge that their March 11 proclamation was illegal 
constituted an ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we shall receive a reply from the authorities of present-day Lithuania 
and, depending on it, everything else will become clear too," said Gorbachev. 
Without elaborating, he added: "The character and content of a reply will 
determine our subsequent steps." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian example was on the minds of many voters in the neighboring 
Soviet republics of Estonia and Latvia as they cast ballots in elections for 
republican parliaments. All three Baltic states became independent after World 
War I but were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 under a secret 
agreement between Josef Stalin's regime and Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lithuanians have shown us how it can be done," Sarmite Elerte, chief of 
the information center of the pro-independence Latvian People's Front, said by 
telephone from her republic's capital of Riga. But she said there also had been 
a negative effect on non-Latvian residents "who fear a similar turn of events 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Since Lithuania's breakaway move, ethnic Russians in Latvia are in "an alert 
mode," Igor V. Lopatin, chairman of the Russian-led Interfront group, said from 
Riga. "People feel a threat, and activity in the elections is a natural 
response. Lithuania has served as a catalyst for the Russians in Latvia." 
</P>
<P>
Non-Latvians are a force to be reckoned with since Latvians make up only 54% of 
the republic's population of 2.7 million. To elect 201 members of Latvia's 
Parliament, voters chose from among 384 candidates, of whom 187 were endorsed 
by the People's Front, including Valdis Steins, leader of the republic's Social 
Democrats, and the chiefs of the environmentalist Greens and the Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
Janis Vagris, the republic's Communist Party chief, sat out the elections, a 
pointed contrast with past practice, when the party could expect automatic 
voter approval for the sole nominee it proposed for each seat. However, 70% of 
the candidates were members of the Communist Party, and the two top government 
leaders, President Anatoly Gorbunov and Prime Minister Edvin-Vilnis Bresis, ran 
unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Elerte said the People's Front sought to elect at least two-thirds of the 
membership of the Latvian Parliament to have the majority required to alter the 
republic's constitution and restore independence. But she predicted that 
candidates endorsed by the grass-roots group would win little more than half 
the seats Sunday, making swift action impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"A proclamation of independence, however, is not in doubt," Elerte said. "It 
will happen. We just don't know when this will be -- in the legislature we are 
electing now, or in the one after that." 
</P>
<P>
In Estonia, 30 parties and political organizations fielded 392 candidates for 
100 seats in the republic's legislature, including at least three groups 
calling themselves Social Democrats and a separate Green Party, Green Movement 
and Green Regiment. That seeming variety was deceptive, said Estonian Radio 
commentator Harri Tiido: "All Estonian parties as a matter of fact have quite 
similar platforms -- the main goal is an independent Estonia." 
</P>
<P>
Among the best known candidates were Communist Party leader Vaino Vyalyas, 
President Arnold Ruutel and People's Front leaders Marju Lauristin and Edgar 
Savisaar. Only about one-quarter of the total were Communists, and Tiido 
stressed that "even those Estonian Communists who are running support an 
independent Estonia." 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Estonians, however, make up only about two-thirds of their homeland's 
population of 1.6 million people, and Russians and other non-Estonians running 
in enclaves in the republic's northeast, where they are in the majority, were 
expected to win election to Parliament easily. 
</P>
<P>
Where the Estonians part ways with the Lithuanians is over tactics, preferring 
a more cautious approach. "They declared themselves independent, then asked to 
begin negotiations (with Moscow)," commented Tiido. "We Estonians want to start 
negotiations, then think about declaring independence." 
</P>
<P>
Estonia has also created an institution without parallel in Lithuania: a 
Congress representing people living in the small Baltic homeland at the time of 
the 1940 Soviet takeover and their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
That body, which met for the first time this month, is considered the legal 
heir of the Estonian state, while the Parliament is regarded as a creation of 
the occupation, Tiido said. However only Parliament's decisions are likely to 
have validity in Moscow's eyes, he admitted, so ideally, the institutions will 
join in pursuing a restoration of Estonian independence. 
</P>
<P>
Runoff elections were also held in the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and 
Byelorussia, the three republics that make up 80% of Soviet territory and are 
home to two-thirds of its 290 million people. The first round of elections 
March 4 left many local and parliamentary posts unfilled, including 948 of the 
1,068 seats in the newly created Russian Congress of People's Deputies and 352 
spots in the 450-seat Ukrainian legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the problem was the large number of candidates who split votes 
among them, including more than 20 in some districts of the Russian Federation. 
But the chief problem Sunday appeared to be voter indifference. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television's evening news program Vremya, quoting the Central Elections 
Commission, said voter turnout in the Slavic republics was between 40% and 50%. 
By Soviet law, if less than half the voters take part, then new elections must 
be held.

'NO-PAIN' STYLE MAY HURT BUSH IN LONG RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of last month's U.S.-Latin American drug summit, a reporter asked 
President Bush how he could expect South American peasants to stop producing 
cocaine unless America agreed to pay higher prices for "alternative" products, 
such as coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The President immediately acknowledged the point -- "these economies are 
hurting," he conceded -- but he insisted that his hands were tied. "I have a 
problem" in backing the Latins' pleas for higher coffee prices, he said. 
American consumers "don't necessarily want to pay" any more than they are. 
</P>
<P>
It was a casual, offhand remark, but a revealing one. Although the President 
has cited the war on drugs as the issue that is likely to prove most crucial 
for him politically, he seems reluctant to embrace solutions that involve 
sacrifice by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is not an isolated one. After 14 months in office, Bush, who has 
said he wants to become the "education President" and the "environmental 
President," is emerging instead as a "no-pain President," reluctant to ask 
voters to accept any short-term discomforts even if they are likely to result 
in long-term returns. 
</P>
<P>
William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a 
conservative-oriented think tank, calls Bush "a status quo President" who has 
shunned any call for "a sense of a higher rationale" that might help produce 
bold, long-term results. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that Bush's low-key style is a change of pace. History 
books are brimming with calls for sacrifice by Bush's predecessors: During the 
depths of the 1981-82 recession, Ronald Reagan called on Americans to "stay the 
course." In the face of the Arab oil embargo, Jimmy Carter eventually raised 
gasoline prices to force Americans to conserve fuel and end the irksome 
gasoline lines. And, in the face of rapidly accelerating inflation, Richard M. 
Nixon broke with Republican tradition and imposed wage and price controls. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Bush has not avoided all such gambles. All sides agree that the 
U.S. invasion of Panama that he ordered last December was risky by any 
standard. Had the assault been more difficult, it might have embroiled the 
United States in a messy Vietnam-style conflict that could have gone on for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even in Panama, while the President asked American soldiers to make the 
ultimate sacrifice, he asked little of the nation as a whole. And the invasion 
aside, he generally has avoided taking stands that might anger any large groups 
of voters. 
</P>
<P>
There are these examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although the nation is facing a mounting medical-care "crisis," with 
rapidly escalating costs that are threatening to crimp benefits for 
middle-class Americans, the President conspicuously has shunned the issue. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Bush adviser says the President and his aides have "made an explicit 
decision to avoid health-care issues" for fear that they might generate too 
much controversy that might later cost the White House politically. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The outbreak of peace and the emerging new democracies in Eastern Europe 
and Latin America have heightened the need for increased U.S. foreign aid, an 
item that traditionally has not been popular among American voters. Yet, 
despite warnings from some quarters that the United States will lose influence 
if it does not step up its foreign assistance, Bush has not sought any major 
increase in the foreign aid budget. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bush repeatedly has argued for reducing the federal budget deficit, but -- 
like most of his Democratic opponents -- he has been unwilling so far to 
propose any bold remedies. Indeed, critics say he has ruled out the most 
workable solution by adopting, and refusing to soften, his pledge for "no new 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
In defense, Bush's advisers argue that the President's no-pain posture is just 
what the doctor -- or at least the electorate -- ordered. After years of tumult 
and major policy changes, voters do not want bold action from the federal 
government, says Robert S. Teeter, his longtime pollster and adviser. Bush was 
elected to provide "continuity," Teeter says, not to overcome any "singular 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Teeley, another longstanding Bush adviser who once served as his press 
secretary, agrees, arguing that, in the current environment, proposing bold new 
strategies is unlikely to prove very profitable. "Anything that has to do with 
a little bit of pain to the American people, the Democratic leadership (in 
Congress) will take it and run against you -- and he's outnumbered," Teeley 
asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush advisers argue, unlike the situation during the Reagan and 
Carter years, there currently is no overshadowing "crisis" that cries out for 
bold action. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that, crisis or not, there is no dearth of major challenges 
to propel a President into action. Bush himself has identified several. He has 
said he is "haunted" by the image of children growing up in poverty in American 
cities. He has vowed to stop the "scourge" of drugs. And he has pledged to 
eliminate the federal deficit. Traditionally, it has been the President's job 
to rally the nation to confront such woes -- not the other way around -- these 
activists say. 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri sparked angry 
denunciations from the White House last week by accusing Bush of failing to 
show leadership in reacting to events in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
More muted -- and usually anonymous -- criticism has come from Republicans as 
well. "Where's our housing policy? What's our health policy?" a prominent GOP 
strategist said rhetorically last week. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Schneider and other analysts warn that the President's reluctance to 
be bolder now may undermine his leadership over the longer run. "As long as 
things are going well, he'll be popular" in appealing solely to the status quo, 
Schneider said. But, he argues, presidents traditionally have built their 
most-enduring support by convincing voters to follow them in making hard 
choices. "The issue is whether he has people who will stick with him when 
things go wrong," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, the polls show Bush is tremendously popular. Recent Los Angeles 
Times surveys have shown his popularity rising to 73%. 
</P>
<P>
But the statistics also reveal some voter doubts. When asked if Bush was 
offering a "clear blueprint" in foreign policy or just "catching up" to events 
elsewhere, 67% of those questioned said the President was just playing 
catch-up. Only 17% said they thought he had a clear plan. 
</P>
<P>
The President soon may face another test, this time over how bold he will be in 
seeking a deficit-reduction agreement with Congress. After months of inaction 
by both sides, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.) has just proposed a plan that calls for increasing taxes for 
upper-income Americans and cutting federal entitlement programs, both measures 
that involve substantial "pain." Bush has called the plan a good starting point 
for White House-congressional talks, but has not said what he might put forward 
as a counterproposal. 
</P>
<P>
The major question is whether the President will abandon his "no new taxes" 
pledge to accommodate some sort of budget compromise. Rostenkowski argues that 
what voters today are clamoring for is "somebody with a program that asks us to 
make a sacrifice and tell it like it is." But many of the President's advisers 
disagree, contending he would suffer a serious setback if it modifies his 
stance on a tax increase.

EVANS SCHOOL IS AN ISLAND OF REFUGE FOR IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With just the clothes on her back, Siu Ling Li swam to freedom, from Canton 
across the South China Sea to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Bautista twice risked muggings by Mexican bandits and capture by 
immigration officers. 
</P>
<P>
Chhuan Rong lost his brother to a Khmer Rouge bullet, dodged land mines on his 
way out of Cambodia, and spent three years in a teeming refugee camp in 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Now all three are Los Angeles residents, their perilous journeys behind them. 
But their struggles are not over. Needing skills that will enable them not just 
to survive but to succeed in America, they are among the thousands of 
immigrants drawn each year to Evans Community Adult School in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With 13,000 students from more than 80 countries, Evans is the nation's largest 
and most polyglot adult school. Known to many students before they set foot in 
the United States as the "biggest and best" adult school in Los Angeles, it 
plays an essential role in helping newcomers join the mainstream of American 
society. 
</P>
<P>
While massive immigration has brought fundamental changes and tensions to many 
Los Angeles communities, Evans is seen by students and teachers as an island of 
neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is heaven on Earth," said veteran teacher Dave Baker, whose 
beginning English class has Armenians, Chinese, Mexicans, Salvadorans and a 
woman from Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this diversity of cultures, Evans students say they all have the same 
goal. "We all want to learn English and function in this society," Bautista 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The campus pulses with activity. On most days, the school is open from 5:50 
a.m. to 9:15 p.m. Twice a week, amnesty classes run until 2:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Anchoring the northeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and Figueroa Street, Evans 
is comprised of a gleaming red and white, cube-shaped building and several 
aging bungalows. The campus is plain, functional and free of graffiti. Except 
for the occasional multilingual notice, such as the ones posted inside some 
lavatory stalls on how to use the toilet, most signs are in English. 
</P>
<P>
The school draws much of its enrollment from the large immigrant communities 
that surround it -- Chinatown, East Los Angeles, Echo Park, Westlake and the 
Olympic and Wilshire corridors. But many students, bypassing adult schools in 
their own communities, come from farther afield, such as the San Gabriel and 
San Fernando valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Some students come straight from the airport, suitcases in hand. 
</P>
<P>
But the school struggles to fulfill its mission against a background of lagging 
resources -- and with increasing numbers of students who lack even the most 
basic literacy skills. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the 27 adult schools operated by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, Evans has a lengthy waiting list for English classes -- 1,500 at last 
count in February. 
</P>
<P>
The typical beginning English class at Evans has 50 students, which educators 
say is far from ideal, even when the pupils are well-behaved and highly 
motivated grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators blame the backlog on a statewide funding cap, in 
existence for the last decade, which prevents enrollment in adult English 
classes from growing more than 2.5% a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our city has changed so dramatically in the last few years," said Assistant 
Supt. James Figueroa, who oversees adult education for the Los Angeles 
district. He said demographic shifts have created a demand for adult English 
classes as well as courses in raising children. 
</P>
<P>
Once given a seat, however, Evans students seem not to mind the crowded classes 
or long waits to get in. They like the variety of offerings and the 
six-day-a-week, nearly round-the-clock schedule. They can take courses in 
English, citizenship, U.S. history, psychology, typing, computers and other 
basic subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Students range in age from 18 to 80. And the nationalities they represent could 
rival a United Nations roll-call. 
</P>
<P>
On any given day in the school's flag-strewn cafeteria, a visitor could find a 
Thai student sharing a lunch table with a Colombian, or a Shanghai native 
poring over a book with a Soviet Armenian refugee. 
</P>
<P>
In the classroom, the mix includes a Japanese executive's wife and a former 
Salvadoran journalist, or a Vietnamese factory worker and an Argentine 
physician, all struggling over the same English adjective, expression or figure 
of speech. 
</P>
<P>
The diversity of Evans' enrollment is so dizzying that sometimes a student's 
national origin stumps even the most sophisticated diviner of cultural 
background on the school's staff, such as the time a native of Nauru -- an 
independent republic in the West Pacific near the Solomon Islands -- enrolled, 
or when six Spanish-speaking Koreans from Peru showed up in the registration 
line a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The school traces its beginnings to 1937, when an adult Americanization Office, 
a precursor of citizenship school, was established on the campus of the Cambria 
Elementary School in downtown Los Angeles. Eventually, as the need increased, 
the Cambria Adult School was formed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the adult operation moved to its own campus at Sunset and Figueroa, 
and Cambria was renamed Evans Community Adult School, after E. Manfred Evans, 
the first adult-education superintendent in the Los Angeles school district. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the school has remained true to its original purpose. 
Although officially open to all adults, Evans' main mission, said Principal 
Douglas Holmes, is to help immigrants become "competent (to live and work) in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The school's biggest draw is the English language program, which starts with 
courses in "pre-literacy" for students who lack the ability to read and write 
in their native language and proceeds through seven levels of English 
instruction. After completing the English series, many students advance to the 
high school diploma program, which is next in popularity and offers general 
academic courses. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also offers the largest college preparatory program in Los Angeles for 
foreign visa students. According to foreign student adviser Peter O. Share, the 
school has about 350 such students, who pay tuition of $1,050 a year. Classes 
are free for all other students. 
</P>
<P>
For some of the students, the struggle to attain a better life in the United 
States is almost as painful as their flight here. 
</P>
<P>
Rong, who arrived in the United States two years ago after fleeing Cambodia, 
said he despairs of ever finding a decent job because he has a physical 
handicap and lacks sufficient education for skilled work. 
</P>
<P>
But Rong, who asked that his real name not be used, spends each weekday working 
toward a high school diploma at Evans, even though he finds the curriculum 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Every lesson I have to read at least five times," said Rong, who shares a 
house near downtown with 10 relatives. "I have to study more than other people. 
I (learn) just enough to pass the class. I am worried all the time (about 
money)." 
</P>
<P>
Other students come to Evans already highly educated, wanting only to become 
fluent in English so they can continue to practice their professions in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Some students see Evans as their second chance to obtain the education that 
eluded them earlier in their lives. Bautista, 23, who is student body president 
at Evans, offered himself as an example. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I couldn't learn," Bautista said, detailing a past marked by 
frequent changes of schools because of his family's itinerant lifestyle. He and 
his family immigrated to the United States from Guadalajara, Mexico, when he 
was 9. But his father moved from one construction job to another during most of 
Bautista's youth. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Bautista dropped out of an East Los Angeles junior high school and 
went to work. He had never learned enough English to write a simple note, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But a sympathetic boss urged him to go back to school, so Bautista started 
taking English classes, soon advancing to Evans' academic program. Now he is a 
few months away from earning a high school diploma. His goal, he said, is to 
study theology in college and become a priest. 
</P>
<P>
At Evans, teachers "treat you with respect," he said. "You realize that you can 
learn and that . . . your dreams are reasonable, if you work hard enough." 
</P>
<P>
Li, 38, recalls just how limited her world was before she came to Evans. 
</P>
<P>
One of 11 children born in Nanning, China, to a well-to-do family, she was 22 
when she decided that life under communism was too stifling for her. With two 
brothers and a few friends, she escaped through Canton, swimming for hours 
across the South China Sea to reach Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
After spending five years in the British territory, she moved to the United 
States, got married, had two children and settled into a routine that she said 
consisted of staying home, taking care of her children, cleaning the house and 
tending her vegetable garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a very typical Chinese woman," Li said over lunch in the school 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband wanted her to take a job in a sewing factory, but Li wanted to go 
to school to learn English. Eventually, they were divorced, and Li enrolled at 
Evans, taking classes in English, science, psychology and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Now she proudly describes herself as being "half-American, half-Chinese." And 
she said that learning English "changed my life" because it expanded her 
horizons. She expects to earn a high school degree by fall, but said her dream 
is to study psychology in college and become a social worker helping senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Evans students, Li squeezes her classes into an already demanding 
schedule. She attends classes all day, goes home for a few hours, then works as 
a waitress from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. With 10 minutes between classes and 30 minutes 
for lunch, Evans students have little idle time. 
</P>
<P>
The fast pace, along with the faculty's efforts at cross-cultural education, 
may contribute to what teachers and students say is a generally harmonious 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Florene Rozen, who often provides cross-cultural sensitivity training 
to businesses and other private groups, said the rest of Los Angeles could 
learn a lot about human relations from Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much ethnic politics out there. That mentality is going to tear 
up L.A.," she said. "That's why I love this school. We are a perfect example of 
what can happen in America. Maybe Evans will save L.A."

AN OFFICE DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE;

<P>
TECHNOLOGISTS MAKE COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND FURNITURE BUILDERS MAKE DESKS. THE 
TWO MEET ALL TOO INFREQUENTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the renowned furniture designer Bill Stumpf teaches his industrial design 
course, he always begins with two slides. The first shows a state-of-the-art 
office complete with dimmed lights, sleek furniture modules and glowing 
computer screens. The second shows writer E. B. White sitting on a wooden bench 
at a wooden table in a shed in front of an open, bay-view window and typing on 
a manual typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
The students, Stumpf says, have little trouble deciding that the Cape Cod 
fishing shack is the far better working environment. 
</P>
<P>
The two images illustrate the dilemma faced by the computer industry, the 
furniture industry and, indeed, the entire business community as a result of 
the desktop terminal's inexorable takeover of the office. Somehow, a way must 
be found to meld the ever-expanding power of the computer into a working 
environment that is physically comfortable and mentally stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
Stumpf calls the missing element in office design "civility." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Patton, head of the product-design company Patton Design Enterprises in 
Costa Mesa, says that a work space should be "open, creative and fun." Jim 
Stewart, manager for advanced design at Apple Computer Corp., talks of the need 
for "collaborative, inter-active work tools." Nearly everyone involved in 
furniture and computer design pays lip service, at least, to the notion that 
the office of the future must do a better job of meeting "the real needs of the 
worker" than the office of today. 
</P>
<P>
There is little agreement, however, as to just how radically the office needs 
to be changed. Many in product design speak disdainfully of American business 
for not taking the problem seriously, and ominously predict that 
forward-thinking European and Japanese companies will soon fill the gap. 
Furniture and computer industry executives say, on the other hand, that they 
are moving as quickly as market realities will allow. 
</P>
<P>
That debate is likely to be fueled today, when a revolutionary office concept, 
sponsored by Apple Computer and developed by Patton Design, makes its debut at 
the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles. The prototype, dubbed Workspace 2000, 
aims to produce a comfortable, personalized atmosphere for creative work by 
integrating the most sophisticated computer equipment into office furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Patton said that Workspace 2000 will do nothing less then free the worker from 
the "ball and chain" of desk, telephone and terminal. It will allow people to 
wander freely, computerized "pads" in hand, among tables that are really 
touch-sensitive, voice-activated computer screens, office partitions that 
double as video-conference consoles and desks that contain hidden copiers and 
fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology has been making people change to meet its requirements, but it 
should be the other way around," said Patton, a muscular, mustachioed 
36-year-old. "We need to break the existing product-furniture-environment 
boundaries." Just as software advances have made computers more accessible, 
Patton said, the entire office must be overhauled to make it more "user 
friendly" and allow for truly collaborative work. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Stewart, Apple's manager for advanced design research and the moving force 
behind the company's "advanced environments" program, would not say whether 
Apple was developing special products for the Workspace 2000 concept. But he 
emphasized that all parts of the system -- from the large, flat video screens 
to the wireless communications network that links everything -- are technically 
feasible today. 
</P>
<P>
"When we presented this to the product development people (at Apple), the first 
thing they said was: 'There are a lot of things here that can't be done,' " 
Stewart recalled. "But, on closer examination, everything here is doable and 
has been shown in public." 
</P>
<P>
The Workspace 2000 model has a desk, a two-man conference table and an 
adjustable surface that resembles a drafting table when horizontal and a 
blackboard when upright -- each of which has a computer screen for a surface. 
There is also a curved partition that functions as a video screen and also can 
be clear or opaque, depending on whether the worker wants privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-held computer pads can be spoken into or used with an electronic pen. A 
pad can be inserted into a slot in one of the other devices, mounted on a chair 
arm or placed on a free-standing pedestal that contains a re-charger. Other 
components are miniature video-conference equipment and a "power pillar" for 
optical data storage. 
</P>
<P>
Though few people have seen Workspace 2000 in advance of its public debut -- 
Apple kept it under wraps for well over a year after its completion -- those 
who have are enthusiastic. "It's dynamite, beautiful, a very thorough analysis 
of the human being and how he is going to interact with his environment," said 
Ron Pierce, a designer with S. G. Hauser Associates in Calabasas and president 
of the local chapter of the Industrial Designers Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the most exciting concepts I've seen in a long time," said Lucie 
Young, an editor with Design magazine in London, which is planning a major 
feature on Workspace 2000. "The office furniture industry has recently seen 
only superficial changes. This could revolutionize the way people work." 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Bennett, a Los Angeles-based industrial designer, called Workspace 
2000 "an excellent study," and added: "This project is user-driven. Too many 
manufacturers and designers are technology-driven." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is so enthusiastic about integrating furniture and computers, 
or, indeed, about making any drastic change in the physical infrastructure of 
the office. Aside from efforts such as an experimental secretarial station 
commissioned by Xerox Corp. and built by Egg Design of Cypress, there have been 
few well-financed explorations of radical office concepts. 
</P>
<P>
George Wilmot, vice president for advanced research at office furniture maker 
Knoll International, said his company had concluded that "embedding computer 
equipment in any significant way in the furniture is not a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
He said that assessment was dictated by analysis of the way computers are 
really used, and by the simple reality that computer technology is changing so 
quickly that it would be impractical to incorporate it into furniture that 
might be in use for a decade or more. "The philosophy at Knoll is to find a 
means to house computer equipment," Wilmot said. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Rodriguez, manager for furniture systems at Steelcase Corp., noted that 
both the computer and the office furniture industries are relatively young. "We 
are both still going through our growing pains, and integration will really 
come only when we reach a certain level of stability," Rodriguez said. "We are 
involved in several projects in that area, but we have to take a step-by-step 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
A structural problem also inhibits work on computer-furniture integration: 
Computer companies are in the computer business and furniture companies are in 
the furniture business, and the two meet all too infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bressler, president of the Industrial Designers Society of America, noted 
that "the furniture industry is close to fashion, and the computer industry is 
close to engineering. These are two very polarized perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
Stumpf also pointed to "a gap in the field of interest between the computer and 
the furniture industries." He said that the Ethospace office system he designed 
for Herman Miller Inc., his primary client, was supposed to have computer 
screens in the office partitions, but collaboration with the computer company 
Unisys had not worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart of Apple said it would take "visionary business relationships" to bring 
something like Workspace 2000 to fruition. Although some such collaborations 
are in the works, representatives of Apple and other firms would not discuss 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But many in the design community believe there has simply been too little 
commitment, too little 
</P>
<P>
money and too little daring in the whole area of office design. Steve Diskin, a 
Los Angeles product designer and a partner in Mega-Erg, an office-environment 
think tank, said that the office furniture field is conservative and currently 
is characterized by "confusion and timidity." 
</P>
<P>
Diskin said he fears that the lack of innovation in office design will soon 
come back to haunt U.S. industry. "It's an exact parallel to what happened in 
Detroit (automobile industry)," he said. "They said 'the public isn't ready for 
these things' and then the Japanese came in and ran away with it because they 
were a little bolder." 
</P>
<P>
Bressler, who emphasized that he was speaking for himself and not his 
association, criticized the furniture industry as being "rather superficial 
when it comes to really dealing with technology." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while the furniture companies boast about the advances they have made 
in "cord-management" -- accommodation of electronic cables in office furniture 
systems -- many designers virtually spit the words "cord-management" as an 
example of, in Bressler's words, "designing a system for yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Computer-furniture integration, pioneered in the 1970s by the Italian designer 
Mario Bellini in studies for the office equipment maker Olivetti, is only a 
sub-set of the office-of-the-future debate. As Patton and others are quick to 
point out, the real issue is creating an office that meets the needs of 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that it's not always obvious what the office worker really 
needs, as opposed to what the boss surmises he might need. Patton says that in 
the typical modern office, "objective needs, such as the ability to compose and 
manipulate data, are well met, but subjective needs -- for comfort, security, 
ease of use, person-to-person contact, privacy, portability -- are not well 
met." 
</P>
<P>
Pinning down these "subjective" needs is not easy. Although furniture and 
computer companies brim with "human factors" specialists who analyze everything 
from the ideal height of a desk to the proper lighting of a computer screen, 
ergonomics -- defined in Webster's dictionary as "the study of the problems of 
people in adjusting to their environment" -- is still in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sorry to see that no one is investing in real ergonomic studies," said 
Charles W. Pelly, president of Designworks USA of Newbury Park, Calif. "It's a 
finger-pointing situation that goes all the way up to the architects. We can't 
get pure research money from anyone to try and look at these problems." 
</P>
<P>
In the area of basic physical comfort and safety, some progress has been made. 
The Santa Monica-based Human Factors Society has developed a standard for 
computer workstations that addresses issues such as adjustability of furniture 
and screen resolution. Biomechanics Corp. of America, a New York-based start-up 
company, has built sensing tools that can measure stresses on the human body 
with more precision than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
The best answer to the repetitive-motion and vision problems associated with 
too much work at a computer screen is to free the worker from sitting at a 
terminal all day, many designers say. And more subtle issues, such as allowing 
for the right mix of privacy and human contact -- or creating a "feel" as nice 
as the one in E. B. White's fishing shack -- are even more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Stumpf said that "many of the techno-approaches to the office are a complete 
misrepresentation of what people really want." Defining those real needs, he 
said, is often a matter of common sense. Stewart of Apple said that a main 
purpose of the advanced-design program was "need-finding," and that he tries to 
"use design as a catalyst" to looking at the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Patton said the approach he and three colleagues took in Workspace 2000 was 
based on both instinct and analysis. "A lot of it is very emotional," he said. 
"Design combines what is very rational and logical with what feels right." 
</P>
<P>
The "rational" analysis for Workspace 2000 produced a set of design goals, 
including eliminating redundancies of function, restoring the ability to move 
about freely, creating comfortable settings for conversations and group 
interaction, preserving privacy and allowing the option of customizing each 
work area. 
</P>
<P>
On a more instinctive level, each component of the Workspace 2000 system is a 
"metaphor" for a proven device such as a blackboard, a drafting table, a 
conventional school desk or a note pad. Patton said he hoped that such familiar 
forms would counteract the impersonal character of computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, even if Workspace 2000 or some other concept were deemed the ideal 
office of the future, there is always the troubling question of how much an 
employer will pay to provide a "fun" -- or even a healthful -- office 
environment. Something like Patton's project would cost tens of thousands of 
dollars per unit if it were built today, a price far beyond the reach of most 
potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate facilities managers such as Dan Derby at Hewlett-Packard realize, 
however, that an attractive working environment is more than just nice. It is 
an increasingly important tool in recruiting not only executives but also 
professionals such as engineers, lawyers and commercial artists. "We have to 
pay much more attention to the people's environment now -- there's no question 
that it's part of the recruiting process," Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
And Diskin of Mega-Erg said that new office designs could help address a key 
economic issue in the office today: the cost of floor space. If the desk is 
also a computer there is that much more room for everything else. 
</P>
<P>
Patton doesn't spend much time talking about the economic practicalities, 
though. He is more interested in the theory of the office revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these ideas are embryonic," he said, "but we're trying to create an 
inspirational workplace to elevate individual and group interactions. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, with this, you're not chained to your desk any more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Office of Tomorrow 
</P>
<P>
The office furniture envisioned by Patton Design infuses computer functionally 
into sleek modern forms. All parts of the system are linked in a wireless 
network, and plug-in program modules allow use of a variety of software 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Translator 
</P>
<P>
A curved screen that can change from clear glass to a solid-color privacy 
screen at the touch of a button. The screen is also used for teleconferencing 
and can simultaneously display data or additional images. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counselor 
</P>
<P>
A worktable for two with a surface that can display data and accept input from 
either user. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pad 
</P>
<P>
A portable battery-powered computer similar in size and shape to a note pad. 
Data can be entered by speaking to it, by handwriting on the pad's display 
surface or by scanning an image into it. The pad can be connected or "docked," 
with all other components in the system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Board 
</P>
<P>
A flat panel display that can be used vertically as an "electonic chalkboard" 
or horizontally as a work surface. Includes a telephone, fax, scanner and 
printer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Com-Chair 
</P>
<P>
A special arm designed to fit most types of workstation chairs provides another 
plug-in receptacle for the pad. The arm folds down andout of the way when not 
in use.

AMERICAN ALBUM: BLUEGRASS, BLACKTOP BATTLE IN KENTUCKY COUNTRYSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LEXINGTON, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bluegrass region of Kentucky is known for its rolling hills and horse 
farms. The charm of the surrounding countryside and the beauty of the farms, 
some of which are nestled within the city, islands of serenity in an urban 
milieu, are Lexington's main attractions. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing concern here, though, that the city's growth may be 
threatening the beauty that has fueled it. Clearly the growth, coupled with 
recent declines in the horse industry, is changing the face of much of the 
surrounding countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"Lexington is an attractive place to live and people want to live and work 
here," said Robert N. Clay, the owner of Three Chimneys Farm, home to Triple 
Crown winner Seattle Slew. "But I think one of the reasons they want to live 
and work here is the surrounding area, and we have to preserve that." 
</P>
<P>
One rapidly changing area is the fast-growing southeast part of the city. A 
gantlet of new shopping malls and housing developments precedes horse farm 
territory, which is marked by gently rolling hills, narrow roads and the 
mesmerizing regularity of wooden fences. 
</P>
<P>
The housing developments and apartment complexes have names such as Rolling 
Ridge, Saddlebrook and Old Farm. And, though some of them are landscaped in 
horse farm motifs, preservation-minded Lexingtonians lament the passing of the 
virgin fields that once stood in their stead. 
</P>
<P>
Even more troubling to some of the preservationists are plans such as those of 
prominent breeders Anita and Preston Madden to build a million-square-foot 
shopping mall on a corner of their Hamburg Place Farm east of town. It would be 
the largest shopping mall in this part of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
If all of this doesn't stop, one angry letter writer to the Lexington 
Herald-Leader complained last month, the thoroughbred capital of the world soon 
will be known as the "blacktop capital." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Houlihan, director of the Greater Lexington Chamber of Commerce, calls horse 
farming "Kentucky's signature industry . . . it creates the atmosphere that 
makes other people and businesses want to relocate here." 
</P>
<P>
There are perhaps as many as 500 farms in Kentucky with equine interests, and 
90% of them are within 16 miles of downtown Lexington, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So pervasive is the industry's influence that even Bluegrass Field, Lexington's 
airport, is landscaped in a horse farm motif, surrounded by lush grass and a 
wooden fence. 
</P>
<P>
Driving on the main route from the airport into the city, the first views are 
of bucolic hills of Bluegrass Farms, Calumet Farms and the peaceful beauty of 
the Keeneland Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
But turn right out of the airport instead of left, and follow the new road, and 
the scene is parking lots, schools, shopping centers and apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
That is because John Bunker Hunt, the Texan who was named Kentucky Breeder of 
the Year in 1988 and who is the owner of Bluegrass Farm, sold the right-of-way 
for the expansion of a major road through his property some years ago, opening 
the way for development. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's financial problems, which perhaps caused him to sell, are well known. 
Financial pressures brought on by declines in the horse industry may also be 
causing other horse farmers to sell to developers. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse industry has had happier days," acknowledged Houlihan. 
</P>
<P>
During the industry's period of spiraling growth in the early 1980s, a large 
number people who had not been involved in the industry looked out at the 
bluegrass and saw green, Clay said. A few years later, when profits started to 
shrink, these same people were eager to bail out. 
</P>
<P>
Under Fayette County's existing comprehensive growth plan, three-fourths of the 
county is designated as a rural area. The remaining quarter, the so-called 
"urban service area" that roughly comprises the city of Lexington, is where 
most of the residential and commercial development is. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Scotty Baesler wants to protect the distinctive flavor of the area by 
having the city buy development rights to undeveloped land surrounding the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Specifics of the so-called "green space plan" are being developed by a 
committee of 42 people representing preservation groups, agriculture and 
developers. The committee is expected to present its plan detailing where land 
should be acquired and recommending funding formulas later this year.

Dr. Elizabeth Morgan was reunited with her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary 
Foretich, over the weekend in Christchurch, New Zealand, after a 2 1/2-year 
separation brought about by the broken family's custody dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who had been in Auckland, New Zealand, for the past two weeks 
conferring with her New Zealand lawyer, flew to Christchurch on Saturday and 
joined her daughter and parents, Bill and Antonia Morgan, at the Diplomat 
Motel, where the Morgans have lived with Hilary for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Morgan nor her lawyer disclosed that she would be traveling to 
Christchurch, and neither would comment on whether she intended to stay there 
or return to Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's refusal to allow visits with Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, who 
Morgan accuses of sexually abusing their daughter, led to Morgan's spending 25 
months in jail for contempt of court. Morgan sent Hilary into hiding rather 
than allow visits with Foretich, who denies his ex-wife's allegations.

U.S. DECRIES SLOW PACE OF PRIEST-SLAYING INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
EL SALVADOR: FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE MASSACRE, EMBASSY OFFICIALS BEMOAN THE LACK 
OF PROGRESS. BUT SOME SAY THEY HAVE NOT PUSHED HARD ENOUGH.

SAN SALVADOR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Embassy officials are increasingly frustrated and concerned over the 
slow pace of the Salvadoran government's investigation of the deaths of six 
Jesuit priests and two other people, allegedly killed at the direction of 
high-ranking army officers. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing strong dissatisfaction, the officials said over the weekend that the 
judge in charge of the investigation and the army's Special Investigative Unit 
have listed about 180 people for interviews but have talked to no more than 
three a day. 
</P>
<P>
"At that rate it will take months," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
The priests, all faculty members of the Jesuit-run University of Central 
America, were shot to death on their campus last November at the height of a 
major offensive by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the leftist 
guerrilla organization that has conducted the decade-long civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Slain at the same time were the Jesuits' cook and her 15-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
After a string of denials by government and military officials, including 
suggestions by U.S. Ambassador William Walker that the guerrillas might have 
committed the massacre, charges were finally filed against five enlisted men 
and four officers, including Col. Guillermo A. Benavides Moreno, one of the 
army's highest-ranking members. 
</P>
<P>
Since the charges were filed, the U.S. Embassy has pushed hard for action 
against Benavides, who is accused of ordering the killings. But some State 
Department officials and members of Congress say that Walker has not been tough 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he was criticized internally by the State Department for not 
condemning more strongly reports that Benavides' situation under arrest 
amounted to a vacation, with trips to the beach, a luxury apartment instead of 
a jail cell and catered meals. 
</P>
<P>
Walker has said that "if true, the accusations were an outrage." However, 
embassy officials say there is no proof that Benavides enjoyed such treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran military officials say that Benavides, who was in charge of the 
country's military academy at the time of the killings, has been kept in a 
single room at an army installation. "His only luxury is a television set," one 
colonel said. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress, as well as political opposition leaders here, say 
that the embassy also has lagged in pushing the government to pursue a theory 
that Benavides did not act on his own and was involved in a conspiracy with 
other high-ranking officers. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy officials deny any foot dragging. But they acknowledge that they are 
greatly concerned over reports that Benavides has been receiving daily visits 
from fellow officers who reportedly tell him he has nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
Benavides is a member of the so-called tandona, the military academy class that 
dominates the armed forces' high command and includes army Chief of Staff Rene 
Emilio Ponce and Deputy Defense Minister Juan Orlando Zepeda. 
</P>
<P>
Each academy class honors a tradition of staunch loyalty to the class and often 
puts the interests of fellow class members above stated government policy. This 
is particularly true of the present tandona, which has protected class members 
even when they were accused of such crimes as kidnaping for profit. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Benavides) is being told he has nothing to worry about, that is truly 
an outrage," one U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
While not necessarily connecting the reports of Benavides' special treatment to 
the lagging pace of the investigation, the officials also expressed 
consternation that the judge in the case, Ricardo Zamora, had not even met the 
head of the Special Investigative Unit until last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we found out they had never met, we raised hell," said one official, "but 
it still took 10 days to arrange the meeting. It is frustrating as hell." 
</P>
<P>
Doubts about the government's intentions, and particularly those of the 
military, are compounded by various reports concerning the so-called "ninth 
man," Pvt. Jorge Sierra, who was one of the nine men charged in the killings 
but who was not arrested with the others because, according to the official 
announcement at the time, he had deserted. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Western diplomat and a Salvadoran citizen with close contacts to 
the government, Sierra fled the country and may have made his way to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
These sources say that Sierra heard a radio exchange between one of the 
officers at the site of the killings and a high-ranking officer at the Defense 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
According to this account, the officer on the scene said the Jesuits had been 
killed and asked what to do about the cook and her daughter, who presumably had 
witnessed the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"He was told to leave no witnesses," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
All of this has led to other reports that Col. Zepeda will be removed from the 
Defense Ministry and dismissed from the army. However, some diplomats and 
government sources say that while Zepeda, a member of the present tandona, may 
be rotated out of the ministry as part of an expected personnel shift, he will 
remain in the army in a senior position. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, except for these stories about the 'ninth man,' there is 
nothing to prove the radio conversation happened," one source said.

Narcotics agents seized about five tons of marijuana and arrested two men on 
suspicion of drug trafficking in the western city of Uruapan in Michoacan 
state, the government news agency Notimex said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted the attorney general's office as saying the first man, 
arrested with a small amount of marijuana, turned in his accomplice, who was 
captured on a ranch.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there was any one symbol for East Germans as they voted in their first free 
elections, it was the flag. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom, hope, peace -- the simple banner seemed to somehow capture the complex 
feelings that have overwhelmed these people since the Berlin Wall cracked last 
Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the flag was everywhere. It brightened the sooty windows of 
high-rises in Karl-Marx-Stadt. It waved in front of decrepit, cold-water flats 
in East Berlin. It fluttered above flower boxes in quaint old villages that dot 
the countryside. It snapped in the breeze from buildings along the Oder River, 
just a glance across the Polish border. 
</P>
<P>
Uwe Muellmann hung the biggest one he could find outside his house in 
Oranienburg, not far from the notorious World War II death camp at 
Sachsenhausen. 
</P>
<P>
Like the feelings it symbolizes, the red, black and gold flag is new to the 
East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
It is the flag of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Election Day in East Germany sparkled, and everyone, it seemed, donned their 
Sunday best to stroll about in the radiant sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Long lines often turned out not to be in front of polling stations but ice 
cream stands. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest crowds in the capital of East Berlin was in front of the 
Palast der Republik, off Alexanderplatz. 
</P>
<P>
The former Communist regime's showcase building, where Parliament meets, was 
transformed into a media metropolis, with every television and radio station in 
both Germanys broadcasting live from slick, portable studios. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign networks also set up shop, with Japanese, Spanish, English, Swedish and 
dozens of other languages creating a polyglot din. 
</P>
<P>
But the curious East Germans who flocked by the hundreds to the Palast der 
Republik weren't hoping for a glimpse of some TV personality or to ham their 
way into some crowd shot. 
</P>
<P>
They came to stare at the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
It was packed with sound trucks and satellite dishes, a high-tech al fresco 
museum for the fascinated gawkers who could come no closer than a police 
barricade ringing the lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to imagine that the whole world is watching us," said one man. 
"We're just the tiny German Democratic Republic." 
</P>
<P>
The Communists, whose iron-fisted rule promised harsh punishment to even 
mischievous vandals, bought some graffiti to celebrate Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Six-hundred placards spray-painted in 65 colors were commissioned by the 
renamed Party of Democratic Socialism to decorate the foreboding brown facade 
of what used to be Central Committee headquarters in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Fire truck ladders were used to hoist the mural, which featured a confusing 
series of abstract images and the party slogan, "We Are the New Ones." 
Spray-painted portraits of party chairman Gregor Gysi and Prime Minister Hans 
Modrow -- now newly elected Parliament deputies -- were also hung. 
</P>
<P>
And while the party advocates slower, more cautious unification with West 
Germany, some things just can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
The artwork was commissioned from three young artists based in Dortmund, West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"No East German artists could have gotten the materials or done the work as 
quickly as they wanted it -- in three days," explained one of the artists, 
Bernd Richert. 
</P>
<P>
Richert, whose professional name is "Zodiak," declined to say how much the 
Communists paid for the display, which will stay up until April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bernd Neuendorf, a 35-year-old electrician from Frankfurt-Oder, voted early in 
the day and then took a walk. 
</P>
<P>
"The election is a good thing because, in principle, it's a free vote, and in 
principle, everyone votes what they believe and has a say in the future," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, East Germans "voted" by simply folding a pre-marked ballot and 
dropping it in the box. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who asked for the privacy of a voting booth was assumed to be re-marking 
the ballot to vote against the Communists. Their names were always taken, and 
even suspicion of disloyalty often cost people jobs, promotions and privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Neuendorf found it strange and wonderful to vote for the first time in his life 
"without the comrades watching you."

Amerika voted Sunday in its first free elections in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Amerika, East Germany, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in this tiny Saxon village, population 131, filed into a bowling alley 
converted to a polling station to choose among the 24 candidates contesting the 
first free vote here since the 1932 elections that paved the way for Adolf 
Hitler's rule. 
</P>
<P>
Amerika, about 30 miles from Leipzig, got its name in 1832 when the owner of a 
spinning mill that still employs most of the inhabitants sold some of his land 
to the railway on condition that it build a station for his factory. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the construction workers came from the United States, and thus the 
village got its name. 
</P>
<P>
The village has only one tiny food store, providing just the basics. For 
anything else it is a 2 1/2-mile drive to the next community. 
</P>
<P>
The only bar closed two years ago.

LOW-PROFILE PROTESTANT: NATION'S LAST LEADER?;

EAST GERMANY: THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT GAINS SUPPORT WITH AN ANTI-STALINISM 
STANCE, NOT POLITICAL CHARISMA.

<TEXT>
<P>
Politics is a reluctant fourth career for Lothar de Maiziere, the quiet 
Christian Democrat in line to become the last leader of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, 50, is the white-whiskered churchman whose party led the 
moderate-right Alliance for Germany to stunning victory in East Germany's first 
free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Inexperienced as a politician and ineloquent as a speaker, De Maiziere never 
took center stage during the brief campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The diminutive candidate would walk unrecognized through crowds of East Germans 
who came to hear West Germany's Christian Democratic chancellor, Helmut Kohl, 
campaign for his sister party in the east. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kohl's wife drew more applause at at least one rally than the bland 
candidate himself. 
</P>
<P>
But De Maiziere is credited with purging the East German Christian Democrats of 
hard-core Stalinists after he took over the party chairmanship in November from 
Gerald Goetting, who now faces corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
By aligning the party with two newly formed parties -- the German Social Union 
and the Democratic Awakening -- de Maiziere was able to win vital support from 
Kohl's forces. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl himself made six campaign appearances in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Born near what became the West German border in a town called Nordhausen, De 
Maiziere is the son of French Huguenot immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Even as a teen-ager, De Maiziere belonged to a circle of friends whose frequent 
philosophical discussions about the church and East German society brought them 
under official suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was suspected of being a counterrevolutionary," De Maiziere told one 
interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Christian Democrats at 16. One of four satellite parties in the 
Communist-dominated National Front that ruled East Germany, the Christian 
Democrats for decades aligned themselves with the hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
But the low-key De Maiziere never actually became a counterrevolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
Raised a strict Protestant, De Maiziere was a gifted violist who played in the 
respected Radio Symphony Orchestra Berlin and other orchestras until nerve 
inflammation in his arm forced him to quit in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 35, De Maiziere embarked on a new career, studying law at 
Humboldt University in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
He combined his devotion to the church and his commitment to justice when he 
graduated, becoming a human rights lawyer and, he once said, "the only 
Christian attorney in (East) Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
He defended the church and its members against the Stalinist government and did 
legal battle for conscientious objectors against military conscription into the 
Communist National People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
A lay church official, De Maiziere served as a deputy prime minister in the 
caretaker coalition of Prime Minister Hans Modrow, the reform Communist he is 
now poised to replace. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere is married and has three daughters.

FAR-RIGHT PARTY DEALT SETBACK BY BAVARIANS; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICANS WERE WINNING ONLY ABOUT 5% OF THE VOTE.

The far-right Republicans party suffered a sharp defeat in local elections in 
the conservative stronghold of Bavaria on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
While most West German attention was focused on the East German elections, 
voters in Bavaria elected council members and mayors in the southern state. 
Though late Sunday returns were not final, projections showed that the 
nationalistic Republicans were polling only around 5% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In order to win representation in the federal Parliament in December's 
scheduled national election, the Republicans -- who liberal critics say have 
attracted neo-Nazi elements -- must poll at least 5% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
They had reached 15% of the Bavarian vote in June's elections to the European 
Parliament, and Republican strategists had said that since Bavaria is their 
power base, the party should have polled closer to 10% in Sunday's local vote. 
</P>
<P>
Their leader, Franz Schoenhuber, a former SS army sergeant in World War II, 
admitted Sunday that the Bavarian results are disappointing, saying, "I take 
the responsibility for not succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber's wife, Ingrid, ran for mayor of Munich, the Bavarian capital. She 
won only about 5% of the ballots. The city's traditional party in power, the 
Social Democrats, won the mayor's post. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Bavaria said the Republicans, who polled 7.3% nationwide 
in the European Parliament election, have probably passed their high-water 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
They have been strongly identified with Schoenhuber, a former television 
journalist, and have presented no other strong candidates. The party has also 
been rent by factional and personal feuds. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' platform, that of German reunification, has been adopted by 
all the other West German parties, leaving the Republicans with no special 
issue to differentiate them. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans had tried but failed to enter candidates in Sunday's East 
German election. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Republicans' standing in opinion polls slumped to 2.9% -- well 
under the margin needed for representation in the state and national 
legislatures.

TALKS BREAK DOWN IN GREYHOUND STRIKE

Talks between Greyhound and its striking drivers abruptly broke down Sunday 
when company officials accused union leaders of failing to negotiate and 
committing new violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The union is stonewalling on the contract," Greyhound Executive Vice President 
Anthony Lannie said in a statement. "They had nothing new for us today (Sunday) 
or yesterday while stepping up the violence." 
</P>
<P>
Lannie charged that violence continued Saturday even while the two sides were 
meeting for the first time since 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other 
Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over wages, job security and grievance 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of 
Greyhound Local Unions, called Lannie's statement "the desperate words from a 
desperate man. We clearly condemn violence and anything we can do to discourage 
our members we are doing so." 
</P>
<P>
The union presented a new proposal Saturday, but the company said it was 
unacceptable, and the talks broke off Sunday after only about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service, and the strike 
has stranded many smaller communities for which buses are the only public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
During the walkout, Greyhound says, there have been at least 14 shooting 
attacks on Greyhound buses, 46 bomb threats and numerous other incidents of 
vandalism or threats. 
</P>
<P>
Lannie charged that there were six new incidents of violence after the talks 
began Saturday, including two in Fayetteville, N.C., in which union members 
allegedly assaulted non-striking drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the trading of charges, federal mediator Paul F. Stuckenschneider said 
he was not giving up. 
</P>
<P>
"The issues remaining are serious and they are many, and it's not unusual at 
this stage of negotiations for both sides to remain very firm in their 
position," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Union President Edward M. Strait said that Greyhound never came to the 
bargaining table in good faith, and "refused to make any compromises, any 
concessions, from their previous unacceptable proposals." 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound says it has been operating roughly one-third of its buses with 
replacement and non-striking drivers. The company says about 400 union drivers 
are at work, joining 1,000 permanent replacements. The union says fewer than 
100 of its drivers have crossed the picket lines.

MAN TRIES TO AID BROTHER, IS SHOT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was shot to death Saturday night as he tried to help his brother after 
two men forced their way into the victims' car while it was stopped at a 
traffic light in South-Central Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Lucas Nunez, 22, of Los Angeles died at the scene after he was shot twice 
while trying to help his temporarily disabled brother, who had fallen, officers 
said. Jorge Nunez, 23, who wears a brace on one leg while recovering from 
surgery, was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the brothers were waiting at a signal at San Pedro Street and Gage 
Avenue when two men walked up and forced their way into the car. After ordering 
the younger Nunez to drive a short distance at gunpoint, the men pushed the 
brothers out of the car, Lt. David Powers said. When Juan Nunez bent to help 
his brother up from the pavement, one of the gunmen shot him twice, Powers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants, described by the surviving brother only as two large black men, 
then drove off in the car, a 1978 red Buick Regal (1LOP604), which has not been 
found, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, Jorge Nunez sobbed as he expressed his rage. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed my brother only to steal the car. They never even told us they 
wanted to steal it; never told us to leave the car. They are animals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge said he and his brother were returning home after watching a televised 
boxing match at a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
"We had never seen the men before, we weren't doing anything. My brother was a 
very good person, a hard worker. But those men just didn't care what they did," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers lived in a house with their parents and four other siblings. Jorge 
Nunez was not working while he recovered from his operation, and Juan Nunez, a 
construction worker, was helping to support the family. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that his mother would be too upset to have strangers in the house 
Sunday, Jorge Nunez haltingly told his story in Spanish over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so very hard for us, everybody here is very sad," he said. "But it is 
important to tell the story, so other people will know it can happen to 
anybody. These streets are very dangerous."

3.3 AFTERSHOCK RATTLES UPLAND; NO DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small earthquake rattled the Upland area early Sunday morning, but there were 
no reports of damage or injury. 
</P>
<P>
The 3.3-magnitude temblor struck at 5:56 a.m., and was centered about 3 miles 
northwest of Upland, said Bob Finn, spokesman for Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Finn said Sunday's quake is the latest in a series of more than 500 aftershocks 
to a 5.5-magnitude temblor on Feb. 28. Finn said about 40 of the aftershocks 
have been strong enough to be felt by residents in Upland and surrounding San 
Gabriel Valley communities. 
</P>
<P>
A 3.5-magnitude aftershock struck the same area on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire officials in Upland said they received numerous calls on 
Sunday's quake, but no reports of damage or injury.

7TH OF 13 CHULA VISTA JAIL ESCAPEES SEIZED; MAY BE THE MOST DANGEROUS

<P>
Police captured the seventh, and possibly the most dangerous, of 13 prisoners 
who escaped March 7 from the County Jail in Chula Vista over the weekend after 
a three-hour standoff in East San Diego, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Bell, 21, who was being held before his escape on suspicion of 
murder, surrendered to police Saturday afternoon in the attic of a two-story 
apartment complex at 3626 44th St. 
</P>
<P>
Bell is accused of murdering a La Mesa man who was drawing money from an 
automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said police received an anonymous tip regarding 
Bell's location. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrived at the location before noon and surrounded the area. The 
Special Weapons and Tactics team fired flash grenades and tear gas into the 
second-floor room where Bell was hiding. Bell surrendered peacefully shortly 
after 3 p.m. and was taken to the County Jail, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell was among the 13 prisoners who escaped; six escapees remain at large.

ROBIN HARRIS, 36; COMEDIAN ON THE RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Robin Harris, the rotund comedian known locally for his pillorying of famous 
blacks and nationally as Sweet Dick Willie in the movie "Do the Right Thing," 
has died in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
His manager, Bill Gross, said his friend and client had completed a performance 
before a sold-out crowd of 2,400 at Chicago's Regal Theater on Saturday night, 
returned to his room at the Four Seasons Hotel, and was found dead in bed 
sometime later. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office said Sunday a cause 
of death had not been determined pending an autopsy today. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 36, seemed poised for a major breakthrough in his career. 
</P>
<P>
A Times article last August had called him "one of the unheralded pleasures of 
the black community. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He was then emceeing a lineup of comedians at the Comedy Act Theater on 43rd 
Street in Los Angeles' Crenshaw District. 
</P>
<P>
To that club came members of the Lakers basketball team after home games, 
former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and various black film and TV stars. 
</P>
<P>
All were treated with equal irreverence by Harris. 
</P>
<P>
He was a little-known presence outside the black community when Spike Lee cast 
him as Sweet Dick Willie last year. The character was part of the modern-day 
Greek Chorus in "Do the Right Thing" that provided a street-smart philosophical 
underpinning to the film's biting commentary about white and black 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Willie was the memorable braggart among the three black men hanging about on a 
street corner ("Mike Tyson ain't nothin'. If I fought Tyson I'd drop him like a 
bad habit.") 
</P>
<P>
His success in that role placed him in Lee's next film, "Love Supreme," and in 
Lee's "Variations on the Mo' Bettah Blues," which is yet to be released. 
</P>
<P>
He also was featured in the recently released film "House Party," Eddie 
Murphy's "Harlem Nights" and had cut a comedy album. And he was being courted 
by several television producers. 
</P>
<P>
But it was at the Comedy Act Theater that he had become likened to a black Don 
Rickles, commenting on customers' wearing apparel ("Like that suit, brother. It 
might come back in style."), their trips to the restroom, or on his 
conversation with a white cop who stopped him one night ("You got a gun in the 
car?" Harris said the cop asked, to which he replied, "No, it's home with the 
dope.") 
</P>
<P>
Harris prided himself on maintaining his roots. He rode the bus around town and 
frequently stopped to chat with people on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get out of touch with buddies," he said last year as his 
successes mounted. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was born in Chicago and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was 8. 
Here, he said, he was encouraged to follow his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Although he weighed more than 200 pounds at his death, Harris once ran a 4:18 
mile and went to Ottawa University in Kansas on a track scholarship after 
graduating from Manual Arts High School. 
</P>
<P>
He came back to Los Angeles, worked a series of odd jobs and then gradually 
realized that what he did best was make people laugh. ("I may have had a 
two-bit job at the bank, but everybody wanted to sit with me at lunch.") 
</P>
<P>
He played a series of Los Angeles nightclubs before Lee and others helped make 
him a part of the national comedy scene. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said he gave Harris a lot of latitude in his role as Sweet Dick Willie. "I 
couldn't write that character as funny as Robin could," said Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Exetta, a son, his parents and a brother and 
sister.

A fire in the engine room of a cruise ship off Australia killed one crew member 
and injured another Sunday, but the blaze was put out before it could reach the 
1,200 passengers or disable the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
P&amp;O Sitmar Cruises, owners of the Fairstar, said a 44-year-old boiler 
attendant died after suffering burns to 75% of his body during what was to be a 
routine testing of an auxiliary boiler. 
</P>
<P>
The ship was off the New South Wales state coast and heading back to Sydney 
after a 10-day cruise when the fire occurred.

GREYHOUND TALKS BREAK DOWN AMID VIOLENCE CHARGES

Talks between Greyhound and its striking drivers abruptly broke down Sunday 
when company officials accused union leaders of failing to negotiate and 
committing new violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The union is stonewalling on the contract," Greyhound Executive Vice President 
Anthony Lannie said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"They had nothing new for us while stepping up the violence." 
</P>
<P>
Lannie charged that violence continued Saturday even while the two sides were 
meeting for the first time since 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other 
Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over wages, job security and grievance 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of 
Greyhound Local Unions, called Lannie's statement "the desperate words from a 
desperate man. We clearly condemn violence and anything we can do to discourage 
our members we are doing so." 
</P>
<P>
The union presented a new proposal Saturday, but the company said it was 
unacceptable, and the talks broke off Sunday after only about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound operates the only nationwide inter-city bus service, and the strike 
has stranded many smaller communities for which buses are the only public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
During the walkout, Greyhound says, there have been at least 14 shooting 
attacks on Greyhound buses.

PILOT DIES IN BUENA PARK CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
NEAR MISS IN FOG AT WAX MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The pilot of a small plane died this morning when his aircraft struck a power 
line while attempting to land in dense fog and crashed into the empty parking 
lot of the Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, whose name was being withheld until relatives could be notified, was 
the only occupant of the four-seat Cessna 172 Skyhawk II, said Fire Chief Sam 
Winner. He crashed about three miles from the Fullerton Municipal Airport, 
where he had been cleared for landing. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred about 6.45 a.m., as museum employees were arriving for work. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard, 'Boom! Boom!,' and the entire building shook," said Jeff Johnson, the 
museum's lighting manager. "I thought it was an earthquake, because when I ran 
outside, debris was falling from the (electrical) tower." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he ran back into the museum but returned to the parking lot about 
four minutes later to survey the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The tower was swaying," Johnson said. "And in the end of the parking lot, I 
saw a big ball of flame. I thought it was a truck on fire, but I couldn't see 
well because of the fog. So I got a little closer, about 10 feet, and I said, 
'Wait, this is a plane.' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnson ran back inside and called police. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the crash frayed several of the power lines before the plane fell 
into the southwest corner of the parking lot. The burning plane missed a tract 
of homes about 10 yards behind the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
William Pollack, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, 
said that the aircraft was originally scheduled to land at John Wayne Airport 
but that dense fog forced the pilot to abort the landing. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a low pass over the field (at John Wayne) and decided against it," 
Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot apparently was given clearance to land at the Fullerton Airport where 
visibility was near zero, Pollack said. But the aircraft later disappeared from 
the radarscope. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing we heard is that we had a call from the Buena Park Fire 
Department about a plane crash in the Movieland Wax Museum's parking lot," 
Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton airport director Roland Elder said the pilot received FAA clearance 
to be on an instrument approach to the airport. "Normally, he should have been 
about 1,100 feet high," Elder said. "Something would have had to happen up 
there before he dropped and hit the power lines." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the firefighters quickly contained the blaze, but authorities 
said initial investigations suggested that the aircraft was loaded with fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators cordoned off the crash scene this morning, as workmen from 
Southern California Edison were hoisted in hydraulic baskets to repair the 
damaged lines. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents, however, drove into the museum's parking lot to look at the 
wreckage. The aircraft, white with an orange stripe, had landed on its back. 
Its wings rested on one side. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillen said the pilot's body was badly 
charred, adding that coroner's officials would probably use dental records to 
confirm his identity.

A 23-year-old stabbing victim died this morning after he was found lying in a 
Lancaster street next to his car, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bergen of Lancaster died at 2:30 a.m. at Antelope Valley Medical Center, 
about two hours after he was found by a passer-by at the intersection of West 
Avenue J and Cedar Avenue, Deputy Chris Wahla said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen had been stabbed many times in the chest. There were no arrests, and 
deputies did not know of any motive for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Wahla said the passer-by saw Bergen lying on the ground next to the open door 
of his car.

Three teen-agers were arrested early today in connection with the fatal 
shooting of a 31-year-old man during a fight just after midnight in the parking 
lot of an all-night convenience store in Garden Grove, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
David Eugene Davenport of Garden Grove was killed by a shotgun blast about 
12:10 a.m. outside a Circle K store at the intersection of Brookhurst Street 
and Katella Avenue, Garden Grove Police Sgt. Douglas Morrill said . 
</P>
<P>
Police said Davenport was visiting a clerk at the store and followed the three 
youths into the parking lot after he suspected that they had stolen some 
merchandise. Witnesses told police that after a confrontation, one of the 
assailants took a 20-gauge shotgun out of the car and fired it at Davenport, 
Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
At about 12:30 a.m., a male and female juvenile were apprehended by Orange 
County sheriff's deputies at the Euclid Avenue entrance to the Garden Grove 
Freeway. They were in a car that matched the description of the one at the 
slaying scene, Morrill said. Cesar Maua Sustait, 19, of Santa Ana was arrested 
shortly afterward at his Santa Ana home on Euclid Avenue, Morrill said. Police 
also believe they have recovered the shotgun used in the murder.

Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) signed the necessary forms and paid the

Kassebaum, 57, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had said in 
May that she would seek reelection, but she kept even her staff members in 
suspense until the official announcement at her Washington office. The reason 
for the suspense was that Kassebaum had pledged to serve only two terms in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Kassebaum, the daughter of 1936 Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon, 
declined to rule out a 1996 reelection bid and said she got herself in trouble

<P>
Former President Jimmy Carter today accused Israel of violating the human 
rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories and said such harsh 
treatment helps fuel the Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, on a three-day visit to Israel as part of a Middle East tour, cited as 
abuses the Israeli detention of Palestinian activists without trial, house 
demolitions as punishment and what he termed "excessive use of firearms" 
against Arab demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are talking about is an authoritative government that is in charge 
that is depriving the people under its control of their basic human rights," 
Carter told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I think the intifada is being perpetuated partially by the abuse of 
the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
Intifada is the Arabic word used by Palestinians for their 27-month revolt 
against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan and the Gaza Strip 
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War. Israel annexed East Jerusalem as part 
of its capital and rules the territories through a military government. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers or civilians have killed 665 Palestinians since the uprising 
began in December, 1987. An additional 198 Palestinians have been killed by 
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities. 
Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Carter made his comments to reporters after a half-hour meeting with the board 
of the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories. 
The group, founded by liberal Israeli politicians and academics, monitors 
activities in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
Carter cited figures from the Israeli center indicating that "almost one in 
four, 25%, of all the adult males among the Palestinians have been arrested" at 
one time or another since the uprising began. 
</P>
<P>
He was also critical of Israel's "administrative detention" procedures, which 
allow the jailing of Palestinians without charges or trial for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has said force is necessary to put down Palestinian violence and that 
actions such as detentions and house demolitions deter anti-Israeli activities. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Chaim Herzog met leaders of parliamentary factions to 
determine which of the major parties, Shimon Peres' Labor or the Likud bloc of 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, has enough support to form a new coalition. All 
Labor ministers quit the unity government with Likud last week after Shamir 
fired Peres after differences over proposed peace talks with Palestinians in 
Cairo.

Libya has detained several people suspected of setting a fire that severely 
damaged a chemical plant that U.S. officials say produced poison gas, Libya's 
ambassador to Italy said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Rahman Shalgam said the fire was apparently set by "a member of the 
technical staff at the factory," the Italian news agency ANSA reported. 
</P>
<P>
The person responsible will be "executed in the same place where the fire took 
place," he told a news conference for Italian journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Shalgam did not say how many people were detained or give their nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out Wednesday in the plant at Rabta, about 60 miles southwest 
of Tripoli. Libya says the factory produced medicines, but the United States 
and West Germany have charged that it produced poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
Libya has said it suspects that Israel, the United States and West Germany were 
behind the fire. All three countries have denied involvement.

Yves Saint Laurent, one of the world's best-known couturiers, has been 
hospitalized to recuperate from exhaustion, his fashion house said today. 
</P>
<P>
Saint Laurent, 53, will not attend the presentation of his ready-to-wear spring 
collection on Wednesday, and his doctor advised him to abandon his business 
activities for several weeks to rest, a statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospitalization was ordered Saturday by Dr. Michael Prendeville after Saint 
Laurent underwent a thorough medical examination that disclosed no signs of any 
infectious diseases.

Japan put a satellite into orbit around the moon today, joining the United 
States and the Soviet Union in the accomplishment, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's first lunar satellite, Muses-A, completed two missions, a swing-by 
flight designed to boost its speed and enlarge its elliptical Earth orbit, and 
the placement of a smaller satellite in lunar orbit, said the government's 
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. 
</P>
<P>
"Both tests were completely successful, and we deeply thank U.S. and Japanese 
scientists for their cooperation in the probe," said an institute spokesman, 
who was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's chief scientist, Kuninori Uesugi, said the release of the 
smaller basketball-sized experimental satellite into orbit around the moon, 
required extraordinary accuracy, "in baseball terms . . . comparable to hitting 
the eyeball of a bug in the outfield from home base."

Gerber Products Co. announced today that it will establish an after-tax reserve 
of $8.3 million, or 22 cents a share, to consolidate its Gerber Childrenswear 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation will involve eliminating certain non-strategic product lines 
and reducing excess manufacturing capacity, said Al Piergallini, Gerber's 
chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
"When the restructuring of the Gerber Childrenswear segment is complete, we 
will have a company with lower sales but one that is significantly more capable 
of contributing to shareholder value through better operating results in both 
the short and long term," he said.

Panic selling spurred by a strong U.S. dollar swept through the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange today, sending the major index tumbling to its third-largest daily 
loss, as individual and institutional investors dumped stocks across the board. 
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Nikkei Average of 225 selected issues, which fell 55.20 points 
Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15%, to 31,263.24 -- for its lowest 
closing level in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Exchange Price Index of all major listed shares 
fell 92.98 points to 2,326.23. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has given up on the market," said Hidetada Yoshida, general manager 
of the equity trading department of Kidder, Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. had a large impact on the market, 
selling an estimated 70,000 shares of Nikkei Average stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more serious than Black Monday," Yoshida said, "because the October, 
1987, crash was due to Wall Street's weakness, but Tokyo's plunge is due to 
weak fundamentals."

CONISTON, UNIONS TO TRY UAL BUYOUT; 
</P>
<P>
PROXY FIGHT: JOINT EFFORT HOPES TO BUY AIRLINE'S PARENT FOR MORE THAN $3.8 
BILLION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Three unions and one major shareholder announced a joint effort today to buy 
United Airlines' parent corporation for more than $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The offer, based on a plan to install new directors in a shareholder proxy 
fight, shattered a lull in the prolonged takeover maneuvering for UAL Corp. It 
included a commitment by the unions to cut labor costs and not to strike. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.8 billion is about 40% less than a debt-financed offer that collapsed 
five months ago, touching off a major tumble in the stock market and raising 
the first big doubts about the future of the corporate takeover craze of the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston Partners, a New York takeover firm that has invested in UAL and has 
long demanded changes to boost the stock price, disclosed details of the joint 
plan with the pilots, machinists and flight attendants unions of the 
Chicago-based airline, the second largest in the country behind American 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
It said they plan to lobby for shareholder proxy votes in favor of electing a 
new slate of directors at UAL's April 26 meeting, and the directors will try to 
force the company to agree to the takeover proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Stockholders would receive $150 in cash and $25 in securities, as well as 
non-voting common stock amounting to 25% of the total in the company, the 
proposal said. The unions would own the remaining 75%. 
</P>
<P>
Based on UAL's 21.8 million shares outstanding, the offer would be worth about 
$3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
UAL was trading at about $142.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange before 
the announcement, then shot up to $151. The shares have traded as low as $121. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of the company, said in a statement that the board of 
directors was prepared to consider the Coniston-union proposal and would meet 
promptly to discuss it as well as other unspecified alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how Coniston and the unions intended to finance the takeover. 
But their announcement said new labor agreements would be negotiated that would 
include no-strike commitments and "result in substantial labor cost savings." 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of a debt-financed $300-a-share offer for UAL on Oct. 13 is 
considered one of the major events in the corporate takeover era because it 
instilled deep skepticism about whether such deals would continue. The Dow 
Jones industrial average plunged 190 points that day. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent collapse of the junk-bond market practically stopped all 
takeover deals because it eliminated the major source of financing. Takeovers 
for airlines in particular are now considered riskier because of uncertainty 
about the economy and the overall health of the airline industry.

Command Communications Inc. said today that talks have ended on previously 
announced plans to sell radio stations in Houston and Dallas and a Texas-wide 
radio network for $86.5 million to Evergreen Media Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Command said the decision reflects "the continued strong performance of the 
properties and the brightening prospects for the Texas economy." 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based company said it had "secured additional sources" of both 
equity and bank financing and now plans to make acquisitions in Texas and other 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Command signed an agreement in January to sell KRLD-AM of Dallas and the Texas 
State Radio Networks to Evergreen Media for $58.5 million. Under a separate 
deal, Evergreen would have acquired KODA-FM in Houston for $28 million from the 
Sillerman Companies, a New York-based investor in Command and other broadcast 
properties.

morning on newsstands farther away from the centers of its three markets.

BROKAW PINS TAIL ON 'NEW HOLLYWOOD'

There was a time when they used to drive convertibles in Hollywood. Now they 
drive convertible debentures. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of this march of the conglomerates on the movie world are being 
examined Wednesday in an NBC News special, "The New Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
It's anchored by Tom Brokaw, who can recall the remnants of the Old Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
He first saw it in 1966, when he began at KNBC-TV in Burbank as the new anchor 
in town. 
</P>
<P>
His memories: "In those days, it seemed more stately than it does now. Maybe 
I'm deluding myself, but it seemed to me there was at least a residue of the 
old elegance of Hollywood. Now it's Hustle City." 
</P>
<P>
When he was new in town, he recalls, assorted sages "were predicting that the 
era of the big studios was over, that they were going to roll over and die, and 
the little independent films were taking hold in many ways." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not even sages can be right all the time. 
</P>
<P>
The "conglomerization" of Hollywood has tended to make the talk there guarded, 
cautious and corporate, a far cry from yesteryear's lavish babble. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Brokaw says, he was surprised that today's Hollywood inmates, including 
Oscar candidate director-writer Oliver Stone, were willing to talk to him about 
the New Hollywood and its bottom-line brigade. 
</P>
<P>
But he drew a blank with one of hamlet's major movers and shakers, Michael 
Ovitz, a party often identified as a superagent who handles superstars. 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw said he talked by phone with Ovitz, chairman of Creative Artists Agency, 
"and he simply would not cooperate. Mike Ovitz said he would be happy to talk 
to me off the record if I wouldn't tell anybody that we were talking. So I 
thought I'd pass."

Famed X-rated entertainment producer Artie Mitchell remained hospitalized for

Mitchell, 44, was at the beach Sunday with three of his children, his brother 
Jim, and two of Jim's children when several of the youngsters got caught in the 
tide. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty ugly," said Mitchell, who was in fair and stable condition 
recovering from hypothermia at the University of California at San Francisco 
Medical Center. "I'm really happy to be alive. I almost kicked off in the 
emergency room . . . but it looks like I'm going to pull through it."

The Mitchells operate Mitchell Bros. Film Group and are the city's most famous 
promoters of adult films and theaters.

A Montclair, N.J., man who has accused comedian Eddie Murphy of stealing his 
screenplay for the movie "Harlem Nights," has a criminal record for theft, 
fraud and drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
But Hafiz Farid, 37, an aide to a Newark, N.J., city councilman, says he is an 
"example of reformation." 
</P>
<P>
He told the Newark Star-Ledger that "the man you refer to does not exist. I 
have risen above my past to emerge as an example to young people. My life is an 
open book." The newspaper found that Farid, who changed his name from Darryl 
Anderson, was convicted in 1972 and 1973 of drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1979, he was sentenced to four years in prison for masterminding a 
scheme that netted seven defendants thousands of dollars in student loans and 
grants. New Jersey state police records also show 1977 convictions for credit 
card theft and receiving stolen property. Farid has filed suit against Murphy, 
claiming he gave the comedian a manuscript in 1986 that was later used as a 
rough draft of "Harlem Nights."

Ann Landers says "a lot of people need professional help," including those who 
write excessively long letters to advice columnists. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran agony aunt said she skimmed through 1,500 letters on a flight 
Friday from Chicago to Seattle where she spoke to the Northwest Women's Show.

Letters on old themes, like those from teen-agers asking how to get more 
attention from a potential mate, can be boring, she admitted. And, naturally, 
she prefers letters that are reasonably concise.

"Sometimes I'll get people who write 14 pages or so, but those people are 
probably psychotic, though," she said. "I tell them they need professional

One recurrent theme is whether toilet paper should be hung over the top or down 
against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very compulsive about it," she said. "The toilet paper needs to be hung 
down along the wall. I'll actually rearrange it myself if I'm over at someone's 
home and I see it hung over the top."

"When older men star in movies, they have love affairs with much younger 
women," said the 49-year-old actress. "Look at Paul Newman in his movies. I 
don't think it's fair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the eyes of the people who are making the movies, and it's in society, 
too, which equates desirability with youth. The only answer is to produce the 
movies yourself, believe in the roles and fight for them."

Former Mayor Edward I. Koch takes on old foes with his customary vitriol in a 
collection of letters and newspaper columns from his 12-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
"Always give as good as you get," Koch wrote his successor, David Dinkins, who 
defeated him last year. 
</P>
<P>
That letter is one of several in "All the Best: Letters from a Feisty Mayor," 
due out in April. 
</P>
<P>
On the scandals that shook his third term, Koch wrote to Dinkins, "The most 
searing pain of my twelve years was learning I had been betrayed by people who 
were corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"I was despondent. I must confess, on several occasions when I was alone, I 
wept. It was hard to get myself out of bed in the morning."

A 10-year-old boy died of cardiac arrest after being hit in the chest by a 
pitch during a Little League baseball game, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Wojick went into cardiac arrest when the baseball struck him in the chest 
near his left armpit during a game Sunday, said Sgt. Gordon Davis of the 
Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The incident happened in the fourth inning at the Citrus Park Little League 
field in Hillsborough County, Davis said. Wojick was up to bat and the pitch 
was wild, said Wojick's coach, Fred Bloomingdale. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody dreamed that it would have come to this," Bloomingdale said. "He lost 
his breath, and everyone thought he had the wind knocked out of him," he said. 
"He was gasping for air . . . and then he went down on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers from a nearby fire rescue station, along with paramedics watching 
another game, ran onto the field and administered cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, Davis said. Wojick was flown by helicopter to St. Joseph's 
Hospital in Tampa about 15 miles away, where he died.

The Mariners open their spring training camp today in Arizona for players in 
the area, with the official opening set for Tuesday now that the players' 
lockout has ended. 
</P>
<P>
Team spokesman Dave Aust said the first formal workouts with all players on 
hand would be held after equipment is hauled by truck to Tempe, Ariz., probably 
Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The lockout ended Sunday with agreement between major league owners and the 
players' union. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can get down to the business of playing baseball," said Mariners 
President Woody Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand a lot of adjustments to the normal routines have to be made, but 
we have no doubt that our ballclub will be ready to go whenever everybody else 
is." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long wait, and I think this is like lifting some huge weight off 
all of us," Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "Now we can get to work." 
</P>
<P>
Before the settlement was announced, new club owner Jeff Smulyan said he feared 
an extended stalemate would hamper his group's efforts to turn around a team 
that never has had a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
"Other towns, other teams have tradition, histories of success. There is a good 
chance their fans will forgive and forget," he said. "In Seattle, we are in a 
building situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been trying to turn things around, to build a winner and tradition. We 
can do this, but this is no way to start."

Guard Dale Ellis has been fined for missing the Seattle SuperSonics' team 
flight to Oakland for Sunday's game against the Golden State Warriors, Sonics 
Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said. 
</P>
<P>
Bickerstaff, who met with Ellis on Sunday, would not disclose the amount of the 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis caught a later flight to the Bay Area on Saturday. He turned in his best 
performance since returning to the roster March 10, hitting 11 of 16 field goal 
tries and four of six three-point attempts to score 30 points in the Sonics' 
121-116 victory over Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis missed 27 games because of three fractured ribs he suffered in an auto 
accident Jan. 12.

Former auto racing champion Stirling Moss suffered a broken thigh when he was 
hit by a car today while driving a motor scooter in central London. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors inserted three metal pins in the 60-year-old former Grand Prix driver's 
thigh bone, publicist Linda Patterson said.

The car allegedly ran a yield sign and hit Moss, who was going 20 m.p.h.

"I have been told the recovery process will be a slow one -- about six months," 
Moss said in a statement.

Moss crashed at 90 m.p.h. during a race at Britain's Goodwood track in 1962. He 
was dragged unconscious from his car, remained in a coma for three days and was

Donald Fehr walked into the baseball commissioner's office at 12:30 p.m. 
Saturday. About 17 1/2 hours later, the union chief walked out with a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Just like that, baseball went from war to peace. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced like other big peace treaties, at Versailles -- the 
Versailles Room of the Helmsley Palace hotel. And when it was over, Fehr was 
asked if the fight was worth it for just 15 players. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure it was worth it for 15 players," he said, perspiration dripping from his 
unshaven cheek. "If the union is going to do its job, the players have to 
support each other. . . . Even if it's only a few people in a small category." 
</P>
<P>
The union won salary arbitration for about a sixth of the players in the two- 
to three-year group. For months, owners refused to move off their position that 
they would not go below the three-year level. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, management gave a hint of change when it asked the union to make 
computer projections of different formulas. But its proposal on Friday made no 
mention of the two- to three-year players. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the union came back with a proposal that would make 25% of those 
players eligible in 1990 and set a sliding scale for the rest of the contract, 
with 40% of those players eligible in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The Player Relations Committee -- Bug Selig of Milwaukee, Jerry Reinsdorf of 
the Chicago White Sox, Carl Pohlad of Minnesota, Fred Wilpon of the New York 
Mets, John McMullen of Houston and Fred Kuhlmann of St. Louis -- caucused for 
about four hours. Fehr went for a walk around mid-town Manhattan with his 
brother while the union awaited a response. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:30 p.m., the committee for the first time moved off its position that no 
two-year players should be eligible, offering 10% of that class each season. 
</P>
<P>
"Within minutes we came back," union lawyer Lauren Rich said. They offered 18% 
in the first year, 21% in the second, 33% in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, conveying its decisions through Deputy Commissioner Stephen 
Greenberg, came back and offered 12% a year. The union countered at 20% and 
again there was a long debate while owners deliberated. 
</P>
<P>
"We were up there I don't know how long," Fehr said later, "and there was maybe 
one hour of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 p.m., the committee meeting broke and Greenberg went with Fehr into 
the conference room next to Vincent's office. Within half an hour, they agreed 
to 17%. But neither would say who suggested the figure. 
</P>
<P>
"It sprung forth as if from Zeus' head," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
It was about 10:30 p.m., and the other details of the agreement had to be 
written down. Word of the settlement leaked out in the next hour and at 1:18 
a.m., Vincent walked into the Versailles Room with American League President 
Bobby Brown and most of the committee to make the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the sides hurriedly patched together a memorandum of settlement and 
then couldn't agree on what they had agreed on. Because of that, the agreement 
was never signed. 
</P>
<P>
So, as Vincent and Greenberg went off to a restaurant for a late meal, union 
lawyers went back to the office and spent the night typing and faxing drafts to 
the commissioner's office, where Fehr remained. The fax machine at the 
committee's office broke down, and the copier at the union broke too. 
</P>
<P>
As dawn broke over Manhattan, the lawyers finished dotting the "i's" and 
crossing the "t's." 
</P>
<P>
At 5:54 a.m., Fehr and O'Connor walked into the committee's conference room to 
sign the inch-high document. Then they walked across the street to the 
Versailles Room to say their work was complete. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what happened in 1985," Fehr said, "no one on our side was going to 
walk out of there until it was done."

CITY TO TURN NEW LEAF ON OLD TREE LAW; 
</P>
<P>
HEDGE: PROPOSED CHANGES TO HEIGHT LIMITS COULD CAUSE SPITE WARS IN HUNTINGTON 
BEACH NEIGHBORHOODS, RESIDENT SAYS.

<P>
Jerri Hesprich had hoped her crusade would save thousands of tall trees in the 
city. But a proposed solution that goes before the City Council tonight would 
only make a bad situation worse, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"This could bring spite wars by neighbors all over the city," Hesprich 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a quirk in city law that declares trees over six feet tall illegal 
if they are used along property lines as a hedge. 
</P>
<P>
Hesprich, whose back yard on Garden Circle is bordered by Italian cypress trees 
ranging from 20 to 30 feet tall, learned of the tree-height law last fall when 
a neighbor complained to the city. Hesprich subsequently was served with a 
notice to top all her trees to a maximum of six feet. A professional tree 
expert, however, told Hesprich and her husband, Glen Hesprich, that chopping 
the trees down to such a height would kill them. 
</P>
<P>
The Hespriches, in desperation, appealed to the City Council last November. 
They found a sympathetic ear in Councilman Don MacAllister, who expressed 
surprise at the tree-height law. "If we enforced that ordinance strictly, we'd 
have to cut down trees all over the city," MacAllister said. At MacAllister's 
urging, the council unanimously passed a resolution putting a moratorium on the 
tree-height law and asking the city staff to propose a change in the law. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes before the council tonight. In effect, it would put all 
allow tree hedges taller than six feet to remain intact, unless someone 
complains. But if someone complained about tall trees, the change would 
authorize the affected property owner to seek a use permit that would legalize 
the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Geri Ortega, chairwoman of the city Planning Commission, said the proposed 
change would provide for an orderly way of protecting property owners on both 
sides of a tree dispute. She said the tree owners would have possible relief, 
while neighbors would still have protection against trees that they felt cut 
out views or sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega said she opposes a grandfather clause that would legalize all existing 
tall-tree hedges in the city. "In some cases trees 18 to 25 feet high could 
block an entire ocean view, or any view," she said. "And in some cases those 
trees could have so much shade that they'd kill a neighbor's lawn. They could 
be a very bad nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
Hesprich claims that the Planning Commission's proposed change would only tempt 
Huntington Beach residents into battles with their neighbors, using tall trees 
as their ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be an endless spite war," she said. "And it would cost people trying 
to defend their trees an awful lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Applying for the permits and obtaining architectural drawings required to keep 
the trees could run into the hundreds, and possibly thousands, of dollars, 
Hesprich said. And the dispute could still wind up in court. 
</P>
<P>
Hesprich said she will urge the council to resolve the issue simply by removing 
the word hedges from the height limit. She said the city could still provide 
for intervention in cases where trees, or other types of hedges, caused genuine 
"health and safety" problems. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega said she does not agree with Hesprich's proposal. "I am hoping the City 
Council will accept the unanimous recommendation of its Planning Commission," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged, however, that a lively public hearing and debate are likely 
to precede the council's vote tonight. "It's become quite an emotional issue," 
she said.

STREET SMART: GETTING THEIR TRAFFIC SIGNALS CROSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I cannot understand why traffic lights in Orange County and southern Los 
Angeles County are not better synchronized. There are places where traffic 
lights are only a few hundred feet apart, and still no one in the 
transportation departments seem capable of getting these signals set to keep 
traffic flowing. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true of freeway underpasses, where the conditions are 
deplorable. Whoever installed the electric "loops" that detect cars on the 
roadway has done a great disservice to the motorist. They do nothing but impede 
the flow of traffic, rather than keep it moving. The left-turn arrow and 
pedestrian buttons also slow things down. Why don't they just harmonize the 
signals and forget these useless gimmicks? 
</P>
<P>
Alvin J. Butcher 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
Yes, figuring out traffic signals seems akin to predicting weather patterns. 
One day your favorite thoroughfare issues an endless stream of green lights. 
The next, it'll be nothing but red. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a method to this occasional motoring madness. 
</P>
<P>
As you note, most Orange County signal lights are connected to wire loops in 
the pavement that electronically detect when cars are waiting at a stop light. 
This setup is known as a "traffic actuated" signal-light system, said Steven M. 
Hogan, transportation division manager for the county Environmental Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic-actuated signals operate much like the old "fixed-time" systems, which 
have a clock that switches lights every 30 or 45 seconds. Fixed-time systems 
were fine, except in situations when one had to stop at a red light and wait 
seemingly forever even though no cars were on a cross street. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the two systems lies primarily with the wire loop 
detectors, which feed extra information about an intersection and trigger 
lights only when traffic dictates. With the additional data, the 
traffic-actuated setup is supposed to work all the better -- or so it goes in 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
In the real world, it is hard to ensure that signal lights stay in a harmonized 
pattern, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical glitches can wreak havoc (motorists should call local traffic 
authorities if they run across a signal they are sure is malfunctioning, Hogan 
said). Pedestrians triggering the crossing lights can also cause a signal to 
stray from the synchronized pattern for up to five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the synchronization of signal lights begins to deteriorate as 
congestion increases. Even under the most free-flowing conditions, many 
motorists don't travel at the speed limit, going either too slow or too fast 
and thus missing a green light or hitting the red. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Orange County's varied topography, particularly in the southern 
half of the county, has resulted in winding streets on which signals are very 
difficult to coordinate, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
On top of all that, there are troubles where streets and freeways meet. Traffic 
signals on streets next to a freeway are controlled by the state Transportation 
Department, which carries the prime responsibility of ensuring that traffic is 
able to safely move onto and off of the highway. Unfortunately, those lights 
often don't mesh with signals on thoroughfares sweeping toward the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
But some hope is in sight on the freeway front. Hogan said transportation 
officials with the county, various cities and Caltrans have started to work 
together to better coordinate these often discordant systems. 
</P>
<P>
Left-turn signal lights are another matter. Ideally, these lights are timed to 
interact with traffic so oncoming cars do not sit at a red light, Hogan said. 
But that is not always the case, especially when signal lights are knocked out 
of sequence by pedestrians crossing or mechanical malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities, most notably Los Angeles, have installed "permissive-protective 
signals" in the left-turn lanes, Hogan said. These signals feature two 
different green lights. A green arrow goes on when left-turing cars begin to 
back up in the turn pocket. When traffic is lighter, a round green light 
permits cars to turn left when the intersection clears of oncoming cars. This 
lengthens the time a signal stays green on each street. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan said Orange County officials have steered away from permissive-protective 
signals because of safety worries. Accident investigators report that some 
drivers become confused by the signals, turning across traffic when they should 
be yielding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although signal lights will always cause grumbles, there should be some 
improvements in Orange County in the years to come. This year, the county will 
launch its "Super Streets" program with work on Beach Boulevard. Hogan said 
signals along the street will be fine-tuned to offer better synchronization, 
giving motorists headed both north and south an improved chance of catching a 
green light instead of running into red after red. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Your Jan. 29 reply to an anti-helmet advocate makes a good case for the value 
of wearing a motorcycle helmet, and I agree with everything you said. I'd just 
like to add a few points. 
</P>
<P>
Even more sobering than the fact that 70% of California's motorcycle fatalities 
last year involved un-helmeted riders is the fact that fully 92% of all 
motorcycle accidents involve riders who are either inexperienced or untrained. 
</P>
<P>
What should also be factored in is the element of irresponsibility that a high 
percentage of younger riders exhibit, like going too fast for the conditions, 
being under the influence of alcohol, violating a right of way or simply not 
understanding how to control the machine. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that these accidents will happen regardless of whether the 
rider is wearing a helmet. And while helmets can protect against fatalities 
that result from head trauma, they won't make the motorcyclist a better rider. 
Training, and training alone, is the most effective way to prevent the 
accidents that take lives. 
</P>
<P>
Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I have over 20 years' professional 
experience with motorcycles -- as a road racer, race trainer, author of two 
books on racing technique and founder of the California Superbike School. 
</P>
<P>
Not until this state requires mandatory training for all riders under age 27 
will we in California see a significant decline in fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Code 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
Some very valid points. A little tutoring can go a long way to make a person a 
better driver, whether that's in a car or on a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Under current California law, persons under 18 have to take a course from the 
California Motorcyclist Safety Program, which has centers scattered around the 
state. For information, call (800) CC-RIDER. 
</P>
<P>
But turning 18 doesn't necessarily infuse a person with instant maturity. As 
you suggest, the state might want to take a look at extending its instructional 
requirements to include neophyte motorcyclists with even more birthdays under 
their belts. Then they can head out on the highway in safety.

FAMILIES DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR A MEMBER ACCUSED OF GOING

As Pastor Robert B. Town stood at the lectern of the Jacob's Well Christian 
Centre one recent Sunday, he surveyed a roomful of about 150 church-goers, half 
of whom he later described as former drug users, gang members or prison 
convicts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have faith in God!" Town told them, his voice booming over a 
loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Y-e-a-h!" replied the congregation, most of them wearing T-shirts, jeans and 
hopeful smiles as they looked up from rows of folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
From a makeshift sanctuary in an industrial warehouse here, Jacob's Well is a 
Christian church catering to street people and low-income families. Earlier 
this month, it was thrust into the news when police accused a member of going 
on a violent rampage, stabbing his mother and her boyfriend, then killing the 
3-year-old daughter of another church member. 
</P>
<P>
The accused, Michael Robert Pacewitz, a 21-year-old with a history of drug use 
and mental illness, said in an interview after his arrest that he indeed 
carried out the attacks. Once regarded by church officials as a model convert, 
Pacewitz contended that he had been driven to violence by the devil and that 
while carrying out the attacks he was under the influence of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Pacewitz awaits a preliminary hearing on murder and attempted murder 
charges, Town and others at Jacob's Well want to distance themselves from the 
suspect and his statements. 
</P>
<P>
"What he did had nothing to do with this church," Town said. "We tried to help 
him, and he was doing very well when he was here. But he relapsed back into 
drugs and we're sorry for that." 
</P>
<P>
Russ Spittler, a religion professor at the Fuller Theological Seminary in 
Pasadena, says churches such as Jacob's Well play a crucial role in meeting the 
spiritual needs of people who otherwise might feel they have no place to 
worship. Although street people are welcomed in many more established churches, 
Spittler said, "research has shown that people are comfortable in church with 
people like themselves." 
</P>
<P>
But Spittler and other experts question the effectiveness of any church in 
dealing with members who may have deeply rooted mental disorders that can lead 
to drug abuse or other serious criminal problems. 
</P>
<P>
In his interview from jail, Pacewitz said church officials at Jacob's Well had 
encouraged him to quit taking medication for his mental illness and instead 
rely solely on his faith in God. 
</P>
<P>
Town strongly denied that Pacewitz was told any such thing. The pastor added 
that new converts, in fact, are told to consult with a doctor before ceasing 
any medication. Town explained that "we tell them that God can heal them" but 
stressed that Jacob's Well -- which follows a doctrine of traditional Bible 
teaching -- has never held itself out as a drug rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Town, 36, grew up in the small town of Wickenburg, Ariz., and attended a 
charismatic church in his youth. He said he dropped into a "partyhead" mode 
during his young adulthood and drank alcohol and used drugs. About 10 years 
ago, when Town was running an exterminating business, he was saved and 
dedicated his life to preaching, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He spent four years studying under a pastor at his church in Arizona, then 
moved his wife and two young children to Orange County, where he opened the 
church now known as Jacob's Well. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the original congregation of about 50 has grown to about 250. The 
church began in his home, then moved to a small shopping center, then a year 
ago to its current location in the 2000 block of Raymer Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Although the pastor says many former criminals attend the church, there have 
been few problems aside from an occasional theft. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're getting saved, I don't worry too much about them," Town said, 
adding that he has five burly ushers ready to intervene should any trouble 
occur during services. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, some of the church's neighbors complained that members of Town's 
congregation were too enthusiastic in their proselytizing, blared rock music 
and held loud revival meetings late at night. In a newspaper interview then, 
Town downplayed the controversy, saying his parishioners only wanted to "tell 
about the love of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
At the opening of one recent service, a Christian rock band led a rendition of 
"Let's Clap for Jesus," while Town, standing atop a carpeted altar, clapped and 
sang along with his congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Then Town presided over a wedding ceremony for two church-goers before 
delivering a sermon about good versus evil, ending each sentence with a hearty 
"amen!" The congregation cried back "amens" and "hallelujahs." 
</P>
<P>
At the close of services, the band struck up "He's a Savior of My Soul, My 
Jesus" as Town called to the altar anyone wishing to be saved that morning. 
Slowly, they came forward until a dozen church-goers kneeled in tears at the 
altar as Town murmured in a soothing voice: "God loves you this morning." 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews, several Jacob's Well church members said they were able 
to quit drug habits solely by believing in God. Outreach counselor Todd 
Maloney, for example, said he kicked an eight-year cocaine and alcohol 
addiction after being saved by the church four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you what, God did a miracle," said Maloney, 30, who goes to low-income 
neighborhoods in North Orange County each weekend to convert transients and 
other people. "I had a $2,000-a-week coke habit; I had lost a business, a house 
and was being evicted from my apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Andy St. Pierre, 26, a church usher, said he had been a cocaine addict since 
age 10 before being converted by the church 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave my life to Jesus . . . and here I am," said St. Pierre, who supervises 
one of two houses the church offers to members who have no other place to live. 
Pacewitz had lived with St. Pierre in one house on West Commonwealth Avenue in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Churches can be effective in fulfilling spiritual voids that contribute to drug 
abuse, said Arne Benson, assistant administrator of the Starting Point of 
Orange County, a Costa Mesa clinic that offers both inpatient and outpatient 
drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But Benson and other experts say that -- apart from a person's religious faith 
-- medication, psychiatric counseling and even hospitalization are vital to any 
successful treatment of mental problems that make it difficult to kick a drug 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
Benson said drug abuse usually stems from emotional, psychological and 
biological factors, and that while religion may aid the first two categories, 
he believes it does nothing to address the last. 
</P>
<P>
"Any treatment that does not address recovery for all three factors is doomed 
to failure," Benson said.

YALE BRIDGES BURNING ISSUE IN IRVINE VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
JUNE BALLOT: AFTER 12 YEARS OF DEBATE, VOTERS WILL DECIDE WHETHER TWO 
PEDESTRIAN OVERPASSES WILL BE WIDENED TO ACCOMMODATE AUTOMOBILES. CITY 
OFFICIALS' JOBS ARE ALSO ON THE LINE.

<P>
In a city that has recently approved a precedent-setting ban on chemical 
pollutants, thoughtfully debated reallocation of national defense spending and 
lobbied hard to build Orange County's first transportation monorail, a 
startlingly mundane and parochial issue has moved to the center of this year's 
municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Yale overpasses, two Yale Avenue pedestrian bridges proposed for widening 
to allow vehicles to use them, have become the unlikely objects of Irvine 
political machinations in recent months, raising tempers and setting the stage 
for a climactic political showdown in June. After 12 years of rancorous debate, 
voters finally will decide the fate of the bridges on the June 5 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, many city officials -- including some bridge opponents -- believe 
that the proposal to widen the bridges will pass, though most are cautious 
about making predictions this early. 
</P>
<P>
"The Yale overpasses are a very big issue in this community, and many people 
feel that they've been wronged," said Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who 
supports the proposal. "You're going to see plenty of action on this between 
now and June." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran, an opponent of the measure and Sheridan's rival in the 
mayor's race, agrees, predicting that the issue -- along with the related topic 
of neighborhood preservation -- will dominate much of the campaign debate, if 
not its outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The two proposed vehicular overpasses -- one over the San Diego Freeway, the 
other over the Atchison, Topeka &amp; the Santa Fe Railroad tracks -- are 
included in the city's General Plan, but the council voted in 1988 to study 
amending the plan so the bridges would stay as pedestrian overpasses. Angered 
by that vote, overpass proponents circulated petitions, which call for the 
bridge widenings to remain in the General Plan, though only as two-lane roads 
instead of four-lane ones. 
</P>
<P>
The petition gathered 7,002 signatures, enough to force the council to put the 
matter to a vote. In response, the council put a second bridge measure on the 
ballot, allowing residents to reject widening altogether, rather than simply 
choosing between two and four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners who forced the matter argue that wider bridges will alleviate 
traffic on the city's main arteries by giving residents an alternative route 
for short trips. Opponents retort that gains in convenience will come at the 
expense of safety, particularly of children who use the pedestrian overpasses 
to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are sharply divided, and council meetings have become a regular forum 
for furious debate. Opposing sides cannot even agree on the city's "impartial" 
ballot analysis of the bridge proposal, and proponents are now threatening to 
sue for a new one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a very emotional issue, probably more of an emotional issue than 
any that the city has faced in recent years," said Gary Vanderpol, treasurer of 
Yale Action, the residents' group pressing for the bridges to be widened. 
</P>
<P>
The bridges have been the object of debate since the late 1970s, and passions 
flared so high in 1987 that nearly 1,000 residents packed the largest public 
hearing in Irvine's history to debate the overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
But despite years of deliberation, even the most basic details are in dispute: 
Opponents say it will cost about $9 million to expand the bridges; supporters 
put the figure at about half that. Opponents say the bridges will cause traffic 
and pedestrian hazards; proponents maintain that traffic on other streets will 
be alleviated and that accidents, injuries and pollution actually would 
decrease. 
</P>
<P>
What increases the stakes in the debate this time around is that residents will 
cast their votes for mayor at the same time they settle the bridge dispute. 
Most city political observers agree that the mayoral campaign's central issue 
could be the bridges and all they have come to represent. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue goes to the heart of defining what a neighborhood is all about," 
Agran said, citing questions such as traffic and safety. "These are issues that 
have been swimming around for 10 years or more, and now they are coming to the 
surface." 
</P>
<P>
On the council, sentiment runs strongly against the overpasses. Agran is 
vociferous in his opposition, and three of his colleagues share his position. 
Sheridan is the lone exception, as she is on many issues. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people counted on these bridges being built," she said. "Then, in the 
last election, the mayor said he would take those bridges out of the General 
Plan. That's made the other side very mad." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, who refers to the council majority as "one vote and three echoes," 
predicts that the overpass issue could prove crucial to the outcome of the 
mayor's race, though she added that many other questions separate her and Agran 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
As Yale overpass feuding has grown more intense, opponents of the two-lane 
bridge proposal show signs of concern. Councilman Cameron Cosgrove, a bridge 
opponent who is up for reelection, agreed with other council members when he 
said he hopes that voters will resist the temptation to cast "single issue 
ballots." Candidates, he and other council members stressed, embody a host of 
positions beyond the Yale overpass question.

TENNIS COURT SITE CHANGES PROPOSED

<P>
Basketball courts at a school run by Christ Lutheran Church would be moved away 
from neighbors and fenced under a proposal by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a resident's complaints of excessive noise, the commission 
recommended changes to the courts at 820 W. Imperial Highway, where the church 
has an elementary and junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would move the courts onto the church's parking lot, fence them and 
reduce one of the two courts to a half-court to preserve parking space. 
</P>
<P>
Church school principal Larry Lebrecht conceded that the courts were built last 
summer at a site different than the one approved in 1982 but said safety 
considerations dictated the change. He said the original location was next to 
Imperial Highway, where children might run into the street for balls. 
</P>
<P>
Lebrecht said he could agree with all the planning staff's recommendations 
except for the one cutting the size of the second court in half. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Carl Clausen said: "I like the church's program . . . However, the 
whole layout was done under certain conditions, and one was that property 
owners would have certain kinds of peace to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission's decision can be appealed to the City Council within 
the next 10 days. BONNIE SINNOCK

THIRD SCHOOL HIT BY TEACHER BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boycott by teachers which began last week at two Huntington Beach City School 
District campuses has spread to a third school. 
</P>
<P>
Dwyer Middle School teachers announced that they are suspending activities such 
as grading students' papers at home, tutoring after school and coordinating 
intramural sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
They also plan to boycott scheduled field trips and on-campus educational 
fairs, said Sharon Boudreau, a Dwyer teacher and president of the district 
teachers association. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott is patterned after actions taken last week by teachers at Sowers 
Middle School and Eder Elementary School, and union officials said they expect 
it to expand to all eight of the district's schools this week. 
</P>
<P>
The action aims to pressure district officials to resume contract negotiations 
that have been stalled for some months. Teachers are seeking pay increases and 
guarantees that they will not have to shoulder any future increases in health 
benefit costs. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Supt. Ron Brown assailed the action as one "that should be kept out 
of the classroom . . . in a way that does not impact the children." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a similar boycott preceded a one-day districtwide strike. Union 
officials have said they have not ruled out the possibility of a walkout, while 
district administrators said they have begun recruiting extra substitute 
teachers. JOHN PENNER

HIRING HALL WILL BE TOWN MEETING TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A town-hall meeting is planned for Thursday to discuss operations of a hiring 
hall for day laborers. The talk will cover who can use the hall and how it will 
benefit the community. 
</P>
<P>
English and Spanish brochures on the center will be available at the meeting, 
scheduled for 7 p.m. at El Modena Community Center, 18672 E. Center St. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring hall, or resource center as city officials are calling it, is 
scheduled to open Saturday and will be open from 6 a.m. to noon, Monday through 
Friday, and 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Saturdays. The trailer that will be used for 
the center is expected to arrive this week at the center's site at McPherson 
Road and Chapman Avenue, city spokeswoman Jane Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty days after the center opens, the Police Department will begin enforcing 
two ordinances that ban the solicitation of work on city streets. The ordinance 
carries maximum penalties of a $500 fine and a six-month jail sentence.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES LITERACY; 
</P>
<P>
FOR MOST, ILLITERACY REMAINS HIDDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MASEL WESTERFIELD, Masel Westerfield is the president of the Central Orange 
County Literacy Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The most important thing I learned was that I'm not stupid!" 
</P>
<P>
These words were written by an Orange County resident who, at that time, had 
been in literacy classes for 1 1/2 years. She had always wanted to learn to 
read, but it was not until she was 40 years old that she got the courage to do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
While watching the movie "Bluffing It," she was reminded of herself. She had 
been bluffing it for 30 years. It was a handicap in everything she did. It 
stopped her from going places, ordering in restaurants, reading her Bible, 
personal letters, everything. 
</P>
<P>
She tried public adult education, but because of the large class sizes, it 
didn't work for her. Then she began attending volunteer classes offered by the 
Central Orange County Literacy Council and, for the first time in her life, was 
learning to read and write. She is now a nurse's aide. 
</P>
<P>
The story of this Orange County woman has a happy ending, but not all Orange 
County's illiterates are so fortunate. It is conservatively estimated that of 
the more than 2.2 million people in Orange County, more than 100,000 adults are 
functionally illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
There are many different definitions of illiteracy. Is it a total inability to 
read or write anything? Is it less than a fifth-grade reading level? Is it less 
than an eighth-grade reading level? 
</P>
<P>
When an individual's reading and writing abilities are inadequate for him to 
function competently in today's print-oriented world, that individual is, for 
all practical purposes, functionally illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
The literacy requirements for today's high-tech civilization are well above 
those of even a few decades ago. Many people with formerly adequate skills are 
in a precarious position. 
</P>
<P>
The problem remains hidden for most. Would you willingly admit to your best 
friend -- never mind your boss -- that you can't do a particular job of paper 
work because you can't read well enough? The stigma is too great. 
</P>
<P>
Most illiterates' ways of hiding their problems serve them fairly well up to a 
point. But what if they are offered a promotion involving more reading and 
writing than they can handle? They are likely to find an excuse not to take it 
or quit rather than reveal their "terrible secret." 
</P>
<P>
Why can't these people read and write? Why didn't they learn as children as the 
rest of us did? 
</P>
<P>
Some children have trouble learning by the methods used in many schools. They 
don't qualify for special help, and many classrooms are overcrowded. Some 
children have undiagnosed hearing and vision problems. Because of difficulty at 
home, some children do not learn. Some families move a great deal, and an 
elementary school child can lose six months with each school change. Children 
of migrant workers are especially hard hit. Some had illiterate parents who 
passed on their indifference to the value of learning to their children. 
</P>
<P>
Illiterate people come from a variety of social and educational backgrounds. 
Some are economically secure and often have high school diplomas. Some are 
regularly employed without diplomas and with low basic skills. Others are 
irregularly employed with almost no marketable skills. As many as 80% of all 
juveniles who appear in court are functionally illiterate, as are more than 65% 
of incarcerated adults. 
</P>
<P>
How can you recognize people who are low-level or non-readers? Their methods of 
hiding their problem can be ingenious. They become very adept at memorizing. 
Some excuses they use are: "I'll have my wife look at the form." "I left my 
glasses at home." "I don't have time to help my children with homework." "I 
don't have time to read this form now." "My handwriting is bad." 
</P>
<P>
When referring a friend or acquaintance to a literacy class, focus on the 
opportunity to improve his reading and writing, not to learn to read or write. 
I would suggest you call the Central Orange County Literacy Center first to 
verify hours, days and location before approaching the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Be sensitive to the feelings of these low-level or non-reading individuals. 
Treat the situation matter-of-factly and openly with a positive and supportive 
attitude.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ARTS FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
FOR TAXPAYERS, NOT A PRETTY PICTURE; 
</P>
<P>
SETTING REASONABLE SELECTION STANDARDS IS THE LEAST THAT SHOULD BE DONE TO CURE 
ILLS OF THE FEDERAL ARTS ENDOWMENT PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA ROHRABACHER, Dana Rohrabacher is a congressman representing the 42nd 
District, which includes portions of Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives has begun the reauthorization process for the 
National Endowment for the Arts. As this process continues through the spring 
and summer, the taxpayers have good reason to ask tough questions as to the 
legitimacy of this agency and its decision making process. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of arts funding came to the fore last year when working Americans 
discovered to their dismay that they were subsidizing through their taxes such 
so-called art as "Piss-Christ," depicting a crucifix submerged in the artist's 
urine, as explicit and bizarre photographs featuring nude children, acts of 
sodomy and sadomasochistic sex. This is not a debate over artistic nudes. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what is said by defenders of the NEA, who repeatedly told us that 
only two of the thousands of grants are questionable, new examples are 
emerging. Recently, a series of live performances by porno queen Annie Sprinkle 
at the Kitchen Theater in New York City was indirectly subsidized by the NEA. 
An exhibit which just ended at Illinois State University by David Wojnarowizc 
certainly is in this category. In the catalogue that accompanied this 
taxpayer-financed show was a depiction of Jesus Christ as a heroin addict, 
complete with a rubber tourniquet and syringe stuck in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
In times when we are hard pressed to find funds for health care for our 
elderly, prenatal care for poor women and school lunch programs, spending tax 
dollars on art is questionable, at best. Spending our tax dollars on trashy art 
is outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
As one might predict, the artist community's reaction to attempts to set 
standards is to cry "censorship." Who's kidding whom? We are not debating 
whether the federal government ought to pay for artistic folly, no matter how 
much it may offend the morals of taxpayers or denigrates. No one debates 
America's artists' self-proclaimed rights to photograph and urinate on whatever 
they wish -- as long as it's on their own time and on their own dime. The idea 
that any "artist" has a right, on the basis of the First Amendment protection 
of free speech, to collect our tax dollars for sleaze is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. government is going to underwrite art, choices must be made about 
where to spend those tax dollars. Of course, as far as I'm concerned the 
federal government should be out of the arts altogether. And I am somewhat 
surprised by the reaction of some artists who argue for such government 
involvement in the artistic realm. History teaches us that when the government 
gets its hands on the arts, like in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Nazi 
Germany, freedom, creativity and the search for truth and beauty suffer. 
</P>
<P>
So why do many artists insist on a federal subsidy program? It seems to me many 
recipients of NEA funds would be hard-pressed to attract customers or voluntary 
support. These questionable artists are more confident of support from the 
avant-garde art elite in the peer-review panels of the NEA, people who are not 
investing their own money. And don't let NEA Director John Frohnmeyer convince 
you these panels, like the legal jury system, are imperfect but the best we can 
do. If similar peer-review system were followed in American courtrooms, we 
would only have lawyers on juries. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if Frohnmeyer is so big on having the peer-review panels modeled on 
juries, then non-artist, non-arts professionals, everyday working Americans 
ought to be asked to sit on NEA panels and make the decisions about art 
funding. I can guarantee the decisions would be far different from what they 
are now. 
</P>
<P>
If one wants to see censorship in the arts, one need only see how the NEA 
excludes beautiful, more traditional art. Realistic art or pro-religious art 
suffers even as weird, freak art triumphs. This seems so systematic that 
several realist artists are planning to sue the NEA. The NEA clique's rule has 
had a powerful and negative influence on art in America, according to several 
prominent art critics. 
</P>
<P>
Short of abolishing this Soviet-style committee system, Sen. Jesse Helms and I 
propose that the NEA director and the peer review groups -- the same people who 
already make decisions about what art to fund -- operate with certain standards 
of decency in making their decisions. In other words, we're asking them to come 
to their own conclusions about whether a project in question is obscene, 
indecent, anti-religious or racist; and if the answer is "yes," don't subsidize 
it with our tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
At this time, such criteria are not part of the process. The NEA decision 
makers are totally unaccountable to the moral standards of the people forced to 
pay the bill, and that's the way they want it to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The dollars spent on art are far better left in the individuals' pockets for 
them to spend on the art they appreciate. But, if Uncle Sam insists on making 
artistic decisions for us, the least we should do is set some reasonable 
standards on how our taxes are spent. One doesn't have to be a prude or a 
puritan to see that the federal government shouldn't be spending our tax 
dollars on some of the trash the NEA calls art.

'BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT' GUILTY OF WEAK PLOT LACKING IN SUSPENSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Beyond Reasonable Doubt," which marked the playwrighting debut of British 
novelist Jeffrey Archer, had its U.S. premiere over the weekend in a Laguna 
Playhouse production at the Moulton Theatre. And it's a potboiler. 
</P>
<P>
Should there have been any doubt? Probably not. Archer's huge output of 
best-selling sagas -- "Kane and Abel," "The Prodigal Daughter" and the rest -- 
has never been prized for literary quality. 
</P>
<P>
What is surprising, though, is that this courtroom drama turns out to be not so 
much a whodunit as a whydunit -- and a tepid one at that, climaxing with a 
sentimental flourish instead of an unexpected twist. 
</P>
<P>
The real mystery is that "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" set box-office records when 
it opened in London's West End 2 1/2 years ago and has been on the boards there 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In the first act, we get a lengthy taste of the Old Bailey, where Britain's 
most distinguished criminal lawyer, Sir David Metcalfe, is on trial for the 
murder of Lady Millicent, his terminally ill wife. Details of the case unfold 
as prosecutor Anthony Blair-Booth, Sir David's old rival, puts a parade of 
witnesses on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
The police believed that Lady Millicent had died of cancer until her 
housekeeper turned up and accused Sir David of poisoning his wife with an 
overdose of her potentially lethal medicine. According to the housekeeper's 
testimony, Sir David came home drunk, verbally threatened Lady Millicent and 
dropped the fatal pill into her tea. 
</P>
<P>
The loyal family solicitor reluctantly reveals that the estate Sir David has 
inherited is worth 1 million. And the defendant concedes that at the time of 
his wife's death, his broker was hounding him for several hundred thousand 
pounds to cover the margin on an ill-advised stock purchase. 
</P>
<P>
It gives nothing away to note that the heart of the case actually lies beyond 
the circumstantial evidence in the relationship between Sir David and Lady 
Millicent. The housekeeper claims that it was less loving than it seemed, 
largely evident in Sir David's nasty outbursts of temper. The solicitor 
testifies that it was a union of total mutual devotion. 
</P>
<P>
The second act clarifies the nature of the marriage by taking us back before 
the trial to a dinner party at the couple's home in Wimbledon, then leads us up 
to the death scene and provides a postscript to the trial. But the weak plot 
lacks suspense. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the first act suffers from far too much procedural tedium -- court 
jargon, repetitive hand-on-Bible oaths, judicial instruction on the law -- 
while the second act strains for breeziness with clubby anecdotes, brittle 
chitchat and windy poeticizing. 
</P>
<P>
Archer tries to incorporate some entertaining characters, writing ethnic and 
class types that audiences will recognize as transparent cliches. The judge is 
a chiding curmudgeon, the housekeeper a judgmental crank, the prosecutor an 
upper-class twerp. Lady Millicent, in addition to dying like a swan, is the 
perfect hostess. And Sir David, master orator among legal eagles, has a 
fondness for things Welsh -- particularly Dylan Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the Laguna production is well-dressed. It has white wigs and 
black robes in the Old Bailey and black ties and drink trays at Wimbledon. But 
the tone is bland, the players colorless. Most can't even be taken for British. 
</P>
<P>
The best performances are George Woods' as Sir David, Betsy Paul's as the 
housekeeper and David Paul's as the solicitor. 
</P>
<P>
P.S.: Would somebody please pull the plug on the hearts-and-flowers piano 
music?

MUSTY MATERIAL FAILS TO PROP UP COMIC BRUCE BAUM AT TOP SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The knock on Bruce Baum has always been his reliance on props, that he can't 
float a show without those buoys of low humor. 
</P>
<P>
As is his way, Baum propped himself up throughout his 45-minute performance at 
the Hyatt Regency Alicante's Top Secret Comedy Club Friday night, pulling out 
one visual exclamation point after another. 
</P>
<P>
He donned his wacky rock band glasses (Kiss had to be the inspiration), he 
displayed his drawing of bearded sperm, he twisted his rubber record, he 
twirled his inflatable globe, he turned on his cymbal-playing monkey, he . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's Baum's style, and you expect it. What was off-putting Friday was how old 
all these sight gags are. Baum's been using the same props for a while now, 
many reflecting a dated point of view. He needs to visit the toy store again. 
</P>
<P>
Baum should also update much of his verbal material. Several times he used 
jokes linked to impressions that have long evaporated in the public mind. Like 
when he did a prop-heavy, staccato interpretation of a few music videos, most 
from the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
All were pretty forgettable back then, and it wasn't surprising that some 
didn't register as Baum frantically tried to find a satiric tempo. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he brought up that stale Coors commercial featuring Mark Harmon 
standing in a stream. Baum reminded the audience that the actor makes this big 
point about how Coors uses only the finest water. But Baum is thinking, "Hey, 
get your feet out of my beer!" 
</P>
<P>
Never a great joke, but it probably was reasonable when the ad's imagery was 
fresh a few years ago. What about all the current commercials worth bruising? 
</P>
<P>
In defense of Baum, the small crowd at this small club did seem charmed by his 
performance. Most apparently were familiar with his career (a few murmured the 
punch lines a beat before Baum delivered them) and may have seen this as a live 
reel of the comic's greatest hits. A passel of gags did go back to the late 
'70s, when Baum started performing stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
And there was something pleasantly nostalgic about his bit on '60s "alternative 
theater," where he assumed a very cool, very serious persona, lit his face with 
a flashlight, and dealt in a little nihilistic poetry babble. 
</P>
<P>
That was weird, and it worked. Baum's best moments surfaced after he slipped 
into a bizarre mode, with a timeless orientation minus the props. Like his 
reflections on going to the dentist: it's not the pain of the drill that 
bothers him, but "when the drill gets stuck and the dentist spins around and 
around." 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the zoo is unnerving: Why do they always put the paranoid animals 
next to the cages with the hyenas and mockingbirds? 
</P>
<P>
All this talk about rap music also got him thinking. Blacks didn't invent it, 
whites did, but they call it "square dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, these were brief flourishes in an otherwise creaky dance. Baum, a comic 
who has shown he knows the steps, should look for some new partners.

A CHECKLIST FOR HIRING NEWPORT MUSEUM DIRECTOR;

I am the very model of a modern art museum head. 
</P>
<P>
 I know the folks with money and can quote the latest eight-page spread 
</P>
<P>
 From journals coffee-table size, in tones that always sound well-bred ... 
</P>
<P>
 (with apologies to William S. Gilbert's lyrics for "The Pirates of Penzance") 
</P>
<P>
The museum is mum. The search firm isn't talking. All we know for sure is that 
James Demetrion, director of the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture 
Gardens, has turned down the job. But that doesn't mean people on the outside 
can't offer up a wish list of what Newport Harbor Art Museum should be looking 
for in its new director -- the man or woman to replace Kevin E. Consey, who 
left in November to lead the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. I think the 
successful candidate should have: 
</P>
<P>
1. Respect from the museum profession and art world nationally and 
internationally. That goes without saying, now that Newport has become a major 
player on the national art museum scene. It also has a bearing on the hiring of 
a new chief curator to replace Paul Schimmel, who leaves for the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles next month. Much depends on the mutual rapport 
and respect between director and chief curator. People tend to hire individuals 
who share similar points of view. A respected director is likely to attract and 
select a strong candidate for this pivotal position, charged with determining 
the focus and direction of the museum's exhibition schedule. 
</P>
<P>
2. Contemporary art savvy. This one is more tricky than it looks. Many people 
interested in contemporary art are happy to greet the latest work by, say, 
Billy Al Bengston or Ed Moses. Conceptual art, on the other hand, may strike 
them as peculiar, off-putting and difficult. That's OK if you're a collector, 
but it's not at all OK if you're the director of a contemporary-art museum. 
</P>
<P>
By tacit agreement of the people who display art in major museums and those who 
review it major magazines, the most exciting art being produced today is -- 
broadly speaking -- involved in examining ideas about the way images and 
objects function in the context of mass culture. (For example, "OBJECTives: The 
New Sculpture," a show curated by outgoing curator Paul Schimmel that opens 
April 8 at Newport Harbor, contains objects that are reflections of a culture 
in which good and bad taste, as well as historical styles in art and design, 
have become whimsically interchangeable.) Any Newport Harbor director worth his 
salt should be a knowledgeable and wholehearted supporter of conceptual art -- 
which also probably means being on the younger side of the art world generation 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
3. A track record in orchestrating museum building campaigns. This also goes 
without saying. Although Consey was new to the task, the job of collecting $50 
million to build and endow Newport Harbor's new building is sufficiently 
daunting to call for a director experienced in dealing with the challenges and 
frustrations of fund raising and construction. 
</P>
<P>
4. Relative youth, high energy. In the gung-ho, frisky environment of Southern 
California, youth is a plus. A director in his or her 30s or 40s is also likely 
to be more active and interested in "the art of the now" than someone who 
secretly or not-so-secretly prefers the work of generations past. 
</P>
<P>
5. Charm -- specifically the ability to get on well with people in a position 
to donate impressive sums of money to the museum -- and the wholehearted 
respect of the museum's trustees. As Fats Waller supposedly told the woman who 
asked what jazz was, "If you gotta ask, you don't know." The kind of charm that 
appeals to museum supporters involves more than wearing smartly cut suits or 
hosting terrific parties. The magic mix combines authority, deference, humor, 
tact, warmth, polish and effortless social skills. 
</P>
<P>
6. Flexibility and an innovative viewpoint. Although its temporary exhibits 
encompass a full range of modern and contemporary art from the United States 
and Europe, Newport Harbor has been dedicated during its 28-year history to 
collecting only postwar California art. Nowadays, this goal seems parochial. 
Who really cares whether artists were born here or live here so long as their 
work is strong? A flexible, innovative museum director won't be afraid to 
explore all kinds of new ways of doing things -- such as abandoning the 
California emphasis in lieu of some more globally aware way of setting Newport 
Harbor apart from other contemporary museums on the national scene. 
</P>
<P>
7. A commitment to scholarship. One of Consey's great legacies to the museum is 
his emphasis on the importance of the museum catalogue as the permanent record 
and reference source for exhibitions. Consey encouraged the production of 
catalogues with substantial, serious essays by experts in the field. The new 
director should have a similar history of overseeing the production of 
catalogues that add measurably to the world's knowledge, as opposed to pretty 
picture books. Score more points if the director has actually authored a 
respectable, zero-fluff-content book or catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
8. An attitude of non-interference in the work of the curatorial staff. This 
becomes particularly important if the person's contemporary-art-savvy quotient 
is deficient (See No. 2). If that's the case, the director should be willing to 
serve in a purely administrative capacity and allow the curatorial staff to 
proceed -- unencumbered except for necessary votes of confidence from the board 
-- in the business of creating and selecting exhibitions and making acquisition 
choices. Another Consey legacy is his hands-off policy with regard to curating, 
and it has served the museum well. 
</P>
<P>
9. A realistic outlook not rooted in self-aggrandizement. Particularly if the 
director is a younger person, it's likely that Newport Harbor will represent an 
important steppingstone in career terms. That's only natural. But the museum's 
interests shouldn't be subordinated to the iron whim of personal ambition. 
</P>
<P>
10. Public-speaking skill and the ability to deal with the press as a candid 
straight-shooter. Today, as any chief corporate officer knows, you can't expect 
your public relations department to shield you from contact with the public and 
the press. A director who can sound intelligent but not stuffy, who can alter 
the tone of a talk to suit the listener without changing the facts, and who 
doesn't shirk from uttering the truth even when it hurts would be a great asset 
to Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
If you've read this far, you get a reward: the names of the two people who -- 
according to the art world's gossip hot-line -- are the top candidates for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 is rumored to be Henry Hopkins, 61, director of the Frederick R. Weisman 
Collection in Los Angeles and former director of the Ft. Worth Art Museum 
(1968-74) and the San Francisco Museum of Art (1974-86). No. 2 is rumored to be 
Julia Brown Turrell, director of the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa. Turrell was 
formerly curator (1981-83), senior curator (1983-86) and adjunct curator 
(1986-87) of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. She is married to 
James Turrell, the noted "light and space" artist.

<P>
Stay tuned.

<P>
Fred Graham's socks and underwear are lying on the bed. The remains of one 
room-service meal are on the bureau, and another pot of coffee is on its way 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, the former Fulbright scholar turned lawyer, lawyer turned journalist, 
and journalist turned failed local TV anchorman, is on a book tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still fresh," he says happily, but he doesn't look it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Fred Graham was at the top in journalism -- the New York Times 
correspondent at the Supreme Court. The son of a Southern preacher, he had 
attended Yale on scholarship and later studied at Oxford. He had become a 
lawyer and then Special Assistant Secretary of Labor, then joined the Times. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, at age 41, he did something nearly unthinkable. He quit the New York 
Times and went into television. Like it or not, he told colleagues, the tube is 
how we communicate, so we'd better take it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
As the law correspondent for CBS News for 15 years -- the first one in network 
television -- Graham was there for the "golden age" of network TV news. He 
explained Watergate and the Burger Court to 20 million Americans a night. His 
bosses had to rein in his show-business tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
Then it came apart. In the 1980s, cable TV started shrinking the revenues at 
the networks, and suddenly CBS News was pushing something called 
"infotainment." Management wanted stories with a lot of quick, different shots, 
called "elements," and emotional impact or "magic moments." Graham couldn't get 
on "The Evening News" anymore with stories about law or the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in 1972, Graham saw change coming again. Economics were forcing a 
decline in the importance of network news. Local news was ascending. When 
someone offered, Graham moved back to his hometown of Nashville to become a 
local anchor, the most prominent of several network stars to make a similar 
switch at the time. Within two years, Graham was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"Meaningful happy talk news," he said in the interview, "was a contradiction in 
terms." 
</P>
<P>
This journey -- Graham's life in television -- is the story told in his book, 
"Happy Talk." Graham lays himself bare and takes the blame often for things 
gone wrong. Yet the preacher's son also wants to give lessons about television. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have gone through is a metaphor for everything that has happened" in 
television, says Graham, now 58. And basically he's right, though the networks 
still do cover the law, and one, NBC, still has a lawyer doing it in Carl 
Stern. 
</P>
<P>
One of those lessons is that there is a limit to how substantive local news can 
be, Graham says. His station in Nashville had hired him to try for substance. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to do it by making the chatter between stories more meaningful. The 
difficulty was obvious from the first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The story involved a lawsuit by the state, which wanted to test a federal 
regulation restricting trucks on local highways. 
</P>
<P>
Graham turned to his co-anchor and added that this appeared to be a ploy by the 
state to get out of enforcing a federal rule that was unpopular. She looked at 
him, said, "That's interesting," and proceeded to read a story about a local 
child's liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Graham's station tried. The news consultants, who already had coached Graham to 
become more competent, were summoned back from Iowa to help "facilitate 
meaningful happy talk." They encouraged taking risks. Graham's co-anchor 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen a lot of you guys come and go," she told the consultants. "I have 
a reputation to protect, and I am not going to take chances. If Fred wants to 
take chances, let him do it." 
</P>
<P>
The station created a new broadcast at 6 p.m. for Graham with a different 
co-anchor who did want to take risks. No one watched. A new group of TV 
consultants or "news doctors" were hired. Graham was let go. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't regret the attempt. For one thing, he is still convinced that the 
era of network news may be past. 
</P>
<P>
With cable, the networks sharing their news footage with local affiliates and 
declining network ratings, "It is possible that one or maybe all of the network 
evening newscasts will not make it into the 21st Century," Graham says. "A big 
affiliate like Los Angeles could make more money by dropping the network news 
(and programming that time itself). If one does and gets rich, then it's going 
to be a chain reaction." 
</P>
<P>
These pressures were one of the things that drove Graham out. Another was that 
economics seem to have moved the networks toward having just a few celebrity 
reporters to cover most big stories. By necessity, they are generalists. "They 
could not be expected to report with the kind of detailed knowledge and sense 
of perspective that a specialist would bring." 
</P>
<P>
And these sorts of pressures are part of what in the 1980s estranged Graham and 
other former CBS colleagues from an old friend, Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
"After Dan moved up to the role of anchor and company heavyweight, he seemed to 
feel that the simple Texas lad image was no longer adequate," Graham wrote. "He 
appeared to be groping for a new persona that was a better fit. As a 
consequence, both on camera and off, Dan seemed to be posing." 
</P>
<P>
There is a paradox to Graham's story about being banished from network news and 
then bombing in local news. It is a celebrity memoir. Graham is hitting all the 
major shows and the phone is always busy. Television made Graham famous, and 
well paid. And it is making his book a success. But it has also banished him -- 
at least to cable. 
</P>
<P>
Graham is involved now with Time Warner in launching a news channel devoted to 
the law, experimenting with the idea that, in the era of cable, there may be a 
place for narrowly specialized channels where substantive, in-depth journalism 
could thrive. 
</P>
<P>
As he writes in "Happy Talk": 
</P>
<P>
"Television is the people's medium, and if journalism is going to continue to 
reach the grass roots, much of it will have to be done through the tube. 
Despite the disarray of the networks, the taint of sensationalism, the appeal 
of tabloid-TV and the fender-bender tendencies of local news, serious 
journalists must find roles in television news, or surrender the most potent 
medium to trash and sleaze. 
</P>
<P>
"I had not come up with the formula for how to do this -- particularly in local 
TV news -- but I was not sorry I tried."
