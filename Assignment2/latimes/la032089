An offer by IBM Corp. to pump millions of gallons of water with low levels of 
industrial solvents to Santa Clara Valley households has been met with 
skepticism by environmentalists and water district officials. IBM says the 
treated water from its South San Jose property, now being dumped, contains low 
levels of chemical solvents, but is well within the state limits for drinking 
water supplies. Under the proposal, IBM would pump from 600 to 1,300 acre feet 
a year into the Snell Pipeline, which carries water for the Santa Clara Valley 
Water District. "I am not comfortable with the citizens of Santa Clara County 
drinking that water," said Joe Judge, chairman of the district. But Steve Morse 
of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board said, "As far as 
we can see, there's little or no health risks."

A skull found by a hiker near the Lafayette-Orinda border has prompted an 
investigation into whether it is that of murder victim Luis Reyna, whose 
headless body was found in the same area last year, Contra Costa County 
sheriff's officials said. Reyna, a popular waterfront commissioner, disappeared 
July 18, the same day he told family members he was going to meet commission 
colleague Enrique Zambrano, who vanished the same day as Reyna. Zambrano had 
been charged with the attempted murder of a UC Berkeley professor and his wife 
early last year.

 -- A group of charities honored White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu at a 
weekend dinner, and President Bush dropped by briefly to add some praise to 
that from the ballroom full of guests. The hosts of the dinner were the St. 
Jude's Children's Research Hospital and the American-Lebanese-Syrian Associated 
Charities. Sununu is of Lebanese descent, and among the guests at the black-tie 
affair was entertainer Danny Thomas, also of Lebanese extraction, who founded 
St. Jude's hospital in 1962. With Sununu and Thomas was another person of 
Lebanese descent, United Press International reporter Helen Thomas. Bush spoke 
of his "deep affection for Lebanon" and referred to the turmoil there. " . . . 
I expect every American looks at Lebanon today with agony in his heart and 
concern, hoping that he or she in some way can find a way to make a 
difference," the President said. Bush also said he had learned a lot about his 
top aide in the first months of his Administration and told the crowd: "He is a 
class act."

 -- Victor Emmanuel, son of the last Italian king, renewed an effort to end his 
43-year exile and return from Switzerland with his own son, Emmanuel Filiberto, 
who he hopes can attend an Italian military academy and university. Italian 
newspapers published a letter from Emmanuel to Italian President Francesco 
Cossiga in which he recognized the Italian republic for the first time, but he 
also said he was not relinquishing his claim to the throne last held by his 
father, King Umberto II. Italy's 1947 constitution forbids the entry of 
Emmanuel and his heirs, and to change the ban would require approval of a 
two-thirds majority of both houses of Parliament. The widow of Umberto II, 
former Queen Maria Jose, has visited Italy occasionally since the government 
lifted the ban on her return in 1987.

 -- The University of Iowa's Hancher Auditorium launched an effort to silence 
some discordant notes during its concerts. Ailing audience members are being 
asked to squelch their coughs with free cough drops from the ushers, or to 
retire to a soundproof observation room where they can wheeze and sneeze 
without ruining the music. Japanese pianist Mitsuko Uchida was disturbed by 
persistent coughing from the audience during her performance at the hall in 
Iowa City. So the program for a recent appearance by violinist Isaac Stern 
urged the crowd, dubbed the Hancher Hackers by a local newspaper, to keep 
things quiet. The hall's marketing director, Judith Hurtig, said the effort 
seems to have worked, with performances now notable for the audience's 
stillness. DAVE JOHNSON

An overwhelming majority of Americans say they would buy organically grown food 
if it cost the same as fruits and vegetables treated with pesticides or 
synthetic fertilizers and nearly half would pay more, according to a new 
survey. The strong preference for chemical-free fruits and vegetables showed up 
in a survey conducted even before the recent scare over poisoned grapes from 
Chile and apples treated with Alar. The Louis Harris Poll conducted for Organic 
Gardening magazine found that 84.2% of those surveyed would choose organically 
grown food if given the choice, and 49% said they would pay more for organic 
food.

The Soviet General Staff had warned the Kremlin against large-scale 
intervention in Afghanistan in December, 1979, arguing in vain for a more 
limited operation, a top Soviet soldier said. Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, who 
headed the Soviet Defense Ministry's operational group in Afghanistan for four 
years, also criticized as a "demagogue" Babrak Karmal, who became Afghan 
president after the Soviet troops moved in. Varennikov, now deputy defense 
minister and commander of Soviet land forces, told the weekly Ogonyok: "It is a 
fact that the General Staff was against the idea of sending the troops to 
Afghanistan up until the time when it was decided."

The Japanese ruling party's candidate won a third term as provincial governor 
in an election considered a test for the scandal-embroiled Liberal Democrats. 
With 99.5% of the vote counted in Chiba prefecture, Takeshi Numata had 969,221 
votes to 783,280 for his opponent, Shoji Ishii of the Japan Communist Party. 
Numata was elected by a 3-to-1 margin in 1985, and the sharply narrower victory 
Sunday could indicate trouble for the Liberal Democrats in voting this summer 
for half of Parliament's upper house. The ruling party has been stung by a 
scandal involving the sale of Recruit Co. stock to politicians.

Israeli troops and allied Lebanese militiamen traded artillery fire with 
pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim guerrillas in south Lebanon. Police said three 
civilians and three militiamen were wounded. They said the brief exchange 
flared after a 75-strong armored Israeli force and fighters of the 
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army entered the village of Dallafeh, just beyond 
Israel's self-designated security zone, in search of pro-Iranian guerrillas. 
Elsewhere, Muslim militiamen fired at least 20 rockets at Lebanon's Christian 
port of Juniyah, radio stations reported. Security sources said the rockets 
were aimed at stopping the passenger ferry service between Juniyah and Cyprus.

MUBARAK: 'NO MORE WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak, promising "there will be no more wars as of today," 
raised the Egyptian flag over Taba after Israel relinquished control of the 
disputed strip of beach on the Sinai Peninsula. Mubarak was on a European tour 
when the last Israeli policeman left the 250-acre strip overlooking the Gulf of 
Aqaba last Wednesday. Israel had retained control of Taba when it pulled out of 
the rest of Sinai in 1982; an international arbitration panel awarded the strip 
to Egypt in September. Before flying to Taba, Mubarak laid a wreath at the tomb 
of President Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated by Muslim extremists in 1981. It 
was Sadat who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.

'THIS IS ZEV'S TURF,' 3 YAROSLAVSKY CHALLENGERS DISCOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's three opponents usually place an 
empty chair at his spot on the dais when he skips joint campaign events. 
</P>
<P>
The chair is supposed to symbolize Yaroslavsky's absence from the 5th District 
race, but it also says a lot about the frustrations of running against a 
powerful incumbent who appears to be in no real danger of losing his seat. 
</P>
<P>
Despite resentment over intense commercial development in such areas as 
Westwood and his well-known desire to be mayor instead of a councilman, 
Yaroslavsky's opponents have so far been unable to rally much support in their 
bids to unseat him. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Zev's turf," said one political operative who asked to remain 
anonymous, referring to the fact that Yaroslavsky grew up in the Fairfax 
District and has never moved away. "There is no serious constituency against 
him out there." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, 40, certainly looks confident as he travels about the district in 
his unwashed Buick, meeting constituents, listening to people's problems and 
enjoying the measure of celebrity that comes from 14 years of public life. 
</P>
<P>
There was early speculation that he might be vulnerable to a grass-roots 
challenge from Laura M. Lake, 42, an environmental activist who inspired 
comparison with Ruth Galanter, who two years ago upset City Hall veteran Pat 
Russell in the neighboring 6th District. But most observers now say it is 
doubtful that Lake can muster the kind of support needed to force Yaroslavsky 
into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Even Lake's strongest supporters are privately expressing their doubts. "We 
don't really expect Zev to lose," one of them said. "We just hope that the race 
is close enough to scare him into being more responsive." 
</P>
<P>
The other challengers are Ryan Snyder, 34, a transportation consultant, and 
Jack McGrath, 43, a former Yaroslavsky aide running as a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Yaroslavsky's strength lies in the makeup of the district. The 
predominantly white, heavily Jewish area that takes in Westwood, Century City, 
Bel-Air, the Beverly-Fairfax area and parts of Sherman Oaks, Studio City and 
North Hollywood is said to be tailor-made for the councilman, who started his 
career as an advocate for Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky also enjoys the benefits of incumbency, the recognition that comes 
from leading the fight for such high-profile issues as Proposition U, the 
city's landmark slow-growth measure, and a seemingly inexhaustible fund-raising 
base, as he proved when he collected more than $1.5 million for a mayoral race 
that he backed away from at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to demonstrate the breadth of his support, Yaroslavsky kicked off 
his campaign by publishing a list of endorsements from more than 25 of the 
district's past and present neighborhood leaders, representing a majority of 
the district's influential homeowner groups. He dismisses his foes as 
lightweights, but at the same time insists that he is running a serious race. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky is expected to send out at least three mailings before the April 11 
election. He also has a yard sign program and a telephone bank, and has even 
spent time canvassing in the bucolic communities of the southern San Fernando 
Valley, which he inherited during redistricting two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At one house he promised to secure a new stop sign for a couple worried about 
speeding traffic, then entertained their son with his impression of Sesame 
Street's Bert and Ernie. At another he talked basketball with the unbridled 
enthusiasm of a Chick Hearn. At a third he smiled stiffly as a man observed 
that he has gained weight since his campaign pictures were taken. 
</P>
<P>
"All my advisers say I'm nuts," Yaroslavsky said. "They say there's no need to 
do this. But the public wants you to be accessible, and I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
But accessible to his opponents he is not. He follows the conventional path of 
most well-entrenched incumbents in refusing to appear at most events featuring 
lesser-known challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder has been canvassing since August and has published an impressive 20-page 
booklet offering detailed solutions to such district problems as smog, traffic 
and congestion but has been unable to raise more than a few thousand dollars, 
according to the most recent campaign finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, meanwhile, has become best known for providing comic relief. He named 
a homeless priest as his North Hollywood coordinator, took to calling himself 
"Happy Jack" on campaign literature and even challenged Yaroslavsky to a dance 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Lake, a UCLA environmental sciences professor who made her reputation by 
challenging development projects approved by Yaroslavsky, is the favored 
candidate of activists from neighborhoods where development is especially 
troublesome, including the Westside Pavilion in Westwood and the Ma Maison 
Sofitel Hotel in West Los Angeles. She is also the leader of Not Yet New York 
and Friends of Westwood, which won a landmark case that requires the city to 
get environmental impact reports on most large development projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lake's Positions 
</P>
<P>
Lake contends that 5th District voters are fed up with Yaroslavsky's 
leadership. "People want a change and I'm there for them," she said. "Zev is 
not the person they used to know. There's no consistent history of caring." 
</P>
<P>
Lake supports stricter development controls. She has also called for a trash 
collection fee to pay for more police. She opposes the Metro Rail subway as too 
expensive but supports such other forms of transportation as light rail and 
shuttle buses. Lake frequently reminds voters that she, too, is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign finance reports show she has raised less than $100,000. But she has 
several other fund-raisers scheduled, as does Yaroslavsky, who had to return 
mayoral contributions and now hopes to get $200,000 for the council campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Door-to-Door Strategy 
</P>
<P>
As she canvassed for votes in West Los Angeles recently, a number of homeowners 
expressed disappointment in Yaroslavsky. But just as many were undecided. 
"We're neck and neck now," she said to one homeowner. "Every vote is critical." 
</P>
<P>
At another house, as a woman peered at her through a crack in the door, Lake 
said: "I really need your vote. Please? Pretty please?" 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Lash, a Beverlywood resident and Democratic Party activist who supports 
Lake, said life in her neighborhood, located near Robertson Boulevard and the 
Santa Monica Freeway, has drastically deteriorated under Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
Lash said her once-peaceful community is now overrun with traffic as motorists 
seek alternatives to the freeway. "We have trouble just backing out of our 
driveway to go to the grocery store," Lash said. "Our community has been so 
heavily impacted that it's like it's not a community anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for More Protection 
</P>
<P>
Diana Plotkin, who lives in the area near La Cienega and Beverly boulevards -- 
site of the Ma Maison Hotel and the Beverly Center developments -- said 
Yaroslavsky has deserted her neighborhood. "He has not afforded us the 
protections we're entitled to," Plotkin said. "He should be doing more." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, there are many who say Yaroslavsky has done the best 
job possible of protecting the community against unrelenting development 
pressures. Richard Agay, president of the Westside Community Planning Council 
and the Westwood Design Review Board, said some people have unrealistic 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"While Zev has not been universally successful in his efforts to hold down 
development, he has had a far greater percentage of success than any other 
candidate is likely to," Agay said. 
</P>
<P>
"To condemn him for not doing enough for the community is laughable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIFTH CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Fifth Council District has 128,328 voters, the most of all the 
city's 15 districts. More than 30% of its residents are 55 or older, and it is 
believed to have the city's largest Jewish voter population, estimated by the 
two leading candidates to be as high as 40%. The district takes in a big part 
of the Westside and a small portion of the San Fernando Valley. Its communities 
include Westwood, Bel-Air, Century City, the Fairfax District, parts of West 
Los Angeles and parts of Sherman Oaks, Studio City and North Hollywood. 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has represented the area since 1975.

TIBETANS IN SOUTHLAND KEEP FAITH; 
</P>
<P>
THEY VENERATE DALAI LAMA, LEAD AMERICAN LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thirty years ago, a divination dictated that 9-year-old Nawang Lhautara should 
leave Tibet. The Chinese were crushing a rebellion and rounding up Tibetans, so 
he embarked on a two-month trek to India. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 30 years later, Lhautara is a manager for Transamerica Life Co. and 
raising a family in Ontario. He still sends money to his stepmother and sisters 
in Tibet and opens his home to newly arrived countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 or so Tibetans scattered from San Diego to Santa Monica make up one of 
Southern California's smallest ethnic communities but also one of its 
pluckiest. 
</P>
<P>
Here, as professionals, monks, business people and students, they share a 
devotion to their homeland and to the Dalai Lama, their temporal and spiritual 
leader. "They lead American people's lives, they work, go on vacations," said 
Geshe Tsultim Gyeltsen, 60, a teacher at the Thubten Dhargye Ling ("Land of the 
Buddhist Teachings") Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remember Traditions 
</P>
<P>
But they also celebrate the Dalai Lama's birthday, Tibetan New Year and 
Buddha's birthday at the center and are excitedly preparing for the Dali Lama's 
visit to Los Angeles in July. They have a "Tibetan friendship" network to help 
those who are sick or alone in the United States. At occasional demonstrations, 
they protest the occupation of their homeland by the Chinese government, which 
Lhautara calls the "evil empire." 
</P>
<P>
They worry about family members back home, especially after this month's 
pro-independence demonstrations in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, that escalated into 
rioting, shootings by Chinese police and martial law. 
</P>
<P>
This month is already one of a somber anniversary: the unsuccessful 
anti-Chinese revolt on March 10, 1959, forced the Dalai Lama to flee for India 
on March 17. 
</P>
<P>
China's claims to Tibet date back to the 13th Century. Tibet was part of China 
under the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty, but held de facto independence after the 
dynasty's fall in 1911. In 1951, China took firm control of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Gyeltsen was a 30-year-old monk in 1959, studying at a monastic university on 
the outskirts of Lhasa. A few days after the March 10 revolt, he recalled, the 
university got word that Chinese soldiers were approaching. Gyeltsen grabbed a 
few prayer books and some tsampa (roasted barley flour) for the journey, and 
left with about 500 fellow monks. 
</P>
<P>
"Escape was very difficult, because the few good roads, the Chinese were 
holding already," he said. It took nearly a month to reach the Indian border, 
including at least three days of trudging through the snow-covered Himalayas. 
At one point, the monks left a southern Tibet town only a day ahead of Chinese 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Lhautara, then a student-trainee in the Tibetan government, recalls that on the 
day of the revolt, thousands of restive Tibetans surrounded the Dalai Lama's 
summer palace in response to rumors that the Chinese planned to kidnap their 
leader. For safety, Lhautara went to stay with his uncle, a monk at the Potala, 
the Dalai Lama's main residence. He recalled rushing to the basement when the 
Chinese started shelling the palace. 
</P>
<P>
A few nights later, Lhautara and his uncle went to their village, about 120 
miles east of Lhasa. The boy wanted to slip away to India. "I think it was a 
childhood fantasy kind of thing. I thought it was a neat idea to leave, and 
we'd be back soon, when things cooled down. . . . I'd join the guerrillas," 
Lhautara said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Couldn't Imagine Leaving' 
</P>
<P>
But his family -- his father and his two wives, two sisters and a brother -- 
had a dairy and about 2,000 acres of barley and millet and "couldn't imagine 
leaving all this and going to the unknown," Lhautara said. They turned to 
oracles for advice. 
</P>
<P>
At a nearby monastery, monks prayed, shook a bundle of sticks in a tumbler, and 
consulted the sticks that fell out and referred to certain scriptures. "It came 
out that I should go." 
</P>
<P>
Lhautara, his uncle, and about 60 monks hiked at night to avoid Chinese troops. 
"Non-Tibetans would have problems, surviving that elevation and terrain," 
Lhautara said. 
</P>
<P>
Once settled in India, Lhautara went to high school. He applied to colleges 
abroad and took the first offer, from Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
About 115,000 Tibetans now live in exile, the majority in India, according to 
Tinley Nyandak, who lives in New York and is the Dalai Lama's chief 
representative in North America. There are about 600 Tibetans scattered 
throughout the United States. Tibet has a population of 2 million, and there 
are about 4 million ethnic Tibetans elsewhere in China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make Return Visits 
</P>
<P>
Some Tibetan exiles, such as Lhautara, have made return visits to their 
homeland. "They were so poor it was ridiculous," he said, recalling seeing his 
family in 1981 for the first time in 22 years. Their land had been taken years 
earlier and "they lived in a shack about 20 by 8 feet with cows and everybody 
together in one room." During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, his sisters and 
his father's two wives had been beaten and ridiculed; his natural mother had 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Lhautara said that mid-level authorities in Tibet invited him to a banquet. 
"They were saying, 'You're very educated . . . why not come back and rebuild 
Tibet?' I said I would be glad to come back after the government of China and 
the Dalai Lama come to a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to kill Chinese because we are Buddhist. . . . But we ask 
please, don't stay here," Gyeltsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Tibet has been overlooked, Lhautara added, partly because "we don't have power, 
we don't have money, we don't have educated people or millions of people that 
can expend their lives." 
</P>
<P>
"People I meet in the corporate world shake my hand twice; they say, 'God, are 
you really from Tibet?' It's a sense of mysticism, romanticism. But other than 
that, what do we have? We have a just cause, but it doesn't seem it will win. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Obey Dalai Lama 
</P>
<P>
If the Dalai Lama called on him -- say, to help at a refugee community in India 
-- Lhautara would drop his "upper-middle-class Southern California life style," 
sell the house and the Volvo and BMW (whose license plates read "TIBET"), and 
go, "not because I'm a religious fanatic, but because of the type of person 
(the Dalai Lama) is. He would only ask me to do something that would be good in 
the eyes of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has taken his two young sons to see Tibetan refugee settlements 
in India and, earlier this month, to chant in a pro-independence demonstration 
at the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles. He helps the few newly arrived 
Tibetans find housing and apply for driver's licenses. And every month, he 
sends money to his family in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
"My family (in Tibet) benefited; my brother was able to come out," Lhautara 
said of the advantages of his leaving 30 years ago. "As a Buddhist, I would say 
it was my karma not to be left behind in Tibet."

GLASNOST IN SAN DIEGO;

<P>
31 SOVIET STUDENTS BASK IN GLOW OF HOSPITALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Soviet teen-agers praise an American president who once described the 
U.S.S.R. as an "evil empire" and a young San Diegan -- a bona fide capitalist 
-- trades Brezhnev jokes with an aspiring journalist from Moscow, you can be 
sure of one thing: 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War is losing its chill. 
</P>
<P>
The unflattering stereotypes and numerous misconceptions that brewed in both 
nations after World War II fostered distrust between Americans and Soviets for 
decades and accelerated fears of a nuclear holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
But such hostility has melted away in recent years as successful superpower 
summit meetings and reforms undertaken by Soviet leaders such as Mikhail 
Gorbachev have paved the way for open discussions between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
That warming trend has been clearly exhibited in San Diego, where students from 
La Jolla and San Diego High Schools are serving as hosts to 31 visiting Soviet 
students participating in a unique educational and cultural exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's Soviets' Turn to Sample U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, about 20 students from the two San Diego high schools visited 
Moscow. During their three-week trip to the Soviet Union, the students took 
part in educational camps and stayed with Soviet families. Now, it is the 
Soviets' turn to experience American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We fell in love with the Americans when they came to visit us," said Ivan 
Scheulov, 17. "We wanted to come back and see them again. We want to feel the 
American way of life. We want to know what they are eating, how they spend 
their leisure time." 
</P>
<P>
The young Soviet ambassadors -- many of them from high schools No. 23 and No. 
45 in Moscow -- were eager to learn about their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to promote an exchange of information, Soviet students initiated 
conversations with their American hosts and spoke frankly about superpower 
relations, noted differences in life styles and gave their opinions of 
political leaders as they were led on a whirlwind tour of downtown San Diego by 
the Central City Assn., the private downtown commerce group. 
</P>
<P>
"We have great respect for Ronald Reagan," said Andrey Sreshnikoff, 16. "It is 
because of his efforts that student exchanges like these are possible." 
</P>
<P>
Andrey and his friends praised Reagan primarily for his participation in 
superpower summit meetings. Similarly, they held their nation's leader in high 
regard. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev is the leader of the young people," Ivan said. "Everybody up to 50 
is a supporter of Gorbachev. The older people, the conservatives, are the ones 
who oppose his reforms." 
</P>
<P>
Andrey and Ivan, who are both planning to pursue careers in journalism, 
expressed their support for Gorbachev's approach to international relations -- 
glasnost, the policy of openness -- rather than the Cold War practice of 
spreading anti-American propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years, we listened to the wrong people," Andrey said. "The leaders of 
our country after World War II made us believe there was an American monster. 
But there is no such thing. We were fighting an enemy that did not exist." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Role of Women 
</P>
<P>
Errors of the past that soured U.S.-Soviet relations may well be avoided with 
the help of sound female leadership, according to 14-year-old Maryanne 
Nezhivaya, who hopes to enter the political arena one day. 
</P>
<P>
She said sexual discrimination is not an overt problem in the U.S.S.R. but 
added that there are Soviet men who believe a woman's place is at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Men reign supreme everywhere," Maryanne said sarcastically. "In the Soviet 
Union, some men think that a woman will get married and settle down. They feel 
women will not work as hard. But as long as you have a good brain and do well 
in school, you can do what you want." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Soviet students expected to receive a warm reception from their 
American hosts, they appeared overwhelmed by the hospitality shown by San 
Diegans. Practically everywhere the Soviet students visited, they were showered 
with souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Soviet Union, we are told that Americans are selfish . . . they care 
only about themselves," said 17-year-old Volodya Bernstein, who carried bags of 
San Diego trinkets. "But everybody here is so friendly. That is a stereotype. 
When I go home, I will explain to everybody that it is a lie." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange program has proved just as enlightening for the American students. 
Even a bona fide capitalist like Matt Starr, 18, a San Diego High senior who 
plans to pursue a career in real-estate development, returned from Moscow with 
a new impression of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to think that everybody in the Soviet Union is brainwashed by the 
government," he said. "That's not true at all. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I was over there, I didn't see major malcontent. They didn't want to 
leave their country. They are as proud of their country as we are of ours. I 
think that's the whole point of this program . . . to get a better 
understanding of each other, not to prove who is better."

<P>
Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier accepted a $10,000 reward for leaving her sickbed 
to vote for a bill. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Peter Chacon was paid $7,500 to sit still while a group that 
opposed a measure he was carrying "educated" him about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Wadie Deddeh collected $10,000 for 10 brief appearances before students at 
San Diego City College. 
</P>
<P>
The trio of San Diego lawmakers accepted the extra cash in the three years 
before California voters enacted Proposition 73, the political finance measure 
that now limits legislators' speaking fees or honorariums to $1,000 each year 
from each source. 
</P>
<P>
But examples like that of Mojonnier, Chacon and Deddeh have convinced some 
lawmakers and political reformers that the new limit is not strict enough. Many 
believe the time has come to ban all speaking fees, most of which come from 
sources that are seeking to influence the Legislature. Often, legislators are 
paid the money not for speeches but simply for meeting privately with a small 
group or attending a cocktail reception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'$1,000 Is a Lot of Money' 
</P>
<P>
"A thousand dollars is a lot of money to a lot of people," said John Larson, 
chairman of the Fair Political Practices Commission. "Our feeling is that it 
still leaves the impression of impropriety. If that's the case, why not just 
say no?" 
</P>
<P>
The 11 members of San Diego County's legislative delegation have not been among 
the state's leaders in receiving speaking fees. Combined, their total of 
$83,861 for 1987 and 1988 is less than half of what Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) earned by himself during the most recent two-year 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
But what the San Diego delegation lacks in quantity it has made up in flair, 
accepting money in a way that has attracted statewide attention each of the 
past three years. The examples: 
</P>
<P>
* In 1986, Deddeh, a Bonita Democrat, was paid $10,000 by the San Diego 
Community College District Foundation for 10 speaking engagements. He spoke to 
seven classes on American government, two groups of graduating students and a 
group of senior citizens attending a career day sponsored by the school. 
</P>
<P>
The payments outraged faculty leaders, who complained that Deddeh, as an 
elected official, should be willing to discuss American government with 
students without charging the college for his time. Deddeh defended his 
relationship with the college but has not spoken for money at the school since. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1987, Mojonnier, an Encinitas Republican, was given a $10,000 "legislator 
of the year" award by the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. Leaders 
of the prison guards group said they gave the money to Mojonnier, who had been 
ill, for leaving her sickbed to vote on a bill that placed a prison in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier insisted the money was fair payment for the speech she gave when she 
accepted the award at the association's annual convention. But the payment was 
far greater than any others Mojonnier has received in the six years she has 
been in the Legislature. Controversy over the exchange prompted the prison 
guards to abandon their plan to make the payment an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1988, Chacon, a San Diego Democrat, was paid $7,500 by the California 
Check Cashers Assn. to tour several check-cashing stores and meet with the 
group's board of directors. At the time, Chacon was carrying a bill to limit 
the fees the check cashers could charge. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon dropped the bill in committee on the same day that he received $4,000 
from the check cashers group. He received another $3,500 three months later. 
Chacon said the timing of the first payment was a "coincidence" and insists 
that the money did not influence his action. But he now says he favors a ban on 
honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Deddeh, Chacon and Mojonnier accounted for nearly half of the fees 
collected by the San Diego delegation in 1987 and 1988. Most members from the 
county take in only a small amount each year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Worth the Trouble' 
</P>
<P>
Former Sen. Jim Ellis (R-San Diego) had a policy of not accepting money for his 
speeches. Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) accepts very few such 
payments. But she does ask those who want to pay her for speaking to instead 
contribute to a favorite charity, usually the Child Abuse Prevention 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not worth the trouble," Killea said of the honorariums. "I'm in the 
fortunate position of not depending on that to pay my bills. Rather than 
getting all involved in getting that income, paying income tax on it, I'd 
rather go ahead and have them give the money to the charities I really want to 
give to. They get the full benefit of it and it isn't taxed. It's a way of 
tweaking Uncle Sam." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Killea may not have a choice. At least two bills have been introduced 
this year to ban honorariums. One of the bills was written by Assemblyman Ted 
Lempert, a freshman Democrat from San Mateo who won an upset election in 
November as a candidate who promised to clean up the Legislature. The other 
bill is by Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, who was a 
co-author of Proposition 73, the political finance measure that was approved by 
the voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to tighten down a lot further," Johnson said. "There have been 
some obvious examples where the amount of these so-called speaking fees 
certainly raises legitimate questions. I think we need to abandon them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Press 'Milked This Issue to Death' 
</P>
<P>
Chacon and Deddeh said they would support the move to ban the fees. Deddeh made 
it clear that he arrived at his position more from exasperation than anything 
else. He said he has grown weary of the annual newspaper stories about the 
groups from which he is accepting money. He said the press has "milked this 
issue to death" and vowed to support a ban on honorariums "to make life easier 
for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh brushed off questions about $1,500 he was paid in 1987 and $1,000 in 
1988 for speeches to the California Assn. of Collectors, a bill-collectors 
trade group. Deddeh has written legislation for the organization the past two 
years, including a measure he is writing now that would loosen state regulation 
of bill collectors and make it more difficult for the public to obtain the 
collectors' home addresses and phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh described the bill as "technical, corrective legislation" and pointed 
out that past measures he carried for the group passed the Legislature without 
a single dissenting vote. He said he carried the bills not because of the money 
he received but because he was requested to do so by the group's lobbyist, 
former Sen. Bob Wilson, who also lobbies for the community college district. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Wilson was a seatmate of mine for five years. He is a personal friend, he 
comes to me and says, 'Would you carry this?' " Deddeh said. "I said I would." 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh said he has never pressured anyone into giving him money for a speech or 
panel discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably, over my 23 years in the Legislature, I have given 3,000 to 4,000 
speeches, lectures, seminars, without any money in return for that," Deddeh 
said. "I wouldn't ask for that. I don't ask for that. But if I'm going to give 
a speech, and someone says here is $500 or $1,000, I'm not going to turn it 
down. I'm going to take it." 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, similarly, said inquiries about the money he receives are not worth the 
aggravation. He said the perception of conflict of interest in such exchanges 
"does not do anything to enhance the respectability" of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the commentaries written about our honorariums are right in at least 
one respect: The perception by the public is that there is a quid pro quo, even 
when there isn't," Chacon said. "There certainly wasn't in my case. But the 
perception is bad." 
</P>
<P>
Chacon said he believes the ban on honorariums should be linked to an increase 
in legislative salaries. Lawmakers now are paid $40,816 a year, plus $88 a day, 
tax-free, for living expenses while the Legislature is in session. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Doesn't Really Matter' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think California legislators are paid enough, especially when you 
consider that if this state were a country, it would have the fifth-largest 
economy in the world," Chacon said. But he said he would vote for a ban on 
speaking fees even if no pay raise were offered with it. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier, who collected no honorariums last year after being criticized for 
taking the $10,000 from the prison guards, said she does not care if the 
Legislature bans honorariums. She said her lack of speaking fees during 1988 
was happenstance, not the result of a conscious decision to avoid speaking for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't really matter to me one way or another," Mojonnier said. "I don't 
get a lot. So it doesn't matter. My position would have to depend on exactly 
what the bill said." 
</P>
<P>
One area lawmaker who opposes further regulation of legislators' outside income 
is Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego). Stirling, who collected nearly $12,000 in 
speaking fees during 1987 and 1988, said he favors a minimum of limits on 
political finances and a maximum of exposure through the required reporting of 
such transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"I say just report it, disclose it, and let the press and your opponents and 
the public make what they want of it," Stirling said. Endless tinkering with 
the political finance laws, he said, does not accomplish anything "except to 
further erode the public's confidence in the electoral process." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling suggested that elected officials rarely change their behavior because 
of a law or a gift or contribution from a special interest. 
</P>
<P>
"These things do not affect people's character," he said. "Your character is 
formed by the time you are 15 or 16 years old. It doesn't change when you get 
to the Legislature."

TRAPPING THE LIGHT FANTASTIC; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCHERS' LASER USES BORROW PAGES FROM SCIENCE FICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS V. HIGGINS, Higgins is a free-lance science writer who lives in 
Encino. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nineteen years ago, Arthur Ashkin performed a remarkable feat at Bell 
Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J. The physicist levitated a tiny glass sphere with 
a beam of laser light. 
</P>
<P>
The microscopic orb, no wider than a human hair, hovered motionless in space, 
helplessly ensnared by some magical force that seemingly defied both gravity 
and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the focused light from Ashkin's laser was almost a billion times 
more concentrated than sunlight and could slice through a sheet of metal, the 
beam passed harmlessly through the transparent glass bead, or microsphere. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkin's measurements revealed that the laser light was refracting, or bending, 
through the microsphere and subjecting it to a subtle combination of 
surprisingly strong forces. A microsphere placed in the laser beam is drawn to 
the focal point -- the narrowest part of the beam. Electromagnetic forces 
perpendicular to the direction of the beam also keep the microsphere centered. 
</P>
<P>
The result was startling. Like some force beam in a science fiction movie, the 
laser light trapped the microsphere within its focus. When the beam's focus 
moved, the microsphere helplessly followed. 
</P>
<P>
Today, years of development have transformed Ashkin's laser light trap into a 
new, powerful research tool with mind-boggling applications. 
</P>
<P>
Laser beams are being used to capture living microorganisms. And traps made 
from nothing but laser light can bring speeding atoms to a halt and imprison 
them for minutes at a time, allowing scientists to study them with a clarity 
never before possible. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the applications under investigation range from automated sorting of 
biological cells to the production of antimatter rocket fuel for interstellar 
space flight -- all made possible by the purity and intensity of laser light. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ashkin's research group at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories who discovered 
that laser light traps also worked on microscopic organisms. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting on their work in the journal Science, Ashkin and his colleague J. M. 
Dziedzic wrote: "We have used the laser light trap as 'optical tweezers' for 
moving live single and multiple bacteria while being viewed under a 
high-resolution optical microscope." 
</P>
<P>
The invention of "optical tweezers" could revolutionize microbiology by 
providing hands-off control on a microscopic scale. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor N. Buican, a researcher at the Life Sciences Division of Los Alamos 
National Laboratory in New Mexico, is perfecting optical tweezers into a 
computerized instrument he calls a "microscopic robot." Using a computer to 
control the positioning of laser beams, Buican can automatically sort and 
manipulate cells inside an airtight chamber while observing the whole process 
on a video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
For Buican, optical cell manipulators have distinct advantages over existing 
mechanical cell manipulators because they are non-invasive, more precise and 
can operate through the windows of a sealed container. These capabilities are 
vital in the study of infectious diseases such as AIDS, in which contamination 
is a serious concern. 
</P>
<P>
Optical tweezers could also be used to probe the inner workings of living cells 
in unique detail. David Clapham of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has 
proposed inserting chemically treated microspheres inside of cells and moving 
them around with optical tweezers in order to map the biochemistry of the cell. 
</P>

"The microsphere can be coated with a compound that senses calcium, for 
example," Clapham explained. "The fluorescence of the bead would change to 
reflect local calcium concentrations." Clapham believes the same technique 
could be used to chart other ion concentrations within the cell, which is 
important for understanding cell function. 
</P>
<P>
At the Beckman Laser Institute at UC Irvine, Michael Berns is already using 
laser light traps to study the biomechanics of cells. His investigations have 
recently uncovered surprisingly high spring tensions on the chromosomes within 
a cell. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do," Berns explained, "is grab the chromosomes with the optical trap, 
and that causes the cell to exert a very strong force to pull them out of the 
optical trap. When they get out of the trap, there's so much force pulling on 
them that they then recoil at an enormously high rate of speed." Berns hopes 
laser light traps will help unravel some of the mystery surrounding the 
physical mechanisms of cell division. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of laser light traps is their ability to 
cool the atoms of a gas to record low temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
To cool a gas, the average speed of its atoms must be reduced, and when the 
atoms are at rest, the temperature has reached absolute zero. 
</P>
<P>
Although absolute zero (0 Kelvin) is technically unattainable, William 
Phillips, Paul Lett and others at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., came within 43 millionths of a degree of it 
last summer by using the forces of laser light to slow and capture atoms of 
sodium. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists first slow down the atoms by bombarding them with photons of 
laser light traveling in the opposite direction, a process that Paul Lett 
likens to throwing Ping-Pong balls at onrushing bowling balls. Once the atoms 
have been slowed to a virtual stop, they are snagged in an "optical molasses" 
created by six opposing laser beams pointing east-west, north-south and 
up-down. For a few minutes this collection of atoms becomes the coldest spot on 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
Optical molasses amounts to a lot more than just an esoteric refrigerator, 
however. Physicists are interested in using the technique to test their 
theories of the atom by exploring the interaction between slow-moving atoms. 
Spectroscopists can also measure the light emission and absorption of 
ultra-cold atoms with unprecedented precision. 
</P>
<P>
Optical molasses could improve the accuracy of atomic clocks by 10,000 times. 
And there are even schemes to use laser light traps for the manufacture and 
storage of solid antimatter. 
</P>
<P>
Antimatter, as any Trekie will explain, is the "flip side" of ordinary matter, 
and when the two opposites unite, they obliterate each other with an intense 
burst of pure energy. 
</P>
<P>
Laser light traps might one day make it possible to contain antimatter and 
harness its enormous potential energy. If so, the stars would literally be 
within our grasp.

CAPTURING ATOMS: FIRST YOU HAVE TO SLOW THEM DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS V. HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slowing and capturing atoms by bombarding them with photons of laser light is 
easier said than done. One elegant solution to the problem took scientists 
years to devise, and both the problem and the solution concern a phenomenon 
called the Doppler effect. 
</P>
<P>
In everyday life, the Doppler effect can be heard when a car passes by blowing 
its horn. The pitch, or frequency, of the horn slides noticeably downward as 
the car goes by because the horn's sound waves are distorted by the car's 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
As the car approaches, the sound waves are squeezed closer together like the 
bow waves of a boat, so the horn's pitch sounds higher than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
Motion also distorts the frequency, or color, of light waves and photons. 
Therefore, to a sodium atom hurtling head-on through a barrage of yellow laser 
photons, the color of each photon appears slightly shifted toward the 
higher-frequency blue part of the spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
This Doppler shift complicates atom trapping because free atoms absorb photons 
only at select frequencies called resonant frequencies. Like tiny radios 
programmed for several key stations, the atoms absorb laser photons only when 
the laser is "broadcasting" at one or more of those predetermined frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
Since the motion of the atoms shifts the laser's apparent frequency out of tune 
with their resonant frequencies, scientists must compensate for the difference. 
</P>
<P>
One solution is to apply a strong magnetic field to the atoms. This alters 
their structure and fine-tunes the atomic "radios" until the laser "station" 
locks in. 
</P>
<P>
But that creates another problem. When the atoms are tuned in, they absorb 
laser photons and quickly decelerate. And as the atoms continue to slow down, 
the apparent frequency of the oncoming photons shifts out of tune again. Photon 
absorption falls off and so does deceleration. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, this problem is solved by tapering the magnet that surrounds the 
atoms. As the atoms absorb photons and decelerate down the barrel of the 
magnet, the steadily changing magnetic field keeps their resonant frequency 
correctly tuned to the laser frequency. 
</P>
<P>
Once the atoms have absorbed enough photons to bring them to a virtual stop 
(about 30,000 for a sodium atom), they can be confined by a force field called 
"optical molasses," which is created by six opposing laser beams pointing 
east-west, north-south and up-down. 
</P>
<P>
Since the six identical beams are deliberately detuned just below the resonant 
frequency, atoms traveling in any direction with enough velocity to escape will 
encounter Doppler-shifted photons near or at their resonant frequency. The 
resulting increase in photon absorption slows down the atoms and usually 
frustrates their escape. A difficult problem becomes a clever solution. THOMAS 
V. HIGGINS

IN BRIEF: VIRUS, HODGKIN'S LINK SEEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers report new evidence linking a common virus to Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Mueller and her colleagues at the Harvard University School of Public 
Health found people whose blood contained active Epstein-Barr virus or EBV 
appeared much more likely to go on to develop Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Previous studies had found people who had had mononucleosis, which is caused by 
EBV, were at increased risk for Hodgkin's disease, a relatively unusual cancer 
of the lymph nodes. Studies also found Hodgkin's patients tended to have high 
levels of antibodies to EBV. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers were uncertain whether these findings indicated that the virus 
played a role in causing the disease or whether the virus simply became active 
after patients developed the disease. 
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers 
examined blood drawn from 43 people an average of about four years before their 
conditions were diagnosed as Hodgkin's and blood drawn from another 96 people 
about the same time who never developed the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Those who had high levels of antibodies to EBV when their blood was drawn were 
about three to four times as likely to go on to develop Hodgkin's disease, the 
researchers found.

IN BRIEF: LONGER AIDS INCUBATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Half of the homosexual men who become infected with the AIDS virus may remain 
free of the disease for nearly 10 years, about two years longer than recently 
reported estimates suggest, a study says. 
</P>
<P>
The median incubation time of 9.8 years is "the best estimate so far," but 
medical treatments might make it longer, researcher Andrew Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
He and colleague Peter Bacchetti of the UC San Francisco and San Francisco 
General Hospital presented the finding in the British journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers analyzed three studies that indicated trends in infection rates 
among San Francisco gay men since 1978 and compared them to monthly totals of 
new cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The work concurs with other studies that have suggested that the number of new 
AIDS cases among San Francisco gay men will decline after this year, Moss said.

EASTERN AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a baggage handler making $6.50 an hour for a non-union carrier, I find it 
abhorrent that Eastern's bag handlers are screaming the blues about having to 
take a pay cut from $15.60 to $11.54 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the benefits that come with my airline -- including free or 
reduced-fare travel passes -- many workers such as myself are satisfied with 
what we earn. 
</P>
<P>
The only mistake Eastern made was letting these workers get so comfortable with 
their overpaid wages. Although airline mechanics are considered skilled, one 
has to question whether scheduled minor airline maintenance is worth close to 
$20 an hour, especially when most of the time is spent sitting around waiting 
for the planes. 
</P>
<P>
The $14 or $16 for the mechanics and $11.54 for the bag handlers is going to 
look mighty fine once they find themselves out of work. 
</P>
<P>
I've seen it all too many times before: They have only themselves to blame.

EVERY DROP MATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians may be tempted to indulge in a bit of smugness when they 
read about the water sacrifices that Northern Californians will have to make 
this year -- cutbacks of nearly 50% to some San Francisco Bay area homes -- 
unless there is a dramatic easing of drought conditions. But any thoughts of 
superiority should be fleeting, because Southern California is just one big 
bucket away from severe water shortages. That bucket is the Colorado River, 
from which the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will draw 1.2 
million acre-feet of water this year. One acre-foot is enough to supply the 
needs of two residential families for a year. 
</P>
<P>
There are two reasons why Colorado River water will provide the buffer between 
just-adequate supplies and real hardship: There is a surplus in the river's 
massive reservoirs because of recent wet years in the Colorado's watershed and 
because the state of Arizona is not yet taking its full allocation of Colorado 
water. That will end in about 1992, when the Central Arizona Project's Tucson 
aqueduct is completed. When Tucson taps in, Met's share of the Colorado drops 
by more than half, to 550,000 acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the Colorado buffer, Southern Californians must get serious about 
saving water, and soon. Conservation must become a way of life in the region, 
says Carl Boronkay, the general manager of Metropolitan, the wholesaler of 
water to districts serving about 14 million people throughout the Southland. 
"Southern California is facing growing water needs and dwindling supplies," 
Boronkay said in announcing a $2-million conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987-89 drought has helped fuel a new debate over the fact that arid 
Southern Californiagets much of its supply from Northern California via the 
State Water Project -- specifically, from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta near 
Sacramento. But the old North-South water argument is taking different twists 
this year as San Francisco Bay Area residents begin to understand the 
inadequacies of their own water systems. A recent editorial in the Palo Alto 
Peninsula Times-Herald said: "The area's reservoir system is inadequate to 
supply the present population, much less the people expected to be here five or 
10 years from now." In the San Jose Mercury News, columnist Phil Yost wrote: 
"It's time to stop being smug. For the Bay Area, the drought is emphasizing 
what was always true: Much of the water we use isn't our water, either." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, San Francisco and Oakland went into the western Sierra Nevada early 
this century to get their water supplies just about the time Los Angeles went 
to the eastern Sierra to get its. It also is true that much of the Bay Area now 
draws on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for considerable supplies, just as 
Southern California does. 
</P>
<P>
The drought mood of 1989 does not mean Southern California will be able to 
convince the North to give up more water. The Delta must be protected. The 
North needs to augment its own supplies. It may mean, however, that both parts 
of the state realize the importance of working together to develop additional 
reservoir storage capacity soon so that more wet-year moisture can be banked 
for use by all during times of shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California also needs to get serious about water conservation 
immediately. Another dry year and that Colorado buffer bucket could begin to 
look pretty small.

TEACHING KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
March 6 front-page article by Roxanne Arnold, "Research, Not Ratings, Sets the 
Tone," describes how young children learn geography from "Sesame Street," that 
the creators are doing research on how to teach kids about relationships and 
that many 3 to 5 year olds who watch the show know their numbers and alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
My question is: Why are we replacing real life experience with television 
viewing in the teaching of preschool-age children? Why not take our children to 
the mountains or desert to teach them about geography (or, more importantly, 
just for the fun of it)? Why not provide good role models for our kids if we 
want them to learn about relationships? And what twisted sense has us teaching 
kids their letters on TV? 
</P>
<P>
As a parent I find that young children need to be out experiencing the world as 
much as possible and in as many ways as we can think of. They need to see the 
world, touch it and smell it to understand it. In my opinion, "educational 
television" may be all right when one's alternative is a more deprived 
experience of the world. But parents, when we can, let's turn off "Sesame 
Street" and take our kids out to explore our neighborhoods instead!

In response to your article regarding how pilots hope to slow air travel, Part 
I, March 7: 
</P>
<P>
What is the difference between a hijacker who takes the public captive and 
Henry A. Duffy and his ALPA who propose taking the air travelers captive? 
</P>
<P>
As one who still suffers from the effects of sitting in an airplane on the 
Tarmac in Chicago without air conditioning for several hours during the air 
controllers' slowdown of the late '70s, I fail to understand the rationale of a 
group who claims to be interested in the safety and welfare of the public. I 
believe the answer lies in one word -- greed -- or "Look out for ourselves and 
the public be damned." 
</P>
<P>
The effect on passengers is the same whether they are hijacked by a terrorist 
or by the Airline Pilots Assn.!

A MORBID FEAR OF ILLNESS MAKES AMERICA TRASH GOOD FOOD AND COMMON SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH M. WHELAN, Dr. Elizabeth M. Whelan is executive director of the 
American Council on Science and Health, a nonprofit consumer education 
organization based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What this country needs right now is a national psychiatrist to determine why 
Americans are discarding wholesome food in a mindless effort to reduce the risk 
of cancer. It's a good bet that the professional 50-state diagnosis would be 
acute nosophobia. 
</P>
<P>
Nosophobia is defined as a morbid dread of illness. It is a form of psychosis 
that is extremely hazardous to both physical and mental health; its effects on 
our nation's children are particularly insidious. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent and to date most virulent episode of national nosophobia was 
triggered by the release last month of a report by the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, which opined that trace levels of agricultural chemicals cause 
cancer in kids. The sole basis for this phenomenal and frightening charge was 
the assumption that huge levels of chemical pesticides that cause cancer in 
mice must also be carcinogens in humans, even at the barely measurable levels 
which might be found in produce. 
</P>
<P>
The report had the ideal volatile mix for drawing public attention. Food is a 
highly emotional topic, and rumors about food safety have always spread rapidly 
and irrationally. 
</P>
<P>
When you add in our universal concern about the safety of children, you have an 
instant winner for a media blitz. "60 Minutes" gave us a member of Congress who 
linked consumption of fruits and vegetables with the tragic appearance of 
children in a cancer ward. Phil Donahue gave us Meryl Streep with suggestions 
on how to use vinegar or detergent to get the carcinogens out. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-March, one could almost palpate the national nosophobia, perhaps best 
illustrated by the wire service report of a New York mother who, hearing on the 
news one morning last week that apples cause cancer, called the state police to 
intercept her child's school bus to remove the allegedly offensive fruit from 
the lunch box. Even President Bush proclaimed that he drinks carrot juice 
because carrots aren't sprayed with that nasty stuff. 
</P>
<P>
What have we got here? We have a national tragedy of spectacular proportions, 
one that is ultimately a real threat to the health of Americans, particularly 
children. While there has never been a single case of ill health, in children 
or adults, related to the regulated use of approved pesticides in the United 
States (and no toxicologist worth his sodium chloride thinks that a mouse is a 
little man) there are some real health hazards directly attributable to the 
national nosophobia about apples and other produce. 
</P>
<P>
Item: I was approached last week by a 10-year-old who asked me if she would 
develop cancer from all that apple juice she drank as a baby from a bottle. 
"When will I get the cancer?" she asked anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
Item: My daughter stood by as her school discarded hundreds of pieces of apple 
pie because they "caused cancer." 
</P>
<P>
What are we doing to our children? What are they to think when we ban or 
discard food that, for all their lives, was described to them as wholesome, 
safe and health-promoting? 
</P>
<P>
Item: Last weekend a neighbor of mine told me of her sheer hysteria about 
cancer-causing apples. She was throwing out sauce, juice, the works, because no 
risk was acceptable for her child (this "no acceptable risk" is the centerpiece 
of the Meryl Streep campaign, Mothers and Others for Pesticide Limits). The 
next morning I saw this same woman riding with her infant on the back of her 
bike on a sandy road -- with no helmet on the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Toxic terrorism, of the ilk of the Natural Resources Defense Council report, 
causes nosophobia. Nosophobia causes unnecessary anxiety and blurred vision, 
which negates our ability and our children's ability to distinguish between 
real and hypothetical risks. And that puts the public health of this nation in 
serious jeopardy.

PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES TO JAIL'S FAST SHUFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY J. NIDORF, Barry J. Nidorf is chief probation officer of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The local manifestation of the nationwide epidemic of overcrowded jails, 
prisons and juvenile facilities became evident recently when Los Angeles County 
Sheriff Sherman Block was forced, under federal court order, to increase the 
number of early releases of county prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
News of the announcement was accompanied by a disturbing photograph. It showed 
a just-released inmate, a smile on his face, who had served his 14-day county 
jail sentence in 14 hours -- or at the rate of 2 1/2 minutes on the hour. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with jail sentences shortened because of overcrowding, law-abiding 
citizens must wonder what kind of justice we have anymore. They must sense that 
overcrowding is undermining the only weapon the courts can use to protect the 
community -- the threat of criminal sanction. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal sanction is the "cost" that society attaches to crime to make it 
unrewarding to criminals. When the cost of a crime has to be reduced so much 
that a 14-day jail sentence can be served in 14 hours, what message is sent? 
The obvious message to criminals is that their crimes won't cost them much at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
With no end in sight to the serious jail overcrowding problem, it is time that 
the community look to new criminal sanctions that can protect its citizens and 
satisfy the demands of justice without depending on scarce jail beds. Jail may 
be where most citizens want criminals to be, but that is not reality today. 
There is just not enough space to hold any but the most dangerous and violent 
criminals. New sanctions, strong enough to deter, are needed for criminals who 
are released early -- or do not go to jail at all -- because of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
But if new sanctions are not found and used, a never-ending cycle of greater 
overcrowding and earlier release will embolden confirmed criminals to continue 
committing crimes, while failing to discourage would-be criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Which new sanctions are needed? Examples include "house arrest," electronic 
monitoring of criminals confined to their homes on probation; "work 
sentencing," using supervised crews of probationers sentenced to work improving 
community buildings, parks, roads and other public areas, or "work furlough," a 
program in which employed probationers work their regular jobs by day and are 
sentenced to stay in a contracted residential center by night. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctions like these are obviously not appropriate for every criminal. Violent 
offenders and habitual criminals belong in jail or prison. But for petty 
criminals and even many non-violent felons, such sanctions are not only 
appropriate but needed. They help to mitigate the jail overcrowding crisis by 
imposing penalties right in the community. They attach a cost to crime that is 
more demanding than just sitting in jail for a few hours. Coupled with a 
beefed-up, quick-to-respond surveillance capability, these community-based 
sanctions are effective, tough and affordable. 
</P>
<P>
For the past five years the Los Angeles County Probation Department, with money 
and personnel provided by the Board of Supervisors, has been developing and 
testing such sanctions. The probation department has been working more closely 
than ever with police and prosecutors to develop stronger, more responsive 
surveillance. The department has created a joint surveillance capability with 
the police so that now, in selected areas of the county, patrol officers as 
well as probation officers enforce court orders on probationers. With the 
district attorney, the department acts to move violent and dangerous criminals 
out of the community and into state prison immediately if they violate the law 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Necessary as new sanctions and police-probation-legal partnerships are, they 
are not easy to create and operate when money and staff are greatly limited. 
The probation department has had to shift resources and staff to create special 
sanction programs, but they are worth it. They not only provide clear and 
immediate penalties, they do so at a cost far less than that of incarceration 
-- and with deterrent results and victim benefits greater than jail can 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that policy-makers will fund alternatives to incarceration as 
long as they believe that their constituents accept confinement as the only 
appropriate sanction for crime. In fact, any alternative is all too easy to 
reject because dollars spent for these programs are like an investment. The 
return (reduction of crime rate) is not achieved during the current budget 
year. On the other hand, jails and prisons, though far more expensive, are easy 
to point to as evidence of a strong committment to solving the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
Recent RAND Corp. research has demonstrated that local corrections can be more 
effective than prison in reducing recidivism. The research is there, the 
expertise of the local corrections staff is there, but the political will to 
fund these community sanctions is not there. 
</P>
<P>
Effective sanction programs, "prisons without walls," must have community 
support. Faced with the jail overcrowding crisis, the community needs to decide 
how to best protect itself from crime. Do we want to continue to base 
expectations for criminal sanctions on jails that are no longer available 
except for the most dangerous criminals? Or should we begin to base 
expectations for criminal correction programs on corrections that are readily 
available and that can effectively improve protection for the community? 
</P>
<P>
By deciding to develop community-based sanctions, we can reserve jail for those 
who really need it and still attach a real cost to crime.

A 'VIVA SUPER BARRIO' IN L.A. IS NOT EXACTLY THE MESSAGE OFFICIAL MEXICO LIKES 
TO HEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK del OLMO, Frank del Olmo is a Times editorial writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On first glance, the Mexican character known as Super Barrio does not seem the 
kind of figure who could cause an international incident. For that matter, even 
after a second or third look, its hard to take Super Barrio very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
With his red mask and leotards, gold bikini shorts and flowing yellow cape, 
most people in this country would probably react to Super Barrio as I did the 
first time I saw him -- with laughter. But there are people in Mexico who take 
Super Barrio, and what he represents, quite seriously. That's why some Mexican 
government officials are upset by the favorable attention Super Barrio got when 
he visited California a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Professional wrestling is a popular pastime for Mexico's urban poor. Super 
Barrio, in fact, is modeled on El Santo, the Saint, the masked-marvel hero of a 
series of old wrestling movies that still show up occasionally on 
Spanish-language television. 
</P>
<P>
But Super Barrio is not really a professional wrestler. He is the symbol of the 
Assembly of Barrios, a grass-roots movement of Mexico City slum dwellers that 
emerged in the aftermath of the 1985 earthquake that did so much damage to poor 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Super Barrio has helped lead protests against tenant evictions in Mexico City, 
a nuclear power plant in Veracruz and Mexican government corruption. He became 
internationally famous last summer when he lent his support to Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, the leading anti-government candidate in Mexico's closely fought 
presidential election. He often campaigned alongside Cardenas -- the same way a 
minor movie star named Chuck Norris, who makes low-budget martial-arts movies 
not all that different from the Mexican films featuring El Santo, campaigned 
alongside President Bush in last year's U.S. election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Super Barrio is a symbol of political dissent in Mexico. That's why the New 
York Times did a front page article on him. And on his recent trip to 
California, arranged by opponents of the Mexican government, Super Barrio was 
accompanied by a photographer from People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of attention drives Mexican government officials to distraction. Not 
only does Super Barrio question the legitimacy of the Mexican political system 
by criticizing it, he does so using symbols popular with Mexico's underclass. 
That has to bother the middle- and upper-class Mexicans who represent their 
nation in the world's capitals and financial centers like New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For example, officials in the Mexican consulate here are very unhappy because 
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who represents the heavily Latino 
Eastside, got the council to approve a commendation for Super Barrio when he 
visited City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Now, City Council members hand out honorary scrolls and commendations like 
penny candy. A while back Alatorre even got the council to pass a resolution 
honoring "Spuds" Mackenzie, the dog that stars in those TV beer commercials, on 
the occasion of his visit to Los Angeles. But try explaining that to the angry 
Mexican diplomats who are convinced the city took a slap at the government of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari by honoring Super Barrio. 
</P>
<P>
Given the many complex and difficult problems between the United States and 
Mexico, from foreign debt to drug trafficking, a diplomatic flap over a campy 
wrestler hardly seems worth focusing on. Except that Super Barrio's visit to 
Los Angeles is yet another illustration of how easily Mexico and the United 
States misunderstand each other, even when the U.S. citizens involved are 
Mexican-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that Alatorre or his council aides even thought about Mexican 
government reaction when they decided to draft the resolution for Super Barrio. 
All they know is that there are people in Alatorre's district who like what 
Super Barrio stands for. 
</P>
<P>
And the Mexican government seems to have forgotten that there are thousands of 
Chicanos all over this country who feel the same. Most Mexican-Americans don't 
understand the complexities of Mexican politics, or the sensitivity of Mexican 
officialdom to diplomatic slights involving the United States. And they could 
not care less. 
</P>
<P>
The affection Chicanos feel for Mexico is based on its culture (both elite and 
popular), not its politics. If they think about the Mexican political system at 
all, most Chicanos share the cynical view of other U.S. citizens that it is 
corrupt and not very democratic. And if they can show some affection for their 
ancestral homeland by honoring a symbol of protest against that system -- even 
a portly guy in a mask and red tights -- they'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
So, Viva Super Barrio!

PUT A BRAKE ON HIGH-TECH ALLIANCES; 
</P>
<P>
INTERNATIONAL TIES HELP FIRMS, BUT NOT ALWAYS THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT B. REICH, Robert B. Reich teaches political economy and management at 
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's much talk in Washington these days about America's technological 
slippage. The costs and risks of staying in the high-tech race are rising so 
fast that many American firms can't do it alone. 
</P>
<P>
The new answer: Pool your research and development funds with other American 
companies, add government subsidies and resources from national laboratories, 
and ally yourselves with American universities. Then the nation's technological 
lead will be regained and your profits restored. 
</P>
<P>
For years Japan has been convening such research-and-development partnerships, 
sweetened by government funding. Western Europeans -- with 1992 on their minds 
-- are doing much the same, sponsoring hundreds of 
industry-government-university consortia aimed at technologies of the future. 
Now even Washington is getting into the act, the free-market incantations of 
the Reagan and Bush Administrations notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Support is building for government-sponsored consortia in superconductive 
materials and high-definition television. Meanwhile, the Pentagon has sunk its 
first $100 million into Sematech, an alliance of American semiconductor makers 
aiming to close the gap with the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
More generally, the Defense Science Board now urges the creation of an 
"industrial policy committee," under the President's national-security adviser, 
to spur joint high-tech research projects among American corporations. And 
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh suggest 
further relaxing the nation's antitrust laws to make it easier for American 
firms to join together for research, development and commercialization in order 
to compete better with foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Where will all this lead? One scenario has governments, businesses and 
universities teaming up within each of the world's three great technological 
power blocs -- Japan, America and the European Community -- in a contest for 
21st-Century technological preeminence. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. National alliances may be the rage in Washington, but American 
high-tech corporations are playing a different game. They seek financial or 
technical help from whomever will supply it on the best terms, anywhere around 
the globe. Even as they partake of government subsidies and antitrust 
immunities at home, most American high-tech firms are simultaneously teaming up 
with Japanese and European firms abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments, America's leading producer of semiconductors, has joined 
with Hitachi to design and produce a superchip that will store 16 million bits 
of data. Meanwhile, Motorola, America's second-largest producer, has paired 
with Toshiba to research and produce a new generation of computer chips. And 
Sun Microsystems, the darling of Silicon Valley, has just teamed up with 
Fujitsu to produce a new generation of workstations. In these deals and others, 
American firms will be sharing their latest technology with their Japanese 
partners and vice versa. And much of the research and production will occur 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's hard to find a large American high-tech company that is not in 
some sort of partnership with a foreign firm. And American companies are doing 
research and development all over the world. National boundaries are irrelevant 
to these global strategies. America's high-tech research, development and 
production now span the globe. 
</P>
<P>
America is being cuckolded. Why give subsidies and antitrust immunities to 
American high-tech firms if what's discovered within a national consortium is 
easily transferred to the company's global partners, or its overseas 
researchers? The nation's technological gap with Japan will never close if, for 
example, Texas Instruments takes the insights it gains from its membership in 
Sematech and applies them to its Japanese venture with Hitachi. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese and European high-tech consortia operate by different ground rules. 
Their strategies are global, but their interests are indisputably national. 
Their members occasionally work with American companies -- even do research 
here -- but primarily for the purpose of transferring technical know-how back 
home. The overarching goal of these efforts is to give their nations' 
researchers and engineers a deeper understanding of the new technologies, not 
simply to preserve the profitability of their high-tech firms. When the 
Japanese wanted to learn about how to make jet airplanes, for example, Japanese 
firms allied themselves with Boeing, which agreed to teach them in return for a 
fat fee. 
</P>
<P>
America should follow the same tacit strategy -- limiting membership in 
government-sponsored consortia to firms committed to developing the 
technological competence of the American work force, rather than merely 
improving their own balance sheets. Global alliances would not be barred, but 
terms should be subject to negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
A national strategy for high technology requires that distinctions be drawn 
between the interests of American companies and those of the nation. To master 
the technologies of the future, it's not enough that American firms be 
competitive. Americans themselves must gain the mastery.

NEIGHBORS FORGE PLAN TO FIGHT STARLIGHT'S FOCUS ON BIG CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank residents who live near the Starlight Amphitheatre met Sunday to plan 
opposition to the City Council's efforts to turn the outdoor theater into a 
forum for large concerts featuring well-known musical groups. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, who gathered in Stough Park, said they will fight the council's 
recent decision to allow a Santa Monica-based concert promotion and booking 
firm to try to turn the troubled amphitheater into a major commercial venue. 
Instead, they said, the forum should be used for community and civic events. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the city so hard up for money that it has to turn this into a commercial 
venture?" asked Lyn Vogt, who lives near the amphitheater. "It is sheer greed. 
The council thinks the city has to be into money-making facilities. I don't 
know where the council got this idea, but we don't need this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Streets 
</P>
<P>
The amphitheater is in the Verdugo Mountains in northeast Burbank and can only 
be reached by driving through residential neighborhoods. The neighbors said 
regular popular music concerts in the amphitheater would cause traffic, noise 
and parking problems and bring vandalism, litter, drugs and violence to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
These fears, they said, are based on their experiences after several concerts 
staged at the Starlight last year. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Hooper, who lives on one of the four residential streets that reach the 
Starlight, said that after one reggae concert he found "eggs on our house, 
broken bottles on the lawn and people yelling and screaming way after 
midnight." Others complained about heavy traffic after the concerts and 
confrontations with drunk concert-goers. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, the Starlight has been managed by Tim Pinch, who was 
directed to turn the facility into a profitable one by attracting famous 
entertainers. Pinch, however, was fired in January, after a season in which he 
presented only five shows in the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the City Council tentatively authorized the negotiation of an 
agreement with World Entertainment Services that would allow the agency to 
schedule concerts for the amphitheater 355 nights a year. The firm also is 
seeking a liquor license that would allow it to sell alcohol during the events. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, however, say they have had enough and plan to pack a City Council 
meeting Tuesday night. They said they will ask the council not to sign the 
proposed agreement with World Entertainment Services. They added that they have 
collected more than 400 signatures on a petition asking that the city drop its 
efforts to turn the amphitheater into a major commercial enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Walsh, an opposition organizer who lives on the main street leading to the 
amphitheater, said neighbors should have gotten involved earlier to prevent 
city officials from developing the plan this far. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we didn't think they would possibly try to expand the concerts here 
after all the trouble we had," he said. "We are late, but we are acting." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh pointed out that there are already many venues for major musical groups 
in the Los Angeles area, including the nearby Universal Amphitheatre. The 
Starlight should be kept to showcase entertainment from the local community, he 
said.

VENTURA FREEWAY REPAIRS PUT DRIVERS IN A FIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring vacationers, beach-goers and other motorists crawled along the Ventura 
Freeway in Woodland Hills this weekend, at one point spending two hours to 
drive 10 miles because of lanes closed for freeway repairs, officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
From Saturday night through Sunday afternoon, Caltrans shut down all but one 
lane of the freeway in both directions for about quarter of a mile between 
Fallbrook Avenue and Topanga Canyon Boulevard. Two eastbound lanes were closed 
and one was left open in the same area Friday night and Saturday morning, state 
Department of Transportation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were pouring concrete on freeway overpasses at Topanga Canyon, Ventura 
Boulevard and Shoup Avenue, said Larry Hathaway, Caltrans traffic coordinator 
for the freeway-widening plan. The 16-month, $23-million project between White 
Oak Avenue and Topanga Canyon Boulevard began early last year. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the weekend snarl was the closure of several on- and off-ramps, 
including those at Topanga Canyon and Ventura boulevards and Shoup Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stop and Go 
</P>
<P>
It took nearly two hours to travel about 10 miles late Sunday morning, 
California Highway Patrol Officer Monty Keifer said. He said eastbound drivers 
were running into stop-and-go traffic before Parkway Calabasas. But, Keifer 
said, many drivers insisted on staying on the freeway until they reached 
Fallbrook Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The backup for westbound motorists Sunday started near the San Diego Freeway, 
CHP Officer Andy Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think these people are vacationers -- due to spring break -- who are 
unfamiliar with the project and are just sticking it out," Keifer said. "They 
have suitcases in their cars." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans and the CHP were advising motorists to use the Simi Valley Freeway, 
Pacific Coast Highway and Ventura Boulevard as alternates to the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to ease problems, Caltrans posted service trucks on the freeway 
and traffic officers on surface streets, Hathaway said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overheating Common 
</P>
<P>
"We gave service to a lot of people both days," Hathaway said. "Anytime people 
have to wait in traffic, some cars overheat because people don't shut off their 
air conditioners." 
</P>
<P>
People living near the Ventura Freeway said their neighborhood streets were 
busier that usual with drivers seeking relief from the freeway jams. 
</P>
<P>
Laureen Komma, 27, of Woodland Hills said that on Sunday around noon, it took 
20 minutes to drive from her home on Del Valle Street near Fallbrook Avenue to 
church at Ventura Boulevard and De Soto Avenue. Usually it's a 10-minute trip, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Boulevard was "all backed up," Komma said. "We tried to take alternate 
routes around it. . . . There were traffic officers, but tons of cars, so 
there's not much they can do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surface Streets 
</P>
<P>
Larry Frey, a security guard at an automobile dealership on Calabasas Road, 
said he has been taking city streets rather than the freeway to work from his 
Woodland Hills home. Before, he said, he would get on the freeway at Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard and get off at Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a joke," he said of the construction project. "Why are they adding a lane 
onto the freeway when there's all this talk about air quality?" He suggested 
that some sort of light rail transit system or monorail be built instead. 
</P>
<P>
Repairs of the overpasses at Topanga Canyon Boulevard, Shoup Avenue and Ventura 
Boulevard are not finished and will probably continue next Friday and Saturday 
nights, Hathaway said. Work will not be done on Easter Sunday, he said.

DRIVER DIES, PASSENGER HURT IN CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A38-year-old Simi Valley man was killed and a passenger was critically injured 
when the car they were riding in left the roadway and catapulted down a steep 
hill, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley police Lt. Richard Thomas said the two men were drinking at a Simi 
Valley bar Saturday night when an argument erupted between the driver of the 
car and his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Robert Trug, left the bar with a friend, 36-year-old Richard 
Christian of Palmdale, in the car owned by Trug's girlfriend, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred shortly afterward, at about 11:40 p.m., on First Street 
near Bennett Street. 
</P>
<P>
The car rolled over a number of times before coming to rest on its wheels, 
Thomas said. Trug was found in the driver's seat and was declared dead at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Christian was found about 75 feet farther down the embankment. He was taken to 
Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, where he was in critical condition with severe 
head injuries, Thomas said.

1,700 IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY LOSE POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 1,700 Santa Clarita Valley residents were without electricity Saturday 
night after an underground cable failed, a Southern California Edison spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The power outage at 7:45 p.m. hit homes around Tournament Road and Player Drive 
near the Vista Valencia Golf Course in Valencia, said Rosalie Gnam, Santa 
Clarita Valley manager for Edison. The cable, estimated to be 15 years old, 
"just gave way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Within two hours, power had been restored to about three-fourths of the 
residents. The rest had electricity by 1 a.m., Gnam said. 
</P>
<P>
Crews worked throughout the night to repair the cable, she said.

GIPSY KINGS: ACCENT ON FLAMENCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the left-field pop phee-noms around these days -- and there are plenty 
-- none is more inexplicable than the Gipsy Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Not undeserving. Just inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
By the screams and squeals of the 3,000 or so people who packed the Hollywood 
Palladium for the group's appearance on Friday, you might have thought George 
Michael (with whom the Kings worked in a Diet Coke TV commercial) was expected 
to perform, not a band of real French/Spanish gypsies that plays what can best 
be described as flamenco-pop. 
</P>
<P>
How did this act -- which almost sounds like a "Saturday Night Live" sketch, 
especially considering its crooned Spanish version of "My Way" -- come to this 
popularity? Even many in the crowd, while able to come up with some 
verbalization of why they were attracted to the music, seemed at a loss to 
explain why anyone else was there. 
</P>
<P>
For Venezuela-born Maria Mercedes, one of many who came to the concert in 
traditional flamenco garb and danced in the style on the Palladium floor 
throughout the evening, the show was a celebration of her cultural heritage. 
But the 28-year-old who now lives in Long Beach expressed "surprise" at the 
cultural range of the audience, which covered the whole socioeconomic spectrum 
of the Latino community, but also included a cross section of 
world-music-conscious yuppies and Rodeo Drive types. 
</P>
<P>
Observing the event was radio personality Dr. Demento, who has a degree in 
ethnomusicology and was equally gratified and mystified by the band's draw. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were popular," said Demento, whose real name is Barry Hansen, 
before the show began. "But I didn't know it was this big. . . . But this music 
is real accessible. Everybody's heard some flamenco at some time in their 
lives, and the Gipsy Kings pump it up to a different level." 
</P>
<P>
Proving his point to some extent, nearby stood a group of about half a dozen 
Southeast Asians dressed in stylish, '40s-inspired suits. "I love the Gipsy 
Kings, because I love flamenco music," said Kacy Ichi, 32, a Vietnam-born, 
French-schooled and now Encino-based fashion designer. 
</P>
<P>
As ex-"St. Elsewhere" star Ed Begley Jr. observed early in the two-hour 
performance, "We have a major demographic sweep here." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the concert made for perhaps the most colorful and joyous musical 
fiesta since Los Lobos and English/Irish punk-folk band the Pogues played the 
same hall in December, 1986. But for all that, the music was not overshadowed. 
</P>
<P>
Sexy is the only word that adequately describes the Kings' style, anchored by a 
rhythmic pulse driven by a phalanx of six strummed flamenco guitars and 
compounded by bass, keyboard, drums and percussion backing. 
</P>
<P>
Like its Brazilian cousin, the music's melodic sense has a very European 
quality to it, especially in the crooning of lead singer Nicolas Reyes. But the 
Kings music also has a distinctly Mediterranean feel -- one highlight resembled 
the pop music coming out of North Africa these days. 
</P>
<P>
With that intensely visceral quality to it, questions about the band's appeal 
(and it's ability to outlast the undeniably novelty aspect of its current 
success) may prove nothing more than academic. 
</P>
<P>
The answer may have been provided by one yuppie-looking woman exiting from the 
concert. With a wistful sigh, she said, "I want to keep dancing!"

'HARD TIMES' A GOOD TIME AT SCR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his "Hard Times," Charles Dickens assailed those teachers who wanted to cram 
children's heads with facts at the expense of the imagination. So it's entirely 
fitting that the staging of this 1854 novel, now at South Coast Repertory's 
Second Stage in Costa Mesa, is a triumph of the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Adapter Stephen Jeffreys spurned the scenic detail and enormous casts of the 
Dickens movies. Instead, he relied on our ability to imagine -- that five 
actors were really 19 wonderfully varied characters, that an almost bare stage 
was really a grimy armpit of the Industrial Revolution, that these oppressed 
and depressed people might break into song at crucial moments. 
</P>
<P>
In the story, the schoolmaster Gradgrind instructs his pupils to reject art 
that isn't absolutely realistic. Defying Gradgrind's advice, Jeffreys and his 
precursors, the people who put together the Royal Shakespeare Company's 
"Nicholas Nickleby," not only celebrated the imagination, but they also 
celebrated the stage as one of the best places to exercise that imagination. 
</P>
<P>
At South Coast, actors and audience alike get an invigorating workout. 
</P>
<P>
True, the audience must sit for 3 1/2 hours, stirring only during two 
intermissions. (The show begins an hour earlier than most Second Stage 
productions.) But that's not as long as the installments of "Nicholas," and the 
story moves swiftly. There's a slight sag during the second act, but -- as in 
"Nicholas" -- the material is so rich that any momentary restlessness soon 
dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the audience's role is not just to absorb everything but also to 
make the connections between "Hard Times" and our times. Jeffreys' script is 
more insistent about this than was "Nicholas"; in a closing chorale, he 
directly challenges us to make those connections. 
</P>
<P>
Yet director Robert W. Goldsby hasn't inserted contemporary references: to 
trickle-down economics, for example, or to those parents who parade fact-filled 
flash cards in front of their babies. He lets the audience draw its own 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The actors' workout here calls for immense physical and technical skills, in 
addition to the imaginative powers required of the audience, and these actors 
demonstrate Olympian prowess. 
</P>
<P>
The two women in the main cast of five (two extras fill out peripheral parts) 
play five roles each. Anni Long makes the most spectacular leaps between 
characters. She plays Sissy Jupe, an independent-minded girl; whining Mrs. 
Gradgrind (who wishes she never had a family -- then they would know what it's 
like to do without her); a couple of weavers at the Coketown mill, and snippy 
Mrs. Sparsit, who wants us to understand how low she has stooped in order to 
become an industrialist's housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Long's creation of Mrs. Sparsit is abetted by a pretentious headdress and a 
mask with a fiercely pointed nose -- the handiwork of set and costume designer 
Ariel. This and other masks help camouflage the actors as they switch roles and 
also sum up characters in visual shorthand. And the use of a mask on Gradgrind 
leads to an illuminating moment, late in the second act, when the mask comes 
off to reveal the man under the cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Jarion Monroe plays Gradgrind as well as the seducer of Gradgrind's daughter -- 
perhaps the evening's most startling transformation. He fills out the role of 
the seducer, which Jeffreys may have been trimmed a bit too much, so that we 
understand this fellow fully. In the pivotal role of Gradgrind's daughter, 
Devon Raymond creates some of the play's most tragic images -- yet also finds 
the resources to play four smaller roles with finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sicular astonishes with his brief bits as Bitzer, the hilarious young 
model student with an exotic blond haircut, as much as with his more 
substantial roles as bigwig Josiah Bounderby and as Gradgrind's foolish son 
Tom. And Art Koustik, though stuck with two almost equally sympathetic 
characters, carefully delineates the differences. 
</P>
<P>
Ariel designed a floor and created a rear platform and backdrop, artfully lit 
by Peter Maradudin, that suggest the economic and the pedagogical imperatives 
of the era. Robert MacDougall's score and sound track constantly supports the 
action and occasionally ascends to the surface of the show. Singing isn't the 
cast's strong suit, but it's a problem only in the closing chorale; earlier, 
the raw and sometimes faltering voices make their own point about these 
people's lives. 
</P>

 At 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m., 
Sundays at 7 p.m., weekends at 2 p.m., through April 16. Tickets: $20-$25;

A federal judge has set May 24 for a hearing on a lawsuit filed by a group of 
real estate investors who are suing talk-show host Morton Downey Jr. for 
allegedly selling them worthless plots of land in the California desert, 
advertised as being laden with gold. The class action suit, filed in December 
in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, charges that in 1982-83 Downey bilked 
investors out of $10 million to $20 million. Downey, 56, whose controversial TV 
show is taped in Secaucus, N.J., told a Hackensack newspaper (The Record) over 
the weekend that the complaint is unfounded. ALEENE MacMINN and CLAUDIA PUIG

The 39th Annual Eddie Awards for cinema editors was held this weekend at the 
Beverly Hilton Hotel with a tie vote for best editing of a feature motion 
picture shared by Gerry Hambling for "Mississippi Burning" and Stu Linder for 
"Rain Man." "Thirtysomething" editors Victor DuBois and Steven Rosenbloom won 
best editing of an episode from a television series. Career achievement awards 
were presented to Warren Low for a career that began more than 50 years ago and 
earned him four Academy Award nominations, and to Dorothy Spencer, whose first 
feature editing credit was in 1929 and who has also been nominated for four 
Oscars. ALEENE MacMINN and CLAUDIA PUIG

Sydney Pollack, the Oscar-winning American director, says he is planning to 
film a love story set in the turmoil of Cuba a week before the triumph of its 
1959 revolution. In Havana for the Cuban Film Institute's 30th anniversary 
celebration, the director of "Out of Africa" and "Tootsie" told Cuban 
television Saturday that he is thinking of using Cuban actors for the film. He 
did not elaborate, however, and did not say whether the film will be shot in 
Cuba. Pollack first visited Cuba in 1986 for the annual Latin American Film 
Festival. ALEENE MacMINN and CLAUDIA PUIG

Academy Award-winning film-maker Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 80, in San Francisco to 
receive the 1989 Akira Kurosawa award for lifetime achievement from the San 
Francisco International Film Festival: "I don't know anything about Hollywood 
today. I don't know the people. . . . I'm very sad that American film has 
become, in my opinion, the major motivation for the American being as detested 
as he is throughout the world. All they see in American movies is variations on 
obscenity, boozing and (sex) . . . and they'll look you in the eye and say, 
'Yeah, I know. Isn't it awful?' They're crying all the way to the bank." ALEENE

STRONG-VOICED MERRILL OFFERS AGELESS RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BURROUGHS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Merrill defies the stereotype of the aged singer who relies on what Anna 
Russell lampooned as "Grrreat ahtistry" to compensate for a vanished voice. 
</P>
<P>
The renowned baritone, who turns 72 in June, strode on stage at Marsee 
Auditorium at the South Bay Center for the Arts on Friday night and served 
immediate notice in Handel's "Thanks Be to Thee" that his voice is in a 
remarkable state of preservation. Wontedly warm, ringing and steady at once, it 
only got better the more he sang. 
</P>
<P>
This was all to the good because Merrill has never involved himself much with 
emotional meaning, textual nuance or refined musicality. It was always his 
sound that communicated, and it still is. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, not everything goes equally well now. The top of the voice is a 
matter of the moment. A high note emerging as a desperate woof in one phrase 
may be secure and splendid in the next. 
</P>
<P>
The historic chasm between Merrill's musical best and worst remains as ever: 
Mozart arias were unpardonably inept, those of Gershwin super. 
</P>
<P>
Signature arias from "Barbiere di Siviglia" and "Carmen" no longer flow easily, 
even transposed down, yet aren't so far from the current Met standard of much 
younger singers. Spirituals, "Fiddler on the Roof" and Irving Berlin medleys 
demonstrated vocal abundance and personal warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Diligent accompanist Marion Merrill displayed musical affinities identical to 
her husband's. BRUCE BURROUGHS

POP CAPSULES: A METAL CHURCH FOR EXCLUSIVE WORSHIPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANISS GARZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Metal Church is one of those classic heavy bands that seems destined never to 
gain mainstream acceptance. Maybe that's what filled the Country Club with 
worshipers for the group's Saturday night show -- with dozens of metal bands 
crossing over to the pop world, this may be one the metal-heads get to keep to 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are willing to listen with an open mind, however, the veteran 
Seattle-based quintet offers more than standard heavy-handed fare. Such epic 
songs as "Anthem to the Estranged," from the group's new "Blessing in Disguise" 
album, have moody rhythmic changes and beautifully textural guitars. 
</P>
<P>
On its current tour, Metal Church is sporting a couple of new members -- 
guitarist John Marshall and vocalist Mike Howe. The lion's share of the 
attention went to Howe, who, in spite of his slight frame and boyishly handsome 
face, has a wide-ranging singing style that is downright vicious. 
</P>
<P>
Opener Meliah Rage, with its beefy, bearded singer and brutal metal sound, was 
one-dimensional -- but with purpose. The Boston-based quintet's wall of angry 
sound traveled into the realm of self-parody and if that was the group's 
intent, it worked amusingly. 
</P>
<P>
Both bands will be performing at the Roxy tonight. JANISS GARZA

POP CAPSULES: TEPID GO-BETWEENS DON'T WORK UP PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On LP, the Go-Betweens traffic in a spritely, folkish, poppy sort of rock 
that's only occasionally marginally interesting -- mostly to aficionados of the 
form. On stage at the Palace on Friday, the Australian male-female quintet was 
substantially more mediocre than that. If it weren't for the absolute stupidity 
of co-lead vocalist-guitarist Robert Forster's performing in a house dress (an 
ugly house dress, mind you) or the almost merciful use of a slide show, the 
band would have had all the stage presence of the proverbial hole in the 
doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
The unfailingly tepid level of energy more than matched the uncanny lack of 
vocal character -- regardless of whether the spotlight was on Forster or 
singer-guitarist Grant McLannan -- and the material was as tuneful and pleasant 
as it was largely unmemorable. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting objectively, the band played an hour-plus, the room was mostly full, 
and the crowd neither threw bottles at the stage nor stormed the exits. After 
all, what was there to get worked up about? DON WALLER

MENDIETA EXHIBIT REVEALS LUSH, PRIMAL POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ana Mendieta? Wasn't she the Cuban-born artist married to sculptor Carl Andre? 
He was acquitted last year of charges that he pushed Mendieta out the 
34th-story window of their New York apartment to her death. 
</P>
<P>
There are major revelations in an exhibit of Mendieta's work at Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions (to April 23), but they're not the stuff of tabloids. 
They stem instead from the artist's stunningly original and passionate embrace 
of Eros, nature, ritual and primitivism. 
</P>
<P>
Mendieta was 36 when she died in 1985, but her work began to take its 
characteristic shape more than a decade earlier when she was finishing graduate 
school at the University of Iowa. Rejecting painting for the "magic" of 
performance, she used her own body to re-create a campus rape-and-murder scene 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter she discovered the rich symbolic lode of the Afro-Caribbean 
religion, Santeria, which borrowed from Catholicism and the culture of the 
African Yoruba tribe. Together with Pre-Columbian fertility symbolism, ardent 
feminism and the wisdom to limit herself to highly condensed, slyly reticent, 
minimal imagery, Mendieta had the tools she needed to convey lush, primal 
power. 
</P>
<P>
All her works register her visceral bodily involvement, but the earlier ones 
are literally inseparable from the circumstances or the places in which they 
were made. "Body Tracks" (Rastros Corporales) are long, blurry marks that her 
hands and forearms made as they slid down a large piece of white paper during a 
performance heightened with pulsing Cuban music. 
</P>
<P>
Mendieta's color photographs of pieces she made outdoors in Iowa and Mexico 
during the '70s show images of a female form -- usually her own petite body, 
sometimes the squat bulk of a Pre-Columbian figure -- appearing as if magically 
inhabiting an area of ground. One is a faint, almost unrecognizable outline in 
the grass, another is a cave-like silhouette burned into the landscape, yet 
another is made of red flowers that seem to be pouring out of a "violated" dead 
tree trunk. 
</P>
<P>
A group of black-and-white photographs captures the formal purity of limestone 
carvings of fertility images that Mendieta made during the second of two visits 
to Cuba, in 1981. She became reacquainted with the native land from which her 
well-meaning parents shipped her as a child during the Cuban Revolution. 
(Shunted back and forth in a blur of orphanages and foster homes with her 
sister and enduring racist taunts as a teen-ager, she came to think of the 
Earth as "the concrete conception of her homeland," according to the compelling 
videotape that accompanies the exhibit.) 
</P>
<P>
Later in the '80s, she would start to translate her simplified imagery into 
portable works: linear gouache and acrylic paintings on bark paper; 
spiral-imprinted sand pieces resting on the floor; and authoritative floor 
pieces made of cracked mud in elegantly reductive formats. 
</P>
<P>
Her last works in the show (curated by Petra Barreras del Rio and John 
Perreault) are particularly strong -- "Fernwoman" (Mujer de Helecho), untitled 
wooden slabs that lean against the wall and semicircular tree trunks carved and 
burned with gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
The macho quality of gunpowder contrasts piquantly with the variously 
leaf-like, labyrinth-like and mountain-like versions of female silhouettes. In 
one of the tree trunks, knobby protuberances poking past the immaculate, 
blackened shapes on the wood celebrate female sexual energy. The tree pieces 
were the basis for a project Mendieta was to have made for the MacArthur Public 
Art Program in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Made from an Osmunda fern root, "Fernwoman" (which is nearly 5 feet tall) is an 
densely knit, tactile black presence, a compact female form with a long head 
and gravity-dragged breasts. The striking purity of such work -- at once so 
coolly contemporary and so charged with implacable voodoo power -- confirms 
Mendieta's place among the most gifted of her generation.

CBS FAMILY COMEDIES: RELATIVELY FEW LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two comedies premiere back-to-back on CBS tonight (Channels 2 and 8). Neither 
is funny. 
</P>
<P>
"Live-In" (at 8 p.m.) finds pretty Australian Lisa Wells (Lisa Patrick) saying 
"G'day" as live-in help for the Mathews family of New Jersey. She's a 
mini-skirted nanny with a fanny, her assignment to care for the Mathews' infant 
daughter and elude the clutches of their older son Danny (Chris Young). 
</P>
<P>
Lisa gets mad when Danny and his friend (Lightfield Lewis) try to see Lisa in 
the nude. Then she gets mad when he tries to come on to her. Then he gets at 
her for rejecting him. This is dumb. 
</P>
<P>
G'bye. 
</P>
<P>
Following "Live-In" is "Heartland" (8:30 p.m.), which is CBS' answer to Fox's 
"Married . . . with Children," a sort of "Married . . . with Pigs." 
</P>
<P>
The setting is a Nebraska farm, home for Tom and Casey Stafford (Richard 
Gilliland and Kathleen Layman), their two sons (Jason Kristofer and Devin 
Ratray), adopted Vietnamese daughter (Daisy Keith) and Casey's father, B. L. 
McCutcheon (Brian Keith, in his seventh series). 
</P>
<P>
On the premiere, a tornado sends them all into the cellar for safety. The scene 
begins promisingly, but the family survives. 
</P>
<P>
B.L. is crusty, but yessssssss, lovable -- one of them-thar' lovable bigots. At 
least he looks like he belongs on a farm, compared with the rest of the family, 
who look like they're dressed up as farmers for a costume party. 
</P>
<P>
This is TV's new class -- the rural hip. Despite their words ("We got a big day 
tomorrow, boys. We gotta finish cuttin' that wheat"), you can't imagine these 
people with dirt under their nails or straw under their feet. 
</P>
<P>
The funniest thing about the opener is unintentional -- a scene where seven 
people (the family and a visitor) sit squeezed together around only half of the 
round kitchen table, leaving the other half open so that the camera will have a 
clear view of everyone from the front. 
</P>
<P>
Farm folk -- Hollywood style.

CONTINENTAL'S ATTENDANTS SET STRIKE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Continental Airlines' flight attendants will strike the company at airports 
around the country starting at 7 a.m. PST today, the president of the 
Continental flight attendants union disclosed in an interview Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The strike is likely to create further problems for beleaguered Texas Air 
Corp., whose other principal subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, has been the target 
of a strike since March 4 that has shut down 90% of its flights and prompted 
the company to seek protection from its creditors by filing in federal 
bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Disruption' 
</P>
<P>
The Continental strike "could cause a lot of disruption" of the company's 
operations, particularly because Continental has added more flights to its 
normal route structure since the Eastern strike began, Carla Winkler, president 
of the Union of Flight Attendants, said in a telephone interview from Houston, 
Continental's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The union represents about 6,800 flight attendants at several bases around the 
country, Winkler said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a work stoppage occurs, Continental is fully prepared to operate 100% of 
its schedule," company spokesman David Messing said early today. "We don't feel 
there would be any impact on us or our customers." 
</P>
<P>
Messing said Continental operates about 1,400 flights daily serving 120 cities 
in the United States and numerous foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler said her members authorized a strike by an 80%-20% vote in December and 
that the union has been free to strike since then. She said she expected strong 
support from the members for the strike, though she acknowledged that about 800 
of Continental's attendants are still probationary employees and thus less 
likely to participate in the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's flight attendants, although represented by a union, have been 
operating without a collective bargaining agreement since September, 1983, when 
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp., took Continental into bankruptcy 
and abrogated all his union contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been bargaining with Continental officials for more than five years 
attempting to get a new contract," without any success, Winkler said. "We're 
far and away the lowest-paid attendants in the airline industry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical Attendant 
</P>
<P>
A typical attendant with five years' experience at Continental makes $1,005 a 
month after taxes, Winkler said, compared to $1,752 a month after taxes for a 
typical American Airlines attendant with the same experience level. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Continental attendant will work more hours in a day and more days in a 
month, with shorter rest periods between assignments and has to pay more for 
health insurance," Winkler said. 
</P>
<P>
Continental has taken the position that it cannot pay its attendants as much as 
they would like, because the company is in poor financial condition. Indeed, in 
the last two years, Continental has lost $573.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, Winkler said, wages are not the only issues on which the two sides 
have failed to reach agreement. She said the company's "last and final offer" 
made to the union a year ago allows the airline to "contract out" some of the 
work now being done by Continental employees, allows the company to use foreign 
nationals on an unlimited basis on Continental flights abroad, permits the 
company to reopen the contract at any time it chooses and contained no minimum 
industry standards on working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
After the attendants rejected the proposal last spring by 80% to 20%, 
subsequent bargaining failed to produce significant improvements in the company 
offer, she said. Normally, in airline collective bargaining, which is governed 
by the Railway Labor Act, when negotiations reach an impasse, the government 
imposes a 30-day "cooling-off period" in hopes that an agreement can be reached 
without a strike. However, because there has been no collective bargaining 
agreement at Continental since 1983, both sides have been in what is known as a 
"self-help" situation, Winkler said. 
</P>
<P>
This means that management is free to impose the terms of its offer and the 
union is free to strike without there having been a prior "cooling-off period," 
Winkler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Work Rules 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, Continental imposed new work rules and some wage increases, Winkler 
said, adding that union officials continued to negotiate with Continental 
executives, including a meeting in mid-March with Joesph Corr, the company's 
chief executive, in hopes of averting a strike. She asserted that Continental 
could have improved its wage offer to the attendants substantially and still be 
paying wages well under the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
But those negotiations produced no changes in the company's position and the 
union's nine-member executive board decided that now was the appropriate time 
to strike. 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush keeps saying that the employees at Eastern should just sit down 
and bargain with Lorenzo," she said. "Well it takes two to bargain." 
</P>
<P>
Winkler, a 20-year veteran at Continental, said she hoped the fact that 
Continental's flight attendants are striking would make it clear to the 
traveling public and government officials that "the problem with Lorenzo isn't 
just at Eastern." 
</P>
<P>
Winkler said she expected some Continental pilots to honor the attendants' 
picket lines but she would not predict how many. 
</P>
<P>
She said the company had "cross-trained" 200 of its ground personnel, including 
reservations workers and secretaries, to do attendants' work after the union 
took its strike authorization vote in December. She said Continental currently 
has 70 attendants in training, in addition to the 800 probationary employees, 
most of whom, she said, are unlikely to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Airlines says it will start hiring replacements for picketing pilots.

SALVADOR RIGHTIST ELECTED PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
CRISTIANI ROLLS UP WIDE MARGIN AS HEAVY FIGHTING LIMITS VOTER TURNOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN SALVADOR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As widespread fighting Sunday between the army and Marxist guerrillas plus 
continuing intimidation by the rebels held down voter participation, Alfredo 
Cristiani -- the candidate for an ultra-right wing, anti-American party -- 
swept to a stunning and easy presidential victory. 
</P>
<P>
Based on unofficial computer projections, Cristiani -- the head of the 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena -- was headed for a triumph that 
would far surpass predictions that he would still need a runoff against the 
second-place finisher to succeed President Jose Napoleon Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani, a 42-year-old graduate of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., 
said he had 54% of the early count with projections indicating he could reach 
75%. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran networks were projecting a 62% vote for Cristiani against 32% for 
Fidel Chavez Mena, candidate of the incumbent Christian Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
Official results were not scheduled for release until this morning. Christian 
Democrat leaders would not concede on the record, but told reporters there 
seemed no way Cristiani would fall short of a majority, thus voiding the need 
for a runoff. "We're going to be a loyal opposition," said one. 
</P>
<P>
The election was the most violent since 1982, when the guerrillas staged major 
attacks against voting stations throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Two journalists were killed Sunday by government forces while a third died 
Saturday night after being shot by military troops. At least 23 guerrillas and 
six soldiers also died in battles on Sunday, defense ministry spokesmen said. 
They said fighting took place in 12 of the country's 14 provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as stunning as Cristiani's first-round victory was the poor showing of 
the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of non-Marxist socialist and other 
moderate leftist parties. 
</P>
<P>
The convergence was expected to finish with a strong-enough third to influence 
a runoff. However, the party was running fifth in the early returns. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani held a series of news conferences after the victory projections were 
released. He appeared determined to fight the harsh image he and his party 
have, saying the election campaign should be forgotten and the country should 
get on with "unifying the Salvadoran family." 
</P>
<P>
He had begun the day the clear favorite, but most predictions and opinion polls 
indicated he would fall short of the majority needed for a conclusive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the umbrella organization for 
five guerrilla forces that have been trying to overthrow the government since 
1980, had called for a boycott of Sunday's election and had sabotaged nearly 
all the nation's electric power and threatened to attack buses and other 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla coalition, known as the FMLN, has boycotted all four elections 
held since 1982. This year, they offered to take part if the voting were 
postponed until September and other guarantees were given to ensure a free 
campaign. However, when negotiations with the government collapsed, the 
guerrillas denounced the vote as a fraud carried out to promote U.S. foreign 
policy and perpetuate social injustice. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels called on their followers and sympathizers to boycott the vote and 
warned all campaign officials and workers to quit or else be considered part of 
the guerrillas' conflict with the military. 
</P>
<P>
This position was seen as damaging to the candidacy of Guillermo Ungo, a 
non-Marxist socialist who, although formally aligned with the FMLN, entered the 
election campaign, giving the country its first opportunity since 1977 to vote 
for a leftist candidate. 
</P>
<P>
When the FMLN announced its boycott, it promised not to attack any of the 243 
voting stations. On Sunday, however, the guerrillas menaced election officials 
and workers and carried out heavy combat operations against army forces in 
populated areas, further reducing voter participation that was already 
diminished by the rebels' earlier threats against road traffic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flashes of Gunfire 
</P>
<P>
With about 90% of the country without electricity or water, the darkness of 
early morning was disturbed by flashes of gunfire and flares and the sound of 
bombs set off by guerrillas in attacks on army units on the edge of San 
Salvador and in provinces throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Hard hit was Santa Ana, El Salvador's second-largest city, which normally is 
free of guerrilla activity; Berlin, San Agustin and San Francisco Javier in 
Usulutan province; Suchitoto in Cuscatlan province, and Chinameca, a town in 
San Miguel province. 
</P>
<P>
Voting was delayed several hours in most of those cities and canceled in San 
Agustin and San Francisco Javier. 
</P>
<P>
A two-hour gun battle took place in the San Salvador suburb of San Ramon when 
guerrillas struck at army troops guarding a water plant. At least one soldier 
was killed and another wounded in the fighting, which pinned down journalists 
drawn to the sound of the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Although about 1.8 million people of the country's 5.5 million are registered 
to vote, only about 1.2 million were expected to cast ballots, even though 
voting is mandatory -- a requirement easily checked, since every voter must dip 
a finger into a pot of indelible ink. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Voters Seen 
</P>
<P>
While there was an ebb and flow to the pace of the voting, depending on the 
level of violence, even some tranquil areas were notably lacking in voters. For 
instance, an election official in El Paraiso, an area often hit by the 
guerrillas in Chalatenango province, told reporters that he expected no more 
than 45% or 50% of the 4,500 registered voters to show up. 
</P>
<P>
In places where there was no conflict, people walked to polling places to make 
up for the lack of transportation, some taking four hours to make the round 
trip. In San Salvador, one polling place in the center of town looked like the 
ticket window of a Super Bowl stadium, with people having spent the night in 
order to vote early. 
</P>
<P>
And despite regulations prohibiting the military from interfering with the 
voting, soldiers searched all men as they waited for their ballots. "People are 
scared," said Carlos Rodolfo Alvarado, an election official. "They heard the 
firing last night." 
</P>
<P>
It had been predicted that a lower turnout would benefit Cristiani. Arena has a 
solid base of nearly 500,000 members who are considered far more organized and 
fervent in their support for their candidate than the Christian Democrats, who 
are badly split and demoralized from charges of corruption and inefficiency 
leveled at their party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Chances of Victory Go Up' 
</P>
<P>
"All of the Arena people will vote no matter what," said one diplomat, "so if 
the total is down, Cristiani's chances of a victory, even a first-round 
victory, go up." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Cristiani tried to soften Arena's image of a party 
still tied to the right-wing death squads and brutal military tactics of the 
early 1980s, when the organization was founded by former army Maj. Roberto 
D'Aubuisson, now a member of the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
D'Aubuisson has been charged publicly by President Duarte with engineering the 
1980 murder of Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, while former 
U.S. Ambassador Robert White says the Arena founder plotted the assassination 
of at least one American ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo Le Chevalier, Chavez Mena's campaign manager, has likened El Salvador 
to the Weimar Republic of Germany in the years after World War I. "Arena is the 
Nazi party, and D'Aubuisson is Hitler," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani, who is a millionaire coffee grower, denies that D'Aubuisson had any 
death squad links and angrily denounces foreign journalists who say they have 
found evidence that the former army officer planned last year to restart the 
deaths squads under the cover of providing security for Arena's National 
Assembly members. Cristiani also has suggested that Arena is now more moderate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lambasted U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The Arena candidate has lambasted the United States for its past support of the 
Christian Democrats and still suggests that the American Embassy secretly 
prefers Chavez Mena. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials indirectly acknowledge that the embassy, in both the 1982 and 
1984 elections, not only preferred Duarte over D'Aubuisson but also provided 
heavy financial aid and pressure to prevent an Arena victory. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez Mena agrees with American Ambassador William G. Walker that the United 
States has been neutral this time, but he says that stance amounts to "turning 
their back on their friends and supporters." 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani is, if not an enemy of Washington, hardly a friend. He has accused 
the United States of pushing El Salvador toward socialism by pressuring for 
land reform and supporting Duarte's nationalization of banks and export control 
boards, particularly that of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
He has promised to privatize the economy and roll back the already weak and 
largely ineffective land reform program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Step Up the War 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani has also pledged to step up the war against the guerrillas if they do 
not agree to a negotiated settlement soon. Human rights observers say this 
means an increase in civilian deaths and human rights abuses, since D'Aubuisson 
and other Arena leaders have called for harsh action against guerrilla 
sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths of the three journalists Sunday are likely to increase pressure by 
liberals in the U.S. Congress and elsewhere to reduce, if not eliminate, the 
huge American economic and military aid program to El Salvador, now averaging 
$1.2 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
Although the official American position is that the winner of a democratic 
election must be respected and judged on his policies, many officials express 
caution about Arena and have warned Cristiani that Congress will cut back on 
aid if he is perceived as a "false face" covering real control of Arena by 
D'Aubuisson. 
</P>
<P>
This warning to Arena was voiced, indirectly but publicly, in February when 
Vice President Dan Quayle visited here and said any increase in human rights 
violations would result in reduced, if not eliminated, American aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Want Democracy' 
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Arena candidate told reporters Sunday that the United States 
should mind its own business. "I hope the United States realizes that we want 
democracy with this effort we are making to vote," Cristiani said. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths of the three journalists led immediately to a dispute over the 
causes. Roberto Navas, a 28-year-old free-lance photographer working for 
Reuters news agency, was riding a motorcycle home from work about 9:30 p.m. 
Saturday when he was shot to death by a soldier guarding a roadblock near an 
air force base on the outskirts of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger on the motorcycle, Luis Galdamez, another free-lance photographer, 
said they had been waved through the roadblock and were approaching another 
soldier when they were shot from behind. Navas was killed immediately, and 
Galdamez was hospitalized with serious bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Army spokesmen said the two men had run two roadblocks and were shot after 
refusing to stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Car Allegedly Refused to Stop 
</P>
<P>
Another journalist, Mauricio Pineda de Leon, a television sound technician for 
a Salvadoran TV network, was shot to death by a soldier Sunday morning near the 
eastern city of San Miguel. The army contended that the car carrying Pineda de 
Leon refused to stop and was fired on after it ignored a warning shot. Others 
in the car denied the army's version. 
</P>
<P>
The third slain journalist was Cornelio Lagrouw, a cameraman for Dutch national 
television. He and several other reporters and photographers were in the town 
of San Francisco Javier on Sunday morning after it had been captured by the 
FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
They were caught in a crossfire when the army counterattacked, and Lagrouw was 
killed by a bullet to the chest. When his colleagues tried to remove Lagrouw's 
body, an army helicopter fired on the road and prevented their leaving the area 
for several minutes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters, the Salvadoran Press Corps Assn. and human rights groups have called 
for an immediate investigation into the deaths. Since 1980, about 25 
journalists have been killed in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EL SALVADOR'S ELECTION AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Overview -- Presidency at stake; 1.8 million out of 5.5-million population 
eligible to vote, but smaller turnout expected. Running are 7 candidates 
representing 13 parties. Winning more than 50% of vote would be automatic 
first-round victory; April runoff is more likely. 
</P>
<P>
Issues -- With history of coups and military rule, El Salvador has its first 
chance to vote out incumbent, elected civilian government. In background is 
nine-year guerrilla war that has cost at least 45,000 lives. Vote is being 
closely watched by United States, which has given Salvadoran government $3 
billion in aid this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Key Players: 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Cristiani -- Front-runner, 42, candidate of Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, or Arena; coffee grower, Georgetown University graduate and 
free-market advocate, drafted in 1985 to lead party away from its far-right 
image. Roberto D'Aubuisson -- Not a candidate, the co-founder of Arena remains 
its most charismatic figure. The volatile former army intelligence officer, who 
ran for president in 1982 and 1984, is dogged by accusations from U.S. and 
Salvadoran governments that he participated in paramilitary violence in 
bloodiest days of war against leftist rebels in early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Fidel Chavez Mena -- Candidate of centrist, currently ruling Christian 
Democratic Party, which most polls show in second place. Party leader is 
outgoing President Jose Napoleon Duarte, longtime supporter of U.S. policy in 
region and opponent of neighboring, Marxist-led Nicaragua. Duarte's 
administration is accused of widespread corruption. He has liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Ungo -- Candidate of Democratic Convergence, coalition of non-Marxist 
socialist and moderately leftist parties aligned with rebels. One of its 
leaders, Ruben Zamora, returned from exile last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Guerrillas -- Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front is umbrella 
organization for five Marxist groups seeking to topple government. Guerrillas 
have boycotted every election this decade, accusing San Salvador of ignoring 
people's basic problems. They have called for boycott of voting, threatened to 
kill election workers and warned motorists that roads would be mined.

Negotiators i Amsterdam reached agreement on the conditions for an infusion of 
$26 billion to the InterAmerican Development Bank, a bank spokesman for the 
bank in Washington, said the differences between the United States and Latin 
American nations over the conditions for the bank's recomposition of capital 
were overcome in a meeting in Amsterdam. "As such the capital increase will 
occur," Sotero said. "It (the agreement) authorizes the bank to increase its 
lending capacity by $22.5 billion." The meeting included the finance ministers 
of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and a representative of the United

Gov. George Deukmejian's previous five appointees to the state Supreme Court 
had one thing in common: All were experienced judges with well-established 
records that invited predictions of the moderately conservative course they 
since have followed on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no bold, sweeping prophecies being made about the governor's 
newest nominee, Appellate Justice Joyce L. Kennard of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"She's climbed the ladder so fast -- one year on the Municipal Court, one year 
on the Superior Court and one year on the Court of Appeal -- that no one can 
know for sure what she will be like when she settles in on the Supreme Court," 
said UC Berkeley law professor Stephen R. Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kennard obviously knows the existing law well," he said. "The question will 
be how she will deal with the ideological and philosophical dimensions of 
making the law. It will be very interesting for everyone -- including the 
governor -- to see how she turns out." 
</P>
<P>
Legal authorities do say that based on the limited number of opinions she has 
written, they expect the 47-year-old Kennard -- if confirmed as expected -- to 
be as tough on criminals as the other Deukmejian appointees on the court. 
</P>
<P>
But there is considerable uncertainty over how she will perform in major civil 
cases. Her opinions show no tendency to favor either plaintiffs or defendants, 
nor can they be interpreted as necessarily "pro" or "anti" business. In one 
case, for example, she ruled against an insurance company, but in another, an 
insurer came out the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Although the newly aligned court has sided with business more than its liberal 
predecessor, some important civil decisions have come on 4-3 votes -- such as 
its ruling in December substantially limiting damages employees may collect for 
wrongful discharge. And observers say Kennard's role could prove pivotal as new 
issues arise in the civil arena in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"She is definitely going to be an important member of this court," said Fred J. 
Hiestand of Sacramento, counsel for the Assn. for California Tort Reform. 
"There have been a number of close decisions, and she could tilt the court in a 
different direction." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities do not see Kennard's relative lack of judicial experience as a 
major impediment to success on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Useful Background 
</P>
<P>
Her five years as a lawyer in the criminal division of the attorney general's 
office, followed by seven years as a senior staff attorney doing legal research 
on the Court of Appeal, could provide useful background for her work on the 
high court, they say. And, they add, an open mind can be as beneficial as 
judicial experience when it comes to deciding the cases that come before the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think that when justices come on the Supreme Court they are not 
committed to any preconceived agenda," said Harvey R. Levine of San Diego, 
president of the California Trial Lawyers Assn. "The position is so important, 
affecting so many lives and economic interests, that it's better they come on 
thinking about the issues in a fresh and independent way." 
</P>
<P>
Kennard's unique background and personal qualities are other factors seen as 
weighing in her favor. Born in Indonesia of a Dutch father and 
Chinese-Indonesian mother, she spent part of her childhood in a World War II 
internment camp in West Java, migrated with her widowed mother to Holland, 
survived the loss of a leg and then came to Los Angeles at age 20 to take a job 
as a secretary. Later, after her mother died, she used a $5,000 bequest to 
enter college, finishing up with a Phi Beta Kappa undergraduate degree and a 
law degree, both from USC. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Philibosian, a Los Angeles lawyer and former chief assistant state 
attorney general and Los Angeles County district attorney, recalls Kennard's 
departure from the Department of Justice as "the greatest loss we ever had in 
the criminal division." 
</P>
<P>
"Every place she's been in the system she's drawn rave reviews from 
experienced, critical, hard-nosed people," said Philibosian. "She is no apple 
polisher. She's very independent and she's going to be an excellent justice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experienced as Judges 
</P>
<P>
The five justices previously appointed by the governor had extensive 
backgrounds on the bench. Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, appointed as an 
associate justice in 1984, had spent 17 years as a state and federal trial 
court judge. Justice Edward A. Panelli, taking office in 1985, had served 13 
years as a judge. Justice John A. Arguelles had been a judge for 24 years, 
David N. Eagleson for 17 years and Marcus M. Kaufman for 17 years when they 
were appointed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Kennard's career on the bench began Feb. 28, 1986, when she took 
the oath to become a judge on the Los Angeles Municipal Court. Deukmejian 
elevated her to the Superior Court in 1987 and to the Court of Appeal in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The opinions she has issued as an appellate justice are seen by legal scholars 
as concise, clearly written and generally well reasoned. "She is willing to 
call the pitches as they come over the plate, without regard to who the parties 
in the case are," said Barnett. "Her opinions are wonderfully direct." 
</P>
<P>
Since her nomination to the high court, much attention has focused on a civil 
decision filed in 1987 when she was a Superior Court judge serving temporarily 
on the Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for a unanimous three-member panel, Kennard upheld a $5-million 
punitive damage award against an insurance company for refusing in bad faith to 
pay benefits to a savings and loan association allegedly defrauded by one of 
its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard rejected the insurer's contention that the award was excessive, 
amounting to nearly 2% of its net worth. She noted that other courts had upheld 
awards representing over 3% of a company's net assets. "Because the purposes of 
punitive damages are to punish the wrongdoer and make an example of him, the 
wealthier the wrongdoer, the larger the award of punitive damages," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basis of Decision 
</P>
<P>
She also turned down the company's claim that the big damage award violated the 
federal constitutional prohibition against excessive fines. "The 8th Amendment 
applies only to criminal actions, not to purely civil penalties, as involved 
here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, an advocate for plaintiffs' lawyers, is enthusiastic about Kennard's 
opinion in the case. "This was a very important ruling," he said. "It was 
probably one of the best I've seen in the punitive damages field in its legal 
analysis and reasoning." 
</P>
<P>
But Hiestand, speaking for defense lawyers, is concerned that Kennard had too 
easily dismissed the constitutional issue of excessive penalties -- a question 
that now is under review in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. "The matter 
is not nearly so clear as she states," he said. "Her treatment of the issue 
seems a bit cavalier." 
</P>
<P>
In another civil case, however, Kennard wrote the majority opinion in a 2-1 
ruling in favor of an insurance company that had been sued on the grounds that 
it improperly failed to provide a policy broad enough to protect all the 
personal assets of apartment building owners facing a negligence suit. 
</P>
<P>
There was no showing in this case that the insurer knew the extent of the 
owners' assets, nor was there proof the owner would have been willing to pay a 
higher premium for expanded coverage, Kennard said. Thus, the insurer had no 
duty to provide complete liability coverage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuit Reinstated 
</P>
<P>
In a another ruling issued last December, Kennard reinstated a lawsuit brought 
by a 74-year-old widow against an attorney who allegedly told her falsely that 
a bench warrant had been issued against her for failing to pay a debt. 
</P>
<P>
While state law provides lawyers some protections for their actions during 
litigation, in this case the attorney's "blatantly false statements" appeared 
not only unethical but possibly criminal, and the widow could pursue her suit, 
the justice said. 
</P>
<P>
Most criminal convictions that come before the state Court of Appeal are upheld 
and, in her limited service on the court, Kennard has ruled consistently 
against criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
In one of her first decisions, Kennard refused to overturn the conviction of a 
murder defendant who sought a new trial because his first lawyer was removed by 
a judge for not being ready for trial 17 months after she received the case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer's failure to offer good reason for the delay, and refusal to say 
when she would be ready for trial, "constituted undue delay and a disruption of 
the orderly process of justice," Kennard wrote for a unanimous court. 
</P>
<P>
In a case decided last July, she upheld the conviction in a burglary and 
attempted rape case, rejecting the defendant's claim that he should have been 
placed in a police lineup with other people rather than being identified at his 
residence soon after the crime by the victim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assessment of Error 
</P>
<P>
In another issue in the case, prosecutors conceded that the trial judge had 
improperly allowed jurors to consider the fact that the suspect had fled from 
the scene of the crime as evidence of guilt. But they argued that the error was 
harmless in view of other evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, in a relatively unusual action, refused to accept the prosecutors' 
concession of error, finding instead that the jury was properly allowed to 
consider flight from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, in another unanimous opinion, Kennard turned down an attempt by a 
defendant to have stricken from his record, after completion of his probation, 
a conviction for receiving stolen property. The panel ruled that the dismissal 
should be denied because the defendant had failed to fully pay $2,571.65 in 
court-ordered restitution as required under terms of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Kennard wrote a unanimous opinion allowing illegally obtained 
evidence to be used in revoking the probation of a defendant who was arrested 
while carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, citing a decision by the appellate court in another case, said that 
under Proposition 8, the anti-crime initiative passed by voters in 1982, such 
evidence was relevant and thus admissible in probation revocation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Kamenir-Reznik of Los Angeles, president of California Women Lawyers and 
a close acquaintance of Kennard, makes no predictions on how the new justice 
would vote on important criminal or civil questions, or how she would react on 
such politically sensitive issues as abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not a knee-jerk person," Kamenir-Reznik said. "She's an independent 
person who will use her legal knowledge and her reasoning skills and reach her 
decisions on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Other authorities draw similar impressions of the new nominee. "She's well 
regarded in terms of her judicial capacity," said Gerald F. Uelmen, law dean at 
Santa Clara University. "She's generally seen as a conservative justice, but 
not any sort of ideologue." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kamenir-Reznik: "This is an unusual woman, one who embodies the American 
dream. She's endured a lot of adversity and beaten the odds to come out on 
top."

CALLS RECREATIONAL ABUSERS ACCESSORIES TO 'MURDER, MAYHEM'; 
</P>
<P>
BENNETT WOULD TARGET 'YUPPIE' DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
William J. Bennett, head of the Administration's war on drugs, said Sunday he 
believes it is time for the federal government to go after "recreational, 
yuppie" drug users, saying they share responsibility for "the murder and mayhem 
in Washington, the fact that we have babies now being born addicted to cocaine" 
and the killings of Drug Enforcement Administration agents in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are accessories to all those things, and they need to start 
paying a price for that," Bennett said in an appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, estimating that 70% of the cocaine used in this country is consumed by 
recreational users, dismissed the idea of enacting tough, mandatory prison 
sentences for these individuals, saying: "It's easy to say, but where are you 
going to put people?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Put Picture in Paper 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said: "There are other things you can do. Suggestions that have 
been made to me are: Let's put their picture in the newspaper. Let's have a 
mandatory fine -- $5,000 to $10,000. If you're using cocaine and driving around 
in your BMW, when you get stopped, you lose your BMW." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett has moved swiftly to establish his drug war agenda, beginning last week 
with his effort to persuade President Bush to reverse his earlier opposition to 
curbing the spread of assault weapons. The Bush Administration acted quickly 
and imposed an immediate temporary ban on the importation of more than 110,000 
AK-47s, Uzi carbines and other semiautomatic weapons until the government 
decides whether they are suitable for "sporting purposes." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Sunday, however, that there are differing views among federal 
officials involved in the drug war over how far the Administration should move 
on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, appearing on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," 
seemed to be at odds with Bennett, insisting that "there is a historic and 
honorable firearms tradition in this country . . . recognized in the 
Constitution." Careful study should precede action, he said, warning that "you 
can't pass a law and think you're going to solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But DEA chief John C. Lawn, speaking on CBS' "Face the Nation," seemed to 
indicate that he would go far beyond Bennett, preferring a complete ban on all 
semiautomatic weapons, including those manufactured in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downplays Legal Solutions 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh predicted that the war on drugs will be won "on the battlefield of 
values" rather than through increased law enforcement or hotly debated controls 
on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"These battles aren't going to be won in the courtroom, they're going to be won 
in the classroom and the community, in the family and every institution that we 
have in our society that's going to face up to the problem of drugs and deal 
with it squarely and directly," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl whether she was correct in 
assuming that he wanted semiautomatics "to be banned across-the-board -- 
manufacture, sales, imports, everything," Lawn replied: "You are." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Lawn said: "The real crux of the problem about violence in our 
society, about drug abuse in our society, is that there really is no penalty. 
Individuals can be arrested, law enforcement personnel can get out and do their 
job, but because there are no prisons, there is no real fear of incarceration 
among the criminal element." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett did not elaborate on what the Bush Administration will recommend in the 
way of going after drug users, although he said "we'll propose something, 
obviously." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Ideas Out There' 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We're going to look at all the options. I've got a lot of consulting 
to do. Right now, I'm having a series of meetings with the people out there in 
the country who are expert on this -- meeting with eight or 10 people a day -- 
it's been three or four times a week, anyway -- getting their advice from the 
law enforcement side and the treatment side. I'm talking to the Hill. There are 
a lot of ideas out there." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who has denied public allegations that he is a 
cocaine user, criticized the characterization of Washington as the "murder 
capital of the country" for its record high drug-related slayings, and 
suggested that it was the federal government's responsibility to wipe out the 
drug business by sending the military to Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"The national government needs to go to these five or six countries in South 
and Central America, send the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines and 
the Coast Guard," he said on the ABC program. "Burn up those fields, eradicate 
those coca leaves, blow up those labs -- stop it at the source."

SHUTTLE DISCOVERY CAME BACK TO GARAGE IN MINT CONDITION

A preliminary inspection of Discovery indicates that it returned from its 
five-day mission apparently in better condition than any space shuttle ever 
had, with only 10 of its thermal protection tiles in need of replacement, NASA 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They said the tires, brakes and engines also performed well. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to go back and look" at mission records, "but I doubt if we could even 
find one that looks this good," said Discovery Flow Director Tip Talone, who 
coordinates processing of the orbiter for each flight. 
</P>
<P>
A day after Discovery landed, technicians said they counted only 82 "hits" on 
Discovery's tiles and only 15 were bigger than one inch, said Jay Honeycutt, 
director of shuttle management and operations at Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The previous shuttle mission ended with 707 debris hits on the orbiter. 
</P>
<P>
Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure monitor snapped 
as the right main landing gear dropped, said Cindy Lodge, a director for the 
shuttle tile system that shields orbiters from the fiery re-entry. Only one of 
those five tiles will need to be replaced, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The two 10-inch wires and printed circuit board from the pressure monitor were 
found on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Talone said the wires, which run down the landing gear strut, apparently got 
tangled and yanked the circuit board out when the gear came down. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery blasted off Monday from Kennedy Space Center and in six hours 
accomplished its major goal, deploying a $100-million Tracking and Data Relay 
Satellite.

HOUSE PANEL ASSAILS FAA WARNINGS

Terrorism warnings issued by the Federal Aviation Administration before the 
bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Scotland were largely ineffective and 
sometimes "dangerously inaccurate," the head of a House subcommittee said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.), chairwoman of the House Government Operations 
subcommittee on government activities and transportation, voiced the criticism 
in releasing an analysis of 33 FAA security bulletins issued between Jan. 1, 
1988, and Feb. 16 of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The panel found that at least six of the security bulletins contained 
information that may be linked to the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing of the Pan Am 
plane, which killed 270 people. Investigators have concluded that the jet was 
blown up by plastic explosive hidden inside a radio-cassette player. 
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, these and other FAA bulletins were sometimes untimely, sometimes 
dangerously inaccurate and almost completely devoid of effective and specific 
instructions for countering possible threats," Collins said. "Some bulletins 
recommended actions that were pointless or even absurd." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West German Arrests 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee focused particular attention on a warning written on Nov. 17, 
after the arrest in West Germany three weeks earlier of members of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. 
</P>
<P>
The bulletin described a bomb found in the raids -- plastic explosive secreted 
inside a radio-cassette player, with a barometric-pressure detonator designed 
to explode the device at a preset altitude. 
</P>
<P>
According to the subcommittee, that bulletin mistakenly advised that the 
PFLP-GC "has not been known to undertake terrorist attacks in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
A recent Defense Department study said the Palestinian group had machine-gunned 
an airliner in Zurich, hijacked two other airliners bound for European cities 
and warned in 1986 that "there will be no safety for any traveler" on a U.S. 
airliner.

LABORITES SUSPECT A COVER-UP

Britain's opposition Labor Party said Sunday that it suspects a cover-up by 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government in the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo 
jet after new revelations about a warning letter that was sent too late. 
</P>
<P>
The government admitted Sunday that a letter dated Dec. 19 -- two days before 
the crash -- was not sent to airlines until early January. A Transport 
Department spokesman said it was delayed because color photographs of a suspect 
radio-cassette recorder seized by West Germany had to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure prompted new demands for a statement by Transport Secretary Paul 
Channon or a public inquiry into the bombing, which killed 270 people, and its 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
Channon said Thursday that the letter was not sent out until "some days" after 
Dec. 19. His department's statement on Sunday appeared to be an admission the 
delay was even longer. 
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers said the Dec. 19 letter contained details that could have 
helped spot the bomb. "It all adds to the suspicion of confusion and cover-up," 
Byran Gould, a Labor spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sunday Express reported that the man who made the bomb that blew 
up the Pan Am flight and plotted the attack is a Libyan known to international 
security officials as "The Professor" because of his experience with 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
The London newspaper attributed its information to unidentified detectives and 
did not identify the suspect by name. It also repeated earlier reports that a 
Lebanese student, 21-year-old Khalid Jaafar, of Dearborn, Mich., unwittingly 
carried the bomb onto the flight in a radio-cassette player given to him as a 
gift.

A police officer, unable to see what was in the hands of a man who earlier had 
threatened his wife with a knife, shot and wounded the suspect Sunday as he 
came at him with a spoon, authorities said. The suspect, Andras Santana, 50, 
was in critical condition after being shot once in the chest by an officer 
identified as C. Murphy, police said.

HOPKINS CENTER AT NANJING FOSTERS FRANK EXCHANGES;

EAST MEETS WEST IN U.S.-CHINA COLLEGE VENTURE

<P>
Prof. Liu Lingyuan's afternoon class on Mao Tse-tung Thought had barely begun 
when one of his American students raised a potentially embarrassing question. 
</P>
<P>
Liu had just explained that the slogan "Seek Truth From Facts" -- made famous 
by China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, as a justification for pragmatic 
economic reforms -- is an ancient phrase that played a key role in the late 
Chairman Mao Tse-tung's political thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Please tell me," the student said, speaking Chinese with friendly politeness 
that could not hide the hard edge to his query, "during the Cultural 
Revolution, how was this 'Seek Truth From Facts' carried out?" 
</P>
<P>
The questioner, like everyone else in this class at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center 
for Chinese and American Studies, knew that Mao's chaotic Cultural Revolution 
of 1966-76 was a time when ideology reigned supreme and inconvenient facts were 
often ignored. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frank Response 
</P>
<P>
"At that time Mao Tse-tung didn't seek truth from facts," Liu responded without 
batting an eye. "His actions ran counter to his own theory." 
</P>
<P>
But in Mao's younger days, Liu went on, he used this slogan to defeat more 
dogmatic rivals within the Communist Party, and this helped account for some of 
the party's later successes. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange was typical of the frank discussion between Americans and Chinese 
that takes place at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, run jointly by Nanjing 
University and the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Situated at the edge of Nanjing University, in a building that resembles a 
suburban American hotel, the unique center brings together American and Chinese 
college graduates for an academic year of intensive study of each others' 
societies. The Americans, taught by Chinese professors, do all their course 
work in Chinese, while the Chinese study in English under American teachers. 
</P>
<P>
At most campuses in China, foreign students are isolated in separate 
dormitories and dining halls. But at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, Chinese and 
Americans room together and eat together. Within the walls of the center, the 
aim is to encourage the free exchange of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cultural Nuances Conveyed 
</P>
<P>
"People speak out very freely in and out of class, and that kind of openness is 
something that's special," said Richard Gaulton, the center's American 
co-director. 
</P>
<P>
"A great many cultural nuances . . . come across studying in Chinese that you 
would not necessarily get in an English-language class. In studying Mao 
Tse-tung thought, for example . . . there's just a special advantage in 
studying with someone who believes in what he's teaching . . . (who) 
understands it from in some ways an insider's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Other subjects offered the Americans include the Chinese economy, Chinese 
history and China's constitution. With its comfortable, U.S.-style facilities 
and some features rare for China, such as an open-stack library, the center is 
intended to be a model that eventually may exert wider influence in Chinese 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only institution I know of that has fully integrated Chinese and 
American management . . . and living arrangements," Arthur W. Hummel Jr., a 
former U.S. ambassador to China who has been involved with the project, 
commented recently on a visit to the center. "It's unique because it's so 
natural. . . . The exchange of administrative and academic experience is 
valuable to both sides." 
</P>
<P>
The center, which opened in September, 1986, was built to accommodate 50 
Americans and 50 Chinese a year, but it has had difficulty finding enough 
American students with enough knowledge of the Chinese language to cope with 
the course work. 
</P>
<P>
With 31 American students and 38 Chinese this year, every American has a 
Chinese roommate, while some Chinese must double up. The experience of living 
for a year with a Chinese roommate is considered one of the most important 
aspects of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great roommate," said Priscilla Armstrong, 25, a graduate of New 
York's Columbia University. "She's made all the difference in my stay here, 
because it's just so easy to learn different things about the Chinese people 
from her." 
</P>
<P>
Students do not earn degrees from the program, but some U.S. and Chinese 
universities give credit for work here toward the master's and doctor's 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Some American students feel that the center is so self-contained -- its 
classrooms, dining facilities, library, student store, professors' offices and 
student dormitory are all in a single air-conditioned building -- that it is 
isolated from mainstream Chinese life. They say the convenience of living at 
the center, combined with the heavy academic load, means that they do not get 
to mix in ordinary Chinese life as much as they would like to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Feels Confined 
</P>
<P>
"I think the metaphor for this country is walls," said Peter Aylward, 25, a 
University of Maryland graduate. "Everything in this country has a wall around 
it. I think your job, if you want to know this country, is to get beyond those 
walls. And it's a very difficult thing to do. For me personally, the center's 
not serving any tremendous benefit to my greater understanding of China. In 
fact, in a lot of ways it's restricting me." 
</P>
<P>
Gaulton, the co-director, points out that nearly all American students at the 
center have already had extensive experience in China or Taiwan and that what 
the program offers is rigorous academic instruction and in-depth contact with 
Chinese. For the Chinese students, the program offers the chance to experience 
many things about American campus life even if they cannot travel to the United 
States.

SUSPECT, LINKED TO PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, ARRESTED IN PROBE OF ASSAULT ON COUPLE

A suspect in the brutal assault last October of Aissa Wayne, daughter of the 
late actor John Wayne, and her financier boyfriend, Roger Luby, has been 
arrested, it was learned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Jail records showed that Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, was arrested 
Friday by Newport Beach police for investigation of criminal conspiracy, 
assault with a deadly weapon, assault on a person with a firearm, and force or 
violence on a witness. He was jailed in lieu of $1-million bail set by a 
Municipal judge, pending formal arraignment, probably today. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman Sunday refused to provide further information, saying 
official statements would be issued today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incident Recalled 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, 32, and Luby, 52, were confronted at his $3-million Newport Beach home 
Oct. 3, 1988, by two armed men who bound the couple, pistol-whipped them and 
warned them their life was in danger. One of the men slashed the Achilles' 
tendon in Luby's right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said one of the assailants, matching the description of the man 
in custody, warned Luby and Wayne: "You're (messing) with the wrong people. If 
you screw up again, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
In search warrants and affidavits filed Feb. 27 in Orange County Superior 
Court, Newport Beach police said they were seeking a "Jerry Hintergardt" for 
questioning in the case. Police said Hintergardt was an employee of O. Daniel 
Gal, a Los Angeles private investigator hired by Aissa Wayne's ex-husband, 
Pomona orthopedic surgeon Dr. Thomas A. Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
The court documents said the police had learned that Gal was seen in a car 
parked on the street near Luby's walled estate on the morning of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Description Provided 
</P>
<P>
The court papers also said that an employee of Gal's, identified as 
Hintergardt, fit an eyewitness' description of one of the two men involved in 
the assault. According to the witness, Glenn Torrez, one of the men he saw 
leaving the Luby home walked with a pronounced limp, was blond, and was about 6 
feet, 2 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt fits the description, according to an anonymous source who claimed 
to be a friend of the Hintergardt family. The source said he and Hintergardt 
family members were angry and concerned because of the "secrecy" surrounding 
the arrest and because the man was given such a high bail. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County deputy district attorney, who asked not to be quoted by name, 
said on Sunday, "A million dollars bail is very, very unusual in an assault 
case unless it's a VIP involved." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, in an interview Sunday at her Corona Del Mar home, said police had not 
told her of an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very upset I have not been notified," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Luby could not be reached, but a relative at his residence said Luby also had 
not been informed, 
</P>
<P>
Gal's private investigative firm was hired by Gionis during a child-custody 
battle involving the couple's divorce last summer, according to court records. 
The records said police found that Gal made seven telephone calls to 
Hintergardt on the day of the Wayne-Luby attack. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, on Jan. 30, won custody of his and Wayne's young daughter, Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge denied Wayne custody, calling her 
"emotionally immature," but allowed visitation rights every other weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gal nor Gionis could be reached for comment on Sunday.

REP. GINGRICH DISCLOSES OWN UNUSUAL BOOK MARKETING DEAL 
</P>

<P>
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who spurred the ethics investigation of House 
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) and focused attention on Wright's 55% book 
royalties, has an unusual book arrangement of his own. 
</P>
<P>
When Gingrich and his wife, Marianne, wrote the nonfiction book, "Window of 
Opportunity," with David Drake in 1984, they signed a contract to share a 
standard 10% hard-cover royalty. But they also took the unusual step of setting 
up a limited partnership, which raised $105,000 from Republican political 
activists and business people around the country, to promote sales of the book. 
Normally, a publisher pays for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, Gingrich said in an interview late Friday, was that a large publicity 
budget could "force a best-seller. I was real naive." 
</P>
<P>
The 21 investors in the COS Limited Partnership each put up $5,000 and were to 
split half of the publisher's profits. But sales of the book were modest, and 
there were no profits. The publisher, Jim Baen, of Baen Enterprises, lost money 
on the venture. This created a tax benefit for the partners. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich did not have a share of the partnership, but his wife said in an 
interview Sunday that she has been paid close to $10,000 by the partnership for 
her work as general partner. She said she put no money into COS but got a 2% 
share and thus a portion of the tax benefits from the partnership's continuing 
annual losses. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said the partnership was his idea. It spent $70,000 for 
promotion. Nearly $6,000 of the other $35,000 remains, Marianne Gingrich said, 
with the rest of the money going to her and for legal, accounting and other 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Baen, who did not know Gingrich before he met him at a conference on space and 
technology, said he has not entered into such a promotion partnership before or 
since and did not know of another like it in the publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich is running for election this week to replace former Rep. Dick Cheney 
(R-Wyo.), the new secretary of defense, as Republican whip, the second-ranking 
GOP leader in the House. Gingrich asked Friday if he could delay detailed 
responses about the partnership because it would be to his "disadvantage" to 
have a story appear before the whip election, saying that he had a book deal 
"equally as weird as Jim Wright's." 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich was first queried about the partnership arrangement last August, but 
only recently began providing documentation. In agreeing to answer detailed 
questions, he said his publishing venture differed from Wright's. "We wrote a 
real book for a real company that was sold in real bookstores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
House Democrats attacked Gingrich last year, in the wake of the Wright 
investigation, for a previous book partnership he set up in 1977. That 
partnership advanced him $13,000 to write a novel that was never published.

ASSEMBLY OF INVENTORS IS PATENTED TO BECOME A THINGAMAJIG PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.W. McGARRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The little man from San Diego had a gizmo in his back pocket. Michy Greenberg 
and Leonard Holtz had theirs in briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else had gizmos -- or thingamajigs or whatchamacallits -- on the mind. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 men and five women were members of, or prospective recruits for, the 
Inventors Workshop International Education Foundation, a nonprofit group that 
encourages, counsels and consoles inventors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offers a Challenge 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley chapter of the Camarillo-based foundation was meeting 
in a Panorama City bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick my pocket, just try," the guy from San Diego dared his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
They couldn't. Some kind of gizmo on the wallet snagged the pocket lining. 
</P>
<P>
Score one for the tinkerers. 
</P>
<P>
There is always the chance, of course, that someone else in the crowd was 
secretly perfecting an "anti-pickpocket-thwarter" device. That is the way 
invention has progressed. The spear gave rise to the spear thrower, the auto to 
the autobahn, artificial fibers to no-cling static repellents. As surely as the 
hip led to the Hula Hoop, every advance seems to need another advance to 
counter, enhance or decorate it. 
</P>
<P>
That's just fine with the inventors, who want the work. Patent rights, 
sometimes won only after hard haggling with the U.S. Patent Office, last only 
17 years, which the assembled inventors appeared to regard as an injustice on a 
par with the poll tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the stereotype of Tom Swift and His Wonderful Electric Yardstick, 
these were not precocious youngsters. Almost all appeared to be downstream from 
50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beer at 30 Yards 
</P>
<P>
Some already had sizable resumes. David Boyd of North Hollywood, who dreams up 
unlikely artifacts for entertainers, claimed credit for the "beer gun," which 
fires a stream of beer for comic effect. Powered by the natural effervescence 
of agitated beer, the gun can drench a tolerant audience member "at 30 yards," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty yards if you warm the beer first." 
</P>
<P>
The audience had come to hear Greenberg and Holtz ("local heroes," one listener 
described them) recount their successes. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, a Sherman Oaks office efficiency consultant, says he and his wife 
make about $20,000 a year inventing things for babies, inspired by the needs of 
their own toddler, Minda. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg markets a diaper-like seat liner for baby strollers, and Bibwypes, a 
reusable/disposable washcloth/bib. A device that looks like the brim of a large 
hat with no crown keeps shampoo from running into baby's eyes. Coming up: a 
spoon that talks to baby, saying things like "open wide, here comes food." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg is chairman of the workshop, which meets once a month, to which 
members can bring ideas, designs or models for critiques by their fellows. 
</P>
<P>
To ease fears that some colleague may rip off the design of, say, a 
solar-powered cat litter tray and beat them to the patent office, workshop 
meetings are open only to members, who must sign a pledge of secrecy. Greenberg 
explained with a straight face to prospective recruits: "If you ever breathe a 
word outside the workshop about another member's work, we cut your hands off. 
</P>
<P>
"It must work," he added. "In 19 years, that's never happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a Profit 
</P>
<P>
Holtz said he made $75,000 off the licensing rights to a clamp he invented for 
steel milling lathes, and "could have made $750,000" if he had known enough to 
get a lawyer to write the contract instead of trying to do it himself. 
</P>
<P>
He passed around an example, a slightly curved piece of yellow-painted steel 
about the size of a small child's shoe, with a cylindrical doohickey nestled 
into one side and holes here and there. Doubtless a thing of wonder to lathe 
operators, it is an object as incomprehensible to the uninitiated as something 
found in an archeological dig on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz's home is so filled with gadgets -- mirrors bounce infrared rays down a 
corridor to control a VCR in another room -- that it has starred in TV shows, 
he said. He turned a metal finish that gives off twinkling reflections, which 
he noticed rock musicians using for "psychedelic" decorations, into a popular 
fishing lure. 
</P>
<P>
He is working on a spray can that will work upside down, moved by his wife's 
complaints while trying to clean a toilet with an uncooperative cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
The life of an inventor is not all "Eurekas!" and royalties, both warned. 
</P>
<P>
Patent examiners can lay waste months of work. Holtz complained that his 
reversible, wet-or-dry-weather bicycle brake was rejected for bearing a minor 
similarity to brakes on Japanese freight cars. His machine to generate random 
numbers -- just the ticket for state lotteries -- had been patented in Norway 
in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eighth Grade Too Tough 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said he designed a game geared to eighth-grade mathematics "and found 
out that only three Americans in 100 could play it -- we aren't a literate 
enough nation anymore for eighth-grade games." 
</P>
<P>
Future sessions, the audience was promised, will include presentations by an 
electronics designer ("I have a plan for electronic wind chimes," someone 
commented) and "the man who invented the ant farm." 
</P>
<P>
As they left the room, the little man from San Diego did his number on Holtz, 
the canny mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
"Go ahead, pick my pocket," he dared him. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz tried and failed. He peeked into the pocket and eyeballed the device. 
Smiling, he tried again, shifting his grip. 
</P>
<P>
The wallet popped out like bread from a toaster. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the drawing board.

SUTTON CHANGES HIS MIND, QUITS AS KENTUCKY COACH 
</P>

Twenty-four hours after saying that resigning would be an admission of guilt, 
Eddie Sutton on Sunday announced his resignation as Kentucky basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted he was not forced to resign and that he is innocent of any 
wrongdoing in connection with 18 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. allegations 
against the program. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of Sutton's resignation, or possible firing, had circulated since last 
October, when the NCAA announced its charges. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, who Saturday had repeated his intention to remain as coach, said he 
changed his mind because of the increasing rumors about his status. One such 
report, which surfaced last Friday, said Sutton had offered to fire his 
assistants if he would be retained. 
</P>
<P>
"These instances have popped up and I think they will continue to do that, and 
I think people are going to get hurt and I can't see doing that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference, Sutton said he made his decision Saturday night after 
consulting with his family and doing "a lot of praying." 
</P>
<P>
He met Sunday with university president David Roselle, who, according to the 
coach, accepted the resignation and expressed thanks for Sutton's dedication to 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
During his own news conference Sunday night, Roselle said the question of 
Sutton's resignation had come up in a meeting last Wednesday at the president's 
residence on the Kentucky campus.

"We talked about it (resignation) -- what was good for the program," Roselle 
said of the session, which also included acting athletic director Joe Burke and 
university lawyer James Parke Jr., among others. 
</P>
<P>
Roselle praised what he called Sutton's "willingness to recognize that his 
resignation is a necessary step in the process of rebuilding our basketball 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Roselle added that the university athletics board was scheduled to meet Tuesday 
to discuss the basketball situation. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his leaving might soften any possible punishment meted out by the 
NCAA, Sutton said, "I would hope they would take it into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Roselle added: "One hopes that it does, but one does not do it for that 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
Roselle said Parke and Burke were en route to NCAA headquarters at Mission, 
Kan., to meet with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, during an interview on CBS-TV, Sutton said he was resigning 
"for one reason -- the love I have for the University of Kentucky, for the 
Kentucky basketball program and the people of the commonwealth." 
</P>
<P>
He cited recent "vicious" rumors about his status that he said had hurt and 
would continue to hurt a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how important basketball is to the people of the state, and I've 
decided for the good of the program, for the fans, for the players and most of 
all for my family, I should resign at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had 30 wonderful years of coaching. I've always tried to run the programs 
in the right way and I've done the same thing here. But I just feel like if 
this continues, it's going to hurt more and more people and I don't want the 
University of Kentucky basketball program to suffer anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton said he had informed most of the players, who were on spring break this 
week, and his assistants of his decision. Casey and assistants Jimmy Dykes and 
James Dickey could not be reached for comment Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Casey's lawyer, Joe Bill Campbell of Bowling Green, Ky., said he and Casey 
would not have a comment on the resignation or Casey's status until today. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 53-year-old Sutton, Kentucky had a 90-40 record, including two 
Southeastern Conference titles, but slumped to 13-19 this season, the first 
losing season at the school in 62 years.

SAN FELIPE HANDICAP; 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY SILENCE GIVES VALENZUELA A LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela said he had stomach flu on Saturday, and was so sick that he 
stayed home and passed up Santa Anita mounts on Lively One, a big winner in his 
4-year-old debut, and Claire Marine, who ran third in a $150,000 race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was throwing up all day and all night," Valenzuela said Sunday. "And if it 
hadn't been for this horse, I wouldn't have been here today, either." 
</P>
<P>
The horse that brought Valenzuela out of his sick bed was Sunday Silence, and 
he's also the colt who might take the jockey and trainer Charlie Whittingham to 
the Kentucky Derby. Sunday Silence is one race away -- the Santa Anita Derby on 
April 8 -- from Churchill Downs after his 1 3/4-length win in Sunday's $159,300 
San Felipe Handicap before a crowd of 38,428. 
</P>
<P>
Before the San Felipe, Sunday Silence had never run in a stake, had never had 
to make up six lengths on a horse in front of him and had never gone farther 
than 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Halo and Wishing Well took the winner's share of $91,800 in the San 
Felipe by effortlessly zipping past Yes I'm Blue on the turn for home and 
running 1 1/16 miles in an unspectacular time of 1:42 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
While Sunday Silence became a new presence on the national 3-year-old scene, 
Music Merci took a backward step and cast additional doubts about his ability 
to handle a distance of ground. All four of Music Merci's stakes wins have come 
at a mile or less, and the 1-2 favorite finished third in the five- horse San 
Felipe, 5 1/4 lengths behind Sunday Silence and 3 1/2 lengths behind Flying 
Continental, who staged a mild stretch run to take second. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who has won both of his starts this year after winning two out 
of three as a 2-year-old, was the second betting choice and paid $7.80, $3.80 
and $2.20. Flying Continental paid $4 and $2.20 and Music Merci paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who carried 119 pounds, five less than Music Merci, almost went 
to his knees leaving the gate, but was running right alongside the favorite 
down the backstretch as Yes I'm Blue set fast fractions on a track that seemed 
dull. The first half-mile mile was clocked in 45 1/5 seconds and six furlongs 
went by in 1:09 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence left Music Merci on the turn for home, easily disposed of Yes 
I'm Blue with a quarter-mile to run and was in no danger through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
With Easy Goer, the star from the East, everybody's favorite for the Kentucky 
Derby, Whittingham was asked after the San Felipe where this victory put Sunday 
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say we're among the top five or six horses now," said the trainer, 
who won the Kentucky Derby with Ferdinand in 1986. "We'll probably go to 
Kentucky with him after this, but the Santa Anita Derby will give us an even 
better idea." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela has ridden Sunday Silence in all but one of his races. 
</P>
<P>
"This is some kind of horse," he said. "The ground broke out from under him at 
the start, and we were four lengths behind going into the first turn. I tried 
to get him into the race without rushing him, hoping that he wouldn't run 
three-quarters (of a mile) and quit. 
</P>
<P>
"When I asked him at the quarter pole, he really picked it up. This is the best 
3-year-old I've ever been on." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela hasn't been close with two Kentucky Derby mounts, and in 1980, when 
as a 17-year-old he won the Santa Anita Derby with Codex, the horse was 
inadvertently omitted as a nominee for Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence has been no sleeper, because in the third race of his career, at 
Hollywood Park on Dec. 3, he almost beat Houston, another lightly raced colt 
who's considered one of the Kentucky Derby contenders. 
</P>
<P>
After starting horses in the Kentucky Derby in 1958 and 1960, Whittingham has 
been back to Churchill Downs with horses three times in the 1980s, winning with 
Ferdinand, finishing 12th with Lively One last year and scratching Temperate 
Sil, the winner of the 1987 Santa Anita Derby, when he took ill a week before 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kentucky Derby can take a lot out of a horse, and I don't rush them unless 
they show me they might be able to handle it," Whittingham said. "I've still 
got six 3-year-olds that I haven't even run yet. I'd have to say, though, that 
Sunday Silence is better at the same point in his career than Lively One and 
Temperate Sil were." 
</P>
<P>
Music Merci, who lugged in on jockey Gary Stevens midway through the stretch, 
came to the San Felipe off a nine-length victory in the San Rafael three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this race was a combination of three things," Stevens said. "The 
weight, his last race and the problems he had down the backstretch, when he was 
getting all the dirt from the horse on the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"When they run a race like the last one coming off a (two-month) layoff, it's 
got to do something to them. I got within a length and a half of Sunday Silence 
and thought it was going to be a horse race, then when we straightened out into 
the stretch, I had no horse left. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have confidence in him. If he threw in a clinker, I'm glad it was 
today, and not the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Robbins, who trains Flying Continental, was happy with his horse's race and 
said he would run him in the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they'd run as fast early as they did today," Robbins said. "But 
Charlie's horse was great, especially when you consider that it his first time 
around two turns." 
</P>
<P>
When Whittingham won his first Santa Anita Derby, with Temperate Sil, he had to 
beat only five horses. There may not even be that many in the gate with Sunday 
Silence three weeks from now. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Craig Lewis, who finished third with Music Merci and last with Mountain 
Ghost in the San Felipe Handicap, scratched Runaway Dunaway, his third entry in 
the race. Runaway Dunaway will run next Sunday at Santa Anita and is a 
candidate for the California Derby at Golden Gate Fields on April 22. As for 
Music Merci, Lewis said: "We'll just have to appraise the situation and think 
about it. I wasn't surprised that Yes I'm Blue set the pace he did, because I 
figured he was a horse who was going to get to the lead at any cost." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's ownership is 50% for Arthur Hancock of Paris, Ky., and 25% 
apiece for trainer Charlie Whittingham and Ernest Gaillard, a surgeon from La 
Jolla. Hancock bought the horse privately, broke him at his Kentucky farm and 
then sold half to Whittingham, who sold half of his interest to Gaillard. . . . 
Houston, undefeated in two starts as a 2-year-old, worked five furlongs Sunday 
morning at Santa Anita in a superb 58 4/5 seconds and will be flown to New York 
Wednesday for his 3-year-old debut Saturday in the seven-furlong Bay Shore 
Stakes at Aqueduct.

Storm Predictions tied a track record Sunday while holding on for an upset 
victory in the Tampa Bay Derby at Tampa Bay Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Storm Predictions took the lead turning for home and withstood a late charge by 
With Approval to score a 1 3/4-furlong win in 1:43 4/5 for the 1 1/16-mile 
track. 
</P>
<P>
"The key today was getting him to relax early," said winning jockey Steven 
Gaffalione. "The race couldn't have set up any better if they had written a 
book for us. When I asked him at the half-mile pole, he just took off." 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes Won, the favorite, finished third after taking the lead around the far 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make any real excuses for him," jockey Earlie Fires said. "We had to 
move a little faster than I wanted to leaving the back stretch. . . . But he 
came up empty in the lane and had nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
Storm Predictions paid $19.00, $6.60 and $3.20. With Approval paid $8.20 and 
$4, and Mercedes Won paid $2.60.

MORNING BRIEFING: TO THEM, IT WAS AN ASTRONOMICAL UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you do when you're hurtling through space and want National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. basketball tournament results? 
</P>
<P>
Radio Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery did exactly that last week 
and received a scorelist from Mission Control in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Coats, Discovery commander, did a double take when he noticed that 
Siena had upset Stanford, 80-78. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that a misprint?" Coats asked Mission Control's David Low. 
</P>
<P>
Low, a Stanford graduate, paused and then slowly replied: "As painful as it for 
me to report, that is not a misprint." 
</P>
<P>
Silent partner: Bobby Bonds and George Foster, former teammates on the San 
Francisco Giants, are good friends, but their friendship started on an odd 
note. 
</P>
<P>
When Bonds and Foster roomed together, Foster was silent the first two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Bonds exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to start talking or there's going to be trouble," Bonds told 
Foster. 
</P>
<P>
"For a second, I thought George would choose trouble," he said. "Then he 
smiled, and after that we got along great." 
</P>
<P>
Swim like the dolphins: The Northern Michigan women's swimming team visited the 
Dolphin Research Center in Marathon, Fla., recently. 
</P>
<P>
Did they plan to take lessons from the dolphins? No, but close. 
</P>
<P>
"We are students of propulsion in the water," Coach Ann James said. "Who better 
to learn from than dolphins, the natural experts." 
</P>
<P>
Campaigning for a cabinet post: After enduring an awful season, USC basketball 
Coach George Raveling was asked if he'd retain his job. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be here unless President Bush wants me to help him with 
international inflation," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be interested in being the drug czar. I'd probably leave coaching for 
something as meaningful as that." 
</P>
<P>
By the numbers: When the Pittsburgh Pirates were issuing uniforms in training 
camp, a rookie drew No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
While the equipment man was affixing the number to his hat, the rookie said, "I 
wear 7 1/4." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Nice Guy: Sean Elliott, Arizona All-American forward, was trailed by 
autograph-seekers in Boise, Ida., where the Wildcats played in the West 
Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Some fans even camped out at his hotel. Elliott didn't mind the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a nice guy, I don't bite," he said. "I'd probably have done the same thing 
when I was a kid and the NCAA came to town." 
</P>
<P>
Lute Olson, Arizona coach, wishes Elliott would just say no to the fans. "We 
held the bus up for 20 minutes while he tried to escape," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Doug Moe, Denver Nuggets coach, after his team played poorly in a 
victory over the San Antonio Spurs last week: "They out-awfulled us."

MIKE DOWNEY: ALL IN ALL, A GOOD SEASON FOR UCLA AND ITS NEW COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curses. Heeled again. 
</P>
<P>
Well, what are we to make of UCLA's 88-81 loss Sunday to North Carolina, which 
ended the Bruins' dreams of -- as the saying goes -- Recapturing the Golden 
Era? Did Jim Harrick's baby bears do themselves proud against Dean Smith's Tar 
Heels, or did they -- as another saying goes -- Blow a Golden Opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
Depends on how you look at these things. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, UCLA played well. The Bruins hustled and muscled and had the favored Heels 
right where they wanted them -- down by as many as 10 points. They gave it the 
old college tournament try. 
</P>
<P>
No, UCLA did not play well. The Bruins caught Carolina on a bad day, a day 
without J.R. Reid, and still couldn't come any closer than seven points. 
</P>
<P>
So, what do you say, Bruin boosters? Were you proud of your boys? Or ready to 
toss a brick through the television screen? 
</P>
<P>
Our opinion is: 
</P>
<P>
(Pause for dramatic effect.) 
</P>
<P>
Let's be kind. Let's be gentle. Let's be grateful to the dead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins worked their socks off. They gave what they had. They sent a couple 
of freshmen and a couple of juniors out there to challenge a Tar Heel team 
that, even without that old curfew-breaker J.R. Reid, was stocked with talent 
from Dean Smith's elbow to the last seat on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
What Sunday's game did show was just how far UCLA still has to come. Taking 
Reid away from Carolina is tantamount to taking Hank Gathers away from Loyola 
Marymount. Look at how Illinois fell apart for a few weeks without Kendall 
Gill, and he was just a playmaking guard. Reid is big and powerful. He's the La 
Brea of Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
All UCLA could do was try. The spirit, however, was weaker than the flesh. 
Compared to other top college clubs, the Bruins' front line looks skinny and 
soft. Trevor Wilson, Kevin Walker and Don MacLean worked long and hard to hold 
off North Carolina, but toward the end, the Heels seemed to muscle the ball 
underneath the basket at will. 
</P>
<P>
The play that really put UCLA away is one Harrick might watch a few hundred 
times on the game films, once he has the stomach for it. It is a play that 
might have prevented the Bruins' first-year coach from pulling off the big 
upset and advancing to the Sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute remained when Carolina went into a four-corner offense, 
trying desperately to preserve a three-point lead. For no reason in particular, 
Jeff Lebo took it upon himself to dart toward the basket, driving for a lay-up. 
</P>
<P>
Darrick Martin, the UCLA freshman guard, cut into Lebo's path and planted 
himself. He appeared to be in perfect position to take a charge by Lebo, which 
would have turned the ball over to the Bruins with 44 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
At the last instant, though, senior forward Charles Rochelin came flying from 
nowhere to go for the block. Rochelin fouled Lebo instead. The North Carolina 
guard made one of two free throws, putting four points' distance between his 
team and the Bruins, who now had to score twice. 
</P>
<P>
Turned out they never scored again. 
</P>
<P>
Well, many a tear has to fall, but it's all in the game. You can't blame 
Rochelin for doing his best. Had he blocked Lebo's shot, they would have 
carried him on their shoulders all the way back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
How was UCLA's first season under Harrick? Not bad. There was no conference 
championship, but Arizona and Stanford ranked among the nation's top teams. 
There were few scintillating upsets, but at least there was that funny phantom 
goaltending victory over Louisville. There also was a defeat at Arizona that 
was as lopsided as any UCLA team has ever endured, but the Bruins gave the 
nation's No. 1 team fits at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
High marks, overall. 
</P>
<P>
The only key player Harrick will lose for next season is Richardson, who 
improved steadily throughout his career, but still attempted to do too much -- 
Senior Syndrome, we call it -- with the game on the line against North 
Carolina. Toodle-ooh, Pooh, and thanks for the memories. 
</P>
<P>
The entire starting front line returns, and MacLean should be a stud if he 
either lifts more barbells or eats more often at McDonald's this summer. The 
kid needs some meat on his bones. 
</P>
<P>
As for Martin, the freshman guard who at first was reluctant to play for UCLA, 
he should become better than Richardson in the long run -- and maybe closer to 
sooner than later. Keep an eye on Harrick's Darrick. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, North Carolina and North Carolina State move on, along with two other 
Atlantic Coast Conference teams and four from the Big Ten. It's clear to see 
where college ball's balance of power lies. 
</P>
<P>
As long as UCLA can't win the championship, somebody has to. Who will that 
somebody be? 
</P>
<P>
Arizona or Oklahoma, that's who. 
</P>
<P>
Tell the ACC and Big Ten to bring as many teams as they like. Ain't gonna 
matter.

The International Amateur Boxing Assn. Sunday levied two-year suspensions 
against five judges and referees accused of inefficiency and not officiating in 
accordance with international rules, and five South Korean boxers and officials 
involved in a brawl during the 1988 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen other officials, also accused of not officiating in accordance with 
international rules during the Seoul Games, were suspended from officiating in 
the world amateur boxing championships at Moscow in September, AIBA president 
Anwar Chowdhry of Pakistan said at the governing body's meeting at Nairobi, 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
The five South Koreans were suspended from AIBA events for two years for being 
involved in a brawl in the ring during an Olympic event. 
</P>
<P>
They attacked New Zealand referee Keith Walker after a Korean lost a 4-1 
decision to a Bulgarian. 
</P>
<P>
The organization also denied an appeal by the U.S. Amateur Boxing Federation 
seeking a reversal of a Seoul Olympic gold medal awarded to South Korean Park 
Si Hun in the light middleweight final against Roy Jones.

ANDERSON LEADS INDIANA OVER UTEP, 92-69

<TEXT>
<P>
Freshman Eric Anderson scored 24 points as the Indiana Hoosiers crushed Texas 
El Paso, 92-69, in the second round of the West Regional at Tucson despite 
having three of their starters on the bench for much of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's Bob Knight, coaching his 700th collegiate game, said Anderson's 
first-half shooting was crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed some offense and Eric is the best combination of our inside and 
outside players," Knight said. "We took a bit of a chance . . . but the kid 
really came through for us." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Joe Hillman, one of three starters in early foul trouble, said the 
difference was depth. 
</P>
<P>
"We played awfully well today, especially the first 10 minutes," said Hillman, 
former Glendale Hoover star. "Then we got some guys in foul trouble but the 
guys off the bench did a great job. That might have been the key to the game." 
</P>
<P>
UTEP Coach Don Haskins, a close friend of Knight, said the Hoosiers thoroughly 
outplayed the Miners. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside they had their way. Outside they had their way," Haskins said. "We got 
kicked on the boards. We just got beat in every way. We were never in it. We 
never did anything to make me believe we were in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The eighth-ranked Hoosiers (27-7) will play No. 11 Seton Hall in the West 
Regional semifinals Thursday at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Edwards, who played only 7 1/2 minutes in the first half, finished with 17. 
Todd Jadlow added 14 and Hillman 12. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP (26-7) was led by Tim Hardaway with 20 points. Greg Foster scored 18 and 
reserve Mark McCall 12. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana, which had beaten UTEP by 18 points at Bloomington early in the season, 
took control of the rematch early by scoring the first seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards got his third foul with 12:28 left in the first half and Indiana 
leading, 17-8. But Anderson picked up the Indiana offense with 10 first-half 
points, making five of eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, Jadlow and Hillman spent most of the first half on the bench, but 
Anderson and the Indiana reserves were able to take a 45-31 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers' defense, meanwhile, slowed Hardaway and the Miners' fast tempo 
game to a walk and forced one errant shot after another. 
</P>
<P>
Hardaway, who had scored 31 Friday in the Miners' first-round victory over LSU, 
was three for 10 at halftime. Prince Stewart, the other half of the UTEP 
backcourt that carried the Miners in the final month of the season, finished 
with three points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana outscored the Miners, 14-2, to start the second half, ending any hopes 
of a UTEP comeback. The second of Edwards' consecutive three-pointers made it 
59-33 with 16:27 left. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP shot 42% and was two of 18 from three-point range. Hardaway made two of 
six three-pointers and Stewart missed all six attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 87, Evansville 73 -- The Pirates, seeded third in the West Regional, 
blew all but one point of a 14-point led, then held Evansville scoreless for 
the final 5:06 to win easily. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall (28-6), reaching the round of 16 for the first time, will face 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo said: "We're a confident team. Sometimes that's 
bad. But they don't think they're going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a good job at the end of the game. The 10 minutes before that almost 
killed us." 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall led, 74-60, before Evansville, led by Reed Crafton, ran off 13 
consecutive points to pull within one, 74-73. But a three-pointer by Andrew 
Gaze and a layup by Gerald Greene turned it around for Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught in a situation where we went bad," Carlesimo said. "We had some 
subs in there. We turned the ball over and we got ourselves in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept slipping until we got some of the starters back in there." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates scored 11 straight after leading, 49-41, at halftime, including 
Daryll Walker's three layups and a dunk. The Pirates seemingly had control. But 
Carlesimo knew better. 
</P>
<P>
"They're too good of a team to hold down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With Evansville trailing, 74-60, the Aces' Scott Haffner made a layup and 
Crafton made a three-pointer, then forced a steal to set up a Haffner 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Crafton made another three-pointer and stole the ball again, then made two free 
throws at 5:06 after being intentionally fouled, to pull within one. 
</P>
<P>
Evansville's Scott Shreffler missed a three-point shot, and Seton Hall 
adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them come back too quickly and we got rattled," Carlesimo said. He said 
he told his team during a timeout, "It's a four-minute game now; let's win it." 
</P>
<P>
Gaze made his three-pointer as Seton Hall kept possession after John Morton 
missed two free throws, and Gerald Greene followed with a layup. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't too many teams that let a 19-point lead get away and be hanging 
by your fingernails and come back," Carlesimo said.

CBS JOINS THE UCLA GAME BROADCAST LATE

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the North Carolina State-Iowa game went into double overtime, CBS had 
little chance of catching the start of the UCLA-North Carolina game. But was it 
necessary to miss the first 12 1/2 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
CBS went to a number of commercials and a report on Eddie Sutton quitting as 
Kentucky's coach before switching to the UCLA game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have business obligations," CBS spokeswoman Susan Kerr said in New York. 
"Commercials are sold as pregame spots, and so they must run before we can go 
to game action. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we would have left the North Carolina State-Iowa game, a lot more 
people would have been upset." 
</P>
<P>
A Channel 2 spokeswoman said the station received about two dozen complaints.

NCAA SOUTHEAST REGIONAL AT ATLANTA;

RICE SCORES 36, MICHIGAN BEATS SOUTH ALABAMA

<P>
The common thought running through the Omni early in the second half of 
Sunday's game between Michigan and South Alabama was that the upstart Jaguars 
were about to pull off another upset over another big-name, big-conference 
opponent in the second-round of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Although South Alabama had a six-point lead, 57-51, with 16:06 remaining, and 
the crowd on its side, Michigan's Glen Rice was of a different mind. 
</P>
<P>
"What was in the back of my mind was that I didn't want it to be my last game," 
the Wolverines senior forward said. 
</P>
<P>
As things turned out, Rice made sure that it wasn't. With a game-high 36 
points, Rice led third-seeded Michigan past South Alabama, 91-82. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines advanced to the regional semifinals against North Carolina 
Thursday in Rupp Arena at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
It will mark the third consecutive season that Michigan (26-7) will meet North 
Carolina during the NCAA tournament. The Wolverines were eliminated the last 
two times. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Michigan might not have had made it this far if it wasn't for Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rice kid was unbelievable," said South Alabama Coach Ronnie Arrow, whose 
team had beaten state-rival Alabama Friday. "I've coached some great shooters, 
but he could be one of the best I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who made 16 of 25 shots from the field, brought Michigan back from its 
six-point deficit by scoring 10 of the Wolverine's next 12 points. And it was 
Rice who started a crucial 10-2 run late in the game that eventually sealed the 
victory for the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-footer with 3:06 remaining gave the Wolverines an 80-78 lead. With 
Michigan ahead, 83-80, and 1:30 left, Rice made a three-point shot from the top 
of the key. Rice also had a team-high eight rebounds and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier when you have No. 41 (Rice) as one of your options," said 
Michigan assistant coach Steve Fisher, who is 2-0 since taking over the team 
last week after Bill Frieder, who took a position at Arizona State, was told by 
Athletic Director Bob Schembechler he could no longer coach the team. "We 
wanted to find Glen Rice. We wanted to get him open." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of some massive picks, Rice got open and got the ball. It didn't 
hurt that Rice, at 6-feet-7, had a four-inch height advantage over Junie Lewis, 
who played him whenever the Jaguars were in a man-to-man. 
</P>
<P>
"It was much easier (to shoot)," Rice said. "But our big men were putting some 
body on their smaller guys." 
</P>
<P>
The screens thrown by Michigan, in particular Terry Mills and Mark Hughes, 
enabled Rice some shooting space. 
</P>
<P>
"The more belly up I got, the more Mills came out," said Lewis, who led South 
Alabama with 25 points. "I tried to go through him a couple of times. It hurt 
so much that I started going around him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Arrow: "We were hoping to get their big ones tired by running on them. 
Those guys are so strong that trying to get through them is like trying to get 
through Grand Central." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it looked as if Michigan was going to be run right out of the 
tournament. After taking an early 20-9 lead, the Wolverines watched South 
Alabama go ahead, 26-25. The Jaguars led at the half, 47-44. 
</P>
<P>
But the Wolverines came back behind Rice, and a three-point play by Mills with 
3:17 left put Michigan ahead for good, 83-80. Mills finished with 24 points, 
seven rebounds and five steals.

ACE OF A PLACE; 
</P>
<P>
CHARLIE PASARELL AND TENNIS HAVE BECOME A HOT COMBINATION IN THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

INDIAN WELLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early Sunday morning, long before the final of his tennis tournament was to be 
played on the center court that he dreamed of in the stadium that he built, the 
King Midas of the pro tennis world strolled his grounds and surveyed all that 
he had touched. And behold, it was gold. 
</P>
<P>
His real name is Charlie Pasarell, and he is quite young to be king, only 
recently turned 45. Around here, he is regularly called "the tennis prince of 
the desert." For what he has done with real estate and tennis interest here, a 
better nickname might be "the Desert Fox." 
</P>
<P>
He has a restaurant named for him here, Charlie's. He recently had the title of 
President of Grand Champions Resort Corporation bestowed on him. For all we 
know, he also has his own Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, his recent impact on the men's pro tennis tournament that has been 
played in the desert for 16 years has been heavenly. When he took over its 
direction in 1981, as a former star player in the middle 1960s and an employee 
of Landmark, a real-estate development company, it was a tournament with a 
checkered past. It had been held at Mission Hills, then moved to La Quinta. And 
it seemed to go through sponsors and patrons faster than it did tennis balls. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, when rainstorms hit the desert, the tournament never was completed. 
Dozens noticed. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the roller-coaster history of the tournament prompted one writer, Mark 
Winters of Inside Tennis, to label it The Pat Cash Tournament: "When it was 
good, it was very, very good. But when it was bad, it was awful." 
</P>
<P>
Once Pasarell started getting the knack for this tennis tournament racket, the 
sport began to really bloom in the desert. Ironically, the blooming began in a 
dusty parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Four years ago, Charlie took me out into the parking lot at La Quinta," said 
Gerry Smith, vice-chairman of Newsweek magazine, the current main sponsor of 
Pasarell's tournament. "There really wasn't any place else to put down two 
chairs and spread out plans and blueprints. So there we sat, in the dirt, 
looking at Charlie's dream." 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Pasarell was giving Smith a closer look at his dream, still 
bearing little semblance to reality. 
</P>
<P>
"He took me over to where the stadium is now," Smith said, "and we stood up on 
top of this huge sandpile and he said, 'There's center court.' And he pointed 
off in the distance, to some cement pilings, and he said, 'There's where the 
hotel, Grand Champions, will be.' 
</P>
<P>
"All that I did is have the blind foresight to agree with his vision." 
</P>
<P>
Pasarell's vision included some ugly sights, such as workers going around the 
clock under huge lights for the last three weeks before the hotel opening and 
first tournament in the new stadium three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a war zone," Pasarell said. "They poured the last part of the 
driveway leading into the hotel at 3 a.m. the day it opened. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the hotel and stadium construction project, a complex that Pasarell 
knew was needed if the tournament was to take on increasing stature, cost $100 
million. Of that, $16 million went to build the stadium that now seats 10,500 
and gets raves all over the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, when Miloslav Mecir beat Yannick Noah in an exciting five-set final, it 
marked the third year of play in Pasarell's Palace. The total prize money, 
mostly loose change a few years ago, was $702,500. Mecir got $136,700, the 
equivalent of about one-quarter of a two-bedroom home, without a view, in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's Champions Cup will offer prize money of $1 million and is 
designated as one of a select group of "Championship Series" tournaments. This 
year, 30 of the top 40 players in the world competed here. Next year, it is 
expected to be even more popular. 
</P>
<P>
And all this via the vision of a man named Charles Manuel Pasarell, who grew up 
in Puerto Rico, battled Arthur Ashe for the No. 1 spot on UCLA's tennis team, 
rose to the spot as top player in the United States in 1967 and one of the top 
10 in the world, and, interestingly, has left his playing legacy on the game 
with his participation in two of the longest matches in history, a 6-hour 
23-minute doubles match in 1968 and his famous 5-hour 12-minute match over two 
days with Pancho Gonzales at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
His is a personality of perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
So the Grand Champions is fast becoming a happening, an in-thing for tennis 
fans, so much so that it even inspired some ridiculous hyperbole after the 
Mecir-Noah match. Said one of the corporate types presenting one of the awards 
on center court, "When the history of tennis is written, Grand Champions will 
be its biggest prize." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, sent reporters scrambling to call their offices to see if 
Wimbledon had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Standing nearby when said hyperbole was uttered was Pasarell, who didn't appear 
to be the least bit flustered. He merely smiled, just as he will on the way to 
the bank for years to come.

Though she lost a set for the first time this year, top-seeded Steffi Graf 
rallied to defeat Chris Evert, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, Sunday in the final of a $300,000 
Virginia Slims tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing," said Evert, 34, who was seeded third. "I had a point for 
4-4 in the third set, and I realized she was very beatable today. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you get to 3-3 in the third set, the chances are there. The last few 
games, probably age was a factor. I didn't feel tired, but maybe I lost a step 
or two." 
</P>
<P>
Evert, playing before family and friends at the Polo Club of Boca Raton, won 
the first set by breaking the 19-year-old West German's serve in the seventh 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Graf recovered quickly, taking a 3-0 lead in the second set and going on to 
even the match at one set apiece. 
</P>
<P>
In the third set, the players remained on serve through seven games. In the 
eighth, Evert was serving with a 40-15 lead when she lost four consecutive 
points and the game. In that run, Evert first missed the baseline, then Graf 
whipped a sideline winner to reach deuce and broke service when Evert hit the 
next two into the net. 
</P>
<P>
With a 5-3 lead, Graf held service at love to end the 1-hour 52-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive tournament title for Graf, ranked No. 1 in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with winning but not with the way I was playing," she said. "I 
didn't have the range on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Graf was awarded $60,000, bringing her tournament singles earnings to $295,000 
since January. Evert earned $24,000 as runner-up.

A CHALLENGING GOAL; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER STAR MICHELLE AKERS HAS ABILITY TO BECOME NFL'S FIRST FEMALE PLAYER 
</P>

<P>
The sky was gray and the breeze was cold, the kind of day Grantland Rice wrote 
about -- a good day to launch an era in football. 
</P>
<P>
The kicker stepped into the ball and sent it through the uprights from 31 yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
A high school football player doing his off-season laps paused and did a 
double-take: "Wow! Why don't we have a kicker like that?" 
</P>
<P>
The kicker he was referring to was named Michelle, and if she turns up on a 
National Football League roster one of these years, Grantland Rice will roll 
over in that great press box in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Akers, from the University of Central Florida in Orlando, is arguably 
the best woman soccer player in the country, a four-time All-American, member 
of the U.S. national team and the first woman to receive the Herman Award, as 
well as Adidas and Soccer America magazine player-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the opening of Ben Agajanian's free weekly spring kicking 
clinic at Millikan High School in Long Beach, and Akers flew out so the 
kickers' guru could judge her prospects. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't her idea. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think it's a good idea," she said. "I think a woman can do it." 
</P>
<P>
The idea was Jim Masson's, a Ft. Worth chiropractor who does motivational work 
in the downscale Dunbar district of the city. Masson had heard of girls playing 
high school football and told a football coaching acquaintance, "I think a girl 
can make it in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
"But it will have to be a kicker," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
Masson pursued the notion with Texas Christian University soccer Coach Dave 
Robinson, who told him, "There is just one (woman) who could do it. Her name is 
Michelle Akers." 
</P>
<P>
Masson brought Akers to Ft. Worth to work out with former TCU kicker Bill 
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"She was putting them through the uprights from 50 yards away without a tee -- 
regulation NFL balls," Masson said. "Bill was impressed. (He said,) 'I've never 
seen a woman kick like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Masson, being near Dallas, then learned about Agajanian, who has worked with 
Cowboy kickers for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He said Agajanian's the best," Akers said. "And we figured if he flew me out 
here to work with him, Ben could tell us right away if I had anything going for 
me and we wouldn't be wasting our time." 
</P>
<P>
Before he ever saw Akers, Agajanian said: "If I think she's for real, I'll 
recommend the Cowboys sign her." 
</P>
<P>
But that was before Jerry Jones bought the franchise and brought in Jimmy 
Johnson to replace Tom Landry, leaving Agajanian in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Agajanian said the only difference it makes is that "now I can recommend her to 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The footing at Millikan was terrible that day, with heavy clumps of grass only 
partially covering the bare spots of mud. 
</P>
<P>
Akers kicked with two of Agajanian's proteges, Jim Powers, formerly of Harbor 
College, and David Caylor, formerly of Cal State Long Beach, who have made the 
rounds of NFL tryouts since leaving school. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe how much easier it is on (artificial) turf," Powers said. 
"Check out the leading kickers in the NFL every year. They all play on turf." 
</P>
<P>
Akers warmed up by kicking her first three attempts through from 24 yards, then 
ran off to retrieve the balls. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'No favoritism,' " Agajanian said. 
</P>
<P>
Akers was successful on five of six from 26 yards, but even when she converted 
from 31, Agajanian told her, "Too Tall Jones would have blocked it. Now, how do 
we get more height? Follow through." 
</P>
<P>
She kicked another from 41 yards, slipped in the mud and shanked a second, then 
hit a third straight, high and long. 
</P>
<P>
"Gee," the high school player said. 
</P>
<P>
He was more impressed than Akers. 
</P>
<P>
After the initial test, she went to the sideline, sat down and said, "Ben is 
basically going to tell me, 'You have some talent, but you're going to have to 
work. Come back and see me in six months or whatever.' 
</P>
<P>
"Or he might tell me, 'Michelle, just go play soccer.' " 
</P>
<P>
Akers was close the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget about she's female," Agajanian said. "Most kickers that come with me 
are learning to kick off the ground. It takes a year or two years." 
</P>
<P>
Many good college kickers fail in the NFL because they can't adjust from using 
a two-inch tee to using no tee at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't doubt a bit that off a kicking tee she can kick 50-yard field goals," 
Agajanian said. "She showed me from 40 pretty good. But kicking off the ground 
is a different technique, and she hasn't learned it yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, she hasn't even kicked off a tee. She's never kicked at all. Right now I 
would say she needs at least a year or two years before she should try out." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to Powers and Caylor, Akers seemed to strain from the longer 
distances. 
</P>
<P>
"She needs a little more quickness in her leg and a little more leg power to 
rate with an NFL kicker," Agajanian said. "She needs to keep from leaning 
backwards. She needs to follow through better. She needs a lot of things that 
no one has shown her. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not saying she can't develop. Starting to kick just a couple of months 
ago by herself and doing this well, I'd say she could improve. I'd say she has 
a chance to kick in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Akers, 23, spent her childhood in Santa Clara and attended high school in 
Seattle. She is 5-foot-10 and 150 pounds, slightly under average size for an 
NFL kicker, but she wouldn't be the smallest. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Breech of the Cincinnati Bengals is only 5-6, and he seemed headed for 
Super Bowl stardom until Joe Montana zeroed in to Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
She has been working out with the kickers at Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"They think it's great . . . real supportive. There are some jerks, but only 
one guy has been against it that I've talked to, and once he saw I could kick, 
I guess he got some respect for me. I'm an athlete. I'm used to that." 
</P>
<P>
Playing soccer, she also has taken her lumps -- far more than the average NFL 
kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had two 'scopes on each knee for torn ligaments, torn cartilage," she 
said. "I just knocked out two teeth this season -- bashed into a girl's head. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had stitches in my head here and here, concussions, black eyes. I think I 
had four black eyes this season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up in Santa Clara, I'd be the only girl out there playing 
football. I wanted to play football until my mom got me into soccer, and I 
really didn't think about football again -- never in my wildest dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to put a lot of hours in. I already have a career in soccer . . . two 
coaching jobs in Orlando set up for next year already, and then I have camps. I 
know how to succeed as a soccer player. You can make a lot of money doing that 
-- like you can make a lot of money kicking footballs. 
</P>
<P>
"If I decide to take it seriously, I want to be the best. It's not going to be 
some gimmick because I'm a woman. This has nothing to do with the feminist 
movement. If I decide to put the effort into it, I want to be the best kicker I 
can be." 
</P>
<P>
She may attend one of Agajanian's five-day kicking camps scheduled in Arizona, 
Texas, Tennessee and Thousand Oaks, Calif., in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
Akers said her parents are divorced and somewhat divided on the prospect of 
having their daughter kick in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad is just afraid of me getting hurt, physically," Akers said. "My mom 
said, 'Yeah, that's great. Go for it.' 
</P>
<P>
"You gotta have thick skin. I think I do. Of course, I don't know what I'm 
getting into yet, either."

POLAROID WINS COURT ROUND 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shamrock Holdings' is running out of luck in its takeover bid for Polaroid 
Corp. following a St. Patrick's Day ruling by a Delaware court upholding key 
anti-takeover measures Polaroid is using to fend off the Burbank company. 
</P>
<P>
Both Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and its huge propsed stock 
buyback were ruled legal on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Validation of the ESOP puts about 14% of the company's stock in friendly hands. 
In addition, the stock repurchase plan calls for Polaroid to buy back $1.1 
billion in stock from the public. New investors friendly to management would 
put up $300 million for part of the stock buyback. 
</P>
<P>
Together, these two defenses would put about 30% of the company's stock under 
Polaroid's control. 
</P>
<P>
With another 30% held by individual stockholders who are generally regarded as 
sympathetic to current management, the Shamrock bid seems profoundly 
handicapped. Another 30% is held by institutional investors who analysts say 
are less likely to favor the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock, an investment firm controlled by Roy E. Disney and his family, said 
it would appeal Friday's decision. A hearing has been set for today on 
Shamrock's request for an injunction pending the appeal.

Pizza Boycott: A group of Detroit Tiger baseball fans trying to preserve Tiger 
Stadium called for a boycott of the Domino's Pizza chain owned by Tigers' owner 
Thomas Monaghan. The Tiger Stadium Fan Club said it took the action because of 
Monaghan's support for the construction of a new, open-air stadium. Monaghan 
came out in favor of a new stadium on Thursday, saying it would be in the best 
interest of Tiger fans.

Small Gain in Ad Spending: Spending for newspaper advertising rose 6.1% to an 
estimated $31.2 billion in 1988, the smallest percentage gain in 13 years, the 
Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. said. The increase was less than a 9% rise in 
1987 and was the smallest advance since a 5% gain in the recession year of 
1975. Preliminary estimates indicate that spending for retail advertising, the 
largest category for newspapers, rose 4% to $15.84 billion last year. 
Classified ad spending rose 10.1% to $11.77 billion, and national ad spending 
was up 2.6% to $3.59 billion. Media analysts have blamed the sluggish growth in 
retail ad spending partly on recent consolidation in the retailing business.

Hollywood Park Stake: Thomas W. Gamel reported that he has increased his stake 
in the Hollywood Park to 5.6% from 4% since calling for the resignation of 
Marjorie L. Everett, chairman and chief operating officer, in a Feb. 28 letter 
to stockholders. As reported, Gamel's letter also urged that the Inglewood 
company stop thoroughbred racing at its Hollywood Park track and sell its Los 
Alamitos race track and adjacent property. Everett had rejected Gamel's 
suggestions. Gamel is president of Timpte Industries.

Libbey Sells Stake: Nippon Sheet Glass Co. of Japan has agreed to purchase a 
20% stake in Libbey-Owens-Ford for $235 million. 
</P>
<P>
Libbey, which controls about 29% of the U.S. market for automotive glass, 
signed a $1.6-billion deal with General Motors Corp. in January to supply half 
of the car maker's glass needs in North America over the next five years. 
Libbey is the U.S. subsidiary of the British firm Pilkington. 
</P>
<P>
NSG, Japan's second-largest maker of flat and safety glass, is a major supplier 
to Japanese car makers, Pilkington said. "We feel foreign assemblers in North 
America are more likely to be available to Libbey with this participation," 
said Tony Cove, Pilkington's public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
The British company, the world's second-largest car glass maker, bought a 29.5% 
share of Libbey in 1982. It exchanged the holding for the whole of the 
company's glass-making business four years later. 
</P>
<P>
Libbey and NSG already have joint ventures in car glass factories in the United 
States, Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan. Cove said the deal, expected to be 
completed in a few months, could open markets for Pilkington in Southeast Asia 
and Japan.

Taiwan to Offer Aid: Taiwan is to emerge as a creditor nation this year, using 
its economic muscle to win friends in the Third World and help ease its 
diplomatic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
The first payments from a $1-billion development aid fund will be made in the 
first half of this year, Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said. He said 
$100 million in low-interest loans would be made to Third World nations before 
the end of June. The rest of the fund would be used within three years. 
</P>
<P>
Panama, Costa Rica, Thailand and the Philippines have already applied for loans 
totaling $50 million. Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Paraguay 
and Guatemala are among a list of countries expected to follow suit, Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has become increasingly isolated since it lost its seat in the United 
Nations to Peking in 1971. Only 23 countries now recognize the island's 
Nationalist government.

Venture in Vietnam: Summa Bank of Indonesia is about to become the first 
foreign bank to set up operations in Vietnam since 1975, when the Hanoi-based 
Communist regime took over South Vietnam and foreign businesses withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
Summa will form a joint venture with the Ho Chi Minh City-based Bank for 
Industry and Trade, which was founded in 1987 as Vietnam's first commercial 
bank operating without direct government control. 
</P>
<P>
These developments follow banking reforms introduced by the Communist 
government as part of radical plans launched in 1986 to open up the economy and 
encourage the private sector. New banking regulations are being considered to 
liberalize the internal banking system, and regulations for foreign joint 
ventures have been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
Various foreign banks are discussing different types of operation, although 
there is no sign yet of any of them opening a full branch. Several are just 
sending executives into the country on visits until they see how fast the 
economy can open up. 
</P>

<P>
FROM L.A. TO CAIRO, ARCHITECT CHARLES MOORE SEES A NEED FOR HUMAN-SCALE URBAN 
DESIGN

As the jumbo jet from Cairo descended through the smog toward Los Angeles 
International Airport, architect Charles Moore looked down on the smudgy urban 
sprawl of Los Angeles with mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Delight and despair battled in his mind as the memory of past pleasures were 
clouded by the prospect of future disasters. His bird's-eye view of one of his 
favorite urban landscapes was further darkened by the disturbing images 
haunting him from his Egyptian visit -- images of a city drowning in its own 
population. 
</P>
<P>
How, he wondered, can anyone make sense of the shapeless, regional metropolises 
spawned worldwide in the past few decades? Is there any way an individual can 
create a personal identity in the midst of such vast, shapeless mega-cities? 
Can architecture -- the conscious act of designing individual buildings -- have 
any meaning in the face of overwhelming urban proliferation? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the sense that we're winning," Moore said, on a brief stopover in 
Los Angeles during an unrelenting travel schedule that constantly wafts him 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"Both metropolises are on the edge of incoherence," he said of Cairo and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cairo's situation is more obviously desperate. But Moore said he fears that "in 
both cities, each of which have around 15 million inhabitants, the individual's 
sense of being sunk by the sheer weight of crowds is frighteningly similar." 
</P>
<P>
Architects have done little to stop the decline, Moore said sadly. They have 
failed to create environments that give people a sense of place, of belonging 
in enormous cities like Cairo or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, in his role as the "Godfather of Post-Modernism," Moore 
sounded the warning. 
</P>
<P>
"If architects are to continue to do useful work on this planet, then surely 
their proper concern must be the creation of place," he wrote in a 1967 essay, 
"Plug It in Ramses, and See if It Lights Up: Because We Aren't Going to Keep It 
Unless It Works." 
</P>
<P>
"To make a place is to make a domain that helps people know where they are, and 
by extension, know who they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier essay, Moore had singled out Disneyland for praise as "the 
greatest urban project of the past decades" at a time when the ruling ideology 
of architectural Modernism considered it an abominable fake. 
</P>
<P>
"Disneyland is the real heart of Los Angeles (which) . . . is really a 
collection of theme parks," he wrote in his introduction to an architectural 
guide, "Los Angeles: The City Observed." 
</P>
<P>
Provocative utterances characterize the 63-year-old Post-Modernist guru's 
quick, eccentric mind. His freedom from received ideas made him one of the 
first architects to challenge Modernism at the height of its stylistic 
dominance in the 1960s. Cherubic and twinkly, Moore has been variously 
described as a "bright-eyed Pan" and a "paunchy Lord of Misrule" by equal 
legions of admirers and detractors. 
</P>
<P>
"Charles Moore's buildings seem to me to be filled with instructive parodies," 
said Gerald Allen, who wrote a monograph on Moore. "Comedy, misrule, release 
and clarification characterize his work. It offers the shocking, the rowdy, the 
funny and the eccentric as paths toward some larger comprehension of the world. 
It also offers the revitalizing proposition that the language of architecture 
is rich enough to describe the world fully." 
</P>
<P>
But Moore's optimism about the power of the language of architecture seems less 
bouncy since he survived a triple heart bypass operation last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"My lease on life was reviewed; my contract with mortality was renewed," he 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
His traumatic experience has not lessened his workload. He still teaches two 
semesters at the University of Austin at Texas, and is very involved with his 
four architectural offices in Santa Monica; Westwood; Essex, Conn.; and Austin, 
Tex. He lectures worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the balding putto -- the little boy cherub, as one wit dubbed him -- smiles 
less freely these days. The old irony is undercut with a creeping cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, for example, did not go to Chicago earlier this month to accept the 
prestigious 1989 Topaz Medallion for Excellence in Architectural Education. The 
Topaz citation stated that Moore has been "a brilliant and inspiring force who 
has transformed the character of architectural education in this country." 
</P>
<P>
"In each school where Charles has taught, his mark on the place is indelible," 
a former student said at the Topaz presentation. "It is the mark not of style 
but of courage -- the courage to care, to listen, to challenge, to experiment 
and to build. The courage to be, genuinely, an architect." 
</P>
<P>
Moore replied: "Such encomiums are nice, and I still enjoy teaching, but I 
couldn't be bothered to fly to Chicago. Such public events are too exhausting 
for me now and too predictable." 
</P>
<P>
Moore has taught at major architectural schools over the past four decades, 
including Princeton, Harvard, Yale, the University of California at Berkeley 
and UCLA. He was dean of Yale architecture in the 1960s but retired when the 
student upheavals of the time disrupted the intellectual life of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
At Austin, where he founded the architecture school, he was allowed to write 
his own ticket. He set up a team studio system emphasizing architecture's 
collaborative nature over expression of individual egos. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite way of teaching is to work and travel with a small group of 
students, talking and arguing all the way, to simulate real-life situations as 
closely as possible," he said. "Designers must learn to look at things, to 
listen to people, to learn by observation. Too many architects are too 
individual, they simply don't hear what the society is saying about itself." 
</P>
<P>
Yet few contemporary architects are as individual as Moore. His designs 
include: a 2,300-foot Wonderwall for the 1984 New Orleans Louisiana World 
Exposition, made up of corrugated sheet metal painted with rainbow colors; the 
1978 Piazza d'Italia in New Orleans -- a mock-Classical composition with 
Corinthian columns capped by stainless steel; a Post-Modernist master plan and 
housing project for West Berlin's Tegel Harbor redevelopment -- a riot of 
iconoclastic shapes and colors; and a series of houses in the form of gazebos, 
toy shops, pavilions, mini-villages and micro-temples. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, his major projects are the Beverly Hills and Oceanside 
civic centers, now under construction; the 1983 St. Matthew's Episcopal Church 
in Pacific Palisades; the 1969 University of California, Santa Barbara, faculty 
club; and the 1985 University of California, Irvine, alumni center. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Moore was one of the architectural "all stars" who devised 
the rejected -- and much-lamented -- Grand Avenue master plan for California 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
He made his mark as an architectural iconoclast in the early 1960s with his Sea 
Ranch Condominium. On a wild stretch of grassy coast near the mouth of the 
Russian River north of San Francisco, Sea Ranch "became the most written about, 
most influential American building of its decade," wrote David Littlejohn in 
"Architect: The Life and Work of Charles Moore." 
</P>
<P>
"A strong case could be made that the writings and teachings of Charles Willard 
Moore, and the design projects in which he has been involved, have formed the 
single most important positive influence in shaping new attitudes in 
architectural design in this country in the last 20 years," Littlejohn said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a Michigan-born architect who has lived most of his life in California, 
is a restless bachelor. He has built himself residences in many places, 
including Pebble Beach, Westwood, Essex and Austin. But the condominium he owns 
in Sea Ranch is the place he considers home. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his peripatetic life style and quirky individuality, Moore seeks a 
collaborative design ambiance, based on the teachings of his Princeton mentor 
Louis Kahn, who called it "the area of human agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The UC Irvine Alumni Center's design "not only alludes vaguely to the Spanish 
Colonial architecture characteristic of California but also adapts the facades 
of three 16th-Century chapels by Flaminio Ponzo on the Celian Hill in Rome," 
said architectural historian Robert Stern. "Moore provides a human-scaled 
public space of a kind almost absent from the rest of the Irvine campus." 
</P>
<P>
Moore observed: "I like to devise ways to include as many people as possible in 
the process of design. When we did St. Matthew's, for example, we functioned in 
a series of open workshops to help the rector and his parishioners arrive at 
the images they had about the church -- images which turned out to be very 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
John Davis, vice chairman of the St. Matthew's parish building committee, said: 
"Charles Moore is a master. He listens. The genius part is his ability to see 
the infinite number of solutions proposed and still be creative." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone who collaborates with him finds Moore so likable. Clients 
often complain he is seldom present long enough to give their projects the 
attention they need. 
</P>
<P>
"We hired Charles but we haven't seen him," Davis once griped during the design 
of St. Matthew's. "He should care more, instead of leaving so much to his 
younger associates." 
</P>
<P>
Associate Tina Beebe said in a 1985 interview: "Charles will take up a young 
man and give him his head." Beebe is a graphic artist in the Santa Monica 
office of Moore Ruble Yudell, where her husband, Robert (Buzz) Yudell, is a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought Buzz from Yale and gave him big jobs to run," Tina Beebe said. 
"Buzz is tough. He stood up to this challenge and to Charles' often ruthless 
demands." 
</P>
<P>
But another one of Moore's associates, she said, ended up sweeping the floors 
in one of his offices. "He's a broken boy." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Zuber, Moore's private secretary who works out of the Westwood-based 
Urban Innovations Group that he helped found with the UCLA Graduate School of 
Architecture and Urban Planning, said: "The trouble with Charles is that he 
can't say no to anything. The phone starts ringing beside his bed at 7 a.m., 
and just never stops till midnight, when he leaves it off the hook. His heart 
operation hasn't slowed him down any, so far as I can see." 
</P>
<P>
With a shy smile spiced with self-mockery, Moore observed of himself: "I'm very 
quick at doing things. My mind spins too fast for many people -- which is often 
awkward for my clients, partners and students. I like to have others to argue 
with, though I seldom find minds to match me." 
</P>
<P>
His vision may be darkening but his abiding belief remains fixed on the view 
that architecture ought to help people get a grasp on places where they live, 
work and play to counter the alienation inherent in the increasingly abstract 
urban culture. 
</P>
<P>
"If architecture fails to find that 'area of human agreement,' it's truly 
doomed," he said. "But, as Cairo and Los Angeles illustrate in their separate 
yet similar ways, agreement is getting muffled under the rising roar of 
millions of voices crying out to be heard."

IN PARIS, GIGLI'S HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, Times Fashion Editor 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Runway fashion here is presented as an art form, a grand fantasy of color and 
shape that often predicts the future's reality. 
</P>
<P>
So it did not matter this weekend that Romeo Gigli's models hobbled and minced 
because their gold-lace leggings were tethered to their sandals in a most 
inhibiting way. 
</P>
<P>
His show Saturday still was a howling success because it carried the promise of 
an alternative way for women to dress this fall: sloping shoulders; luminous 
and gauzy fabrics, lightly wrapped and tied around the body; and earthy shades 
such as moss and maroon enlivened with what looked like gold stenciling or 
filigree. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Italian designer's first show in Paris after he burst on to the 
Milan scene just a few seasons back and led a new movement away from 
traditional tailoring. It is partly because of Gigli that broad shoulder pads 
are now passe and a softer tone has been set for women's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
His silhouettes are organic, roughly translating into the outline of an egg, 
gently narrowed at the shoulders and hem. In between, jackets and coats mark 
the waistline gently, if at all; suits have soft but not floppy pants. Velvet, 
silk and shimmery organza swathe the body as if the models had made up their 
outfits themselves from magical bolts of cloth. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation here that Gigli may be starting yet another trend by 
defecting from Milan to Paris for his show, and that the rest of the young 
Italian designers may soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Lacroix showed his more expensive, luxe collection Sunday. He 
provokes feelings of love or hate in everyone who sees his clothes on the 
runway. The high fashion crowd glowed over: the designer's extraordinary, lush, 
Kilim carpet-patterns on skirts and jackets; his unusual use of bright colors; 
and his monumental grasp of that 1950s feeling, along with his sculpted shapes, 
especially on trim little suits with slim, above the knee skirts and curvy 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
The naysayers proclaimed that he piles too much of everything on a single 
outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Paul Gaultier, Claude Montana, Karl Lagerfeld and Issey Miyake were other 
heavy hitters who showed this weekend to roars of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Gaultier dispensed with evening dresses in favor of shiny outfits with cutouts 
and zippers placed where even Frederick's of Hollywood might fear to tread. But 
that was just theatrical frosting on his basic fashion cake. 
</P>
<P>
This Svengali manages to lure about 2,000 people to a suburban sports arena 
each season, where the crowd waits patiently for an hour until the festivities 
begin. This time the audience saw men's tail coats and cutaway jackets 
transposed into elegant women's wool sweaters giving new meaning to the word 
cardigan. Slim jumpsuits had tops shaped like vests, and iridescent taffeta 
evening jackets had long sleeves of lush velvet. 
</P>
<P>
It was a top-oriented show. Much of the time the models wore combinations of 
miniskirts over skinny pants below their long jackets. It also was a leggy 
show, and the leggiest looks of all were Gaultier's rompers. These minuscule, 
puffy, plaid items are doubtless the designer's answer to the shorts now worn 
by Parisian women on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerfeld's show was much applauded but privately panned by many retailers who 
couldn't understand why he too seems to have abandoned the bottom half of 
women's fall fashion. The hotshot designer (whose clothes for Chanel will be 
shown today) actually offered lots of easygoing, ankle-length skirts and 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
His long, slim skirts of pale ottoman rib-knit skimmed the models' figures 
below long, unstructured and unlined matching jackets. Ankle-length, 
side-buttoned jersey skirts were shown with unfitted knit coats. 
</P>
<P>
All that was drowned in a sea of leg-revealing tights, shown with jackets long 
enough to be dresses and dresses short enough to be jackets. In fact, jackets 
were the backbone of his collection -- in black-and-white tweed tent shapes, 
long, equestrian styles with velvet pocket flaps and collars or body-sculpted 
with scooped-out necklines. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Montana didn't follow the rest of the French fashion tack when picking 
his fall colors. Except for a beautiful sky blue, he offered mostly deep, 
offbeat shades of gray, prune, purple and taupe. He showed lots of trousers, 
some slim and cuffed, others with just enough width to look fluid. Above these, 
a variety of beautiful smocked sweater sets, draped long jackets, sporty 
panchoes, capes and coats that were slightly oversized but not droopy. 
</P>
<P>
The new shape here for jackets and coats is called the "peanut" because it is 
indented on the side, at the bosom and arcs out from there to the hipline. It 
is a sculptural marvel and one of many indications this week that designers 
have lost their fascination with the natural waistline and are focusing the 
viewer's eye almost anywhere but there. His signature is a wide collar with a 
long point, and it shows up on almost every outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Issey Miyake's show received a standing ovation, and many in the audience 
rushed backstage to find out how he achieved his evening dresses with shoulders 
sculpted to the outlines of fans, and skirts in equally exotic configurations. 
The answer: He puts permanent, horizontal folds into permanent vertically 
pleated polyester fabric. 
</P>
<P>
His other fall innovations include monotone knit shorts with matching tunic 
tops decorated with puckers; short parkas with fake fur lining; an elegant 
tuxedo suit fashioned out of black stretch knit, and all manner of tail coats 
and short dresses that can be worn back-in-the-front or vice versa.

MADONNA'S PARTY: STARS AND DANCING 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Madonna and a few hundred of her close, personal friends invaded the Park Plaza 
over the weekend as her record label threw a late-night fete to celebrate the 
release of her new album, "Like a Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
Paparazzi staked out the entrance, while inside, guests paid tribute to the 
singer/actress/soft-drink hawker by dancing to her latest single, "Like a 
Prayer." The newly peroxided (and newly single) Madonna showed off her dancing 
skills too, but showed no signs of acquiring stigmata all night. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that part of her new album? Is that?" asked guests, who were trying to 
guess which of the disco-y tunes blasting through the speakers were part of 
Madonna's current repertoire. Most everyone commented on how fabulous she 
looked. 
</P>
<P>
Wandering through the vast, Viking-like rooms of the Plaza were Madonna gal-pal 
Sandra Bernhard (the two were also dance partners); Warren Beatty hanging with 
Lauren Hutton, Beverly D'Angelo and Lori Singer; too-hip modeling agents Omar 
and Paul Fisher; the Hollywood Kids; Dwight Yoakum (almost unrecognizable sans 
cowboy hat); Little Richard; chain mail designer Michael Schmidt; actor Billy 
Wirth; cosmopolitan gadfly Amos Newman; artist and boulevardier Jeffrey Knoll; 
and various record execs, musicians, models and denizens of the night. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of Sean Penn. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. served canapes, make-your-own tacos and an entire table of 
desserts. But why was no one eating? This crowd couldn't have been that 
diet-conscious. Maybe no one wanted to dribble salsa on their leather, the 
preferred fabric of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Agent-types opted for oversized suits and an occasional ponytail, while rockers 
showed off tattoos and nose rings. And let's not forget girls in cut-out minis 
and bustiers, the latter vaguely reminiscent of Maddie in her old days. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, rappers took the stage in one of the rooms, while others 
danced to Madonna songs while watching the new "Like a Prayer" video. Some 
opted to watch the crowd or work it. 
</P>
<P>
And when the party wound down about 1-ish Sunday morning, where did the 
cognoscenti scatter? Why, to b.c., of course, where just the night before 
patrons had danced atop the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hot-hot supper club has only been open a scant few weeks, one girl 
was overheard whining to her friend in the bathroom: "Cynthia, I think this 
place was cooler when no one knew about it, y'know?"

A YOUNGERSOMETHING MOCA BENEFIT SUITABLE FOR FRAMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the twenty- and thirty-something crowd's turn at the charity social 
circuit as the MOCA Contemporaries threw a fashion show fund-raiser at 
Robinson's Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Contemporaries, a young support group for the Museum of Contemporary Art, 
hobnobbed on the home furnishings level of Robinson's while dining on gourmet 
pizza and fajitas. 
</P>
<P>
Even the event planners were surprised at the turnout, more than 500. "A lot of 
people are getting tuned in to the contemporary art scene in Los Angeles," said 
Mark Eshman, founder of the 3-year-old, 250-member group and a stockbroker by 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we were quoted in Newsweek (in a story on young art patrons two years 
ago) we've become the model support group for young people's groups. I get 
calls weekly," Eshman said. 
</P>
<P>
He began the group, he said, because he saw "a void in the community. People 
grow up chasing a buck, and everyone sort of loses sight of giving something 
back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Eshman, there with wife Jill Mazirow Eshman, an attorney, added that he has 
since gotten his parents involved with the museum as well. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporaries president Mindi Horwitch, a development coordinator at Childrens 
Hospital, said that the group consists of art-minded professionals (there is a 
preponderance of accountants and lawyers in the group) who had their first 
party at Helena's, the chi-chi private Silverlake club for celebs and 
cognoscenti. 
</P>
<P>
Seen among the bed linens and deluxe Cuisinarts on Thursday night were MOCA 
director Richard Koshalek, and event co-chairs Sandra Kline and Kathryn Arnold 
and Sue Mettler, wife of Robinson's president and CEO Robert Mettler, who 
couldn't attend the party "because he is literally on an airplane right now," 
Sue Mettler explained. 
</P>
<P>
A fashion show sponsored by Elle magazine was the main draw of the evening -- 
and the reason most of the audience was female. But it wasn't the only draw. 
Guests were invited after the show for dessert and coffee served in women's 
designer wear. And to sweeten the deal, the expendable-income crowd was also 
offered late store hours and a 10% discount on merchandise.

'SLAVE' STYLES INSPIRE A BOUTIQUE

<P>
One not au courant in fashion is hard pressed to say if the threads are 
post-modern, neo-punk, retro or what. But, there they are. In the Slaves of New 
York boutique. It may be the first boutique ever spawned by a movie -- "Slaves 
of New York," starring Bernadette Peters, which opened here Friday and opens in 
Los Angeles on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Tama Janowitz's best-selling 1986 book, the movie, co-produced by 
Ismail Merchant ("A Room With a View"), was called "both an account and an 
example of post-Warholian careerism" by one critic. The short stories that make 
up Janowitz's "Slaves" glimpse into the city's funky, avant-garde art world and 
hot-new-club scene in the East Village and thereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
But how did the movie become "Slaves," the retail adventure? 
</P>
<P>
The boutique officially premiered Tuesday night, as did the movie, the latter 
premiere held in a theater across Third Avenue from Bloomingdale's after a 
cocktail party in the second-floor boutique. 
</P>
<P>
Among the partygoers was Carol Ramsey, stage and film costume designer by 
profession and a key player in the hot new shop, who had the idea of going 
boutique with the movie. Merchant got it under way. 
</P>
<P>
Hired to create the kicky costumes for "Slaves of New York," she had much 
experience, she says, in Baroque and Renaissance styles, "and I tried to 
translate that to contemporary New York." 
</P>
<P>
"I really tried to take what I saw on the streets of New York, especially 
downtown, and the whole art scene, and make it very Baroque-looking, very 
decorative and much more colorful," Ramsey said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to "really push it much more into a fantasy realm, instead of just 
a direct copy of what you see on New York streets." The result: a look she 
described as "very layered, lots of ornamentation, very decorative . . . just a 
lot going on visually." 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds through the filming of "Slaves," she said, she started 
thinking that this look "was something that could be marketed." 
</P>
<P>
She talked about this with Merchant, who is known for films that, like "A Room 
With a View," concern a slower, gentler, turn-of-the-century era when 
well-conducted ladies and gentleman simply did not get down and boogie. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey's thought intrigued him. He called a friend of 22 years, Marvin Traub, 
chairman of Bloomingdale's, and, he said, asked Traub if he'd like to see the 
"Slaves"-in-progress with a view to maybe opening a special "Slaves" room in 
his store. 
</P>
<P>
Traub and seven executives inspected the film. A boutique deal was struck, 
including a second "Slaves" boutique soon at Bloomingdale's in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Ramsey, making her debut in fashion, the design roster included 
Betsey Johnson, Alfredo Villoria and Rachel London. Bloomingdale's has yielded 
all its Third Avenue display windows to wares of the new boutique. 
</P>
<P>
(New York's downtown art world has not been ignored. Artist Kathy Ruttenberg 
struck a deal with Merchant and "Slaves" director James Ivory to open a 
gallery, called The Gallery, with a tie-in to the movie. Its debut program 
says, "The Gallery Inaugural Opening Featuring Artists whose work appeared in 
the Film Slaves of New York." The opening, held Thursday night, saluted 31 such 
artists.) 
</P>
<P>
"Slaves" does not mark the first time a new look in clothing may have been 
touched off by a film, said Merchant, citing the Ralph Lauren safari look that 
emerged after "Out of Africa" and the funny-hat, tie, and baggy-pants look that 
seized many trend-trotting women after "Annie Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Even his own "Room With a View," based on the E.M. Forster novel, spawned sort 
of an Edwardian look in London, France and Italy, he said; there, white dresses 
and white parasols suddenly became the rage. 
</P>
<P>
His next movie, he said, will be "Mr. and Mrs. Bridges," starring Paul Newman 
and Joanne Woodward. Set in Kansas City, it is about 40 years in the lives of a 
married couple who've always lived in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
A boutique possibility there? Merchant laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt it," he said.

U.S. JEWS CAUTIOUS AS PARLEY OPENS IN ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,000 Jewish leaders from around the world have come here to express 
support for Israel, although the numerous American participants are being 
cautious about just what policies they specifically back. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering, known as the Prime Minister's Conference of Jewish Solidarity 
With Israel, begins today. Already, a statement for the close of the conference 
has been drafted and then withdrawn when groups of Americans objected to its 
apparent support of a rigid stand by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir against 
pressure for peace talks, U.S. delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
The conference coincides with increased calls for the Israeli government to 
come up with a peace initiative to lead to a settlement of the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and end the Arab uprising in the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shamir to Speak Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, who is expected to address the conference Tuesday, is scheduled to 
travel to Washington within three weeks to deliver his outline for peace to the 
Bush Administration. The tone and substance of his support in this week's 
solidarity conference is being watched closely here to see how much public 
relations benefit Shamir can round up before his trip. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Shamir has opposed talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization 
or the surrender of occupied land in return for peace -- both of which have 
been tendered by the Bush Administration as possible avenues to a long-sought 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Leading American participants in the solidarity conference are wary of giving 
the appearance of being used as a propaganda tool. They say they do not expect 
to be told what Shamir's peace plan is, nor are they blindly giving approval to 
some future proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Denominator 
</P>
<P>
The Americans insist that they are here to demonstrate something that is not in 
doubt anyway: that the vast majority of American Jews support Israel's basic 
security and economic well-being. Any attempt to enlist them in causes beyond 
this common denominator -- for example, in such messy questions as maintaining 
Israel's control over all the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip or Israel's 
handling of the Arab uprising -- is unwelcome, participants maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to support the people of Israel and to show that American Jews and 
Israel agree on 95% of the issues at hand," said Burton S. Levinson, national 
chairman of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. "We are not here to 
settle on the other 5% that divides us." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the conference is not expected to produce a firm statement on the issues 
of war and peace with the Palestinians or talks with the PLO. Participants also 
insist that this is not a "Conference of Solidarity With the Prime Minister." 
</P>
<P>
"People like myself are not here to endorse the prime minister," Levinson said. 
"We are here to support the people of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blank Check' for Shamir? 
</P>
<P>
Added Wayne L. Feinstein, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles: "There was concern about being seen as giving 
Shamir a blank check. Some American delegations made their worries known. Some 
of us came to make sure this is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
As the conference begins, polls in the United States are showing that American 
Jews are less and less comfortable with Israel's policies in the West Bank and 
Gaza and in favor of some sort of homeland for the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have been upset by what they see as the acquiescence of most 
major American Jewish groups to a U.S. policy move toward including the PLO in 
future peace talks. In a speech given in New York last week, Israeli Foreign 
Minister Moshe Arens said that if Israel's enemies perceive a weakening in 
support either from Washington or American Jewry, "a mortal danger will be 
lurking in the shadows." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delegates Ambivalent 
</P>
<P>
Despite this dark analysis, conference delegates are ambivalent about openly 
entering Israel's partisan debate over the Palestinian issue. Last year, 
then-Foreign Minister Shimon Peres tried to enlist American Jews in his 
campaign to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The effort badly split the influential American Jewish community, and Jewish 
leaders meeting here apparently want to avoid another fray -- at least until 
after Shamir goes to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give the prime minister a chance to be heard," said Seymour Reich, 
head of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. "I 
think that even some critics will withhold their comments until after he meets 
with Bush." 
</P>
<P>
Reich said he expects Shamir to bring some new ideas to Washington that will 
give "forward movement" to the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Even before participants began arriving, controversy developed over the 
conference. American Jews and Jews from other countries complained that the 
invitation list was stacked against those who strongly oppose Shamir's 
policies, which up to now have steadfastly focused on keeping the occupied 
territories under Israeli control.

MOTORCYCLIST KILLED IN COLLISION WITH CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorcyclist was killed on a curving canyon road when he crossed into 
oncoming traffic and collided with a car, the California Highway Patrol said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Randal Ross, 25, of Riverside was fatally injured when he was thrown from his 
motorcycle about 4:40 p.m. Saturday, CHP dispatcher Joe David said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who was wearing a helmet, was traveling about 50 m.p.h. on Modjeska Grade 
Road, east of Santiago Canyon Road, in the hilly area north of O'Neil Regional 
Park. He failed to negotiate a curve and crossed into the eastbound lanes, 
David said. The motorcyclist collided with a 1987 Honda Accord traveling about 
15 m.p.h. that was driven by Henry McFalls, 66, of El Toro, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
McFalls was not injured. The collision is being investigated, David said.

HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
9 PEOPLE RESCUED FROM BOAT AFTER FIRE SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine people were rescued from a 55-foot powerboat off Huntington Beach on 
Sunday after a broken hydraulic line spilled fluid onto a hot turbocharger, 
creating a cloud of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the boat, Dale Anderson, said no fire broke out and no one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
"When they saw all the smoke, they got excited and called the Harbor Patrol," 
said Anderson, who was not aboard. His partner had taken friends out on the 
boat, he said. A Halon fire-extinguishing system dissipated the smoke before 
authorities arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jay Mendez of the Sheriff's Department said the incident occurred about 
11:45 a.m. about a mile from the Santa Ana River jetty, which separates 
Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. Four adults and five children were aboard. 
</P>
<P>
People aboard the sportfishing vessel, The Spoiler, reported a fire when they 
radioed for help, he said. The Harbor Patrol sent boats from Newport Beach and 
Huntington Harbour, and Huntington State Beach dispatched a lifeguard boat, 
Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez said he was told that there was a fire but that it was nearly 
extinguished when the rescue vessels arrived. The Harbor Patrol fire boat 
extinguished the "hot spots," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of damage to the $450,000 vessel was not known, Mendez said.

PEOPLE: WORK ON TSETSE FLY BOOK KEEPS UCI RESEARCHER AWAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It might seem a strange subject for a San Juan Capistrano resident to be 
writing a book about: the deadly tsetse fly, the African creature that gives 
death-dealing sleeping sickness to many of those it bites. 
</P>
<P>
"I've kept a diary of all my experiences in Africa," said Frank Lambrecht, 73, 
who spent most of his life researching insect-borne diseases, including that 
carried by the tsetse fly. Six years ago he decided to settle in San Juan 
Capistrano to write the book. 
</P>
<P>
Currently a research associate at UC Irvine studying South American 
insect-borne diseases, he continues to "love the work" but feels his life's 
work was shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"When a person reaches the age of 60, the World Health Organization feels he no 
longer is qualified to do field work," he said, and disagrees with that stand. 
"I didn't feel 60 years is an unfit age to do that type of work." 
</P>
<P>
The attraction to his life's research remains despite the arduous and sometimes 
dangerous life he had in Africa. In his early recollections, he wrote an 
article titled "Thicket Vignette" that illustrates his difficult life: 
</P>
<P>
"Many times have I squandered hours sitting inside a thicket in the vast 
savanna of the no-man's regions between Rwanda-Burundi and Uganda-Tanzania. The 
afternoons were hot, the air seemed to lack oxygen, insects were crawling 
freely inside my shirt and leggings, perspiration dripping from my brow into my 
eyes, to the great delight of the gnats that gratefully sipped the salty 
moisture." 
</P>
<P>
Lambrecht said he has been bitten many times by the 20 different varieties of 
tsetses, "but I have been lucky. I'm apparently immune to most of them," he 
said, noting that most wild animals in Africa are also immune. 
</P>
<P>
However, domestic animals such as cattle are not immune, and "therein lies one 
of the problems in Africa," he said. "That country has wonderful grazing land, 
but the presence of the tsetse prevents a large part of the grazing land from 
being used." 
</P>
<P>
His adventures in Africa will be documented in the partly scientific and partly 
biographical book called "In the Shade of an Acacia Tree," which will be 
published at year's end by the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
A photography buff, Lambrecht spent much of his free time photographing the 
people of Africa whose tribal life, he said, has not been changed for hundreds 
of years. "I always had a camera in my hands," he said. He recently showed some 
of his photos at a public display in the San Juan Capistrano library. 
</P>
<P>
Lambrecht and his wife, Dora, who have been married for 50 years, decided to 
settle in San Juan Capistrano while he continues to write. Another book 
describing their life in Botswana, a country north of South Africa, is nearing 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
"When I would read my diary, it made me remind myself of all the things I did 
and the experiences I had," he said. "Every day to me was like a new 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
One of these days Noel Trout Jr., 21, of Irvine hopes to become a teacher in an 
inner-city school. 
</P>
<P>
However, Trout was raised in Irvine and knows little about the tough life many 
students live in those environments, so he plans to find out by living in a 
Philadelphia housing project this summer with a family of 10. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will have $8 a week for food and expenses. "I suppose I'll eat a lot 
of pasta and rice," he said. "I have to find out what it's like to live with 
someone who doesn't have anything. " 
</P>
<P>
Trout, who attends San Diego State University, said he has to find out "if I 
can adjust culturally enough to handle something like this. I know in my heart 
I want to help people." 
</P>
<P>
Trout, who ultimately would like to be a missionary, said he needs to live with 
a poor family to understand its plight. "It would be a contradiction to live 
better than the people I want to help," he said. 
</P>

MAN HURT BODYSURFING AT CRYSTAL COVE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man in his 40s who injured his neck and back while bodysurfing at Crystal 
Cove State Park on Sunday was reported in serious condition at Hoag Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's identity, age and residence could not be immediately learned 
"because he was unconscious when he was brought to shore," said a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
According to a County Fire Department spokesman, the man was seen floating and 
obviously injured in the surf about 1 p.m. The accident took place off the 
cliff-lined park, which is between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The man was airlifted to Hoag Hospital by a Marine Corps helicopter.

NOTEBOOK: STILL PRAYING FOR FREEDOM FOR A FRIEND HELD HOSTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NEEDHAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every few months, as I'm half-listening to the radio, I'll hear the words 
"Lebanon . . . hostages," and my heart will start pounding. Maybe this will be 
it, I'll think, maybe now Terry Anderson will be freed, after 4 years of the 
bleakest captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the captors will release a picture of Anderson. It's clearly him, but 
it's not the Anderson I remember. My wife looks at the picture and invariably 
says, "Whenever I think of Terry, I think of him smiling." 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday marked the fourth anniversary of Anderson's life in Beirut as a 
hostage of a Shiite Muslim fundamentalist group known as Hezbollah. Next 
Thursday will be the 10th anniversary of my first meeting with Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
We met in the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan. He worked for the 
Associated Press news agency. I worked for the rival news agency United Press 
International. The agencies battled each other fiercely, and some AP bureau 
chiefs were said to chastise their reporters for fraternizing with the 
opposition after hours. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson wasn't like that. 
</P>
<P>
Days after my wife and I arrived in Japan after 3 1/2 years in India, Anderson 
invited us to see what I still think of as "Terry's Japan." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife lived in Kamakura, an ancient capital of Japan about half an 
hour south of Tokyo by train. It is a graceful old city, dotted with Buddhist 
temples and shady glades that are oases of calm in bustling Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson escorted us from temple to temple, then brought us to his home to meet 
his wife, Miki, his daughter, Gabriela, and the family's two Siamese cats. He 
had met Miki, who is Japanese, while in Japan as a U.S. Marine; her family 
wasn't too happy about her marrying the gaijin, or foreigner, but he felt that 
they eventually made their peace with the match. 
</P>
<P>
I still remember the kindness of Terry and Miki to my wife and myself. Despite 
those years in India, Japan seemed so incredibly foreign to us. It was more 
difficult for us to meet anyone who spoke English than it had been in India. To 
two people suffering a stiff dose of culture shock, the Andersons offered a 
refuge and a glimpse of Japan's pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
Terry and I became friends quickly. We were both directors of the 
correspondents' club and often got together for lunch or a few beers after 
work. We spent a lot of time in South Korea too, reporting on coups and a civil 
uprising there, trying to beat each other's brains out during the day and then 
huddling over dinner to compare how we'd done. 
</P>
<P>
More than once Anderson spoke of his loathing for guns, yet like all of us he 
followed the gunfire because all too often that's where the story was. 
</P>
<P>
He used to talk about switching from the infantry to the public information 
unit while a Marine in Vietnam, figuring that although the switch would force 
him to stay in the country longer it would likely increase his chances of 
living. And he talked of a cousin who was a New York City policeman, whom Terry 
wouldn't let enter his apartment with a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Yet sometimes Anderson did things that weren't quite bright. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1980, opponents of the then-ruler of South Korea, Chun Doo Hwan, took 
over the South Korean city of Kwangju for nearly a week. Anderson and I entered 
Kwangju separately to await the inevitable army counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
It came not long before dawn one morning. I had managed to get a hotel room 
overlooking the provincial headquarters, where the dissidents had their command 
post. As the troops massed, I invited Anderson and a few others up to watch the 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
When we saw soldiers scaling roofs and moving into position, I left the room to 
see if any other reporters wanted ringside seats for the action. As I climbed 
back up the stairs to my room, I heard round after round of automatic weapon 
fire blasting into the hotel and windows shattering. I turned a corner and saw 
Anderson and two other reporters crawling on their hands and knees out of the 
room and down the corridor as fast as they could go. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Anderson had inched up the wall to the window of the room to 
snap off a picture. A soldier on a roof maybe 20 feet away saw him and waved to 
him to get down. Anderson did, but then edged up again and tried to snap off 
another picture. This time the soldier started spraying gunfire into the room 
-- first at head level and then at the level of a man's chest if he was 
kneeling. The bullets ripped through both walls and shattered the furniture in 
the room. Fortunately, Anderson and the others hadn't just knelt down; they had 
dropped to their bellies on the floor, so the bullets went over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
But though the picture of Anderson on his belly sticks in the mind, it is 
overshadowed by remembrances of Terry organizing a wine-tasting party, Terry 
hosting a beach picnic in Kamakura, Terry donning the helmet that gave him the 
look of Darth Vader, hopping on his motorcycle and roaring down to the train 
station for the commute to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Terry left Tokyo more than a year before I did, going first to South Africa and 
then to Beirut, still with the Associated Press. His marriage broke up. He has 
a Lebanese wife now and a daughter he hasn't seen. His father -- whom I 
remember coming to Japan to see a delighted Terry -- died while Terry was a 
hostage. So did his brother. 
</P>
<P>
A bit more than 2 years ago, David P. Jacobsen of Huntington Beach appeared 
before the Orange County Board of Supervisors in Santa Ana to pick up a 
commendation. Jacobsen had been administrator of American University Hospital 
in Beirut when he was taken hostage in May, 1985, and held for 17 months. At 
the time of Jacobsen's appearance, the arms-for-hostages dealings between the 
Reagan Administration and Iran were just starting to come to light. 
</P>
<P>
I spoke to Jacobsen after the ceremony to tell him I was a friend of Anderson 
and wanted to know if he was all right. Jacobsen said he was indeed OK and some 
day would be free. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think Jacobsen thought it would take this long. I know I certainly 
didn't think so. Last week I sent a card to Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who 
has worked tirelessly to remind politicians and ordinary Americans that her 
brother and others are still hostage. 
</P>
<P>
I send these cards several times a year, though I've never met Say. I write 
just about the same message each time: We're praying for Terry and hoping he'll 
be freed soon.

VERSATILE TRACK STAR EXPECTS AN EVENTFUL SEASON AT WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every weekday at 2 p.m., members of Woodbridge High School's track and field 
team begin warming up for their afternoon workout. After a slow jog, light 
stretching, drills and wind sprints, the athletes gather for a quick team 
meeting before dispersing into their particular groups: 
</P>
<P>
Sprinters with sprinters, hurdlers with hurdlers, pole vaulters with pole 
vaulters 
</P>
<P>
And Louie Muniz with Louie Muniz. 
</P>
<P>
Muniz, a sprinter, long jumper, high hurdler, low hurdler and anchor of both 
the Warriors' 400- and 1,600-meter relays, has something of a daily identity 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He knows who he is; he's just not always sure, at track practice anyway, who he 
should be at the particular moment. When his teammates run off to work on their 
particular events, Muniz stands alone, wondering which way to go first. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was cloned, that would be great," Muniz said. "I mean, that would be 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't be too bad for Woodbridge either. Not that the Warriors are in 
desperate need of help. Led by the multitalented Muniz, the team is one of the 
top contenders to win the boys' Southern Section 2-A title this season. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at the Katella Relays, the Warriors won the Division I championship, 
defeating, among others, Orange County powers Santa Ana Valley and Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Muniz's contributions were pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
With a 21-foot long jump, he helped Woodbridge's three-man team win the long 
jump relay. He ran a 50.6 leg to lead the Warriors to a victory in the mile 
relay. He helped Woodbridge tie a school record (43.7) in the 400-meter relay 
and place second. And in the 800 relay, Muniz ran a personal-best anchor split 
of 21.5 to hold off Santa Ana Valley, which finished just a stride behind. 
</P>
<P>
"After my freshman year, people would always say, 'You're going to carry the 
team when you're a senior,' " said Muniz, a four-year varsity member. "I'd just 
say, 'Yeah, sure.' I knew it wouldn't be as easy as that." 
</P>
<P>
Muniz would be the first to admit it hasn't been easy. Doing well in so many 
events has meant much longer practices than the average track and field 
athlete. His usual practice day runs from 2 to 6 p.m., while most of his 
teammates have finished their workouts by 5. 
</P>
<P>
"In practice, I'm always the last one out there at the end of the day," Muniz 
said. "It gets depressing sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's 5 or 6 o'clock and the sun's going down and you're the only one 
around. . . . You see everyone else going home, people are coming home from 
work and you're just sitting there going, 'Hmmm.' " 
</P>
<P>
Does he ever think of giving up the sport? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably every day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Muniz hangs in there because he hopes it will get him reach a goal -- the 
state meet June 2-3 at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get to state this year, just to say I made it," he said. "I also 
want to place in all my four events at the (Southern Section) championships." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Muniz qualified for the Southern Section championships in the long 
jump, 110 and 300 hurdles and 1,600 relay, but he failed to advance to the 
state meet when he placed no better than fifth in any of the events. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I kind of psyched myself out last year," he said. "I started thinking 
that maybe I was doing too much. I think I told myself it was too hard to do 
everything. This year I know that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge Coach George Varvas agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very durable and well-conditioned athlete," Varvas said. "I never worry 
about him. Frankly, he could do a lot more if it were allowed." 
</P>
<P>
Muniz often has been asked whether he would like to pursue the decathlon. But 
at 6-foot-1, 145 pounds, Muniz admits he would have trouble with the strength 
events such as the shotput and discus. 
</P>
<P>
Muniz said he owes much of his success to his family, which supports him in all 
his efforts. It's not surprising, considering the family's connection to track 
and field. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Muniz, a junior, runs the 100 and 200 meters and anchors the 400 and 
1,600 relays for the Woodbridge girls' team. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Muniz, a freshman, is a standout on the Warriors' frosh-soph team. He runs 
both the 110- and 300-meter hurdles, as well as the 400 and 1,600 relays. 
</P>
<P>
And Louie Muniz Sr., is a Woodbridge assistant in his third year of coaching 
hurdlers. He also was an All-Southern Section hurdler for Santa Ana High in 
1963. He went on to help Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago) to two 
consecutive state championships in 1964 and 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I still get butterflies when Louie competes," he said. "It brings back a 
lot of memories." 
</P>
<P>
It also gives the younger Louie a goal, to break his father's best time in the 
high hurdles. Louie Sr. ran 14.3 in high school. His son has run 14.7. 
</P>
<P>
Most agree that if Muniz concentrated on only the hurdles, he would excel even 
further. But, right now anyway, Muniz is content to spread himself thin. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel if I do both hurdles, then everyone can know I have not only speed and 
technique but endurance, too," he said. "And when I do a field event, it shows 
I can do more than just run. And the mile relay, well that's where my team 
comes in. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I say to myself, 'Be serious Louie, you're not a machine! You don't 
have to do all this.' But it's such a challenge, and I like challenges."

LEAGUE CHANGES WILL HAVE TO WAIT; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY PRINCIPALS OVERWHELMINGLY REJECT TWO PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Hamilton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's back to the drawing board after Orange County principals last week 
overwhelmingly defeated two proposals to realign leagues that would have gone 
into effect in the fall of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ryan, Foothill High School principal, chaired a 10-man committee that 
considered nine proposals and selected two to be voted on by county principals. 
</P>
<P>
Among the objections to the proposals were Saddleback remaining in the Sea View 
League, Los Alamitos moving to the Sunset League and Woodbridge moving to the 
South Coast League, sources said. Details of the proposals were not made 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback, with an enrollment of 2,600 students, competes against four schools 
in the Sea View League with enrollments of 1,200 to 1,400 students. Many think 
Saddleback should be placed in the South Coast League, where the average 
enrollment is 2,200 students. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge, with an enrollment of 1,700 students, has dominated the Pacific 
Coast League the past three years, but most think the school is not ready to 
compete in the powerful South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos, with an enrollment of 2,025 students, would be the smallest 
school in the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
The committee decided to reconvene on March 29 after both proposals were 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan is uncertain what action the committee will take at the next meeting, but 
it's a good bet most of the county's leagues will remain intact. But the 
committee will have to make a decision on where to place Century High, a new 
school opening in the fall in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the unsettled business of where Santa Margarita will compete in 
1990. The Southern Section's executive committee recommended that the parochial 
school be grouped in the Catholic Athletic Assn. and placed in a parochial 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita had requested to be placed among the county's public schools 
because it wanted to compete against neighboring schools, but that request was 
denied by the executive committee. The request has been rejected by the 
county's public schools and the Southland's parochial and private schools 
because administrators think Santa Margarita's location would create travel and 
scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Athletic Assn. has appealed to the state level in its bid to 
reject Santa Margarita, but look for the appeal to be denied and the school to 
join the Angelus League in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland leftovers: Southern California boys' and girls' teams claimed State 
Division I basketball titles, but for the most part, Northern California teams 
dominated play in the five divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw of the Los Angeles City Section won its fourth title since 1983 under 
Coach Willie West with an impressive 70-63 victory over Oakland Skyline in 
Division I boys' play. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars went scoreless for nearly three minutes to open the game, but 
showed their explosiveness by scoring 32 points in the second quarter. Crenshaw 
was easily the quickest and deepest team in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside made it three state titles for Southern Section representatives by 
defeating Oakland Fremont for the Division I girls' title. Brea-Olinda girls in 
Division III and Santa Clara boys in Division IV were the other winners for the 
Southern Section, which qualified eight teams for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
But Southern California teams won only four of the 10 titles, although 
Glendora's Tracy Murray stole the show in a losing cause in the Division II 
boys' game. 
</P>
<P>
Murray scored 64 points in an 89-83 loss to Menlo Atherton, tying the Oakland 
Coliseum Arena record set by Rick Barry of the Golden State Warriors in 1975. 
Murray scored 32 of his team's 37 points in the first half and all 28 of 
Glendora's points in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Center Rick Swanwick of Trabuco Hills scored all 25 of the Mustangs' points in 
the second half, which meant Swanwick and Murray accounted for 57 of their 
teams' 62 points in consecutive halves. 
</P>
<P>
And John Paye, a backup quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, made history 
when he led Menlo School to a 52-41 victory over Mission Prep in the Division V 
girls' title game. 
</P>
<P>
Paye became the first to coach a team and play on a team that won state titles. 
Paye was the starting point guard for Menlo School when it defeated Santa 
Clara, 53-51, in the Division II boys' championship game in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate conflict: The state championship was sponsored by Reebok and 
Coca-Cola under the second year of a three-year corporate sponsorship contract, 
but at least one of the state's 10 section commissioners isn't overly thrilled 
with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Thomas, Southern Section commissioner, showed the section's general 
council a copy of a monthly bulletin that prominently displayed basketball star 
Tracy Murray, the state's single-season and career scoring leader. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas told the group his office had received a call from a Reebok 
representative complaining that Murray was wearing a shoe manufactured by a 
rival company. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough is enough," Thomas said. "For 75 years, we (Southern Section) lived 
without Reebok, and we can live without them down the road." 
</P>
<P>
A new look: The National Federation of High School Athletic Assn.'s basketball 
committee has made some revolutionary proposals for the 1989-90 season. Among 
the changes that will be considered include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Replacing four eight-minute quarters with two 18-minute halves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Extending the limit to six personal fouls before a player fouls out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establishing a 45-second shot clock. High school boys' games are the only 
basketball games on any level without a shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requiring all players to wear a protective mouthpiece.

<P>
The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted today to 
approve holding the Renaissance Pleasure Faire this spring in the county's Glen 
Helen Regional Park, 55 miles from downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The event will take place on the 1,425-acre site for seven consecutive weekends 
beginning May 13, organizers said. The park, northwest of the City of San 
Bernardino, is south of the intersection of Interstates 15 and 215. 
</P>
<P>
Forced to find a new location after its longtime site in Agoura was purchased 
by a developer, the Faire had attempted to move to eastern Ventura County. But 
organizers withdrew their application after residents objected to the increased 
traffic the event would bring.

BUSH SAYS HE'S 'PROUD' OF NRA BUT WANTS GUN CURB;

<P>
President Bush today called himself a "proud" member of the National Rifle 
Assn. but said a compromise must be struck on semiautomatic weapons because 
"we're in a very different time now." 
</P>
<P>
"The country needs to know that there is some answer to this. I don't yet know 
what it is," he told a group of women state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Later, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters "clearly 
there's been some evolution of his (Bush's) thinking" on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also voiced White House concerns over reports that NRA officials had 
hinted at political repercussions to national drug control Director William J. 
Bennett if he cracks down too hard on gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a time for threatening people, but time to work together," 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Associated Press last week 
that Bennett had been receiving warnings from the rifle association through 
third parties hinting that the NRA's campaign fund-raising abilities might be 
used against him if he ever sought political office. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said through a spokesman, Don Hamilton, that "there have been a lot of 
phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off." At the time, NRA official 
Wayne LaPierre called the allegations "absolutely ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Bush directed Bennett to review the entire issue of semiautomatic weapons. 
Fitzwater said today that the Administration will take no further action beyond 
last week's banning of the import of semiautomatic weapons until that review is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
In his talk to women legislators, Bush said: "On the NRA, of which I am a 
member, a proud member, I believe we can find an accommodation between the 
legitimate interest of sportsmen and the interests of police chiefs, whose men 
put their lives on the line every day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Different Time' 
</P>
<P>
"We're in very different time now. I am convinced that reasonable men and women 
can work together to find an answer to the problem of these automated weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's comments came against a backdrop of disagreement among senior federal 
officials over how fast and far the government should go in urging gun 
manufacturers to follow the example of Colt Industries Inc. and stop 
non-military sales of semiautomatic assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, John Lawn, urged an end to 
such sales in a TV appearance on Sunday, but drug czar Bennett and Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh advised caution. 
</P>
<P>
The assault rifle issue has become a difficult one for Bush, who opposed 
previous efforts to impose stricter gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
Various law enforcement officials, including Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl 
Gates, who advised Bush during last year's presidential campaign, have come out 
in favor of making it more difficult to obtain assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
The rifles have become popular among illegal drug dealers. Although automatic 
rifles are outlawed, semiautomatic rifles can be purchased in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say semiautomatic rifles easily may be converted to automatic weapons.

Two policemen, one a high-ranking officer in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, 
were found shot to death today near the border with the Irish Republic, 
bringing this year's death toll in Northern Ireland to 26. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the two men were found in County Armagh in an unmarked car only 
yards from the border at the Catholic village of Jonesborough, police said. A 
spokesman at constabulary headquarters said no further details were available. 
He could not explain why the officers, believed to be in civilian clothes, were 
in the area described as "bandit country" by Merlyn Rees, former secretary of 
state for Northern Ireland. He would not confirm if the two dead officers had 
been working undercover.

The State Department said today it is prepared to support the Salvadoran 
government that emerges from Sunday's national election -- but only so long as 
it respects democracy and protects human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman praised the Salvadoran people for having 
braved "violence and terror" by leftist guerrillas who, he said, tried harder 
to disrupt Sunday's balloting than in any other election in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we support the democratic process, that we are prepared 
to support the person who emerges from that democratic process," Redman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship with that new government will depend on its adherence to 
democracy and respect for human rights, the twin pillars of our approach to El 
Salvador." The candidate of the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance party, 
Alfredo Cristiani, has claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Department Sit-In 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 48 people were arrested at a State Department sit-in protesting the 
Salvadoran vote as unfair. 
</P>
<P>
There were still no official results today, but Cristiani told a news 
conference Sunday night that his party was leading with more than 50% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department demonstrators, from a coalition of left-leaning groups 
opposed to U.S. backing of El Salvador's government, arrived at the diplomatic 
entrance shortly after 8 a.m. and presented a protest petition to officials, 
demonstration organizer Ellen Braune told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, several dozen demonstrators linked arms to block the 
entrance and sat down on the front sidewalk, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived with four trucks and began seizing and handcuffing the 
protesters and bundling them into the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested was the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, a once-prominent foe 
of the Vietnam War who heads Sane-Freeze, one of the country's largest peace 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, nine policemen were injured and 122 people were arrested today as 
demonstrators blocked entrances to a federal office building in a protest 
against U.S. policy in El Salvador. The protest was organized by the New York 
Coalition to Stop the War in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
For almost an hour, hundreds of demonstrators blocked entrances to 26 Federal 
Plaza in lower Manhattan, where the FBI and the U.S. immigration authorities 
have their offices. Police said nine officers were injured trying to remove 
demonstrators and that several of the injured officers suffered broken fingers. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has sent $3.5 billion in military and economic aid to the 
government during its nine-year-old war with leftist rebels that has left 
70,000 dead, mostly civilians. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy in El Salvador has been aimed at shoring up a centrist government 
represented by the Christian Democrats and President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who 
is dying of liver cancer and who leaves office June 1. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, 35 people were arrested and others were clubbed this morning 
when a crowd of about 500 people protesting the elections in El Salvador 
scuffled with police outside the Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the crowd chanted, "Stop the War! U.S. Out of El Salvador!," as they 
tried to block entrances to the 20-story building in the city's Civic Center.

A judge today ordered the release of Randall Dale Adams, who was imprisoned for 
12 years for the slaying of a police officer but whose guilt was questioned in 
the film "The Thin Blue Line." 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who was released on a $50,000 personal recognizance bond, had been 
convicted in the 1976 slaying of Dallas Police Officer Robert Wood. Originally 
sentenced to death, Adams' sentence was commuted to life in 1980. His 
conviction was unanimously overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on 
March 1.

DRIVER, 19, GUILTY IN DEATH OF NEWPORT BEACH MOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
STRANGER HAD BOUGHT TRIO LIQUOR

<P>
Rejecting a charge of second-degree murder, an Orange County Superior Court 
jury this morning found Danny David Ornelas, 19, guilty of gross vehicular 
manslaughter while intoxicated in the Sept. 1 death of a Newport Beach mother 
who was standing in an alley with her two children when she was struck by a car 
he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals, had urged the jury to 
convict Ornelas of murder, arguing that the Huntington Park youth deliberately 
swerved the speeding car at Debbie Killelea, 37, as she stood in the alley. 
</P>
<P>
But Ornelas' defense attorney, Ralph Bencangey of Beverly Hills, repeatedly 
told the jury during the three-week trial that the case should be a 
manslaughter trial, not murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Have Received Life 
</P>
<P>
If the jury had convicted Ornelas of second-degree murder, he could have been 
sentenced to up to life in prison. The manslaughter conviction carries a 
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, with eligibility for parole after five. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Luis A. Cardenas ordered Ornelas to be immediately taken into jail 
custody, after the jury gave its verdict at 10:35 a.m. Cardenas set sentencing 
for May 2. Ornelas showed no emotion as he briefly answered the judge's 
questions after the verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
In the courtroom, the youth's parents, Manuel and Blanca Ornelas, held hands as 
the verdict was read by the seven-man, five-woman jury. Blanca Ornelas and her 
daughter, Elizabeth, broke into sobs after the verdict, and the mother had to 
be helped from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family 'Pleased, Grateful' 
</P>
<P>
But the family members later said they are pleased and grateful that the jury 
did not find Danny Ornelas guilty of murder. "I know Danny will be all right," 
said his mother. "God will take care of him." 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Debbie Killelea who had attended the three-week trial in West 
Municipal Court in Westminster displayed no emotion as the verdict was read. 
Later however, Michael Kilfoy of Costa Mesa, Killelea's brother, said the 
family had mixed emotions about the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very sorry for the Ornelas family, but after he serves time in prison, 
at least their family can all be together again," Kilfoy said. "By contrast, 
our family can never be all together again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Measures Demanded 
</P>
<P>
The Ornelas case stemmed from the death of Killelea last Sept. 1. The 
circumstances of her death created a public uproar in Newport Beach, with 
residents demanding more safety measures against young visitors who flood the 
beach area during the warm-weather months. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas and two friends, George Herrera, 20, of Hacienda Heights, and John 
Lozano, then 17, had planned to spend the day at the Wedge area of Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
According to court testimony, the three stopped at a liquor store on the way 
and persuaded a stranger to buy them alcoholic beverages, since they were under 
the legal age. The stranger purchased three 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor and 
a bottle of 151-proof rum for the youths.

order to halt the murder trial of six soldiers charged in the stabbing death of 
a black activist. 
</P>
<P>
It marks the second time in four months that Namibia's highest court has 
overturned a decision by Botha to grant immunity to soldiers accused of murder 
in Namibia, also known as South-West Afria. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel said the soldiers of Namibia's South African-led army will 
have to stand trial for the Nov. 30, 1986, killing of Immanuel Shifidi.

The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by workers at a Southern California 
nuclear power plant who are challenging their employer's random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that threw out, at least 
temporarily, a lawsuit attacking the tests. The justices already are studying 
the validity of drug tests in three other cases. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from tests initiated by Southern California Edison Co. at its 
San Onofre nuclear plant. The tests, modified in December, 1986, require 
randomly selected workers to produce urine samples for laboratory analysis. The 
workers are told the day before they are tested. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was challenged by Local 246 of the Utility Workers Union of America.

Israeli jets bombed Palestinian positions in eastern Lebanon today and 
Muslim-Christian artillery battles spread from Beirut to about 40 outlying 
towns. At least 18 dead were reported nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley, Israeli jets raided positions of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Palestinian sources and 
witnesses said at least 15 guerrillas and civilians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The jets struck in retaliation for a series of guerrilla raids against Israel, 
and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told reporters in Jerusalem, "I believe that 
those who deserved to get it, got it." 
</P>
<P>
The air raids in the Dalhamieh area, near the town of Rayak a few miles from 
the Syrian border and 35 miles east of Beirut, hit the house of a Lebanese 
family who were buried under the rubble, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The jets also hit two Popular Front buildings -- a military vehicle repair 
workshop and a single-story administration compound -- and a building of the 
Marxist Democratic Front. 
</P>
<P>
It was Israel's fourth raid in Lebanon this year. 
</P>
<P>
Security and hospital sources said at least three people were killed and 30 
wounded by Muslim-Christian shelling which rocked mountain towns and coastal 
neighborhoods, spreading panic among civilians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Dead Civilians 
</P>
<P>
The shelling in and around Beirut between Muslim Druze fighters and mainly 
Christian troops of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun was the most intense since last 
Tuesday, when 43 people were killed and 150 wounded, most of them civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources and Red Cross workers said the ferocity of the shelling made 
an accurate casualty figure impossible to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
But they said two people were known to have been killed in Beirut and one in 
the mountains, and predicted the casualty toll would rise. 
</P>
<P>
As the barrage spread, it hit areas which had been spared civil war for more 
than five years. 
</P>
<P>
Shells hit the Khalde junction, south of Beirut, which is a main supply route 
for Syrian troops deployed in West Beirut and thundered in mountain and coastal 
areas over 90 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Druze security sources said the artillery barrages closed the main highway 
linking Beirut to Damascus, but a road through the Shouf mountains to the south 
was still open.

Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady today played down last Friday's 1% rise in 
February wholesale prices, saying that some other economic indicators have 
shown softness recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Some are up, some are down . . . the balance is in the middle right now," 
Brady said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
Brady noted that retail sales and the operating rate of American manufacturing 
industries had both declined in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic right now," he said about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Recent reports have also shown declines in imports and industrial output, 
further indicating a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the rise in wholesale inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve 
to raise interest rates, Brady described Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan as 
competent and said, "I have great confidence in him. He has to do what he has 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed to elaborate, Brady said he is not giving a green light with his 
comments to the Fed to tighten monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration and the Fed have had a running battle over inflation and 
interest rates since President Bush took office. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration for its part must work to reduce the federal budget deficit, 
Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market fell sharply Friday after the Producer Price Index was 
released, but Brady said he was not worried. 
</P>
<P>
"Stock markets go up and down. We'll just have to watch," Brady said.

A British Airways Concorde jet with some well-heeled passengers aboard will 
make the first all-supersonic flight around the world beginning April 1, the 
British airline announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The three-week trip, covering 38,215 miles in a planned total flying time of 35 
hours and 1 minute, could set more than a dozen world speed records, British 
Airways said. The average speed of the supersonic jet will be 1,091.3 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will start in London on April 1 and finish there on April 23. The 
Concorde aircraft, part of British Airways' fleet, has been chartered by 
Lorraine Travel Bureau Inc., a tour operator based in Miami. The fare is 
$39,000 per person based on double occupancy or $40,500 for a single passenger. 
</P>
<P>
The round-trip fare on normal Concorde flights, between New York and London, 
for example, is about $6,400.

Continental Airlines reported no immediate effects on flights today as 
attendants began picketing at airports across the country. 
</P>
<P>
As the Continental strike deadline came this morning, some flight attendants 
set up picket lines at the carrier's main Houston hub, but flights appeared to 
be departing and arriving normally. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 6,800 Continental flight attendants; the company and union give 
differing figures on how many are union members in the largely non-union 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only confirm that the strike has been called," Myra Clayton, spokeswoman 
for the Union of Flight Attendants, said today in Houston. She said the 
decision was made among union leaders Sunday night, but it is not directly 
related to the strike that has all but shut down Eastern Airlines since March 
4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an annual event," Continental spokesman Dave Messing said. An 
Easter, 1988, call for a sickout failed to materialize, and "there's no reason 
to believe this attempt will be any more successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 members of the Union of Flight Attendants, dressed in maroon uniforms 
with Continental emblems, walked a picket line at Houston Intercontinental 
Airport, carrying yellow signs proclaiming "On Strike." 
</P>
<P>
"We were prepared to strike in December and we were promised at the time that 
if we waited the company would be willing to sit down and negotiate a contract 
with us in January, but that still has not happened," Sheila Hammond, one of 
the pickets, said. 
</P>
<P>
There were also pickets reported at Los Angeles International Airport, Newark 
(N.J.) International Airport and Denver's Stapleton International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walked off their jobs 
and how many were picketing on their days off. 
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of problems at airports affected by the 
picketing, or at other airports. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said in a statement that the flights were running normally, "which 
shows that our flight attendants are proud of their service and will continue 
to support the company's goal of providing for the customer."

More than 3,500 public pay telephones located on federal government property 
controlled by the General Services Administration will remain under license to 
local Bell companies and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the GSA said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Austin, acting GSA administrator, said the decision is preliminary 
until GSA conducts a further analysis about licensing a pay phone company. He 
said the GSA's decision will not prevent the agency from selecting a 
long-distance carrier other than AT&amp;T or pay phone companies other than the 
Bell companies at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
GSA's decision was in response to an order in October by U.S. District Judge 
Harold H. Greene under which the owners of premises where Bell pay phones are 
located must decide by April 1 which long-distance carriers to use. If they 
don't make a choice, they will be assigned to a long-distance carrier by 
lottery.

The Pittsburgh Pirates are interested in Seattle Mariners shortstop Rey 
Quinones and are expected to try to arrange a trade, a newspaper reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The National League Pirates are "pursuing a trade for Quinones" and have 
assigned their West Coast scout, Jerry Gardner, to watch the Mariners, the 
Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported, citing an unidentified source close to the 
Pirates. Pirates General Manager Larry Doughty was expected to contact Woody 
Woodward, general manager of the American League Mariners, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard from the Pittsburgh ballclub," Woodward said Sunday night. 
"There are no plans to trade Rey Quinones, but we are willing to listen to 
anyone." Pirates officials asked former Mariners outfielder Glenn Wilson about 
Quinones, and he gave Quinones a high recommendation, the paper reported.

Robert Calicutt, a Richard Petty crewman who was burned during a pit stop 
Sunday in the Motorcraft 500 NASCAR stock car race at Atlanta International 
Raceway, remained in critical condition today at an Augusta hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Calicutt, 35, of High Point, N.C., was burned when gasoline apparently dripped 
onto the tailpipe of Petty's car, bursting into a ball of flame that engulfed 
the crew member. Lisa Rowland, a spokeswoman for the burn center at Humana 
Hospital, said Calicutt is in critical condition, suffering from second- and 
third-degree burns over 25% of his body. She said he could remain hospitalized 
up to seven weeks.

INTERNATIONAL WEIGHTLIFTING FEDERATION ADOPTS DRUG RULES

<P>
The International Weightlifting Federation has agreed on tough new measures 
aimed at stamping out drug use and securing the sport's Olympic future, 
according to an East German official. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist youth daily Junge Welt quoted federation committee member Werner 
Neumann today as saying the organization agreed unanimously on spot doping 
checks in all 131 member countries during training and competitions. 
</P>
<P>
If three lifters of any one country are caught using banned substances in a 
year, the nation will be barred from competitive sport indefinitely and face 
other sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Junge Welt said it is an open secret that more and more people were calling for 
weightlifting to be removed from the Olympics because of the number of athletes 
caught using drugs at the Seoul games last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The (federation) has now countered with tougher measures of control and 
punishment," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The East German ADN news agency said the federation approved the rules at a 
meeting last week in Tenerife.
