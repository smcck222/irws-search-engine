AL MARTINEZ: DOIN' THE HOT LAMBADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The place is jumping like a Joe Carioca cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda Garrison is in the middle of the room, black dress slit to her waist 
and decolletage down to her legal limit, both arms flung out and pelvis thrust 
forward, dancing with a kid who is sweating from more than just physical 
exertion. 
</P>
<P>
She is moving to a pulsating Latin rhythm in a way that contributes to the 
Greenhouse Effect and shouting "feel the beat, feel the beat," as maybe 80 
others dance or practice in front of a wall of mirrors, their behinds swaying 
like palm trees in a Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
They're doing the lambada. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that is to say, they are attempting to do the lambada, because that's 
what everyone who is anyone is doing (right?), and we've all got to be up there 
swaying and thrusting with the rest of them. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the Romans discovered the social nature of an orgy have so many been 
doing the same thing at the same time in the same room. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, they were doing it in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda, a choreographer, and Loreen Arbus, a television producer with an 
unexplainable interest in Latin dances, are offering lessons in the lambada at 
the Landmark Studio. 
</P>
<P>
I dropped by because public eroticism appeals to my sense of recollected evil, 
tapping a memory of youth when something called the dirty boogie was an 
underground hit. 
</P>
<P>
I never did actually dance it because my mother said that if I did I'd go to 
hell, but I had a great time watching and shouting, "Hey, man, that's what I 
crave," which were the words of the song that set us high school studs into a 
primitive frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
The mere memory makes my palms itch. 
</P>
<P>
Not withstanding that faint stirring, I became interested in the lambada 
because, as I said, that's what you all seem to be doing and I don't want you 
doing anything of which I don't approve. Think of me as a kind of hovering, 
celestial presence. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for my afternoon of live lambada, I first saw the movie "Lambada, 
Set the Night on Fire." Trust me when I say it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
It is, briefly, the story of a pretty male high school teacher who says things 
like "Hey, chill out, man," and gets involved with some pretty barrio kids who 
want to, like, make it in the pretty Anglo world by learning trigonometry. 
</P>
<P>
You see it all the time in the barrio, kids tripping out on trig. 
</P>
<P>
Additional dialogue, for those who favor the art form, includes "You're not the 
brightest candle on the cake" and "Let 'em duke it out with their brains." 
Shakespeare couldn't have said it better. 
</P>
<P>
Interwoven through all this for no apparent reason is the dancing of the 
Brazilian-born lambada, during which enough pelvises are rubbed together and 
legs entwined to cause smoke, if not fire. 
</P>
<P>
I hear you say wow, that sounds, you know, erotic, but don't be fooled. Sex and 
vacuity are more feral than sensual, and unless you're turned on by the mating 
call of a bowhead whale, this movie isn't for you. 
</P>
<P>
In the theater at the time were 14 teen-agers, two old ladies, a male pervert 
and me. The film was so unappealing that even the pervert left before it was 
over. I stayed because, well, it's my job. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Hollywood, I am watching Miranda Garrison on the dance floor 
having more fun than an otter on a mud bank, while the kid she's dancing with 
is trying to look cool and not scratch his palms. 
</P>
<P>
I realize the juxtaposition of an otter with a dancer is an uncomfortable union 
of metaphors, but it seems oddly apropos in this case. Use your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The lambada isn't all sexual, but those aspects of it that are can tingle loins 
from Miami Beach to Malibu. At one point my wife, who always accompanies me on 
columns of an erotic nature, looks at me and says, "Close your mouth, you're 
drooling." 
</P>
<P>
I swear to you I never drool, no matter what. She is using that to illustrate 
the degree of attention I bring to a project I am researching for future 
composition. 
</P>
<P>
Neither she nor Miranda see the dance as particularly sexual, though my wife 
will grant the old Tom Lehrer observation, "When properly viewed, everything's 
lewd." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the media that makes it sexual," Miranda says as she cools off outside 
the dance studio. "You'd see more than this at a bar mitzvah. What we interpret 
as nasty is natural in Brazil, even religious." 
</P>
<P>
Miranda advises me to join in. What she says is, "spread your feet, bend your 
knees and hang out." 
</P>
<P>
I am tempted, but my wife reminds me that I have a bad back and no sense of 
rhythm, so I decline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just as well," she says as we leave, "you don't want to end up in hell." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe yes, maybe no.

So the baseball season has been saved, much to the relief of the Dodgers' 
season peanut-holders. 
</P>
<P>
"About a dozen business people prepay me $2 worth a game for peanuts," 
explained celebrity vendor Roger (The Peanut Man) Owens. "Then I always make 
sure to throw to whoever's sitting in their seats." 
</P>
<P>
Owens, whose behind-the-back tosses have won him a scroll from the L.A. City 
Council as well as two guest spots on the Johnny Carson show during his 
32-year-career, wasn't idle during the labor impasse. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been writing a book on my life," said the former Manual Arts High pitcher 
(he threw baseballs, not peanuts, back then). 
</P>
<P>
The tome will tell how he rose from a soda-pop vendor to the more lucrative job 
of peanut hawker in his rookie year with the Dodgers. "Now, because of 
seniority, it takes a minimum of 17 years to graduate to peanuts," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
But, as with the other veterans, the seasons have taken a toll on the Peanut 
Man's body . 
</P>
<P>
"My knees are really starting to bother me," admitted Owens, 47. "My 
orthopedist told me I have to slow down when I go down the stairs in Dodger 
Stadium because I'm putting too much pressure on my joints." 
</P>
<P>
But he has no intentions of hanging up his goobers. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm's fine," he said. "I've never had peanut elbow." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this method also would keep out Medflies: 
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren scared off several swallows attempting to return to San Juan 
Capistrano Monday by throwing stones at them. 
</P>
<P>
You are traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sights and 
sounds but of mind, a journey past a hotel shaped like an Aztec temple, a hot 
dog stand shaped like a pooch, a restaurant with a plane protruding through the 
roof, a hosiery shop topped by a giant leg. 
</P>
<P>
Next stop: The Twilight Zone? 
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of: It's L.A., in the 1930s and '40s. Jim Heimann, co-author of 
"California Crazy," will deliver a travelogue on Southern California's 
eccentric roadside architecture tonight at a dinner hosted by the Art Directors 
Club of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
It's at the Sheraton Grande, a hotel built -- as is the conventional custom 
these days -- in the shape of a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
But you can still come across an occasional blurring of the line between real 
and make-believe in La-La land. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich will present a scroll today to the Magic Mountain 
amusement park for allowing "use of the Roaring Rapids attraction by the County 
Fire Department for swift-water rescue training." 
</P>
<P>
Is there a subtle, cautionary message about the quality of the county's work in 
those signs that mark the sites of construction projects? 
</P>
<P>
"Another Public Works Improvement," says one such notice on 7th Street in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Underneath that announcement, in much bigger letters, the sign warns: 
</P>
<P>
"DRIVE CAREFULLY."

SAN QUENTIN DEATH VIGIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently the passage of laws doesn't mean a thing to some California 
residents. I am referring to the death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
Why those bleeding hearts, who keep a vigil outside San Quentin prison, waste 
their sympathies on the likes of Harris, instead of the families of the 
teen-agers he killed, is beyond my understanding. These people need to put 
themselves in the victims' families shoes, and feel their loss. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' trial was fair, and his sentence well-deserved. Did his victims receive 
a fair trial? 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not these murderer sympathizers agree with the law, they should 
accept it gracefully, because this law is favored by the majority. That is what 
democracy is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, all of those murderers still sitting on Death Row should have their 
sentences carried out at once. Our appeals system is a farce. It wastes 
taxpayer money and protects the guilty. I feel that a limit of two appeals per 
convict would be fair enough.

AND NOW THE SCRAMBLE STARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The impending retirement of Rep. Augustus (Gus) F. Hawkins not only marks the 
end of a long political career but also will provide a major break in a 
frustrating political logjam in Southern California's African American 
community. In a region where election to public office can mean a job for life 
for most politicians, the unexpected vacancy provides an opportunity for 
challenge and change in the local black political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) is, by many accounts, the 
leading candidate in the race to replace Hawkins, an octogenarian who has been 
an admired member of Congress for nearly three decades. Waters is the 
best-known candidate in the largely black and Latino district centered in Watts 
and including South Gate, Huntington Park and part of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
By choosing to run for the Hawkins seat, Waters opened up her 48th Assembly 
District seat, and that's where the real political scramble is taking place. 
Four Democrats have filed to replace Waters, Los Angeles City Councilman Robert 
Farrell among them. Farrell need not relinquish his seat to run for the 
Assembly. If he moves up, however, his council seat -- the Eighth District, 
which represents the predominantly black neighborhoods that stretch south from 
USC -- would be up for grabs. And would-be successors to Farrell are already 
doing their political homework because a missed opportunity may translate into 
a decade of waiting for another chance. 
</P>
<P>
But the significance of the changes that could take place on the South Side 
transcend the ambition of a few political leaders. The rare vacancies -- and 
the prospect of tightly contested races to fill them -- also provide an 
opportunity for fresh debate about the deteriorating social conditions -- about 
drugs, gangs, poverty and not enough housing, education, health care and 
economic growth -- and what can be done to change things. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Hawkins has had a firm grip on his seat since 1962. When he steps down, he 
will leave a praiseworthy legacy of more jobs, better education and greater 
equal opportunity. His early decision not to run again gives black leaders -- 
veterans and newcomers -- a chance to recharge the political debate in their 
community because, finally, there is something to recharge for.

CROSSING THE BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert A. Jones' column "Last One Over the Border, Turn Out the Lights" (Part 
A, Feb. 27) was a cruel, insensitive and misleading look at a daily event which 
is extremely dangerous, technically, illegal, but paradoxically uplifting. 
Jones trivializes the suffering endured by those undocumented workers. Those 
people of both sexes and all ages who risk life and limb so that they and their 
families can escape crushing poverty, were portrayed as "winners" of a "Game" 
in which "the score is about 3 million to zip." Certainly, the tactics used by 
the Border Patrol, such as razor wire and now, blinding light, should not be 
characterized as " . . . something to mix things up a bit and keep the veterans 
interested." Jones forgets that when similar tactics were used near the Berlin 
Wall, no one called it a "Game." 
</P>
<P>
The stakes in this "Game" are higher than Jones cares to admit. Recently other 
media have reported the terrorizing of undocumented workers near the border by 
various vigilante groups. The actions of these groups range from harassment to 
murder, rape and robbery. Fox Television's "The Reporters" (Feb. 24) showed the 
Border Patrol encountering and yet failing to stop a group of ROTC high school 
students near the border. This group was dressed in full camouflage gear and 
armed with paint- pellet guns and BB rifles, out on "patrol" near the border. 
The Border Patrol's inaction amounts to tacit approval of this activity. 
</P>
<P>
Jones ignores these facts, stating, "After all, this is The Game and not to be 
taken too seriously." If murder, rape and robbery are not taken seriously by 
Jones and your newspaper, it is time for all who sympathize with the plight of 
undocumented workers to find other reading material. As always, the 
disenfranchised are powerless against bullies, but we are not.

FIRST STEP TOWARD A NEW LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
NOT UNEXPECTEDLY, EAST GERMANS VOTE THEIR POCKETBOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germans voted themselves as far from communism and as close to Western 
democracy and affluence as they could in Sunday's election. That was no 
surprise, but the margin of victory for Christian Democrats and other 
conservatives was. 
</P>
<P>
The election was only the first step toward a new life for 12.2 million people 
who have spent 40 years as hostages to the Cold War. Unfortunately, the rest of 
the trip will be tougher. 
</P>
<P>
It is an axiom of American politics that people vote their pocketbooks, and 
clearly that is the case for Germans as well. West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, campaigning for the eastern version of his own party, talked directly 
into East German wallets. His message was that his party would not drag its 
feet reunifying a Germany divided since World War II, suggesting that in no 
time at all they would be sharing the material well-being of their Western 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Social Democrats won only one-third more seats in the new East 
German Parliament than Communists, and so it appears that hoped-for affluence 
was not the only motive at work. The vote also put as much distance as possible 
between the voters and 40 years of communist rule that dictated every phase of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
As with many celebrations, there will be hangovers. Kohl, who had other 
stunning good news Sunday with the bad showing of far-right Republican party 
candidates in Bavaria, must move fast to make good on his promises of 
prosperity. Exchanging one high-value West German mark for one low-value East 
German mark may be inflationary. Along with possible inflation, East Germans 
may face unemployment and other setbacks while they work their way out of the 
economic and intellectual dungeon of communism. Lothar de Maiziere, leader of 
East Germany's Christian Democrats and top candidate for prime minister, is a 
human-rights lawyer who fended off Communist efforts to dominate the church. 
But jousting with a government and running one are two very different things 
and non-Communist East Germans have little practice in governance. 
</P>
<P>
The elements of transition that are under their control will be difficult 
enough; much is beyond their control. The rest of Europe remains uneasy about a 
reunited Germany and may try to slow the process down. And how far the Soviet 
Union is willing to go to try to keep a unified Germany out of NATO is 
anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sunday represented two steps forward: Creation of Europe's newest 
democracy and soothing assurances from De Maiziere that Germany can and will 
live within its present borders. The global village could live with one step 
back another day.

HERREMAN MAKES CAPRIATI LOOK 13 IN 6-2, 6-4 VICTORY

<P>
Schoolgirl Jennifer Capriati finally found a test she couldn't pass. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati experienced her first upset as a professional, losing to qualifier 
Nathalie Herreman of France, 6-2, 6-4, in the fourth round of the International 
Players Championships Monday before rain wiped out most of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a lot of errors and she played well," Capriati said. "I think it was a 
pretty good tournament for me. I beat (sixth-seeded Helena) Sukova and made the 
fourth round, and I think that's pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
"(Herreman's) game is different. She'd hit that short slice and then she'd come 
with the topspin. I was getting mixed up with that, the high topspin and the 
slice. I'm going to work on that." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati's record fell to 8-2 since she started her pro career this month. The 
13-year-old played well in her only other loss, to third-ranked Gabriela 
Sabatini in the Virginia Slims of Florida final. 
</P>
<P>
Herreman, combining topspin and sliced groundstrokes, was content to keep the 
ball in play until Capriati made a mistake. The strategy worked, as she 
committed 53 unforced errors to 33 for Herreman. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Herreman, ranked No. 113, advanced to the quarterfinals of a 
tournament for the first time since 1987. Though unheralded, she has been 
playing well, losing only nine games in her previous three matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew exactly how I was going to play her," said Herreman, who scouted 
Capriati. "I used my sliced backhand to her backhand because she didn't like 
it. Against this kind of player you don't give her rhythm. I didn't feel the 
pressure at all." 
</P>
<P>
In men's third-round play, No. 3 seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden swept past Amos 
Mansdorf of Israel, 6-2, 6-1. In suspended matches, top-seeded Ivan Lendl led 
Marcelo Filippini, 6-0, 4-2, and No. 2 Boris Becker led Jean Fleurian, 3-1.

Confusion over the score in the closing seconds helped Penn State defeat 
Maryland, 80-78, in the second round of the National Invitation Tournament at 
State College, Pa., Monday. 
</P>
<P>
With 34 seconds left, Maryland's Jerrod Mustaf sunk what appeared to be a 
game-tying three-point shot and the scoreboard read, 78-78. 
</P>
<P>
The shot was actually ruled a two-point basket, but the scoreboard didn't 
reflect the correct score until 16 seconds remained and Maryland (19-14) didn't 
notice the change for another six seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Terrapins (23-8) fouled Freddie Barnes, who hit two free throws with five 
seconds left.

As Charles Barkley pointed out, the only thing the Philadelphia 76ers lost 
Monday night was a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley took command in the fourth quarter after the 76ers blew all but one of 
a 24-point lead finishing with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists in a 
108-94 victory over the New Jersey Nets at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter how big a lead you lose as long as you win," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the 76ers back into the Atlantic Division lead, one-half game 
ahead of the idle New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia scored 17 consecutive points to build a 39-15 lead in the first 
quarter, but the Nets chipped away and pulled to within 84-82 early in the 
final quarter on a basket by Lester Conner. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets had a chance to tie the score, but Barkley stripped the ball from 
Chris Morris at midcourt and raced in for a resounding dunk that began a 
13-point run. 
</P>
<P>
Hersey Hawkins added 21 points for Philadelphia, and Conner scored 18 and 
Morris had 17 of his 19 in the third quarter for the Nets, who have lost 26 of 
29 games. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 113, Phoenix 102 -- David Robinson scored 34 points and Willie 
Anderson had 12 of his 18 in the fourth period as the Spurs beat the Suns at 
Phoenix, snapping their 19-game home win streak. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Cummings added 23 points and 10 rebounds while Robinson grabbed 14 
rebounds and blocked eight shots for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Johnson scored 36 points for Phoenix, but even his 18 points in the final 
quarter couldn't keep the Suns from having an eight-game winning streak 
snapped. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns were playing without All-Star forward Tom Chambers, who has a strained 
hamstring, and guard Jeff Hornacek, who is recovering from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson and Mark West finished with 18 points apiece for Phoenix, which 
had a 99-97 lead when David Wingate made a layup to start an 11-point surge 
that put the Spurs ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings had two baskets during the spurt while Robinson added a three-point 
play for a 108-97 bulge with 1:39 left. Robinson, who had nine points in the 
fourth quarter, added a three-point play and two free throws in the final 1:19. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 105, Sacramento 97 -- John Stockton had 27 points and 11 assists and Karl 
Malone added 32 points as the Jazz downed the Kings at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz led by as many as 18 points in the third quarter, but the Kings cut 
the deficit to 98-93 when Antoine Carr made two free throws with 1:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
Wayman Tisdale scored 24 points for Sacramento and Danny Ainge added 21. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 117, Atlanta 110 -- Brad Davis made two three-point shots to spark a 
10-point run and Sam Perkins scored 12 points in the fourth quarter as the 
Mavericks turned back the Hawks at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Davis put the Mavericks ahead to stay, 93-92, on a three-pointer with 9:04 
remaining. Over the next 1:50, Roy Tarpley made a field goal, Davis got another 
three-pointer and Perkins scored a basket to make it 100-92. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley had 24 points and 14 rebounds for Dallas. Perkins and Derek Harper 
scored 21 points apiece and Davis had 20. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins had 32 points for Atlanta.

BLACKHAWKS EARN SPOT IN PLAYOFFS

<P>
The Chicago Blackhawks don't have to struggle anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 2-7-2 record in their past 11 games, Monday night's 3-2 victory over 
the Toronto Maple Leafs ensured the Blackhawks of a spot in the Stanley Cup 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We played strong defensively, and that is what we have to do to prepare for 
the playoffs. That was one of our better defensive games," Coach Mike Keenan 
said after Denis Savard scored two goals at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
With six games left, Chicago has 80 points for second place in the Norris 
Division, five more than Toronto and 14 more than Minnesota and Detroit, which 
are tied for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Either the North Stars or Red Wings can finish with the same amount of points 
as Chicago, but the Blackhawks are assured of having more victories than the 
Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
Flames 5, Blues 2 -- Brian MacLellan's power-play goal snapped a tie early in 
the third period and Joe Nieuwendyk scored insurance goals 15 seconds apart at 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Al MacInnis also scored for the Flames, who extended their unbeaten streak to 
8-0-1. Calgary leads the Smythe Division with 92 points, nine more than 
Edmonton, and trails Boston, the overall NHL leader, by a point.

YOUR BODY: THE POUNDS CAN CREEP UP DURING 'DANGER YEARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Are there age-related "danger zones" for weight gain during adulthood? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, suggests a new study that tracked 10,000 adults, ages 25-74, for a decade 
and found weight gain is more likely at certain ages than others. 
</P>
<P>
First, the bad news: 
</P>
<P>
* Major weight gain -- defined in this study as 30 pounds -- occurred most 
often in the 25-to- 34-year-old age group. 
</P>
<P>
* But a subset of test subjects, people who began the study at a normal weight 
and had a major weight gain, were most likely to put on the pounds between the 
ages of 35 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
* Women were twice as likely as men to have a major weight gain. 
</P>
<P>
David F. Williamson, an epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta who led the study, believes that so-called "middle-age 
spread" may begin well before middle age. "Becoming fat and being fat are two 
different phenomena, although people tend to focus on the aftermath," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there's some good news from the study, published in this month's Archives 
of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
* About 40% of the men and 35% of the women maintained their weight within 
about 6.5 pounds, Williamson said. Older people didn't tend to gain weight 
during the study. Less than 1% of subjects ages 65-74 had major weight gains, 
although Williamson speculates some were ill or had poor appetites for other 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
* Weight gain isn't inevitable with age, Williamson believes. "Or at least not 
to the magnitude we've seen." Keeping off excess pounds requires only prudent 
eating and exercise, Williamson said. He suggests nothing more than 45 minutes 
of "purposeful" walking every day. 
</P>
<P>
Other weight control experts say the findings in the federal study mirror their 
own clinical findings about weight gain. "Our clients are primarily females, 
between 25 and 54," said Margaret Kohlberg, a spokeswoman for Weight Watchers' 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Women sometimes develop weight problems after their first pregnancy, said 
Annette Natow, a New York dietitian and weight loss expert who wrote "The Fat 
Attack Plan" (Pocket Books, 1990), a how-to book on trimming fat from the diet. 
"Men gain weight when they assume full-time work." 
</P>
<P>
"Men gain weight due to job stress and 'abuse of lifestyle' behaviors like 
drinking and eating rich desserts," added Dr. David Heber, director of the 
University Obesity Center at the UCLA School of Medicine. "For women, hormonal 
changes are a major cause of weight gain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POINT COUNTERPOINT 
</P>
<P>
The At-Home Pap Test: Is It a Good Option? 
</P>
<P>
Women should undergo a Pap test every one or two years to help detect cervical 
cancer in its early stages, most doctors agree. But many women don't. 
</P>
<P>
The developers of an at-home Pap test say their product, not yet approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration, may make it easier and less embarrassing for 
women to have the test. To complete the home test, women use a douche-like 
device to collect vaginal fluid and then mail a sample to a laboratory for 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Truglio, vice president of Medtech Diagnostics, the Bohemia, N.Y., firm 
developing the MY-PAP, says comparisons of the home test with the traditional 
Pap test have shown the two methods are almost equally accurate. 
</P>
<P>
But there's opposition to the home test, with some doctors saying Pap tests are 
best left in the hands of health-care professionals. Even experienced doctors 
and lab workers can find Pap tests difficult to perform and interpret, they 
point out. 
</P>
<P>
Here are two views: 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. J. S. Wilkenfeld, pathologist, Spring Branch Memorial Hospital, Houston; 
spokesman, College of American Pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only trained health-care professionals should do a Pap smear. It takes a lot 
of experience (to collect the specimen and to interpet it). To get a good 
specimen, you must get cells from the cervix, for instance. If an inexperienced 
person does the Pap, it's a potluck type of test. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Pap is not the only reason for seeing the doctor. The pelvic 
examination by the physician, which accompanies the Pap, is part of a valuable, 
comprehensive exam." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Fred Given, gynecologic oncologist, Norfolk; professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology, Eastern Virginia Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have compared several hundred office Pap tests with the home Pap test. So 
far, we have found the home test just about as accurate as the office test. 
</P>
<P>
"The home test is not a substitute for a pelvic examination. But it's a good 
screening tool for women who won't or don't get an office Pap test. Some women 
say they're just too busy to go in for a Pap. This test will also be a godsend 
in areas where medical care is not easily attainable."

Video Rescues Gym Neophytes 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers at a health club can feel as intimidated as a 98-pound weakling on a 
beach full of bullies. They may feel out of shape, not to mention confused 
about how to operate weight-training machines. 
</P>
<P>
To the rescue comes Beginner's Break, a 35-minute video that gives neophytes a 
head start in the privacy of their own home. 
</P>
<P>
"The tape takes you, beginning to end, through what you will experience in a 
gym," said a spokeswoman for Health for Life, the distributor of the $29.95 
tape. (Information: (800) 523-9983). "It describes how to use most 
weight-training machines, for instance, and what muscle groups each machine 
works," she said. "It's not going to take the place of a personal trainer, but 
it will reduce intimidation for first-time gym-goers." 
</P>
<P>
"The concept sounds good," said Mike Trexler, associate director of continuing 
education for the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. He has two other 
tips for new fitness buffs: 
</P>
<P>
"Go to a reputable fitness center with trainers certified by the Institute or 
the American College of Sports Medicine. Ask a trainer to take you through the 
machines."

ART BUCHWALD: SANCTIONS LEAD TO LOUD CRIES OF FOUL BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no doubt that life is unfair. For many of us, life couldn't be more 
unfair than when the NCAA declared sanctions against Rimshot Tech's basketball 
team. Rimshot Tech, located in the heart of Maryland's low-ball country, had 
one of the most outstanding records of any school in the Hurricane Zelda 
Conference. There was even serious talk of the school going to New Orleans for 
the Jambalaya Playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Teicher, who rides shotgun in our car pool to Rimshot games, said, "You'd 
think that the NCAA Committee on Sports Infractions would have something better 
to do than look for recruiting violations in a university's athletic program." 
</P>
<P>
Chili Kohlmeyer asked, "What's wrong with giving an incoming freshman a small 
BMW if he needs transportation to get to and from practice at night?" 
</P>
<P>
I was in the back seat of the car. "Here's what I think. If the alumni didn't 
give them $600 weekly handouts, the players would go to school in another 
state. All our alumni do when they subsidize a good player is guarantee that he 
won't leave his Mommy and Daddy and go far from home." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Hawke, who was taking it harder than the rest of us, said, "They 
announced that Rimshot couldn't appear on television for two years since the 
school had provided parents of players with free housing at the Trump Tower. 
NCAA action like that only makes it tough on kids who are looking for a good 
education." 
</P>
<P>
Brad added, "They want to put Coach Savory on ice because a couple of players 
shaved points in their last game." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the NCAA's word against the coach's. He didn't see anything, he didn't 
hear anything, and he says that he was making popcorn with a meter maid during 
that particular evening," Chili told us. 
</P>
<P>
I was really mad. "How can anyone have a good basketball team if they're going 
to make a federal case out of every tiny infraction? I haven't heard of one kid 
who was ever corrupted in sports because the school gave him a brand-new 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle." 
</P>
<P>
Brad tried to sound upbeat: "I like the way the president of Rimshot is 
handling this. At the press conference this morning, he announced that the 
school really got a raw deal. He vowed that he would stand by his team no 
matter what penalties were meted out by sanctimonious members of the NCAA. In 
order to make up for the loss of athletic scholarship funds that Rimshot Tech 
had to return, the president said that he was going to give the team the money 
originally set aside for a new science library. Now there's a man who knows his 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"What bothers me is that with all the heat, many high school recruits may 
bypass Rimshot and go to another college that hasn't been caught yet by the 
NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
"No way," I yelled. "There isn't a university with the reputation of Rimshot 
when it comes to basketball perks. We can match any school's recruiting program 
and still have cash in the bank for someone who runs out of 'laundry money.' " 
</P>
<P>
Danny chimed in, "The thing I hate about college sports investigators is that 
they don't give a hoot about the fans. To the schools, we're nothing but warm 
bodies that fill up seats, and buy franks and draft beer. Yet we're the ones 
who support the teams and make sure that the school turns out winners. 
Basketball and football are the keys to a university's reputation in the 
community. The NCAA never cares about the pain they are causing the fans when 
they rap a school's knuckles." 
</P>
<P>
Brad announced: "Let the word go forth to the NCAA that, while we admire their 
efforts to keep sports from corrupting the students, no school of higher 
learning can maintain its scholastic reputation if the viewers aren't able to 
see how well the basketball team is doing on television."

WHY A PRESCRIPTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: It seems that there are more and more drugs that I can buy off the 
shelf that I used to need a prescription for. One is a pill for seasickness. 
</P>
<P>
If I know that I have a problem, and I know the drugstore carries medicine that 
I can buy without a prescription, what would be the point in going to my doctor 
to get a prescription? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The danger in treating yourself with over-the-counter medications is 
that you are not equipped to diagnose your condition. Are you treating yourself 
for the underlying problem or just for a symptom? If you feel some pain, is it 
just a case of heartburn that will soon pass, or is it a symptom of something 
serious that requires medical attention? 
</P>
<P>
I'm not suggesting that you bring every headache to the attention of your 
physician; in most cases, aspirin will be the most effective treatment. But 
don't fall into the habit of treating symptoms with over-the-counter 
medications while possibly ignoring a serious underlying problem.

ERMA BOMBECK: BERMUDA SOCK TRIANGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For as long as there have been washers and dryers, women have been plagued by 
the Bermuda Sock Triangle. For every pair of socks put into the laundry, only 
one is returned. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, I got a grant from the Mental Health Assn. to find out where all 
these socks were going. I talked with mothers who put casts on their children's 
legs, bought black stockings for everyone in the house -- and to one woman who 
told her husband she was conducting a test to see if his "green" leg was less 
tired than his "navy" one at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
We bounced around a lot of theories. Some thought socks were victims of a great 
cosmic force that demanded one be sacrificed like a virgin maiden. Others 
thought socks were reincarnated and appeared in your dryer as bras and panties 
you had never seen before. 
</P>
<P>
They were just speculations. The only person who had a reasonable solution was 
a man who bought two dozen pairs of new socks each year, tore them apart, and 
threw out one sock from each pair to save his wife the trouble of losing them. 
</P>
<P>
Me? I just caved in and told my kids the other sock went to live with Jesus. 
They accepted that. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, I received a package from a woman in Plymouth, Md. "I know you 
have given up on the missing socks," she wrote, "but I just thought you'd be 
interested to know where one of ours went -- one that had been missing a month 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
"On Christmas Eve, I was preparing clam chowder in my Crockpot for company 
dinner. There was a strange odor in my kitchen all afternoon -- not at all 
Christmasy, like evergreen or bayberry candles, but rather putrid. I knew I 
wasn't the world's best cook, but I wasn't that bad either. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was time to serve dinner, we found a sock half-melted between the pot 
and the crockery. I thought of you that evening and wanted you to have it." 
</P>
<P>
A charred-black, brittle piece of fabric fell out of the package. I didn't want 
to look at it. I promised myself 15 years ago that if I didn't stop writing 
about missing socks, I would end up on the pages of the National Enquirer next 
to a spaceship that gave birth. But I couldn't resist. I held the burnt sock up 
to a light and . . . here's the scary part. I have the mate to it.

show, produced by Amblin Television and Universal Television, will premiere in 
first-run syndication beginning January, 1991. In what is being touted as the 
largest commitment ever made to any new network or syndicated program, Fox TV 
stations (including KTTV/Los Angeles) have committed to a three-year weekly 
syndicated run. SHAUNA SNOW

COUNCIL OKS TORREY PINES RESEARCH CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: CAMPUS WINS APPROVAL DESPITE FEARS OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION, AND 
POLLUTION OF THE AIR AND LOS PENASQUITOS LAGOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The San Diego City Council on Monday approved a 56-acre campus on Torrey Pines 
Mesa dedicated to basic genetic research, despite findings by the city staff 
that creation of the facility will significantly contribute to traffic 
congestion, pollute the air and further foul the waters of Los Penasquitos 
Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Citing their desire to promote scientific study that might some day lead to 
major health care advances and a desire to enhance San Diego's reputation as a 
research center, a council majority voted for the La Jolla Pines Technology 
Centre over the objections of the Sierra Club and Councilwoman Abbe 
Wolfsheimer, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It is rare that we get involved in something so important, not only to the 
people of this city, but to so many families," said Councilman Ron Roberts, who 
voted for the project with Mayor Maureen O'Connor and council members Wes 
Pratt, Linda Bernhardt, Bruce Henderson and Judy McCarty despite a Planning 
Department environmental impact report that recommended against it. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen John Hartley and Bob Filner joined Wolfsheimer in opposing the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Situated at the northeast corner of Genessee Avenue and North Torrey Pines 
Road, the research center would be home to the La Jolla Institute for 
Experimental Medicine -- a research arm of a Swedish pharmaceutical company -- 
and major expansions of the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic and the La 
Jolla Cancer Research Foundation. When fully occupied, the 56.4-acre parcel 
will contain 831,000 square feet of scientific research space. 
</P>
<P>
All three organizations will concentrate on "basic life science" research that 
could "identify and characterize the function of genes that regulate cell 
development, whether it's normal cell development, or abnormal cells," such as 
cancers, said R. Douglas Armstrong, vice president of the nonprofit La Jolla 
Cancer Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The results of that research into how specific genes work may some day lead to 
health care applications, but none of the organizations plan direct clinical 
studies, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the value of the research, Wolfsheimer and Hartley nevertheless 
fought another major development atop Torrey Pines Mesa, which Hartley called a 
"natural resource for the whole area." 
</P>
<P>
"The choice is very clear," Wolfsheimer said. "It's between doing something for 
our nation in terms of scientific research and doing something for our city. 
And I think charity begins at home." 
</P>
<P>
According to the environmental impact report, employees at the research campus 
will add 6,653 more auto trips each day to university traffic circulation, 
causing further congestion that would also result in more air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"Urban pollutants," such as oil, rubber, metals, pathogens, trash and other 
solid wastes will wash into Los Penasquitos Lagoon, further harming water 
quality there, according to the report. Some steep hillsides that form the 
natural topography would be graded, the report shows. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts and McCarty said the city cannot zone the area for scientific 
research and then reject developments that seek to take advantage of that 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a scientific research area," McCarty said. "This is what we planned. 
Now to suddenly say, because of traffic and drainage problems, that we are 
going to abandon our entire plan leaves a lot of people incredulous."

STOLEN CAR TRACKING SYSTEM GETS WIDE POLICE TRYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Los Angeles County law enforcement agency but one has signed on to a 
private company's high-tech system for tracing stolen cars, and officials of 
the Massachusetts-based LoJack Corp. say the technology will be available to 
consumers in June. 
</P>
<P>
After an aggressive yearlong marketing effort by LoJack, 48 of 49 local police 
agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol, have agreed to 
participate in the system. 
</P>
<P>
Under the technology, police use computers to track stolen cars that have been 
equipped with homing devices. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Culver City Police Department has declined to take part in LoJack's 
project. Officers there say they are not convinced that homing devices and 
tracking systems will be effective in sprawling, hilly Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Many law enforcement officials say they believe the new technology will not 
only help recover stolen cars but also deter thieves once enough consumers buy 
signal units. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this will be a great step forward. It is a system with a proven track 
record," said Lt. Frederick D. Price of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
However, what remains to be seen is whether consumers will be willing to spend 
the estimated $595 that LoJack charges for the homing devices. The units will 
be sold through used and new car dealers, but must be installed by LoJack 
technicians. 
</P>
<P>
By successfully wooing police departments, the company has virtually cornered 
the market on sales because cruisers will be outfitted with mobile computers 
that track only LoJack units. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack representatives and police in Massachusetts, where the system has 
operated since 1986, say the technology has allowed them to recover about 96% 
of stolen vehicles within 24 hours after thefts are reported. That compares to 
about a 40% recovery rate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts, LoJack has sold more than 35,000 signal units and police have 
found more than 900 stolen vehicles by tracking the homing devices, company 
officials said. Terry Soley, general manager of LoJack's California operations, 
said the company hopes to sell about 20,000 of the devices in the first year of 
the Los Angeles County program. 
</P>
<P>
The system also is operating in two south Florida counties and is to be 
launched in the next few months in New Jersey, Michigan and Illinois, Soley 
said. In California, LoJack wants to expand into San Francisco, Alameda, 
Sacramento and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
But Culver City police say they will hold out in Los Angeles County because 
they remain unconvinced that the cost of equipping cruisers with mobile 
tracking computers is worth the investment at $1,750 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not at all convinced that these things are tamper-proof. I think we all 
know that a seasoned car thief is quickly going to be able to find these 
things, and tear them out. Then the thing will beep away and we will be looking 
in trash barrels," said Capt. Lars Seterling of the Culver City Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Seterling said Culver City officers also were concerned that many car owners 
wouldn't discover thefts for hours, during which time thieves might have left 
the 5- to 20-mile radius tracking area. 
</P>
<P>
Soley said the system has proven effective elsewhere, and thieves likely will 
not find the 7-inch-long transmitters in one of 30 hidden locations where they 
will be installed in cars. 
</P>
<P>
Other police admit they are not sure whether the technology will hold up over 
time, but say the cost of buying mobile tracking computers is not high enough 
to deter them from trying it out. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a little concerned because I understand there are other systems out 
there. We don't want to get our cars loaded down if something better comes 
along," said Lloyd Wood, Azusa chief of police and president of the Los Angeles 
County Police Chiefs Assn. "But LoJack was the first one to come to us." 
</P>
<P>
One competitor, Clifford Electronics Inc. of Chatsworth, filed an antitrust 
claim in Los Angeles Federal Court in April, 1989, contending that LoJack 
unfairly eliminated competition by relentlessly recruiting police departments. 
In January, a judge in Los Angeles dismissed the lawsuit, saying LoJack was not 
engaged in a monopoly because other companies were still free to pursue the 
manufacture and sales of the technology. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Clifford said the company intends to pursue legal action 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the only source for those transponders (homing devices) is LoJack, which 
sells them for $595," said Maxwell Blecher. "My people (at Clifford) said they 
could come into the market for $395 and make a very respectable profit. What 
(LoJack) is going to do is rape people on the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Competitors like Clifford Electronics tried early on to join LoJack in the Los 
Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Clifford lobbied heavily against state legislation that would have 
established a $1-million LoJack pilot program in Los Angeles. At that time, 
Clifford persuaded Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) to add amendments to 
encourage other companies to bid for a contract to implement a similar stolen 
car recovery system. The bill failed when LoJack stopped pushing for passage, 
and the company agreed to provide start-up costs for the system in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, LoJack promised to give the LAPD $1.7 million worth of stationary 
computers, transmitters and mobile tracking computers. To win the Sheriff's 
Department's support, LoJack donated 150 mobile tracking computers. The CHP got 
a donation of 90 of the computers from the company. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, LoJack officials have methodically lobbied smaller police 
forces to join up, arguing that the system would work only if the entire county 
is blanketed by coverage. 
</P>
<P>
To each of the smaller departments, LoJack donated one tracking computer 
apiece. Most then agreed to buy additional computers. In Torrance, for example, 
police plan to purchase nine more tracking computers, and in Santa Monica the 
department plans to buy three. 
</P>
<P>
Signing up police departments before selling the system to consumers is a 
marketing strategy that LoJack officials hope will work to their advantage. 
They argue that LoJack, which researched the technology for 10 years, is at the 
forefront of its development. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles, we recognized it's true that people love their cars and they 
want to protect them. From a business perspective, it is a wonderful 
opportunity for us," Soley said. "If somebody does not like the system, they 
don't have to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Cars outfitted with a $595 homing device -- hidden somewhere in the auto's 
interior -- send out coded signals detected by police with mobile tracking 
computers in their cruisers. When a vehicle is stolen and the owner reports it 
to police, the LoJack Corp. that manufactures the system activates the homing 
device. Any police officer with a mobile tracking computer within a 5- to 
20-mile radius will be able to pick up the signal. The system will not work if 
the stolen car is taken beyond that radius.

PROPOSAL FOR POLICE MUSEUM ENDORSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee has endorsed a proposal by Councilman 
Richard Alatorre that would make a police museum the centerpiece of any 
commercial project built at the site of the old Northeast Police Station in 
Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Public Works Committee has reviewed plans from two private 
developers who proposed apartments, offices and a restaurant in and around the 
historic 1925 police station -- which is no longer in use -- at 6045 York Blvd. 
The committee also heard from a volunteer group that wants to open a police 
museum and youth center on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the volunteer group lacks funding, the committee told city staff 
members and museum organizers to meet with the private developers about making 
the museum a centerpiece of the commercial projects. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members were told to report in 60 days regarding results of the 
negotiations with the developers. The committee will then make a recommendation 
to the City Council, which will make the final decision on the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles Police Sgt. Richard Kalk, president of the Los Angeles Police 
Historical Society, said his group still hopes to win the committee's approval 
to build the museum without the help of developers. Converting the old station 
into a museum is expected to cost $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to show them within the next 60 days that we have the capability of 
raising money," Kalk said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will seek financial help within the Police Department and from 
private foundations. Kalk said he prefers not to join forces with the private 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board feels that if we merge with them, we're going to have to sacrifice 
display areas and the youth center," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, in whose district the station is situated, wants the museum 
organizers to blend their project into one of the commercial proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful idea," said Robin Kramer, Alatorre's chief of staff. "Both of 
the for-profit developers have expressed an interest in accommodating them. The 
question is to what extent." 
</P>
<P>
H.T. Greene and Associates of Los Angeles has proposed a housing and commercial 
project for the site. The Jacmar Companies of Alhambra have proposed a pizza 
restaurant and offices.

LATINOS' PLAN TO TRACE '70 MARCH STIRS OUTCRY; 
</P>
<P>
ANNIVERSARY: SO FAR, PERMISSION FOR THE EVENT HAS BEEN DENIED. OFFICIALS FEAR 
THAT BUSINESSES WOULD BE DISRUPTED.

<P>
Raul Ruiz is an angry man. Give him a moment, and the Chicano studies professor 
at Cal State Northridge will rail against the gross injustices he says Latinos 
have suffered over the years at the hands of the Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Mention the death of newsman Ruben Salazar, who died at an East Los Angeles 
anti-war protest march on Aug. 29, 1970, that turned violent, and Ruiz hits new 
levels of indignation. He is among the many marchers that day who have never 
accepted the verdict of a coroner's inquest that Salazar, a Times columnist and 
news director for Spanish-language television station KMEX, was accidentally 
killed by a tear-gas projectile fired by a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"He was assassinated," said Ruiz, who took photographs outside the Silver 
Dollar bar, not knowing that Salazar had just died inside. 
</P>
<P>
The passions and controversy of that hot, smoggy Saturday afternoon along 
Whittier Boulevard are being recalled as organizers prepare for a march this 
summer to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the protest that attracted 20,000 
marchers and ended in Salazar's death. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles members of the 1990 National Chicano Moratorium Committee have 
petitioned the county for a permit to hold a march for about 10,000 people on 
Saturday, Aug. 25, along the same route the protest followed two decades ago. 
Then they plan to rally at Salazar Park, named after the slain newsman, where 
officers broke up what they said was an unruly crowd bent on violence. That was 
followed by rioting and looting on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The request for this year's march was rejected by the Sheriff's Department 
because of claims that it would disrupt business along the boulevard, 
particularly on a Saturday, and would cost too much to police. Many merchants 
fear a reoccurrence of violence. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors is reviewing the decision and has the power to 
overrule the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The march organizers said their purpose is to mark what some activists and 
historians believe is a significant event in the history of U.S. residents of 
Mexican descent. The 1970 march is believed to have been one of the largest 
gatherings of Chicanos anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, whose bitter columns about the desperate state of Chicanos enraged 
leading politicians of the day, became a martyr of the Chicano movement. 
Numerous parks, public buildings and monuments in Los Angeles and throughout 
the Southwest are named for him. 
</P>
<P>
"We equate Aug. 29 to Cinco de Mayo or Sept. 16 (Mexican Independence Day), but 
it's a more indigenous historic event," said Eastside activist Carlos Montes, 
one of the co-chairmen of the proposed march. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, who was 42 at the time, was one of three people who died during the 
chaotic events that day. More than 200 people were arrested, 60 others were 
injured and $1 million worth of property was damaged. In 1974, Salazar's widow 
received a $700,000 settlement from the county but no admission of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
There is still disagreement over whether sheriff's deputies acted properly that 
day. Many critics, including Ruiz, believe the march was peaceful until 
deputies provoked marchers by their use of tear gas and nightsticks. 
</P>
<P>
That, coupled with the unsatisfying verdict about Salazar's death, Montes said, 
galvanized many disinterested Latinos to support the Chicanos' fight for 
political power and equal opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still fighting for the same things now that they were protesting about 
20 years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the merchants, on the other hand, wish that the proposed march, as well 
as the events 20 years ago, would just go away. 
</P>
<P>
Business plummeted because of the publicity surrounding the violence and the 
lengthy investigations. The customers have since come back, and the merchants 
want to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take the chance for another riot on Whittier Boulevard," said 
James Wenger, president of the 200-member Whittier Boulevard Merchants Assn. 
"No way." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposed march also would disrupt business. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department cited the loss of business as one of the reasons for 
rejection of the parade application. It also cited the disruption of public 
transportation and an estimated cost of $37,000 to pay deputies to patrol the 
event. There was no mention of the possibility of violence in the 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have objection to them having the event," said Sheriff's Sgt. Van 
Morris, who recommended denial of the permit. "But it's difficult to justify 
this for such a small group (the committee). It's questionable whether they 
have general community support." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say they have widespread support. But the merchants and others are 
doubtful, particularly about the projections of as many as 10,000 marchers. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Edmund Edelman, who represents the area, has followed the 
lead of sheriff's officials, who have suggested an alternate parade route to 
ease the concerns of merchants. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the march organizers have resisted any change of route, contending that 
history requires them to march on Whittier Boulevard and, for a few moments, 
stop in silent tribute in front of the bar where Salazar died. 
</P>
<P>
March co-chairman Montes threatens to go to court for permission to march on 
Whittier Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal of the sheriff's rejection has twice come before the county Board of 
Supervisors, but it has been delayed each time while Edelman tries to mediate 
the dispute. The matter is scheduled for reconsideration March 29. 
</P>
<P>
Some on the boulevard are philosophical about the events 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Baiz remembered standing in the doorway of his barber shop and watching 
the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife saw the stuff on TV and called to tell me to come home, but I didn't," 
he recalled. "I think it's OK if they want to have a march. But they have to 
have people there to control things. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't, it's . . . goodby Charlie."

ALATORRE LINKS JAIL, THREAT OF POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a potential water pollution threat, City Councilman Richard Alatorre on 
Monday asked the Environmental Protection Agency to halt expansion of the 
county jail in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Excavation at the site at Vignes and Bauchet streets could disturb toxic and 
carcinogenic substances left behind when a coal-gasification plant at the site 
was shut down half a century ago, Alatorre said. Some excavation already is 
under way at the site but no construction has begun. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre has attacked the expansion plan in the past, charging that the area 
already has too many jails and other lockups. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals, including benzene, pyrene, lead and mercury, are present in the 
soil in high concentrations and already have leached into ground water in the 
area, Alatorre said, citing EPA documents. Continued excavation could cause 
further water contamination and threaten aquifers that provide drinking water 
to 86,000 people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Water and Power officials said Monday that they know of no threat 
to the city's drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the EPA to step in because of the evidence . . . and because of 
the total and complete runaround I have been getting from the county for the 
last two months," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre aides said they have been attempting to get information about 
pollutants from the county for several months, without success. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion site is under investigation by the EPA as a possible Superfund 
site, according to Terry Wilson, a spokesman for the EPA's regional 
headquarters in San Francisco. Such a designation would put the site on a 
priority list for federal cleanup funds. 
</P>
<P>
However, the EPA has not yet found sufficient evidence to warrant an emergency 
shutdown of the expansion project, he said. EPA officials will study a letter 
sent by Alatorre to determine whether any additional evidence has come to light 
that would warrant a shutdown, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
EPA investigators collected ground and water samples from the jail site last 
week, but have not yet analyzed them, he added. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the county Department of Health Services, which is in charge 
of monitoring the site, referred all questions on the matter to the county 
counsel's office. Calls to that office were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the EPA, Alatorre said he has learned that fill material being 
excavated from the site is being sent to recycling centers, where it is 
distributed to the public untested. 
</P>
<P>
He called the situation a "serious and impending threat to public safety," and 
said that workers at the site are not being protected from the pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary test results -- disclosed in a March, 1989, EPA report about the 
land around the abandoned gasification plant -- indicate unacceptably high 
levels of some pollutants, Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
"These findings are of great concern to the city, since ground water at and 
near the . . . site is connected to a system of aquifers which provides 
drinking water to over 86,000 residents," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
But DWP officials said they see no danger. "We don't have any wells in the 
downtown area," said Robert Yoshimura, an assistant water quality engineer. The 
closest wells are about nine miles away, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-DEA AGENT WHO FLED TO EUROPE IS DENIED 
BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former U.S. narcotics agent accused of stealing $150,000 in heroin from the 
Federal Drug Enforcement Administration's vault in Los Angeles and then fleeing 
to Europe after he was indicted on money-laundering and drug-trafficking 
charges was denied bail Monday in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. ordered Darnell Garcia, 43, held 
at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, declaring that 
Garcia's lawyer had failed to rebut government charges that the ex-DEA agent is 
a flight risk and a danger to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who lived in Rancho Palos Verdes, was captured in Luxembourg last July 
and extradited to Los Angeles in late February. He faces six charges, including 
conspiracy, money laundering and revealing secret DEA information. His trial is 
set for Sept. 4.

POLICE REJECT PARTNERSHIP WITH GUARDIAN ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Police Department officials refused Monday to form a partnership with 
the Guardian Angels and told group members that they will be arrested if they 
continue to conduct illegal operations. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had agreed to meet with Guardian Angels representatives after six 
members were detained by police late Thursday night and cited for misdemeanor 
battery and false imprisonment after they attempted to place two men under 
citizen's arrest. But the two men, Melvin Jackson and Thomas Criner, eventually 
placed the Angels under citizen's arrest, police said. The Angels were taken 
into police custody for several hours, cited and ordered to appear in court May 
16. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels presented the police with a "partnership against crime" plan Monday, 
asking the department to recognize and support them as an independent citizen 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Two items in the Angels' five-item proposal, including the possibility of 
creating a police liaison, will be reviewed, said Cmdr. Larry Gore, head of the 
Police Department's public affairs unit, in a news conference after the 
meeting. But a partnership with the Angels will not be established because the 
proposal calls for illegal or inappropriate actions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Angels want police to conduct background checks on Angels 
applicants, Gore said, adding that such activity is illegal. The Angels also 
asked for some training. If that request were granted, the Police Department 
could be held liable for the Angels' actions, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate news conference, Weston Conwell, the Angels' regional director, 
said, "We're not asking for cars or radios, we just want the police to appoint 
a liaison to work with us and let us attend police lineups and sensitivity 
meetings so that officers who arrive on the scene will know who we are." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are just a citizens patrol group with the same rights and 
responsibilities as any other citizen, Gore said, and, if they exceed those 
rights, they will be arrested. They have to abide by our laws. 
</P>
<P>
"They want official sanction by the San Diego Police Department," Gore said. 
"We do recognize them. Weston came with an agenda, and, when he didn't get what 
he wanted, he wasn't satisfied with the meeting."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REFINERY, SEWAGE PLANT FUMES DRAW 
COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Separate releases of strong fumes drew complaints in El Segundo Monday from 
residents and office workers near the Chevron Oil refinery and the city of Los 
Angeles' Hyperion sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Hyperion plant, residents complained in the morning of respiratory 
troubles and eye irritation. 
</P>
<P>
One woman was treated at a Hawthorne medical center. 
</P>
<P>
A plant inspection revealed that a scrubbing device used to remove hydrogen 
sulfide gases had malfunctioned, said Don Goodroe, Hyperion's superintendent of 
operations. But the source of the fumes could not be pinpointed because the 
odor that residents said they smelled had dissipated by the time fire and air 
quality personnel had arrived, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Chevron refinery, a leak of liquid containing foul-smelling sulfur 
compounds drew numerous complaints about 1:30 p.m. from residents and office 
employees up to a quarter-mile downwind, an El Segundo Fire Department official 
said. No medical help was sought.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHERS STAGE SICK-OUT AT 3RD SCHOOL IN 3 
WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compton High School on Monday became the third school in the city in three 
weeks to be hit by a massive teacher absence to protest the lack of a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven of the 68 teachers assigned to the high school called in sick, 
forcing the district to use substitute teachers and administrative staff to 
handle classes, said Elisa L. Sanchez, acting superintendent of the Compton 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley Jones, executive director of the teachers union, placed the number of 
absent at 50 teachers and nine other staff members such as librarians and 
counselors. The Compton Education Assn., which represents the district's 
approximately 1,085 teachers, has insisted that it did not sanction any of the 
work actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they're doing is saying that if the district doesn't want to come 
through contractually we're going to take some action on our own," Jones said 
of the teachers.

DRAIN CLEANER FUMES MAKE 11 SICK, FORCE PARTIAL EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven employees of an optical shop at the Topanga Plaza shopping mall were 
treated for sore throats and dizziness and the mall was partially evacuated 
after fumes from an industrial drain cleaner spread through the business Monday 
morning, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the fumes spread into the Lens Crafters shop after the 
nontoxic drain cleaner was poured into a floor drain in California Pizza 
Kitchen, located above the optical shop at 6600 Topanga Canyon Boulevard in 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the drain cleaner ate through plastic fittings in the drain 
pipe, then saturated a section of a fiber-board ceiling tile, which fell to the 
floor of Lens Crafters. 
</P>
<P>
"When they put this stuff in the drain they didn't read the directions," said 
Marty Kazman, Los Angeles County deputy health officer. "It says right on the 
side of the container that it reacts with plastic." 
</P>
<P>
Fumes filled Lens Crafters through the night and when employees arrived for 
work about 9 a.m., they immediately noticed a chemical odor. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I walked in, it hit me right away," said Paula Legan, an assistant 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real chemical smell," added Terry Riley, also an assistant manager. 
"It smelled like mothballs." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the employees of the shop began to complain of dizziness, nausea 
and scratchy throats. "I started feeling lightheaded and my tongue kind of got 
numb," said Crystal Moore, who works in the optical laboratory, close to where 
the collapsed ceiling tile was found. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Unit was called and the 11 employees 
were taken outside and checked by paramedics. Firefighters closed off the south 
end of the mall but allowed the rest of the shopping center to remain open. The 
Broadway department store, which anchors the south end, was allowed to stay 
open after closing off its doors to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
No fumes were detected in the pizza restaurant but it was also temporarily 
evacuated by firefighters as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Don Mello said none of the employees who complained of illness 
were hospitalized. "All their vital signs were good and we released them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuated areas of the mall reopened about 12:30 p.m. after fumes were 
blown out of the building with Fire Department fans. However, Lens Crafters' 
optical lab remained closed throughout the day and its employees were sent 
home, Riley said. It was expected to reopen today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kazman said the county health department ordered the mall to repair the pipe 
but ordered no other action. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Nellis, a regional director for California Pizza Kitchen Inc., said the 
drain cleaner had been used routinely at the restaurant and had caused no 
previous problems.

PLAN SHIFTS COST OF VENTURA BLVD. WORK TO LANDOWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA and GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city planners proposed Monday that developers of new projects on 
Ventura Boulevard pay a smaller share of the $200-million-plus price tag for 
improving traffic conditions, shifting the balance to existing commercial 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Senior City Planner Bob Sutton said the fees the Planning Department originally 
proposed last month, as part of an overall plan to control growth along Ventura 
Boulevard, had to be sharply revised because they would have faced legal 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The first system called for developers to pay the entire cost of upgrading 
Ventura Boulevard to make it possible for it to handle more traffic without 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
But in a report released Monday, city planners concluded that all property 
owners should bear some financial responsibility for improvements. Sutton said 
the city attorney's office had warned that new developers could only be 
assessed fees to mitigate traffic impacts directly related to their projects. 
</P>
<P>
Business owners frowned on the proposed assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
"We have trouble now collecting rents, and we're not going to be happy at all 
with another assessment," said Hy Termin, who owns the 10-shop Sherman Oaks 
Village Shopping center. "That cost will have to be passed on to our tenants, 
who are already screaming that rents are too high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, said the proposed assessment 
district would not work without a moratorium on all construction. "There still 
needs to be a halt on construction until the funding mechanism for the 
improvements is worked out," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
While some homeowners and property owners along the boulevard pondered the 
plan's revisions Monday, a group of developers and business owners urged City 
Council members and their representatives to adopt the specific plan as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is not perfect, but no plan ever is," said developer Michael 
Zugsmith, who was a member of the citizens advisory committee that drew up the 
original proposal. "But the plan should be approved now. We all have individual 
reservations about the plan, but there are mechanisms to change it once it's in 
place. To delay it any more would be a joke." 
</P>
<P>
The fees to be assessed on developments are a critical element of the Ventura 
Boulevard Specific Plan, which will be reviewed by the city's Planning 
Commission on Thursday. The plan also must be considered by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Planning officials also recommended a revision that would exempt developers 
from paying the traffic impact fees if they build pedestrian-oriented retail 
stores on the ground floors of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton said the revision was prompted by homeowners who want to encourage 
neighborhood businesses. They had complained that the heavy fees proposed in 
the earlier version of the specific plan would make neighborhood-oriented 
retail developments economically unfeasible and would lead to even greater 
pressure to build office projects. The plan would establish a ceiling of 8.6 
million square feet of additional commercial construction along the San 
Fernando Valley's major artery. That much new development would produce about 
30,000 extra auto trips per hour during the afternoon rush-hour. 
</P>
<P>
The existing 19 million square feet of commercial development along Ventura 
Boulevard generates about 70,000 auto trips per hour. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic planners predict it will be possible to add 30,000 vehicle trips to the 
boulevard without worsening current traffic conditions -- but only if the city 
spends about $200 million on traffic improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
The projects needed to prevent gridlock on Ventura Boulevard include widening 
30 intersections to permit new right- and left-turn lanes and installing a 
computerized traffic signal system. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the specific plan called for developers to pay an average fee of 
about $5,800 for each additional auto trip on Ventura Boulevard generated by 
their projects. But Monday's report recommended an average fee of $3,600. 
</P>
<P>
The fee system also calls for $42 million of the cost of the traffic 
improvements to be spread out over all commercial property owners along the 
length of the 17-mile boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Setting up a benefit assessment district, which would allow collection of that 
money, would require a two-thirds vote of the 15-member City Council. That 
action, however, could be blocked by a majority of the affected property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
If a benefit assessment district were not established, growth along the 
boulevard would have to be restricted to far less than the 8.6 million square 
feet of development contemplated under the current proposal, Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Close of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. said he welcomed the changes 
in the plan. "They're just what we need to preserve our community," Close said, 
referring to the emphasis on the development of pedestrian retail areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Having that kind of development answers our needs because we can't widen 
Ventura," he said. "Now there's some innovation to solving these problems 
rather than erecting large parking lots and offices."

PANEL OKS $2.2-BILLION PLAN FOR 3 RAIL LINES; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: A COUNTY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS ACCEPTANCE OF A PROPOSAL LINKING THE 
VALLEY METRO RAIL EXTENSION TO CONSTRUCTION OF TWO L.A. LINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A key county rail transit committee Monday tentatively approved a $2.2-billion 
plan to build a San Fernando Valley extension of Metro Rail as well as two 
light-rail lines elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-1 vote, the Transit Committee of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission voted to recommend to the full commission, which will make the final 
decision, acceptance of a staff plan to build all three projects over the next 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Valley Metro Rail extension, the plans call for a 
downtown-to-Pasadena light-rail line and a spur off the Century Freeway 
light-rail line to serve Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners, who already have two light-rail lines and Metro Rail under 
construction, warned that they will scuttle the plan unless voters on June 5 
approve ballot propositions to raise the state gasoline tax by 9 cents per 
gallon and to sell billions in rail-construction bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Without that income, they said, the commission probably will have enough money 
to build only one of the three projects in this century. 
</P>
<P>
The staff proposal, endorsed by the committee, recommended building the LAX 
spur first, the Pasadena line second and the Valley project third. Under the 
plan, the airport link would be completed in 1994, the Pasadena line would open 
in 1998, and the Valley project would be finished in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
The designated Valley route is a Southern Pacific railroad right of way that 
crosses the Valley from North Hollywood to Warner Center parallel to Chandler 
and Victory boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
However, because of the high cost of tunneling in residential neighborhoods of 
North Hollywood, the commission has decided it can build no farther west at 
this time than the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners appeared to be on the verge of withholding their endorsement of 
the staff's 11-year rail-construction plan Monday when they learned that the 
proposal includes funds for two not yet authorized extensions off the 
downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway -- east through East Los Angeles 
and west to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan envisions setting aside $770 million for those two 
extensions, "we have never voted to do those extensions and haven't even picked 
routes," said Commissioner Jacki Bacharach. 
</P>
<P>
And Commissioner Carole Stevens complained that inclusion of the East Los 
Angeles and Westwood extensions would push the opening of the Valley line back 
several additional years for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners noted that Valley elected officials and civic leaders 
have complained about building the Valley project last. 
</P>
<P>
But commission staff planners reiterated that it would make no sense to open a 
cross-Valley line before the subway from downtown reaches North Hollywood, 
which is scheduled to occur in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, the commission's executive director, said that the East Los 
Angeles and Westwood extensions of Metro Rail were included because they are 
large enough to qualify for federal matching funds and because they have a 
projected ridership "much, much greater than any of these three lines" under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
However, staff members were ordered to prepare an alternate rail-construction 
plan without the East Los Angeles and Westwood extensions before the full 
commission takes up the issue on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners also noted that without the east and west extensions from 
downtown, a projected shortfall of $496 million in the 11-year-plan would 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
The staff has proposed closing the gap 
</P>
<P>
between revenue and cost by asking the affected cities -- chiefly Los Angeles, 
but also Pasadena and South Pasadena -- to make up the rest. Other options 
include dropping stations, building some segments of single-track line and 
getting developers to share the cost of stations. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.6-mile Valley Metro Rail extension, which has a projected daily ridership 
of 41,000, would cost $1.3 billion if construction were to begin in 1996 as 
suggested in the staff plan. 
</P>
<P>
The 13.5-mile Pasadena line, which has a projected ridership of 68,000 a day, 
will cost $688 million if construction is begun in 1994, the staff said. 
</P>
<P>
However, that estimate does not reflect the cost of 26 new rail cars bought for 
future expansion of the nearly completed Long Beach-Los Angeles light-rail 
line. The staff is suggesting the cars be switched to the Pasadena line. 
</P>
<P>
The 2.5-mile airport spur, a northward extension of the Century Freeway 
light-rail line from its western terminus in El Segundo, has a projected daily 
ridership of 12,000. It would cost $215 million if work is begun immediately, 
the staff reported.

ASSEMBLY PANEL OKS SUBWAY PROPOSAL

<P>
The Assembly Transportation Committee on Monday approved by an 11-1 margin 
legislation to require that an extension of Metro Rail through residential 
areas of North Hollywood and Van Nuys be built underground. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, a similar proposal was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, who said it 
inserted the state into a matter that should be in the jurisdiction of local 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) -- the author of both transit proposals -- 
expressed optimism that his latest measure will become law because it has drawn 
support from a variety of local groups -- from the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission to business and community associations. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen groups have protested proposals to place the line above ground because 
it would slice up neighborhoods and increase noise in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Under Robbins' proposal, 3.6 miles of the Metro Rail extension in the Valley 
would be underground along a Southern Pacific railroad right of way, partly 
following Chandler Boulevard, between the Hollywood Freeway and Hazeltine 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also exempts the acquisition of the Chandler Boulevard railroad 
right of way from provisions of state law requiring preparation of an 
environmental impact report. Because of that, the measure now must be heard by 
the Assembly Natural Resources Committee, which reviews legislation affecting 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins maintained that when the commission actually builds the Metro Rail 
line, it still would be required to study environmental impacts of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill argued that it is necessary to spell out the routing in 
state law to ensure that the Los Angeles Transportation Commission follows the 
route. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood Residents Assn., cited "a climate 
of distrust" between his community and the commission over plans to build the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman William Lancaster (R-Covina), the only committee member to 
oppose the measure, complained that Robbins was singling out the San Fernando 
Valley for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, who represents a portion of the San Gabriel Valley, which is 
competing with the San Fernando Valley for transit funds, objected to detailing 
the Valley subway route in state law because "if there's a need for change, 
they'll have to come back to the Legislature" for a new law. As a result, 
Lancaster said, he would urge the governor to veto the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, his voice rising, also expressed concern that transit funding in Los 
Angeles County was already "too oriented to one section of the county." 
</P>
<P>
But Robbins dismissed any suggestion that the measure would give a special 
break to the San Fernando Valley. "We have been paying taxes consistently and 
there has yet to be a penny" spent in construction of Metro Rail in the San 
Fernando Valley, Robbins said.

A teen-ager was killed but another escaped injury in a one-car crash Monday 
morning, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Jason A. White, 17, of Spring Valley, was southbound on Grand Avenue about 
10:55 a.m. when he lost control of his car about half a mile south of 
Eucalyptus Street, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The car, which was traveling between 80 and 100 m.p.h. -- in a 25 m.p.h. zone 
-- hit a dirt bank and overturned, crushing White's head and chest, officers 
said. White, was driving under the influence of alcohol and was not wearing a 
seat belt, officers said. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:29 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
White's passenger, Jeffrey Keeley, 16, of Spring Valley, was not hurt in the 
crash, officers said.

San Diego Superior Court employees have voted, 253-12, to be represented by the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in bargaining and 
other workplace matters, the union announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The vote follows a July, 1989, decision by the California Supreme Court to 
transfer the authority to hire and fire the San Diego court's staff from County 
Clerk Robert Zumwalt to the court's judges. 
</P>
<P>
Under a specific state law, the clerks lost the civil service benefits they had 
under Zumwalt in the transfer. Another state law gave the clerks the option of 
engaging in collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
The union represents more than 1.4 million workers nationwide, including 24,000 
court employees, it said in a statement.

A man approached a Mission Beach lifeguard Monday and admitted robbing five 
banks in March, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Robinson, a San Deigo Police Department spokesman, said that Joseph Ray 
Wait came to the lifeguard tower in the 700 block of Ventura Place and told 
Frank Day that he was "tired of running" and wanted to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Police turned Wait over to FBI agents, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The robberies occurred between March 1 and 14 throughout San Diego County. The 
first took place at the Union Bank in the 8300 block of Mira Mesa Boulevard, 
Robinson said. The robber told the teller he had a bomb, and she gave him $789. 
In the most recent robbery at Coast Savings, in the 4100 block of Governor 
Drive, $1,700 was taken, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that Wait allegedly stole more than $6,000 in the two weeks.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OKS AIRPORT NOISE EXEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a dispute at Van Nuys Airport, the Assembly Transportation 
Committee on Monday approved by a vote of 15 to 0 a bill that would exempt 
medical emergency flights from local airport anti-noise restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, by Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), would lift 
regulations limiting the time of such flights, the type of airplanes flown and 
the amount of noise they generate on departure. 
</P>
<P>
It was sent to the full Assembly for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, local ordinances would not apply if an undue delay in an 
emergency flight "would jeopardize a patient's medical condition," according to 
the committee's analysis of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette introduced the measure after neighborhood groups protesting 
airplane noise at Van Nuys Airport argued that charter companies who make the 
emergency flights, including trips for organ transplants, should fall under 
regulations that would require them to use quieter jets. 
</P>
<P>
The medical flights currently are exempt from regulation by the city of Los 
Angeles and the city Department of Airports, which restrict night takeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of such restrictions complained that the quieter jets could be 
slower, resulting in delays in transporting organs for transplant operations.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEFENSE SEEKS JUDGE'S REMOVAL AFTER MISTRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three days after a mistrial was declared, an attorney on Monday filed a motion 
seeking to disqualify a judge from presiding at the retrial of one of two 
South-Central Los Angeles men accused of killing a 67-year-old Woodland Hills 
resident during a burglary of his home. 
</P>
<P>
The motion, filed in Van Nuys Superior Court by Deputy Public Defender William 
Thornbury, accuses Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz of bias against Thornbury and his 
client, Devin Marcel Feagin, who is accused of murder, for which the 
prosecution is seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Feagin, 21, and Terrill Ross, 19, are accused of murdering Howard David King on 
April 29, 1988, while burglarizing King's house. Feagin faces the death penalty 
if convicted, and Ross could be sentenced to life in prison without the 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial judge has made remarks against counsel for Mr. Feagin which were 
inappropriate, inaccurate, made in anger, in poor taste, and with the intent of 
insulting and demeaning counsel," Thornbury's motion said. 
</P>
<P>
It also contended that Stoltz "voiced a personal belief in the prosecution's 
theory of the case which would make it impossible for Mr. Feagin to obtain a 
fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
Through a court bailiff, Stoltz said she could not comment. A hearing is 
scheduled for March 29 before Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith Meisels 
Ashmann to determine whether to grant the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Ross' attorney made no such motion, but since both men are being tried 
together, his case would also probably be transferred if the motion is granted.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 TRANSIENTS HELD IN FATAL STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old man died early Monday morning after he was found stabbed on a 
Lancaster street, and two transients were arrested on suspicion of murder hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bergen of Lancaster died at 2:30 a.m. at Antelope Valley Medical Center, 
about two hours after he was found by a passer-by at West Avenue J and Cedar 
Avenue, said Chris Wahla, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Zuniga, 33, and Rubin Hernandez, 20, were arrested and were being held 
without bail at the sheriff's Antelope Valley Station Jail. They were captured 
after being tracked by deputies and dogs for more than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ron Shreves said deputies and a canine unit tracked the suspects for 
nearly two miles before they came to a encampment of homeless people in a rural 
area near East Avenue K. They saw two men, later identified as Zuniga and 
Hernandez, running into the desert. The men were caught after a short chase. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen had been stabbed numerous times in the chest and was found on the ground 
next to the open door of his car. The motive for the slaying is under 
investigation.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECALL PETITIONS BEGIN CIRCULATING IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Petitions seeking the recall of two Burbank city councilmen accused of favoring 
developers were approved Monday. Circulators have 120 days to gather the 
signatures of about 9,000 registered voters before the issue can be placed on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to recall Michael Hastings and Thomas Flavin was begun in February 
by three residents upset over what they called "uncontrolled development, greed 
and political giveaways." 
</P>
<P>
"We have found overwhelming support for the recall and dissatisfaction with the 
way the city government is going in Burbank," said Ted McConkey, who along with 
two others filed the petitions. "People are just fed up. They have seen their 
community changed from primarily single-family residences . . . to multiple 
apartment units." 
</P>
<P>
The recall petitions must be signed by 20% -- or 8,720 -- of Burbank's 43,600 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the petitions filed with Burbank's city clerk, Flavin 
characterized the recall as "an irresponsible action driven by political 
motives." Hastings accused those seeking the recall of being "unprincipled 
dissidents." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not scared. I'm concerned," Hastings said. "I'm not going to start blowing 
the alarm until I see how serious these people are. This is a very bright 
community, they'll see through this." 
</P>
<P>
The city's only successful recall of a member of the City Council was in 1954.

<TEXT>
<P>
The door to the Padres' administrative offices swung open at 5:30 Monday 
afternoon when a stranger by the name of Bob Frans poked his head inside. 
</P>
<P>
No one paid a bit of attention to him until he opened his mouth, and let out 
the five most beautiful words the Padres have heard in months: "Your equipment 
truck is here." 
</P>
<P>
Poor Frans, he hardly had time to back the truck to the clubhouse door when 
clubhouse attendants began piling into the back, unloading the truck as if 
Opening Day was 10 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are pretty anxious, huh?" Frans said, scratching his head. 
</P>
<P>
Well, you can say that, particularly considering that Padre outfielder Tony 
Gwynn was on Interstate-8 by mid-morning, and already working out at the 
Padres' complex in Yuma before lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, our first exhibition game is in eight days, I've got to get my hitting 
in," Gwynn said. "I've got to start seeing some curveballs and sliders. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to hear anyone complaining once the season starts that they're 
not ready. No one wants to hear any excuses. We've got to produce as if we've 
been here for six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' first spring-training game is scheduled for Monday, March 26 
against the Angels, but the site has yet to be determined. The original plan 
was for the Padres to play three games in Palm Springs, but Padre and Angel 
officials were discussing an alternative Monday night where the Angels would 
instead play four games in Yuma on March 26-March 29, and the Padres would come 
to Palm Springs for four games against the Angels on April 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will not have their spring-training schedule finalized until today, 
but sources said that they definitely have called off their original trip to 
Las Vegas for a game against the Seattle Mariners. The Mariners instead are 
expected to play March 30-April 1 in Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also are discussing a plan with Dodger officials to have opening day 
April 9 at Dodger Stadium, and then returning to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
April 10 for a three-game series. The National League office has yet to make a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, I'd like to have 24 to 25 exhibition games," said Jack McKeon, 
manager and vice president/baseball operations, "but that's going to be 
impossible. You only have so many days, so you can't push guys where you're 
going to risk injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, most of these guys will already be in shape, but for the few that 
aren't we're going to have to take caution. The thing we've got going for us is 
that we have to rely on our bullpen, and we consider that our strength." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon will begin to learn just what kind of shape his players are in at 11 
a.m. (PST) today with their first official workout. Of course, it's going to be 
awhile before he can accurately assess everyone, or even see them, for that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
There are expected to be just 18 or 19 major-league players in camp for today's 
workout, and the entire 45-man squad isn't expected to be intact until 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, it's going to take some time before the coaches will even be able to 
arrive. The only major-league coach expected at the workout today is Greg 
Riddoch, while the rest will be traveling, including pitching coach Pat Dobson, 
who's driving from his home in Cape Coral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of makeshift right now," McKeon said, "and there will be until 
we can get into a regular routine. You tell me how you're going to schedule a 
practice with nine hitters and nine pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"This ain't going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
Those who figure to suffer most by this shortened spring are the youngsters and 
non-roster players hoping to make the Padre roster. There's little time, McKeon 
said, for any newcomer to make an impression, with precious few spots open, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon will be allowed to have 27 players on his roster for three weeks after 
the start of the season, and he figures to use at least one of the three extra 
spots with a relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"It will help a little, but really, all you're doing is clogging up your 
roster," he said. "What we'll probably do with the extra guys is have them go 
out there on occasion for the regulars. You may lose a few games early, but 
it's better than having guys get hurt and losing them for six to seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a lot of problems that are coming up now, but I'll tell you what, 
it's sure a whole lot more fun around here than it was a couple of days ago."

Maybe it was bad coaching. Perhaps just a rookie mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever. It happened. And you can bet freshman Stefan Mumaw will not let it 
happen again. 
</P>
<P>
It was Saturday morning -- a few hours before Christian Heritage would win the 
National Christian College Athletic Assn. basketball championship with a 106-97 
victory over Cedarville (Ohio) -- when Mumaw "attempted" to walk through a 
doorway of the team's hotel in Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Mumaw, you see, is 6-feet-9 and must duck or stoop to make it through many 
doorways. But this time, Mumaw leaned his head backward in order to gain 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
Had Mumaw been in a limbo contest, he would have lost. 
</P>
<P>
Ouch! 
</P>
<P>
The bridge of his nose met the door jam. 
</P>
<P>
Mumaw then hustled over to the nearest mirror to check the damages, and 
according to Coach Swen Nater, "saw blood and passed out right there in the 
lobby of the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, Mumaw was up and fine, and he played in the game Saturday 
night, pulling down three rebounds in relief of starting center Rob Meeter. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach kids a lot here, but I neglected to teach ducking the head while 
going through a doorway," Nater joked. 
</P>
<P>
A poor excuse for a man who stands 6-11 and has negotiated doorways of such 
buildings as Pauley Pavilion and the Great Western Forum as a center for UCLA 
and the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, perhaps Nater can be forgiven for his thoughtlessness. Next to Mumaw, 
the tallest Christian Heritage player is Meeter at 6-6 and the rest of the 
starters average just 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
That fact, is part of what makes Christian Heritage's first national title 
somewhat amazing. Another is that the school began its basketball program just 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We won our first four games that year and then reality set in," said Nater, 
who was an assistant to Jim Huckaby for two years before becoming co-head coach 
with Ray Slagle. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage finished that first season with 19 losses in its last 24 
games. It improved each year, though, and this year's club went 33-6. 
</P>
<P>
Said Nater, who won two NCAA championships with UCLA and an NBA Western 
Conference championship with the Lakers, "This is the most satisfying (title) 
I've ever been associated with because I got to be such a big part of it. Since 
the end of last season, we worked hard for this moment. I was working on 
defense, and Ray was working on offense, and we put this whole thing together." 
</P>
<P>
Nater said that the real credit must go to the players -- chief among them, the 
six seniors who have finished their careers. "The coaching staff can't take any 
of the credit," Nater said. "We had a lot of senior kids who were very 
teachable and very hard working." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but Christian Heritage also had just one junior and one sophomore to go 
with eight freshman. In addition, All-American guard Mark Kraatz played all 
four tournament games with a nasty blood blister on one of his big toes, and 
Brad Soucie played the entire season with painfully sore arches. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the final two minutes against Cedarville with Christian trailing by two 
points, Kraatz scored two baskets, had two assists and a steal to lead an 11-0 
game-ending rally. And Soucie was named the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
There were other stars, too. Nater praised Will Cunningham for his defense. 
Rundy Foster led the Hawks in the final with 27 points. And Meeter was near 
perfect from the field throughout the tournament making 20 of 24 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Add Christian Heritage: Because of the NCCAA tournament, Nater had to miss an 
engagement in which the San Antonio Spurs were honoring their all-time greats 
in a 25-year anniversary celebration. With the Spurs in 1973-74, Nater was the 
ABA's rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next year: In last week's NCAA Division III men's swimming championships, 
UC San Diego again finished behind nemesis Kenyon College of Ohio, which won 
its 11th consecutive title. UCSD finished second for the second consecutive 
year after placing third in the six previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Guarding the line: University of San Diego basketball guards Angie Straub and 
Julie Doria are playing softball this year for the Toreras. Straub, a freshman, 
is playing third, and Doria, a sophomore from San Pasqual High, is the 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Both are doing quite well. Doria is batting .392, Straub .333. Each has one 
home run to lead the team in that category. 
</P>
<P>
Moving up: U.S. International's women's tennis team moved into the top 25 two 
weeks ago based on its 6-6 record against top competition. Since then, the 
Gulls have won five in a row and are expected to move even higher when the 
latest polls are released this week.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the party seems to be over for the Japanese stock market, the party seems 
to be reviving in the United States. San Diego stocks, however, still haven't 
received the message as they continue to trade in a narrow range with a few 
exceptions, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Driven by a dollar that has achieved its highest value against the yen in three 
years, Wall Street seems to be celebrating the Japanese debacle as large 
capitalization American stocks have resumed their upward movement. 
</P>
<P>
Only four San Diego stocks managed moves of $1 or more during the past week. 
PSICOR, which matched its 1990 high of $10.75, gained $2.50 after receiving a 
favorable recommendation from a stock analyst. Magma Power gained $1. 
</P>
<P>
The largest move downward was by Molecular Biosystems, which fell $2.125 for 
the week. The stock came under pressure when an analyst for the Chicago Corp. 
reduced his 1991 fiscal year earnings estimate from $2.50 a share to $.65. This 
revision reflected the slowing of the approval process for Albunex, the 
company's ultrasound imaging agent now in development. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego National Bancorp fell $1 for the week. Rohr Industries was down $.75 
as analysts lowered earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham Pacific Properties made a new low of $17.25 shortly after the stock 
went ex-dividend on Monday, meaning that new buyers of the stock do not receive 
the upcoming $.34 quarterly dividend. Burnham Pacific stock offers a partly 
tax-sheltered 7.8% return at its present price.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: ALPHAREL INC. OF CAMARILLO REPORTS $5.19-MILLION LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alpharel Inc., the struggling Camarillo maker of computer data storage devices, 
reported that for the three months that ended Dec. 31, 1989, it lost $5.19 
million on sales of $1.01 million, compared to a loss of $2.08 million on sales 
of $2.35 million a year earlier. The large loss was due in part to Alpharel's 
$3.54-million writedown of some assets. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year 1989, Alpharel said, it lost $12.26 million on sales of $4.38 
million. In 1988, Alpharel lost $10.62 million on sales of $5.43 million. 
</P>
<P>
Alpharel also announced that its revenues under a contract with Apple Computer 
Inc. would be $200,000 less than previously expected because the scope of the 
contract has been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Alpharel further announced that Robert J. Shea, executive vice president and 
chief marketing officer, had left the company "as a continuation of its 
restructuring," and his position was eliminated. Alpharel's marketing group 
will now report to chief executive John A. Fasching.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: DATAMETRICS POSTS PROFIT OF $136,733 IN 1ST QUARTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Datametrics Corp., a Chatsworth maker of printers and other computer-related 
equipment, reported a $136,733 profit for its fiscal first quarter that ended

contracts for an Air Force program totaling $8.2 million, the largest single

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LAWSUIT AGAINST OPERATOR OF TRADE SCHOOL DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Education &amp; Software, the embattled Encino trade school operator 
that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, said a shareholder 
class-action lawsuit against it has been dismissed by a federal district court 
in Los Angeles. UES said the shareholders indicated that the Chapter 11 filing 
was a factor in their decision to drop the case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in September, 1988, after a foul-up at UES' former 
student loan processing subsidiary was uncovered by a government probe. The 
problems at the unit, which included failure to notify delinquent borrowers, 
led to a collapse in UES' stock price. 
</P>
<P>
UES also got into trouble last year after a federal audit found widespread 
problems at its National Technical Schools, a Los Angeles-based home study 
computer program. The company filed for bankruptcy protection after the 
California Student Aid Commission, the state agency that administers the 
federal student loan program, said National Technical Schools should be banned 
from the program. 
</P>
<P>
The company is still a defendant in suits filed by several banks, which stand 
to lose up to $650 million because of the loan-serving errors, and a 
$24-million suit filed by the state of California in connection with National 
Technical Schools' problems.

PLANET EARTH HEATS UP AS MEDIA ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never let it be said that San Diego media can't spot a trend. 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by the 20th anniversary of Earth Day next month, 1990 has been dubbed 
the Year of the Environment, and everyone from rock stars and actors to 
corporations and the Cable News Network is focusing on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, radio and television stations are tripping over each other to portray 
themselves as environmentally sensitive, the station doing the most to help its 
audience became more environmentally aware. In sharp contrast to past years, 
they are actually competing with each other to promote environmental projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been incredible," said Shelita Weinfield, special programs director for 
the group I Love a Clean San Diego County. "In the last three to six months, 
all the radio stations, television stations and newspapers have become excited 
about covering the things we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
The "new twist," she added, is a willingness on the part of the media to 
actually participate in events, to lend time, talent and resources beyond 
simply running public service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
"We know (the environment) is a hot issue, and we know a lot of people are 
concerned about it," said Nina Loffredo, promotions director for KKYY-FM (Y95), 
which has spent the last year building much of its public identity around 
environmentally related events. "It is the hot issue of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
From KPBS announcing it will use both sides of a page in press releases to 
conserve paper (in addition to scheduling a range of environment-oriented 
programming) to long-term educational projects, San Diego media are getting 
involved in almost every level of efforts to conserve and protect the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go to talk to folks at radio and television stations and the 
newspapers, we often find that people are personally concerned, and they're 
able to use their position to support their beliefs," said Diane Takvorian, 
executive director of the Environmental Health Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the media are simply responding to the public's intensified 
interest in environmental issues, heightened by recent disasters such as the 
oil spills off Alaska and California. People throughout the world are 
discussing the immediate dangers posed by problems with the ozone layer, the 
rain forests, the greenhouse effect and other environmental issues, which don't 
seem as abstract as they did 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that viewers, when asked what they want to know more 
about, they say the environment," said Neil Derrough, general manager of 
KNSD-TV (Channel 39), which recently added a reporter specifically assigned to 
cover environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Radio station Y95 began its environmental campaign last April, when an on-air 
request for towels to help clean otters covered with oil from the Exxon Valdez 
prompted a massive response. 
</P>
<P>
"We were buried in them," said Y95 General Manager Carolyn Howe. "People said, 
'We didn't know what to do, and you gave us something we could do.' " 
</P>
<P>
The station formed "Project Earth" to work on environmental projects. Daily 
segments give listeners helpful tips. The station also works with I Love a 
Clean San Diego County on its adopt-a-beach program. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when the Exxon Valdez came to San Diego for repairs, Y95 organized 
a protest that attracted more than 2,000 people to Fiesta Island at 6 a.m. on a 
weekday. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the media have found response to environment-related events 
overwhelmingly positive. 
</P>
<P>
A phone line focusing on the environment established by XTRA-FM (91X) nine 
months ago recently drew more than 4,000 calls in a week. Part of the "X Line" 
-- which offers callers a menu of concert, club and job information, surf 
reports and other informational recordings -- the environment line offers 
callers information on recycling, beach cleanups and local environmentally 
oriented activities. 
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the environment, station General Manager Mike Glickenhaus said, is 
a natural link among the station, its young, rock 'n' roll audience and the 
politically active bands that come to town. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the bands we've been involved with have taken a leadership role" on 
the environment, Glickenhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
Rival rock station KGB-FM (101.5) is also working on environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll has already proven its ability to inspire and lead," said KGB 
promotions director Scott Chatfield. "Now's the time to put it to work again." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to collecting and mailing thousands of "Rescue the Future" post 
cards to local politicians and other related activities, KGB is the radio 
sponsor for the "EarthFair," which will be staged in Balboa Park on April 22 in 
conjunction with the local celebration of Earth Day. Takvorian said several 
radio stations are vying for the opportunity to sponsor EarthFair. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus among environmental scientists is that we've got 10 years to 
change the direction of mankind's relationship with the Earth before our 
present course becomes irreversible," Chatfield said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the immediacy of the problems -- a new-found sense that the dangers 
have reached a critical point -- has helped spark the media to do a better job 
of reporting the issues. The Times, the San Diego Union and the San Diego 
Tribune each have reporters specifically assigned to cover the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier when we call (the media), the interest is greater," said Takvorian 
of the Environmental Health Coalition. "There is more of a sense of the press 
being interested and then doing follow-ups, more in-depth pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Television, with its constant need for visuals, has always had a tougher time 
covering broader environmental issues, such as the greenhouse effect and acid 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
Environment stories "just don't yield daily photo opportunities tailored to the 
eye-blinking attention span of the media," Mark Hertsgaard wrote in a recent 
issue of Rolling Stone magazine. "How do you take a picture of the Earth 
getting hotter?" 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39's Derrough said he had wanted to add an environmental reporter for 
several months but couldn't find the right reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment is one of the issues people love to say they like, but when 
you put it on the air, it comes across dull," Derrough said. "It's difficult to 
make it good TV." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 reporter Michael Settonni will be aided by a producer and cameraman, 
dubbed the "E Team." 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully they will pick issues that won't lull people to sleep, although 
sometimes you have to bite the bullet and do the best job you can," Derrough 
said. 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10) news director Paul Sands said he also is planning to add a 
reporter specifically assigned to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation," said Weinfield of I Love a Clean San Diego County. 
"If you take on any other issue, you can get in trouble. If you take on the 
environment who can say you're a bad guy?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, cynics may accuse the stations of simply joining a trend. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that it is a politically favorable project now," said Bob 
Bolinger, general manager of KKLQ (Q106). "Some may say we're jumping on the 
bandwagon, but, if we're helping, I say, so what?" 
</P>
<P>
Weinfield agrees that the result is more important than the motive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping it's not just a flash in the pan kind of thing."

OXNARD WEIGHS EXPANDED WATER STORAGE EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with possible cutbacks by the city's major water supplier, Oxnard 
officials today are scheduled to consider expansion of an experimental 
water-saving project. 
</P>
<P>
Begun last year, the project allows the city to buy excess water at a bargain 
rate from the Metropolitan Water District during winter months when demand is 
low. The water is pumped into the ground, then taken out during the summer as 
the city needs it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the same problem everybody else does," Oxnard Public Works 
Director Jim Frandsen said. "We've got three sources of water and now this 
storage program." 
</P>
<P>
The city draws one-third of its water from city wells and the United Water 
Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
But two-thirds of its water comes from the Metropolitan Water District, which 
passed a resolution last week calling for cutbacks to the cities and water 
agencies it serves. 
</P>
<P>
The state drought, now entering its fourth year, has depleted the Colorado 
River and the Northern California rivers that supply the MWD with water. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the MWD's largest customer is the Calleguas Water District, 
which supplies cities such as Oxnard in the eastern county. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the storage program, though, Oxnard may be able to make it through 
the summer without any water-use restrictions regardless of any MWD reductions, 
Frandsen said. However, the city still will work on developing an emergency 
water conservation ordinance, as MWD officials requested of customers. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which began the program in October, has 1,700 acre feet of water 
stored, or 544 million gallons. It should be able to recover 90% of the water, 
which will retain the same quality, when it is pumped out of the ground, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The lower cost of the water has allowed the city to save about $37,380. Oxnard 
pumps water into the ground from October through April, then removes it from 
May through September. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the city is expected to decide whether to expand the program from two 
wells to four. The project would cost $240,000, although the council is 
expected only to approve funding the first well today. 
</P>
<P>
Once both wells are operational, the city could store 5,950 acre feet of water 
and reap an estimated annual savings of $305,830 because of the lower winter 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
To speed up the expansion process, Frandsen has recommended that the council 
waive the competitive bidding process and select Midway Drilling and Pump 
Company to install the first shallow well at a cost of about $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
This well would be operational in September, 1990, and the fourth one a year 
later. Once all four are in use, the city would be able to store 3 1/2 times 
the water it now stores with two wells.

STATE FUNDS STUDY OF ETHNIC LIBRARY USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheryl Duran of Camarillo has received a $41,457 grant from the California 
State Library to study how American Indians, Latinos and Asian-Americans use 
the library as a resource. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, assistant dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Library and Information 
Science, said the grant will be used for a yearlong study examining whether 
members of those ethnic groups throughout Southern California use the library 
as a primary resource or instead go first to authority figures within their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Duran, who is Cherokee, said members of the Indian community will 
often go to an elder in the tribe when seeking information. 
</P>
<P>
The study will compile the names of such people, and librarians will work with 
those community sources to improve library services for the various ethnic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The study will also examine limited English-speaking skills as a factor in 
library use. 
</P>
<P>
Duran will oversee the study, which will be conducted by a doctoral student and 
other research students from UCLA's library program, she said.

2 CHALLENGE FLYNN OVER FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Oxnard men charged Monday that Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn was 
unethical in failing to disclose that his St. Patrick's Day party was a 
political fund-raiser -- a claim disputed by a former state elections official. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn denied the allegations by Scott Bollinger and Paul Dolan, saying that the 
$10 tickets to the Sunday afternoon party clearly linked it to his "Flynn for 
Supervisor" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just frivolous," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said he had opposed Bollinger and Dolan -- both of whom have run for 
different offices in Oxnard city government -- on different issues. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 people attended the three-hour party Sunday that included a band, 
food, prizes and a poll on local issues. The phrase "Flynn for Supervisor" 
appears on the tickets. Flynn is in his fourth term as 5th District supervisor, 
which covers Oxnard and unincorporated areas of the county. His term expires in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Bollinger and Dolan have called for an investigation by the Ventura County 
district attorney and the California Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stern, election law specialist and former general counsel of the Fair 
Political Practices Commission, said there would be some concern if people 
bought tickets without realizing the event was a political fund-raiser. But 
Stern said there are no requirements by the commission regarding identifying a 
fund-raiser on a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Coleman of the Ventura County district attorney's office said he had not 
seen the complaint.

<P>
Raytheon Co. officials said Monday that they will try to transfer some of the 
400 workers who will be laid off from their Oxnard plant to other facilities in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Raytheon plant, operating in Oxnard since the late 1940s, will close in 
mid-May, eliminating jobs for all employees at the telemetry facility. 
</P>
<P>
The telemetry company has facilities in Goleta and Mountain View. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Raytheon will help employees find new jobs at other area 
businesses. Raytheon also will offer classes to employees on resume writing, 
interviewing skills and other job-hunting activities, said Ed Powers, the 
company's public relations manager. 
</P>

The Oxnard plant was involved in manufacturing instrumentation used to measure 
the performance of missile systems during test flights. CAROL WATSON

COYOTE COEXISTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Department of Animal Regulation suggests some things to do 
-- and to avoid -- to protect your pets from coyotes: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DO 
</P>
<P>
* Keep small pets -- cats, rabbits, small dogs -- indoors. Even large dogs 
should be kept inside after dark. 
</P>
<P>
If you must keep a pet in the yard, build six-foot fences around it, with 
outward extenders at the top of each post. String two or three strands of wire 
along the extender to prevent easy scaling by coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
* Feed pets indoors. If you must feed them outside, promptly remove dishes when 
the meal is finished. 
</P>
<P>
* Clear brush and dense weeds from around your property. This deprives rodents 
(which attract coyotes) of shelter. It also reduces protective cover for 
coyotes. Use traps and rodenticides, if needed, to remove rodents. 
</P>
<P>
* Use trash barrels with tight clamping lids to prevent coyotes or other 
animals from spilling the barrels' contents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DON'T 
</P>
<P>
* Leave small children unattended in areas known to be frequented by coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
* Feed or provide water for coyotes or other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
* Put trash cans out the night before the scheduled pickup. Wait until morning, 
when coyotes will have less time to scavenge and won't have the cover of 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
* Use plastic bags as garbage containers. Coyotes can easily rip them open.

<P>
The basic bus fare in the Antelope Valley, which has not changed since 1982, 
would increase from 50 cents to 75 cents under a plan by Los Angeles county 
officials to improve service. 
</P>
<P>
The county also is proposing to increase the fare for students, senior citizens 
and the handicapped from 20 cents to 35 cents, county officials said. If 
approved by the Board of Supervisors, the changes could take effect later this 
year. County officials said the increases -- 50% in the basic fare and 75% in 
the discount fare -- will help fund expanded bus service to meet demands in the 
fast-growing region. In the past four years, bus ridership in the Antelope 
Valley has almost doubled.

Graduation at Cal State Northridge will return to campus this spring in the 
wake of last year's problem-plagued ceremony conducted at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Commencement is scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. May 25 at the stadium, located 
on the university's North Campus. Seating will be available for about 20,000 
students, parents and other guests, said commencement planner Heidi Levy. Levy 
said problems last year -- which included an hours-long traffic jam that 
delayed the arrival of participants and guests, including university President 
James W. Cleary -- had little to do with the change. "The desire was always to 
hold it on campus whenever it could be," Levy said.

RECALL PETITIONS GAIN APPROVAL

Petitions seeking the recall of two Burbank city councilmen accused of favoring 
developers were approved Monday. Circulators have 120 days to gather the 
signatures of about 9,000 registered voters before the issue can be placed on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to recall Michael Hastings and Thomas Flavin was begun in February 
by three residents upset over what they called "uncontrolled development, greed 
and political giveaways. We have found overwhelming support for the recall and 
dissatisfaction with the way the city government is going in Burbank," said Ted 
McConkey, who along with two others filed the petitions. "People are just fed 
up. They have seen their community changed from primarily single-family 
residences . . . to multiple apartment units." The recall petitions must be 
signed by 20% -- or 8,720 -- of Burbank's 43,600 registered voters.

SEEING LOYOLA WIN IS BELIEVING -- BARELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Some still can't believe the ease with which Loyola Marymount blew through the 
first two rounds of the NCAA tournament's West Regional in Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a distraught team trying to overcome the death of 
center Hank Gathers. And those weren't patsies they were playing. It was New 
Mexico State, a team with 26 victories -- including one over Nevada Las Vegas 
-- that fell, 111-92, in a 45-point assault by Bo Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
And that was Michigan, the defending national champion, that lost, 149-115, and 
looked so befuddled that at one point six Wolverines were on the floor and 
another was trying to check in. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Loyola was making 21 three-pointers and Jeff Fryer was scoring 41 
points on only 20 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions were so purposeful and focused in returning to the court after 
teammate Hank Gathers' death two weeks ago that much of press row was openly 
rooting, something rarely seen in the sportswriting world. 
</P>
<P>
When Kimble, Gathers' friend since grade school, sank a left-handed free throw 
Friday in Gathers' honor, a veteran wire service writer sitting courtside said 
he got chills. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Heinsohn, watching on TV, said he was nearly brought to tears. 
</P>
<P>
Team members and opponents were talking about the Lions in mystical terms. 
</P>
<P>
There were remembrances of Gathers all around Long Beach Arena, from the small 
black "44" patches and hand-written notes on the shoes the Loyola players wore 
to Hank hankies the students waved to signs reading "Hank's Here" and "The 
Strongest Team Alive." 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether the Lions can maintain their intensity when they face 
Alabama on Friday in the Western Regional semifinals in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Lute Olson, whose team also played in Long Beach, said he had 
never seen a similar performance over two consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they're playing right now, I don't know if the Lakers could match up," 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost eerie. It's obvious they're on a mission. I don't know if I've 
ever seen a college team play better than Loyola this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Said Michigan Coach Steve Fisher: "Loyola is on a crusade." 
</P>
<P>
Lion Coach Paul Westhead, who rode the team bus to the arena in order to gauge 
the team's emotional state Friday, said, "I've allowed them to let the natural 
emotion and energy to unravel. Our guys were so relaxed (Sunday) that 
numbers-wise there is no limit. It (149 points) could've been more." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, seeded 11th in the West, took Monday off and will return to the 
court today -- one of 16 teams still practicing. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said: "The only logic I can make out of the seeding was (the NCAA) 
obviously placed a very high value on Hank Gathers and they must have evaluated 
we would be a significantly weakened team without him. I wasn't insulted. I 
took it as a tribute to Hank." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' tribute continues, in high gear.

JIM MURRAY: HE EARNS A FISTFUL OF RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have never been a fan of the prizefighter, Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
I am now. 
</P>
<P>
I thought he was overrated. I thought he was too small, too slow, couldn't 
punch hard enough, couldn't box oranges. 
</P>
<P>
He really wasn't impressive. All he seemed to bring into the ring with him was 
an infinite capacity to stand pain, absorb punishment and remain upright. In 
the old days, they'd dub a fighter like this the Rubber Man and use him as a 
trial horse, a kind of complicated punching bag for the real contenders. 
</P>
<P>
How he won 68 fights with no defeats confounded me. All I could think of was 
Leo Durocher's line about Eddie Stanky: "He can't run, he can't hit, he can't 
field -- all he does is beat you." 
</P>
<P>
My colleagues wrote that Chavez was, pound for pound, the best fighter in the 
ring. I thought that was sacrilegious. Sugar Ray Robinson was the 
pound-for-pound fighter. They invented the term for him. He could do everything 
Chavez couldn't -- punch, box, move. He only got hit every other eclipse of the 
moon. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Cesar Chavez fought like a guy on snowshoes. He made his fight like an 
oncoming train. Nothing nifty about it. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, you find out more about a man in a fight he loses. I found out about 
Julio Cesar Chavez in a fight he lost in Las Vegas the other night. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, I know the record books will say Julio Cesar won that fight but, take my 
word for it, he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
He took a right proper licking for 11 1/2 rounds. At least I thought he did. So 
did two of the ringside judges. A guy who was not so sure was referee Richard 
Steele. Well, he was closer to the action than any of us. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you saw it, perhaps only read about it, but Julio fought a pretty 
nifty, speedy Philadelphian, the ex-Olympic gold medal winner Meldrick Taylor. 
Now, Taylor was not 68-0 but he was 24-0-1, which is the next best thing. He 
had one draw to mar his record. 
</P>
<P>
He gave Chavez a pretty good going over most of the fight at the Hilton in Las 
Vegas. He repeatedly got off first and winged three punches to Julio's one. He 
dug lefts in Julio's body that seemed to lift him two feet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, he made only one mistake in the whole fight: He got up. That is to 
say, he got up at the count of five when he got knocked down at the end of the 
12th round. 
</P>
<P>
When he got up, the referee stopped the contest. There were two seconds -- 2 
seconds! -- left in the fight. It was the most astonishing hook in the history 
of the fight game. More than 9,000 jaws dropped in the arena, and on cable 
television, millions couldn't believe their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible there were not 10 seconds to go in the fight when he got knocked 
down. The red light was blinking in the corner over his head, signaling that. 
If the count had gone to nine, he could have been saved by the bell and won the 
fight. Under modern rules, the only round in which you can be saved by the bell 
is the last. 
</P>
<P>
You didn't know whether to laugh or get mad. At first, it looked as if good old 
pugilistic gamesmanship was at work here. Bear in mind that Chavez is a Don 
King fighter and that King still wields considerable influence over the conduct 
of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
What was Steele stopping this contest for? Well, he explained, not altogether 
convincingly, that he was able to see when Meldrick got up, that the fighter 
was badly hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Indubitably. But then Steele said he didn't want Meldrick to absorb any further 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
From whom? From his corner men? They were going to slap him around with wet 
towels, were they? 
</P>
<P>
There were only two seconds left in the fight. I told you, Julio Cesar is slow. 
He couldn't get across the ring in two seconds, let alone start to land 
punches. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Steele would have wiped off Taylor's gloves, the final bell would 
have rung. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I yield to no man in my belief that you cannot stop a one-sided fight too 
soon. But I must admit you can stop one too late. 
</P>
<P>
But, having said that, and before you call your congressman, let's examine the 
performance of Julio Cesar in that fight. Let us render to Cesar the things 
that are Cesar's. 
</P>
<P>
I am not sure he deserved to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
It is the notion here that the point system is not always felicitous in judging 
the outcome of a fight. Fights used to be to the finish and, although that 
seems barbaric, there are times when you should take into account the relative 
condition of the fighters at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
I will tell you why: There are certain fighters who more or less concede the 
first few rounds of a championship fight to their opponents. They are 
exploring, not fighting, probing for weaknesses. If early rounds counted, in 
war, Germany and Japan would have been the winners of World War II. Let's put 
it this way: They had a great first half. But you don't score a football game 
by quarters or a baseball game by innings. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Cesar Chavez strikes me as being that kind of a fighter who would 
discount the early rounds. He is like a plumber trying to find out where the 
leak is. When he finds it, he goes to work on it. 
</P>
<P>
There was the interesting discovery at the fight Saturday night that, as the 
rounds wore on, you began to notice a peculiar thing: Taylor was doing all the 
landing -- but Taylor was doing all the bleeding, too. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's punches might not look all that impressive, but their results are. 
Taylor was swollen in both eyes and bleeding from the nose and mouth as the 
bout wore on. Even if he had won, it could not have done him a great deal of 
good. He looked like a guy who had just been run over by a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez is a study in indomitability. His heart, pound for pound, is the biggest 
in the game today. He didn't win the fight by the Marquess of Queensberry 
rules. But Richard Steele might have served a kind of poetic justice at that. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Cesar Chavez not only didn't lose a fight, he gained a fan. I'm a fan 
from now on.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: THE LOCKOUT AFTERMATH; 
</P>
<P>
THE AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Highlights of the agreement reached Sunday by major league players and owners: 
</P>
<P>
* Salary arbitration eligibility for 17% of the players with between two and 
three years of service. Those players must have spent at least 86 days on the 
roster in the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
* A $100,000 minimum salary for major leaguers, up from $68,000, and a $25,000 
minimum for minor leaguers, up from $22,700. 
</P>
<P>
* An annual $55-million contribution by owners to the players' pension fund, up 
from $39 million in the last year of the old agreement. 
</P>
<P>
* Either side may reopen the contract on principal economic issues after three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
* Rosters will stay at 24 players this season, expand to 25 in 1991 and stay 
that way through expansion. 
</P>
<P>
* The National League will announce a timetable within 90 days for expansion by 
two teams. 
</P>
<P>
* The union will get triple damages if owners are found guilty of collusion 
again. 
</P>
<P>
* The deadline moves from January to October for clubs to decide whether to 
arbitrate with former free agents covered by repeater restrictions. If a club 
chooses not to arbitrate, the player can become a free agent again without 
waiting the required five years. 
</P>
<P>
* There will be a six-man study commission on revenue sharing and baseball 
economics.

TRIP TO HUNGARY REMINDS SOCCER COACH OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is so crowded for the annual Spring Festival that residents approach 
weary-looking tourists to inquire whether they need rooms in their homes for 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Even spring has come to Budapest, although it is not likely to stay much longer 
than the tourists. Pretty girls in miniskirts walk arm in arm with their proud 
beaus; young couples, pushing babies in strollers, and joggers unselfishly make 
room for one another on the promenade alongside the Danube. 
</P>
<P>
"As I'm sitting here, along with the river, some thoughts are floating by," Bob 
Gansler says as he watches life's parade from a park bench. 
</P>
<P>
He is a Hungarian of German descent, but the story he tells over the next hour 
as he sits under the blue sky next to the not-so-blue Danube is one of 
post-World War II America. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler was born a few miles west of this river almost 49 years ago, near the 
Yugoslavia border in the small farming village of Mucsi. 
</P>
<P>
The village was Hungarian according to the map but German in every other way, 
including heritage, traditions and language. When he was 5 years old, his 
family moved to West Germany, remaining there for six years before emigrating 
to a city on the other side of the Atlantic with a large German population -- 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
He has returned to Budapest as coach of the U.S. soccer team, which plays 
Hungary tonight. The last time he was here was in 1979, when he was the 
assistant coach for a U.S. team that scored a stunning 2-0 victory over 
Hungary, traditionally among the best teams in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed since then as Hungary and its Eastern Bloc neighbors race 
toward democracy. In the square where only 34 years ago Russian tanks 
discouraged a revolution, campaign posters advertise next Sunday's free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a graphic photo display of the bloody uprising in Beijing's Tian 
An Men Square, a hardly subtle reminder that it is better for the people, 
rather than the People's Army, to control a country's destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Attracting more attention, a Hungarian rock band plays '60s music. The vocalist 
speaks no English, but he can sing it, mimicking Chuck Berry and the Beatles in 
appropriately accented American or British. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, operator," he wails, "get me Memphis, Tennessee." 
</P>
<P>
By the river, it is quiet. Politics, borders, trends and even people change. 
The Danube is constant. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some small recollections of the town I was born in, my interaction with 
my grandfather. Not my father; he was off to war," Gansler says. "You wonder 
what might have been had you stayed here." 
</P>
<P>
The Ganslers and the Bittners, his mother's family, were among the thousands of 
Germans who came to this country in the mid-18th Century at the invitation of 
Maria Theresa, the empress of the Holy Roman Empire, the queen of Hungary and 
Bohemia, and the archduchess of Austria. Hoping to repopulate her empire after 
a series of costly wars with the Turks, she offered homesteads. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community of about 3,000 or 3,500 people was entirely German," Gansler 
says. "The school, the church, the businesses were all German. We even called 
our mayor by the German title, burghermeister." 
</P>
<P>
As a young boy, Gansler did not know his father, a soldier in the Hungarian 
army who fought on the side of the Nazis in World War II. He was captured on 
the Eastern front by the Russians and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. 
</P>
<P>
The most influential man in Gansler's life was his maternal grandfather, 
Janczi, who before the war provided for the family by periodically traveling 
across Western Europe to the Netherlands and stowing away on a freighter headed 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
His destination invariably was Milwaukee, which at the time was nearly as much 
German as American. Without speaking a word of English, he was able to work for 
the railroad as a repairman or night watchman until he had enough money to send 
home so his wife could buy another acre of farm land. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of World War II, the Ganslers and Bittners were relatively 
prosperous. But that changed in 1946, when the triumphant Russians forced all 
Germans, even those whose families had not lived in Germany for more than two 
centuries, out of Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Take whatever you can take on your back,' and put us on the 
nearest freight train to Germany," Gansler says. "It was no Holocaust, but we 
lost everything we had. It was part of the punishment for being German. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything at that point was absolute chaos. It took us two weeks to make a 
trip that should have taken eight hours. Whenever the Russians needed an 
engine, they took the one off our train and brought it back a couple of days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only 5, but I remember playing under the train. The mothers would come 
screaming in panic when the engine was being hooked up again. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather told me about men making visits to the woods and having to 
chase the train in their underwear when they heard it leaving again. I don't 
know about that. He was a story teller. He liked to embellish things." 
</P>
<P>
Not long after the refugees arrived in Ruckingen, West Germany, near Frankfurt, 
Gansler's father was released from the prison camp and, through the Red Cross, 
reunited with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler was introduced to soccer as a schoolboy in Germany, developing a 
lifelong infatuation with the sport that enabled him to become the first coach 
in 40 years to take the United States to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
What might have been had he stayed in Mucsi? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing pertaining to soccer, he supposes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the kind of village where nobody had time for athletics," he says. "You 
worked and you worked, you slept, and you worked again. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents went four years full time to school, and, for an additional two 
years, they went two days a week. By the time you were 10 or 12, you were out 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer didn't come up until I started going to school in Germany. At every 
recess, every day after school, there was a soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
"It always took me half an hour longer to get to school in the morning and half 
an hour longer to get home in the afternoon because I was kicking something 
along the way -- rocks, tin cans, whatever else. It's like inner city kids are 
in the U.S. with a basketball. That's the way I grew up." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with all that kicking was that in postwar Germany hardly anyone had 
more than one pair of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather tried to convince me to play soccer barefooted," Gansler says. 
"He said, 'If you get a hole in your foot, God will take care of it. If you get 
a hole in your shoes, it'll cost me money." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler has fond memories of Germany but it was not home for his family. 
</P>
<P>
"In Hungary, we were the Germans," he says. "In Germany, we were the 
Hungarians. Basically, we were displaced persons." 
</P>
<P>
The International Catholic Welfare Organization came to their rescue, offering 
families free one-way trips to the United States, Canada or Australia. 
Gansler's father, Adam, chose the United States, settling in Milwaukee because 
of the contacts Janczi Bittner had made there, and became a bricklayer. 
</P>
<P>
There were no youth soccer leagues, but Gansler soon was introduced to the 
mysteries of baseball. Because he had a strong arm, he was dispatched to center 
field. But his first experience with a fly ball ended in embarrassment when he 
allowed it to drop in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
"I treated it like a soccer ball," he says. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he finished high school, he had the game figured out to the extent 
that was he was offered a rookie league contract as a catcher by the Milwaukee 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very bright, but I looked at Class D, C, B, AA and AAA and decided I'd 
better go to college," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But while attending Marquette University, he continued to play soccer for one 
of the nation's best amateur teams, the Milwaukee Bavarians. 
</P>
<P>
"The key reason I stayed with the sport was because the Bavarian Soccer Club 
was more than just a place to play the game," he says. "It was an extended 
family sort of thing. Germans are very club-oriented. The friends I made there 
then are my friends now. 
</P>
<P>
"Every first Friday of the month when I'm home, we have a sing-along. We 
pretend we still know the old songs. No, that's wrong. We do know the old 
songs. We pretend we can sing them." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife and four children belong to one other club in Milwaukee, made 
up of natives of Mucsi and their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventy-five percent of that little village is now in Milwaukee," he says. 
"After being spread all over the world, they just found each other."

Athletic Director Gary Cunningham named Colson to succeed Ron Adams, who 
resigned with two weeks left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Adams had a 42-69 record in four years as the Bulldogs' coach. 
</P>
<P>
Colson, 55, is credited with playing a key role in revitalizing the offense at 
Cal, which made it to the NCAA tournament this year for the first time since 
1960. The Bears beat Indiana in a first-round game, 65-63, then lost to 
third-ranked Connecticut, 74-54. 
</P>
<P>
Colson is the nation's 12th-winningest active coach with a record of 487-312. 
</P>
<P>
Colson was coach at Valdosta State in Georgia for 10 seasons, starting in 
1958-59, went to Pepperdine for 11 seasons, starting in 1968-69, and then was 
at New Mexico for eight seasons, starting in 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
He was forced to resign at New Mexico by former athletic director John Koenig, 
who resigned himself shortly thereafter in the midst of allegations of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico went 22-14 in 1987-88, Colson's last season there, and was ranked 
18th after a 14-3 start. But a late-season slump cost the Lobos an NCAA 
tournament berth. They went to the tournament the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
Colson arrived at New Mexico in 1980, after a scandal that involved FBI 
wiretaps as part of a gambling investigation. Uncovered, among other things, 
were fake transcripts for junior college transfers. Coach Norm Ellenberger was 
convicted of 21 counts of providing false public vouchers.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: THE LOCKOUT AFTERMATH; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS; 
</P>
<P>
FREEWAY SERIES IS DELAYED ONE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers, who will open training camp at Vero Beach, Fla., today, will play 
their first spring training game Monday against the Minnesota Twins in Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
And the Dodgers will face the Angels in the annual Freeway Series, only a week 
later than originally scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Dodgers might open the season at Dodger Stadium with a day game 
against the San Diego Padres on April 9, the same day the Angels open the 
season at Anaheim against Seattle at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
April 9 is a scheduled day off for the Dodgers, with a three-game series with 
the Padres to begin the next night in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get word from the commissioner's office before we can do anything," 
Executive Vice President Fred Claire said Monday from Vero Beach. "We'll know 
more tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Claire also said that the exact dates of the Freeway Series are yet to be 
determined. It could be Friday through Sunday, April 6-8, or Thursday through 
Saturday, April 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some details to work out," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Dodgers play the Twins next Monday, they will play the Montreal Expos 
on March 27 in Vero Beach and then the Atlanta Braves on March 28 in Vero. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are off on March 29, and spring training games after that will be 
announced later. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said that the team would like to stay in Vero Beach until April 5. "The 
longer we can stay in Florida the better," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said he thinks a three-week spring training would be long enough for 
position players, but probably not long enough for pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"Three weeks is workable," he said. "But for pitchers, it's a different story."

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: THE LOCKOUT AFTERMATH;

ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST WORKOUT SCHEDULED FOR TODAY IN MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a month of waiting for spring training to begin, the Angels on 
Monday scrambled to pack their bags and their cars and get to Mesa, Ariz., in 
time for today's workout at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You kind of get complacent after all that time, and it looked like it was 
going to last for a while," said pitcher Jim Abbott, who spent the first day 
after the lockout running errands and gathering his gear for the drive to Mesa. 
"The settlement came so suddenly and (the first workout) came so fast. I'm 
excited to get started again. This is the time of year you start to get 
baseball fever." 
</P>
<P>
Although most Angel players spend the off-season in Southern California and 
were quickly notified, others were harder to track down. Chuck Finley had gone 
home to Louisiana, Rich Monteleone was contacted in Florida and Tony Armas was 
in Venezuela. Still, every player had been found by late Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials had less success finding hotel rooms in Mesa and players will be 
scattered at several hotels, rather than settling into one headquarters hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players' equipment was sent to Mesa at the end of last season, and 
the rest was packed and trucked to Arizona Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the players there wasn't as simple. Keeping the vagaries of airline 
travel in mind, General Manager Mike Port said he would not discipline any 
players who did not arrive in time for today's workout. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd certainly like them there before Wednesday, though," Port said. "But I 
think most of them will be there, judging from the response we got when we were 
calling our fellows when word came out (Sunday) night. Some apparently were on 
their way over, if not already on station in Mesa (Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' initial plan is to work out in Mesa through Sunday and then shift 
to Palm Springs, where they will pick up their exhibition schedule at Angels 
Stadium next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and possibly Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
They have seven open dates -- which are likely to be filled as soon as 
arrangements can be worked out -- until they face the Dodgers in the annual 
Freeway Series, probably on April 6, 7 and 8, a week later than originally 
scheduled. Two of the games will be at Dodger Stadium, the other at Anaheim 
Stadium, although the order has not yet been determined. Tickets are available 
through each team's box office. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the Angels' regular-season games went on sale Monday at Anaheim 
Stadium and at Teletron and Ticketron outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Port said the entire preseason schedule would be more certain today, once 
revisions are completed and approved by the New York offices of major league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' April 9 home opener against the Seattle Mariners will now be their 
season opener. The six games that were wiped off their schedule, three at 
Seattle and three at Oakland, could be made up in doubleheaders later in the 
season or in an extra week tacked on to the end of the current schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Port, who plans to leave for Mesa today, said he does not anticipate that the 
shortening of spring training will give players an insufficient time to prepare 
for the season and result in an inordinate number of injuries to players. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitchers were working out regularly Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 
(Anaheim) Stadium, at least until Feb. 15," he said. "I respect all the 
players' professionalism and I think I'm very safe in saying they've all been 
working out to the best of their ability in the interim." 
</P>
<P>
Players said, too, that they were happy to finally be going to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife was ready to kick me out of the house a month ago," Bert Blyleven 
said. "It's been very hard. Our livelihood is baseball and we couldn't devote 
ourselves to that. I'm happy it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish said: "It was kind of an emotional roller coaster. You're 
pumped up for the beginning of the season, then all of a sudden there's no 
spring training, then you get your hopes up because you hear things that 
indicate it might end, then you get the rug pulled out from under you. . . . I 
just hope the fans haven't put baseball out of their minds."

THE NBA;

<P>
NETS ARE MORE THAN HAPPY SAM BOWIE CAN PLAY IT AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The center with a heart of gold and legs of chalk has cemented his future, and 
in something other than plaster of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But knock on wood, because what has been learned from the strange odyssey of 
Sam Bowie is that nothing is certain except today. Tomorrow may bring another 
broken bone. After all, he has been in more casts than half the Screen Actors 
Guild. In his first four seasons as a pro, he played in 139 games and missed 
319. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, though, Bowie is everything promised. After all the injuries and last 
June's surprising trade from Portland to New Jersey, he has emerged, just in 
time to be in great bargaining position, what with his contract running out 
after this season. 
</P>
<P>
The former No. 2 overall draft pick, the guy the Trail Blazers took ahead of 
Michael Jordan is, best of all, playing every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who said, 'Why would the Nets want to get him?' now understand," Coach 
Bill Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
They understand because Bowie, who played 63 games the last three seasons 
combined and is already at 57 for 1989-90, was averaging 14.3 points and 10.3 
rebounds heading into Monday night's meeting with Philadelphia. And because he 
is a 29-year-old, 7-foot-1 center with quickness and a shooting touch and a 
desire to remain in New Jersey when the current contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate this will be resolved before it ever gets to the point of free 
agency," Bowie said. 
</P>
<P>
Meaning negotiations are already progressing. There's no question the Nets, who 
sent their one true commodity, Buck Williams, to the Trail Blazers for Bowie 
and a first-round draft choice that became Mookie Blaylock, want him to stay. 
So the feeling is mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an up-and-down year personally," said Bowie, one of the few bright 
spots on a team that went into the 76er game with a 15-49 record and battling 
Miami to stay out of last place in the Atlantic Division. "It is exciting to 
play well. On the other hand, we have been struggling. And the way the ball 
club is struggling is very disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt that, when healthy, I could put up good numbers in this league. 
The funny thing about pro ball is that a lot of the players are the same ones 
you went against in college. I have always been confident that I could do as 
good against them here as I did at Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
Said Fitch: "He has become, night in and night out, an offensive threat. The 
thing that hurt him the most in all the time out is that he didn't get to 
develop the quickness that great centers have. Slowly but surely, you can see 
his inside game developing." 
</P>
<P>
Nominations for bonehead move of the decade are closed. Though veiled in good 
intentions, Mike Abdenour, the Detroit Pistons' trainer, put himself in an 
unbeatable position earlier this month by filing a false 911 emergency call. 
</P>
<P>
It happened March 6, two days after Hank Gathers died in Los Angeles. Abdenour 
wanted to find out how long it would take for help to reach the Palace of 
Auburn Hills, so after practice he had a security guard call 911 and say a 
Piston had collapsed on the court. 
</P>
<P>
When an ambulance, fire truck and two police cars arrived in front of the arena 
in five minutes, Abdenour was waiting, with the explanation. He also commended 
the rescue personnel for the immediate response. 
</P>
<P>
They, in turn, filed charges. Last week, Abdenour, calling the escapade a major 
mistake, pleaded no contest in a Rochester (Mich.) court, was fined $200, put 
on six months' probation and ordered to perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Portland Trail Blazers have moved up among the NBA's elite, 
they're getting treated better by owner Paul Allen, who has been leasing a 
private jet for the team since the new year. 
</P>
<P>
They have repaid him by going 12-6 on the road since then, including a recent 
trip with consecutive victories at New York, Boston and Philadelphia, and by 
staying close to the Lakers in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest benefit is the physical -- sometimes getting back home on the night 
of a road game, avoiding flight delays and standing around air terminals. But 
the psychological factors aren't far behind. The plush travel has worked so 
well that some players have suggested, not necessarily jokingly, that they feel 
guilty stepping into Blazer I after a loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Having real good players gets you more wins," said Geoff Petrie, the Blazers' 
vice president for business operations. "But I think it has been a factor. 
There's no question when the team goes on the court they're in a better frame 
of mind. It certainly has been a positive." 
</P>
<P>
It has to be more than a coincidence that Portland, which was 10-22 away from 
home at this time last season, has the third-most road victories in the league. 
The Trail Blazers trail only Detroit and the Lakers, who also travel on their 
own planes. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons have bought and the Lakers lease, but, like Portland, all claim 
spending some extra money in the travel pays off in other ways. This month 
alone, the Trail Blazers won at Boston and Philadelphia for the first time in 
the same season, and tonight at Houston they go for a franchise-record sixth 
straight road victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you took a poll of players and coaches, they'd all say it has been 
better than they would have expected," Petrie said. "You really can't 
appreciate this until you do it on an ongoing basis." 
</P>
<P>
Only three teams do, though a couple of others have occasional charters. The 
BAC 111 the Trail Blazers use is similar to Detroit's Roundball I, with the 
original capacity of 80 cut down to 20 for couches, a wet bar and buffet, VCRs 
and televisions. 
</P>
<P>
Portland leases the plane from Louisiana Pacific Corp., which bought it from a 
far-more famous individual and immediately removed the round bed from a private 
compartment. It's more conservative now. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? The Trail Blazers seem to be having more court success these days 
than Leona Helmsley. 
</P>
<P>
New York has clearly identified itself as the best team not to look for in the 
championship round. At least it will take a big turn-around if the Knicks are 
to advance far in the playoffs, despite what the Atlantic Division standings 
say. 
</P>
<P>
What the 39-25 record doesn't show is that they are 5-15 against teams with a 
winning percentage of .600 or better. Or that during one recent 18-day period, 
they lost to Portland, Detroit and twice to Philadelphia. Or that they have 
been swept by the Lakers, Blazers and 76ers and are down, 3-0, to the Pistons 
with one game left. 
</P>
<P>
Get the idea? There's more. 
</P>
<P>
Against the league's nine best other teams -- Pistons, 76ers, Bulls, Celtics, 
Lakers, Jazz, Trail Blazers, Suns and Spurs -- New York is 6-17. Even better, 
the Knicks have not won, nor do they lead, a season series against any of the 
above. 
</P>
<P>
Though it's not going to happen as soon as most would have liked, all 
indications are that the Golden State Warriors are getting a new arena without 
even asking for one, a sign that Oakland realizes the value of an NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have another year left after this season on the lease at Oakland 
Coliseum Arena, a 15,025-seat facility without luxury boxes. They also hold a 
pair of one-year options after that. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the state-of-the-art arena was supposed to start next October, 
but the announcement that the Raiders are returning altered everyone's 
schedule. Still, the Warriors have been assured that a $70-million arena with a 
capacity of 19,000-20,000, including 120 luxury boxes, is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
It would be on the same site as the current facility and the Oakland Coliseum, 
home of the Athletics and, someday, the Raiders. City officials expect to keep 
all three, using the old arena for ice shows, circuses and the like to avoid 
conflicts with basketball. To assure enough parking spaces, plans are to create 
a double-deck lot on site.

DICKERSON, WHO HAS SOUGHT NEW PACT, SAYS HE WILL QUIT

Eric Dickerson, who has sought to renegotiate his contract with the 
Indianapolis Colts or be traded, told an interviewer for an Indiana television 
station that he intends to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm through with football, and (the Colts) know it. 
</P>
<P>
So I'm telling you, I'm finished," Dickerson, 29, said in an interview 
broadcast Monday on WFYI-TV's "Indiana Tonight" show. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Irsay, the Colts' general manager and son of owner Robert Irsay, said 
through a spokesman Monday that the team expected Dickerson to fulfill his 
contract obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson has said his contract expires after the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
During the 20-minute interview, taped last Thursday at his Los Angeles home, 
Dickerson, the seventh-leading rusher in NFL history, said he has lost interest 
in playing football. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I really don't love the game that much," he said. "I don't love it 
like I did at one time. But rather than stay in Indianapolis and take the 
pounding that I'm taking, I'd rather quit. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's like taking a revolver and putting a bullet in it and spinning it 
around and sticking it to my head, and sooner or later a bullet is gonna come 
out and kill me. And that's the chance I'm taking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't do that. I like my health. I'll take my health, and no amount of 
money in the world can buy my health."

TOUGHEN DISCIPLINE POLICY, REPORT URGES L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing evidence that only about 3% of students who brought weapons to school 
last year were permanently expelled, a new report charges Los Angeles Unified 
School District officials with failing to stem campus violence and recommends 
sweeping changes in student-discipline policies. 
</P>
<P>
The report, commissioned by the Los Angeles Board of Education, said current 
school policies do little to combat campus violence because school officials 
put the welfare of violent students ahead of the safety of law-abiding students 
and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Written after 10 months of study, the report, made public Monday, called for 
the mandatory expulsion of students who commit assaults or bring guns on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-member "School Safety and Security Task Force" -- made up of parents, 
educators and law enforcement officials -- was formed by the board last May at 
the request of West San Fernando Valley board member Julie Korenstein to look 
into campus violence. It came in the wake of a wave of highly publicized school 
crimes in the 610,000-student district during the 1988-89 school year, 
including the stabbing of a junior high school English teacher by a student 
during class. 
</P>
<P>
The report will be formally presented to school board members Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The task force was especially critical of district officials for expelling only 
15 of the 438 students who were recommended for expulsion for bringing weapons 
to school during the 1988-89 school year. Some 122 cases were dropped, the 
report said, and 299 students were suspended and later transferred to other 
district schools. The report called for a greater number of permanent 
expulsions from the school system. 
</P>
<P>
The task force found that other Los Angeles County school districts during the 
1987-88 school year expelled 52% of the students for whom expulsion was 
recommended. Expulsions are allowed under the state education code for students 
bringing weapons or drugs to school or who are involved in assaults. 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion seems obvious," the report said. "The LAUSD is overly concerned 
with the welfare of its most violent offenders and has, consequently, placed 
the safety of the other students and staff in serious jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
The task force recommended the Board of Education require mandatory "straight 
expulsion" -- without the right to enroll in another district school -- of 
students found guilty of assaults causing serious injury and for using or 
possessing a firearm on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Such students would have to enroll in special schools operated by Los Angeles 
County for troublesome students until they reach the legal age to leave school, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988-89 school year, district officials reported 1,025 crimes 
involving weapons, including 374 assaults involving deadly weapons, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For students who commit lesser crimes or who fail to obey school authorities, 
the task force recommended the district transfer them to special junior and 
senior high schools. The report recommends 20 sites throughout the city for 
creation of such schools, but does not say how the financially strapped 
district will pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of special schools for problem students would replace the current 
district practice of disciplining students with behavior problems by 
transferring them to other schools, the report said. About 3,700 junior and 
senior high school students were issued such transfers last year for 
disobedience and physical violence, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
A student with a history of violence received such a transfer to a junior high 
school in Sylmar and later stabbed his English teacher in the back. The woman 
has since recovered from her wounds but has not returned to teaching. The boy 
was expelled and later sentenced to eight years in the California Youth 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Such transfers, the report said, "are likely to help only a small percentage of 
these maladjusted students." 
</P>
<P>
The task force also recommended: 
</P>
<P>
The assignment of an assistant superintendent solely to oversee student 
discipline and school crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
Establishment of a districtwide computerized tracking system that would alert 
teachers and administrators to the identities of violent students transferred 
to their schools. 
</P>
<P>
Schools be given counselors and other resources to attempt to reform students 
before their behavior turns to violence. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein said she plans to ask her colleagues to adopt the recommendations 
made by the task force. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be one of the most ambitious undertakings in terms of combating 
school violence, and it is long overdue," Korenstein said. "If the only remedy 
we have for discipline problems is transferring that kid to another school, 
then we're in a vicious cycle."

SECESSION: SOVIET PREMIER MOVES TO STOP REBELLIOUS REPUBLIC FROM DISENGAGING 
ITS ECONOMY FROM NATION'S.

<P>
The Soviet government, acting under orders from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
moved Monday to assert its authority in Lithuania and prevent the small Baltic 
republic from implementing plans to secede from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov instructed central government ministries, 
including the KGB, the Soviet security agency, to act immediately to stop 
Lithuania from carrying out a program that would disengage the republic's 
economy from that of the Soviet Union as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov, in his order broadcast Monday evening on radio and television, told 
his ministers to assume direct management immediately of all centrally owned or 
operated enterprises in Lithuania and not to enter into any negotiations with 
Lithuanian authorities about their takeover. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered the Interior Ministry and the KGB to prevent Lithuania from 
establishing its own customs system and thus controlling trade between it and 
the rest of the Soviet Union. Other steps will be taken to prevent the republic 
from creating its own banking system and issuing its own currency. 
</P>
<P>
The order also calls for "radically increased" security around a nuclear power 
station and "other vital installations that are federal property," and this 
seemed likely to bring the deployment of large numbers of police and troops 
around Lithuania to guard key facilities. 
</P>
<P>
With tensions continuing to escalate between Lithuania and Moscow, the central 
government's moves were its first to counter Lithuania's declaration of 
independence last week, and the official news agency Tass implied that further 
measures would be taken if necessary to halt the planned secession. 
</P>
<P>
But Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis replied in Vilnius, the 
republic's capital, that for all the harshness of Moscow's statements, which 
condemned Lithuania for "crude violations of constitutional norms" and damage 
to the Soviet Union's interests, the move was probably "an introductory stage 
of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The differences between Lithuania and the Soviet government, Landsbergis said, 
should and could be resolved through negotiations. In any event, he added, 
Lithuania wants to maintain its economic ties with the rest of the Soviet Union 
but put them on a fairer footing. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's Parliament voted overwhelmingly March 13 to re-establish the 
independence it had from 1918, following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, 
until it was forcibly incorporated by the Soviet Union in 1940, along with its 
neighbors, Estonia and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, while strongly opposed to Lithuania's secession, has called for a 
"respectful dialogue" between Moscow and the republic with the hope that 
through this means, the Soviet Union can be transformed into a truly federal 
state. But failure to do so quickly will probably bring the secession of not 
only Lithuania but other restive republics. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, decided Monday to put on its 
immediate agenda a bill that sets out the methods and requirements for 
secession by a constituent Soviet republic -- there are 15, including the 
Russian Federation, the largest. 
</P>
<P>
As drafted, the bill would require popular approval in a referendum, extensive 
negotiations between the republic, the central government and neighboring 
republics, and finally, approval by the Congress of People's Deputies, the 
national Parliament. All that would be followed by perhaps a five-year delay to 
ensure a smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
A government statement, signed by Prime Minister Ryzhkov, was both conciliatory 
and accusatory. It said that Moscow views "with understanding the problems of 
political, social, economic, cultural and ethnic development" in Lithuania and 
respects "the striving of its people to strengthen the sovereignty of the 
republic and renovate its society." 
</P>
<P>
But it also accused the Lithuanian leadership of planning to turn over 
state-owned factories to private entrepreneurs, to issue its own currency and 
to establish customs posts on the republic's borders. All these are elements in 
the economic development plans that members of Sajudis, the Lithuanian 
nationalist movement, have proposed, although action depends on the republic's 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's efforts to "undermine its links" with the rest of the Soviet Union 
would have "pernicious consequences" for the whole national economy, the 
government said in the statement, declaring its determination to protect the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of Monday's measures were protective, described as intended to 
ensure smooth functioning of the economy, their purpose was clearly to prevent 
Lithuania from taking control of its whole economy and to uphold the authority 
of the central government. 
</P>
<P>
Ceslovas Iskauskas, a commentator on Lithuanian Television, denounced the 
statement in a Vilnius broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a big superpower is simply violating the constitutional law of a 
sovereign republic," he said. "It is intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania had sent a six-member delegation to Moscow with a letter from 
Landsbergis to Gorbachev replying to a resolution by the Congress of People's 
Deputies last week declaring "invalid and illegal" Lithuania's proclamation 
"re-establishing" its independence. 
</P>
<P>
"We were made to understand that some sort of measures would be introduced," 
Egidius Bichkauskas, a lawyer and former Communist Party member who headed the 
delegation, said after the meeting. "No one is panicking. We had to expect 
this. . . . It is a warning, an attempt to put pressure on us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We do not rule out that some limited contingent (of soldiers) could be sent, 
but the reason given will be to safeguard the situation." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Soviet warplanes buzzed Vilnius in what many Lithuanians consider an 
attempt at intimidation, and troops conducted maneuvers in the countryside in 
several areas of Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady I. Gerasimov, chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said in 
Moscow that the operations were not extensive and had been planned long in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
But Landsbergis told Lithuanian legislators that the exercises had added to 
tensions with Moscow and that he has asked local commanders to notify his 
government well in advance of future maneuvers and to avoid "any coincidence 
with political developments." 
</P>
<P>
Many Lithuanians say they expect Moscow to impose an economic blockade, 
depriving the republic of the fuel and raw materials that it receives only from 
the Soviet Union if it proceeds with its plans for independence. But the 
government statement contained no such threats and, on the contrary, emphasized 
Moscow's desire to maintain present economic ties. 
</P>
<P>
En route to Africa, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is due to meet 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze during Namibia's independence 
celebrations today, said he would raise the Lithuania dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Bush 
Administration is "monitoring" the situation in Lithuania and repeated Bush's 
desire to see negotiations take place between Lithuania and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
But Fitzwater declined to comment more specifically on the Soviet military 
maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to say anything that would tend to exacerbate problems or 
attitudes on either side," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration continues to withhold recognition of Lithuania's 
independence. U.S. recognition must await the point at which the Lithuanians 
are "in control of their territory," Fitzwater said, repeating a statement 
President Bush made last week. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, worried about the spread of separatist feeling to the other two 
Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia, also met Estonian President Arnold 
Ruutel and other members of the local Communist Party leadership here on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting had agreed on "the need for prompt decisions to 
give a clear and full answer on the content of a renewed federation and 
independence of republican parties," Tass reported later. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonian Popular Front appeared to be headed for victory in the republic's 
parliamentary elections last week, but final results are not due for several 
days because of the republic's complicated voting system. 
</P>
<P>
In Latvia, candidates backed by the Latvian Popular Front have secured 120 of 
the 170 seats decided in Sunday's first-round elections in the republic, and 
the movement still hopes to win enough seats in the second round to give it the 
two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution -- and secede. The 
republic's Parliament has a total of 201 seats.

PRECIOUS ARTWORKS ARE SECOND ONLY TO NARCOTICS AS A LURE FOR GLOBAL CRIMINALS. 
SOARING PRICES, AND MORE SOPHISTICATED THIEVES, ARE FUELING THE BOOM.

<P>
The wood-paneled offices are tucked away on the fourth floor of the Explorers 
Club in Manhattan -- a nice bit of symbolism -- and serve as a central clearing 
house in the international search for stolen art. When the phone rang on 
Monday, it was no surprise that the FBI was on the other end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
The agent in the Boston field office wanted to know if the International 
Foundation for Art Research could print a special bulletin with pictures and 
descriptions of a dozen priceless masterpieces taken from the Isabella Stewart 
Gardner Museum in Boston Sunday -- the biggest theft of old masters in the 
nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI and the Gardner Museum want to get the word out," said Constance 
Lowenthal, the foundation's executive director, who immediately began planing a 
mini-magazine which will be sent to collectors, art dealers, museums, insurance 
companies and law enforcement agencies around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the robbers) obviously stole it very well," Lowenthal said. "The next 
part is more difficult to carry off. It requires a different set of skills to 
insert these works of art into the art market." 
</P>
<P>
Her colleague, Margaret I. O'Brien, speculated that the works by Rembrandt, 
Degas, Manet and Vermeer could well prove impossible to dispose of because of 
all the publicity. But they could also be held for ransom, or possibly dealt to 
a collector intent on having a masterpiece no matter what the origin. Art 
experts said Monday that the astounding haul from the Gardner -- possibly the 
biggest art theft in modern times -- underscores what law enforcement officials 
have realized for more than a decade: stealing art works has become the second 
biggest international criminal activity after narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
The boom in stolen art is fueled partly by soaring prices, increasing 
sophistication of thieves and the low priority many thefts get from law 
enforcement agencies busy focusing on violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
Lowenthal's group maintains files on more than 30,000 stolen art cases. More 
than $100-million worth of paintings, sculpture, decorative arts and 
antiquities are stolen each year on average around the world. A single case 
like the Gardner theft can balloon that number dramatically. Although the 
museum will not put a price on the missing masterpieces, some experts say the 
value could be a quarter-billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
And while the masterpieces may prove to be challenging to unload, lesser 
artworks are almost liquid assets in today's art underworld. Experts estimate 
that only 5% to 10% of stolen artworks ever finds its way back to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be amazed at how many folks are dealing unknowingly with stolen art," 
said Milton Esterow, editor and publisher of ARTnews magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more of the thieves know exactly what they are doing. They know the 
difference between a Rembrandt and a Botticelli," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As thieves have become more knowledgeable about the art world, more 
sophisticated, law enforcement activities in the United States have diminished, 
and that's disgraceful," Esterow added, noting that offenders, when 
apprehended, often receive light sentences. 
</P>
<P>
"Thefts have gone up for two reasons," Lowenthal said. "The value of what is 
stolen has risen so dramatically. Thieves who used to steal other things have 
learned there is value in art and antiquities. They are willing in some cases 
to accept 1% of market value when they sell stolen goods. They sell to 
unscrupulous dealers who don't ask any questions." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Gardner thefts, "It's difficult to figure out what the 
thieves will do with the art if you think of it in the normal manner of buying 
and selling," said Detective William Martin, a Los Angeles Police Department 
art theft expert who has worked in the field since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were investigating this case, I'd be looking at ransoms and rewards," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston thieves might demand a ransom from the museum or an insurance 
company, he said. If a reward is offered, an accomplice "might just happen to 
be walking down an alley and spot one of the paintings in a trash can," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One case involving a ransom occurred last year, when thieves stole three 
paintings by Vincent van Gogh from the Kroeller-Moeller Museum in Otterlo, 
Holland. They demanded a $2.2-million-ransom and returned one of the works. The 
others were later recovered and four suspects arrested. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely the Boston thieves are working for a collector, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to hear that thieves steal to order for some mad collector who 
will hide the art in a castle . . . (but) the joy of collecting is showing your 
collection. Theft is done for profit. The basic motivation is money," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, occasionally thefts are commissioned for works that cannot be 
legitimately acquired. One such theft occurred in 1983, when thieves stole 
Italian Renaissance masterpieces, including Raphael's self-portrait, from the 
Hungarian national museum in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that a sophisticated band of Italian art thieves, armed 
with cutting tools and high-tech alarm-busting devices, executed a perfect 
break-in and vanished with the works. 
</P>
<P>
An extensive dragnet eventually snared the thieves in their home country before 
they could get the paintings to Greece where, it was later found, an olive oil 
baron had paid a handsome sum for the sake of having the works hang in his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't many thieves with that sort of expertise," said Robert Volpe, a 
former New York City police detective who worked on the Hungarian case and is 
now a private consultant tracing stolen art around the world. "They were 
capable of stealing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Recoveries are relatively rare but when they occur, they are celebrated in 
"IFAR Reports," the monthly publication of Lowenthal's group. The magazine 
listed 10 important recoveries in 1989 in its December issue. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is "one of 21 Dutch Old Masters stolen at gunpoint in a daylight 
raid on a Zurich gallery, and allegedly transported to the U.S. in a diplomatic 
pouch." The painting by Dutch master Adrian van Coorte was recovered through 
the efforts of New York dealer Richard Schillay, who was offered some of the 
works, according to the journal. 
</P>
<P>
A lithograph, "Sick Child," by Norwegian Expressionist Edvard Munch was 
returned to an Oslo collector after a citizen's tip about a suspicious driver 
led Norwegian police to a cache of stolen art. 
</P>
<P>
Auguste Rodin's bronze "Mask of a Man With a Broken Nose," stolen from the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art, turned up under a sewer pipe in the basement of a 
Philadelphia truck driver, thanks to an anonymous tip. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's auction house was responsible for another recovery, listed in the 
publication. A double-sided drawing by Rembrandt "induced gasps of excitement" 
when it was delivered to the auction house for consignment, but it was later 
found to be property stolen in 1979 from the Rembrandt House Amsterdam, the 
IFAR publication reported. 
</P>
<P>
Documentation is essential to recovering a stolen work of art. When law 
enforcement officers receive vague descriptions of stolen property, such as 
"oil painting, multi-colored" or "painting, abstract," as is typical of thefts 
from private collections, they can't help. 
</P>
<P>
But when photographs and complete documentation of stolen artworks are 
available, as it is for works in major museum collections, the information can 
be circulated and the items can be easily identified if they are found. 
</P>
<P>
The Gardner thefts prove that American museums have a serious security problem, 
but they are better prepared than European institutions, which are often housed 
in antiquated, ill-equipped buildings. Of all the art-rich countries, Italy 
probably has the greatest difficulty protecting its treasures, some of which 
still sit around in open churches, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been an increase in museum thefts in America during the last two 
years, principally back east," Martin said, noting that "there hasn't been a 
major museum theft in Los Angeles for a long, long time." Martin credits that 
record to effective preventive measures. "The security in major museums in Los 
Angeles is excellent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Art museums have become more security conscious and installed increasingly 
sophisticated security systems during the last decade, he said. Effective 
security for a museum includes a "very sophisticated, up-to-date alarm system, 
24-hour protection by trained security officers and back-up cataloguing of 
items in the collection," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Given that effort, the Gardner theft sent shock waves through the museum world. 
"I'm just devastated. It's a terrible loss," said Deborah Gribbon, associate 
director for curatorial affairs at the J. Paul Getty Museum. "People may get 
the impression that the Gardner is a lax institution or that it is 
understaffed, but that's not true. It's not a situation where they were a 
sitting duck," said Gribbon, who was curator of the Gardner from 1976 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty, the Los Angeles area's most conspicuous center of art wealth, has 
always been security-conscious, Gribbon said. "But there's no question that you 
take a look at what you are doing after something like this," she added. "The 
Gardner theft underlines that excellent security people are the ultimate line 
of defense, and ours are extremely good." 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly an incident like this causes all museums to reflect on and review 
their procedures." said Jeanne Collins, director of public information at the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Museums typically do not insure artworks for full replacement value. Rates are 
prohibitive and the money is better spent on prevention, museum officials and 
insurance agents agree. 
</P>
<P>
While museums have the most valuable collections and are vulnerable to the 
largest losses, dealers whose doors are open to the public are probably even 
more susceptible. Longtime dealers say that security is a relatively recent 
worry, but an extremely serious one now. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any security at all when I started out here about 55 years ago; 
it wouldn't have occurred to anybody to take a work of art," said Klaus Perls, 
owner of Perls Galleries on Madison Avenue in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very hard to get rid of art in any way you wanted to -- you couldn't 
sell it and there were very few people who wanted it. In the museums, there 
were some precautions but they were more about fire than stealing." 
</P>
<P>
Perls was a victim of theft in January, when a mobile by Alexander Calder was 
stolen through a domed skylight. "You would not believe the kind of 
fortifications we have in our place now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers who exhibit at antique shows across the country deliver objects to 
armories or halls where the exhibitions are held using unmarked vans or trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"All drive trucks with nothing on the side panels," said Wendell Garrett, 
editor of the magazine Antiques. "Anonymity is the best thing." 
</P>
<P>
It is also the first line of defense for many private collectors. Being 
identified as the owner of a major artwork once was regarded as a status 
symbol, but "you go to exhibits nowadays, and most labels say 'loaned by a 
private collector' rather than identifying the owner," said Jim Reinish, senior 
vice president of New York's Hirschel Adler Galleries. Experts say that while 
spectacular robberies like that at the Gardner Museum may make headlines, 
smaller thefts are more common. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the International Foundation for Art Research adds over 2,000 works 
of stolen art to its files. They include liturgical objects like a 19th-Century 
silver chalice stolen in Seraing, Belgium; a 16th-Century Gothic clock taken in 
Zurich; an Egyptian statue of a standing man stolen in New York, and a 
20th-Century Tiffany Studios peony lamp taken last June in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation put out a special art theft alert offering a $100,000 reward for 
a private collection of 60 pieces of art, antiquities and Oriental and tribal 
sculpture stolen last March in New York City. It included a Picasso pastel and 
pencil drawing and an Egyptian Middle Kingdom standing man.

MAJOR RECENT ART THEFTS 
</P>
<P>
MARCH 18, 1990 -- Two robbers dressed as police officers steal 11 paintings and 
an ancient Chinese beaker from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. 
The stolen paintings included works by Rembrandt, Degas and Vermeer. The works 
are said to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
DEC. 29, 1989 -- Eight works by Matisse are reported missing from the Nice 
apartment where the French artist had lived. Police recover the works, with an 
estimated value of $12.5 million, during a routine traffic stop Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
NOV. 5, 1989 -- Works worth at least $17 million are taken from the home of 
Picasso's daughter, Marina Picasso, including seven paintings by Picasso, a 
Brueghel and a bust by Rodin. 
</P>
<P>
SEPTEMBER, 1989 -- Works worth $3 million, including 81 Andy Warhol 
lithographs, are stolen from a gallery near Bonn, West Germany. Authorities 
recover the works from a Dutch art dealer. 
</P>
<P>

SHAPING NEW EUROPE A COMPLEX, HISTORIC TASK; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: EAST GERMANY'S VOTE INCREASES PRESSURE. THE RUSH TO UNITY MAY BE 
MORE DISRUPTIVE THAN EXPECTED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The surprise landslide victory by East Germany's moderate-right alliance in 
weekend elections puts more pressure on strategists already facing a task of 
historic complexity: shaping institutions of European integration and security 
to replace the outdated structures of the Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
The process has been compared in its importance to the Congress of Vienna in 
1815, which reordered a Continent left adrift by the collapse of the Napoleonic 
empire and molded its future for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Modern architects of the "new Europe" taking shape after last year's round of 
revolutions in the former East Bloc already faced the additional challenge of 
having their work covered live on television. 
</P>
<P>
And now, since East Germany's victorious Alliance for Germany campaigned on the 
promise of rapid unification, the timetable for German reunification, one of 
the three most crucial elements in the strategic equation, may be faster and 
potentially more disruptive than both the United States and the Soviet Union, 
among others, had expected. 
</P>
<P>
There was already widespread agreement that a meeting of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, planned for late this year, would be a 
useful forum in which to discuss "some sort of new security structure for 
Europe," noted James Eberle, director of London's Royal Institute of 
International Affairs, in an interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The conference includes all the European countries, except Albania, as well as 
the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Eberle said, "there will be a renewed pressure to define the agenda for 
that conference rather more carefully and closely, and (to) bring up proposals 
that will be discussed as part of that meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The East German election results also lend new urgency to the problem of 
interim arrangements for the five years or so that it will take to negotiate a 
longer-term security solution, Eberle commented. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrangements are part of the agenda of the "two-plus-four" talks under 
which the two Germanys are negotiating international aspects of reunification 
with the four major victorious powers of World War II -- the United States, 
Soviet Union, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
"German unity has a potential of dividing the world or bringing it closer 
together," said Michael Sturmer, director of West Germany's Research Institute 
for International Affairs in Ebenhausen. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he added, 
"Germany will make the difference between NATO reform and NATO breakup; between 
continuing East-West detente or a new confrontation, between an Atlantic 
security framework for the European Community or European impotence." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the high-sounding verbiage, the talk here about a "new Europe" deals 
with fundamental questions of war and peace, of poverty and prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
And it touches importantly on the debate in the United States over the 
so-called peace dividend from the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, a 
debate that Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) told London's Sunday Times will "determine 
the political and economic future of the country for 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War may have created a balance of terror on the Continent, but it did 
yield a sort of stability. Now, if NATO and the Warsaw Pact become increasingly 
irrelevant, what institutions can prevent antagonism between two countries such 
as Hungary and Romania from getting out of control? What other mechanism would 
allow the nations of Europe to coordinate a response to an attack on one of 
their number by a Libya or an Iran? 
</P>
<P>
Not only must any new or remodeled institutions pass the difficult test of 
keeping a united Germany committed to its integration in the democratic family 
of European nations, European strategists say; they must also minimize the 
continental aftershocks from the possible disintegration of an increasingly 
unstable Soviet Union. And they must maintain the stabilizing presence of the 
United States on the Continent against any temptation that Washington may 
entertain to withdraw in the same way it did after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
The most urgent specific question facing the architects of the new Europe 
following Sunday's elections is the status of a united Germany in NATO. But it 
is far from the only one. 
</P>
<P>
Other alliance members and even a majority of the rival Warsaw Pact now say 
that a united Germany in NATO is either essential or at least preferable to 
German neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets say they want a neutral Germany and insist that NATO membership for 
a united state is unacceptable. However, in a possible sign of Kremlin 
flexibility, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said after an inconclusive 
Warsaw Pact meeting in Prague last Saturday that "this is a question which 
requires further discussion and clarification." 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that the Soviets are holding out for a neutral Germany as 
a bargaining chip to be traded for Western concessions on other guarantees to 
its security. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the Kremlin finally agrees to NATO membership for a united Germany, 
it will be at best a temporary reprieve, according to Zbigniew Brzezinski, who 
was President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost inevitable," Brzezinski told Czechoslovakia's Institute of 
International Relations in Prague late last week, "that Germany will insist on 
changing its status from that of a military partner in NATO to that of only a 
political participant . . . . Germany, some 50 years after (World War II) will 
insist that it no longer wishes to be, in effect, a quasi-occupied country." 
That would lead to the departure of both Soviet and Western forces from its 
soil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That prospect, Brzezinski added, points up the importance of "designing added, 
all-European security arrangements." He argued that it is "counterproductive to 
advocate a slowing down in the process of German unification. . . . Rather than 
try to delay the unification of Germany, it is far more sensible to accelerate 
the process of creating an international framework for the new Germany." 
</P>
<P>
While West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday depicted German 
reunification as forcing the pace of European unity, others raised doubts about 
its impact on the European Community's drive toward economic and monetary 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corp.'s Ceefax news service quoted Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher on Monday as saying that a long transition would be required 
before what is today East Germany is drawn into the European Community. She 
said that subsidized goods could not be allowed to flood into the Common Market 
for fear of undermining Western businesses and that there would have to be 
major changes to the community's agriculture and fisheries policies. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens had warned previously that the European 
Community is in danger of "unraveling" under the pressure of the revolutions in 
Eastern Europe. And Jacques Delors, president of the community's Executive 
Commission, has described himself as "haunted by anxiety as well as by hope" 
over the impact of German reunification on the European integration process. 
</P>
<P>
The heads of government of the community's 12 members have called a special 
summit meeting April 28 in Dublin, Ireland, to discuss the implications of 
German unification on the community. 
</P>
<P>
"A society only has a certain amount of political resources that can be 
concentrated on internal or external problems," commented John Roper, 
director-designate of the West European Union's new Institute for Security 
Studies. So what he calls the "deepening" of European union "may take second 
place to matters of inner-German development in the next five years." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean European integration will be reversed, Roper stressed. But it 
does suggest that "we won't be able to accelerate the process."

ON CALIFORNIA: THE CITY THAT NOBODY LOVES TO LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a pile of news clippings on my desk, maybe two inches high, all about 
the loathing of Los Angeles. This is a curious theme because it exists 
side-by-side with the notion of L.A. as paradise. Call it a sub-theme if you 
want, but people have always loved to hate L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago, Los Angeles was the object of national scorn because it was 
seen as goofy. Remember that? People in L.A. dressed in citrus colors and spent 
long, nonverbal weekends under a lanai. Life was regarded as too easy here, and 
that ease inspired ridicule in places where winters still happened. 
</P>
<P>
These days, you don't hear much about the goofy theory. Probably it faded 
because no one would even pretend that life is very easy in L.A. anymore. And 
there's also the sheer success of Los Angeles. When it takes half a million 
dollars to finance a comfortable house in a decent neighborhood, the word 
stupid no longer seems a good match. 
</P>
<P>
But in its place has come something else, a new form of L.A. hate. Maybe some 
cities are born to accept the animus of outsiders and, if so, L.A. is the 
champ. In any case, this new version is darker, less playful. It seems to grow 
out of some kind of fear. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this story from San Diego, which is true except that the names have 
been excised for reasons that will be obvious. 
</P>
<P>
A company with headquarters in Los Angeles decides it wants to establish a 
branch office in San Diego. There's good demographics there, etc., etc. So the 
newly appointed manager of the branch office sets out to find suitable quarters 
and chooses a building in San Diego's downtown. Everything looks good. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the L.A. company is an enterprise of considerable size, and the branch 
office will fill a big chunk of the building. So the manager approaches the 
building owner and inquires about the possibility of putting the logo of his 
company at the top of the building. A little signage to announce the L.A. 
company's arrival in town. 
</P>
<P>
This sort of arrangement is made every day in a big city, but this time the 
building owner hesitates. The branch manager is confused and decides to press 
further. Finally, the owner comes clean. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing personal, the owner says. It's just that the company's name happens to 
contain the name of the home city. Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This is San Diego, see, says the manager. There's strong feelings about Los 
Angeles down here. If I put the name of Los Angeles on the top of my building, 
there might be some resentment around town. I might, in fact, find it difficult 
to sign up other tenants to my building. 
</P>
<P>
No sign. 
</P>
<P>
You see this kind of thing everywhere these days. Seattle had a bad case of 
L.A. hate about a year ago, led by a local newspaper columnist who once 
suggested that visitors from Los Angeles be fixed with electronic tracking 
devices to make sure they didn't outstay their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is San Luis Obispo, where ranches are being churned into ranchettes 
and the whole process blamed on L.A. expatriates. Not long ago, there was a 
state Assembly race in Modesto where one candidate distributed pamphlets 
showing a squadron of bulldozers carving up the land. The message of the 
pamphlet was "Don't Los-Angelize Modesto." 
</P>
<P>
I repeat: Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
As an exercise, it's interesting to ask what exactly these people hate. First, 
of course, you hit on the obvious. There's the cars and the smog and the sheer 
ugliness. But let's get past that. Chicago is plenty ugly and it hasn't been 
turned into a verb. You think Muncie worries about being "Chicagoized?" 
</P>
<P>
No, there's something else about L.A., a perceived evil that transcends all the 
cars and the smog. People from outside L.A. sense a deep malignancy to this 
city that is not associated with Chicago or Houston or New York. The feeling 
seems to be that L.A. is not only cancerous but capable of metastasizing. It 
can plant its urban oncogenes in other cities and so must be regarded with 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the most curious thing of all. When New York or Chicago is slurred, a 
host of defenders will rise up. They concede the sins and love their city 
anyway, like they love a member of their family. 
</P>
<P>
But L.A. seems to have no defenders. I have a friend who says that after years 
of living here, he feels no closer to L.A. than when he used to watch it on TV. 
In fact, he says, the two experiences seem to be much the same. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that explains some of the outside scorn. San Diegans and Seattlites 
sense the love gap here. If its own people will not defend a city so rich and 
successful, what then is wrong with Los Angeles?

'FREEWAY KILLER' APPEAL REJECTED BY U.S. JUSTICES; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: WILLIAM BONIN, CLAIMING LAWYER HAD A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, IS 
DENIED A NEW TRIAL. FIFTEEN OTHER CALIFORNIA DEATH ROW APPEALS ARE ALSO TURNED 
DOWN.

<P>
The Supreme Court turned down an appeal Monday from "Freeway Killer" William G. 
Bonin, who was sentenced to death for murdering 14 teen-age boys in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
On a 7-2 vote, the justices rejected Bonin's contention that he was denied a 
fair trial because his lawyer had a conflict of interest. (Bonin vs. 
California, 88-7381.) 
</P>
<P>
Bonin's was one of 16 Death Row appeals from California that the justices 
rejected Monday, but the only one that prompted a written dissent. 
</P>
<P>
The other appeals challenged jury instructions used in California death penalty 
cases. Two weeks ago, in a similar case involving Richard Boyde, the killer of 
a convenience store clerk in Riverside County, the justices on a 5-4 vote 
upheld the constitutionality of the instructions. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, they dismissed all appeals raising the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
The high court actions do not mean that Bonin or any of the other Death Row 
inmates face imminent execution, state attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be two or three years at least" before Bonin faces death, 
said California Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane Gillette, who coordinates death penalty 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Bonin can file new appeals on different grounds in federal court 
in Los Angeles. Even if those actions are quickly rejected, the case moves on 
to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"The 9th Circuit is notoriously slow," Gillette said, often taking more than 
two years to rule on an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Bonin, a truck driver from Downey, prowled the Los Angeles and Orange County 
areas in a van, picking up teen-age boys. He was convicted of strangling them 
and dumping their bodies, usually nude, along the freeways in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
As his trial was about to begin in Los Angeles in 1981, Bonin demanded to 
change lawyers. Prosecutors objected, contending that Bonin was simply seeking 
a delay. They also said Bonin's choice, William H. Charvet, had a potential 
conflict of interest because he had consulted with an accomplice of Bonin who 
was set to testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
When Superior Court Judge William J. Keene asked Bonin to explain why he needed 
a different lawyer, the defendant replied: "Personal vibes." 
</P>
<P>
Though troubled by the request, the judge granted Bonin's wish to retain 
Charvet. A jury found Bonin guilty of 10 Los Angeles County murders and he was 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a new set of lawyers has contended that Bonin's right "to the 
effective assistance of counsel" was violated because Charvet had a conflict of 
interest. They said the lawyer's work was tainted because he had met with the 
accomplice and because he had discussed a book deal with Bonin. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the state Supreme Court rejected this appeal on a 6-1 vote. Justice 
Stanley Mosk said the judge erred by granting Bonin's request without forcing 
him to waive his right to appeal the issue. However, Mosk also concluded that 
the error was harmless, because Charvet had conducted a vigorous defense for 
Bonin, who was later convicted of four murders in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. issued 
an eight-page dissent Monday, saying Bonin deserved a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Bonin stands to be executed, it is imperative that this court ensure 
that he was fairly tried and sentenced," they said. "The Sixth Amendment 
demands that every criminal defendant receive the assistance of a conflict-free 
counsel." 
</P>
<P>
Other Death Row appeals dismissed Monday included those of: 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. McDowell Jr., who killed a maid and stabbed a neighbor in a 
Hollywood Hills robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Lucky, who shot and killed the co-owners of a Los Angeles jewelry 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Eric B. Kimble, who broke into a home in the Doheny Estates area of Los Angeles 
and murdered the couple who lived there. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Bloom Jr., who shot and killed his parents and stabbed his stepsister 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Moore, who fatally stabbed a Long Beach couple who managed the 
apartment complex where Moore once lived. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Robbins, who kidnaped and murdered a 6-year-old San Bernardino County 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Silva, who committed a mutilation murder in San Bernardino County.

DUELING 'CYRANOS' COMPETE IN FRANCE; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: JEAN-PAUL BELMONDO'S STAGE VERSION BEATS OUT GERARD DEPARDIEU'S FILM 
IN REVIVALS OF THE ROSTAND CLASSIC THAT FEATURE ALMOST EVERYTHING THE FRENCH 
HOLD DEAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
When "Cyrano de Bergerac" was first performed on the stage in Paris in 1897, it 
so impressed a government minister in the audience that he summoned the author, 
Edmond Rostand, to his balcony loge during the scene change before the final 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Overcome with the kind of nationalistic fervor that skillful writing sometimes 
engenders here -- not even able to wait until Cyrano died in the arms of Roxane 
to end the play with panache -- the minister removed the Legion d'Honneur medal 
dangling on his own chest and pinned it on the startled Rostand. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, in the name of the President of the Republic, whom I represent on this 
occasion," said the minister, "I dub you a knight of the Legion d'Honneur." 
</P>
<P>
Since that evening at the Theater Porte Saint-Martin, "Cyrano" has been 
performed an estimated 15,000 times in France. Thirty leading French actors 
have played Cyrano here, including Jean-Paul Belmondo in a sold-out new Paris 
stage production, and Gerard Depardieu, in a blockbuster new movie aimed at 
saving the struggling French film industry. 
</P>
<P>
These latest revivals of the play, the story of a brave musketeer-poet cursed 
with a grotesquely huge nose and his love for his cousin, the beautiful Roxane, 
has again stirred the French blood in a way no other work seems to manage. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper columnists bemoan the absence of Cyrano characters in modern French 
politics. Belmondo and Depardieu, two of the best-known French leading actors 
in past decades, duel with each other on the covers of the slick magazines and 
the subway billboards. Government ministers fight for seats at the Theatre 
Marigny, where Belmondo, sword in hand, bounds across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac" has arrived gallantly on the scene during a time of 
national crisis in confidence, this time in the struggling theater and movie 
business, where attendance is down and promoters hope the brave knight of 
Gascogne can save the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac," wrote magazine columnist Jean-Francois Kahn, "opened the 
century with his verve. Now it appears he will close it, just as dashing as 
before. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In France, going to see Rostand's classic play is a veritable rite of passage. 
If the French only see one play on the stage, it is likely to be this one. 
</P>
<P>
It is most often chosen by parents as the introduction to theater for children 
who have outgrown puppet shows in the public parks. Countless actors and 
actresses credit the play with inspiring their decision to go on stage. 
</P>
<P>
So many people know its rhymed Alexandrine verses by heart that patrons often 
have to be reminded not to speak the lines before the actors. 
</P>
<P>
In that regard, going to a stage performance of "Cyrano" like the latest 
starring Belmondo, is a bit like attending a refined version of "Rocky Horror 
Picture Show," with the audience anticipating -- and sometimes participating in 
-- every verse. 
</P>
<P>
In its five acts and 1,400 verses of acrobatic rhyme, "Cyrano" touches on 
practically everything the French hold near and dear. For example, it includes 
extended poetic ballads to the wonders of food, ranging from the tartes of the 
baker Rageneau to the bite-sized bird delicacies known as ortolans. 
</P>
<P>
It has sword fights, food fights, adultery, love poems and long speeches about 
personal honor before wealth and fame that are barely distinguishable from 
political keynote addresses. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the latest revival has sparked plenty of comparisons between Cyrano's 
uncompromising morality and the current flaccid political scene. For many, the 
last honorable man in French politics -- at least by the standards set by 
Cyrano -- was Charles de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the first performance of "Cyrano" in 1897, France was still 
suffering terribly from its defeat by the Prussians in the war of 1870 and the 
carnage of the Paris Commune that followed. 
</P>
<P>
The play was so widely hailed that it has often been credited with reviving the 
French spirit after the 1870 defeat.

"I first went to the play with my sister at the Porte Saint-Martin theater in 
1912," remembered Julien Green, 89, the American author who writes mostly in 
French. "The play was created 15 years before but continued to have enormous 
success. In the eyes of the patriots, it was considered a kind of revenge, in a 
curious way, for the crushing defeat they had against the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the French malaise is centered more in the theater and movie industries. 
In both cases, the elaborate stage production by Robert Hossein, and the movie 
by director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, "Cyrano" is viewed as the potential savior. 
</P>
<P>
According to recently released figures, French cinema houses suffered a 34% 
decline in attendance in 1989. During the same period, American movies shown in 
France registered a 56% increase. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the expensive "Cyrano" production starring Depardieu is the big hope 
to boost the box office. It is at least the fourth time that the play has been 
put on the screen, beginning with an Italian production in 1909. The most 
famous film was probably the 1950 American version with Jose Ferrer, who won an 
Oscar. The latest was the Steve Martin version, "Roxanne," in which the 
comedian played a long-nosed fireman in New England. 
</P>
<P>
The Depardieu movie is the biggest yet attempted, featuring 2,000 actors, 300 
swords, 500 pikes (wielded by Spanish soldiers), 150 muskets, and 10 cannon. 
The movie was filmed in Hungary and France on 40 sets. The creator of 
Depardieu's false noses -- 100 were used during filming -- gets separate 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
But those looking for a classic "Cyrano" may be disappointed. Broad-shouldered 
Depardieu, who also appeared in "The Last Metro," "The Return of Martin Guerre" 
and "Camille Claudel," seems too awkward and bulky for the dashing swordsman he 
is supposed to depict. As the actors sprint from one ostentatiously authentic 
17th-Century scene to another, many of the rhyming verses are lost. 
</P>
<P>
Although not as wounded as the French movie business, the legitimate theater 
also has taken its lumps. According to the Ministry of Culture, the number of 
people attending the five national theaters dropped from 685,000 in 1978 to 
531,000 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Little expanded, little frequented and not very distinctive," a study of the 
theater by the ministry reported. 
</P>
<P>
However, the stage production starring Belmondo is a huge success. The famous 
French actor (star of the Jean-Luc Godard classic, "Breathless") attacks the 
role, mixing bravura with the vulnerability of man wounded by nature. 
</P>
<P>
Belmondo has pledged to play Cyrano on the stage at least until May, and every 
seat at every performance is sold out until that month. Part of the French 
public sympathy for Belmondo in this role is the widely circulated story that 
by playing Cyrano he is fulfilling a long-held wish by his late father, a 
well-known sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
According to director Hossein, with every movie success of Belmondo, the father 
kept asking: "When are you going to return to your true art -- the stage? Am I 
going to die without seeing you in Cyrano?" 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, he did, and that explains to many here why the 56-year-old actor 
accepted the physically testing role. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a nearly suicidal role that you have to jump into with both feet," 
Belmondo said in an interview with Figaro magazine. "It is very tiring. The 
direction of Hossein is very active. But the star is Cyrano, and you must never 
betray him."

NBC DROPS ROCK HUDSON MINISERIES; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: PRODUCERS AND WRITER OF 'AUTHORIZED' STORY SAY THE NETWORK IS 
BASING ITS DECISION ON LACKLUSTER RATINGS FROM AN EARLIER ABC MOVIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The critically panned version of Rock Hudson's life as related in a two-hour 
ABC movie last January may suffice as his television biography of record. NBC 
has decided to drop its plans for a four-hour "authorized" miniseries that has 
been in development for about a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The decision has angered the producers and writer, who charge that NBC was 
reacting to the lackluster ratings for the ABC movie rather than to the quality 
of their script. 
</P>
<P>
NBC denied the allegation. Tony Masucci, NBC senior vice president for movies 
and miniseries, said through a spokeswoman that, "We felt it (the script) 
didn't work well enough conceptually or dramatically to warrant further 
development for a four-hour miniseries." He added that he was hoping for a 
script "as big and compelling as the man." 
</P>
<P>
The NBC spokeswoman pointed out that it's not unusual for a network to drop 
such projects, noting that "70% of the shows in development never get made." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Culver, who wrote the script for the Hudson miniseries and was to have 
co-produced it with Stan Margulies, with whom she had teamed on "The Thorn 
Birds," called Masucci's explanation "a very strange response" inasmuch as he 
never conveyed that reaction to her. Nor had Margulies or co-executive producer 
Ken Kaufman been advised of any script problems. 
</P>
<P>
Margulies, who won Emmys as the producer of "Roots" and "Roots: The Next 
Generations," told on Friday that NBC claimed it was not a ratings decision, 
shot back that "if the network says today is Friday, would you not want to 
check the calendar?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think what it comes down to in television, the determining factor, is who is 
first," Margulies said. "First is more important than accuracy, the 
well-written script, a quality production -- and I think that's what done us 
in. We were second. I mean, I saw the ABC project and, apart from any questions 
of taste -- which we don't have time to go into -- (there's) the question of 
accuracy. I was just appalled at their interpretation of things that I know to 
be otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that is not the issue. They were on the air. They had the benefit of a 
Rock Hudson audience and NBC, despite their protestations, looked at the 
ratings and obviously felt if the first Rock Hudson project only did that, the 
second one will not do as well." 
</P>
<P>
The ABC movie, which aired Jan. 8, was knocked by many critics, attracted only 
a so-so 24% of the audience and suffered some advertiser defections because of 
concern over the depiction of Hudson's homosexuality. The actor had kept that 
part of his life hidden from the public until the end -- when his AIDS was 
revealed. He died in 1985 at age 58. 
</P>
<P>
The movie was produced by Konigsberg/Sanitsky Co., written by Dennis Turner and 
directed by John Nicolella. Major sources for the script were court records on 
a civil suit brought against Hudson by his former lover, Marc Christian, and a 
book by his former wife, Phyllis Gates. (Christian sued the Hudson estate and 
Hudson's longtime secretary, Mark Miller, for emotional stress and won $5.5 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the movie was a supposed plot by Hudson and Miller to keep the 
actor's AIDS a secret from Christian. Miller told Christian in the movie that 
Hudson was afflicted with anorexia. Miller has accused the movie of malicious 
lies. 
</P>
<P>
Culver's script for NBC was based on the authorized biography by Sara Davidson, 
"Rock Hudson: His Story," and considerable research and interviews through the 
cooperation of the Hudson estate. 
</P>
<P>
"ABC decides to do a version dealing with two figures who occupied, I figured 
out, four years of Rock's life, both with enormous axes to grind," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Margulies said that the script was first turned into the network in August and 
"it was the considered opinion of Ken (Kaufman, president of Patchett-Kaufman 
Entertainment), Carmen and myself that the network notes (on proposed changes 
it wanted) were about as few in number that any of us had experienced." 
</P>
<P>
The word filtered down shortly thereafter that ABC was well into its Rock 
Hudson movie and their project went "into limbo," Margulies said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said that Culver had written "a spectacular screenplay" but that NBC 
made "a rational kind of networky decision which says, 'OK, the picture went 
on, it's the same subject matter, it did a 24 share (considered "average"), 
we're going to put a lot of money into a miniseries, should we make essentially 
the same movie?' " 
</P>
<P>
Margulies said that he'll meet with Kaufman to discuss the possibility of 
selling the script to another network or cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
"There was great foreign interest in this project and maybe if that base is 
still there, we can find a way," he said. He maintained that "Rock Hudson was 
the No. 1 international film star for eight consecutive years and, truly, one 
skimpy two-hour movie did not mine the depths of that audience (for a Hudson 
story)." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman agreed. "I think the movie should still be made that illuminates his 
life the way it should be illuminated." I think someday it'll get made. I have 
a lot of confidence in that."

STIFF ABORTION LIMITS BECOME LAW ON GUAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A bill creating the nation's most restrictive abortion statute was signed 
Monday by the territorial governor. The new law was hailed by anti-abortion 
forces, but civil libertarians promised to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, I believe that a fetus is a human being," Republican Gov. Joseph 
Ada said in signing the bill, which prohibits abortion except when the mother's 
health or life is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which was passed despite a ruling by Guam's attorney general that it 
is unconstitutional, makes it a third-degree felony for a person to perform or 
help in an abortion. Seeking or having an abortion or soliciting someone to 
have an abortion is a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
The law provides that the Nov. 6 general election ballot include a referendum 
in which residents of this Pacific Ocean island about 1,500 miles east of the 
Philippines will decide whether to retain the statute. 
</P>
<P>
Guam's 21-member unicameral Legislature unanimously approved the bill on March 
8 after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened in an interview with a television 
reporter to excommunicate any Roman Catholic senator who voted against it. All 
but one of the senators are Catholic, as is Ada. However, most of the senators 
said that they had been unaware of the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Territorial Atty. Gen. Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson issued an opinion on Feb. 26 
holding that the bill is unconstitutional because it violates a woman's 
constitutional right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the abortion debate agree that the new law could provide a direct 
challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 landmark Roe vs. Wade decision 
legalizing abortion on privacy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The new statute cannot coexist with Roe vs. Wade, said Janet Benshoff, director 
of the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Rivera, vice president of the anti-abortion Guamanians United for Life, 
said the law "is the ice pick that's going to chip away at the big block of 
ice" that is Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the Reproductive Freedom Project, said she 
expected immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be either a lawsuit or a negotiated agreement to suspend enforcement 
pending outcome of a lawsuit," Pine said in a telephone interview from her New 
York office. 
</P>
<P>
Among those hailing the new law was the National Right to Life Committee.

POINDEXTER IMAGE GOES FROM JAUNTY TO STEELY

<P>
Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter smiles rarely and takes 
notes often at his Iran-Contra trial. 
</P>
<P>
Because he has not testified yet, the jury must rely a good deal on its mental 
snapshots of his image as he sits at a table opposite them every day. But that 
image poses a riddle. 
</P>
<P>
The balding retired rear admiral has grown a mustache since his days in the 
Ronald Reagan Administration as Oliver L. North's boss. When he takes off his 
glasses, the mustache softens his manner. In fact, it lends him a jaunty, 
sportsman's outdoors look, as if he were a British country squire. 
</P>
<P>
But, when he puts his glasses back on, as he does often to read and take notes, 
his features seem to freeze into stern, steely coldness. The glasses and 
mustache combine to complete a look that recalls the balding, mustached old 
Bolshevik of Stalin's day, V. M. Molotov. 
</P>
<P>
By now, North has fashioned a public image as a Marine of great derring-do and 
energy; a glib patriot who could charm and tongue-tie doubting congressmen with 
ease; a fervent worker who knew how to get things done, no matter what the 
cost; a government official who did not hesitate to speak his mind or change 
dreams into action. He is a hero to many Americans and earns thousands of 
dollars per speech these days. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, with no television cameras present, the jurors in the Poindexter trial 
watched a far different Ollie North for his four days in the witness box. 
Hesitant, forgetful, wearing a puzzled brow, North professed an extraordinary 
failure to remember where he was and what he did on some of the most momentous 
days of his life. He hemmed and hawed about what he did admit remembering. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Dan K. Webb accused North of trying to protect his old boss. Yet 
North's replies were not always helpful to Poindexter. In bringing up the 
charge that Poindexter conspired with North to hide what had happened in the 
Iran-Contra affair, defense attorney Richard W. Beckler asked North: "Do you 
remember Adm. Poindexter saying, 'Let's keep this from Congress?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I do not recall him saying that." 
</P>
<P>
"Because nobody said that, isn't that right?" 
</P>
<P>
"I do not recall what anyone did or did not say." 
</P>
<P>
North sat stiffly upright throughout most of his testimony, frequently asking 
that he be allowed to refresh his memory by consulting his testimony in his own 
trial or to Congress. He would then go through the transcripts methodically, 
his fingers seeking pages almost daintily. 
</P>
<P>
But his memory did manage to eke out some replies when he felt pressed by an 
angry Judge Harold H. Greene or badgered by prosecutor Webb. And, in one moment 
most damaging to Poindexter, he admitted under blistering questioning by Webb 
that, following his old boss's instructions to take care of a group of 
congressmen, he had marched into the White House Situation Room and lied to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom drama starred two federal judges one morning. Judge Greene 
presided, as usual, but a colleague, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, sat 
in the witness box. Sporkin was testifying about his dealings with the White 
House during his days as general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
</P>
<P>
After the oath, Sporkin was asked his occupation. "U.S. district judge," he 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Similar to Judge Greene?" the prosecutor asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Sporkin said, "nobody is similar to Judge Greene. I would like to 
aspire to be Judge Greene." 
</P>
<P>
That drew a pronouncement from Greene: "He's a very truthful witness." 
</P>
<P>
After Sporkin completed his testimony, Greene released him and said: "Next time 
you need a witness to stand in, Judge Sporkin, I will be glad to reciprocate." 
</P>
<P>
But Sporkin looked up to the bench and told Greene: "It's better up there." 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Judge Greene, known best for breaking up the AT&amp;T telephone 
monopoly in a celebrated antitrust case, dominates proceedings. He is somewhat 
avuncular, a pleasant, good-humored jurist who leans back in his chair with an 
elfin slip of a smile on his round face. Yet, if annoyed, he can whip everyone 
back into line with scathing wit. There is no doubt who's in charge in his 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Greene clearly does not like slick lawyers who try to confuse jurors. The judge 
took over the questioning himself when defense attorney Joseph Small drew 
replies from a specialist that made it seem that Adm. Poindexter had used his 
computer for less than a minute on the day he is accused of deleting more than 
5,000 messages from it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to let you mislead the jury," Greene said. His questions then 
established that it may be possible to destroy a multitude of messages in less 
than a minute because computers work so fast that they measure time in 
nanoseconds, otherwise known as split seconds. 
</P>
<P>
There was little doubt that the judge often lost patience with North as a 
witness. "Please just answer the question," he admonished him one day. "For a 
man who quibbles over whether something happened in May rather than June, you 
do embroider other answers. Just answer the question." 
</P>
<P>
At other times, the judge made his point by feigning infinite patience. When 
defense attorney Beckler asked for a few moments delay, Greene retorted: "I 
have a lifetime appointment. If necessary, I can listen to Col. North until my 
term runs out." 
</P>
<P>
The judge has trouble hiding his feelings. When North, whose testimony 
sometimes contradicted testimony he had given elsewhere, said: "All the 
testimony I have given before every tribunal has been accurate and true," 
Green's eyebrows arched noticeably. But he said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, Fawn Hall, Col. North's secretary, was the most glamorous 
figure in the Iran-Contra affair, and she held the attention of every juror as 
she testified in the Poindexter trial. She is a thin, very pale young woman 
with a bounty of long blond hair like that of the medieval princesses in the 
illustrations for old Sir Walter Scott novels. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking so rapidly that the judge had to slow her down to let the court 
reporter catch up, Hall told her well-known tale of helping North shred and 
steal government documents as authorities closed in on him at the end of the 
Iran-Contra affair. Also, she delivered a few rapid-fire tributes to the 
patriotism of her old boss. 
</P>
<P>
After she had completed her testimony, Judge Greene told her that she would no 
longer be needed at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"You're free to do whatever you want," he said, "within reason."

NASA disputed a report Monday that a planned $30-billion space station is 
seriously flawed because it would begin to wear out and require extensive 
maintenance before it is completed. 
</P>
<P>
William Lenoir, associate administrator for space flight for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said problems outlined in a story in the 
New York Times and repeated in the Los Angeles Times are not new and will be 
overcome once the proposed station, called Freedom, reaches the construction 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Lenoir said questions about the space station's durability 
"apparently result from a worst-case scenario that NASA used in a normal risk 
analysis assessment during the station's preliminary design phase." 
</P>
<P>
"This scenario is not considered credible," he said, adding that scientists 
assume "unrealistically pessimistic" conditions to make sure the space station 
can withstand the rigors of orbiting Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, citing NASA sources, said anticipated maintenance problems could 
force a redesign of the 400-foot-long station, which is the centerpiece of the 
U.S. space program in the 1990s and beyond.

LIBYA SUSPECTS INSIDER IN PLANT FIRE, REPORTS ARRESTS

Libya has detained several people in connection with a fire at a suspected 
poison gas factory and will execute on the site of the blaze anyone found 
responsible for it, Libya's ambassador to Italy said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Rahman Shalgam said sabotage designed to look like an accident was 
responsible for the fire last Wednesday at the chemical plant at Rabta, 60 
miles southwest of Tripoli, the Libyan capital. 
</P>
<P>
"Several people under suspicion have been detained," Shalgam told a news 
conference in Rome. He did not specify nationality. 
</P>
<P>
He said an investigation so far indicates that "a member of the plant's 
technical staff" had started the fire, which he said caused "damages of great 
proportion." 
</P>
<P>
He said that although Libya "is against the death penalty," the person 
responsible for the incident "will be executed at the spot where the fire 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Libya denies that the plant was making chemical weapons, as charged by the 
United States, and says it manufactured medicines. 
</P>
<P>
Shalgam said Libya suspects that West Germany played a "technical" part in 
starting the blaze since it had a large role in building the plant. 
</P>
<P>
But in Paris on Monday, operators of a satellite that took pictures of the 
plant said there appeared to be little damage. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Brachet, president of French satellite operator Spot-Images, which 
photographed the plant, said: "The images do not indicate any trace of a fire 
in the main factory. The roofs are intact." 
</P>
<P>
However, the French satellite is not believed to be as capable of defining 
damage as are American satellites.

Oskar Lafontaine, the 46-year-old premier of the depressed West German state of 
Saarland, was chosen Monday to lead the opposition Social Democratic Party in 
the election for chancellor against incumbent Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine was named in a secret party ballot only a day after the allied 
Social Democrats of East Germany were badly beaten by a center-right coalition 
of parties aligned with Kohl's Christian Democrats in the first free elections 
in that nation. 
</P>
<P>
The West German national elections are scheduled for December. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine has been the opposition's leading candidate since January, when he 
easily won reelection over the Christian Democrats to the premiership in the 
coal-and-steel state along the French border. 
</P>
<P>
On a personal basis, the intellectually inclined Lafontaine tops Kohl in public 
opinion polls, but his party is running only even with the ruling Christian 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
When the exodus of East Germans to West Germany began last fall, Lafontaine won 
widespread attention, and some support, by arguing that the federal republic 
could not easily underwrite all the newcomers and calling for them to remain at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
However, the other major parties quickly took up this position and Lafontaine 
could no longer claim it as his own. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he has lately been urging a gradual transition to German unity instead 
of the faster pace pushed by Kohl -- which was apparently supported by East 
Germans in Sunday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said Monday that he is in favor of a "cautious transition" to a 
common currency with East Germany while ensuring that a social welfare net 
remains in place. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the issue of European security that brings him into sharpest conflict 
with Kohl's Christian Democrats and with the members of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
At various times, Lafontaine has called NATO an "anachronism" and advocated 
that a united Germany leave NATO's military structure while remaining 
politically bound to it. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he hedged, calling for a "European security system that should come 
from military cooperation," adding that his aim is "to overcome the 
confrontation between the blocs and create a European system to replace 
existing military alliances." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a meeting of the Socialist Party in France, Lafontaine suggested an 
"all-European defense," which he said would consist of both NATO and Warsaw 
Pact troops under a joint command. 
</P>
<P>
"Armies under a common high command can hardly march against one another," he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
This is an idea that puts him at odds with NATO allies and a large body of 
current West German opinion, as well as some leaders of his own party.

<P>
In an unprecedented wave of murders, 59 Soviet military officers ranging in 
rank from lieutenant to general were slain last year, a military affairs 
newsletter said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter, published by the respected Jane's Information Group, said the 
murders "appear to be part of the current move of antipathy felt toward the 
armed forces, particularly among younger age groups in ethnic regions." 
</P>
<P>
By way of contrast, it said that in 1988 two Soviet officers were murdered and 
in 1987 just one. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few (of the murders) have been solved," and Soviet authorities are 
disturbed that local law enforcement agencies "are either incapable of or not 
interested in carrying out any proper line of inquiry," the newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
It cited the case of Lt. Igor Kholostyakov, stabbed 14 times while returning to 
his unit one night. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of Lt. Kholostyakov, the police official arrived to 'survey the 
scene' . . . that was nine months ago; since then, nothing further has been 
done to bring the murderer(s) to justice," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It said a special section has been set up in the top military prosecutor's 
office to work with local police and law offices. New security guidelines are 
being drawn up to protect military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The murders come against a backdrop of rapidly rising crime in the Soviet Union 
and ethnic unrest in various republics.

ITALIAN WINE WITH FUNGICIDE BARRED BY FDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two shipments of Asti Spumante have been barred from the United States since 
tests found that the wine contains a chemical not approved for use in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration discovered the presence of the fungicide 
Procymidone during routine testing of the Italian wine earlier this month. It 
barred two shipments of Tosti, the second-best-selling Asti Spumante in the 
United States, from entering the country, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said it would test about 200 shipments of wine over the next month for 
Procymidone as well as other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Carnevale, associate director of the contaminants policy staff at the 
FDA in Rockville, Md., said the agency had ordered tests by the multi-residue 
method, "to test for much more than Procymidone." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the multi-residue test was being ordered, in part, because, "We 
don't look at very much wine. We usually test produce, rather than finished 
products" for chemical residues. 
</P>
<P>
She added that over the years when wine has been tested, "we find things in it, 
but not anything of regulatory significance." 
</P>
<P>
Procymidone is a commercial product used to prevent development of mold on 
grapes, Carnevale said. It is commonly used throughout Europe but is not used 
in the United States and thus is not generally regarded as safe for human 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Because tolerance levels for Procymidone have not been established here, no 
amount of it in any product for human consumption is allowed. Carnevale said 
that any chemical found in any product at a level above 0.02 parts per million 
would be refused U.S. entry. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Maxwell, president of the Washington-based National Assn. of Beverage 
Importers, said that Procymidone, manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. of 
Osaka, Japan, is widely used around the world to prevent mold on grapes "and 
there are authorized residual tolerances in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
"FDA has not advised me that the presence of trace amounts (of Procymidone) 
carries any health risk, but (importers' association) has sent product-alert 
memos to our members to say that Procymidone is not certified for use in the 
United States and because of that, the FDA has no established tolerance levels 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for a European trade organization, who requested anonymity, said 
that Procymidone was "under strong control all over Europe." He said the 
chemical, in trace amounts, "is not considered dangerous," but he didn't know 
what tolerances were acceptable in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Tosti is imported by Tyfield Importers of Troy, Mich. Tyfield President Milford 
Lewis, through a spokesman, refused to be interviewed on the subject and 
referred callers to Maxwell of the beverage importers' group. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said that tests for chemical residues would be conducted in seven port 
cities -- Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia 
and Orlando, Fla.

REPORT WARNS OF 'SUPERWEEDS' CREATION; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: A COALITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SAYS THAT GENETIC ENGINEERING 
TO INDUCE HERBICIDE-RESISTANT CROPS AND TREES POSES DANGERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The genetic engineering of herbicide-resistant crops and trees is a dangerous 
technology that could lead to increased pesticide use and groundwater pollution 
and create "superweeds," a coalition of environmental groups contended in a 
report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the Biotechnology Working Group urged the federal government to 
stop funding the research and development of advanced-technology pesticides 
because of their potential dangers. The group, a committee of 18 environmental, 
farm, church and consumer organizations, released its study at press 
conferences in Washington, St. Paul, Minn., and Davis, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The study identifies 27 companies and 21 public universities and research 
centers, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, that are conducting 
plant breeding and biotechnology research to create crops and forest trees that 
are genetically tolerant of chemical herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of this research is "so that you can spray more pesticides," said 
Michael Picker, West Coast director of the National Toxics Campaign Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The development of such plants, the group said, would allow farmers to apply 
herbicides liberally, killing weeds and other unwanted plants without fear of 
adverse effects on their host crop. In addition to the danger of poisonous 
runoff and other contamination, the group said, herbicide-resistant 
"superweeds" may mutate from the genetically engineered host plants via 
cross-pollination. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the group promoted a bill to be presented this week by Sen. 
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) that would cut the $10.8 million spent annually on 
herbicide-tolerance research. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also shift the funds to a program that develops a holistic 
approach to farming, including the rotation and diversification of crops, which 
in some cases have proven effective in controlling weed growth without chemical 
sprays. That program has received about $4.4 million a year since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"USDA's research policy on herbicide-resistant plants is short-sighted and 
misguided," said Leahy, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put our scientists to work helping farmers grow more with less 
herbicides, instead of helping chemical companies sell more herbicides." 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously in Davis, Calif., another press conference was held outside the 
offices of Calgene Inc., a biotechnology firm trying to develop a cotton seed 
tolerant to the French-manufactured herbicide bromoxynil. 
</P>
<P>
Zachary S. Wozhok, Calgene's president and chief operating officer, dismissed 
the group's report as "grandstanding" and "filled with unfounded statements." 
</P>
<P>
"The extreme of their argument could be that all chemicals are bad," said 
Wozhok, who emphasized that his company's emphasis is on technological advances 
that can reduce the use of pesticides. "I don't know where agriculture would be 
today without chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, herbicide-tolerant crops 
could have a major impact on California's $16-billion farming industry, which 
consumes up to half of the nation's pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the world's largest pesticide manufacturers are conducting 
herbicide-tolerant research. They already control about 70% of the world's 
profit from pesticide sales and spent the 1980s gaining control of seed 
companies, vying for a share of a potentially massive market. The eight 
companies are the United States' DuPont, Dow/Elanco and Monsanto, plus the 
European firms Ciba-Geigy, ICI, Rhone-Poulenc, Hoechst and Bayer. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Goldhammer, director of technical affairs for the Industrial Biotechnology 
Assn., asserted that the EPA can be counted on to safeguard the public from 
exposure to potentially toxic chemicals, and that the industry is only 
providing its customers a wider choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The farmers can either buy the seeds or not buy the seeds, buy the chemicals 
or not buy the chemicals," Goldhammer said. "The market is going to determine 
the ultimate acceptance of the product."

COURT ALLOWS LOGGING EXEMPTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: JUSTICES LET STAND OPINION THAT PERMITS HARVESTING OF OLD-GROWTH 
FORESTS. ACTION IS A BLOW TO THOSE SEEKING TO SAVE THE NORTHERN SPOTTED OWL.

<P>
Avoiding a bitter environmental fight in the Pacific Northwest, the U.S. 
Supreme Court let stand Monday an appeals court ruling that threw out a key 
argument in lawsuits seeking to block harvesting of ancient forests. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, declined to review a ruling by the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals last September against the Audubon Society and the 
Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in a series of lawsuits aimed at restricting 
logging on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental groups had argued that government plans to allow logging of 
virgin, or old-growth, public forests were illegal because they had failed to 
consider new information about how such activity might hasten the extinction of 
the northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law usually forbids federal agencies to take actions that threaten 
species with extinction. But a recent temporary congressional exemption allows 
the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to implement plans 
they have already adopted even if new evidence indicates that those plans may 
push some species closer to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows them to put on environmental blinders when dealing with these 
outdated plans," said Vic Sher, a lawyer for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Sher said a federal court judge in Seattle had ruled last year that the Bureau 
of Land Management was "arbitrary and capricious" in ignoring "new, significant 
and probably accurate information about the potential extinction of the 
northern spotted owl." 
</P>
<P>
But Sher added that the judge felt she was unable to force the bureau to 
rewrite its logging plans because of the exemption granted by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary exemption was added onto annual appropriations bills for the 
Forest Service and land management bureau by timber state legislators who 
feared that protecting the spotted owl and other species might cost the jobs of 
thousands of forest-products workers. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups have been challenging federal timber harvest practices 
from California to the Canadian border, arguing that cutting plans threaten to 
destroy irreplaceable old-growth forests and wipe out several species of 
animals and plants that depend on them. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rutzick, a Portland, Ore., lawyer who represents the Northwest Forest 
Resources Council, said Monday's ruling was an important victory for loggers. 
But he said its long-term implications are unclear because the land management 
bureau has begun reviewing the impact that logging has on threatened species. 
Logging continues while the study is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Rutzick added that a more important fight will start April 3, when both sides 
are scheduled to open arguments in a lawsuit over a broad compromise Congress 
enacted last year. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, pushed by timber state lawmakers led by Sen. Mark O. Hatfield 
(R-Ore.), sought to balance the needs of nature with the needs of the region's 
timber-based economy. Over the objection of several top environmental groups, 
it authorizes temporary harvests somewhat below traditional levels and forbids 
most legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists contend that the peculiar language in the compromise law 
actually lets loggers cut down more trees this year than in the past.

1976 MOVIE SPARKS EQUAL TIME DEMANDS 
</P>

A candidate running for Congress in Riverside County on Monday asked KCBS 
Channel 2 to give him equal time after the station aired a film early Sunday 
starring Ralph Waite, who also is seeking the seat. Another candidate said he 
planned to make the same request. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Pearson, who is running against Waite for the Democratic nomination in 
the 37th Congressional District, contacted the CBS-owned station after it 
broadcast "The Secret Life of John Chapman" from 4 to 6 a.m. Sunday. The 1976 
made-for-television movie starred Waite as a college president who took a 
sabbatical to become a ditch-digger and short-order cook. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received a call from (Pearson) and are evaluating the request," KCBS 
spokeswoman Lisa DeLucia said. "We schedule so far in advance (that) we were 
not aware that (Waite) was running for office." 
</P>
<P>
Waite, best known for his role as the patriarch in "The Waltons," which ran on 
CBS from 1972-1981, announced his candidacy March 7. DeLucia said that the 
station prepares its schedule a month to six weeks in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Jacobs, who also is seeking the Democratic nomination, said that he 
plans to ask for equal time too. Under federal regulations, TV stations must 
provide equal time to opposing candidates whenever a candidate who has 
qualified for the ballot appears on a broadcast outside of bona fide newscasts, 
interview programs, documentaries or spot coverage of news events. 
</P>
<P>
Waite could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Similar cases in the past have resulted in competing candidates being given an 
amount of air time equal to the time that the actor/candidate actually appeared 
on screen, not for the entire broadcast in which he appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent actor to be affected by the equal time law was former 
President Ronald Reagan, whose movies were kept off the air during his 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strictest interpretation of the law came when George Takei sought a 
Los Angeles City Council seat in 1973. KNBC Channel 4 refrained from showing 
animated versions of "Star Trek," which included him supplying the voice of Mr. 
Sulu. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Democratic primary in the 37th Congressional District is 
expected to face four-term incumbent Rep. Al McCandless (R-La Quinta) in 
November's general election. McCandless is expected to easily win renomination 
in the June 5 primary.

CARTER SUSPENDED FROM PROXY-SOLICITING FIRM AFTER CONFESSION REPORT 
</P>

Donald C. Carter, who turned the dull world of proxy solicitations into a 
business as boisterous and tough as the Brooklyn streets he grew up on, was 
suspended Monday from the company that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
VPI Group, the British parent company of the Carter Organization, suspended 
Carter after he announced in a newspaper article that he plans to plead guilty 
later this week to two felony counts of grand larceny and tax evasion. Carter 
reportedly said he overcharged clients by $1 million and charged some personal 
expenses to his company. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's legal problems were no secret to the parent company. Indeed, VPI says 
it has been cooperating with an 18-month-old investigation by the New York 
State Organized Crime Task Force into Carter's alleged improprieties. But VPI 
officials were miffed that Carter failed to warn them about his unofficial 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that we did not anticipate," said Angus Maitland, VPI's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who could not be reached for comment, reportedly said he would enter 
his guilty plea at a New York state court but gave no specific location or 
date. His attorney, Robert Gold, was unavailable to confirm the report, 
published Monday in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Carter had already been removed as chief executive of the company in January 
and was kept on to handle only one client, Sea Containers America, Maitland 
said. VPI may consider suing Carter for damages incurred by his alleged 
misdeeds, Maitland added. 
</P>
<P>
When Carter opened his firm in 1975, proxy solicitations were a backwater of 
the financial world. Carter charged a modest $25,000 for overseeing shareholder 
votes at annual corporate meetings and trying to sway shareholders to vote for 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
But the takeover boom of the 1980s put increased importance on proxy 
solicitations, and the flamboyant Carter was the first, and many say the best, 
at exploiting the opportunity. By 1988, his company was charging as much as $1 
million to advise a client in a proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was not known for modesty. He drove a red Bentley with the license plate 
PROXY. He once told the Los Angeles Times that when companies started thinking 
about boardroom warfare, "The call goes first to me -- not to the lawyers, the 
investment bankers -- but to me." 
</P>
<P>
Carter made his biggest killing in June, 1987, when he sold his company for 
more than $75 million to VPI, a British communications firm. Carter said then 
he planned to stay on indefinitely as the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's fortunes started sagging in 1988 when it lost proxy battles for 
several high-profile customers. Client Coniston Group lost a bid to take over 
Gillette Co., client Bank of New York lost to Irving Trust, and client Burt 
Sugarman lost a bid for Media General. In the Irving Trust case, a large block 
of proxy votes were lost and allegations surfaced that another proxy card was 
altered. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, the Organized Crime Task Force began looking into Carter's 
personal taxes and allegations that the firm was padding bills to clients. 
Maitland said the company has since installed a computerized billing system. 
</P>
<P>
Problems at the Carter Organization and the general cooling in corporate 
takeovers battered VPI's earnings. The company's pretax profits slipped 54% to 
6,487 British pounds in 1989, compared to the previous year. VPI stock, traded 
on the London Stock Exchange, dropped 1.5 pence to close Monday at 23 pence. It 
had sold for as much as 270 pence before VPI bought the Carter Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Maitland said he fears no repercussions from Carter's announcement, although 
company officials did spend most of the day calling to reassure clients, which 
include Xerox, Goodyear Tire, Sony and Texas Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
John Wilcox, managing director of rival Georgeson &amp; Co., said Carter's 
problems could well hurt the Carter Organization. He said his company, which 
along with Carter and D. F. King &amp; Co. are the three largest proxy 
solicitors, has picked up about six Carter clients since Carter was removed 
from executive duties in January.

BANK OF JAPAN HIKES DISCOUNT RATE IN WAKE OF NIKKEI'S SHARP DROP 
</P>

<P>
The Bank of Japan today announced a long-awaited increased in its central 
discount rate -- a 1-percentage point hike to 5.25% -- in the wake of the Tokyo 
stock market's fourth major plunge in less than a month and another major drop 
in the yen's value. 
</P>
<P>
The large move, which had been expected since stocks and the yen started 
plunging in value after a Feb. 18 general election, was taken to "forestall 
inflation," the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
Word that the bank's policy committee was meeting pulled up prices on the stock 
market even before the announcement was made shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index, which plunged 1,353.20 points Monday, recovered 
ground to end the morning down 156.67 points, or 0.5%, at 31,106.57. The index, 
which had been down as much as 693.16 points in the morning session, recovered 
further in early afternoon trading and was down only 15.23 points at 31,248.01. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's loss, which shaved 4.15% of the value of average stock prices, was the 
third largest in points in the market's history and marked the fourth time in 
the last month that the market had suffered a massive setback, bringing the 
year's pullback to almost 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The yen, which dropped 1.05 points in value Monday to finish at 153.55 yen to 
the dollar, regained 0.65 point to finish morning trading today at 152.90 yen. 
Monday's closing marked the first time in two years and eight months that the 
dollar had traded for more than 153 yen. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time since last May that the bank had increased the rate at 
which it loans funds to commercial institutions, and was the largest of the 
four increases. Until May, the central discount rate had been 2.5%, a 
post-World War II low. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the move during the trading day also was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said he expected the bank's action to help 
stabilize both stock prices and the yen-dollar exchange rates, which, he said, 
had been moving "without regard to the real economy." He called the move 
timely. 
</P>
<P>
Before the central bank announced its decision, pessimism pervaded the market. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the most bearish weekly strategy meeting I've ever had this morning," 
said Andrew Ballingal, senior manager of the equities department at Barclays de 
Zoete Wedd in Japan. "I don't see anything in the domestic context or the 
external context to turn things around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said heavy computer sell programs contributed to the loss. Talk that 
some speculators had run into financial trouble and were unloading shares also 
unnerved the market. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts noted that the presence of the same bearish factors that have 
plagued the market since the start of this year: prospects of a weaker yen, 
higher interest rates, slower corporate profit growth and higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Such worries have lopped almost 20% off the Nikkei since the index ended 1989 
at a record high of 38,915.87. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, in point terms, the Nikkei has suffered six of its 10 worst 
drops. It plunged 1,569.10 points Feb. 26, its second-biggest one-day point 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
In percentage terms, Monday's slide wasn't one of the market's top 10 declines, 
but it did smash through a key psychological mark. 
</P>
<P>
"The fall today was really severe for the market," said Setsuo Watanuki, a 
trader at Toyo Securities. "It seemed to have ripped through its resistance 
line." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 153.55 yen and 1.6873 West German marks Monday, versus 
152.62 yen and 1.6990 marks at Friday's New York close. It was the dollar's 
highest close in Tokyo since March 12, 1987, when it closed at 153.69 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets in Tokyo since January had expected the Bank of Japan to 
raise the discount rate to defend the yen and curb inflation. The central bank 
had not done so, partly due to opposition from the finance ministry, which 
worries that a rise would hurt the economy, and partly due to fears that a hike 
would damage stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Global interest rates have been rising in reaction to the demand for capital to 
cope with events in Eastern Europe and the unification of Germany in 
particular. This trend, combined with the view of many market experts that 
Tokyo share prices remain technically overvalued, gives stock market players 
little hope. 
</P>
<P>
"In their hearts, people don't think the market will rebound," Yasushi 
Sakamoto, a fund manager at Toyo Trust &amp; Banking, said before the central 
bank announced its move. "Looking at the longer term, expectations for stock 
market growth are not very high." 
</P>
<P>
The pessimism has largely stayed inside Japan's borders, however, since the 
country's stock market has long been viewed as overvalued in comparison with 
other world markets. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British markets both weakened a bit in reaction to Tokyo. But West 
German stocks surged 2% Monday in response to the country's historic elections 
won by parties favoring unification of the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
The Sydney stock market closed firmer despite Tokyo's steep declines. The All 
Ordinaries index rose 15.2 points to 1,599.7. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stocks closed softer in see-saw trading on a widespread market belief 
that interest rates will go higher. The Hang Seng index fell 6.35 points to 
2,886.46, above an intraday low of 2,869 but compared to a high of 2,906.

Brazil Bans Challenges to Reform: President Fernando Collor de Mello banned 
legal challenges to his tough anti-inflation plan, which freezes at least $110 
billion in bank accounts for the next 18 months. In a decree published in the 
official government gazette, Collor de Mello prohibited legal challenges to the 
freeze, which ties up most of Brazil's money for the next 18 months.

PLAN FOR FLUSHABLE DIAPERS IS ALL WET, CRITICS CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move bound to increase squalling over disposable versus cloth diapers, an 
Arizona company has announced plans to manufacture a flushable disposable 
plastic diaper. 
</P>
<P>
RMED International, a Sedona, Ariz., distributor of TenderCare disposable 
diapers to such retailers as Mrs. Gooch's health food supermarkets, plans to 
have its diaper-making machine in place and to produce almost 100,000 a day by 
May. 
</P>
<P>
The diaper can be flushed into sewage systems, company spokesmen say, because 
its new bikini shape uses 40% less material than other disposables and it is 
lined with a plastic mixed with chalk. The chalk, says the company, will break 
down in the acid normally found in sewage systems. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists generally favor a return to reusable cloth diapers because 
manufacturers of disposable diapers -- even those labeled degradable -- have 
been unable to produce convincing research to show that they are harmless to 
the environment. The disposables now end up in landfills; the new flushables 
would end up in sewage treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense in putting extra strain on already stressed-out sewage 
systems," said Lisa Collaton, of the Environmental Action Foundation's solid 
waste alternatives project. "It's clearly an attempt to hold onto their part of 
the disposable diaper market. . . . These companies are running wild trying to 
find ways to stay in the market." 
</P>
<P>
And there are solid indications that the disposable diaper industry is in deep 
trouble. The National Assn. of Diaper Services reported a whopping 39% increase 
nationwide from 1988 to 1989 in customers using cloth diapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Flushable diapers only transfer the problem from one source to another," 
Arthur Saarinen, president of the Water Pollution Control Federation, a trade 
group of waste water treatment plant operators and engineers, wrote to a trade 
publication recently. "The sludge from many treatment plants goes to landfills 
for disposal (anyway). . . . We will take the contents, but not the packaging." 
</P>
<P>
Even Ecological Engineering Inc., a small waste water system-consulting firm 
testing the new diapers, is less than enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"I like people who try to solve problems," said Susan Peterson, president of 
Ecological Engineering, "but if I had a septic system, I wouldn't use them." 
</P>
<P>
Neither would Peterson welcome flushable diapers if she ran a municipal sewer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could devise a flushable diaper in which all components broke down to 
carbon dioxide and water, that would be great," she said. "They are part way 
there."

EGG CITY PARTNERS HURL A SCRAMBLE OF CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: A LEGAL FEUD IS RAGING AS THE MOORPARK RANCH CLAIMS ITS JAPANESE 
PARTNER, OKURA &amp; CO., CONSPIRED TO TAKE IT OVER. OKURA DENIES IT. 
</P>

<P>
In March, 1989, Richard Carrott received a letter from his Japanese partner in 
Egg City, a Moorpark egg ranch. The partner, a division of the Japanese Okura 
&amp; Co., says it loaned Egg City about $30 million and helped the ranch climb 
out of bankruptcy, but Carrott wasn't feeling very good about his relationship 
with the group. Not long before, he had had some angry exchanges with some 
Okura executives at Egg City. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the letter, which Carrott says made him feel as one would at 
that moment in a failing marriage when one realizes that "things just weren't 
like they always were before." 
</P>
<P>
"Do not move, as mountain does not," wrote Hiroshi Toyokawa, president of 
Okura's American subsidiary, quoting a Japanese shogun in the letter to 
Carrott. "Stay quiet, as forest is always so." Then Toyokawa added, more 
sternly: "You and (Carrott's other partner) Mr. Rosen have been trying my 
patience." 
</P>
<P>
Carrott says he considered the letter a threat. "I was floored," says Carrott, 
who owns 54% of the Careau Group, the company that operates Egg City. 
</P>
<P>
But R. DeWitt Kirwan, Okura's attorney, laughs at the mention of Toyokawa's 
letter, saying it was fatherly advice from a seasoned executive. The note, he 
says, was centered on Toyokawa's suggestion that Carrott should avoid being 
"angry or nervous or emotional very often." 
</P>
<P>
It has been hard for either side to be calm recently. Each has sued the other 
in U.S. District Court. In February, Okura, the Japanese company that owns 40% 
of Egg City, sued to foreclose, saying Careau defaulted on $30 million in 
loans. Next, Careau, under Carrott's control, two weeks ago countersued Okura 
for $72.5 million in damages, claiming that the Japanese trading company set 
out secretly to acquire Egg City "at a fraction of its true value" by forcing 
Okura into default and taking control as part of an elaborate business 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
The case isn't likely to come to trial before the end of the year, but attorney 
Kirwan says, "It's a simple vanilla collection action." 
</P>
<P>
Careau's attorney, A. Barry Cappello, counters that it's a story of "insidious 
business practices by a Japanese trading company." 
</P>
<P>
The case pits Kirwan, a fairly staid attorney with the downtown law firm 
Lillick &amp; McHose, against Cappello, a flamboyant Santa Barbara lawyer known 
for his work in "lender liability" cases, much like the Egg City case, in which 
borrowers claim that the lenders have defrauded them or interfered with 
business. Cappello won a $37-million judgment -- later overturned -- in one of 
the earliest and best-known lender liability cases, claiming that Bank of 
America forced some Sonoma County apple growers out of business by calling 
loans too early. 
</P>
<P>
Lender liability cases have multiplied in recent years. But while the cases 
have increased in frequency, they have become harder to win, according to Hal 
Scott, a professor at Harvard Law School. "The appellate courts have cut back 
severely on judgments issued in lower courts, and I think the trend is to limit 
the liability of lenders," Scott says. 
</P>
<P>
The roots of the case trace back to chronic financial problems at Egg City, 
once the world's largest egg farm with 3.5 million chickens, according to 
"Guinness Book of World Records." Egg City was losing about $300,000 a month 
before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1986, Carrott says. 
Careau acquired the ranch in 1985 in a $19-million leveraged buyout from Kroger 
Co., the Cincinnati-based grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the United Farm Workers Union launched a strike against Egg City after 
the ranch filed for protection from its creditors. Carrott claimed that Egg 
City's losses at the time stemmed from labor costs and asked the bankruptcy 
judge to approve a $2-an-hour wage cut. The judge granted the decrease over the 
UFW's objections, but the strike went on, leading to boycotts of wholesalers 
and restaurants that bought Egg City eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in late 1987, Okura, which had been buying millions of dollars worth 
of eggs each year from Egg City, reached an agreement with Carrott under which 
it would loan Careau $13 million to pay off creditors and come out of 
bankruptcy, in exchange for a 40% stake in the ranch. Okura says it lent Careau 
the money to keep the ranch going as a reliable source of eggs for the trading 
company. Okura also sent two executives to work at Egg City and sit on its 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Okura soon lent even more money to Careau -- a total of about $30 million, 
Okura claims -- to upgrade the ranch and keep it operating. Okura now complains 
that Egg City is $19.8 million behind in principal and interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
While the lawsuit is being sorted out, Careau maintains that Egg City has been 
making a profit since October and isn't falling further into debt, as Okura 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of Careau's countersuit against Okura is that the Japanese company 
structured their investment from the start in a way that guaranteed Careau 
would eventually default on the loans and forfeit Egg City to Okura. 
</P>
<P>
Their evidence against Okura starts with a memo dated about a month after the 
original deal with Okura, in January, 1988. The memo between Okura officials 
discusses the possibility of foreclosing on the $13-million loan almost 
immediately after signing the deal, according to Careau's complaint, but 
dismisses the possibility because "even third parties would probably believe 
that Okura contrived the takeover." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Kirwan says the memo discussed a number of possibilities for dealing 
with new demands for loans at Egg City and maintains that the fact that Okura 
didn't try to foreclose at the time is proof of the Japanese company's good 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
Careau's suit also claims that the Japanese group coerced him into agreeing to 
the loan in the first place by delaying negotiations until he had no other 
choice but to sign. Kirwan denies the charge. Careau even alleges that when 
Carrott went to sign the deal in December, 1987, he was forced to sign blank 
pages so he wouldn't know that the terms of the deal had secretly been changed. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirwan says the papers were on hand at the signing and everything in them 
had been discussed and negotiated for months. 
</P>
<P>
Carrott also blames much of Egg City's troubles since early 1988 on Okura. For 
instance, he claims that Okura forced Egg City to sell a large amount of egg 
products to Q. P. Corp., a good customer of Okura's, for below production 
costs, causing Egg City a loss of up to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kirwan denies that Okura pressured Careau into the contract and says the 
set-price, egg-buying deal with Q. P. was a good one when it was struck, but 
egg prices started to climb in late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Careau's suit also claims that Okura's two representatives at Egg City dealt 
behind Carrott's back. It claims that the March, 1989, letter from Toyokawa 
containing the shogun's advice followed Carrott's discovery that the two 
Japanese executives were preparing secret financial reports for Okura about Egg 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Kirwan says, however, that the letter stemmed from a disagreement about whether 
Egg City should reimburse Carrott for $821,000 in expenses. A 1985 employment 
contract called for the company to make the reimbursements, but Carrott hadn't 
included them on the books during Careau's bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Careau's suit also claims that Okura cost Egg City potential profits by 
negotiating, along with Q. P. Corp., to buy a stake in a major Midwest egg 
producer late last summer. In January, Q. P. Corp. acquired a 56% stake in 
Henningsen Foods without Okura's involvement, which Careau claims makes both 
Okura and Q. P. "direct competitors of Egg City." 
</P>
<P>
But Okura decided not to invest in the other egg producer to avoid any such 
claim of conflict, according to Okura's attorney. And Kirwan says the 
Henningsen deal wouldn't have hurt Egg City, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Careau's attorney Cappello claims that incident is more complex than it seems 
-- and that the case, too, is far more complex than the usual foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Says Cappello: "I'm not going to let them file some simple little pleading 
saying it's just a loan and that's all."

Unocal Chairman Backs Boost in Gas Tax: Richard Stegemeier said Congress should 
consider hiking gasoline taxes as a way to pay for cleaning up the environment 
or upgrading transportation. "It's well known that gasoline taxes in the United 
States are ridiculously low compared to the rest of the world," he said at the

PEOPLE: MOMMY TRACK STIGMA STILL DOGS SCHWARTZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK GLADSTONE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly three decades of bushwhacking trails for women in the 
male-dominated workplace, Felice N. Schwartz has spent much of the past year 
fighting accusations she is a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't capitulated. On the contrary, the dispute with some influential 
feminists seems to have sharpened. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz is the founder of a prominent corporate consulting firm in Manhattan 
called Catalyst, which promotes sexual equality at work and which was spawned 
during the feminist movement of the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
It now is one of the leading advisers on women's issues to large American 
businesses. Schwartz's connections give her access to the heads of companies 
ranging from Citibank to Sara Lee Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Schwartz hurtled herself into the public eye by writing a widely read 
article that became associated with the buzzword mommy track, though she didn't 
invent the term and has repudiated it many times. 
</P>
<P>
She asserted in the article, titled "Management Women and the New Facts of 
Life," that women's growing role in the work force has forced companies to 
become more responsive and sensitive to their needs to attract and retain the 
most talented. 
</P>
<P>
But the article, published in the January-February 1989 issue of Harvard 
Business Review, created an uproar among women. It was perceived as 
distinguishing two paths for management women, a fast one for the strictly 
career-driven and childless and a slower dead-end route for those who want to 
raise families. 
</P>
<P>
Other well-known women activists quickly distanced themselves from Schwartz and 
accused her of giving companies an excuse to put women down after many years of 
steady advances. 
</P>
<P>
They said her assertions amounted to a stark choice between career and family, 
reinforced sexual stereotypes and assumed the burden of child-rearing remained 
strictly a woman's domain. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, a 65-year-old grandmother and tough-talking corporate executive in 
her own right, has rejected those accusations, blaming them partly on 
misunderstandings and distortions of her position. 
</P>
<P>
She has faced the criticism with a mixture of defiance, anguish, frustration 
and humility, debating her feminist adversaries and articulating her position 
hundreds of times in speeches and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of that article was to encourage corporate leaders to make 
progress in assimilating women at every level of management and to remove 
barriers to their advancement," she said at a conference in January, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote of the need for employers to revise their thinking, their policies and 
their practices in order to meet the needs of employees who choose to combine 
work and family." 
</P>
<P>
Having to explain herself more than a year later shows how difficult the mommy 
track stigma has been to dislodge. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Schwartz said in an interview, she would not change a word of the 
article or where she chose to publish it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the Harvard Business Review because I wanted to reach corporate 
leaders. This was not an article for women," she said. "I did not write the 
article for Good Housekeeping, Ms. or Working Woman." 
</P>
<P>
But the article provoked such concern from women that Harvard Business Review 
sold 11,000 reprints. Schwartz was besieged with press requests from women's 
magazines and foreign journalists from Venezuela to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
She did 75 interviews in two months, often encountering what she called the 
same misinterpretations of her arguments. Many times, she spent much of the 
time denying and disavowing the mommy track idea. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said her patience finally expired during a broadcast with a West Coast 
radio station when she exploded at her interviewer because the woman admitted 
that she hadn't read the article. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a catharsis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the controversy has further enhanced her influence, which has 
grown steadily since she founded Catalyst in 1962 as a research and consulting 
service to help women re-enter the work force after raising families, something 
she did herself after taking an eight-year break to raise three children. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, speaking invitations have multiplied from colleges, 
institutes and business conferences, Schwartz said. She said women ranging from 
MBA candidates to CIA employees have approached her with positive comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely euphoric. It's opened discussion to issues that had been 
submerged," she said. "What I want to do is encourage honesty and openness." 
</P>
<P>
Many influential professional women have expressed admiration for Schwartz's 
ability to reach into male-dominated corporate bastions so boldly, though they 
have mixed feelings about what she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what she did was very good because it brought the issue to the table," 
said Deborah Biondolillo, vice president of human resources for the computer 
company Apple U.S.A. "I didn't happen to agree with her solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz has failed to appease her most vociferous critics, prominent feminists 
who think that her approach is misguided, elitist, arrogant and destructive. 
</P>
<P>
Many still believe that she has perpetuated the mommy track idea despite her 
denials. 
</P>
<P>
"Her article was a very dangerous retrogression and acquiescence to sex 
discrimination," said Betty Friedan, a co-founder of the National Organization 
for Women and author of "The Feminine Mystique," considered one of the most 
important books about the women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not changed one iota in my mind my outrage at Felice Schwartz," Friedan 
said. "She is simply not a feminist, not committed to equality. She has an 
employer mentality." 
</P>
<P>
Even some less-militant proponents of women's rights are concerned that 
Schwartz has hurt their efforts to obtain professional parity with men. Some 
say she has further isolated herself by suggesting that women disclose at job 
interviews whether they plan to have children. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are still getting fired from their jobs when they're pregnant. I don't 
know why she thinks we have that kind of protection," said Judsen Culbreth, 
editor of Working Mother magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting this burden on women is just such backward thinking, just such 1950s, 
man-in-the-pinstripe-suit-type thinking," Culbreth said. "I don't think she's 
meant to do this, but it particularly does damage to working mothers, who are 
going to have this question mark raised now in the minds of so many 
corporations." 
</P>
<P>
Both Schwartz and her critics have said the discussion is helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Schwartz said, "I am sure there are still lots of women who think I'm 
their enemy. That's painful after 27 years."

MARKET IGNORES TOKYO DECLINE; DOW RISES 14.41

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. shares rebounded Monday in an impressive afternoon rally, shrugging off a 
steep decline in the Tokyo stock market to extend their recent advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials finished 14.41 points higher at 2,755.63, 
after hovering in negative territory most of the day. The blue chip barometer 
had been down as much as 28 points earlier in the trading session. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues edged out declining ones in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 730 up, 700 down and 533 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Wall Street was buoyed by positive market sentiment and continued 
strength in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan on Monday, anxiety about a possible interest rate hike and the yen's 
decline against the dollar sent the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange 
plummeting to a 14-month low. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some stocks in New York were helped Monday by news that UAL 
Corp.'s unions and biggest shareholder have mounted a joint effort to install 
new directors in a shareholder proxy fight and buy the airline company for 
around $3.8 billion, or more than $175 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, the collapse of a debt-financed offer for UAL, parent of 
United Airlines, touched off a major tumble in the stock market and raised the 
first big doubts about the future of the corporate takeover craze of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow index plunged 190 points last Oct. 13, the day the $300-a-share offer 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
UAL stock closed Monday at 154 1/2 a share, up 12 from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks closed lower after Tokyo's plunge and losses were exaggerated 
by thin volume. Traders said investors were holding back ahead of today's 
annual British budget announcement. The Financial Times index of 100 stocks 
ended 25.9 points down at 2,238.0. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Closes Mixed as Mark Dominates 
</P>
<P>
The dollar turned in a mixed performance against other major currencies Monday 
in trading dominated by the West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices posted minor gains in domestic and overseas dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $400.80 for an ounce of gold 
as of 4 p.m. EST, up 80 cents from Friday's late bid. On New York's Commodity 
Exchange, gold for March delivery settled at $400.70 an ounce, $1.10 higher 
than Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the support for conservative parties in Sunday's general 
election in East Germany sparked interest in buying West German marks. 
</P>
<P>
As trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6860 West German 
marks, down from 1.6980 marks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against the Japanese yen, however, as dealers grew impatient 
waiting for the Tokyo government to raise the country's key interest rates, 
which has been expected for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One dollar bought 153.05 yen late in New York, up from 152.65 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bonds End Session With Scant Change 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished narrowly mixed Monday as short-term issues posted small 
declines and longer-term securities advanced. 
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond added 1/16 point, or 60 cents per $1,000 
face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, fell to 8.53% from 8.54%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.1875%, the same as late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Soybeans Jump on Brazil Expectations 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices rose sharply Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid 
talk of lower-than-expected Brazilian yields and diminishing fears that 
Brazil's economic reforms will lead to a flood of soybean marketings. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, coffee, sugar and cocoa futures fell sharply; 
livestock and meat futures advanced; petroleum futures were mixed, and precious 
metals were higher. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures settled 6 to 8 1/4 cents higher, with March at $5.90 a bushel.

PEOPLE: HALLMAN TO JOIN MICROSOFT CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael R. Hallman, president of Boeing Computer Services, will become 
president and chief operating officer of the software publishing company 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Hallman, 44, will join Microsoft on April 2 and will succeed Jon A. Shirley on 
June 30, when Shirley retires. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing Co., meanwhile, announced that Arthur E. Hitsman, executive vice 
president of Boeing Aerospace &amp; Electronics, will replace Hallman, while 
John B. Sheridan will take over Hitsman's job. Sheridan is vice president and 
general manager of BA&amp;E's Electronic Systems Division. 
</P>
<P>
Hallman, who has been president of BCS since November, 1987, is responsible for 
all Boeing computing and communications systems, including the company's 
outside computer services, which had sales of $360 million in 1989. He managed 
a staff of 13,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft employs about 5,000 people and had sales of $803.5 million in fiscal 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hallman, who holds a master's degree in business from Michigan, has more than 
23 years of computer experience. Before joining Boeing, he spent 20 years at 
IBM. 
</P>
<P>
"With his background, Mike will bring new insights into how Microsoft can help 
larger organizations utilize personal computers for greater productivity and 
improved information access," said Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley will remain on Microsoft's board and will serve as a consultant to the 
company for strategic projects. 
</P>
<P>
Hitsman was named to his current post at Boeing in May, 1989, when the former 
Boeing Aerospace and Boeing Electronics divisions were consolidated. Prior to 
that, he served as president of Boeing Electronics and vice president and 
general manager of the Ballistics Systems Division of Boeing Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
Hitsman, who joined Boeing in 1950 as a design engineer, holds a master's 
degree in mechanical engineering from Oregon State.

MARKETING: TARGETING MOVIE ADS WITHOUT STICKING YOUR (LEFT) FOOT IN YOUR MOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One good way to persuade people to go see a particular movie is to tout how 
many Academy Awards it has won. With the Oscars ceremony set for Monday 
evening, filmmakers are doing everything they can -- from placing ads in the 
Hollywood trades to arranging special screenings -- to persuade Academy judges 
that their flick is No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But long before Oscar nominees become Oscar winners, filmmakers have to find 
other marketing hooks for their movies. That's why the nation's estimated 43 
million Americans with physical disabilities are being marketed to as never 
before to see one particular motion picture: "My Left Foot." The film -- 
nominated for five Oscars -- dramatizes the story of the late Irish writer and 
painter Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the film doesn't win the Academy Award for best picture -- and some 
critics think that it should -- perhaps it at least deserves recognition for 
its innovative marketing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
An ongoing marketing campaign for "My Left Foot" featuring direct mail, 
follow-up phone calls and even lobbying in Washington will likely be put into 
high gear after the Academy Awards. The unusual campaign not only speaks 
directly to people with disabilities but was also crafted with the help of 
carefully sought advice from the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will be a model not only for distributors of motion pictures, but 
for all advertisers," said Paul K. Longmore, a Los Angeles historian and 
author, who is disabled. He was asked by Miramax Films to write a special 
review of the film from the perspective of a person with disabilities. His 
review -- for which he was not paid -- was mailed directly to more than 5,000 
key organizations, publications and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"Miramax has their agenda. They want people to pay to see the movie," said 
Longmore. "But I want people to buy tickets for a different reason. I'm trying 
to promote civil rights for the disabled. People with disabilities should see 
Christy Brown as a role model." 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing for McDonald's or Levis to show disabled people in commercials. 
But it is something else to target the disabled just as some advertisers target 
blacks or Latinos. "Disabled people do have money," said Norma Vescovo, 
executive director of the Independent Living Center of Southern California. 
"It's nice to see someone finally recognize that." 
</P>
<P>
But Miramax isn't selling wheelchairs or special equipment. It is selling a 
movie that many people with disabilities say realistically portrays a disabled 
person. And this is done with an actor -- Daniel Day Lewis -- who is not 
disabled. That can make it an even tougher sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Every film has at least one special interest group, and we recognize the 
disabled community is a key element here," said Russell Schwartz, executive 
vice president of marketing at Miramax. "Our job is to get as many people as 
possible to see the film." 
</P>
<P>
But until the marketing campaign begins its big push in a few weeks, Miramax is 
trying to keep a relatively low profile about it. It is believed, however, that 
the campaign could include a major advertising effort in publications for the 
disabled and increased availability of specially made versions of the film for 
the blind and hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"Many marketers are concerned they'll be viewed as exploitative if they target 
the disabled," said Stan L. Friedman, who owns Santa Monica-based Friedman 
Communications and helped plan the campaign. "But the disabled community wants 
to be talked to. They want to be acknowledged as existing. People with 
disabilities do make money and they do go to movies." 
</P>
<P>
The question is: Can a relatively low-budget but carefully targeted marketing 
campaign persuade disabled people that this is the movie to see? 
</P>
<P>
Miramax hopes so. Besides mailing the specially written film reviews to 
organizations for the disabled, Miramax enclosed a one-page form that asked for 
opinions not only about the movie but also about the marketing behind it. These 
mailings were followed up by phone calls to each group or publication. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ideal world, it would be better if we weren't a group that had to be 
marketed to," said Tom Ritter, who is disabled and who produces TV 
documentaries on the disabled. "But we're not in an ideal world. We need to be 
viewed as a special interest group," said the brother of actor John Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
Miramax also hired Tari Susan Hartman, regarded as a leading expert in 
marketing to people with disabilities. Hartman, who owns Los Angeles-based Ein 
Sof Communications, was formerly executive director of Media Access Office, a 
group that works to ensure accurate portrayals of people with disabilities in 
films and on television. 
</P>
<P>
"The disabled don't want this done for them, they want it done with them," said 
Hartman, who recently returned from Washington, where she lobbied in support of 
the Americans with disabilities bill that seeks to end discrimination against 
people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're creating a bridge between the corporate world and the disability world," 
said Hartman. "It turns out, both sides may be saying the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Locklear Pops Out in New Magazine Ad 
</P>
<P>
The new-look Heather Locklear began popping up all over this week. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
A complex, pop-up print ad featuring Locklear for Bally's Health &amp; Tennis 
Corp. of America appears in the March 19 issue of People magazine. The pop-up 
portion of the ad is preceded by a full-page ad that poses this question: What 
can you do in 30 minutes that makes you feel good all over? 
</P>
<P>
When readers turn the page, the answer pops out in the form of Locklear. 
Actually, there are 11 separate pop-ups of Locklear exercising on high-tech 
equipment at the club, which operates under the name Holiday Spa Health Club in 
Southern California. The print campaign was created by the ad agency J. Walter 
Thompson/Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Will the ad grab as much attention as one the company formerly ran that asked 
readers to rub a coin across a photo of Cher's belly button to find out about a 
new promotion? Don't bet on it. Locklear's belly button is completely concealed 
in this ad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riney Talking to E&amp;J Gallo -- Again 
</P>
<P>
Will Hal Riney &amp; Associates soon be making ads for E&amp;J Gallo again? 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1987 Riney made big news when he resigned the $70-million Gallo 
wine business in a huff. At the time, Riney refused to say why he quit the 
notoriously difficult client. But now, Riney's agency, which created ads for 
Bartles &amp; Jaymes wine cooler as well as Gallo wine, is once again talking 
with Ernest Gallo about the business. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we resigned the business doesn't mean I hate Gallo," said Riney. 
"Ernest and I have remained friends since our separation. If we can be of some 
help to them, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Competition Aimed at Ad Students 
</P>
<P>
Advertising contests often reward those who need attention least: the 
successful. But students and advertising newcomers are finally getting some 
well-deserved attention. 
</P>
<P>
A new ad competition, sponsored by the Los Angeles Creative Club, will reward 
college students. The 10-year-old group of ad professionals is seeking 
student-created entries that have not been published or broadcast. There will 
be no cash prizes, but winners will receive certificates of merit. Complete 
rules are available from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Although judges have not been selected, they will be chosen from among the top 
creative directors in Los Angeles. And with creative eyes like that judging the 
contest, said Dick Merritt, vice president of the Creative Club, "Some winners 
could be offered jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all of this year's Belding Awards entries have been turned over to 
Bruce Schroffel, president of the ad agency Schroffel &amp; Associates. And 
he's making the award-winning commercials, print ads and collateral available 
to schools that might want them. For years, the entries have been tossed out 
after the contest. "But I complained so much about that policy," said 
Schroffel, "they decided to give them to me."

DEBATE OVER SAFETY OF MSG HEATS UP AGAIN; 
</P>

How can a government regulate a health problem if it's not sure it even exists? 
Never mind. A group of activists wants it done anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the controversy over the widely used flavor enhancer MSG has 
dramatically resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
MSG "sufferers" have formed a lobby group -- the National Organization 
Mobilized to Stop Glutamate (NOMSG) -- which is speaking out regularly about 
what it considers the additive's dangers. 
</P>
<P>
A group of prominent neuroscientists has urged the Food and Drug Administration 
to look more closely at new reports that MSG might be a neurotoxin -- a 
substance that can destroy nerve tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, top FDA officials have pledged to reassess the rules governing the 
labeling of products containing the food additive. 
</P>
<P>
The last word on MSG was supposed to be the findings 10 years ago by George 
Washington University scientist Robert Kenney. In an attempt to verify the 
so-called "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome," Kenney fed 35 people a soft drink 
laced with the food additive MSG. 
</P>
<P>
The results were dramatic. Following the precise pattern of symptoms commonly 
attributed to the flavor enhancer, the group reported headaches, nausea, 
stomach distress, salivation and weakness. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was that when Kenney checked his control group of 35, who were 
given an MSG-free version of the same drink, they reported the same symptoms 
with the same frequency. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney tried again a year later, comparing an MSG solution with ordinary fruit 
juice. But this time the allegations of allergic and toxic reactions that have 
been levied against MSG for the better part of 20 years received an even bigger 
setback. Orange and tomato juice, he found, caused the symptoms commonly 
associated with MSG more often than MSG did. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are happy to report anecdotes, but when I tested people, I 
just didn't find the same reactions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his work and similar findings of a number of other scientists over the 
past decade, today the list of symptoms allegedly caused by MSG has grown to 
include asthma, diarrhea, muscle swelling and heart irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
The reemergence of the MSG controversy has come even though there is no 
definitive scientific evidence confirming any of the charges that MSG is 
harmful. Indeed, for many scientists and policy-makers, the MSG issue has come 
to pose something of a dilemma. Is it possible, some ask, that the many 
Americans who believe themselves to be sensitive to MSG are either allergic to 
something else or are imagining things? 
</P>
<P>
MSG is a version of glutamic acid, one of the 20 amino acids naturally present 
in nearly all protein. Once derived from seaweed and now produced through the 
fermentation of molasses, glutamate has been used in Oriental cooking as a 
flavor enhancer for nearly 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since the turn of the century, the amount of MSG has steadily grown to the 
point where the average American now consumes about half a gram of MSG per day 
in everything from canned soup to fast food. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 20 years ago, however, that doubts were raised about the safety 
of MSG. In a short letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, a doctor 
described a variety of symptoms -- including general weakness, throbbing 
sensations and numbness that spread from his neck to both arms -- that he 
commonly experienced while eating Chinese food flavored with MSG. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the controversy was the publication in the early 1970s of studies 
showing that young rodents force-fed high doses of MSG were developing brain 
lesions, a finding that suggested food products containing MSG might be harmful 
to children. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the ranks of those claiming sensitivity to MSG has steadily grown. 
In the NOMSG organization, for example, there is a San Diego woman who says she 
had swelling in her joints, a 20-year-old Kansas City woman whose doctors 
thought she had multiple sclerosis, another woman with skin rashes, a man with 
migraines, and dozens more with ailments they all trace to food laced with MSG. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's response to the latest tide of complaints has been a promise to 
reevaluate the labeling rules on the chemical, which permit MSG made by certain 
manufacturing techniques to be labeled as "natural flavors" or "seasonings" 
instead of by its chemical name. But beyond that, agency officials say there 
simply isn't enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions from any of the 
apparently MSG-related phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the research suggesting a link between MSG and brain damage 
in rats. The concern is based on the fact that glutamate, which is found 
naturally in large quantities in the brain, acts as a neurotransmitter, 
stimulating brain cells. However, when released in excess quantities -- as can 
happen in a stroke, for example -- it becomes a neurotoxin, stimulating brain 
cells so much they die. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether glutamate in food can have the same effect. In research 
beginning 20 years ago, Washington University neurophysiologist John Olney 
suggested that in infants -- whose brains are more vulnerable than those of 
adults -- it could. In tests on infants in seven species -- ranging from 
monkeys to rats -- Olney found MSG-related brain damage resulting in obesity, 
growth retardation and reproductive dysfunction. Since the amounts of MSG Olney 
administered to the animals were roughly comparable to those a small child 
might get from a bowl of canned soup, Olney warns that children are at risk 
from MSG. 
</P>
<P>
"There are infants around the world who are being exposed to MSG and 
potentially damaged by it," said Olney. "I'm not saying it should be banned, 
but the levels in foods have got to be regulated." 
</P>
<P>
Olney's research is taken seriously enough that at a meeting last October, the 
Social Issues Committee of the Society for Neuroscience agreed to ask the FDA 
to look more closely at how MSG and other amino acids might cause brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a sense among some of the scientists that the FDA is considering 
data that comes from companies with a vested interest in MSG over data 
generated in research labs that say it is problematic," said Columbia 
University researcher Nancy Wexler, who also heads the Hereditary Disease 
Foundation. "If there is a potential problem, especially with an additive that 
doesn't serve any real purpose, we want it taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
But few of Olney's colleagues believe there is enough evidence against MSG to 
warrant immediate action. There are also a number of questions about his 
research. For example, glutamate breaks down very quickly once it enters the 
body. The only way for Olney to get glutamate levels high enough in the 
bloodstream of animals to cause brain damage was to force-feed them the 
chemical in high quantities over a very short period of time. In other studies 
that allowed allowed the animals to eat MSG at their own pace, the animals 
never showed any adverse effects. 
</P>
<P>
Olney defends his method as the best approximation of the way humans eat MSG 
in, for example, a bowl of soup -- in large and concentrated doses. 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. "It's seriously flawed research," said Stanley Gershoff, dean 
of the Tufts University School of Nutrition. "It just happens that is just not 
the way humans consume glutamate." By using a stomach tube, Gershoff says, 
Olney also bypassed the gastrointestinal tract, which contains enzymes that 
help to break down glutamate before it reaches high levels in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
Even if true, however, Olney's theory accounts only for MSG toxicity in 
children. The chemical's effects on the brain do not show up in experiments on 
adult animals and, what's more, adult brains are protected by a "blood-brain 
barrier" that is not fully present in childhood. Why some adults should also 
report a wide range of allegedly MSG-related symptoms is another, even more 
baffling, question. 
</P>
<P>
Take the most commonly reported and mildest of MSG symptoms -- the feelings of 
tightness in the chest, neck and upper back areas. These are areas where the 
body "refers" pain from the throat, leading some to speculate that MSG simply 
irritates the esophagus. This would also explain why other substances -- like 
orange juice and, in some studies, black coffee -- appear to have the same 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the more serious symptoms attributed to MSG? Experts say the 
question is wide open. One theory arises from allergy testing done by a Reston, 
Va., firm, Health Studies Collegium, which has measured the responses of more 
than 8,000 people to some 235 food additives and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
According to the firm's president, Russell Jaffe, 3.8% of the general 
population were positive when tested for MSG sensitivity. However, of those 
afflicted with a variety of medical conditions -- asthma, inflammatory bowel 
disease, rheumatoid arthritis -- close to 50% registered positive for MSG, 
leading him to believe that certain types of bodily tissue damaged by disease 
could be sensitive to even small levels of glutamate in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
Clouding the picture still more is the fact that many symptoms attributed to 
MSG might be caused by something else. In a recent survey of 3,222 people, for 
example, 43% of respondents reported at least one of a number of unpleasant 
symptoms -- from diarrhea to heartburn to abdominal cramps -- in association 
with consumption of food, with or without MSG.

TINA BROWN AND A PARTY OF RENOWN; 
</P>
<P>
BENEFIT: AFTER MRS. REAGAN JUST SAID NO TO PHOENIX HOUSE, VANITY FAIR'S EDITOR 
SAID YES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's the do-good decade, proclaims Vanity Fair magazine. And few are better 
placed to do it than Vanity Fair Editor in Chief Tina Brown. After six years at 
the helm, she is New York's priestess of glossy publishing, the turnaround 
artist who molded a tottering, year-old magazine into an upscale, high-profile 
monthly. (Circulation was 220,000 when she took over; it was 760,000 at last 
count, and advertising has tripled, too.) 
</P>
<P>
Like her magazine, which offers in-depth stories on pop stars and global 
politics in the same issue, Brown has a glittery, fun-loving facade buttressed 
by intellect. 
</P>
<P>
Also like her magazine, which features coverage of night life on the back pages 
every month, Brown enjoys nothing more than a good party. Make that a 
"brilliant" party. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the British-born editor, 36, flew to Los Angeles recently with what 
she calls her "inner circle" of "brilliant party minds" to plan Thursday's gala 
at Culver Studios, advertised as the "first great Hollywood benefit" of the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fund-raiser for Phoenix House, the New York-based, nonprofit drug 
rehabilitation program that has four facilities in California and was about to 
build a fifth, in Lake View Terrace, until Nancy Reagan withdrew her support 
last September. 
</P>
<P>
She pulled out after residents near the proposed San Fernando Valley site said 
they did not want a rehab center in their neighborhood and threatened to picket 
her Bel-Air home. 
</P>
<P>
The party invitations read "Just Say Yes," and about 500 people have said it, 
at $250 per ticket. Understandably, Mrs. Reagan is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan's withdrawal in midstream left Phoenix House founder Dr. Mitch 
Rosenthal with $2.8 million worth of donations already collected, much of it 
from Reagan friends, and another $2.4 million pledged but never received. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal, who flew to Los Angeles with Brown, says some donors asked for their 
money back when Mrs. Reagan withdrew her support. He told them it would be 
"legally incorrect," and they did not pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
He also says he might have proceeded at the site even without Mrs. Reagan's 
support if all the pledged donations had come through. Despite residents' 
protests, he explains, the Los Angeles City Council was favorable to the 
project, and he believes neighbors eventually would have come around, as they 
have at other Phoenix House locations. 
</P>
<P>
But back to the party, which may raise enough money for Rosenthal to buy and 
build on a new L.A. site. 
</P>
<P>
Brown promises it will be "riveting," with "extraordinary visuals" and a 
"wonderful mix of people." 
</P>
<P>
"It will not be suit meets suit and talks about deal," she explains, perched at 
sofa's edge in the Four Seasons hotel lobby. "Suit is going to meet exciting, 
new wonderful person. Suit is going to meet other suits, but he'll also meet 
creative people, fun people, pretty people. It will be an electric mixture of 
people," she says breathlessly in her soft, British accent. Parties obviously 
excite her. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one of the two books she wrote while in her 20s is titled "Life as a 
Party." It is a collection of profiles first printed in The Tatler, England's 
oldest magazine, where she was editor from 1979 to 1983, and where she 
increased circulation by 300% during her tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, she was named England's Young Journalist of the Year (1978) for 
her columns in Punch Magazine. Her contributions to the New Statesman magazine 
earned her the Most Promising Female Journalist award in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
For Thursday's festivities, Brown has persuaded Broadway producer David Brown 
to close the Booth Theatre in Manhattan for one night so "Tru" star Robert 
Morse can fly to Los Angeles and perform an excerpt from the play about Truman 
Capote at the benefit. Kid Creole and The Coconuts will provide musical 
entertainment. Gianni Versace has donated $50,000 to help underwrite party 
costs; the Gap also has contributed money. A donor who wishes to remain 
anonymous pledged $200,000 for Phoenix House even before the party, and more 
contributions are predicted after what Brown expects will be an "extraordinary" 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
It will be her first time ever to direct a benefit, she says with a laugh, 
calling herself a "sort of virgin chairwoman." But she has given many parties 
for the magazine, she says, recalling last year's fifth anniversary bash: "It 
was a very stellar night. The late Steve Rubell of Studio 54 and his partner 
Ian Schrager lent us the basement of the Century Paramount Hotel (in 
Manhattan), which was the former Diamond Jim's Horseshoe. We turned it into an 
incredible '30s supper club . . . with gold palm trees, an all-girl saxophone 
band. It was wonderful . . . not just for the visuals, which were very 
exciting, but also because of the mix of people. You had a Henry Kissinger side 
by side with a rock star with a rich person. There were hip young people 
gyrating next to heavy money. . . ." Her voice trails off, and her ice-blue 
eyes melt just a little. 
</P>
<P>
Brown first heard about Phoenix House, which treats adolescents and adults, 
from a friend whose drug-addicted stepson was "completely redeemed" there. She 
decided to run a profile of "Dr. Mitch" in Vanity Fair, she recalls, and asked 
writer Leslie Bennetts to do it. While researching the story, Bennetts learned 
Mrs. Reagan had abandoned the project and the tale became more titillating and 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
After the story was published, Brown visited Phoenix House in Manhattan and was 
so moved by what she saw there that she decided to give this benefit to try and 
"get the money back that had been lost" by Mrs. Reagan's pull-out. 
</P>
<P>
Brown says "the driving forces" behind the party are Vanity Fair's writers and 
contributing editors, whom she labels "stars in their own right." Most will 
attend, including Dominick Dunne whose new novel, "An Inconvenient Woman," 
features film industry folk who will be at the benefit and "who will recognize 
themselves" in Dunne's book. Brown laughs delightedly, as if every little piece 
of her party puzzle was falling in its proper place.

WORKERS READY TO TACKLE TASK OF COUNTING HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian, Doris, Gwen and J. C. go to work for the federal government today, 
taking part in the nation's most ambitious effort to count people like 
themselves: the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at dusk today and working through dawn Wednesday, U.S. Census Bureau 
officials and homeless people hired especially for the effort will canvas the 
nation's skid rows and remote corners, seeking to count that legion of citizens 
who spend their nights in shelters and subway tunnels, flophouses and movie 
theaters, beaches, canyons and cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless count also marks the start of the 1990 national census for most of 
the country. Americans will begin receiving census forms in the mail late this 
week. The process of counting an estimated 250 million people will last through 
the summer as the Census Bureau attempts to visit every household that does not 
return a census form. 
</P>
<P>
For the enumeration of the homeless, the Census Bureau has been recruiting an 
army of street people, offering them $7.50 an hour and the hope of longer 
employment if they do a good job. 
</P>
<P>
If the Census Bureau meets its hiring goal, there will be 15,000 people -- 
3,000 of them in California -- knocking on shelter doors, peering down alleys, 
looking under bridges and waiting outside abandoned buildings for occupants to 
emerge at dawn Wednesday. The census takers will interview people who are in a 
mood to answer questions about themselves and merely note the presence of those 
who don't want to talk or who are asleep. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, about 300 "enumerators" will fan out across the county to 
tally the homeless. Outfitted in white vests that say "Census Taker" on the 
back, they will check scores of shelters as well as all the usual gathering 
spots, poking their flashlights under freeway overpasses, trolling along 
railroad tracks and hiking into the rural outback where migrant fieldworkers 
sometimes camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to put everything we can into making the count as accurate as 
possible," said Susan Oakson, coordinator for the Orange County Homeless Issues 
Task Force, which is helping the U.S. Census Bureau in the effort. "But it's 
clear there will be thousands of people missed. The homeless are the targets of 
harassment and violent crimes, so they try to be as invisible as possible. That 
will affect the results." 
</P>
<P>
While fewer than a dozen homeless people have been tapped to help with the 
count in Orange County, census officials in Los Angeles have been more 
successful in finding people down on their luck to help with the tally. Census 
Bureau officials decided to hire the homeless in an effort to build an 
effective bridge to the population they will attempt to count. 
</P>
<P>
Brian, Doris, Gwen and J. C. -- they didn't want to reveal their last names -- 
will be among about 300 census takers in Los Angeles working their way through 
Skid Row, the neighborhood that has been their home. The four are, by turns, 
optimistic and apprehensive about the prospect of interviewing their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to talk to us because we are already down there and they know 
us," said Gwen, a slim, middle-aged woman who said she lives on county relief 
payments and currently resides in a welfare hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Gwen and the others will be taking part in the post-midnight phase of the 
homeless census. Between 6 and 10 p.m., other census takers will be visiting 
shelters and hotels. After midnight, teams of enumerators will seek out people 
who live outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
As for the potential for danger, Gwen said: "I don't know how it could be more 
dangerous than day-to-day living." 
</P>
<P>
But there are places where the three women in the group -- Gwen, Doris and J. 
C. -- said they would not go to count people. 
</P>
<P>
"Crocker is a major dope street. So you don't want to be there," Gwen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't go on Crocker and I won't go to MacArthur Park," said Doris. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts agree that there probably never has been anything approaching a 
definitive count of homeless people in America. Estimates have ranged from a 
few hundred thousand to 3 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has an estimated 10,000 homeless, Oakson said. In Los Angeles, 
Bob Vilmur, the city's homeless projects coordinator, estimates that there are 
35,000 people living in shelters, cheap hotels, other temporary quarters or on 
the street. The most recent study of the city's Skid Row population, completed 
in 1987 by the Community Redevelopment Agency, reported that barely 1,000 
people slept on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are disagreements over the definition of homeless -- whether it 
should include people who are living temporarily with friends or relatives, or 
whether it should be limited to people who abide in shelters or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Orange County's homeless, for example, are believed to camp in their 
cars or spend periods in inexpensive motels, Oakson said. When the money runs 
out, they return to a life without a roof over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"They might spend two days with a family friend, two days on the street, then 
two days in a car," Oakson said. "It cyclical." 
</P>
<P>
In its tally of the homeless, the Census Bureau will not include people in 
jails or halfway houses or those who are doubled up with friends and family. 
Such people will be counted but as part of the general populace. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're going to get is a head count of street people and of people in 
shelters," said Peter Bounpane, assistant director of the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"The count will be as good as the assistance we get," Bounpane said. 
</P>
<P>
Doubts about the accuracy of the homeless census have led some homeless 
advocates, most notably Mitch Snyder of the Washington-based Community for 
Creative Non-Violence, to urge homeless people to boycott the census. Snyder 
argues that an undercount of homeless people will serve the needs of 
politicians who oppose spending more money on housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Snyder's organization have burned census forms, and Snyder has said 
his group plans to block census takers from entering some shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County homeless advocates have generally cooperated in the survey but 
understand the limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a concern that these numbers will be used as the ultimate figure for the 
homeless," Oakson said. "These numbers need to be balanced with a lot of other 
factors." 
</P>
<P>
At a census training session Monday in Los Angeles, where Gwen and her friends 
received their marching orders, most of the 12 trainees said they did not think 
the census would yield a complete count of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt they will find everyone," Brian said. "There are more homeless people 
than anyone ever imagined." 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I'd say if some stranger came up to me and started to ask me a 
bunch of questions," Gwen said. "I'd tell 'em to go to hell." 
</P>
<P>
Yet they vowed to do their best. 
</P>
<P>
"How else are we going to get enough money for housing if we don't know how 
many people there are that need it?" asked Doris. "If the count is not right, 
we're going to lose on all levels -- jobs, medical, everything."

'FREEWAY KILLER' APPEAL REJECTED BY U.S. JUSTICES; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: WILLIAM BONIN, CLAIMING LAWYER HAD A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, IS 
DENIED A NEW TRIAL. FIFTEEN OTHER CALIFORNIA DEATH ROW APPEALS ARE ALSO TURNED 
DOWN.

<P>
The Supreme Court turned down an appeal Monday from "Freeway Killer" William G. 
Bonin, who was sentenced to death for murdering 14 teen-age boys in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
On a 7-2 vote, the justices rejected Bonin's contention that he was denied a 
fair trial because his lawyer had a conflict of interest. (Bonin vs. 
California, 88-7381.) 
</P>
<P>
Bonin's was one of 16 Death Row appeals from California that the justices 
rejected Monday, but the only one that prompted a written dissent. 
</P>
<P>
The other appeals challenged jury instructions used in California death penalty 
cases. Two weeks ago, in a similar case involving Richard Boyde, the killer of 
a convenience store clerk in Riverside County, the justices on a 5-4 vote 
upheld the constitutionality of the instructions. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, they dismissed all appeals raising the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
The high court actions do not mean that Bonin or any of the other Death Row 
inmates face imminent execution, state attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be two or three years at least" before Bonin faces death, 
said California Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane Gillette, who coordinates death penalty 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Bonin can file new appeals on different grounds in federal court 
in Los Angeles. Even if those actions are quickly rejected, the case moves on 
to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

"The 9th Circuit is notoriously slow," Gillette said, often taking more than 
two years to rule on an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Bonin, a truck driver from Downey, prowled the Los Angeles and Orange County 
areas in a van, picking up teen-age boys. He was convicted of strangling them 
and dumping their bodies, usually nude, along the freeways in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Bonin's victims were Orange County youths, whose bodies were discovered 
between December, 1979, and May, 1980. Although Bonin had already received a 
death sentence from a Los Angeles jury by the time he came to trial in Orange 
County, prosecutors tried him for the four Orange County murders as well, 
saying they wanted an assurance that Bonin would be punished even if his Los 
Angeles convictions were overturned. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1983, an Orange County Superior Court jury recommended that Bonin be 
sent to the gas chamber for the four murders committed in the county. 
</P>
<P>
As his trial was about to begin in Los Angeles in 1981, Bonin demanded to 
change lawyers. Prosecutors objected, contending that Bonin was simply seeking 
a delay. They also said Bonin's choice, William H. Charvet, had a potential 
conflict of interest because he had consulted with an accomplice of Bonin who 
was set to testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
When Superior Court Judge William J. Keene asked Bonin to explain why he needed 
a different lawyer, the defendant replied: "Personal vibes." 
</P>
<P>
Though troubled by the request, the judge granted Bonin's wish to retain 
Charvet. A jury found Bonin guilty of 10 Los Angeles County murders and he was 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a new set of lawyers has contended that Bonin's right "to the 
effective assistance of counsel" was violated because Charvet had a conflict of 
interest. They said the lawyer's work was tainted because he had met with the 
accomplice and because he had discussed a book deal with Bonin. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the state Supreme Court rejected this appeal on a 6-1 vote. Justice 
Stanley Mosk said the judge erred by granting Bonin's request without forcing 
him to waive his right to appeal the issue. However, Mosk also concluded that 
the error was harmless, because Charvet had conducted a vigorous defense for 
Bonin, who was later convicted of four murders in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. issued 
an eight-page dissent Monday, saying Bonin deserved a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Bonin stands to be executed, it is imperative that this court ensure 
that he was fairly tried and sentenced," they said. "The Sixth Amendment 
demands that every criminal defendant receive the assistance of a conflict-free 
counsel." 
</P>
<P>
Other Death Row appeals dismissed Monday included those of: 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. McDowell Jr., who killed a maid and stabbed a neighbor in a 
Hollywood Hills robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Lucky, who shot and killed the co-owners of a Los Angeles jewelry store 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Eric B. Kimble, who broke into a home in the Doheny Estates area of Los Angeles 
and murdered the couple who lived there. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Bloom Jr., who shot and killed his parents and stabbed his stepsister 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Moore, who fatally stabbed a Long Beach couple who managed the 
apartment complex where Moore once lived. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Robbins, who kidnaped and murdered a 6-year-old San Bernardino County 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Silva, who committed a mutilation murder in San Bernardino County.

FLOODED RIVERS SWAMP SOUTHERN CITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Military police officers guarded against looters in flood-ravaged southern 
Alabama, where the town of Elba remained a muddy hole Monday, two days after an 
earthen levee ruptured along the Pea River. 
</P>
<P>
Storm-choked rivers surged further beyond their banks in southern Alabama, 
Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, driving families from their homes to join 
thousands who have fled from flooding that has led to at least 13 deaths 
throughout the South. 
</P>
<P>
Runoff from as much as 18 inches of rain last week was expected to drive the 
Alabama River more than 20 feet above flood stage in the state capital of 
Montgomery, authorities said. Downstream in Selma, the river was already 18 
feet beyond its banks and was expected to rise another 2 feet before cresting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The latest evacuations around the two cities Monday left as many as 800 people 
out of their homes in the immediate area, authorities said. The total number of 
evacuations in Alabama alone since last weekend exceeded 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters that ravaged northern Georgia moved south Monday, forcing more 
evacuations and traffic problems as rain-swollen rivers and streams left their 
banks. The Chattahoochee River, which crested Saturday at its highest level in 
44 years in the Atlanta area, was at 41 feet Monday, well past its flood stage 
of 34 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities evacuated low-lying areas along the river near Columbus, Ga., 
including a trailer park, and the river level was expected to rise steadily 
between Columbus and the Florida line, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ocmulgee River, with a flood stage of 18 feet, reached 29.5 feet Monday 
morning and was nearing a crest of about 30 feet, said Russell Post, a National 
Weather Service hydrologist. 
</P>
<P>
The Flint River at Montezuma, Ga., was on its way to an expected crest of 26 
feet today, which would be its highest since at least 1971, Post said. Some 
residents were being evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida's Panhandle, an estimated 1,000 people were evacuated. About 80% of 
families in the town of Caryville, on the banks of the Choctawhatchee River, 
were out of their homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pea River crested in Elba on Sunday morning. Water was still up to the 
roofs of some buildings, and it will be several days before most of the town's 
3,000 evacuees will be able to return, authorities estimated. 
</P>
<P>
An aerial survey by the Red Cross showed more than 600 homes in Elba swamped by 
6 feet or more of water. Mayor Fred Moore said all but one of the town's 
businesses were flooded. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt toured the flooded areas by helicopter Monday and asked 
President Bush to declare Coffee County in the far southeast corner of the 
state a federal disaster area. Coffee County was hardest hit by the flooding, 
and Hunt said he would be adding other counties to the list as damage 
assessments came in.

Pupils at Linda Vista Elementary School in Orange became environmental 
activists on Monday when their school participated in the filming of a public 
service announcement about pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The theme song for the event was a little ditty called "Take Me Out to the 
Landfill," written by Jan Richards, the coordinator of the filming. 
</P>
<P>
To the tune of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," the 21 children belted out, 
"Take me out to the landfill, take me out to the dump. Disposable diapers on 
parade, 500 years till they biodegrade. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters, chosen from the third through sixth grades, wore hard hats and 
sat on the city's colorful recycling bins for the filming. School Principal 
Thomas Cooper said this was the first time that they had an opportunity to 
participate in something like this and added that the children had memorized 
and choreographed the entire event. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, of KTTV in Los Angeles, said that Linda Vista was one of a number of 
schools in Southern California chosen for the series of public service 
announcements, which will air on Channel 11 in the beginning of April, to 
coincide with Earth Day. LAURA MICHAELIS

3 TEEN-AGERS HELD IN SHOTGUN DEATH

<P>
Three teen-agers have been arrested in connection with the single shotgun blast 
that killed a 31-year-old man early Monday after he mistakenly accused the 
three of shoplifting from an all-night convenience store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
David Eugene Davenport of Garden Grove died instantly in the 12:10 a.m. 
shooting in the parking lot outside a Circle K store at Brookhurst Street and 
Katella Avenue, Sgt. Phil Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Davenport, who was visiting a store clerk on duty, followed 
the youths outside because he suspected that they hadn't paid for their 
merchandise. A verbal and physical fight ensued, and one of the youths, a 
17-year-old boy, allegedly pulled a .20-gauge shotgun out of a car and fired it 
into Davenport's face, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
At about 12:30 a.m., Orange County sheriff's deputies arrested a 16-year-old 
girl and the 17-year-old on the Garden Grove Freeway near The City Drive, in a 
car matching one described by witnesses, Police Sgt. Douglas Morrill said. 
Their names were withheld because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
The third suspect, Cesar M. Sustait, 19, was arrested later at his Santa Ana 
home, and was held at the Garden Grove jail. The two other suspects were in 
Juvenile Hall on Monday. No shoplifting charges were filed because the group 
had paid for the merchandise, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
The Circle K clerk refused comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty shook up," said an employee contacted at the store, who declined 
to give a name. According to the employee, the suspects "paid for their stuff, 
but (Davenport) didn't think they did. So when he went out there and asked . . 
. they got (ticked) off and shot him."WENDY PAULSON

SUSPECTED SKINHEADS SOUGHT IN STABBING

<P>
Police are looking for three people, believed to be members of a white 
supremacist group, in connection with the stabbing of a local man, police said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Wayne Mudd, 21, of San Clemente, underwent emergency surgery late 
Saturday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo for a 
knife wound to his abdomen, a hospital spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd was stabbed during a confrontation between members of two alleged skinhead 
gangs in the parking lot of a San Clemente restaurant, Police Sgt. Richard 
Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we believe this is gang-related," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbing occurred at about 10:30 p.m. as Mudd and Jay Brody, 18, also of 
San Clemente, were walking to Sonny's Pizza in the 400 block of North El Camino 
Real. 
</P>
<P>
When somebody in a passing car yelled "O.C. Skins," the name of a skinhead 
group in Orange, Downing said, Brody shouted back the name of another Orange 
County-based skinhead group. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the driver of the car pulled into the parking lot of the Italian 
restaurant, where three men jumped out and began attacking the San Clemente 
residents. One of them stabbed Mudd, and the group fled before police arrived, 
Downing said. Police have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd is in fair condition while Brody suffered minor cuts and bruises, Downing 
said.FRANK MESSINA

HEARING ON BUILDING NEAR ST. JUDE SLATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will hold a public hearing at 7:30 p.m. tonight to consider 
allowing a larger medical office building next to St. Jude Hospital and 
Rehabilitation Center. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed building at the southeast corner of Harbor Boulevard and Valencia 
Mesa Drive has been rejected twice in the last seven months as being too large. 
</P>
<P>
Original plans called for a 109,000-square-foot office building to replace the 
31,500-square-foot building there now. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have complained that a larger office would increase traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, McBride Development Co. of Brea, reduced the size of the 
proposed building to 72,000 square feet and resubmitted the drawings to the 
Planning Commission in February. The commission denied those plans, 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the three-story medical building include a four-level parking garage 
with 355 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the expanded building, it is expected to adopt a 
recommendation by city planners to require off-site parking during construction 
because of the lost parking spaces. Planners also have asked the council to 
require a shuttle bus to operate between the building and parking lots at the 
hospital and a nearby closed restaurant.

</P>
<P>
If approved by the council, a $100-million complex would be built on an 85-acre 
site on the southwest corner of Santa Ana Canyon and Roosevelt roads. The 
project would be the area's first large-scale commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
The complex, which would be called Anaheim Hills Festival, would include a 
150-room hotel, 17-acre business commercial area and a 54-acre regional mall 
with shops, restaurants and a multi-screen movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
If developed, the city could gain up to $2 million in annual sales tax revenues 
from the entire project, officials said.

WHEELCHAIR TENNIS IS ON A ROLL

<TEXT>
<P>
His 9-year-old brow furrowed in concentration, Nick Boehm waved his racquet as 
the green tennis ball floated past him. 
</P>
<P>
Crouched in his wheelchair, Nick missed three more times before connecting 
solidly, buzzing the ball past his instructor's ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to feel bad that I couldn't do a sport," he said with a smile, "but now 
I can and it makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
In three Orange County cities, wheelchair-bound youths are learning to play 
tennis under a $50,000 grant from the Amateur Athletic Foundation, a sports 
organization that was endowed with surplus Los Angeles Olympics funds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first year-round wheelchair tennis program that we know of," said 
Elaine Beachey of the Los Angeles-based AAF. "This program is giving the 
opportunity to play tennis to kids who never had the chance before." 
</P>
<P>
The clinics are offered in several locations in Southern California by the 
National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis, a nonprofit San Clemente group. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, about 35 youngsters, from elementary school children to 
teen-agers, take advantage of weekly free lessons in Santa Ana, Orange and Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
But even more valuable than the opportunity to learn tennis, said instructor 
Brian Geier, is the contact between youths with similar disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great chance for them to socialize with other kids," said Geier, who 
also uses a wheelchair, "and that is very important." 
</P>
<P>
At the Dana Hills Tennis Club, Cheryl Werth watched her 10-year-old son, 
Brandon, practice his volleys under Geier's watchful eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really glad they started a weekly clinic," she said. "Brandon is improving 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
Werth grinned as Brandon stroked a solid shot into the opposite court. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure beats having him play Nintendo all the time," she said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
KEY BUILDING FITTED WITH QUAKE DEFENSE

The safest spot in town during an earthquake may be a building in the Rockwell 
Industries complex on Seal Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's Building 80, which houses a telecommunications hub of critical 
importance to Rockwell's operations, is being fitted with the latest in 
earthquake technology. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year, $17-million project involves the installation of 54 seismic shock 
absorbers, known as "seismic isolators." 
</P>
<P>
The isolators are 1,000 pound shock-dampening pads made of layered rubber and 
steel. According to Dynamic Isolation Systems Inc., which builds the isolators, 
the pads prevent the horizontal movement of the ground from being transmitted 
to the building. 
</P>
<P>
The pads function much like a suspension system in a car, serving to "isolate 
the structure from its base or foundation, greatly reducing earthquake ground 
motion to the building," according to company literature. "The effect: An 
isolated building hit by a Richter 8.0 will respond as if it were only a 5.5 
event." 
</P>
<P>
To date, 125 structures around the world and 18 in the United States have been 
fitted with isolators, which are usually placed between the foundation and the 
supporting columns of a building. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 isolated structures that have gone through earthquakes so far have come 
through with little or no damage, according to Steve Weissberg, engineer and 
Dynamic Isolation Systems marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the recent San Franciso earthquake put the Sierra Point Bridge and the 
Stanford particle accelerator lab to the test and both sustained little damage, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was $170 million worth of damage on the Stanford campus, and the 
particle accelerator came through without a scratch," Weissberg said. "The 
building did just what it was supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Wilson plans to have every piece of furniture and office 
equipment bolted down so that even if the building does move a little, work can 
resume immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to stay in business," Wilson said. "Once this work is completed, we 
expect to be able to, no matter what." MICHELLE NICOLOSI

HUNTINGTON BEACH RESCINDS HEIGHT LIMIT ON HEDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Monday night to eliminate a height limit for 
trees and hedges along property lines. 
</P>
<P>
During an emotional public hearing, several residents urged the council to 
scrap the tree-height ordinance, arguing that many trees would die if cut back 
to the six feet required by the law. 
</P>
<P>
But in rebuttal, some other residents pleaded with the city to not only keep 
the ordinance but to enforce it. They argued that tall trees along property 
lines are being misused in some cases and are hurting neighboring property 
values. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the council voted 7 to 0 to change the law so that neither trees 
nor hedges of any type are governed by the height requirement. The council said 
residents who have problems with tall trees or hedges can instead use a state 
law that allows for civil litigation in such matters. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a little-known city ordinance that jeopardized thousands of trees 
that border property lines. The ordinance limited the height of hedges to six 
feet. But the city had interpreted the law to include trees if they were used 
as hedges. 
</P>
<P>
The tree law first came before the council last November, when Glen and Jerri 
Hesprich appealed to save the tall Italian cypress trees in their back yard. 
The Hespriches said that the city staff had ordered their 20- to 30-foot 
cypresses cut down to six feet. However, a professional arborist said such a 
radical trim would kill the trees, the Hespriches said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, in November, expressed surprise at the tree-height law and 
ordered a moratorium on its enforcement. The council also asked the city staff 
to recommend a change in the law.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: THE LOCKOUT AFTERMATH; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST WORKOUT SCHEDULED FOR TODAY IN MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a month of waiting for spring training to begin, the Angels on 
Monday scrambled to pack their bags and their cars and get to Mesa, Ariz., in 
time for today's workout at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You kind of get complacent after all that time, and it looked like it was 
going to last for a while," said pitcher Jim Abbott, who spent the first day 
after the lockout running errands and gathering his gear for the drive to Mesa. 
"The settlement came so suddenly and (the first workout) came so fast. I'm 
excited to get started again. This is the time of year you start to get 
baseball fever." 
</P>
<P>
Although most Angel players spend the off-season in Southern California and 
were quickly notified, others were harder to track down. Chuck Finley had gone 
home to Louisiana, Rich Monteleone was contacted in Florida and Tony Armas was 
in Venezuela. Still, every player had been found by late Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials had less success finding hotel rooms in Mesa and players will be 
scattered at several hotels, rather than settling into one headquarters hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players' equipment was sent to Mesa at the end of last season, and 
the rest was packed and trucked to Arizona Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the players there wasn't as simple. Keeping the vagaries of airline 
travel in mind, General Manager Mike Port said he would not discipline any 
players who did not arrive in time for today's workout. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd certainly like them there before Wednesday, though," Port said. "But I 
think most of them will be there, judging from the response we got when we were 
calling our fellows when word came out (Sunday) night. Some apparently were on 
their way over, if not already on station in Mesa (Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' initial plan is to work out in Mesa through Sunday and then shift 
to Palm Springs, where they will pick up their exhibition schedule at Angels 
Stadium next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and possibly Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
They have seven open dates -- which are likely to be filled as soon as 
arrangements can be worked out -- until they face the Dodgers in the annual 
Freeway Series, probably on April 6, 7 and 8, a week later than originally 
scheduled. Two of the games will be at Dodger Stadium, the other at Anaheim 
Stadium, although the order has not yet been determined. Tickets are available 
through each team's box office. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the Angels' regular-season games went on sale Monday at Anaheim 
Stadium and at Teletron and Ticketron outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Port said the entire preseason schedule would be more certain today, once 
revisions are completed and approved by the New York offices of major league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' April 9 home opener against the Seattle Mariners will now be their 
season opener. The six games that were wiped off their schedule, three at 
Seattle and three at Oakland, could be made up in doubleheaders later in the 
season or in an extra week tacked on to the end of the current schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Port, who plans to leave for Mesa today, said he does not anticipate that the 
shortening of spring training will give players an insufficient time to prepare 
for the season and result in an inordinate number of injuries to players. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitchers were working out regularly Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 
(Anaheim) Stadium, at least until Feb. 15," he said. "I respect all the 
players' professionalism and I think I'm very safe in saying they've all been 
working out to the best of their ability in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no concerns that someone will report out of shape. . . . This is the 
first time in I don't know how long that we didn't have anyone rehabilitating 
himself from a serious injury or surgery. I think we're going to be in good 
shape figuratively and literally." 
</P>
<P>
Players said, too, that they were happy to finally be going to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife was ready to kick me out of the house a month ago," Bert Blyleven 
said. "It's been very hard. Our livelihood is baseball and we couldn't devote 
ourselves to that. I'm happy it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish said: "It was kind of an emotional roller coaster. You're 
pumped up for the beginning of the season, then all of a sudden there's no 
spring training, then you get your hopes up because you hear things that 
indicate it might end, then you get the rug pulled out from under you. . . . I 
just hope the fans haven't put baseball out of their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner can't get the lockout out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we accomplished what we wanted to accomplish," he said. "It was 
kind of frustrating. I'm just happy to be able to put on a uniform and take 
ground balls and get ready for the season. . . . It was kind of like 
arbitration. You don't want to go through it, but you're glad you did."

</P>
<P>
GUARDS TAKE OVER THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was the year of the guard in Orange County high school girls' basketball 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda point guard Aimee McDaniel set school scoring and assist records; 
Edison's Debbie Fischer set a national record for three-point shots made; and 
La Quinta's Amy Jalewalia, who plays guard -- and forward and center -- set a 
county record for most points scored in one game. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, Fischer and Jalewalia are among 10 girls named to the 1990 Times' 
All-Orange County girls' high school basketball team. Also named to the team 
were: Tammy Blackburn, a senior at Brea-Olinda; Sara Bone, a senior at El Toro; 
Jennifer Harney, a senior at Esperanza; Jennifer Rohrig, a senior at Mission 
Viejo; Melisa Sortino, a senior at Marina; Jennifer Sullivan, a senior at Ocean 
View, and Karie Yoshioka, a senior at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, who set school career records for points (1,845) and assists (602) at 
Brea-Olinda, teamed with Blackburn to form one of the best guard tandems in the 
state. They led the Lady Cats to a Southern Section title and second-place in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Both were were Times' all-county selections in their junior seasons and led 
Brea-Olinda to a Southern Section record for consecutive victories (55). 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia, who led the county and the state in scoring last season, led La 
Quinta to the Southern Section 4-A title, averaging 33 points a game. In four 
years, she scored 2,205 points, 71 shy of the county record set by Paula Tezak 
at La Habra (1980-84). Jalewalia, who will attend UCLA, set a county 
single-game scoring record (60 points). 
</P>
<P>
Fischer set county, section, state and national records with her three-point 
shooting. She set a national record for three-pointers with 105 this season. 
The old reported record was 85. She also set a reported Southern Section record 
for most three-point baskets in a game (10). She averaged 21.8 points, 4.5 
assists and had 115 career three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka, also a guard, led the the county in assists with 8.4 a game. She made 
close to 50% from three-point range, and averaged 16.5 points. She was the 
South Coast League MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Bone, a center, led El Toro in scoring (18.1 points) and rebounding (10.4). 
Harney was one of the county's most versatile big guards this season, averaging 
16.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists to lead her team to the Empire League 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrig, a two-time selection, led the county in rebounding with a 20.1 average. 
She also averaged 21.2 points. Sortino helped Marina to a second-place finish 
in the Sunset League, averaging 20.4 points and 5.1 assists. Sullivan led Ocean 
View in scoring (17.3) and rebounding (14.7). 
</P>
<P>
Those earning honorable mention were: Jenny Newsome, a senior guard for Rancho 
Alamitos; Denise Gandara, a senior forward for University High; Tracy Titus, a 
junior center for Loara; Jinelle Williams, a junior center for Brea-Olinda; 
Leslie Rathbun, a senior guard for Woodbridge, and Olivia DiCamilli, a freshman 
guard for Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
GUARD 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Blackburn 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda * 5-8 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
The emotional leader of the Lady Cats, Blackburn overcame major back and 
shoulder surgery in 1987 to emerge as the team's best defender and open court 
player. A two-time all-county selection and an all-state guard, she averaged 
13.6 points, 3.8 assists and 3.5 steals. She will play for San Diego State in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
CENTER 
</P>
<P>
Sara Bone 
</P>
<P>
El Toro * 5-11 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
Bone brought the moves, agility and quickness of a forward -- her natural 
position -- to the post for El Toro, which needed a center. Her versatility 
enabled her to power up inside or shoot from three-point range. She led El Toro 
in scoring (18.1 points) and rebounding (10.4). Bone, an honor student, will 
play at Dartmouth in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
GUARD 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Fischer 
</P>
<P>
Edison * 5-6 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
Fischer set a national record for three-pointers with 105 this season. The old 
reported record was 85. She also set a reported Southern Section record for 
most three-point baskets in a game (10). Fischer, MVP of the Marina tournament, 
led Edison (17-9) to the 4-AA quarterfinals. She averaged 21.8 points, 4.5 
assists and had 115 career three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
GUARD 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Harney 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza * 5-9 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
Harney was the county's most versatile big guard this season. "She can play 
point guard or center on offense and she can guard a perimeter or post player 
on defense," Coach Marc Hill said. Harney averaged 16.6 points, 5.8 rebounds 
and 3.7 assists to lead her team to the Empire League title. 
</P>
<P>
FORWARD 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jalewalia 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta * 6-1 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia led state in scoring (31.2 points) last season and was second this 
year (33.0). In four years she scored 2,205 points, 71 shy of the county record 
set by Paula Tezak at La Habra (1980-84). Jalewalia, who will attend UCLA, set 
county single-game scoring record (60 points) and led La Quinta to 4-A title. 
</P>
<P>
GUARD 
</P>
<P>
Aimee McDaniel 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda * 5-6 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel led Brea-Olinda to two Southern Section titles, the state Division III 
championship last season, another appearance in the state final this year and a 
national ranking (fourth). She led Brea-Olinda in scoring (16.4 points) and 
assists (6.4) and is a three-time all-county selection. 
</P>
<P>
CENTER 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Rohrig 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo * 6-3 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
Rohrig, a two-time selection, led the county in rebounding with a 20.1 average 
and averaged 21.2 points. Her mobility made her a formidable shot blocker (5.8 
average) and a force on the offensive boards. Rohrig, all-league in volleyball, 
plans to attend Duke on a volleyball scholarship in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
GUARD 
</P>
<P>
Melisa Sortino 
</P>
<P>
Marina * 5-7 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
Sortino's leadership and scoring helped Marina to a second-place finish in the 
Sunset League. Sortino, a prolific three-point shooter -- she made 64 -- led 
Marina in scoring (20.4 points) and assists (5.1). Sortino, the co-MVP of the 
Sunset League with Ocean View's Jenny Sullivan, will attend the University of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
CENTER 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Sullivan 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View * 6-3 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, the Sunset League MVP the last two seasons, led Ocean View in scoring 
(17.3) and rebounding (14.7). At 6-3, 180 pounds, she did it all, from scoring 
to rebounding to shot blocking. She has narrowed her college choices to Loyola 
Marymount, Cal State Dominguez Hills and Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
GUARD 
</P>
<P>
Karie Yoshioka 
</P>
<P>
El Toro * 5-4 * Senior 
</P>
<P>
Injuries slowed Yoshioka as a junior. But the point guard was healthy this 
season, excelling at the transition game and three-point shooting. She hit 
close to 50% from three-point range, led the county in assists (8.4) and 
averaged 16.5 points. She led her team to the South Coast League title and was 
league MVP.

CalComp on View: The most common use of sophisticated computer graphics, 
though, remains the design and modeling of projects ranging from integrated 
circuits to automobiles and buildings. Hardly any significant product is now 
built without it first taking shape as a computer simulation. 
</P>
<P>
One local company that's been a great beneficiary of this trend is 
Anaheim-based CalComp. The company was a pioneer in the development of graphics 
plotters -- the sophisticated printers necessary to make hard copies of fancy 
graphics -- and it continues to lead the market. CalComp, which also makes 
"digitizers" that convert drawings into computer language and many graphics 
display products, introduced a number of new products Monday, including a 
high-end plotter selling for $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest news at CalComp is that it may not be a Lockheed Corp. 
subsidiary much longer. Lockheed was going to sell the $500-million company 
last year, then decided to keep it. But Texas financier Harold Simmons, who has 
launched a proxy fight for control of Lockheed, "may have other ideas," a 
CalComp spokesman said Monday.

COMPUTER GRAPHICS CONVENTION FOCUSES ON IMAGE INNOVATIONS

The goal of computer graphics, Hewlett-Packard executive Lewis E. Platt 
declared in his opening address to the National Computer Graphics Assn. 
convention in Anaheim on Monday, must be to create images that are "better than 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
A tall order, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
But not quite as absurd as it sounds. What's better than being able to see an 
object? Being able to see into the middle of it, to see it in different light, 
to see it from any angle -- all at the touch of a button. And while the images 
on the screens in Anaheim were not quite as good as photos, they were being 
twirled and flipped and turned inside out with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the companies at the show, including Irvine-based Zenographics Inc., 
focus on software systems that can turn personal computers into graphics 
machines. These products allow the creation of fancy-looking reports, for 
example, at a modest price -- $295 to $1,700 for the Zenographics software. 
Laser-graphics, also of Irvine, sells products that let you put the graphic 
images straight onto slides. 
</P>
<P>
But other graphics applications are far more demanding. Silicon Graphics, a 
Mountain View, Calif., firm with nearly $400 million in revenue, sells its 
high-powered graphics processors for $95,000. They are used for such things as 
flight simulators: a computer-generated image of an airplane flying through 
computer-generated mountains and valleys, responding just as a plane would to a 
touch of the controls. 
</P>
<P>
These capabilities are gradually becoming accessible, even to smaller 
companies. For example, the low-end Silicon Graphics system is really a 
"super-PC" that sells for about $15,000. "People want to visualize their work," 
said Deborah Miller, a Silicon Graphics vice president. "Visual processing will 
do for images what word processing did for words and data processing did for 
numbers."

SPRING MOUNTAIN GROUP OF NEWPORT BUYS PIONEER S&amp;L

<TEXT>
<P>
Abandoned twice by suitors in recent years, Orange County's smallest thrift, 
Pioneer Savings &amp; Loan, finally has tied the knot with the Spring Mountain 
Group in Newport Beach, the new owner disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Spring Mountain, whose primary subsidiary is Spring Mountain Escrow Corp., won 
state and federal regulatory approvals late last week to purchase Pioneer, said 
Christine Sanderson, the group's president. The new owner will take control 
next Monday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Bacon, a former Downey Savings &amp; Loan executive who ran Butterfield 
Savings &amp; Loan for regulators while it was in receivership, will be 
Pioneer's new president, Sanderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson did not reveal the price, but she said Pioneer's book value at the 
end of February was about $350,000. As part of the deal, federal regulators 
required Spring Mountain to put $3 million into the S&amp;L's capital base, its 
final reserve against losses, to revive the troubled institution. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer has not had a profitable year since it opened in 1985. The S&amp;L's 
assets dropped to $14.6 million at the end of September from a high of $22.2 
million in December, 1986. It lost $325,000 for the first nine months last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson said Pioneer will now look for a branch to buy in the Newport Beach 
or Laguna Beach area and move out of its second-floor offices in Newport 
Center, a location that isn't conducive to gathering deposits from walk-in 
customers. The new owner plans to change the S&amp;L's name, possibly to 
Southern Cities Bank, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer's lending initially will focus on residential loans for those who buy 
the homes built by Spring Mountain Escrow's builder clients, Sanderson said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Spring Mountain and Pioneer will be indemnified for any 
damages in pending litigation between Pioneer's lone shareholder, Palm Springs 
builder James Deane, and seven others over the financing for the S&amp;L's 
start-up five years ago. That litigation has thwarted two other attempts to 
sell the institution.

HELMET WOULD MAGNIFY WORK FOR SURGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do jet fighter pilots and surgeons have in common? They both try to keep 
their attention riveted on their jobs and dislike distractions. 
</P>
<P>
Fighter pilots make use of a technology that projects information from the 
control panels of their jets onto the faceplates of their helmets, enabling 
them to see vital flight data at all times without taking their gaze off the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
A start-up company in San Clemente called FMX Vision Inc. hopes to incorporate 
a similar technology in a helmet for surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cornett, president and chief executive of the firm, said it is developing 
a helmet with two miniature cameras that will produce highly magnified 
three-dimensional pictures of anatomy during surgery. 
</P>
<P>
He said the helmet is intended to replace clumsy and distracting microscopes. 
Microsurgery is an expanding field of medicine, he said, as neuro- and 
orthopedic surgeons learn to work with minute nerves and blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
The product is the brainchild of Dr. John Frazee, associate professor of 
neurosurgery at the UCLA School of Medicine and chief of neurosurgery at 
Wadsworth Veterans Hospital, and Roger Malcolm, president of EOT, a San 
Clemente firm that makes specialized surgical products. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, FMX has raised $280,000 from investors for development. The 
principal investor is Ray Williams, a Palo Alto entrepreneur who specializes in 
starting medical and computer firms. Cornett said the firm is courting venture 
capital companies in an effort to raise another $1.5 million to complete 
development of a prototype. 
</P>
<P>
The system FMX is developing, Cornett said, would use a computer to magnify and 
perhaps color the image taken by tiny video cameras mounted on a helmet above a 
surgeon's eyes. It might be used, for instance, to provide a sharp picture of a 
tumor to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
At a surgeon's voice command, the magnified and clarified image would be 
projected onto a portion of the front plate of his helmet. Once the surgeon got 
his bearings, he could issue yet another command that would make the 
magnification disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Besides giving the surgeon a magnified vision of his work in progress, the 
computer could store early diagnostic images of a patient that could be 
projected on the helmet face for the surgeon to study, Cornett said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to invent anything," he said. "The miniature cameras are 
available, the miniature cath-ray tubes are available and the imaging 
processing technology is available. We just have to put them together in a 
system." 
</P>
<P>
He said similar helmets might also replace low-power microscopes used by 
quality control inspectors in the assembly of medical devices and electronic 
components. And manufacturers could maintain video archives of on-line 
inspections that could be referred to when a malfunction occurs. 
</P>
<P>
HEADS-UP HELMET FOR MICROSURGEONS 
</P>
<P>
Engineers at FMX Vision of San Clemente have designed a helmet that gives 
surgeons the next best thing to microscopic eyes. Camera lenses mounted in a 
lightweight helmet generate stereoscopic images, magnified up to 25 times, 
which are projected onto the inside of the helmet's faceplate. 
</P>
<P>
Microsurgery is typically performed using binocular microscopes controlled by 
foot pedals. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of voice-controlled lenses mounted in the helmet designed by FMX Vision 
display a magnified image on the inside of the faceplate.

COUNTY CHAMBER ORCHESTRA PUTS ON THE DOG FOR ORANGE CONCERT 
</P>

The Orange County Chamber Orchestra closed its Sunday concert with a bow. Two 
bows. Actually, two bow-wows. They were listed in the program, along with 
musical personnel, under Hunde: Kaela, die Hunde Principal; and Bruno. And, 
though the orchestra and the day's featured guests Jeanne and Sidney Weiss gave 
their polished all, it was a dog day afternoon at St. Joseph Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion for Kaela and Bruno's contributions was Leopold Mozart's "Hunt" 
Symphony, a good-natured romp that sports an opening movement full of barking 
hounds and gunshots (in this case, cap-gun shots from toy rifles wielded by 
jungle fatigue-clad marksmen). But for this performance, presumably remembering 
the adage that animal acts are hard to follow, music director Micah Levy 
swapped this movement with the closing minuet. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber orchestra backed Papa Mozart's shenanigans with implacable elegance 
and a dignity that belied the hilarity yet to come. Horns -- Jon Titmus, Mark 
Adams, Diane Muller and Kurt Snyder -- handled the obligatory parallel calls in 
the first and third movements with admirable control of intonation and 
ornamentation even after the workout they had just finished in Handel's 
Concerto for Two Choirs. 
</P>
<P>
The horns had already met the challenge of typical Baroque stratospheric lines 
in Handel's showcase for antiphonal wind ensembles. Here, the wind choirs -- 
led by oboists Peter Scott and Marni Hougham, hornists Titmus and Muller, and 
bassoonist David Muller; answered by Kathy Del Russo and Electra Reed, oboes, 
Adams and Snyder, horns, and Andrew Kline, bassoon -- conversed in crisp, 
energetic dialogue. Scott, in particular, distinguished himself with a stylish, 
engaging oboe solo in the Larghetto section of the third movement (which Levy 
led as an Allegretto contrast to the movement's introductory Andante). 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the clean, light balance that marked the second half of the 
program, Chausson's Concert for Piano, Violin and String Quartet was muddled by 
performance with string orchestra rather than quartet. By exploiting 
pretensions to concerto status, this arrangement sacrificed the inherent 
transparency of chamber music, exchanging, for example, ponderous bottom lines 
for what should have been lush, dark underpinnings. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the replacement sent the soloists into unfortunate competition with 
the strings. In the Sicilienne, Jeanne Weiss' piano was lost while Sidney 
Weiss' violin fought for supremacy in what is otherwise a lilting, poignant 
song. And while far from insensitive to interpretive demands, the Weisses 
proved themselves ill-matched for this work by contrasting a wide Romantic 
violin sweep against a too-delicate pianism.

Centuries ago, Rome had the spectacle of the Coliseum, where they fed 
Christians to the lions. Nowadays, Southern California has the spectacle of the 
Crystal Cathedral, where they feed miracles to the Christians. 
</P>
<P>
"What you hear and see tonight is the staging of a historical truth. . . ." So 
we are assured by the canned voice of the Rev. Robert H. Schuller as a preamble 
to "The Glory of Easter," which opened Friday and continues through April 21 at 
the cavernous, glass-walled church. 
</P>
<P>
On the evidence of this show, Karl Marx was wrong when he claimed that religion 
is the opiate of the masses. Instead, it's a theme park, with flying angels and 
laser beams, blinding flashes of lightning and angry thunder that alternately 
rumbles like an earthquake and cracks like a whip. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing much has changed from last year's "Glory" except some of the principal 
players. Producer-director Paul David Dunn's conception remains as piously 
grandiose as ever -- the theatrical equivalent of an epic movie by Cecil B. 
DeMille -- replete with a colossal cast of nearly 200 people and a menagerie of 
horses, donkeys, lambs and a leashed tiger. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Fuller returns in the role of Jesus, unstintingly beatific until he 
undergoes the agonies of a grimly realistic Crucifixion, when he is called upon 
to project spiritual as well as physical despair. Kim Criswell (of "Cats" fame) 
is back again as Mary the Mother with the show's most human moments, brief 
though they are, and a soaring solo entitled "Because He Lives." 
</P>
<P>
For all the bravura spectacle -- and partly because of the outsize staging -- 
"The Glory of Easter" suffers from a major production flaw: disembodied voices. 
The miking makes it impossible to tell who is speaking much of the time, even 
with the help of a spotlight to focus attention on the main action. 
</P>
<P>
When your eye finally catches up with your ear, you frequently lose the speaker 
again as the action shifts elsewhere across a vast distance to some other spot 
in the milling crowd. Ironically, this distraction invites you to close your 
eyes and simply listen, which is a little like going to the ballpark and not 
having a hotdog with all the trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
If you do close your eyes, though, you'll notice that "Glory" sounds like 
nothing so much as a small-scale radio drama. Minus the stage props, it could 
make a good companion to "The Green Hornet." 
</P>
<P>

Two priests have been named as the sixth and seventh auxiliary bishops of the 
sprawling Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, Archbishop Roger Mahony 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. Stephen E. Blaire, 48, the moderator of the curia and chancellor of the 
archdiocese, and Msgr. Sylvester D. Ryan, 59, were appointed bishops by Pope 
John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said the additions reflect the Pope's recognition of the growth of the 
archdiocese, which is home to about 3.5 million Catholics and sprawls over 
8,762 square miles of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.

DEATH OF CYPRESS GIRL IS UNDER INVESTIGATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's authorities said today that they suspect foul play 
in the death of a 16-year-old Cypress girl whose body was found covered with 
pine needles hours after she had been reported missing by her parents. 
</P>
<P>
The fully clothed body of Zuleima Valdez was discovered at 5:45 p.m. Monday by 
two teen-agers riding bicycles in a dirt area on the east side of the Coyote 
Creek flood control channel bike path, Sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said. The 
channel marks the border between Cypress and Lakewood, as well as the boundary 
separating Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
There were no visible signs of trauma to the body, Wahla said. However, the 
body appeared to be covered with pine needles in an amount more than normal for 
that area, which has sparked an investigation by the sheriff's homicide 
division. No further details will be available until an autopsy is completed 
this week, Wahla added. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's body was found in a concave dirt area 56 feet north of the bike path 
and about 200 yards from the intersection of Carson and Centralia streets in 
Lakewood. The location is about 20 feet east of pine trees that rim Forest Lawn 
Memorial-Park in Cypress, Wahla said. 
</P>
<P>
Zuleima was a freshman at Cypress High School, said Principal Jack D. Weber, 
who described her as an average to above-average student who was quiet and 
well-behaved. The school flag flew at half-staff today in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
The girl moved to Cypress from New York about two years ago, said Pat Savage, 
principal of Lexington Junior High School, where Zuleima attended eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents reported her missing to Cypress police at 1:25 a.m. Monday, Lt. 
John Schaefer said. She was last seen at 9:30 p.m. Sunday, when she left her 
home with a friend to go to the beach, Wahla said.

<P>
Northbound lanes of the Golden State Freeway in Burbank were closed for about 
five hours this morning after a big-rig collided with a tanker hauling diesel 
fuel, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
A small amount of the fuel from the tanker spilled when the trucks collided at 
the Alameda Avenue exit about 1:36 a.m., the CHP said. The drivers of the 
trucks suffered only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP closed the freeway while about 9,000 gallons of diesel fuel were pumped 
from that tanker into another one. The freeway was opened shortly before 7 
a.m., but early-morning traffic was already backed up for three miles, the CHP 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is under investigation.

<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Cabinet today agreed to begin scrapping special 
benefits for East German settlers in an attempt to stop them from flooding into 
West Germany, a government official said. 
</P>
<P>
The government said it will close reception camps and scrap cash handouts 
starting in July to stop an exodus that has brought half a million immigrants 
from East Germany in the last 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn simultaneously tried to reassure East Germans by telling them that their 
virtually worthless currency should be replaced by the West German mark this 
summer as a prelude to unification. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the government will ask Parliament to 
repeal a 1950 law under which 4.5 million people have been resettled in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
He said the introduction of currency, economic and social union between the two 
Germanys by this summer will give East Germans an incentive to stay at home. 
</P>
<P>
"With these measures, the need for a reception procedure will disappear," he 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble said the reception camps that house East Germans until they have 
found a permanent home will close starting July 1. 
</P>
<P>
From the same date, East Germans will no longer receive handouts of $120 in 
cash and cheap loans of up to $2,400 to buy furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Until economic and social union, settlers will remain entitled to "assimilation 
money" of about $600 a month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is aimed at encouraging East Germans to stay home and help rebuild 
their country and to relieve the burden East German resettlers are putting on 
West German social services. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet move came two days after East Germany's first free election in 
which a conservative alliance allied to Kohl's party won. The winners are still 
negotiating on forming a coalition East German government that will help set 
the pace for unifying the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's elections, East Germans gave 48% of the vote to a conservative 
coalition actively backed by Kohl that promises quick unification. After the 
victory, Kohl appealed to East Germans to stay home. He repeated the message 
Monday night on West German television. 
</P>
<P>
"Please stay home," the chancellor said in an interview with the ZDF network. 
"Unpack your bags. Go back to the factories and offices, and help in building 
up the country." 
</P>
<P>
A new ZDF poll released hours after East Germany's election said only 13% of 
West Germans still welcome their compatriots from the East now that they have 
freely chosen a government. The poll showed 43% of West Germans have no 
understanding for the continued exodus, and more than half want to cut aid to 
the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Bremen, one of the 11 West German states, said it will not help East Germans 
find housing. The local government said that its camps for East Germans are 
overflowing and that it will accept only those who find their own housing. 
</P>
<P>
Bremen Mayor Herbert Schmalstieg urged the federal government to close 
reception centers for the refugees and send back all East Germans who cannot be 
housed by local communities.

PERES NAMED TO FASHION NEW ISRAELI GOVERNMENT

<P>
President Chaim Herzog today named Labor Party leader Shimon Peres as Israel's 
prime minister-designate and gave him the difficult task of trying to form a 
new government. 
</P>
<P>
Israel television broadcast live coverage of Herzog giving a letter of 
nomination to the 66-year-old Peres, who headed Israel's government in 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli law left Herzog with the authority to choose a candidate for prime 
minister. Peres has six weeks to form a new ruling coalition, but it was not 
certain he would be able to bring together his leftist allies and conservative 
religious factions. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog met over the past two days with leaders of Israel's two major parties to 
decide who has the best chance of forming a new governing coalition. A reversal 
by a key religious faction Monday left Labor and the right-wing Likud at a 
draw, with 60-60 support in the 120-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party is technically Parliament's largest faction, with 39 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, whose Likud bloc has 35 seats, fell in 
a parliamentary vote of no confidence last Thursday, triggered by a dispute 
over Middle East peace moves. 
</P>
<P>
An official in Herzog's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 
president's office has been inundated with phone calls from Israelis 
complaining that the wheeling and dealing has paralyzed the government. 
</P>
<P>
"People say it is impossible to bear the political situation," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel radio said Herzog, mirroring these sentiments, told some politicians 
Monday that "the Israeli public is fed up with politicians." 
</P>
<P>
The radio said Herzog's office also received a number of anonymous telephone 
threats today, including one bomb threat. Police searched and found no 
explosives, the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the maneuvering has involved small ultra-Orthodox religious parties, 
notably the Shas faction whose spiritual leader, 69-year-old Rabbi Ovadia 
Yosef, caused the fall of Shamir's Likud-Labor coalition last week. 
</P>
<P>
Yosef said he ordered Shas to withhold support from Shamir because his 
government was unable to move forward in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
But he reversed his stand Monday after a talk with his mentor, 92-year-old 
Rabbi Eliezer Shach, and a scolding from the nation's two chief rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israel welcomed the idea of peace talks with its most 
implacable foe, Syria, but said the goal should be an overall peace treaty 
rather than a proposed demilitarized zone in the occupied Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Jimmy Carter, who met Syrian President Hafez Assad last week, 
told reporters Sunday that Syria is ready for "bilateral talks with Israel, 
including the Golan Heights."

French actress Capucine, who played the slinky seductress in the first "Pink 
Panther" movie, jumped to her death from her eighth-floor apartment, police 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old actress, who starred in movies with such Hollywood stars as 
John Wayne, Stewart Granger and Peter Sellers, took her life Saturday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss media said friends who knew her since she moved to Lausanne on Lake 
Geneva 28 years ago reported that she had lately been ill and depressed. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Toulon, France, as Germaine Lefebvre, Capucine first studied painting 
and then became a model. She won Hollywood fame in films of the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful, tall and dark-haired, Capucine was the slinky femme fatale in the 
first of the "Pink Panther" comedy films with Sellers playing the loony French 
police inspector. 
</P>
<P>
She chose the stage name Capucine from the French for an exotic ornamental 
South American flower with large petals that are typically orange.

Prosecutors rested their case against John M. Poindexter today, 12 days into 
his Iran-Contra trial on charges of lying to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The government, represented by independent Iran-Contra prosecutors, called 10 
witnesses against Poindexter before ending its presentation shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's final two witnesses were an FBI agent, who earlier testified 
about her interview with Poindexter after he resigned in November, 1986, and a 
former aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee who met with Poindexter in 
late November, 1986, as the Iran-Contra scandal was emerging in public view. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, said the first defense witness would be a 
White House lawyer. Beckler's strategy has been clear all along -- Poindexter 
was only doing Ronald Reagan's bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Beckler plans to play videotaped testimony from Reagan, but has not said when 
the star witness will appear on a television monitor.

The White House today voiced concern about Soviet troop movements on the border 
of Lithuania, saying that "intimidation and increasing tension" would 
complicate matters between the Kremlin and the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
"We just think there are certain indications here that we have to be concerned 
with," said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Fitzwater said the United States has been assured by Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other leaders that Moscow will not use force 
in Lithuania. "We believe those are the operating policies and feelings of the 
Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
In Namibia, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said today that 
Moscow "will not use force in the Baltic Republics. This is what I've been 
saying all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's Parliament voted on March 11 to secede from the Soviet Union and 
restore the independence it enjoyed before being forcibly annexed in 1940. Four 
days after the vote to secede, the Soviet Parliament declared the decree 
invalid but also did not specify measures Moscow might take to prevent 
Lithuania's succession. 
</P>
<P>
The White House statement reflected a deepening sense of concern amid reports 
of Soviet troop movements over the last 24 hours. According to some accounts, 
the troop movements have been associated with protecting government facilities 
such as power plants and other utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater issued the statement after Bush told reporters he hopes Lithuania 
will experience peaceful change and self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was asked by reporters at the outset of a meeting with congressional 
leaders if he is concerned that Gorbachev might order a military crackdown on 
the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that they're still talking peaceful change. That's essential," Bush 
said. "That's what everybody wants to see is peaceful evolution in Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, reading from a prepared statement, said the United States "has 
consistently supported the Baltic peoples' right to peaceful 
self-determination." Moreover, he said the Lithuanian government has expressed 
a willingness to negotiate with Moscow over its economic interests in the 
Baltic state. 
</P>
<P>
"We also note repeated Soviet statements that negotiations, not force, are the 
proper course in this situation," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lithuania's president denied Kremlin accusations that his Baltic 
republic plans to seize state enterprises and sell them to private owners. 
</P>
<P>
Vytautas Landsbergis, speaking before the republic's Parliament in Vilnius on 
Monday, said Moscow's statements were based on mistaken information, according 
to television editor Eduardas Potashinskas, who monitored the session. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that we are going to pass state-owned enterprises to private 
owners," Landsbergis was quoted as saying.

Operators at the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant began start-up 
procedures early today that will bring the $6.5-billion reactor to full power 
in about three months, a plant spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial plant's reactor was started at 3:59 a.m. 
</P>

Seabrook received its full-power license Thursday after a federal appeals court 
rejected a request for a stay by plant opponents.

<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to approve a full-power license for 
Seabrook on March 1.

"Operators today began the process of bringing the reactor up to the 3% power 
level for initial testing of plant systems," said Ron Sher, spokesman for New 
Hampshire Yankee, which operates the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Sher said after testing is completed at the 3% level, plant operators will 
gradually increase the reactor power levels in increments to 30%, 50%, 75% and 
100% power over the next two or three months.

Honda Motor Co. said today it has developed inertial navigation equipment for 
automobiles that always provides accurate information to the driver. 
</P>
<P>
The major Japanese automobile maker said the new system combines navigation 
technology such as one used for aircraft and a map database system using a 
compact disk. 
</P>
<P>
The distance driven is measured by the Vehicle Speed Sensor and the changes in 
direction are measured by the high-precision Gas Rate Sensor to calculate the 
route traveled, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The route traveled is continually checked against the road information stored 
on the compact disk. 
</P>
<P>
The current location and direction and the route traveled are displayed on a 
road map on a 6-inch color cathode ray tube display, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle's position and its direction are displayed in the center of the 
map, and the route traveled is displayed as a dotted line. When the destination 
is designated, the travel direction is shown by a solid line and the distance 
as the crow flies is shown in kilometers, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the map database on a single compact disk contains most 
information needed for ordinary driving such as the names of prefectures 
(states) and cities, intersections and public and leisure facilities, which are 
displayed in a color scheme.

TRADE GAP IN STEEP 20.5% CLIMB IN JAN.

<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, bloated by a record demand for foreign oil, worsened 
dramatically in January, climbing 20.5% to $9.3 billion, the government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said most of the deterioration came from a 44% surge in 
oil shipments. The January deficit was up from a $7.7-billion imbalance in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The trade report for January was an ominous beginning for the new decade. Many 
analysts believe America's trade woes will worsen in coming years as U.S. 
dependence on foreign oil grows. 
</P>
<P>
For January, exports climbed to an all-time high of $32.1 billion, 4% above the 
December level. 
</P>
<P>
However, this gain was swamped by a 7.3% surge in imports, which increased to 
$41.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit was the largest since a $10.1-billion imbalance in November. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit has been improving for the past two years, falling to 
$109 billion last year, down 8% from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But many economists predicted the 1990 deficit could begin rising again because 
of the oil bill and gains in the value of the dollar. A stronger U.S. currency 
makes imports cheaper for Americans and U.S. products less competitive on 
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
The huge 44% surge in oil imports did not come as a surprise, with analysts 
blaming the rise on December's record cold weather, which caused oil companies 
to import heavily in January to restock depleted supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The total volume of oil, 291,278 barrels, was an all-time high, topping a 
previous record set in August. 
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute has reported that foreign oil accounted for a 
record 54% of consumption in January as domestic production fell to its lowest 
level in a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor swelling the deficit in January was a 31% surge in imports of 
clothing, which totaled $3.1 billion in January. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the deficit with Japan was the largest of any country. However, at 
$2.9 billion, it was at the lowest level since December, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has been pressing the Japanese to do more to purchase 
U.S. exports as a way of reducing the huge annual deficit of $49 billion that 
America is running with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting company, said he was looking 
for the deficit for all of 1990 to total between $120 billion and $125 billion, 
which would make it the second worst imbalance in history. The all-time high 
was a $152.1 billion deficit in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a weaker dollar, we are just not going to get an improvement in 
trade," Evans said.

A man who acted as an adviser in numerous corporate takeovers pleaded guilty 
today to stealing $1 million from his proxy solicitation firm between 1987 and 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Donald C. Carter, suspended chairman of The Carter Organization Inc., also 
pleaded guilty to falsifying personal state income taxes and falsifying tax 
returns, said Ronald Goldstock, director of the state Organized Crime Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
Carter entered the plea before Justice George F. Roberts in state Supreme Court 
in Manhattan, although the announcement was made at the task force offices. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 41, of Old Brookville, faces up to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims of his thefts were many of the nation's largest and 
best-known companies, including Union Carbide Corp., Shell Oil and Caesar's 
World Inc. 
</P>
<P>
According to Goldstock, Carter routinely billed his clients for nonexistent or 
inflated expenses between 1984-89, supplying false information to justify the 
bogus invoices. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has agreed to establish a $1-million escrow fund to make restitution to 
the victims.

NBC WINS WEEK, BUT 'VIDEOS' KEEPS ROLLING

"America's Funniest Home Videos" and Marshal Matt Dillon were in the prime time 
top 10 last week, with "The Simpsons" almost making the elite group, it was 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won for the week, as usual. CBS came in second in its seesaw battle with 
ABC, which was third. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "Videos," one of two authentic hits of the season, topped the list the 
previous week and last week was the second most-watched show, beaten only by 
NBC's "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
The season's other hit, "The Simpsons," was in 11th place, the highest rating 
ever for a Fox show. The goofy real-life families on "Videos" are working as a 
lead-in for the goofy cartoon "The Simpsons," as a sizable chunk of ABC's 
"Videos" audience switches channels to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
They certainly aren't sticking around for ABC's "Elvis," which was tied for 
58th. 
</P>
<P>
The top movie of the week was "Gunsmoke: The Last Apache" on CBS, which tied 
for seventh, way ahead of "Phantom of the Opera," Part 1, on NBC, in a tie for 
41st, and ABC's "Love and Lies," ranked 47th. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Pauley's first NBC News special since she left the "Today" show, 
"Changes," tied for 33rd and was the highest-rated news special on any network 
since NBC's "Bad Girls" in August, 1989. "Bad Girls" was anchored by Deborah 
Norville, the new "Today" co-host. 
</P>
<P>
On a night-by-night basis, NBC took Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, 
ABC won Tuesday and Friday and CBS won Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC did not come in third on any night -- not even on Friday, long the 
network's problem period. Part of the credit goes to "Nasty Boys," which beat 
CBS's "Dallas" -- the first time a regular series has gotten the best of J. R. 
Ewing since "Miami Vice" did it in December, 1987.

FOX SHOWS HIT TOP 10 IN L.A. NIELSENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Nielsen ratings for Los Angeles, two Fox network shows placed in the top 10, 
"The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children" -- their highest local ratings 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday night cartoon show finished third in local ratings for the week with 
a 24.2 rating, beaten only by Nielsen warhorses "Cheers," with a 27.4 rating 
and "The Cosby Show" with 26. Fourth was "60 Minutes" with 24.2. Fox's offbeat 
"Married" was seventh with 23. Fox programs are aired on KTTV, Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
Local ratings are an important gauge for Fox Network programs since the 
syndicated shows are not aired in all communities covered by the nationwide 
Nielsen ratings.

BARTY TO PAY; CLAIMS VICTORY

<P>
Actor Billy Barty claimed a victory even though a county Small Claims Court 
judge ordered him to pay one of his former writers $1,328. 
</P>
<P>
Barty said he considered Monday's decision a win because he didn't have to 
award 10% of future syndication profits for his show, "Short Ribbs," to 
writer-producer Bill Winckler. 
</P>
<P>
"It went fine, it went very good, I was very pleased at the judge's decision," 
Barty said by phone after he was ordered to pay Winckler $1,300 in disputed 
salary and $28 in court costs. Laughing about the stir the case caused, Barty 
added that the publicity hadn't hurt his career. "This has gotten about as much 
publicity as Zsa Zsa and I didn't even slap anybody," Barty said. "But I 
wouldn't slap anybody. I'd hit them in the knee." 
</P>
<P>
Winckler, who had sued Barty for $2,000, said he was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen episodes of "Short Ribbs," described as a "Saturday Night Live" for 
"little people," aired on Orange County-based cable station KDOC last fall.

LIZ SMITH: FONDA CZECHS OUT DRAMA IN FALLEN IRON CURTAIN

<P>
PEOPLE ARE talking about Jane Fonda's recent trip to Europe. She's been moving 
fast since the tumultuous events over there and plans a big movie which would 
co-star -- the fall of the Iron Curtain! 
</P>
<P>
Fonda recently spent time with Czechoslovakia's new president, playwright 
Vaclav Havel, and sees his life story -- especially the five years he spent in 
jail for dissident activities against communism -- as a heady brew for film. 
Fonda herself would portray Havel's wife, Olga. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE gabbing over what got left on the cutting room floor in the Barbara 
Walters "20/20" interview with NBC's Bryant Gumbel. 
</P>

The "Today" show host made it perfectly clear where he stands on rumors about 
taking a news anchor job, saying: "Tom Brokaw's doing a great job, so the job's 
not available . . . if it was available, there's no guarantee they'd come and 
ask me . . . nobody has asked me about it . . . I don't aspire to it . . . 
absolutely not. No, it's not me, Barbara, it's not me. I'm not necessarily sure 
I'd be good at it, because I think it's a different kind of talent than doing 
the 'Today' program. And . . . it just doesn't interest me." 
</P>
<P>
Is this definite enough for all you, we, us rumormongers? 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE flipping over this week's "If It Ain't Broke, Break It" story in 
Newsweek on the aftermath of the Jane Pauley-"Today" mess. They seem to be 
asking -- is Jane the Ivana Trump of the airwaves? Notable question: "The 
media's casting of Pauley as a kind of spurned wife has sent her popularity 
soaring." 
</P>
<P>
And here's another: "At least one NBC insider believes that Gumbel is trying to 
distance himself from the wreckage. . . . The same source also claims that 
Gumbel and Dick Ebersol have begun blaming Pauley for getting them into this 
mess. They're telling people, 'If Jane had just accepted things like a good 
soldier, none of this would have happened.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol is the producer who masterminded the importation of Deborah Norville -- 
he now claims he did it with Jane's acquiescence. And the "this" that happened, 
of course, was falling ratings, media hoopla and unhappy fallout. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE gabbing over On the Avenue's article about "The Two Mrs. Trumps," 
meaning Blaine and Ivana. The magazine asks, "Is blood thicker than Poland 
Spring?" 
</P>
<P>
Society has always gossiped about the wife of Robert and the wife of Donald and 
whether or not they are friends or rivals or what? Now I say -- give 'em a 
break. Both women are victims in this turn of events. I'm sure both Blaine and 
Ivana will "do the right thing" once and if ever they figure out what that is 
supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't spoken to Ivana in several weeks. But I am told that she now has a 
new, tougher attitude, has girded her loins for a real fight to protect herself 
and her children, and is beginning to see the light -- that there could 
possibly be life without Donald. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE flabbergasted by the New York Intelligencer's report on how Doris 
Day wants murderers -- rather than small animals -- used to test new AIDS 
drugs. "I can't bear anything innocent being used. I think they should 
experiment on murderers. . . . Why not? They owe society something. Don't stand 
aghast at that. They're sitting there having three meals a day, and we're 
paying for it. What the hell are they going to do for society to pay us back? 
They should do this for us." This report appeared originally in The Cable 
Guide.

Sports agent Lance Luchnick has refused to discuss published reports that he 
gave money to someone related to Alabama linebacker Keith McCants. 
</P>

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution today quoted an unidentified family member as 
saying, "Somebody in this family got money (from Luchnick), but it wasn't Keith 
or Momma (McCants' mother, Cindy). They haven't taken anything from anybody, 
from no agent. There weren't any handouts to this house."

McCants, expected to be chosen by the Atlanta Falcons with the first pick in

A Little Leaguer who died from heart failure after a wild pitch struck him in 
the chest had no history of heart problems, a doctor said. The autopsy showed 
that the impact of the ball stopped 10-year-old William Ryan Wojick's heart, 
the Hillsborough County medical examiner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
National Little League officials said it was only the second time in at least 
40 years that a child has died playing league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Wojick was at bat during the fourth inning of a game at the Citrus Park Little 
League field Sunday. He was struck in the upper left side of his chest and 
collapsed at home plate. The child was flown by helicopter to St. Joseph's 
Hospital when paramedics from a fire station next to the field could not revive 
him, a Sheriff's Office report says.

<P>
Pitcher Mike Krukow, the San Francisco Giants' only 20-game winner in the last 
17 years, announced his retirement today because of continuing shoulder 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Krukow, 38, became a free agent last October after a torn rotator cuff injury 
that ended his season in June. 
</P>
<P>
He was 4-3 with a 3.98 ERA during his shortened 1989 season and finished his 
career with a 124-117 record and a 3.90 ERA in 369 major-league games with the 
Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies and Giants. 
</P>
<P>
After going 20-9 in 1986 to become the Giants' first 20-game winner since Ron 
Bryant in 1973, Krukow was limited by recurring right shoulder problems and 
went only a combined 16-13 in his final three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get my shoulder back into shape this winter, but I just don't think 
it was meant to be," Krukow said from his Pasadena home. "I have no problem 
with this decision."

GOALIE BARRASSO TELLS OF DAUGHTER'S CANCER TREATMENT

<P>
Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso has returned to practice after spending the 
last six weeks in Los Angeles, where his 2 1/2-year-old daughter has been 
undergoing treatment for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Barrasso held a news conference Monday to discuss for the first time the burden 
he and his wife, Megan, have endured since the girl's condition was diagnosed 
July 1. He requested that the subject be placed off-limits after the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to look ahead, be positive and put the last six weeks behind us," 
Barrasso said. "Now that the immediate danger has passed, we'd like to get on 
with the rest of our lives. Her condition is the best it's been. She has a 50% 
chance for long-term survival. When she was diagnosed, they gave us a 15% 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Barrasso's daughter, Ashley, underwent chemotherapy and a Feb. 23 bone marrow 
transplant at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. She and her mother were 
expected to return to their Pittsburgh home Thursday, and Ashley will start a 
long recuperative program. 
</P>
<P>
"When she comes home we're going to go on the assumption that she's cancer-free 
and is going to grow up to be a normal, healthy kid," Barrasso said. "We may 
have to reevaluate that, but for now we're assuming she's healthy." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest scare in Ashley's treatment came when she had respiratory failure 
March 1 and had to be placed in the intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't look as though she was going to make it at that point," Barrasso 
said. "That was as terrified as I've ever been of anything in my life. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know adversity until you face it. No one in my family has died and 
no one very close to me has. We came close to it with my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
After Ashley's condition was diagnosed, Barrasso, 24, said he considered taking 
a year's leave from hockey. He decided to play and said his career helped keep 
some balance in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Barrasso broke his right hand four games into the season and wound up missing 
nearly two months. He returned Dec. 9 but said his concern about Ashley became 
more distracting after she underwent surgery in January. 
</P>
<P>
"That was when we knew she was going to have to go to Los Angeles," Barrasso 
said. "There was a reasonable chance she wasn't going to come back from Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
He received permission to leave the team Feb. 9 and said his family was boosted 
by cards and gifts from Penguins fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Until you go through something like this and have people support you the way 
my wife and I have been supported, you'll never know how much it meant to us," 
Barrasso said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrasso ran for conditioning during his time in California but said his 
balance and puck vision are lacking. He isn't sure if he'll be ready to play in 
any of the Penguins' last seven regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
Barrasso admitted that Ashley's illness has helped him place his career in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Hockey is the second most important thing in my life," he said. "My family is 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife is a very strong person. She had a baby through this, she's dealt with 
me as a professional athlete through this and I'm a very lucky man to be 
married to her. It's been very hard on our marriage but it's brought us much 
closer together. 
</P>
<P>
"(Ashley) has been a trouper. It's a very unfair thing for children to be sick. 
I don't think we could have asked for anything more from her. She's put up with 
all the treatments and done a better job than any adult would be capable of 
doing."

Darryl Strawberry was one of the first New York Mets to show up for work after 
word came that the lockout had ended. 
</P>
<P>
He says he isn't going to cause controversy anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry is coming off nearly a month of alcohol rehabilitation. That 
followed an incident in which he threatened his wife, Lisa, with a gun in their 
Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
The off-season was filled with troubled times for the 28-year-old outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry had the worst year of his career in 1989 and said on more than one 
occasion that he wanted to leave the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I look back at last year, and I really didn't have much motivation," 
Strawberry said. "I couldn't handle the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry hit .225 last season with 29 homers and 77 RBIs. Certainly not bad 
numbers, but not what the Mets expect from their cleanup man. 
</P>
<P>
"I locked myself in a corner and let my life get out of control. Never let 
anyone get close to me," he said. "But I've accepted what's happened. Now I'm 
prepared to help the Mets win a championship." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry was one of a few Mets who took batting practice on a damp Monday at 
the Mets' spring training complex. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't want to talk about his time in rehabilitation or about his marital 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a controversial person anymore," Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of spring training last year, Strawberry told the Mets that he 
wanted to renegotiate his contract. The Mets said no, and he walked out of camp 
for a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Strawberry took a swing at teammate Keith Hernandez just before 
the team picture was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry's contract expires at the end of the 1990 season and he is eligible 
to become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Mets General Manager Frank Cashen said that in order for Strawberry to join the 
$3-million club, he has to prove he deserves it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to play the 1990 season and see what happens," Strawberry said. 
"I just want baseball to be fun again." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry isn't promising a monster year, just a good one. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I can say," Strawberry said, "is that the guys who wrote me off last 
year, the guys who said I would be traded, they'll be in for a big surprise. 
I'm not going to say anything else. But they'll be surprised."

HUNGARIANS HANDLE U.S. IN SOCCER, 2-0

Tamas Petres and Zsolt Limperger scored as Hungary beat the United States, 2-0, 
tonight in a one-sided game that showed how much the Americans need to improve 
before the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians outplayed the Americans throughout the evening and dominated the 
action, just missing several other goals. 
</P>
<P>
The hosts used their superior quickness and ball-handling skills to overpower 
an American team playing its first game in Europe since qualifying for the 
World Cup finals, which begin June 8 in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
As 15,000 fans triumphantly waved red-white-and-green flags, the young 
Hungarian team kept the ball for long stretches in the American half of the 
field and took advantage of U.S. sloppiness. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians, six of whom were playing their first game for the national 
team, easily could have won by five or six goals. One Hungarian shot went off 
the crossbar and another off the goal post, and several other chances went 
astray in front of U.S. goalie Tony Meola. 
</P>
<P>
Petres, playing in his first international game, took a pass from Robert Jovan 
six minutes before halftime and scored the first goal from right in front of 
Meola. 
</P>
<P>
Limperger, who like Petres is 21, scored the other goal midway through the 
second half from 15 yards out after U.S. defender John Stollmeyer mistimed a 
header and the ball rolled free to Limperger. 
</P>
<P>
The lackluster U.S. offense, which scored only six goals in eight World Cup 
qualifying matches last year, did not get a shot on goal until the 35th minute 
of the game and showed little spark throughout the contest. 
</P>
<P>
The best scoring chance for the Americans came with six minutes remaining when 
Peter Vermes, who played last year in Raba Eto, Hungary, slammed a free kick 
that forced a diving save by Hungarian goalie Istvan Brockhauser. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the first of two games the U.S. team is playing in Eastern Europe 
to prepare for the World Cup finals.

Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash was dropped from the Australian Davis Cup

</P>
<P>
The four-man squad will face New Zealand in a World Group quarterfinal on March 
30 through April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said last Wednesday that Cash was under consideration for both singles 
and doubles in the quarterfinals, which will be played on a grass court at the 
Milton Tennis Center. Cash had not won a singles match for almost a year after 
undergoing surgery to repair an Achilles' tendon. His world ranking fell from 
fourth in May, 1988, to 627th. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser chose Mark Kratzmann to replaced the former Wimbledon champion.

UCONN'S SELLERS SAYS HE'LL BE READY

Like most basketball players, Rod Sellers probably dreamed of being on the 
floor with a championship on the line. 
</P>
<P>
In Sellers' case, however, the dream has become a little twisted. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers, the University of Connecticut's sophomore center, has wrenched his 
left knee three times in the past seven games. Each time, he has wound up on 
the floor, squirming with pain. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the deck again in UConn's second-round NCAA Tournament victory over UC 
Berkeley on Saturday. "It's getting frustrating, ending up on the floor every 
game," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't practice Monday, Sellers pronounced himself well enough to 
play against Clemson on Thursday in the NCAA East Regional semifinals at 
Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J. The winner of that game will face 
the winner of the UCLA-Duke game for a berth in the Final Four in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said he would practice today -- "All out," he said -- and is looking 
forward to tangling with Clemson's 6-foot-11 front-court stars, Elden Campbell 
and Dale Davis, known as the "Duo of Doom." 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt I'm playing," said Sellers, who has a partial tear of the medial 
collateral ligament. "There was less pain this time. It's a little stiff and I 
can't bend it all the way back, but I can run (and move laterally). . . . It's 
nothing serious, it just needs some rest." 
</P>
<P>
UConn Coach Jim Calhoun said Sellers could have re-entered the game against UC 
Berkeley, which the Huskies won by 20 points, but it was not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was this Thursday and the same thing happened, he probably would play," 
Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
That suits Sellers fine. He is from Florence, S.C., and grew up watching the 
Tigers on television. In fact, Clemson was high on Sellers' list when he was 
choosing a college. 
</P>
<P>
When Sellers visited Clemson, Campbell and 6-7 forward Sean Tyson showed him 
around. "I know those guys pretty well," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had 26 points and 17 of Clemson's 55 rebounds in the Tigers' 79-75 
victory over LaSalle on Saturday at the Civic Center. Tyson had 17 points and 
11 rebounds and Campbell, who fouled out, had seven points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"When they first put the (NCAA Tournament) brackets up I said, 'We're going to 
meet them sometime,' " Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers, who averages 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds, is wearing his third knee 
brace. He has used a white one and, for the sake of poetic justice, a black one 
and a blue one. He wants to get a darker blue brace to match his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had so many braces, I want to get one in every color," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Williams, UConn's junior forward, also will wear a knee brace Thursday, 
although it's not nearly as high-tech as Sellers'. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has a history of knee problems, had fluid drained from his right 
knee Monday and should be ready for the Clemson game. "There's been more and 
more swelling as he's taken some pounding down the stretch," Calhoun said. "He 
says it's going to be much better than it has in two weeks. You could see in 
the last couple of games, I thought, that he wasn't quite as quick as he has 
been." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (30-5) began preparing for Clemson (26-8) Monday with rebounding 
and general toughening-up drills. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun will begin tailoring specific offenses and defenses this afternoon. 
After practice, the team leaves for New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"You always try to attack big people (like Xavier did in beating Georgetown on 
Sunday)," Calhoun said. "We'll spread it out and attack, but we'll still 
attack."

TOKYO STOCKS PLUNGE AGAIN; TRADERS SEE NO END TO DECLINES

Tokyo stocks tumbled to a big loss Monday as the once-high flying Japanese 
market's key index fell another 4%, to bring the year's pullback to almost 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff continued early today: After plunging 1,353.20 points Monday, the 
Nikkei index dropped another 501.43 points by mid-morning today, to 30,761.81. 
It recovered somewhat by the mid-morning close, however, when it stood at 
31,106.57, off 156.67 points. 
</P>
<P>
The key question remained unanswered early in the day: Would the Bank of Japan 
raise interest rates again and by how much? 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei's Monday drop crashed it through the 32,000 mark for the first time 
in almost a year. The loss of 4.15% was the third-biggest daily fall in terms 
of points. 
</P>
<P>
Pessimism pervaded the Tokyo market after the drop and brokers were hard put to 
find any sign that an end to the declines was in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the most bearish weekly strategy meeting I've ever had this morning," 
said Andrew Ballingal, senior manager of the equities department at Barclays de 
Zoete Wedd in Japan. "I don't see anything in the domestic context or the 
external context to turn things around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said heavy computer sell programs contributed to the loss. Talk that 
some speculators had run into financial trouble and were unloading shares also 
unnerved the market. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts noted that the presence of the same bearish factors that have 
plagued the market since the start of this year: prospects of a weaker yen, 
higher interest rates, slower corporate profit growth and higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Such worries have lopped almost 20% off the Nikkei since the index ended 1989 
at a record high of 38,915.87. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, in point terms, the Nikkei has suffered six of its 10 worst 
drops. It plunged 1,569.10 points Feb. 26, its second-biggest one-day point 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
In percentage terms, Monday's slide wasn't one of the market's top 10 declines, 
but it did smash through a key psychological mark. 
</P>
<P>
"The fall today was really severe for the market," said Setuo Watanuki, a 
trader at Toyo Securities. "It seemed to have ripped through its resistance 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Support levels once seen at 32,000 have now been lowered to the 27,000-29,000 
range, but brokers seem to lack confidence that declines will necessarily halt 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kunio Misaki, a senior analyst at Nikko Securities, "It is very difficult 
to say, 'This is where the market will stop falling."' 
</P>
<P>
Some brokers said there was hope the market might improve, or at least 
stabilize, when trading for the new fiscal year starts on March 28. "Until the 
27th, it won't be a bright market," Misaki said. "After that, we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
The start of the new business year means the end of selling related to annual 
book closing, when year-ending accounts are settled for investment funds and 
new budgets take effect. Many foreign brokers who had felt over-exposed to 
Tokyo shares have already cut back their portfolios, some brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
But such factors are unlikely to fuel a rally as long as the yen is seen 
weakening and interest rates rising. "The key, really, is 'When does the yen 
bottom out and when do interest rates peak?"' Ballingal said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 153.55 yen and 1,6873 West German marks Monday, versus 
152.62 yen and 1.6990 marks at Friday's New York close. It was the dollar's 
highest close in Tokyo since March 12, 1987, when it closed at 153.69 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets in Tokyo have since January expected the Bank of Japan to 
raise the official discount rate again to defend the yen and curb inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank has not done so, partly due to opposition from the finance 
ministry, which worries that a rise would hurt the economy, and partly due to 
fears that a hike would damage stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Now the stock market fears that when the central bank does act, the rise will 
not be enough to bolster the yen, and another rise will have to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Early today, Japan's NHK TV reported that the Bank of Japan was planning an 
increase of 1 percentage point in the discount rate, to 5.25%, imminently. The 
central bank's embattled president, Yasushi Mieno, said early in the day that 
no decision had yet been made. 
</P>
<P>
Global interest rates have been rising in reaction to the demand for capital to 
cope with events in Eastern Europe, and the unification of Germany in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
This trend, combined with the view of many market experts that Tokyo share 
prices remain technically overvalued, gives stock market players little hope. 
</P>
<P>
"In their hearts, people don't think the market will rebound," said Yasushi 
Sakamoto, a fund manager at Toyo Trust and Banking. "Looking at the longer 
term, expectations for stock market growth are not very high." 
</P>
<P>
The pessimism has largely stayed inside Japan's borders, however, since the 
country's stock market has long been viewed as overvalued in comparison with 
other world markets.
