NOT FEELING AT HOME, LAKERS LOSE TO BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Laker habit of waiting until the last possible moment before commencing a 
spirited comeback, necessitated by a severe and prolonged fourth-quarter lull, 
was stretched to almost ridiculous proportions Tuesday night in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Procrastinators anonymous might be the answer, because the Lakers these days 
only seem to play well when the clock dwindles and their first-half lead has 
evaporated. This time, they trailed the Chicago Bulls by nine points with 2:42 
left before rallying for the fourth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Lakers about a minute and a half to catch the Bulls but, under 
uncommon circumstances, they could not overtake them and lost for the second 
straight time at home, 104-103, before a crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this season the Lakers have lost consecutive home 
games, but they did not have Magic Johnson when it happened in February. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Bulls swept the season series from the Lakers (45-20) for the 
first time since 1981, and the Lakers' hopes of catching the Cleveland 
Cavaliers or Detroit Pistons for the league's best record are growing dimmer. 
They trail Cleveland by three games, Detroit by two. 
</P>
<P>
These last two losses, particularly the manner in which they were absorbed, is 
a cause for alarm among the Lakers, who earlier had won two close games at home 
but lost in a similar manner to the Atlanta Hawks Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' comeback may have failed when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar missed a skyhook 
with three seconds to play and Byron Scott missed a long jump shot at the 
buzzer, but they really lost it after a lethargic four-minute stretch earlier 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "We're just not getting the 
job done. We're dying in the fourth quarter. I am totally mystified. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a pattern developing that I don't like. And I'm sure the players 
don't like it, either. Mentally, in the fourth quarter, we just aren't showing 
confidence. I never question their character, but we've got to have that 
passion we have at the end when we are still up by six points." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Lakers had a 91-86 lead with 8:08 to play after Michael Cooper 
made a jump shot. What followed, however, was a severe Laker drought in which 
they failed to score for nearly four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who received 21 points, a career-tying 16 assists and eight rebounds 
from Michael Jordan, took a 98-91 lead with a 12-0 run. The Lakers, during that 
stretch, missed all nine field goal shots. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson finally made two free throws with 4:25 to play, the Lakers 
trailed, 98-93. Soon thereafter, however, the Bulls would take a 102-93 lead 
after Jordan scored on a drive and center Bill Cartwright made a jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
After a Laker timeout with 2:42 to play, the comeback began in earnest, 
culminating in a 9-0 run that pulled the teams even with a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
A.C. Green got it going by scoring a three-point play after rebounding Cooper's 
miss and drawing a foul while making the follow shot. After Jordan missed a 
shot, Byron Scott took a length-of-the-court pass from Johnson and scored on a 
fast-break layup. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was fouled by Jordan on the play. The referees ruled it a breakaway foul, 
meaning the Lakers would retain the ball after Scott's free throw, which he 
made. Now down by three points, Scott drew another foul, but made only one free 
throw to cut Chicago's lead to 102-100. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers' half-court trap forced a missed shot by guard Craig Hodges, who 
had 21 points. On the Laker end, James Worthy and Johnson both had inside shots 
blocked, but the Lakers kept possession. Eventually, Worthy passed to Scott 
cutting through the lane for a layup to tie it, 102-102. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with 1:03 to play, it was the Bulls' turn to call time out and regroup. 
Naturally, they set up the play for Jordan, who was fouled by Worthy on a 
drive. Jordan made both free throws, regaining the lead for Chicago with 48 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers got the ball to Johnson, and he drew a foul on a jump shot with 37 
seconds left. But Johnson, who had not missed a free throw in the game, missed 
the second shot, making it 104-103 Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
On the Bulls' next possession, Hodges missed a jump shot and Cooper got the 
rebound with 17 seconds left, setting up a chance for the Lakers to win it with 
a final shot. 
</P>
<P>
Riley later said that Worthy was the first option, but the ball wound up in 
Abdul-Jabbar's hands with three seconds left. He was about 17 feet away from 
the basket, on the baseline, but had no choice but to shoot. His skyhook fell 
short, and Cartwright was fouled while getting the rebound with one second 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Even after all that, the Lakers still had a shot -- a final shot -- to win it. 
That's because Cartwright missed both free throws, giving the Lakers the ball 
at midcourt. Cooper inbounded to Scott in the corner, just beyond the 
three-point line. But Scott's jump shot failed, and so did the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand it," Johnson said. "We just don't shoot well in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been happening the last couple games. We've been playing great first 
halves, but we just can't find the hoop in the fourth quarter. We're even 
missing the close shots. Everybody, including myself, has to look and see what 
the reason is." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, whose defense forced Jordan to make just seven of 20 shots, seemed even 
more concerned by the Lakers' fourth-quarter fade, followed by a late rally. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting in the third quarter, it's like we're not aggressive anymore," Cooper 
said. "I'm baffled myself. We aren't putting it in gear. There were times in 
the fourth quarter tonight when we could have put it away, but we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely concerned, because we are losing games we should not be 
losing." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, however, deserved this one. No longer a one-dimensional team, the 
Bulls received 21 points each from Scottie Pippen and Hodges, as well as 
Jordan. Jordan's defense also forced Johnson into making seven turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Lakers) made it tough for me to get off a shot," Jordan said. "But that 
enabled me to distribute the ball, and our guys hit the big shots when 
necessary. Not many teams get to sweep the Lakers in a season, so this was 
big." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley, who already has a pretty fair point guard, said the 
Bulls definitely benefit with Michael Jordan as a point guard. "He can do 
anything," Riley said of Jordan. "That's why he's so great, because of his 
versatility. When defenses start denying him the ball, then they just put it in 
his hands earlier. He watches somebody and models them. In other words, he 
knows how to even look like a point guard, even though he's never played the 
position. He can execute point guard and run an offense. . . . I would have him 
at point guard all the time, because he can create and pass and run an 
offense." . . . Michael Cooper recovered from a one-day bout of stomach flu and 
returned to the team Tuesday night. . . . The Lakers are off today and play at 
Sacramento on Thursday night.

MORNING BRIEFING: A REPECHAGE FOR BALTIMORE? STARRY-EYED COLT FANS GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From Mike Littwin in the Baltimore Sun: "It was five years ago next Tuesday 
that Baltimore changed forever. On March 28, 1984, the moving trucks moved in 
by cover of night and stole away with a football team and a city's soul. 
</P>
<P>
"The Colts have come and gone; Baltimore lost the never-quite-Baltimore 
Cardinals before it ever had them, and the city remains in a limbo of expansion 
dreams that may never come true. 
</P>
<P>
"So, now when Baltimore hears that they're talking about bringing an exhibition 
game to soon-to-be-antiquated Memorial Stadium this summer, the fans are not 
sure how to take the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this the NFL putting Baltimore on trial, when it seems as if it should be 
the other way around? Or is this game simply an opportunity, however brief, to 
see pro football in person again while, at the same time, taking a small step 
or two toward a new life in the NFL? 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that Baltimore will embrace the contest, should it be played. In a 
sporting sense, Baltimore is a grown-up town, with no stars remaining in 
anybody's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Frank White, the Kansas City Royals' second baseman, played in 150 
games last season, did not make a fielding error and made only four throwing 
errors. But who won the Gold Glove? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it is English: The sport is irrelevant, the author unimportant, but could 
anything be more descriptive? 
</P>
<P>
"Towards the end, as Wales with a grizzly, grinning cruelty continued to apply 
the sadistic, psychological thumbscrews on another wretched and inevitable 
England cock-up at Cardiff, you wondered if the Lions' selectors up in the 
stand were themselves squirming in embarrassment and tearing up their team 
sheets for the summer's tour of Australia." 
</P>
<P>
For the unenlightened, that was the opening paragraph written by Frank Keating 
in the Manchester Guardian after England's 12-9 loss to Wales in a rugby 
international at Cardiff last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Makes Grantland Rice seem kind of pale, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Is the TV Guide cover next?Before he was hospitalized with a possible kidney 
stone, the Charlotte Hornets' Kelly Tripucka explained his success this season. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no secret why I'm having a good year," he said. "I'm simply getting 
more playing time. I'm like an old TV show that played for five years, went off 
the air and is now back for reruns." 
</P>
<P>
He's not heavy, he's my rower: Even before it is rowed, Saturday's 
Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race in England has set a record of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
No, not because the 135th clash between the universities will feature two 
female coxswains for the first time. This is something much, uh, lighter than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cambridge boat will be Tony Backhouse, 19-year-old law student who will 
be the heaviest crew member in race history. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-8 and 235 pounds, Backhouse could scare the swans right off the 
Thames, to say nothing of Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they can airbrush him out: The Chicago Cubs, trying to present an image 
of power, have a poster out called "The Wrigley Bomb Squad." Seven players are 
pictured, including first baseman Mark Grace. 
</P>
<P>
One problem: In 250 at-bats at Wrigley Field last year, Grace did not hit a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
There's no comparison, Dick: After the Boston Celtics had run roughshod over 
the Indiana Pacers last week, Pacer Coach Dick Versace was left grasping for 
straws. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some bad decisions, too many lack-of-concentration things," he said. 
"You can't beat anyone playing like that, not even the University of Illinois." 
</P>
<P>
Especially not the University of Illinois. The Fighting Illini are 29-4 and in 
the NCAA's final 16. The Pacers, meanwhile, are propping up the NBA's Central 
Division at 19-46. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Although White led the American League with a .994 fielding 
percentage, he lost a close Gold Glove vote to the Seattle Mariners' Harold 
Reynolds, who made 18 errors. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: President Juan Antonio Samaranch of the International Olympic 
Committee on banned Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson: "I am sorry for the boy 
because I said many times the people that are really guilty are the people 
surrounding the athlete."

Mike Sweeney scored one goal and assisted on another Tuesday night to lead the 
Baltimore Blast to a 5-3 victory over the Los Angeles Lazers in a Major Indoor 
Soccer League game. 
</P>
<P>
Blast goalkeeper Scott Manning made nine saves and gained his league-leading 
14th victory as the first-place Blast (25-13) ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Domenic Mobilio's third-period goal was the game-winner, giving Mobilio five 
game-winning goals this season. Mobilio has scored a goal in five consecutive 
games and a point in 11 straight. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers (18-20) took a 1-0 lead on Michael Collins' 22nd goal of the season 
midway through the first period. The Blast then reeled off four unanswered 
goals to break open the game and end a three-game losing streak against the 
Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Valentine, David Byrne and Tim Wittman also scored for the Blast. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Clavijo and Gary Heale also scored for the Lazers, and goalkeeper Kris 
Peat made eight saves. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers finish their three-game trip tonight at Kansas City, Mo., against

The classics of Hermes touched knees Tuesday with the more decorative designs 
of Valentino and Emanuel Ungaro as all three fashion houses showed their fall 
styles within a 24-hour span. 
</P>
<P>
Hermes, undergoing great expansion in Europe these days, is trying to update 
its fashion image without losing its traditional charm. The results are a 
quaint blend of prim and progressive. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's famous silk twill scarf prints have been incorporated into shirts, 
sweaters and vests, which will probably become collector's items. They are 
teamed with slim leather pants, knickers and timeless tweed suits with an old 
money look. Colors for these are in the classic category, too: deep red, dark 
green, warm brown and camel. 
</P>
<P>
Some pants and coats have Kelly fastenings (named for the late 
actress-turned-princess, Grace Kelly), which have been used for decades in the 
company's luggage and bags. Updated looks include swingy fleece jackets that 
reverse from green to pale pumpkin, slate blue to gray and wine to taupe. A 
pants outfit is executed in three fabrics of the same pale sky blue shade: 
corduroy pants, slubbed wool jacket and leather coat. 
</P>
<P>
Skirts were just below the knee or longer for day and evening wear, which 
included gracefully slim black coat dresses and loose, black or white satin 
jackets to toss over skinny black satin pants. 
</P>
<P>
The new design team here consists of Claude Brouet, a French former fashion 
magazine editor; and designers Myrene de Premonville, Tan Giudicelli and Thomas 
Maier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bright and Busy 
</P>
<P>
Ungaro's look is bright and busy by comparison. It is a melange of mixed 
patterns, shiny bright satins and velvets, iridescent taffeta and tri-color 
outfits with bright shades used for jackets, blouses and skirts. In among these 
mixed messages were elegantly simple, wool tweed and black leather suits. A big 
group of the designer's signature dresses in bright colors, draped and shirred 
from shoulder to knee, received enthusiastic applause Tuesday. They looked 
positively simple amid all the other Ungaro clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The frill was definitely not gone from this designer's drawing board. His final 
group of evening wear featured short, iridescent taffeta, igloo-shaped capes 
above short, slim strapless dresses bedecked with huge rows of ruffles 
traveling every which way. 
</P>
<P>
Italian designer Valentino seemed to leave no trend untapped in his 200-outfit 
show Monday, the longest of the season so far. Long, quilted circle skirts with 
button fronts, slim skirts in above-the-knee and ankle lengths, cuffed 
trousers, tufted or quilted jackets, plaid suits and short, sexy, draped 
dresses were all on the menu here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contrasts in Color 
</P>
<P>
Colors were very bright or subdued. Hot pink or bright blue silk-quilted 
jackets appeared above slinky brown sequined dresses. Black cashmere jumpsuits 
featured filmy lace bodice inserts and lace turtlenecks. Black velvet dresses 
and theater suits were ornamented with frilly white ruffled collars and cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
The designer's signature fabric this season is a mosaic of tiny geometric 
shapes, which look sewn together by hand, as if for a quilt. This fabric, in 
brights or shades of brown, showed up in skirts, jackets and coats throughout 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The French culture minister invited visiting buyers and press on Monday night 
to the Gauguin art exhibit, which recently toured the United States and is on 
display here. On Sunday night, designer Yves Saint Laurent hosted a museum tour 
of Russian costumes lent by the Hermitage. Saint Laurent ends the week of fall 
fashion shows with his presentation today.

 DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: URBAN SPACE MESSAGE FOR SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dirk Sutro 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to urban spaces, William Whyte is our leading lab technician. His 
findings aren't mere theories. For nearly 20 years, he's been dissecting New 
York City and other dense urban areas to find out what makes them tick. In his 
new book "City: Rediscovering the Center," the summation of Whyte's knowledge 
to date is compiled in a single volume for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite tools is the hidden camera. The book is full of candid 
photos showing how people behave in cities, what they like, and what they don't 
like. Street vendors, comfortable seating, warmth and wind shielding, and 
various forms of entertainment are all essentials. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of these things seem like obvious ways of attracting and pleasing 
people, they are still often ignored. Right here in San Diego, Whyte would be 
appalled at the backwards ways of some of our downtown plazas. A noon walk 
through the heart of San Diego indicates all is not well. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s, in anticipation of the opening of the Horton Plaza shopping 
center in 1984, much hype touted the coming of the new downtown. The Hahn Co., 
the project's developer, began spending promotional dollars, and the results 
made the heart of downtown appear lively for a time. On barriers around the 
construction site were murals of prominent downtown figures, a pioneering (for 
San Diego) form of urban art. Hahn also brought live noon concerts to Horton 
Plaza Park, and mimes and other street entertainers to various locations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Desolate Place 
</P>
<P>
Horton Plaza Park today is a desolate place. Plants have died in the planters 
outside the Broadway store facing the park; one suspects they are used as 
urinals during what you might call the wee wee hours. At the heart of the 
original Horton Plaza, around the fountain designed by architect Irving Gill, 
street people sit on benches or recline on the grass. Not a single white-collar 
type dares walk through this park, even with three police officers on duty. 
</P>
<P>
What's happened is that the Hahn Co.'s promotional dollars are now spent inside 
the mall, where you'll find the pushcart vendors and entertainers. Now, the 
Horton Plaza Activities Committee, including city officials and 
</P>
<P>
downtown business types, is doing what it should have done long ago: bringing 
back some action. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to handle the problem of undesirables is to make a place 
attractive to everyone else," Whyte writes in his book. "Good places are 
largely self-policing. . . . In the 16 years that I have been studying New York 
plazas and small parks, there has been real trouble in only three, all three of 
them badly designed and managed." 
</P>
<P>
A new Arts Tix kiosk near the park will help generate a stream of office 
workers who will make their peers more comfortable in Horton Plaza Park. And, 
by mid-July, there should be live entertainment and food carts, according to 
Ted Medina of the city's Parks and Recreation Department. Asked why it took so 
long, he said the park was never intended as a place for entertainment. 
Apparently, someone is seeing the wisdom of Whyte's ways 
</P>
<P>
The plaza at the Wells Fargo Bank building at 101 W. Broadway works better than 
most; yet a significant portion of the public space at the federal building 
across the street remains a wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Out in Droves 
</P>
<P>
According to the hot dog vendor at Wells Fargo's plaza (there's also an 
espresso stand), people come out in droves as the weather warms up. Whyte is a 
proponent of public sculpture, and there is a piece here -- Charles Ross's 
"Light, Rock and Water," significant for its presence even if it isn't our 
greatest piece of art. As Whyte would wish, low walls around planters provide 
plenty of good seating. 
</P>
<P>
Bill the hot dog vendor is thinking of hiring a mime or some other 
entertainment for his customers this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Couldn't the building's management provide this under a promotional budget? 
Steve Hess of La Salle Partners manages both the Wells Fargo building and the 
Coast Savings building next to Horton Plaza, including their plazas. Coast's 
plaza has hosted events such as rallies for presidential candidate Michael 
Dukakis. Hess is considering weekly art exhibits, an excellent idea that they 
should put into action ASAP. But as for the plaza at Wells Fargo, no regular 
entertainment is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Near the federal building's main entrance, a variety of people congregate 
during the noon hour. Seating is good, and the entry provides a steady supply 
of people. But only yards away, Beverly Pepper's sculpture "Excalibur," angular 
black steel masses which seem to take off toward the sky, sits alone. It's not 
hard to see why: there's a railing around it to keep you from getting too 
close, and it's at the end of a wind tunnel-like opening in the building which 
funnels stiff gusts through the plaza.

Several blocks away, at the corner of 5th Avenue and B Street outside the First 
Interstate Bank building, the nude figures in the "Fountain of Two Oceans" 
sculpture by Sergio Benvenuti are the only people who seem to enjoy the outdoor 
plaza. At one time, there were vending carts here, and, even though there's 
nowhere to sit, a few people would congregate. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have a deli and sundry shop on the third floor, and they wanted 
protection from competition," explained Steve Hess, the building's manager. He 
said the building's tenants prefer a pristine plaza without a lot of 
hangers-on. What a contrast to walk a block east up B to the plaza at the base 
of Great American First Savings' downtown office tower. For years, the place 
has had a huge lunchtime crowd. Whyte would find much to praise here: a coffee 
pushcart, a flower shop, low walls that can be used as seats, good landscaping 
and sun exposure that keeps the place warm at the noon hour year-round. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moving Slowly 
</P>
<P>
New City Architect Mike Stepner said he accepts a major portion of the 
responsibility for the life (and death) of downtown's streets, and is well 
aware of Whyte's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, good intentions are progressing slowly. Street musicians who play 
for tips are, for the moment, illegal. On a recent weekday, only one musician 
was spotted playing a street corner during the noon hour downtown. As for 
pushing pushcarts, sidewalk cafes and better landscaping of public spaces, 
Stepner, again, is all for these things, but says there's a shortage of funds 
and/or cooperation from other city departments. 
</P>
<P>
Small efforts would make big differences downtown. The city and such downtown 
business groups as the Central City Assn. should become more aggressive in 
bringing activity to downtown's streets. Local jazz radio stations might be 
invited to help bring live music downtown. College music departments would 
probably also be interested in having an active hand in the life of their 
city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Theater groups, both professional and collegiate, might be enticed to give 
spontaneous performances downtown. And the city needs to advertise for some 
more pushcart vendors -- reduce the cost of permits for stands in public spaces 
(they now require a $500 deposit to cover processing costs), and they would 
surely attract more than the existing three pushcart-permit holders. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe then, we won't be completely embarrassed if Whyte comes for a visit.

HOFFMAN: SURVIVOR HAUNTED BY HISTORY

<P>
Lost in Translation: A Life in a New Language by Eva Hoffman (Dutton: $18.95, 
280 pages) 
</P>
<P>
I can bestow no greater praise on "Lost in Translation" -- and I can render no 
more accurate description of the book -- than to say that its author, Eva 
Hoffman, reminds me of a character who has stepped out of the pages of a story 
by Isaac Bashevis Singer and now speaks to us in her own voice. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Hoffman's voice is rich and melodic; her recollections are 
intimate, vivid, poignant; she strikes us as a marvelously passionate woman, 
fully alive and yet somehow other-worldly, a survivor who is haunted by history 
and, above all, by language. And, like Singer himself, Eva Hoffman is a 
masterful storyteller with a compelling story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman was born in Poland in the wake of the Holocaust, emigrated with her 
family to Canada in 1959, and now lives and works in the literary precincts of 
Manhattan. Her memories of childhood in Cracow in the late '40s and early '50s 
are indelible and, for the author and the reader alike, irresistible. The Hula 
Hoop craze and the death of Stalin, the joy of sampling butter and cream cheese 
in the marketplace and exploring the secret recesses of the library, thrilling 
sexual flirtations and chance encounters with primeval Jew-hatred, the first 
confrontations with the deep mysteries of sex and religion -- each experience 
has imprinted itself on Hoffman's memories of childhood, and Hoffman traces the 
intricate shape of each memory with the sure hand of a truly gifted writer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holocaust Casts Its Shadow 
</P>
<P>
"It's by adherence to the contours of a few childhood objects," Hoffman 
observes, "that the substance of our selves -- the molten force we're made of 
-- molds and shapes itself." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, for example, the Holocaust casts its shadow over Eva Hoffman, as it does 
over all children of survivors, and the memories are like the persistent ache 
from a hard tumor that has implanted itself in one's consciousness and will not 
go away: "I keep every detail of what my mother tells me in my memory like 
black beads," Hoffman comments. "I come from the war; it is my true origin." 
</P>
<P>
Once the family arrives in Vancouver, Hoffman is devastated by the sudden 
realization that she has been cut off from her cherished childhood certainties: 
"I know what it is to lose one's moorings," she recalls of a momentous 
nightmare that she characterizes as "the primal scream of my birth into the New 
World." Vancouver, she says, is where "I fell out of the net of meaning into 
the weightlessness of chaos." The cutting edge of her alienation -- and, as it 
turns out, the instrument of her redemption -- is language itself: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Essence of Riverhood 
</P>
<P>
"The words I learn now don't stand for things in the same unquestioned way they 
did in my native tongue. 'River' in Polish was a vital sound, energized with 
the essence of riverhood. . . . 'River' in English is cold -- a word without an 
aura," she explains. "This radical disjoining between word and thing is a 
desiccating alchemy, draining the world not only of significance but of its 
colors, striations, nuances -- its very existence. It is the loss of a living 
connection." 
</P>
<P>
What redeems Hoffman is the author's triumphant struggle to master the English 
language, and to thereby define herself in the vernacular of her new homeland. 
Her efforts start in the back seat of a car full of teen-agers, where she tries 
to join in the adolescent hilarity by translating a joke from the old country. 
No one laughs. "I love language too much to maul its beats," she writes of the 
painful adolescence silence that resulted from her humiliation. "Laughter is 
the lightning rod of play, the eroticism of conversation; for now, I've lost 
the ability to make the sparks fly." 
</P>
<P>
As a young woman, Hoffman studies at Rice and Harvard, where her superbly 
perceptive mind and her natural ear for language amount to a kind of manifest 
destiny -- she will not only learn the language, she will master it. ("Lost in 
Translation," of course, is the best evidence of her success -- she writes with 
ease and elegance.) In fact, Hoffman gives us the very moment of revelation -- 
she is reading T. S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" in 
preparation for a class that she teaches at the University of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Accustomed Dry Silence' 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes move over these lines in its accustomed dry silence, and then -- as if 
an aural door had opened of its own accord -- I hear their modulations and 
their quiet undertones," she writes. "I'm back within the music of the 
language, and Eliot's words descend on me with a sort of grace. Words become, 
as they were in childhood, beautiful things -- except this is better, because 
they're now crosshatched with a complexity of meaning, with the sonorities of 
felt, sensuous thought." 
</P>
<P>
"Genuine literature," according to Isaac Bashevis Singer, "manages to be both 
clear and profound. It has the magical power of merging causality with purpose, 
doubt with faith, the passions of the flesh with the yearnings of the soul. It 
is unique and general, national and universal, realistic and mystic." By even 
these lofty standards, Eva Hoffman's work in "Lost in Translation" deserves to 
be called genuine literature.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'GAME, SET': ESPIONAGE ANYONE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How utterly captivating is "Game, Set and Match," the 12-part PBS spy thriller 
premiering under the "Mystery!" banner at 9 p.m. Thursday on Channels 28 and 
15? 
</P>
<P>
This captivating. 
</P>
<P>
As you watch "Game, Set and Match," you become "Game, Set and Match." At least 
I did, popping cassette after cassette into the VCR, and after a while 
absorbing it, feeling it, thinking it, speaking it. 
</P>
<P>
"How long have I been sitting here?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
I removed my spectacles and wiped them, then put them back on and studied the 
weary face of British agent Bernard Samson on the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Six hours," said my wife. She was bent over with her arms resting on the side 
of the set, her head slumped on it. 
</P>
<P>
On the screen, Samson was at Checkpoint Charlie, waiting for the dogs to bark. 
Barking dogs were usually the first sign of something happening on the other 
side of the wall in the Eastern Sector. That's why Samson kept the car windows 
open; that's why he was frozen nearly to death. 
</P>
<P>
Six hours! Had it been that long since I began watching this Granada Television 
version of Len Deighton's 1980s trilogy, "Berlin Game," "Mexico Set" and 
"London Match"? Seven hours remained. I wished it were longer. It had all 
passed so quickly. Everything had passed so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"The actor you're watching wasn't a star, the spy thriller you're watching 
hadn't been written, and we thought you'd last only a few days when you first 
started reviewing television," my wife said. "We were stupid kids, but it was 
better then, wasn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Like Samson, I revealed no emotion. "It's always better when you're young, 
Fiona," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fiona is Samson's wife; I'm Carol," my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
On the screen, Samson wiped a spyhole of clear glass in the windshield so that 
he could see into the glare of fluorescent lighting as he sat in his car, a 
tape recorder wired into the battery and a mike taped behind the sun visor and 
a borrowed revolver making an uncomfortable bulge under his arm. 
</P>
<P>
I heard barking dogs. They were my neighbor's. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that captivating. 
</P>
<P>
From KGB super mole Kim Philby on down, actual British spy cases have whet our 
appetites for stories about secret agents on both the fast-food and gourmet 
levels. "Game, Set and Match" is the latter, earning a hallowed place just 
below those other great-and-gloomy espionage epics from British television, 
"Reilly: Ace of Spies" and the John le Carre stories "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, 
Spy" and "Smiley's People." 
</P>
<P>
Le Carre's "A Perfect Spy" last fall was a miniseries to behold as well, but 
had less to do with the act than with the mentality of spying, in contrast with 
a classic espionage tale like "Game, Set and Match." 
</P>
<P>
Suspenseful. Baffling. Twisty. Elegantly murky. Grandly bleak. Wonderfully 
mounted and acted. All of these apply to "Game, Set and Match." Be prepared for 
your heart to break, your spine to tingle. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour premiere is followed by weekly hourlong episodes, all threaded by 
the presence of the shrewd and capable, but unheroic Samson (Ian Holm). "All I 
want is to put my feet up at home and never be frightened," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He does neither for long. 
</P>
<P>
A former top agent in Berlin who created a high-grade spy network in the East, 
Samson is now a field man beset by desk men, bureaucratic fools who are as 
interested in protecting their personal fiefdoms as in insulating the British 
secret service from the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Flashback: After a mission in Poland goes sour, Samson is given a sedentary 
desk job at London Central, where his skills atrophy and he is ultimately 
outranked by his cool, efficient wife, Fiona, who runs the espionage agency's 
data processing center known as the Yellow Submarine. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's five years later. Burned out and feeling dead inside, Samson is 
ordered back into East Berlin to plug a security leak and learn the identity of 
a KGB mole in London Central. Wearily and reluctantly, he complies. 
</P>
<P>
This is Deighton's typically gray, overcast, unglamorous milieu, where there 
are no superheroes, only characters who are flawed, vulnerable and and not 
necessarily noble. In novel after novel, Deighton peels back layers of 
deception, betrayal and ambiguity to expose the cold pragmatism of espionage. 
On both sides of the wall, this is a pretty crummy bunch. 
</P>
<P>
With John Howlett providing the script and Ken Grieve and Patrick Lau the 
direction, all of Deighton's finely honed staples work against panoramic 
international locales. If you're an Anglophile or love complex spy stories, 
this is for you. 
</P>
<P>
There are double agents, an apparent defector and class strata within the spy 
class, as Samson himself is ultimately suspected as a traitor and his children 
become pawns in the East-West struggle. To say any more would spoil the fun. 
</P>
<P>
The casting of Holm as Samson was unlikely, but inspired. That he's a head 
shorter and 15 years older than Samson is supposed to be makes him all the more 
intriguing as the pivotal character in a spy story. It's a beautifully muted 
performance of economy and irony, coming largely in the silences that are 
Samson's main currency of communication. 
</P>
<P>
Harassed by superiors who question even his expense accounts and by a cruel 
father-in-law who wants to control his children, Samson is someone you pull for 
precisely because he is so battered and wounded. His shoulders sag with 
resignation and his eyes are the empty eyes of a man who, literally and 
figuratively, has crossed over the wall too many times. 
</P>
<P>
Backing Holm are the usual impeccable supporting actors who populate the best 
of British drama. Most notably there are Mel Martin as Fiona; Michael Degen as 
Samson's resourceful German friend, Werner; Brigitte Karner as Werner's 
scheming wife; Anthony Bate as the Anglicized American spy chief Bret 
Rensselaer; Michael Culver as Samson's comically trendy superior, Dicky Cruyer; 
Frederick Treves as Berlin Station head Frank Harrington and John Gottfried as 
KGB Major Erich Stinnes, arguably the story's most fascinating character next 
to Samson. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, also, there is the big performance in a tiny role that bowls you 
over, such as Eva Ebner as Samson's old friend in Berlin, the red-headed Lisl 
Hennig. 
</P>
<P>
There are instances where "Game, Set and Match" confuses or meanders. The story 
noticeably drops off in focus, pace and and suspense when the setting initially 
shifts to Mexico, for example. There are times, also, when Samson and his 
colleagues seem too loose-tongued in public and when relationships aren't 
entirely in sync. And, far down the line, the story's rousing climax raises 
more questions than it answers. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all times, however, this is exciting, irresistible television, an 
enthralling study of a man on the edge who is struggling with life, his job and 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"You are quiet like a grave," Lisl tells Samson. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a grave," he replies.

Glasnost Comrades: A reporter and camera operator from an Atlanta television 
station are involved in an unusual job-swapping deal in which they'll spend six 
weeks in the Soviet Union, and then a Soviet reporter will spend six weeks at 
their station. WXIA-TV reporter Simeon Smith, who is fluent in Russian, and 
cameraman Richard Crabbe left Tuesday for Tbilisi, Atlanta's sister city in the 
Soviet Republic of Georgia. There they will work for Gostelradio, the 
government organization that runs Soviet television. Smith said most of his 
work in Tbilisi will be relatively apolitical, "but if they have a hot story, 
like an earthquake, I'm part of the team." When they return, they'll be 
accompanied by Nugzar Ruhadze, an English-speaking Soviet newsman who will 
report to Atlanta viewers. ALEENE MacMINN

Budget woes continue to plague the Denver Symphony orchestra. The orchestra, 
whose current season was almost wiped out by red ink, now must end the season 
this Saturday, three months early, because of a nearly $1-million shortfall. 
"Obviously, we cannot continue to run without cash in the bank, and at this 
point in time we can't run until June," chairman John Low said. He said the 
orchestra, which is canceling eight concerts, will be back next season. Low 
blamed the financial problems on lack of public confidence in the orchestra's 
management, which for years has allowed the symphony to run in the red. "Donors 
-- substantial donors -- do not like to support an organization that does not 
balance its budget," he said. The orchestra had canceled the current season but 
a last-ditch fund-raising drive last fall allowed it to open, two weeks late. 
Musicians, who will be paid through the end of the week only, were surprised by 
the latest announcement. "Nobody in the orchestra knew we were going down the 
tube at this moment," said David Abosch, principal oboist, who joined the 
symphony in 1949. "We were told that once we got through late February and 
early March, we would be all right." Violinist Lee Yeingst said the musicians 
were hoping that the board of trustees "will still be beating the bushes, 
trying to find money." ALEENE MacMINN

Saying that "a school like this would have made my life easier," actor Henry 
Winkler on Tuesday joined Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich at a 
news conference detailing a new recruitment drive for the Los Angeles County 
High School for the Arts. The school, founded in 1985 and located on the Cal 
State Los Angeles campus, is the only high school of its kind in the county. It 
offers an academic and arts curriculum in which students major in theater, 
music, visual arts or dance. Applicants must have a 2.0 grade average, need 
recommendations from teachers and also must pass an audition. "We take students 
with training as well as those with just raw talent," said vice principal 
D'liese Melendrez. Applications will be accepted from 10th- and 11th-graders 
until April 15. ALEENE MacMINN

POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION: MORE THAN THE BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It makes the headlines periodically: A mother kills her child -- or children. 
We pity the children, the family and friends; we recoil from the horror of it. 
The last thing that many of us are able to feel is understanding and compassion 
for the disturbed mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Postpartum: Beyond the Blues," a Lifetime cable documentary showing at 9 p.m. 
tonight, tries hard to give us that understanding. Its sympathetic narrator, 
Susan Sarandon -- pregnant herself at the time of the filming -- guides viewers 
through a tragic chronicle of lives lost or everlastingly affected by 
infanticide or suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The primary focus is Nancy Berchtold, who was diagnosed with postpartum 
psychosis following the birth of her daughter. Berchtold received effective 
help; her daughter, now 5 years old, was never harmed, even though one of 
Berchtold's delusions was that she had suffocated her. 
</P>
<P>
Her experience led her to form a support group for new mothers called 
"Depression After Delivery" and to fight to free one woman who was sentenced to 
prison after killing her baby son. We're haunted by the face of that woman's 
8-year-old daughter, who was 5 when her mother went to prison. We meet another 
woman who killed her two young sons; we meet her grieving, yet supportive 
husband and family. 
</P>
<P>
The message is that these tragedies could have been prevented if society would 
recognize that the problem is "not moral, but physical." We're told that, 
unlike the United States, Great Britain treats the disease as a matter of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to mourn for the slain children we see smiling in old photographs; it 
remains a struggle to grieve for the tormented women, surrounded by phantoms 
and alien even to their own intimates. But Berchtold's testimony and the 
eloquence of husbands and family members here helps bring understanding closer.

DECISIONS MAY SPUR EXPANDED DRUG TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday's Supreme Court decisions on drug testing will encourage California 
employers to expand their testing programs, particularly to determine whether 
drugs played a role in causing an accident, a lawyer who has represented many 
California companies in drug-testing litigation believes. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the decisions may encourage private-sector employers to expand 
their pre-employment testing programs, even though neither of the two decisions 
dealt directly with that issue, said Victor Schachter, a San Francisco lawyer 
who wrote a friend-of-the-court brief in one of the cases on behalf of the 
California Employment Law Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strong Message' 
</P>
<P>
The decisions "send a very strong message" that the Supreme Court believes 
safety issues are going to be weighed "very heavily" when employees or their 
unions raise objections on grounds that their privacy rights have been 
violated, Schachter said. 
</P>
<P>
But other lawyers who have represented employees in drug-testing litigation say 
that the decisions are very narrowly drawn and are unlikely to have much effect 
on workers whose jobs do not involve public safety or security issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the decisions have as wide a ramification as one might initially 
think," said Ed Chen, staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Both cases involve very limited types of testing under extraordinary 
circumstances -- in one testing rail crews after accidents and the other 
involving customs employees in law enforcement. In each case, the court said 
there was a compelling government interest to justify the invasion of privacy," 
Chen added. 
</P>
<P>
Employees in non-sensitive jobs in California, such as court clerks, have 
nothing to fear from the opinion, said Glen Rothner, a Los Angeles labor lawyer 
who represents unions. However, he added, "If you're a police officer who 
carries a firearm, it's going to be a difficult battle" to resist drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
The effect on some occupations -- such as firefighters and truck drivers 
hauling loads of toxics -- is not immediately clear, Rothner said. "The 
decisions Tuesday placed considerable emphasis on the unique work environments 
and job missions" of railway employees and customs agents dealing with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constitutions Differ 
</P>
<P>
Rothner also said that the decisions by no means resolve all drug-testing 
issues for Californians because the U.S. Constitution does not have a specific 
privacy provision, as the California Constitution does. "It's still possible 
for the California Supreme Court" to limit drug testing more broadly in some 
circumstances than the U.S. Supreme Court did Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Jay Roth, who also represents unions in drug-testing cases, 
said he is concerned that the decisions might encourage companies who do 
business with the federal government to instigate random testing programs in an 
attempt to comply with new federal regulations calling on government 
contractors to maintain a "drug-free" workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Kirby, director of employee relations for the California Trucking Assn., 
said that he thinks the decision might have a significant effect on a case 
already pending in California. Some employees of large trucking companies and 
owner-operators have challenged various aspects of regulations promulgated by 
the U.S. Department of Transportation last year. In January, U.S. District 
Judge Marilyn H. Patel in San Francisco enjoined parts of the program, 
including all random testing and some post-accident testing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Likely to Be Upheld 
</P>
<P>
Kirby said that Tuesday's ruling upholding testing of all employees involved in 
a rail accident, regardless of whether there is individual suspicion of drug 
use, makes it likely that the Transportation Department's post-accident testing 
regulations ultimately will be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
"Like Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, we are heartened by the decisions," said 
Cmdr. William Booth, chief spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. He 
said that the rulings will have no immediate effect on the LAPD's testing 
program but that he hopes it is a sign that the high court ultimately will 
approve random testing for "those who by the very nature of their jobs hold the 
lives of others in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transit District, which has had a drug-testing policy in 
effect since the early 1980s, has no plans to change, spokeswoman Claudia Keith 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have pre-employment drug testing and that's for all (potential) employees," 
Keith said, adding that drivers may be subject to drug testing when they have 
been involved in an accident on duty. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, if a supervisor feels the circumstances of the accident 
warrants it or if there's any type of injury, the employee will be drug 
tested." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do any type of random drug testing at all," she said. Keith added 
that an employee may also be drug tested if a supervisor believes that the 
person is under the influence, but she said it is "very rare that it happens at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact on Pilots 
</P>
<P>
John Mazur, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn., said that he thinks the 
decision will not have a major impact in California or nationally on the 41,000 
pilots flying for the major carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never said that testing after an airline accident was not 
appropriate," Mazur said. "That's one of four circumstances where we see a 
legitimate use of drug testing." 
</P>
<P>
Two major cases on drug testing are pending before California appeals courts. 
One involves the challenge of two Stanford athletes to a drug-testing program 
imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The other involves a challenge to a pre-employment testing program by Matthew 
Bender &amp; Co., a legal publishing firm that is a subsidiary of Times Mirror 
Co. That program has been challenged by three prospective employees and the 
American Civil Liberties Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, in its first ruling on the constitutionality of drug 
testing, Tuesday gave the government broad power to test employees who are 
entrusted with public safety or sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
In two cases, the high court directly upheld federally mandated urine testing 
of railway workers and Customs Service employees, and its opinions appear to 
permit screening of police officers, firefighters, air traffic controllers, bus 
drivers, nuclear plant workers and even some white-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's compelling interests in preventing the promotion of drug 
users to positions where they might endanger the integrity of our nation's 
borders or the life of the citizenry outweigh the privacy interests" of 
individual employees, wrote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's newest 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials immediately hailed the long-anticipated decisions 
as a landmark in the government's war against drugs. Many drug testing programs 
have been on hold while the legal challenges were pending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Heartening' 
</P>
<P>
The rulings are "a significant first step in validating what had proved to be a 
useful program" in eradicating drugs in the workplace, Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh said at a press conference. It is a "heartening result for those 
interested in furthering the battle against drug abuse in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
However, civil liberties advocates and labor union leaders decried what they 
called the most significant court blow to citizens' privacy rights in years. 
</P>
<P>
"The court has sacrificed the rights and liberties of Customs Service employees 
in our country's nebulous fight against illegal drugs," said Robert Tobias, 
president of a union representing Customs Service workers. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Chen, staff counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union in Northern 
California, said: "We're disappointed in the decisions. They permit testing 
without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. We feel that a basic Fourth 
Amendment principle has been dispensed with here." 
</P>
<P>
And, said Peter Arenella, professor of constitutional law at UCLA: "The customs 
case is far more significant than the railway case. Its significance lies in 
the fact that the court is willing to justify, and find reasonable, an invasion 
of privacy rights on the basis of a generalized concern to promote public 
confidence in government employees who are in sensitive drug-interdicting 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again," he added, "the Supreme Court has balanced citizens' individual 
rights against society's need for efficient and effective crime control, and 
once again the balance tips in favor of the government." 
</P>
<P>
The rulings have no direct impact on companies or employees in the private 
sector, because the constitutional provision at issue in the cases -- the 
Fourth Amendment -- only forbids "unreasonable searches and seizures" by 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Screening Seen 
</P>
<P>
But federal and union officials said that they expect the court action to spur 
a new surge in drug screening programs in government agencies and industry 
nationwide. A number of police forces, transit agencies and other public 
entities have proposed instituting drug tests for at least some of their 
workers and job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
While the court opinions clear up doubts about many drug testing programs 
commonly imposed in recent years, they do not answer all the questions. The 
opinions say nothing about random testing of workers. 
</P>
<P>
In the two cases before the court, the railroad workers were tested only after 
a train accident, while Customs Service employees were tested if they sought 
promotions to jobs that involved seizing drugs or carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Bush Administration is seeking to require 350,000 federal 
workers in sensitive jobs to submit to random tests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Language 
</P>
<P>
But in its strong language upholding the legal justification for screening, the 
court suggested less concern about the method of screening than about the 
nature of jobs for which it would be used. 
</P>
<P>
The railway workers operate potentially "lethal" equipment, while the Customs 
Service workers are "our nation's first line of defense" in the war on drugs, 
Kennedy wrote. Such employees "reasonably should expect effective inquiry into 
their fitness and probity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawyers said that they expect the high court to clarify which jobs and 
circumstances do not warrant drug testing as it rules on other screening 
programs on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the great majority of federal workers will be spared the indignity 
of urine testing according to the court's decision," said Tobias, president of 
the National Treasury Employees Unions, which filed the legal challenge against 
the customs' testing program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Car Accidents 
</P>
<P>
But other union lawyers said that the court appears ready to allow much wider 
testing. "What's to prevent the government from requiring that everyone who is 
involved in an auto accident or is injured on the job be tested for drugs?" 
asked Washington attorney Lawrence Mann, who represented the railway workers. 
"That's about the same situation we had with the railroad workers." 
</P>
<P>
The high court upheld the testing of railway workers on a 7-2 vote and the 
customs employees by a 5-4 margin. 
</P>
<P>
The railway decision (Skinner, Transportation Secretary, vs. Railway Labor 
Executives, 87-1555) overturned a 2-1 ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco last year that declared that drug and alcohol testing 
of rail workers after accidents was unconstitutional, except when supervisors 
had some "individual suspicion" that an employee was impaired. 
</P>
<P>
The screening had been imposed by the Federal Railroad Administration in 1985 
in response to a rash of accidents blamed on drunkenness. Two years later, 16 
Amtrak passengers were killed near Baltimore when a Conrail engineer ran his 
locomotive through a stop signal and onto the tracks in front of the speeding 
train. A post-accident test found that the Conrail engineer and his brakeman 
were under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marshall Dissents 
</P>
<P>
In a dissent to the high court's majority opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall, 
joined by William J. Brennan Jr., denounced the use of "dragnet blood and urine 
testing" and said that he feared the "first and worst casualty of the war on 
drugs will be the precious liberties of our citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"Precisely because the need for action against the drug scourge is manifest, 
the need for vigilance against unconstitutional excess is great," Marshall 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The second case, involving the Customs Service workers, proved more difficult 
for the court because there was no evidence of a drug problem in the agency. 
U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab, when he initiated a urine testing 
requirement in May, 1986, said that he believed his employees were "largely 
drug-free." During the first five months of testing, 3,663 employees were 
tested for drugs and only five registered positive, the court was told. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bribery, Blackmail 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the court approved the program. "The almost unique mission of the 
(Customs) service" to curb the smuggling of drugs into the country "gives the 
government a compelling interest in ensuring that many of these employees do 
not use drugs even off-duty, for such use creates risks of bribery and 
blackmail," Kennedy said in the case (NTEU vs. Von Raab, 86-1879). 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative appointee of former President Ronald 
Reagan, strongly dissented, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Marshall and 
Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized the majority for accepting the government's "feeble 
justifications" for the Customs Service testing program without evidence of 
"even a single instance" of drug abuse in the agency. Von Raab's testing 
program was simply "an exercise in symbolism," Scalia said. By upholding it, 
"the court exposes vast numbers of public employees to this needless 
indignity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington and Henry Weinstein in Los Angeles 
contributed to this story.

<P>
DRUG TESTING IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's Supreme Court decision, approximately 50,000 federal 
employees were subject to random drug tests. That number now is expected to 
increase to 350,000. Tests may be authorized by federal agencies for employees 
in "critical and sensitive" positions, according to a 1986 executive order.

OLD HOLLYWOOD LOTS DISAPPEARING; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATIONISTS HOPE TO REWRITE ENDING AT STUDIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When word got out that a Hollywood studio where Harold Lloyd, Lucille Ball and 
Francis Ford Coppola once plied their talents had been nominated as a 
historic-cultural monument, the entertainment industry saw it as an ominous 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly it seemed as though old concrete barns and other nondescript 
structures still being used for creating movies, television shows and 
commercials could be frozen in time, even if experts agreed that they had no 
architectural distinction. 
</P>
<P>
For Hollywood Center Studios, the nomination posed an infuriating dilemma. The 
owners wanted to replace some seismically unsafe buildings made of hollow clay 
tile that were hastily and cheaply erected in the 1920s. But they could be 
prevented from doing so if the studio became a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
What might have been a commonplace skirmish between a property owner and a 
neighborhood organization has turned into a far more significant conflict 
between the studios and historic preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say the future character of Hollywood itself could well be at stake, 
even though only one other studio has been directly involved so far. Paramount 
owns the Western Costume Co. building directly to its east on Melrose Avenue 
and may want to tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, no one has yet attempted to inventory remaining historic film 
studios, and until recently they received scant attention even from local 
preservation groups. The city of Los Angeles has conferred cultural-historical 
monument status 418 times since 1962, yet such designation has rarely been 
sought for a movie studio. 
</P>
<P>
But now officials of two preservation groups, Hollywood Heritage Inc. and the 
Los Angeles Conservancy, want to retain the flavor of the movies' Golden Age by 
trying to prevent further destruction of the remaining barns and bungalows that 
give Los Angeles, especially Hollywood, a unique look. 
</P>
<P>
The studio owners, citing recent renovation efforts at lots like Paramount's, 
say that they also want to maintain continuity with the past. But they contend 
that Hollywood is really preserved on celluloid and videotape, not in old 
edifices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Flexibility Asked 
</P>
<P>
What is needed, the studios say, is more flexibility, not less, to accommodate 
the ever-changing technological demands of their high-pressure industry. 
Otherwise, they say, exasperated film makers will be more tempted than ever to 
take their productions elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine if the Ford Motor Co. was told it had to keep the building where the 
Model T was produced," said Thomas McGovern, vice president of Raleigh Studios 
on Melrose Avenue. "How would they put out the Ford Taurus or the Probe?" 
</P>
<P>
To preservationists like Hillary Gitelman, executive director of Hollywood 
Heritage, a nonprofit organization with about 300 members, the studios have a 
significance that extends beyond the business enterprises that occupy them -- 
associations and memories worth preserving for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the industrial sites around which Hollywood grew and developed," she 
said. ". . . They're really important to the world in terms of the myths that 
were created here and the cultural impact of those creations." 
</P>
<P>
Only one year after the Model T Ford was introduced in 1908, Los Angeles' first 
movie studio was established on the site of a vacant downtown Chinese laundry. 
By 1915 there were 60 film studios in the area, according to historian Marc 
Wanamaker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recognized Landmarks 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 17 facilities dating from 1940 or earlier remain. Yet KTLA-TV, the 
neo-Colonial building on Sunset Boulevard where "The Jazz Singer" was made in 
1927, and KCET-TV, the oldest continually used studio in the country, are the 
only active studios officially recognized as landmarks. Spanish-style brick 
structures from the '20s still stand on KCET's lot, also on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Preservation has not exactly been a watchword of the film industry. No one 
stopped 20th Century Fox 30 years ago when it began dismantling its back lot to 
make way for Century City or interfered with Universal Studios when, a few 
years later, it started replacing historic buildings with office towers. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, the owners of Culver Studios on West Washington Boulevard 
in Culver City demolished two glass-enclosed sound stages from the silent 
screen era after first trying to find a new home for them. "I couldn't give 
them away," said Bob Sirchia, vice president for operations. "There was zero 
interest in them." 
</P>
<P>
It was only when Hollywood Center Studios protested its nomination as a 
monument that Hollywood Heritage began to recognize the value of the old 
studios. "It had never come up before," Gitelman said, noting that it usually 
takes a threatened demolition to mobilize preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
Of the cities where historic studios are located, only Los Angeles currently 
has an ordinance that can specifically be used for their preservation, although 
West Hollywood is expected to follow shortly. Hearings are being held on a 
proposed ordinance that could affect the future of Warners Hollywood Studios on 
Sunset Boulevard, which dates back to 1918. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Culver City Situation 
</P>
<P>
No such ordinance exists in Culver City, home of Lorimar (formerly the site of 
MGM-UA) and Culver Studios, where David O. Selznick made "A Star Is Born" and 
much of "Gone With the Wind." Lorimar has the last remaining glass-enclosed 
sound stage and uses it to make sets. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the roster of monuments includes two former studios, the 
Tudor-style Charlie Chaplin facilities on La Brea Avenue (now the home of 
A&amp;M Records) and Mack Sennett's on Glendale Boulevard in Echo Park (now 
owned by a storage company). But in 1981, the city's Cultural Heritage 
Commission rejected monument status for an abandoned studio on Santa Monica 
Boulevard and Van Ness Street, where Mickey Rooney got his first major role. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, perhaps, the preservation controversy erupted only a few years 
after the studios themselves decided that sprucing up their lots, even at 
considerable cost, was good for business. Many lots had been neglected, 
especially during the 1960s and early '70s, when the movie industry was in a 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
So little thought was given to design back then that at Paramount, for example, 
a dressing room building from the 1920s was expanded in piecemeal fashion 
whenever a star demanded more space. Interior detailing everywhere was stripped 
for a more streamlined effect, according to Ann Mullaney, executive director of 
design development. 
</P>
<P>
Former Paramount executives were so oblivious to their surroundings that it 
took 16 years after the studio bought the adjoining Desilu lot in 1967 for the 
defunct television studio's logo to be removed from the water tower. 
</P>
<P>
But once the decades of indifference ended and more picturesque surroundings 
became available, producers began lining up to secure offices on these lots and 
soak up the ambiance, according to studio managers. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last six years, major renovation has occurred at three historic 
Hollywood studios, including the two that are now the focus of 
preservationists' attention and Raleigh Studios, a rental lot where "The Girl 
From Yesterday," starring Mary Pickford, was made in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, the last major film studio still located in Hollywood, won an award 
last year from the Los Angeles Conservancy for its preservation efforts. 
Architects have worked from original blueprints to painstakingly restore the 
original buildings, and grass was planted over parking lots to re-create the 
park-like setting of 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Since Paramount purchased Western Costume Co. last year, it has been widely 
assumed that the studio would replace the 76-year-old building. This 
speculation intensified after the historic collection itself was sold earlier 
this month to three investors, including novelist Sidney Sheldon. Although 
Paramount's Mullaney said the Western Costume building does not appear suitable 
for conversion to offices, studio officials say they have not yet decided what 
to do with it. They are clearly nervous that preservationists might seek to 
have the building declared a cultural-historical monument. 
</P>
<P>
As with Western Costume, it is Hollywood Center Studio's role in the 
development of the film industry, not its architecture, that has drawn the 
preservationists' attention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprise for New Owners 
</P>
<P>
Not long after Francis Ford Coppola went bankrupt and was forced to sell his 
Zoetrope Studios in 1984, the new owners of the renamed Hollywood Center 
Studios discovered that a private citizen had nominated their lot on Las Palmas 
Avenue as a monument. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Los Angeles law, such status can be conferred not only on buildings 
with architectural significance but also on "historic structures or sites in 
which the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, 
state or community is reflected or exemplified. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
If the owner objects to the designation, demolition or substantial alteration 
can be delayed for 360 days while a buyer is sought. But the Cultural Heritage 
Commission cannot dictate how a site is to be used or force private enterprises 
such as studios to open their doors to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ordinance theoretically controls only major structural changes, 
the studios say that once a building is flagged as a landmark, every proposed 
alteration is subject to frustrating delays and red tape. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, had Paramount Studios been a monument, said Christine Essel, vice 
president for planning and development, it would have been impossible to secure 
the permits necessary to get Stage 29 ready in six weeks for live broadcasts of 
"The Arsenio Hall Show," as the producers demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Once headquarters to silent screen comedian Harold Lloyd, Hollywood Center 
Studios, which first opened in 1919, was also the site where Howard Hughes 
produced and directed "Hell's Angels," giving Jean Harlow her first starring 
role. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, "I Love Lucy," "The Ozzie and Harriet Show" and "The Burns and 
Allen Show" were made there. George Burns still maintains an office there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shocking Realization 
</P>
<P>
It was not until Hollywood Center Studios was denied a permit to demolish some 
two-story gray buildings, which the city itself had pronounced seismically 
unsafe, that the new management realized the significance of the 
cultural-historical nomination, according to Albert J. Tenzer, vice president 
and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged, Tenzer invited Thomas Hines, a UCLA professor of architecture and 
urban planning, to inspect the buildings. Hines saw no harm in tearing them 
down, although he urged that a bas relief be saved. 
</P>
<P>
"They (preservationists) deal in what I would call the 'Indian burial ground 
syndrome,' " Tenzer said. "You can't touch anything because the ghosts that 
surround and permeate the hallowed grounds are not to be disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
The impasse at Hollywood Center Studios, now a rental lot, led City Councilman 
Michael Woo to create a task force to try to resolve the dispute between 
studios and preservationists, perhaps by developing new legislation 
specifically tailored to the studios' needs. 
</P>
<P>
Optimistic about the prospects for resolution, Woo said, "The preservationists 
are showing themselves not to be purists, in terms of being absolutist about 
their positions." 
</P>
<P>
Woo fashioned a special compromise for Hollywood Center Studios that will give 
the facility partial designation, thereby allowing the unsafe buildings to be 
torn down. The agreement also allows interiors changes to be made without 
interference from the Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning Unit Formed 
</P>
<P>
The studios, which recently formed a Studio Planning Council to address 
preservation and other government-related issues, say more flexibility is 
needed if producers are to be kept from abandoning Hollywood for other states 
that are eagerly trying to lure their business. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't freeze something and keep it economic," said Robert Bertram Burke, a 
lawyer who has represented Paramount and Hollywood Center Studios. "It's like 
shooting somebody and formaldehyding them so you can keep them looking like 
they did when they were 30." 
</P>
<P>
Yet although California loses about $3 billion as a result of "runaway 
production," there are signs that the state is beginning to recapture some of 
the production work it has lost over the last few years. Last year, 55% of all 
feature films were shot in California, a 2% increase over the previous year, 
according to Michael Walbrecht, spokesman for the California Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preservationists say, it is important to consider the future, when 
maintaining old buildings sitting on valuable real estate may not be as 
fashionable. "We want to protect these resources for our children," Gitelman 
said.

'VIRUS-LIKE AGENT' MAY BE NEW CLUE TO CAUSE OF AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mysterious "virus-like agent" detected in AIDS patients has been described in 
detail by a team of federal researchers, who suggest that their findings may 
challenge prevailing wisdom on what causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers, at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the National 
Institutes of Health, said the agent may represent a new infection striking 
people with damaged immune systems, or may play "a more fundamental role as a 
co-factor" in triggering AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Our . . . data is too meager to make this distinction, but we have 
unequivocally demonstrated the existence of a previously unrecognized 
virus-like infectious agent in patients with AIDS," they reported in the most 
recent issue of the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
Virologists and other AIDS researchers reacted with caution to the findings, a 
follow-up to a brief, preliminary account by the researchers in 1986. 
Scientists on Tuesday described the more detailed results as provocative but 
not necessarily conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the findings have yet to be confirmed by other 
researchers -- a crucial test of the credibility of a piece of research. Some 
also cited what they described as limitations in the federal researchers' 
methods and data. 
</P>
<P>
All said they were withholding judgment on the significance of the report. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very interesting, I think it deserves more attention," said 
Norbert Rapoza, a virologist and senior scientist with the American Medical 
Assn. who has followed the research. "I think it has to be looked at more 
closely." 
</P>
<P>
Most leading researchers believe that AIDS is caused by the human 
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. The virus is thought to gradually destroy a 
person's immune system, leaving the person vulnerable to a range of infections 
that are eventually lethal. 
</P>
<P>
Some AIDS activists and a few scientists challenge that explanation, contending 
that AIDS may result from a combination of forces or another virus. AIDS 
activists who hold that view welcomed the newly published report on Tuesday, 
saying that it supports their suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
The federal researchers, headed by Shyh-Ching Lo of the Armed Forces Institute, 
originally identified the new virus-like infectious agent, called VLIA, in a 
single patient with Kaposi's sarcoma, a form of cancer that affects some AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Using a series of sophisticated laboratory techniques, the scientists 
determined that the agent could infect cells. Through analysis, they also 
concluded that it was distinct from numerous other viruses, some of which have 
also been suspected of being co-factors in causing AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
They then examined DNA isolated from various organs in 10 people with AIDS; in 
seven, they found pieces of DNA apparently similar to that of the virus-like 
agent. When they examined DNA from people without AIDS, they found no such 
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our findings suggest that VLIA may represent a new opportunistic infection in 
these severely (debilitated) patients, or an agent which plays a more 
fundamental role as a co-factor in the process associated with infection by 
HIV," the researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
Through intermediaries, Lo declined Tuesday to discuss his findings. 
</P>
<P>
The journal in which the report appeared this month is published by the 
American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Virologists described the 
journal, mailed monthly to 3,600 specialists, as a respected forum for issues 
concerning tropical medicine. 
</P>
<P>
All reports must be reviewed and approved in advance by experts in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Virologists contacted Tuesday declined to speculate on the significance of Lo's 
findings. Some also declined to be quoted by name on the subject. They said the 
viral agent could prove to be anything from a contributing cause of AIDS to 
nothing more than a contaminant. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that the agent does exist," said Rapoza, who said he has 
followed Lo's work for 18 months. "I don't think he's faking it. He has 
something; he has a virus. The question is, where did it come from?" 
</P>
<P>
Another prominent virologist said "it would be nice" to see additional evidence 
-- for example, confirmation by other researchers, a good electron microscopic 
picture of the agent and more proof that the agent is common in AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in separate work, U.S. scientists announced Tuesday that they have 
successfully modified the AIDS drug AZT in the hope of making it more potent in 
counteracting HIV and reducing its side-effects, such as anemia and bone marrow 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sudhir Gogu of Tulane University School of Medicine announced the 
development of so-called DP-AZT at a meeting of the Federation of American 
Societies for Experimental Biology in New Orleans. He reported "promising 
results" in mice cells. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, also known as retrovir or zidovudine, is the only approved treatment for 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome on the U.S. market. Although not a cure, 
the drug can prolong the lives of AIDS victims by slowing the spread of 
infection from cell to cell.

STATE TAX BOARD IS ACCUSED OF DODGING BAD ADVICE PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In the final days of the 1988 legislative session, lawmakers approved a measure 
that would severely penalize the state for giving individuals faulty written 
advice on income tax questions. 
</P>
<P>
Now the authors of the legislation claim the Franchise Tax Board is attempting 
to circumvent provisions in the law that require them to waive additional 
taxes, penalties and interest when the state's written advice is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The law was pushed through the Legislature by Assemblyman Elihu Harris 
(D-Oakland) and Board of Equalization Member Conway Collis as part of a 
Taxpayer Bill of Rights designed to make it easier for individuals to grapple 
with the state's complex tax system. 
</P>
<P>
While both federal and state law had previously provided protections against 
penalties and interest when written advice was given in error, never before 
have taxpayers been granted an exemption from additional income taxes if the 
advice was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The provision could virtually wipe out a taxpayers' liability in the event of a 
major error on the part of the state. For lawmakers, it seemed particularly 
apropos at a time when the federal government's Internal Revenue Service was 
being constantly criticized for giving wrong answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to create a situation in which average taxpayers could rely on advice 
given to them by their state government," Collis said Tuesday. "Income tax is 
an area that is really scary to most taxpayers and I wanted them to be able to 
write in and say 'I'm confused.' " 
</P>
<P>
But when the law became effective in January, Collis said, the staff of the 
Franchise Tax Board made no attempt to advise taxpayers of their new rights. 
And guidelines drafted to implement the law, he said, were fashioned so that it 
would be difficult for average taxpayers to avail themselves of the guarantees 
against additional taxes, penalties and interest if the written advice from the 
board was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't going to work if the board keeps it a secret," said Collis. "The 
whole idea is to make the state tax system a little easier to deal with for 
people. It's bad enough that we have to pay taxes. We ought not to put people 
through the wringer to figure out what they're supposed to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Collis said his complaints have since produced suggestions from the board's 
staff for "major" revisions to the guidelines. Collis and Harris are scheduled 
to air their complaints directly to the board at a March 23 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The present guidelines, patterned after the Internal Revenue Service system, 
establishes several categories of written advice. The only category that 
provides protection from additional taxes -- called a chief counsel ruling -- 
requires the taxpayer to present a written explanation and analysis of his tax 
question. The category routinely used to answer taxpayer questions, called an 
information letter, provides no protections. 
</P>
<P>
Collis, who argues that the law was meant to apply to all forms of written 
advice, said few taxpayers would ever know to ask for a specific category of 
reply when they seek written advice. 
</P>
<P>
In drafting the guidelines, Franchise Tax Board officials said they had taken 
pains to ensure that protections against additional taxes only be extended when 
the written advice was given by experienced lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's assume a brand new employee in the department who has only a few weeks' 
experience makes an error in judgment and provides the wrong data," said Jim 
Reber, a spokesman for the board. "Is it reasonable then for the state of 
California to forgive the tax although legally it may be owed?" 
</P>
<P>
Nor did officials in the agency believe, he said, that the new law was 
attacking a particularly egregious problem in California. He said studies have 
shown the advice given taxpayers by the agency is in error less than 10% of the 
time. By contrast, the IRS announced earlier this month that its own tests 
showed taxpayers who called a toll-free line for advice were getting wrong 
information 30.8% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employees Monitored 
</P>
<P>
Reber said employees who give oral advice to taxpayers are frequently monitored 
by their supervisors and tested annually on their knowledge of the tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The integrity of this department is recognized throughout the nation. The 
majority of people can rely on and be confident that the tax forms and 
information they get is accurate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Reber said the board does not consider the guidelines to be "in 
concrete." Indeed, in a memorandum from executive director Gerald Goldberg, the 
staff said it would support changes in the guidelines that would extend the 
protections to taxpayers who get other forms of written advice. For now, 
however, the board's policy remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
"While we do not agree with Mr. Collis with regard to his characterization of 
what we have done, we have nonetheless taken a second look at our guidelines to 
determine if we can be more flexible," Goldberg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Collis however, said he would ask the board to go even further and begin a 
campaign to inform taxpayers of their right to obtain the legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
Reber acknowledged that no mention of the new law was made in this year's 
California Resident Income Tax Forms and Instructions, but said that was 
because the tax information booklet was being printed just as the law was being 
passed.

HOTEL, CITING THREATS, REFUSES ROOMS FOR ANTI-ABORTION GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executives of an Anaheim hotel, saying they have received threats from several 
sources, have refused to book accommodations for Operation Rescue, a New 
York-based anti-abortion group that plans to blockade several Southern 
California family planning clinics later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The general manager recognized they are a very controversial group and did 
receive a threat from another source saying if he let Operation Rescue people 
stay at the hotel, they had better tighten their security," said Mary Garcia, 
public relations manager for the Ramada Hotel Group in Phoenix, which holds a 
franchise for the Ramada Main Gate, across from Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"He recognized this as a potentially dangerous situation for the other guests 
in the hotel," Garcia said of the decision not to book 50 to 100 rooms for 
Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Jeff Adler, a spokesman for the hotel, said the group was not 
welcome because they did not meet standard hotel requirements to provide a list 
of names of those who would be staying and to pay a room deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Adler also said that members of Operation Rescue tried to intimidate the hotel 
management into providing facilities. "They threatened to take it to Time 
magazine unless we do as they say." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Anaheim facility's owner, Roger Manfred, Adler said: 
"This hotel will not be held hostage by any group." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Tanner, director of the Operation Rescue office in Garden Grove, denounced 
the hotel's decision and called it "religious discrimination" at a news 
conference in the hotel parking lot Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said about 500 anti-abortion protesters -- including Operation Rescue's 
founder, Randall Terry -- are arriving in Southern California from around the 
nation to participate in sit-ins at undisclosed clinics in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties through Saturday. About 200 of those were expected to need 
hotel rooms in Orange County, where he said nightly rallies will be held. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blockade Plans 
</P>
<P>
The rejection by the hotel will not affect plans to blockade entrances of about 
three to five clinics a day for three days, beginning Thursday morning, 
spokesmen for Operation Rescue said. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, which claims 20,000 arrests of its members during scores of 
sit-ins nationwide over the past year, has created havoc in courts and jails in 
Atlanta, and in Sunnyvale in Northern California. Organizers expect about 2,000 
people to participate in the sit-ins at Southland clinics, and hundreds of 
pro-choice activists have pledged to be on hand to defend the rights of women 
to obtain medical services. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said Operation Rescue had planned to use the Ramada as a base during the 
protests and had reached an agreement Friday with the sales manager to provide 
rooms as available, an information table in the lobby and referral information 
to Operation Rescue followers who called from the airport. He said no deposit 
had been required. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday afternoon, he said, his organization received word that there 
would be no rooms available after all for Operation Rescue. Tanner said the 
sales manager confirmed that there was a "political problem" in housing the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"My question is -- and Randall Terry's question is -- can people be 
discriminated against based on their political and religious preferences?" 
Tanner asked. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group will staff an information table it plans to set up in the 
Ramada parking lot to advise "rescuers" of other hotels available in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner speculated that the telephone threat may have come from someone who 
learned of Operation Rescue's plans to stay at the Ramada through the group's 
telephone hot line. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he suspects pressure was exerted on the hotel manager by either 
an outsider who called the number, or by someone in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be a strong pro-abort community here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police said Tuesday that they have not been notified of any threats 
made against the hotel.

PROSECUTORS UNABLE TO LINK NOLAN TO REAGAN SIGNATURE FORGERY CASE

State prosecutors sought to indict former Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan 
in connection with the forgery of former President Ronald Reagan's signature on 
campaign letters but decided after presenting the case to a grand jury that 
they could not prove that Nolan had committed a crime, according to a deputy 
attorney general in charge of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp obtained an indictment only charging 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) with a single count of forgery in 
connection with the letters, which were sent to several hundred thousand 
California voters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We had gone in (to the Sacramento County Grand Jury) looking to obtain an 
indictment against both Assemblyman Lewis and Assemblyman Nolan," W. Scott 
Thorpe, the supervising deputy attorney general, said in an interview. "But 
after evaluating all the evidence, we just determined that there was 
insufficient evidence to indict anyone but Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe declined to provide further details of the Justice Department's strategy 
in the case, but his comments shed new light on a 350-page transcript of the 
grand jury's proceedings that was unsealed Friday. The transcript shows 
repeated attempts by Thorpe and co-prosecutor John A. Gordnier to place Nolan 
in the chain of events that led to the mailing of as many as 480,000 of the 
phony endorsements in six Assembly races. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, no witness linked Nolan directly to the order to send the 
letters without White House authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan, of Glendale, who resigned as Assembly GOP leader in November, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe told the grand jury in his opening statement Feb. 1 that at least two 
assemblymen -- Nolan and Lewis -- "knew prior to the letters being distributed 
that there had been no authorization from the President or the White House or 
the Republican National Committee." He asked the jury to consider charging 
Nolan and Lewis with forgery and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors called nine witnesses, including two Republican aides, Henry 
Olsen and Richard Temple, and a GOP consultant, Tim Macy, who were directly 
involved either in seeking White House approval for the letters or mailing them 
to voters. All three said they conferred regularly with Nolan and Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was implicated by both Olsen and Macy, and all three operatives testified 
that Nolan told them to lie to the White House to protect him from 
embarrassment after the phony endorsements were exposed. But no witness 
provided firsthand knowledge of Nolan giving the directive to mail the letters 
without White House consent. 
</P>
<P>
Macy testified that Lewis told him that "they were debating whether they were 
going (to) ask for approval or not." 
</P>
<P>
"Did he define who 'they' was?" Macy was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The Assembly Republican leadership," Macy answered. "The handful of people 
that Assemblyman Nolan would have around him helping making those decisions in 
the campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans did submit drafts of their letters for approval, but the White 
House rejected them in mid-October, Olsen said. The President's aides suggested 
instead that the Californians use generic, "fill-in-the-blank" letters that 
could be adapted for any candidate. Even these were supposed to be returned to 
the White House for final approval before being mailed. 
</P>
<P>
When he told Lewis of the White House rejection, Olsen said, Lewis told him the 
unauthorized letters would "probably go out anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Macy said the order to send the letters was given to him by Lewis in a 
long-distance telephone conversation Oct. 24. Macy, in Sacramento, called 
Lewis, who was at a GOP leadership meeting in the Fullerton district office of 
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra), and asked if the letters should be 
mailed, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis put him on hold, conferred with the other lawmakers and returned to the 
phone to give the go-ahead, Macy said. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted the letters mailed," Macy said. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan told him later that he was at the meeting, and that Assemblyman Dennis 
Brown (R-Los Alamitos) also attended, Macy testified. He said Lewis told him 
Johnson was there. None of the lawmakers was asked to testify before the grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe said Nolan and Lewis were not called because they were targets of the 
probe. Brown was not asked to testify because he had exercised his 5th 
Amendment rights against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was interviewed by prosecutors, who determined that his recollection of 
the meeting was too weak to add anything to the case. 
</P>
<P>
That left Macy's account of the telephone conversation with Lewis as the only 
evidence implicating a legislator in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony such as the following was typical of how prosecutors repeatedly fell 
short in their effort to prove that Nolan was connected to the scheme: 
</P>
<P>
Macy said Nolan was aware that the letters mailed by the Republicans were not 
the generic forms received from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"So he knew that that was (a) different set of letters, that they were not the 
same. Is that correct?" Thorpe asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Correct," Macy replied. 
</P>
<P>
But he could not say whether Nolan knew this before the election. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember," he said.

Three Irish members of a U.N. peacekeeping force were killed Tuesday when their 
vehicle ran over a land mine in south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
An Irish officer said the mine exploded near Braachit on the edge of Israel's 
self-declared security zone just north of the Israeli border. More than 160 
U.N. servicemen have been killed since the 6,000-member peacekeeping force was 
assigned to Lebanon in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The officer said the attack was aimed at U.N. troops, and U.N. Secretary 
General Javier Perez de Cuellar ordered an investigation. But an Israeli 
official said the target was probably the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army 
militia.

AFGHAN REBELS POORLY EQUIPPED FOR JALALABAD SIEGE, ANALYSTS SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Afghan rebels attacking Jalalabad have been hampered by poor coordination, 
equipment unsuitable for a siege, mine fields and bombing, Western diplomatic 
analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the first two weeks of fighting around the eastern Afghan city, 
the analysts said there is no indication that Jalalabad will be taken soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Western-backed moujahedeen guerrillas need to coordinate pressure on 
Jalalabad from all sides and cut it off from Kabul, the Afghan capital, by air 
and road, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Jalalabad airport, focus of the last two weeks' fighting, has been closed to 
fixed-wing aircraft since the battle began, the rebels say. 
</P>
<P>
The Western analysts said the initial attack was badly organized. The 
guerrillas did not have enough time to involve local tribal elders or make 
proper attempts to win over commanders of military units in the besieged 
garrison. 
</P>
<P>
After the unexpectedly quick capture of a government stronghold at Samarkhel, 
the attackers pushed on impetuously to the airport where the offensive was 
halted, the rebels say. 
</P>
<P>
The Western diplomats said the moujahedeen equipment is more suited for 
guerrilla warfare than a siege. The rebels' rockets are largely ineffective 
against entrenched defenders. 
</P>
<P>
The moujahedeen are still confident of victory, while President Najibullah's 
government says the rebel advance has been halted with heavy guerrilla 
casualties. It accuses Pakistani troops of assisting the rebels. Pakistan 
denies that its troops are in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, Najibullah, in a speech ushering in the Afghan new year, urged the 
United Nations to set up monitoring posts on the Pakistani border to halt the 
rebel offensive. 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan leader addressed his nation in a speech broadcast late Monday night 
as the guerrillas based in Pakistan pressed their two-week-old siege of 
Jalalabad. 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah noted that the United Nations established checkpoints along the 
Soviet border to monitor the departure of Soviet soldiers, who completed their 
withdrawal from Afghanistan on Feb. 15, and he said the same should be done 
along the Pakistani border. 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan year 1368, which follows an Islamic calendar different from that of 
most Muslim nations, began Tuesday with a bleakness caused by both weather and 
the weariness of war. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were big turnouts at major Kabul mosques, there was little sign 
of celebration. A drizzle turned the streets to mud and kept most people 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER CASUALTY 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan rebel drive to capture the key city of Jalalabad has left hundreds 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting has also severed Kabul-Peshawar route used by smugglers to transport 
Soviet goods, which meant money for border tribes that back rebels.

100 NATIONS STRIVING TO AGREE ON PACT TO CURB TOXIC WASTE EXPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BASEL, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An international conference on toxic waste grappled late Tuesday with the 
difficult issue of the export by developed countries of poisonous garbage to 
less-developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of more than 100 countries, arranged by the United Nations 
Environmental Program, had agreed on the provisions for a treaty after 18 
months of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
A draft of that treaty was submitted to the countries here in Basel, selected 
as a meeting site by the United Nations partly because the Swiss are proud of 
this city's cleanup of toxic problems caused by chemical plant emissions into 
the Rhine River. However, after committee members' recommendations on the 
treaty were sent to the full meeting, objections were raised. 
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that most complaints came from nations that had not 
participated in the year and a half of talks that attempted to narrow the toxic 
waste issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that everyone was roughly agreed on a treaty," said one U.N. 
official here late Tuesday, "but then we found there were many other nations 
that suddenly sent delegates here who raised objections in the form of 
amendments to the treaty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weight Against Industrial Nations Urged 
</P>
<P>
These objections generally suggested that any convention should be heavily 
weighted against those nations that export toxic wastes -- including the United 
States and most other industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace, the environmental organization, has been urging African nations to 
support a ban on all exports of toxic -- or almost any other -- waste. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, aides to Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the U.N. 
Environmental Program, said they thought that many nations will vote today in 
favor of the idea of banning shipments of toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
However, they admitted that while some nations might agree to a treaty, most 
others would simply indicate their assent to the idea that poisonous-waste 
exports should be banned -- but would not necessarily commit themselves to such 
laws.

CARGO PLANE CRASHES INTO SAO PAULO SLUM; 21 KILLED

<TEXT>
<P>
A cargo plane loaded with television sets and toys slammed into a heavily 
populated slum Tuesday, killing at least 21 people and reportedly injuring more 
than 200 on the outskirts of Brazil's main commercial city. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers feared that many more people might be buried beneath rubble in the 
crowded area. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Transbrasil Boeing 707, crashed outside of Sao Paulo International 
airport, first hitting a three-story building and then skidding into a hillside 
shantytown. 
</P>
<P>
"We rescued a baby of about 6 months who was lying unharmed right near the 
burning wreckage," firefighter Rogerio Ramos Marcelino told Reuters news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the child survived, he said: "Only God knows." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the scene said the Transbrasil plane's crew of three and at least 15 
on the ground died in the crash. Television reports said that about 200 people 
were being treated in nearby hospitals, mostly for burns. 
</P>
<P>
The plane smashed into a three-story building, leaving an engine and part of 
its left wing before coming to a stop several hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, airport officials said the plane had exploded in midair. Transbrasil 
officials said, however, that the plane had not exploded but had crashed into 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
Survivor Paulo Sergio Oliveira de Queiroz said he escaped with facial cuts 
after the plane ripped the roof off the shed where he was working. 
</P>
<P>
Oliveira, 19, said he had just made a telephone call. "Everything just fell on 
top of me. I ran out of the building and I saw a car burning and a lot of 
dust." 
</P>
<P>
Television reports said doctors performed an emergency Caesarean operation on a 
pregnant woman killed in the crash. The baby was born alive but apparently died 
shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flight Recorders 
</P>
<P>
Investigators at the scene said they had found the plane's flight recorders. 
</P>
<P>
Visibility was good when the plane crashed. Airport officials said earlier that 
the pilot had radioed the control tower demanding an emergency landing, but 
Transbrasil officials were unable to confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
Boxes of television sets, radios and toys, some undamaged, lay on the ground. 
The plane was carrying 26 tons of goods from factories in a manufacturing zone 
set up in the Amazon town of Manaus to encourage investment and jobs in the 
region.

'THIN BLUE LINE' SUSPECT FREED, FACES NEW TRIAL

Randall Dale Adams, who once was three days from execution for the slaying of a 
police officer, was freed Tuesday under a court ruling that he didn't get a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I've dreamed about for 12 1/2 years," Adams said after the 
release order was cleared in some last-minute legal action. "It's here, but 
give me a little bit of time to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Adams, whose conviction was questioned in the documentary film "The Thin Blue 
Line," had been ordered released on a $50,000 personal recognizance bond set 
Monday by state District Judge Larry Baraka. But prosecutors had tried to get 
Baraka removed from the case, saying he was biased in Adams' favor. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution succeeded in getting the bond raised to $100,000 cash surety 
late Monday, keeping Adams in prison another night. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Errol Morris, who directed "The Thin Blue Line," announced he 
would put up the money to meet the higher bond. 
</P>
<P>
But District Judge Ron Chapman subsequently revoked the higher amount after 
talking to Baraka in chambers. 
</P>
<P>
That cleared the way for Adams' release from the Lew Sterrett Justice Center 
without having to put up any money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Retrial 
</P>
<P>
In a related hearing, visiting state District Judge Carl Anderson cleared 
Baraka to hear the case should prosecutors decide to retry Adams for the 1976 
killing of patrolman Robert Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Winfield Scott said he intends to retry Adams for the 
shooting, but may reduce the charge from capital murder to murder. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said he was happy that two courts had ruled in his favor but said he 
won't feel vindicated unless his name is cleared in a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was condemned to die in 1977, but the sentence was commuted to life in 
prison in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thin Blue Line" suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecution's 
chief witness, David Harris, who is on Death Row for another slaying but was 
not charged in the Wood killing. During a hearing in December, Harris recanted 
his trial testimony and told Baraka that Adams did not kill the policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Based in part on that testimony, Baraka recommended that Adams' conviction be 
set aside and wrote a letter supporting parole. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed, and on March 1 unanimously 
overturned Adams' conviction.

FLETCHER, WHO HEADED NASA IN DARKEST HOURS, TO QUIT 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James C. Fletcher, who returned to the helm of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration during its darkest hours, announced his resignation 
Tuesday, effective April 8. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 69, who had served as NASA administrator from April of 1971 to May of 
1977, reluctantly accepted the post in 1986 for a second time in the aftermath 
of the Challenger explosion, the nation's worst space disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation came as no surprise in that Fletcher had made it clear that he 
wanted to retire as soon as President Bush named a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at NASA said they thought Fletcher went ahead and announced his 
decision before the replacement was picked in hopes of accelerating the 
process. Many in NASA are extremely anxious over who will head the agency 
because the appointment could serve as an indication of how strongly the Bush 
Administration will push space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Selection of a strong leader who would be willing to do battle with Congress in 
these days of budgetary limitations would indicate that the Administration 
plans to aggressively pursue the many items on the agency's agenda, including 
the construction of a permanently manned space station by the end of the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Fletcher is seen as having been a strong administrator but an 
uninspiring leader in the three years of his current term as head of the 
embattled agency. He is credited with completing a major overhaul of NASA's top 
management structure, getting the authorization and money to build a 
replacement for the Challenger and keeping the space station alive. 
</P>
<P>
NASA's deputy administrator, Dale Myers, will serve as acting administrator 
until Fletcher's successor is picked.

U.S. PANEL TO REVIEW PLANS FOR DRILLING OFF CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA

<P>
The White House, moving forward on a major environmental front, Tuesday 
established a task force to review plans to drill for oil off the California 
and Florida coasts. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, to be headed by Interior Secretary Manuel J. Lujan, is to "examine 
in detail the concerns over adverse impacts" of Lease Sale 91 off Northern 
California, Lease Sale 95 off Southern California, and Lease Sale 116 off 
southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that the 
panel had been broadened to include the chiefs of the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or their 
designees. Their omission from earlier discussions of the task force had 
angered environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement also served as a rejoinder to critics within the 
Administration, who earlier this month accused the White House of moving slowly 
on the offshore drilling issue. 
</P>
<P>
The review, promised by President Bush in an address to Congress in January, 
represents a significant reconsideration of the Reagan Administration's plans 
to broaden the scope of offshore drilling on outer continental shelves. 
</P>
<P>
A leading opponent of offshore drilling, Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), 
welcomed the White House action, saying that he hopes it will mark "the first 
step in the development of a sensible policy on this very difficult issue." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater made clear, however, that the President remains "committed to 
continued outer continental shelf oil and gas development in an environmentally 
sound manner. 
</P>
<P>
"The President feels that oil and gas development of America's offshore areas 
is necessary to ensure a reliable supply of energy and provide for the nation's 
economic and national security," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is to report its findings to Bush by Jan. 1, 1990.

SAN DIEGAN TIED TO PLANE BOMB THREATS;

<P>
CALLS FROM HOSPITAL HELP FBI IN CASE THAT 'CAUSED A LOT OF HAVOC'

A man FBI officials believe is responsible for more than 100 bomb threats to 
airlines operating out of San Diego, San Francisco and Detroit from 1985 to 
1989 has been arrested in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
William Albert Risley, 50, a resident of the Golden West Hotel in the 700 block 
of 4th Avenue since January, was arrested Monday in downtown San Diego by FBI 
agent Samuel Stanton after agents matched his voice to a series of threats that 
began in Detroit in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airline Information Found 
</P>
<P>
In his affidavit, Stanton said Risley possessed "airline directories and quick 
reference airline schedules for airlines operating out of Lindbergh Field." 
</P>
<P>
Risley is allegedly responsible for an undetermined number of bomb threats to 
airlines operating at Detroit Metropolitan Airport from 1985 to 1987; 88 bomb 
threats to San Francisco International Airport from October, 1987, to May, 
1988, and more than 20 bomb threats at Lindbergh Field, FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to one FBI agent close to the investigation, Risley is responsible 
for many other bomb threats besides those called in to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"He's caused a lot of havoc wherever he's gone," the agent said. FBI officials 
did not reveal a motive for the threats. 
</P>
<P>
Risley is being charged with three counts of making false bomb threats to an 
airline, which could bring five years per offense, the FBI said. Those threats 
were made to airlines in San Diego, but no bombs were found. He is being held 
at Metropolitan Correctional Center pending a March 28 detention hearing. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, FBI officials suspect Risley because of "the text 
of the calls, similarities in the voice characteristics, and voice recognition 
of previously recorded calls. Voice characteristics of the caller were 
described as nasal sounding, effeminate and possessing a speech impediment." 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit says the caller repeatedly used the words airliner, automatically 
timed explosive device, plastic explosive, bomb and explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
A call Risley allegedly made March 6 from Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital 
allowed FBI agents to track him down through hospital records. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, the first threatening call by Risley in the San 
Diego area came Dec. 30, when someone called American Airlines and said, "This 
is an emergency. Listen carefully. There is an electronic bomb device on your 
11:35 a.m. flight to Dallas / Ft. Worth from San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Flight 66 was delayed while the aircraft and its luggage were searched before 
being cleared for takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
From Dec. 30, 1988, to Jan. 21, 1989, the FBI investigated seven such calls to 
Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Dec. 30, 1988, various airlines at San Diego International Airport have 
received in excess of 20 telephonic bomb threats believed to be perpetrated by 
William A. Risley based on the text of the calls, similarities in voice 
characteristics and through voice recognition of previously recorded calls," 
the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, on Jan. 21, 1989, Pacific Bell officials placed a 
"trap and trace" device on the phone number to Harbor Police at Lindbergh 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 30, FBI agents in San Francisco and Detroit informed San Diego FBI 
agents that the person responsible for 88 bomb threats in San Francisco 
International Airport from Oct. 14, 1987, to May 12, 1988, sounded like the 
same man who made an undetermined number of bomb threats to airlines at Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport from June 17, 1985, to April 8, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similarities Noticed 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 1, San Francisco FBI informed San Diego FBI that, based on a review of 
a taped bomb threat to USAir in San Diego on Jan. 25, 1989, the caller sounded 
like the one who had made threats in San Francisco and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
On March 6, a voice was again taped making a bomb threat to Lindbergh Field 
regarding Delta Air Lines Flight 1805 from San Diego to Salt Lake City. The 
officer who received the call reviewed the recording, compared it to other 
taped threats and reported to the FBI that it sounded like the same person. 
</P>
<P>
Risley allegedly made another call March 6, 1989, at 4:12 p.m., that was traced 
to a public telephone outside the emergency room of the Physicians &amp; 
Surgeons Hospital. On March 7, FBI agents reviewed outpatient records at the 
hospital for March 6. Risley had been seen by a doctor at the hospital at 2:39 
p.m. FBI officials would not say what Risley was being treated for. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, an FBI agent watched Risley make a call from the same phone used 
to make the bomb threat March 6. That same day, a threat was made for Alaska 
Airlines Flight 221 from San Diego to Seattle. Risley was arrested four days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Though airport manager Bud McDonald said "hallelujah" to the arrest, he was 
pessimistic that it would decrease bomb threats. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem . . . is that you get a lot of copycats. If you announce 
they've picked up a guy, then tomorrow or the next day, someone else will 
call."

NAVY SAYS AGENCY HAD WARNING BEFORE 4 DIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Navy officials said Tuesday they made two calls to the county's child-abuse hot 
line last week to express concern about the welfare of three children who died 
Monday in a fire authorities believe was set by the children's mother, a 
despondent Navy wife. 
</P>
<P>
County officials acknowledge receiving one of the calls, but said they never 
opened a file on the case or sent a caseworker to investigate whether the 
children were in danger and needed to be removed from the home. 
</P>
<P>
"Our worker never felt that that (the possibility of danger) had been 
communicated to her," said Ray Fellers, deputy director for Children's 
Services. "The worker's understanding was that the concern dealt with whether 
there was adequate food and finances available to the family." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threatened Suicide 
</P>
<P>
Monday's house fire on Brandywood Street in Paradise Hills claimed the lives of 
36-year-old Esperanza Cabalbag and her three children: Jamie, 9; Tamara, 7; and 
Filomeno Jr., 5. San Diego homicide detectives say they suspect the blaze was 
intentionally set by Mrs. Cabalbag, who had been depressed for some time over 
financial and other family problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy wife threatened suicide in a letter received last week by her husband, 
Filomeno, a senior chief machinist mate who has been at sea since Dec. 1 on the 
guided missile destroyer Henry B. Wilson. The suicide threat prompted police to 
visit Mrs. Cabalbag on March 15, when they confiscated a shotgun and advised 
her to seek counseling for her depression. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials also said they were so concerned about Mrs. Cabalbag's chronic 
depression that they called the hot line, used to report child abuse or 
neglect. Navy officials said Monday that a worried chaplain called the hot line 
March 16 and was promised immediate action because of the "urgent situation" 
involving the Cabalbag children. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a Navy spokesman, Cmdr. Dave Dillon said that, two days before the 
chaplain had called the hot line, a call had been made by a Navy ombudsman to 
report Mrs. Cabalbag's troubled emotional state. 
</P>
<P>
"She called the hot line and expressed her belief that the woman may have been 
heading in the direction of suicidal tendencies," said Dillon. "The (agency) 
gave assurances that somebody would take action within 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon said that the ombudsman, whom he declined to identify, told the 
Children's Services employee that the family "didn't have a lot of food or any 
food in the house and that the woman was a little bit withdrawn." 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the hot-line call, the Children's Services employee asked 
the ombudsman directly whether Mrs. Cabalbag exhibited suicidal tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
"She said they were were definitely heading in that direction," said Dillon, 
adding that the ombudsman was assured that the county agency would "do 
something within 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Receiving Call 
</P>
<P>
Fellers said his agency has no record of the call. "As far as I'm concerned, we 
never received a call on the hot line about it on the 14th," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that reports of parents' suicidal tendencies usually prompt 
an emergency investigation by the county agency, which would determine whether 
the children should be removed from the home for their own protection. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have what we feel is a pretty credible report of someone suicidal, yeah, 
we're going to go out," said Fellers. "We do that immediately, we get one of 
our emergency response workers to head on out." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the agency would consider a call from a Navy ombudsman a credible 
report, Fellers said: "Generally speaking, yes we would." 
</P>
<P>
Fellers said his agency's records show only the March 16 call from the Navy 
chaplain about the Cabalbags. Citing confidentiality laws, he declined to 
identify the hot-line worker who took the call or to release her written notes 
about the conversation, which county officials have maintained centered on 
where the family could find more money for food. 
</P>
<P>
Fellers defended his agency's decision not to open a file or immediately 
investigate the problems with the Cabalbag family, adding that the employee who 
took the chaplain's call is a "very experienced worker" with four years of 
hot-line work. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Navy's Dillon said Tuesday that the chaplain did more than tell the 
county agency the Cabalbag family needed money and food. 
</P>
<P>
"He was concerned about the children . . . based on the woman's mental state as 
he observed it. She was obviously agitated and upset, and things were bearing 
down on her." 
</P>
<P>
A Navy source, who asked not to be identified, stressed that the calls from the 
ombudsman and chaplain should have underscored to Children's Services workers 
that the Cabalbag youngsters were in danger. The Navy has a variety of 
resources to deal with immediate hunger problems or destitution, the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Removed Gun 
</P>
<P>
"If a mother's suicidal, and the father is seven zillion miles away, it is 
obvious there is a dysfunction in the family," said the source. "If a call 
comes in from the . . . ombudsman, it's already serious." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ed Petrick of the San Diego Police homicide division said Tuesday that two 
police officers visited Mrs. Cabalbag on March 15 and confiscated a shotgun 
after discussing her written suicide threat. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'If you were going to commit suicide, what would you do it with?' " 
Petrick said. "She said, 'Well, my husband's got a gun.' They said, 'Gee, would 
you mind if we took it from you for safekeeping?' " 
</P>
<P>
Petrick also said that investigators at the fire scene have found three 
canisters of kerosene in the house, where many fires were started early Monday 
morning. One fire was started where family photos were piled up near the living 
room couch, doused with kerosene and then lit, said Petrick. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the county coroner's office said Tuesday that autopsies on two 
of the Cabalbag children showed that they died of smoke inhalation. Autopsies 
for Mrs. Cabalbag and the third child had not been completed by late Tuesday, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Filomeno Cabalbag was informed of the tragedy late Monday and was scheduled to 
leave his ship for emergency leave in San Diego. The Navy declined to divulge 
the ship's location.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THE ANNALS OF BLOOPERDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oops. Or: Pardon my blooper, legal variety. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of the city attorney, the San Diego City Council on Monday 
quietly adopted an emergency ordinance to amend Division 95 of Chapter 5 of the 
Municipal Code, effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment substitutes "division" for "chapter" in a section adopted in 
February, 1988, to ban housing and job discrimination against people with AIDS. 
The anti-discrimination ordinance allows victims to sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
However, the original language mistakenly said that no criminal penalties shall 
be attached to this "chapter" -- not just the AIDS division as intended -- thus 
seemingly extending the no-criminal-prosecution provision to a raft of 
miscreant behavior covered by all divisions of Chapter 5. 
</P>
<P>
Such behavior includes nude dancing, shooting a gun within the city limits, 
public urination, liquor sales violations and failure to abate loud noises or 
weed-clogged property -- in short, the tacky stuff that coarsens modern life. 
</P>
<P>
When the division/chapter mix-up was spotted, the city attorney immediately 
asked the council to set the code straight, lest a sharp-eyed defense attorney 
spot a loophole. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Swett, senior chief deputy city attorney, says prosecutors could probably 
have persuaded a judge that the council never meant to lift criminal penalties 
for all of Chapter 5. 
</P>
<P>
"With the amount of legislation we adopt, the possibility of something like 
this (the mix-up) happening is always there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tony on Tour 
</P>
<P>
Attention all cars: Be on the lookout for a furry adult male, with orange, 
black and white stripes, often heard to say "Grrrrrrrreat." 
</P>
<P>
The Kellogg Co., manufacturers of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, has deployed its 
</P>
<P>
"famous spokes- character" Tony the Tiger on a national tour, giving away 
bicycles for those lucky enough to have a box of his favorite Cornflakes on 
hand when he comes knocking. 
</P>
<P>
The tour comes to San Diego for a week starting Sunday. To ensure that Tony 
isn't pinched by the police as he goes door to door, the corporate headquarters 
in Battle Creek, Mich., sent a letter of warning to Police Chief Bob Burgreen. 
</P>
<P>
Enclosed was an autographed picture of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Prayer Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for the opening session to open with a prayer, but the 19th annual 
Convention of American Atheists commences Friday at the Marriott Hotel in 
Mission Valley. A record 500 conventioneers are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Among the topics will be creeping creationism, introducing children to atheism, 
the use of "anti-blasphemy" laws to silence atheists in Austria and Germany, 
and a psychological look at "What Makes Religionists Tick." 
</P>
<P>
The opening-day highlight will be a "Bimbos for Satan" lecture by Arizona 
atheist leader Conrad Goeringer. He says that discovering satanic messages in 
rock music by playing Guns 'N Roses records backward, etc., is a thinly 
disguised try at censorship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downey for the Count 
</P>
<P>
The crowd for Monday night's World Wrestling Federation show at the San Diego 
Sports Arena was even more excited than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was there a full card of favorites, but it was announced that WWF has 
added Morton Downey Jr., the razor-tongued talk show host, for WrestleMania V 
on April 2 at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N. J. Downey will debate/accost a 
WWF character called Brother Love, with wrestler-turned-actor Rowdy Roddy Piper 
as referee. 
</P>
<P>
"Three of the loudest loudmouths ever seen on television," promised a WWF 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
WrestleMania V can be seen locally on a pay-for-view basis through cable 
operators. In the wake of Monday's tour stop, sign-ups (at $24.95) were brisk. 
</P>
<P>
"WrestleMania is big," said Sandy Cochran, director of public affairs for 
Southwestern Cable, which serves San Diego north of Interstate 8.

SCRIPPS RESEARCH VESSEL SEIZED AS TINY AMOUNT OF POT IS FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A scientific research ship operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
has been seized by U. S. Customs officials in Honolulu after a search with dogs 
turned up a small amount of marijuana allegedly belonging to a low-ranking 
crewman. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure Monday of the Thomas Washington, a 209-foot vessel that is Scripps' 
second-largest research ship, was made under the federal government's 
controversial "zero tolerance" anti-drug campaign and is the second such 
seizure of a research ship in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Customs agents in San Diego seized the Atlantis II, the grand dame of 
the U. S. research fleet, after agents found a trace of marijuana in a 
crewman's shaving kit. The vessel, owned by the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution in Massachusetts, wasn't formally returned for two months, though 
it was allowed to continue its scientific work. 
</P>
<P>
That seizure and others drew widespread public and congressional criticism and 
prompted Customs to quietly back away from some cases involving minuscule 
amounts of drugs or drug paraphernalia. The Coast Guard also modified its 
seizure policies. And just last month, the federal government further revised 
its policies, saying it would stop seizing fishing boats in cases in which only 
"personal amounts" of drugs are found. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Monday's seizure, Customs officials conducted an "intensive 
search" of the Thomas Washington using drug-sniffing dogs. Authorities found 
4.5 grams of marijuana hidden in a berth of crew member Kenneth G. Racca Jr., 
28, a wiper who is from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, which is owned by the Navy but has been operated by Scripps since 
1965, left San Diego a year ago on a yearlong research cruise. When it docked 
in Honolulu on Monday, it was returning from Pago Pago in American Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps spokesman Chuck Colgan said the vessel was routinely searched by the 
ship's captain before docking at the University of Hawaii's Pier 45 in Honolulu 
Harbor in preparation for Customs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why the dogs were there," said Colgan. "At this amount (of 
marijuana), we're not talking about smuggling. It's for personal use, if that." 
</P>
<P>
The boat carries a crew of 15 and about 15 scientists. Both crew members and 
scientists must sign a document acknowledging that no drugs will be tolerated 
on board. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomas Washington is scheduled to depart Honolulu on Saturday for a 30-day 
research cruise around Hawaii, and is due back in San Diego about May 29, 
Colgan said. 
</P>
<P>
But Scripps officials are worried that the seizure could be costly, if the ship 
is not allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is this matter can be resolved soon . . . and that Scripps can leave 
port on schedule," said Scripps' director Edward A. Frieman in a prepared 
statement. "Expeditions are planned years in advance and require the 
coordination of people and materials from very many organizations from around 
the world. A delay in the ship's departure from Honolulu would have a 
considerable adverse impact on the effectiveness and expense of the balance of 
the crew's operations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crewman to Appear in Court 
</P>
<P>
George Roberts, Customs Service district director in Honolulu, said Tuesday 
that the vessel could be returned to Scripps after an administrative 
petitioning process and payment of a fine. And another Customs official in 
Hawaii said, "We'll do all we can to expedite the release of this ship." 
</P>
<P>
Colgan, the Scripps spokesman, said the institution was not certain what it 
would have to do to get the boat released, but he said that Scripps hopes to 
avoid a fine, because no fine was levied in the Atlantis II seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Racca, the crew member, is scheduled to appear in federal court in Honolulu on 
Thursday, where he faces one charge each of importation and possession of a 
controlled substance. A court spokeswoman told the Associated Press that he 
would likely be fined and released. 
</P>
<P>
Colgan said Racca's duties as a wiper involved "spending his day wiping things 
off, like oily engines and things." 
</P>
<P>
John Miller, a spokesman for Customs in Los Angeles, said Tuesday that the 
agency has modified its zero-tolerance policy only in relation to commercial 
fishing vessels. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug crackdown, which began last spring, is still in force for all 
other vessels, including the one operated by Scripps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under zero tolerance, boats can be seized by Customs if even minute amounts of 
drugs are found on board. 
</P>
<P>
However, if small amounts of drugs are found on commercial fishing vessels, he 
said, the vessels are placed under "constructive seizure," meaning that the 
owners may continue operating the boats until their legal cases are resolved. 
Physical seizure of such boats might cause "undue hardship" on innocent owners 
who might be unaware of the actions of their crews, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Scripps vessel is not a commercial fishing vessel, it was 
physically seized, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the zero-tolerance campaign began last spring, 17 boats have been seized 
by Customs in its Western region, which includes seven Western states, he said. 
All but two have been returned to their owners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Either Scripps or the Navy has the right to appeal the seizure through legal 
channels, Miller said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol is investigating a traffic accident Tuesday that 
killed a Navy warship crewman. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Maroon, a petty officer third class assigned to the destroyer Cushing, 
was one of three sailors in a pickup truck headed north on Proctor Valley Road 
at 10:20 p.m. Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said the driver, Jorge L. Perelpa, 24, of Chula Vista, lost control of 
the truck about 2 1/2 miles south of San Miguel Road. The truck rolled and 
ejected Maroon. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman would not identify the third man but said he and the driver 
were treated at the Balboa Navy Hospital on Tuesday and released. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy for Maroon is scheduled today, Deputy Coroner Chuck Bolton said.

Tuesday was Day 4 of Spring Break '89 at South Mission Beach. The wind was 
brisk, the water a feisty 58 degrees, and no one seemed to care. Soares said he 
hadn't yet found God -- he looked around just to make sure -- but had found 
scores of "sun worshipers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising to the Top 
</P>
<P>
Most of them, including Soares, had come to one conclusion: San Diego, they 
said, especially South Mission Beach, is now No. 1 on the list of places to 
flee during the annual spring break, which began with the close of class last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs, the students said, used to be everyone's favorite hot spot. But 
beefed-up police action after a riot in 1986 has turned many away. That 
bottle-throwing melee, which erupted on Good Friday, cost Palm Springs $100,000 
in overtime pay for police officers and $40,000 in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The Springs," as the students call it, just hasn't been the same since, even 
with Sonny Bono as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we'd all rather come to San Diego," said Soares, a pensive, 21-year-old 
junior at California State College, Stanislaus, in Turlock. "The police are a 
lot more mellow here." 
</P>
<P>
Soares said spring break is "great, because the timing couldn't be better. 
Now's the time of year when kids are usually getting burned out from too much 
studying. Even so, you see a lot of people on the beach today studying, like I 
am. It gives you an opportunity to catch up on your homework. If you didn't 
have a break like this, you'd go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frontal Assaults 
</P>
<P>
Of course, going crazy is the charge that confronts college students every year 
as they prepare for what some consider frontal assaults on beach communities 
from Mexico to Key West, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Soares finds it amusing that all of the San Diego State University students he 
knows are hell-bent on escaping to Florida, while all of the Floridians want to 
come to California, and everyone else has their pick of either. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Sumners, a 20-year-old junior from Southern Oregon State College, said she 
and her two girlfriends just came from Palm Springs, where they were cited for 
what she said was just walking in the street. 
</P>
<P>
"The Springs was really a dreary scene," said Sumners, flanked by Lisa Preston, 
a 19-year-old sophomore at Oregon State University, and Kelli York, a 
21-year-old junior from Southern Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
These three headed down from rainy Oregon and found the prevailing opinion to 
be true: "San Diego," in Sumner's view, "is now the alternative to Palm 
Springs, which is for old folks anyway. I mean, this is really a cool place. 
</P>
<P>
"In Palm Springs, there were three cops on every block. We just got bored 
there. They've really clamped down on the college students, and all we're 
trying to do is have a good time. In Palm Springs, you just drive up and down 
the strip and go to the bars at night. Here, the beaches are great, the cops 
are few, and Mexico is half an hour away. You can't beat it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet on Western Front 
</P>
<P>
So far, the influx of students hasn't created a significant problem for local 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a major problem," said police spokesman Bill Robinson. He said last 
weekend "was extremely quiet, surprisingly so. Our officers closed down seven 
parties, mainly in the South Mission Beach area. But we experienced no 
resistance problems from beachgoers. We had no major problems and no felony 
arrests. We do, however, expect many more this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
A bigger threat may be the ocean itself. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Beach lifeguards Charles Davey, 27, and Matthew Roland, 28, worry not 
so much about beer drinking -- which you can do on area beaches, as long as 
it's in a can and not a glass or bottle -- but the lack of education that 
spring-break revelers bring to the water after a winter of inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
"The break isn't a problem yet, but the potential is always there," Davey said. 
"I'm worried about this weekend. The crowds last weekend were the biggest I've 
seen since July 4, and we're expecting even more Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The break is rough because of what the crowds don't know and how ill-equipped 
they are to handle the cool temperature of the water and the seasonal shape of 
the ocean floor. The bottom is really torn up right now. Holes are everywhere, 
worse than usual. Where there are holes there are rip currents, usually pretty 
nasty ones. You're constantly keeping an eye on people. Even now, you can see 
people heading way off out there. Our biggest job is just re-educating people 
about the water and what it can do. It ain't easy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chilly Wind No Factor 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, though, none of the beachgoers seemed the least bit fazed by the 
cooler-than-normal breezes or by the Frigidaire surf temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Etheridge, 20, a freshman at Ventura College, and Jennifer Webb, 19, a 
sophomore at Moorpark College, drove in over the weekend from the San Fernando 
Valley. They wanted to go to Mexico but found the sight of San Diego so 
appealing they pulled off Interstate 5 and checked in at a $50-a-night hotel. 
After a night of that, they were at a $20-a-night camping village, shivering in 
a pup tent. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he had made an informal study, Etheridge, a business major, rated the 
top spring-break getaways as "San Diego, Palm Springs, Daytona Beach, Fla., Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., and Virginia Beach, Va." 
</P>
<P>
He said cost is a big factor. He and his girlfriend work two jobs besides going 
to school and just "didn't have the bucks to go to Florida, which isn't as nice 
as San Diego anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Preston from Oregon State University said many Oregonians head to Lake 
Tahoe, Nev., for snow -- rather than sun -- comfort. Housing is expensive, so 
she and her friends are staying for free with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Kelli York from Southern Oregon State College said their chief spring-break 
ambition can be summarized in a four-letter word: 
</P>
<P>
"G-u-y-s. And we're trying," she added, in a tone of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, Richard Clock, a 19-year-old sophomore at UC San Diego, was 
scowling for a different reason. An English literature major, he was finding it 
difficult to free his mind of Dryden, Milton, Wordsworth and Pope. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Literary Void Possible? 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I look," he said of his fellow students, "I wonder if they've read 
the same neo-classic and romantic writers that I have. . . . I wonder if 
they've read at all." 
</P>
<P>
His friend, Alex Alvarez, 20, and a sophomore at Mesa College, was happy just 
to be taking in the sun, the sand and the sights -- regardless of who reads 
what. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to get drunk and obnoxious to have a good time," Alvarez said. 
"A good time can be just sitting here. It beats the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Jann Rouille, 40, from Covina, and her mother, Helen King, 68, from La Mesa, 
were happy that Tuesday's crowd was remarkably free of drunk, obnoxious 
rowdyism, even if the stereos were a bit loud. 
</P>
<P>
"All the talk about how bad it is makes it sound much worse than it is," King 
said. "A lot of these kids are studying, with notebooks in hand. I haven't seen 
anything unruly or out of the ordinary. And we're having a wonderful time, not 
just in spite of these kids but partly because of them. I think we should let 
them be."

CAUSE OF COPTER CRASH REMAINS PUZZLE 
</P>

As authorities continued to search for clues to the cause of a military 
helicopter crash over the weekend in South Korea, officials released the names 
Tuesday of the 19 men who died in the fiery accident, most of them Marines from 
Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators remain unsure what caused the CH -- 53D Sea Stallion to go down 
at 10:50 a.m. Sunday (PST) in a dry riverbed while preparing to drop off 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in finding a cause as quickly as we can," said Capt. Laurie 
Pratt, a Marine spokeswoman in Washington. "But it's very common that these 
investigations can take some time." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at Camp Pendleton, meanwhile, were busy preparing for a 
Thursday-morning memorial service for the 16 Marines from the sprawling base 
north of Oceanside who died in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The dead also included the pilot and co-pilot of the Tustin-based helicopter 
and a Navy medical corpsman, whose identity was withheld pending notification 
of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Marines survived the crash, two of them crewmen on the helicopter and 
the rest from Camp Pendleton. Nine of the survivors suffered serious injuries 
and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Camp Pendleton Marines aboard the downed helicopter were from C 
Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. The 
battalion, more than 800 men strong, left Camp Pendleton last month for a 
six-month deployment in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred during a joint military exercise involving more than 200,000 
U.S. and South Korean troops. Dubbed Team Spirit, the exercise is an annual 
test for the two countries and is scheduled to end Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say witnesses reported that the troop transport helicopter fell to 
the ground with no collision with other aircraft or sign of engine trouble. 
Night goggles, which have been blamed for several recent military helicopter 
crashes, were not at issue because the accident occurred in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copter in Crash Has Dubious Past 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Stallion has had a troubled history of military use. In 1987, the 
entire fleet of more than 90 helicopters was grounded for about a month because 
of concerns about the craft's air safety. Despite the latest crash of copter, 
which is manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft Co. of Stratford, Conn., senior 
military officers have said they will not ground the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dead Marines are the pilot, Capt. Michael McGreevy, 27, of Monmouth, 
N.J., and the co-pilot, 1st Lt. David M. Pimple, 25, of Cochise, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton Marines who perished were identified as 1st Lt. Kevin M. Wooten, 
27, of Bowie, Md.; 2nd Lt. Darren M. Bell, 23, of Tampa, Fla.; Staff Sgt. Jorge 
Verdugo, 27, of Nogales, Ariz.; Sgt. James D. Zinser, 30, of Portland, Ore.;

<P>
The injured included helicopter crewmen Cpl. David W. Garlick, 22, of 
Connellsville, Pa. and Sgt. Timothy D. Sabel, 23, of Ripon, Wis. 
</P>
<P>

WOODLAND HILLS NEIGHBORS FAVORED DEMOLITION; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. ORDERS BUILDER TO TRIM HILLTOP CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Woodland Hills builder was ordered Tuesday to lower the height of a 
controversial hilltop condominium project above a 30-year-old neighborhood of 
single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles officials refused to order the entire $7.5-million townhouse 
structure torn down, as nearby residents have demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from the city's Department of Building and Safety said two lofts 
atop the 24-unit West Hills Condominiums project must be trimmed by about two 
feet to meet a 45-foot height limit imposed on the project 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Once those changes are made, the development should meet all city standards, 
said Robert Kline, the city's principal commercial property inspector for the 
Ventura Boulevard area. 
</P>
<P>
"There shouldn't be any other problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials brushed aside complaints by homeowners that the project is 
illegal because it violates building setback requirements set by the City 
Council when the development was first approved for construction in three 
phases in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, residents charged that the project violated a city requirement that 
the third and final building of the project be separated from the site's 
southern property line by a 134-foot landscaped buffer zone. 
</P>
<P>
Developers Ed Dade and James R. Gary had pledged to plant mature evergreen 
trees in the buffer zone to screen the building from the view of nearby 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Line 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners complained that a 121-foot-long section of the building fails to 
meet the setback requirement because of a slight jog in the property line at 
its southeast corner, however. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, officials concluded that the setback requirement is being met 
because the townhouse structure is 134 feet "from the most southerly line" -- a 
point at the southwest corner of the property line, said Cindy Miscikowski, 
chief deputy to Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the Woodland Hills 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"The Planning Department looked at three sets of plans dating back 10 years and 
said it complies," Miscikowski said. She said the issue will be reviewed in 
public "if the community wants to appeal it or discuss it, and I think they 
may." 
</P>
<P>
Sid Perry, a leader of a group of homeowners protesting the project, said he 
and his neighbors plan to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made at least a breakthrough, but the whole neighborhood is up in arms. 
We feel we've been handed a carrot," he said. "We're not satisfied with what we 
see here. We think the city's trying to stonewall us." 
</P>
<P>
Perry said residents still believe that the development rises more than 45 feet 
from the natural grade of the hilltop. And they dispute the city's 
interpretation of the way the setback should be measured.

BERNARDI SAYS HE WILL TAKE PART IN FORUM WITH FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sign that he is facing his toughest race, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi took the unusual step Tuesday of agreeing to face his 
challengers in a public forum. 
</P>
<P>
Council members traditionally have ducked candidate forums because such events 
tend to give challengers an opportunity to gang up on the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
But Bernardi, 77, is in a largely new northeast San Fernando Valley district 
because of the 1986 council redistricting. He is opposed by seven challengers, 
the most in his 28-year council career, in the April 11 election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is in a tough race," said Steve Afriat, a veteran City Hall 
political consultant. "There is a large number of constituents who are 
unfamiliar with him because of reapportionment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned About Attacks 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he was concerned about opponents attacking him for refusing to 
appear with them. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have charged that Bernardi is afraid to meet them. The councilman 
denied that, saying he has avoided forums so far because they have been 
sponsored by his foes. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi laid down some stiff terms, including refusing to answer questions 
from the audience and insisting that he be permitted to speak last. He said he 
would meet his challengers only once and would not participate in a debate 
format, but would answer questions asked by a panel that he felt was impartial. 
He also said the forum must be sponsored by what he considers an impartial 
group, such as the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can debate with seven people," he said at a news conference 
in his City Hall office. "How can you debate when I'm the target?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only interested in discussing the issues," he said. "All they're doing is 
criticizing me without saying what they would do different." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bernardi's opponents said they welcomed a chance to confront him before 
an audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the issues with him," said Lyle 
Hall, a labor-backed city firefighter and potentially Bernardi's toughest 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, former president of the Los Angeles firefighters' union, said he did not 
care what conditions Bernardi put on the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not put any conditions on any of the appearances that I have made," he 
said. "I walked into what was viewed as potentially unfriendly territory, but I 
felt that's the system. . . . The purpose of having a candidates forum is so 
the public can ask questions and talk about items of concern to them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That's No Surprise' 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Jules Bagneris III, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners 
Assn., said Bernardi "has been last on showing leadership on a number of 
issues, so if he wants to be last at a debate, that's no surprise. I don't care 
if he goes first, if he goes in the middle or if he goes last. I will be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But challenger Irene Tovar said: "I think it is an insult for me to participate 
in something that doesn't allow the public to ask questions." 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking for their votes," Tovar said. "How dare we tell them they have 
no right to ask questions."

HOMEOWNERS VETO PAYING FOR SOUND WALL IN TOLUCA LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toluca Lake residents who have been clamoring for a Ventura Freeway sound wall 
have resoundingly voted against paying for it themselves, Los Angeles officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The project had been viewed as a potential precedent-setter. Several other 
neighborhoods are considering paying for their own noise-deadening walls. 
</P>
<P>
But City Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area, said Tuesday that 
the mail vote of 104 to 78 against the resident-financed wall "is the end of it 
as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Residents along the north side of the freeway between Clybourn Avenue and 
Cahuenga Boulevard would have been assessed from $4,000 to $24,000 each for the 
$2.1-million project. Assessments were based on distance from the freeway and 
the size of each parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Had they gone ahead with the project, the state Department of Transportation 
eventually would have reimbursed them. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has designated the 3/4-mile-long stretch of freeway in Toluca Lake as 
qualifying for a sound wall paid for by the state, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But 220 other neighborhoods in the state also meet minimum standards for sound 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhoods are ranked according to the severity of the noise, the cost of 
building a particular wall, the projected noise decrease and the number of 
homes affected. 
</P>
<P>
At the present rate of construction, the Toluca Lake wall would be built in 15 
to 20 years, according to Caltrans engineer William Minter. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that Caltrans reimburse cities or residents that build a 
wall once the project reaches the top of the state priority list. 
</P>
<P>
Although the assessments could have been paid over 15 years, many residents 
complained at a recent neighborhood meeting that they lived on fixed incomes 
and could not afford the payments. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Farias of the city Public Works Department, which conducted the poll, said 
some residents were concerned that the assessment lien would make it difficult 
to refinance their properties. 
</P>
<P>
"But the main feeling I got is that they feel the state should pay for it," 
Farias said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 206 residents who would have been within the assessment district, 182 -- 
or 88% -- cast ballots.

TWO BODIES FOUND IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The body of a heavily tattooed man was found Tuesday in bushes near the Osborne 
Street on-ramp to the northbound Golden State Freeway, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were also trying to learn the identity of a shooting victim whose body 
was found near a railroad right of way in North Hollywood on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The man found along the freeway -- who was about 25 years old, 5 feet, 11 
inches tall and slightly built -- appeared to have been struck on the upper 
torso, said Detective Albert Ferrand. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said the man was killed "either at the hands of another or by a 
vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
The man had a depiction of the crucifixion of Christ, complete with figures of 
onlookers at the base of the cross, tattooed across most of his upper back, 
Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
The man had brown hair, brown eyes and was wearing a white T-shirt and gray 
sweat pants, Ferrand said. The body had been in the bushes between 24 and 48 
hours, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office has scheduled an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's investigators are also attempting to identify a man -- who appeared 
to be between 25 and 35 years old -- who died from a gunshot to the head Friday 
night or early Saturday, said Detective Paul Stewart. An employee of a nearby 
business discovered the body in an industrial area in the 12500 block of Raymer 
Street, near the Southern Pacific tracks, Stewart said.

SAN FERNANDO RESTRICTS DEVELOPMENT ON STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Future development on a main street through San Fernando's oldest Latino 
neighborhood will be restricted to houses and small apartment complexes under a 
new zoning ordinance approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-block stretch of Kalisher Street, between O'Melveny and Coronel 
streets, had been zoned for commercial buildings, which was inconsistent with 
the city's general plan for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city revised the general plan, a blueprint for community 
development, and stipulated that Kalisher Street retain its predominantly 
residential uses. 
</P>
<P>
The council's approval in a 4-1 vote Monday brought the zoning and general plan 
into agreement, which is mandated under state law. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred residents had signed a petition in favor of the new residential 
zoning, which affects about 50 properties, said City Administrator Donald E. 
Penman. But property owners sent letters of protest to the council, saying that 
a zoning change would reduce their property values because it would make their 
land less attractive to buyers, Penman said. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 small businesses, including a bakery, a beauty shop and a convenience 
store, line the street. But most of the structures are houses and small 
apartments.

2 ROB NORTHRIDGE STORE OF $132,000 IN JEWELRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men armed with a pistol and a sledgehammer stole $132,000 in jewelry from a 
Northridge discount store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, who remained at large, entered the Best Products store at 19358 
Nordhoff St. about 8:30 p.m. Monday, ordered a clerk to open a display case and 
emptied the jewelry into a pillowcase before speeding away in stolen 1979 
Buick, according to Los Angeles Police Detective Damon Loomis. The car was 
found abandoned several blocks away minutes later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were picked up by a second car that was driven by a third suspect, who 
also has not been apprehended, Loomis said.

SCHOOL DEFENDS TV EXPERIMENT 
</P>

<P>
Students at Gahr High School wonder what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
Every school-day morning since March 6, students at the Cerritos high school 
have been watching a new teen-oriented TV news broadcast called Channel One, 
produced by Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn. Each 12-minute program, 
being aired on an experimental basis in classrooms at six high schools 
throughout the United States, includes two minutes of commercials for jeans, 
chewing gum and other products that young people buy. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for showing the current-events program, Gahr and each of the other 
schools received $50,000 worth of electronic equipment, including 25-inch color 
televisions for every classroom, two videocassette recorders and a satellite 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Condemned 
</P>
<P>
Because of the commercials on Channel One, however, the program has been 
condemned by the National Education Assn., the American Federation of Teachers, 
and both the California and the National Parent-Teachers Assns., among others. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, National PTA President Manya Ungar of Chicago said the 
group's leaders "applaud efforts to bring new technology into our schools. 
However, we are opposed to making the availability of that technology and 
programming contingent upon subjecting a captive student audience to the 
promotion of commercial products or services." 
</P>
<P>
But at Gahr, the only school in the West taking part in the pilot program, 
students and staff seem surprised at what many see as much ado about Whittle. 
</P>
<P>
Gahr Principal Nadine Barreto, who accepted the firm's invitation to take part 
in the pilot program, acknowledged that she had some initial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle promised Barreto and other participating principals that all 
commercials would be appropriate for classroom viewing. No ads would be 
accepted for alcoholic beverages, tobacco, contraceptives or feminine hygiene 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Principals have the option of screening each program in advance and pulling the 
plug if they find it objectionable. Gahr students have seen all the programming 
to date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Misgivings Allayed 
</P>
<P>
Barreto said her misgivings were also allayed by the quality of the programming 
and the fact that Gahr teachers are using the show to analyze the techniques 
advertisers use to sway audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she noted, $50,000 worth of equipment is not easy to come by in an 
era of Spartan school budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lived in a perfect world, we wouldn't have commercials," she said. "And 
education would be the country's highest priority." 
</P>
<P>
Barreto said she believes that high school students are smarter, more 
sophisticated consumers than critics of the program give them credit for. 
</P>
<P>
Several Gahr students said they are more likely to be influenced by peer 
pressure than by advertising in deciding what to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are walking commercials," teacher Roger Hughes said, alluding to 
the brand names prominently displayed on T-shirts, jeans and running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Wednesday morning, the Channel One broadcast featured stories on 
the national ban on fruit from Chile and the growing concern about the safety 
of apples. 
</P>
<P>
A segment on air pollution touched on everything from acid rain to a Channel 
One reporter's observation that "every time a cow belches, it sends out methane 
gas." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' students laughed at the notion of bovine pollution, but not as hard as 
they laughed at a deodorant commercial that showed a classroom of students with 
dry underarms waving their hands in the air as a voice urged them to "Raise 
your hand if you're Sure!"

VALLEY HOLDS OFF IMPROVING MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Granted, none of Valley College's top-of-the-line pitchers took the mound 
Tuesday. And yes, a few Monarch regulars did sit out the nonconference baseball 
game against Mission. 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy, therefore, to call Mission's 11-7 loss to Valley just one 
more in what has historically been a self-fulfilling prophecy of defeat for the 
Free Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
It also would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its 5-13 overall record, Mission is experiencing the beginning of a 
turnaround under first-year Coach John Klitsner, who took Sylmar High to the 
City Section playoffs in all six years he was head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Klitsner, 37, knew what he was up against when he replaced Lee Fisher as coach 
of the beleaguered program last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Mission, unlike neighboring Valley, Pierce and College of the Canyons, does not 
have a campus baseball facility on its San Fernando campus. The Free Spirit 
practices at Bluebird Field in Sun Valley and plays home games at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Klitsner's main selling point to potential recruits is simply the opportunity 
to play junior college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the goals for this season is to get some respect for this program," 
Klitsner said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp, new pin-striped uniforms have taken care of outward appearances. 
However, it has been the Mission players' performance and attitude, despite the 
team's record, that has convinced opponents that a game against the Free Spirit 
does not necessarily mean a free victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mission is only one win shy of last season's total (six) under Fisher. And the 
Free Spirit, at 3-4 in the Southern California Athletic Conference, is still in 
contention for its first playoff appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we lose, we've gotten respect," said Mission center fielder Art 
Monreal, who had one hit Tuesday and is 12 for 23 in the past six games. 
"People say, 'Hey, those guys have been in our face the whole game. They never 
gave up.' " 
</P>
<P>
That was the case Tuesday as Valley -- with the aid of two misplayed fly balls 
by Mission outfielders -- put together a six-run second inning that helped give 
the Monarchs a 9-0 lead after three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mission held Valley to two runs the rest of the way. The Free Spirit rallied 
for one run in the fourth, two in the fifth, one in the seventh and three in 
the eighth before Valley reliever Mike Roberts retired the side in order in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw John Klitsner do some very good things at Sylmar High, sometimes without 
a whole lot of talent," said Valley Coach Chris Johnson, whose team improved to 
18-3-1. "I knew the Mission program would get turned around. Heck, it is turned 
around. That's another guy who's going to be recruiting the same kids we are. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a little tough for John because Canyons is Canyons and we're 
a little bit established now. But from a coaching standpoint he's got it 
going."

SAUGUS EDGES HOOVER, 4-3, IN TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saugus High baserunner Tom Burges scored from second base on an error with two 
out in the bottom of the seventh inning Tuesday to give the Centurions a 4-3 
victory over Hoover in the championship game of the Glendale tournament at 
Casey Stengel Field. 
</P>
<P>
Burges walked to begin the inning and advanced on Darrell Davis' sacrifice bunt 
down the first-base line. He scored when Hoover shortstop Adam Denne mishandled 
cleanup hitter J. B. Johnson's ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus scored first when Johnson singled home Davis in the first inning. Davis 
was hit by a Paul Derrick pitch before stealing second. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover retaliated in the fourth with consecutive doubles by David Berkey and 
Adam Wiggins. With one out, Mickey Moreno walked and advanced to third on 
Berkey's shot to center field. Both runners scored when Wiggins pulled Scott 
Warr's two-and-one pitch down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
The Tornadoes, though, still had plenty of chances in the inning to increase 
their advantage. Designated-hitter Bryan Day walked and Eric Asselin singled to 
load the bases. But Denne struck out and Reggie Mercado flied out to center. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover's lead was short-lived, however, as Saugus (7-2-1) scored two runs in 
the fourth inning to take the lead, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the inning, Roger Salkeld was safe at first when his grounder to third went 
through the legs of Jose Robles. Warr walked and Jeff Albert, pinch-hitting for 
Trevor Rice, bunted for a single to load the bases. Salkeld scored on a 
fielder's choice and Warr scored on Burges' sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover (7-1) tied the score, 3-3, when Moreno hit homered to right. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get any better ballgame than that," Hoover Coach Bob Cooper said. 
"It's a terrible way to lose a ballgame but a great way to win one."

In other baseball games: 
</P>
<P>
Monroe 6, Reseda 6 (forfeit) -- Reseda forfeited the game when pitcher Tony 
Valdez faked an injury in the bottom of the eighth inning of the Mid-Valley 
League contest at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
According to Monroe Coach Kevin Campbell, Reseda Coach Steve Stone did not want 
Valdez to pitch in the eighth inning, but Valdez had taken his warm-up pitches 
and was therefore required to pitch to at least one batter. 
</P>
<P>
Upon throwing his first pitch to Ernie Echeveste, Valdez fell to the ground 
holding his ankle. At that point, the umpire called the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The umpire saw what happened, said Reseda forfeited the game and was gone," 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe's Henry Valdez had tripled in two runs with two out in the bottom of the 
seventh to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 7, Canoga Park 3 -- The Toreadors exploded for four runs in the fourth 
inning to break open a close contest in the West Valley League game at Lanark 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Shapiro led off the game with a single, extending his hitting streak to 
eight games. Taft (6-2, 3-0) won its third game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 19, Granada Hills 7 -- Mike Murray hit a three-run home run and walked 
five times for Kennedy in the North Valley League game at Granada Hills. Four 
Granada Hills pitchers gave up 15 walks and 15 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Anderson paced the Golden Cougars with four hits and four runs batted 
in. Travis Bourne and Pat DeBoer each had two hits and three RBIs for Kennedy 
(6-2, 2-1), which scored in every inning except the first. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys 7, Birmingham 1 -- Lorenzo Morales had a double and a triple and 
scored three runs, and Mike Engler added a three-run home run for Van Nuys in 
the Mid-Valley League game at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Mowry doubled for the Braves' only extra-base hit. Van Nuys won its third 
consecutive league game without a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Grant 11, Sylmar 0 -- Javier Delahoya, who struck out seven and limited Sylmar 
to four hits, hit a three-run home run in the fifth in the Valley Pac-8 League 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Simon contributed to the six-run fifth by hitting a bases-loaded double. 
Jeff Boardo hit a double and single. 
</P>
<P>
Poly 17, North Hollywood 2 -- Adulfo Hernandez hit a triple and a three-run 
home run and had five RBIs to pace the Parrots in an East Valley League game at 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Chavez had five RBIs and Harold Whiteside hit a three-run home run. David 
Giatti (2-0) struck out eight.

STATWATCH: SIMI VALLEY BATS ALREADY IN FULL SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley has stormed to a 10-1 start, battering opponents in the process. 
The Pioneers are averaging nearly 10 runs a game and are batting .376 as a team 
after Tuesday's 20-1 rout of Sunnyvale Fremont in the Serra tournament in San 
Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
Five Pioneers have scored at least 10 runs, including leadoff batter Jesse 
Anguiano, who has scored 21. And five players have driven in at least eight 
runs, led by Andy Hodgins with 14. 
</P>
<P>
Anguiano is the team's leading hitter with a .531 batting average and Terry 
Hill is batting .515. Hodgins (.452), Chadd Johnson (.429) and Greg Santos 
(.414) also have started fast. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching: The only players as hot as the Simi Valley hitters are the team's 
pitchers. Rich Langford pitched his second three-hit shutout in four days when 
he beat Serra, 9-0, Monday. The 6-foot-4, senior right-hander struck out nine 
and walked four. He also raised his record to 5-0, extended his scoreless 
streak to 16 2/3 innings and lowered his earned-run average to 0.45. 
</P>
<P>
As a team, Simi Valley has allowed 17 earned runs in 77 innings for a 1.55 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth has two potent pitchers in Derek Wallace (4-0), a senior 
right-hander, and Reed McMackin (2-0), a junior right-hander. Wallace has 
struck out 32 in 26 innings and allowed his first two earned runs Tuesday 
against El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin has 22 strikeouts in 19 innings and a 1.91 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Batting: Chatsworth senior center fielder Kevin Chong is batting .556 (15 for 
27) with a home run and eight runs batted in. Chong has scored a team-high 14 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth is averaging 10.5 runs a game and has outscored the opposition, 
84-27. The Chancellors have hit 11 home runs in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Five Newbury Park players have reached double figures in RBIs after only 12 
games. They are: Geoff Black (15), Wayne Cook (14), Eric Greene (13), Danny 
Madsen (12) and Brian Smith (10). 
</P>
<P>
Jason Shapiro has hit safely in all eight of Taft's games. Taft (6-2) is off to 
a 3-0 start in the West Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Westlake is 4-5 after winning its first two games. Much of the blame 
for the slide rests with the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have committed 29 errors and have made at least five in three 
different games. In one five-game span, Westlake made 27 errors. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Warriors are 3-1 in games in which they committed less than 
three errors.

Chana Perry went hard to the basket at practice Monday morning, which is about 
they only good news the San Diego State women's basketball team has had lately. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were preparing for a trip they wish they weren't making, one they 
never even thought of making. 
</P>
<P>
There was little doubt in the minds of the staff and players that the Aztecs 
would be making an appearance in a postseason tournament. The only problem is 
that they were thinking NCAA, not WNIT. 
</P>
<P>
But the Women's National Invitation Tournament in Amarillo, Tex., is exactly 
where the Aztecs (24-8) are headed after losing five of their past seven, 
including a first-round game to Fullerton in the Big West Conference 
tournament. SDSU is top-seeded in the 21st WNIT and will play No. 8 Radford 
(23-6) Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Even the honor of being seeded No. 1 does not necessarily mean good things. The 
top-seeded team has lost in the first round of the WNIT the past three years. 
Nevada Las Vegas of the Big West was last year's victim, losing to Illinois 
State, 73-70.

While Perry (who shared Big West player of the year honors with Penny Toler of 
Cal State Long Beach for the second consecutive year) and shooting guard Julie 
Evans try to heal physically, Coach Earnest Riggins is trying to heal the team 
mentally. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, that's the main thing we have to work on and focus on is playing 
better mentally," said Riggins. "Physically, I think we're there, everything is 
in place. The last seven ballgames we went out on the floor and tried to keep 
from losing instead of going out to win." 
</P>
<P>
Losing is what the Aztecs did, and at the most inopportune time of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the first of two games with Long Beach on Jan. 19, the Aztecs were 
14-0 and ranked No. 12 in the country, best in the program's history. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs' 99-80 loss to the 49ers was not nearly as ominous as the pain that 
began affecting Perry, who had been battling soreness in her right Achilles' 
tendon most of the season. Finally, it took its toll on Perry and the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who finished the season averaging 23.3 points and 13.1 rebounds, played 
off and on until Jan. 30, when her leg was put in a cast until Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
When Long Beach came to San Diego Feb. 18, Perry, who had been unable to 
practice, was noticeably ineffective. She couldn't move the ball upcourt or 
drive to the basket. The Aztecs lost, 91-80, in a game that was not even that 
close. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU followed with a loss to Fullerton and dropped out of the top 20 for the 
first time. The low point came when the Aztecs traveled to play Pacific, which 
was sitting near the bottom of the Big West standings, and were routed, 85-68. 
</P>
<P>
That dropped the Aztecs from second to fifth in the Big West and meant they had 
to play Fullerton, instead of UC Santa Barbara, in the first round of the 
conference tournament. They had beaten Santa Barbara twice during the regular 
season by a combined 44 points. 
</P>
<P>
"The injury to Chana did something to us," Riggins said. "She's a dominant 
player, but her leadership ability comes in performance, and the other kids 
follow. We were hoping that eventually we could get the pieces back together, 
but I think we never recovered from that." 
</P>
<P>
If adversity makes a team stronger, then the Aztecs should be ready for the 
WNIT. But Perry is still feeling pain, and Evans has reinjured a troublesome 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we didn't enjoy," Riggins said. "We know where we should have 
been, where we could have been and where we would have been. 
</P>
<P>
"With all those things in mind it really hits hard." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Radford is is led by 5-foot-5 guard Stephanie Howard, who is averaging 20.2 
points, 6.5 assists and 5.8 rebounds. The Highlanders went 12-0 and won the Big 
South Conference regular-season title, but lost to Campbell in the Big South 
tournament final to decide the conference's automatic qualifier to the NCAA 
tournament. . . . DePaul (22-8) is seeded fourth and is the first team to 
defend its WNIT title in 16 years. . . . The Aztecs have played just one of the 
seven teams in the field this season. SDSU defeated sixth-seeded Murray State 
(21-8), 81-58, January 2 in San Diego. . . . Other teams competing in the 
tournament are second-seeded Toledo (23-7), third-seeded Richmond (24-6), 
fifth-seeded Oregon (19-10) and seventh-seeded Notre Dame (20-9).

Accompanying the listing for Yes in the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock 'n' 
Roll is a photograph showing the British progressive-rock band's best-known 
incarnation: singer Jon Anderson, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboard player Rick 
Wakeman, drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Chris Squire. 
</P>
<P>
It was this lineup that recorded Yes' two highest-charting albums, 1971's 
"Fragile" and 1972's "Close to the Edge." Moreover, it was this lineup that was 
primarily responsible for developing the group's elaborate, neoclassical sound, 
of which Anderson's ethereal soprano was, perhaps, the most identifiable 
aspect. 
</P>
<P>
But when this fabled troupe, sans Squire, appears in San Diego sometime this 
fall, it won't be as Yes. Even though Squire's contributions to the group he 
and Anderson founded in 1968 were minimal -- bass players, after all, are a 
dime (a quarter, with inflation) a dozen -- he's continued to tour and record 
under the Yes moniker long after the others dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
And today, legal rights to the group's name belong to Squire and Squire alone 
-- and not to the band of former Yesmen led by Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Local concert promoter Bill Silva, who is negotiating with the other Yes for 
its upcoming San Diego date, discovered this last week in a letter from the Los 
Angeles law firm of Rintala, Smoot, Jaenicke &amp; Brunswick, which represents 
Squire's Yes. Stating that "my clients are acknowledged to be the owners of the 
trade name 'Yes,' " attorney William T. Rintala warned Silva "that any use of 
'Yes' . . . in such things as posters, advertisements or promotions which 
suggests or implies that the Anderson, Howe, Wakeman (and Bruford) group is 
'Yes' would violate my clients' rights and would require my clients to take 
steps to protect those rights." 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent telephone interview, Rintala told The Times that his chief 
concern is that the public might be confused "about which act is appearing." 
</P>
<P>
"The Chris Squire group owns the name, and, while we don't mind the other group 
making historical statements about their past, we don't want them emphasizing 
the Yes name in a manner that would infringe on trademark law," Rintala said. 
</P>
<P>
Silva's solution: The local appearance by Anderson, Howe, Wakeman and Bruford, 
tentatively scheduled for October, will be billed as "An Evening of Yes Music." 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to find a happy medium that will satisfy both parties," Silva 
said. "We want to say yes to Yes, whoever Yes is." 
</P>
<P>
For young people who prefer their eggs chocolate and wrapped in foil, the 
upcoming San Diego Soviet Arts Festival holds little appeal. But, if Phil Quinn 
has his way, the youth of San Diego will get to sample a taste of Russian 
culture more to their liking: He's hoping to present one or two Soviet rock 
bands, in concert at the San Diego Sports Arena, sometime during the festival's 
three-week run. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a lot of inroads with Russian officials when we did the Moscow Circus" 
last December, said Quinn, the arena's executive vice president and general 
manager, "and we're hoping we can take advantage of those connections in 
bringing one or two of the most popular Soviet rock bands over here during the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're talking about a specific age group here that (the festival 
organizers) maybe don't have anything for, and this would be the perfect thing 
to give young people a feeling of involvement, to bring the culture of Russia 
to them in a way they can relate." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Herring, executive director of San Diego Festivals Inc., which is 
producing the Oct. 21-Nov. 11 Soviet Arts Festival, was noncommittal when asked 
whether he would like to get involved with Quinn's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already exploring some contemporary music ideas of our own," Herring 
said. "This is the first I've heard of their proposal, and I'd like to hear 
more about it before I comment." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: "(619) 239-KING" is the first single off Mojo Nixon and Skid 
Roper's new Enigma Records album, "Root Hog or Die." The tune is a follow-up to 
1987's "Elvis Is Everywhere," the local duo's uproarious debunking of the Elvis 
Presley mystique that garnered manic-talkin' blues man Nixon and his 
washboard-strummin' sidekick a fair amount of commercial radio airplay 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his long absence from the pop charts, crooner Neil Diamond had no 
trouble selling out his April 17 and 18 appearances at the San Diego Sports 
Arena. So a third arena date has been added: April 19. Tickets went on sale 
Monday. . . . Tickets go on sale today for industrial dance-rock band Nitzer 
Ebb's April 11 concert at the Soma 555 dance club downtown. . . . The latest 
booking in the 13th annual concert series at San Diego State University's Open 
Air Theater is reggae singer Bunny Wailer on April 15.

"Cosimo De'Medici" by Pontormo will be auctioned at Christie's in New York on 
May 31, one of the most important Old Master paintings sold in the last 30 
years. The Italian Renaissance painting, depicting the young Cosimo with 
halberd in hand, had been on loan to the New York Frick Collection for 19 
years. Frick President Charles A. Ryskamp told the New York Times that he is 
devastated by the decision to sell, adding that "the Frick is determined to do 
what we can to save that painting for our collection." Chauncey Cevereaux 
Stillman, a New York investor and philanthropist who owned the painting, died 
Jan. 24. The painting subsequently was removed by his lawyers who said it would 
be sold for the benefit of the Homeland Foundation, Stillman's charitable 
organization. The painting is expected to sell for more than $20 million.

The U.S. government must pay more than $146,000 in lawyers' fees to the widow 
of Chilean President Salvador Allende because she was wrongly denied a visa to 
visit the United States six years ago, a federal judge in Boston ruled. 
Hortensia de Allende, whose Marxist husband was killed in a 1973 coup, was 
invited in 1983 to speak to several American universities but was denied a 
non-immigrant tourist visa by then-Undersecretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger. Allende challenged the State Department decision and later sought 
attorneys' fees under the 1980 Equal Access to Justice Act.

Iran has agreed to military contracts and large weapons purchases from East 
Bloc countries in rejection of Western political and economic pressures, 
Reuters news agency said, quoting unnamed Iranian sources. The sources said 
that Czechoslovakia will supply about 180 Soviet T-54/55 tanks that it makes 
under license and build a factory in Esfahan to produce anti-tank and 
anti-aircraft missiles. Romania is helping modernize a tractor factory in Arak, 
southwest of Tehran, to produce armored vehicles, they said, adding that 
construction by Romania of a new naval base on Qeshm island in the Strait of 
Hormuz is under discussion.

A Czechoslovak appeals court cut a month from dissident Vaclav Havel's 
nine-month jail sentence. Havel, 52, a co-founder of the Charter 77 human 
rights movement, was arrested Jan. 16 when he sought to mark the 20th 
anniversary of a student's suicide-protest against the 1968 Soviet-led invasion 
of Czechoslovakia. The appeals court, while confirming Havel's Feb. 21 
conviction on an incitement charge, also ordered him transferred to a prison 
with less harsh conditions than those normally ordered for repeat offenders. 
About 200 of Havel's supporters paraded outside the courtroom calling for his 
freedom. Havel called the sentence "an act of revenge for my opinions."

U.S. Customs agents in Honolulu seized a research vessel owned by the Navy and 
operated by the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and arrested a crew member 
from San Diego after a search turned up a small amount of marijuana on board, 
authorities said. The search of the 196-foot ship, the Thomas Washington, 
turned up 4.5 grams of marijuana hidden in a crewman's berth, Customs officials 
said. The crewman, Kenneth G. Racca Jr., faces charges of importation and 
possession of a controlled substance, authorities said. The ship, the 
institute's second largest research vessel, docked at Honolulu Harbor after a 
trip to American Samoa. It left San Diego nearly a year ago for research in the 
Pacific. Officials said the ship could be returned to La Jolla-based Scripps 
after an administrative petitioning process and payment of a fine.

Former South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan has agreed to testify before 
Parliament next month on the alleged abuses of his government, a key demand of 
the opposition, the Joongang Ilbo newspaper said. The report after President 
Roh Tae Woo announced he was postponing plans to hold a referendum on his 
policies in an apparent bid to avoid a confrontation with the opposition over 
Chun's authoritarian legacy. Kim Yoon Whan, National Assembly floor leader for 
the ruling Democratic Justice Party, conferred with Chun last Friday and asked 
for his testimony, the newspaper said. "It was learned that Chun agreed to do 
anything that can help" Roh, the newspaper said.

A House subcommittee unanimously recommended impeachment of convicted federal 
Judge Walter Nixon, accusing him of undermining the integrity of the judiciary. 
The full Judiciary Committee will now decide whether to place the three 
articles before the House for a vote. Nixon, who is serving a five-year perjury 
sentence, will remain a federal judge and continue to collect his $89,500 
salary unless impeached by the House and then tried and convicted by the 
Senate. He has maintained his innocence but was convicted in 1986 of lying to a 
grand jury about his knowledge of drug charges against the son of Mississippi 
millionaire Wiley Fairchild and his efforts to intervene in the case.

The Nobel Foundation raised the cash award for Nobel prizes by 20% to $473,000. 
The increase was set after a second record year of profits by the foundation 
that administers the fortune Alfred Nobel bequeathed in 1896. The foundation 
said that profits surged by 71% last year to $9.1 million. A year ago, the 
value of the prizes were raised by 15% to $416,000.

The Internal Revenue Service has abandoned a policy under which employees were 
told not to notify taxpayers who inadvertently overpaid their income taxes, 
acting Commissioner Michael J. Murphy said. The change was announced after a 
meeting with Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), to whom some employees of the IRS 
service center in Memphis had complained. Those employees said the old policy 
amounted to the IRS's stealing from taxpayers -- most of whom apparently were 
pensioners. In addition to dropping the old policy, Murphy and Gore said, the 
IRS will make provisions for taxpayers who inadvertently overpaid their 1985 
and 1986 taxes to file amended returns.

The oil production platform about 100 miles southeast of New Orleans and an 
adjacent platform connected by a 50-foot catwalk were hit by the explosion 
Sunday.

<P>
Workers for Atlantic Richfield Oil Co., which operated the platforms, boarded 
the fire-scorched rig Tuesday once it was decided it was safe to do so, said 
Arco spokesman Earl Sims.

Forty-two people were aboard the rig when the explosion hit. Of the 35 who 
escaped, 10 were injured.

The nation's math teachers on Tuesday released standards designed to make sure 
pupils learn to explore and reason as well as add, subtract, multiply and 
divide. 
</P>
<P>
"Our children are internationally competitive in ... arithmetical skills," said 
John Dossey, chairman of the standards commission of the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics. "It is in the application of mathematics in geometry, 
measurement and data analysis where our students are falling short." 
</P>
<P>
Dossey, a math professor at Illinois State University, cited studies showing 
basic skills have improved over the past 20 years. "Yet today only about 
one-half of American 17-year-olds can say whether 87 percent of 10 is less than 
10, greater than 10 or equal to 10," or figure out how much carpet is needed to 
cover a floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's curriculum and evaluation standards, a collection of 54 
guidelines for kindergarten through high school, were three years in the making 
and aim to raise the level of applied math skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Applied mathematics is not just for a couple of geniuses in the country," said 
Sally Ride, a Stanford University physicist and former astronaut who appeared 
at a news conference with the math teachers. 
</P>
<P>
She said the new standards should make applied math accessible to all students 
but teachers, parents and students "will have more work to do. The country is 
going to have to make it a higher priority." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the standards seek to ensure that students value math, become 
confident in their abilities, solve problems, and learn to communicate and to 
reason mathematically.

Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) says he witnessed a shooting in the nation's 
capital but sped away without notifying police. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I shouldn't have reported it, but at that one time and place my 
thought was to escape -- get out of there," he was quoted as saying in 
Tuesday's Salem Statesman Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield said he and his family were driving to their Washington home from a 
restaurant last week when they saw a man shoot at another from across a street. 
He said the shooting victim was able to get into a waiting car, which sped off.

IT'S NOT ALWAYS CHEAP OR EASY, BUT A SKYSCRAPER HOME MEANS LESS SMOG AND NO

After working late, lawyers Christian E. Markey Jr. and his wife, Mickey 
Byrnes, often slip into an outdoor Jacuzzi and stare up peacefully at a 
"lighted forest" of skyscrapers looming overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's like Christmas all the time," said Markey, 59, who with his wife 
last year joined a growing cadre of upper-middle-class professionals -- an 
ethnically diverse mix of singles and couples with few or no children at home 
-- who chose to escape into the city after work, rather than from it: 
</P>
<P>
They moved downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Central City Assn. and Community Redevelopment Agency 
estimate that more than 10,000 people now live in downtown Los Angeles -- most 
in subsidized apartments or hotel rooms for the elderly or low-income, and some 
on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
But about 3,000 do so strictly by choice, paying market-price rentals or 
mortgages for the 1,500 apartments and condominiums in complexes on Bunker Hill 
or the 200 in Skyline, the first outpost in the city's long-promised South Park 
development near the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The number of available units has doubled in the 20 years since Bunker Hill 
Towers first opened, and it is expected to double again in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown living is just in its genesis," said Doug Sheldon, 60, who with his 
wife, Dixie, also 60, commutes by elevator from their Bunker Hill Towers 
condominium to the office of Bunker Hill Real Estate Co., which they started as 
a retirement adventure. "We have weathered the storm and are becoming a mature 
downtown community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Solid Foothold 
</P>
<P>
Urban planners agree downtown living has established a solid foothold in Los 
Angeles, but they caution that the roads to downtown will not be clogged with 
moving vans anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, they see a slow, steady migration of middle- and upper-class 
professionals into downtown, defined roughly by the Hollywood and San 
Bernardino freeways, Beaudry Avenue, 12th Street and Olive or Hill streets. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the movement are many factors: increasingly congested freeways, which 
can make commutes an exercise in frustration; a nationwide gentrification 
process encouraged by publicly funded urban-renewal projects; infusion of 
foreign capital, and a determination by the city to create downtown housing for 
upper economic classes to support restaurants and retailers, ease traffic and 
reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
At work, too, is a desire to form an identifiable center in a city seen mainly 
as a monument to suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people felt 20 years ago that we could build a core and we could make 
a lot of money and everyone would have a Los Angeles identity," said Michael 
Dear, USC professor of geography and urban planning. "So Bunker Hill Towers 
(three high-rises with 700 units bounded by 1st, Figueroa, 3rd and Hope 
streets) was built. Since then, we have been creating a downtown." 
</P>
<P>
Planners for the Community Redevelopment Agency -- which guides development in 
certain sectors of the city, including downtown -- eventually want at least 20% 
of the downtown work force to live there. 
</P>
<P>
They envision 10,000 new residential units in Central City West (roughly the 
five blocks on the west side of Harbor Freeway between the Hollywood Freeway 
and Olympic Boulevard) and 10,000 for South Park (9th to 12th and Figueroa to 
Olive Streets). Working with the USC Redevelopment Corp., they hope to create 
middle- and upper-income residences from South Park all the way to USC at 
Exposition Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"For downtown Los Angeles to be the hub of a major world-class city," said Don 
Spivack, CRA director of operations for the Central Business District, "it 
needs to be much more like other world cities, which have a downtown 
residential component. We will have that by the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there is a long way to go. Today only a handful of Los Angeles 
County's 8.4 million residents live downtown, and the proportion never will be 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown residences are small and expensive and have not emerged as terrific 
investments. They offer no back yard, and usually can be reached only by 
elevator. There are panhandlers and those who live downtown share a universal 
quest for economical groceries. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who already have chosen the downtown life style, an era of urban 
pioneering appears to have ended. "It is not a mystery like it used to be. The 
curtain has been lifted," said Leo Benizio, manager of Bunker Hill Towers 
Condominiums, who lives in distant Yorba Linda with his wife, Joyce, former 
manager of Skyline. "I think those who live downtown now know what they have to 
do to survive in an urban environment." 
</P>
<P>
What they must do is drive less and walk more -- to work, to play, and to run 
routine errands -- and they seem to like it. 
</P>
<P>
Most of several dozen downtowners interviewed said they chose their life style 
to avoid what a recent Times Poll of Los Angeles residents identified as the 
No. 2 drain on the city's quality of life: traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"The one single greatest cause for living here," said Sheldon, who moved 
downtown in 1976 to be close to his former job with a real estate investment 
department, "is the convenience and eliminating the commute." 
</P>
<P>
Criminal defense lawyer Michael R. Yamaki, a bachelor, gave up Malibu beach 
life for downtown in 1981: "I had to wake up before the sun got up to get into 
town. Now I can get up at 8, shave, shower and eat breakfast and get into court 
by 9." 
</P>
<P>
Some people like downtown so much they retire there, even when they could 
afford to go elsewhere. Imogene Dewey, 83, moved to Bunker Hill in 1971 after 
retiring as clerk of the Justice Court in Tehachapi. The energetic widow wanted 
access to theaters and childhood friends without learning to drive. 
</P>
<P>
Most downtowners own cars, although many couples cut from two to one and drive 
less than suburban counterparts. When they must drive, they say, they usually 
do so against traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Jesica Baker, 38, a sales representative for a health-care network, commutes 
from downtown throughout Southern California or to visit her office in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Don't you have this backwards?' " she said. "But for me it's 
perfect. And on weekends, I am absolutely enthralled with the idea that I can 
walk to major shopping, to the post office, to the shoe repair, to the Y(MCA), 
to the Music Center, to the movies, even for limited groceries. I can do almost 
anything I want to do or need to do without getting in my car." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urban Benefits 
</P>
<P>
They move for convenience but downtowners have discovered benefits they never 
suspected and suburbanites rarely associate with urban living. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the nicest, quietest, least congested places in Los Angeles on 
the weekends," Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
An unexpected fountain of youth, downtowners say, springs from the increased 
physical activity and reduced mental stress that comes from walking rather than 
driving, and from being in the thick of a city. 
</P>
<P>
"Just walking the downtown streets at noon and watching Los Angeles move toward 
the European life style makes me 20 years younger," said William H. Weber, 68, 
who "retired" to Skyline with his wife, Sue, 63, three years ago, only to help 
start Wilshire Realty Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown residents also boast of a small-town sense of community. "Most of us 
moved to Los Angeles from elsewhere and have no real family here. So we made 
our own family," said Nan Aune, 45, as she received her weekly manicure at a 
Bunker Hill salon. A downtown resident since 1971, Aune drives 35 miles daily 
to teach computer programming at Westminster High School in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
John Hinchliffe, 22, the lunch host at Stepps restaurant in Wells Fargo Center, 
began renting his parents' Bunker Hill condominium last December. He still 
marvels at the reception he received. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the nicest things about living here was moving in here," he said as he 
stopped for a haircut at Jacques Michel Salon. "When we showed up, there was 
someone there to help us -- neighbors!" 
</P>
<P>
Downtowners say they find plenty of things to do in their leisure. Within 
walking distance are two prime athletic facilities, the Music Center, the 
Museum of Contemporary Art, Chinatown, Olvera Street, Little Tokyo, and a small 
but growing gallery of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. on Foot 
</P>
<P>
A favorite pastime is simply to explore downtown on foot. A system of skywalks 
lets pedestrians move throughout much of downtown without setting foot on 
streets outside. 
</P>
<P>
They adopt almost a proprietary interest in new buildings and the subway, 
considering the construction entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"I just walk through downtown every couple of weeks -- about five-six miles -- 
to see what is going on in Chinatown and Little Tokyo and see how the new State 
Building (at Spring and 3rd streets) is doing," said Jim Norton, supervisor of 
travel publications for the Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old bachelor was one of the first to move into Bunker Hill Towers 
when it opened in 1969 and the first to buy a condominium at Skyline when it 
opened in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Downtowners seem to have little trouble finding everyday services and places to 
shop, although some venues -- the garment district for wholesale clothing or 
the flower market where Baker buys two dozen carnations for $4 -- definitely 
are not commonplace. Dry cleaning, haircuts and convenience markets are 
available in residential or office complexes. Clothing and gifts are found in 
major department stores on 7th Street or in 7th Market Place. 
</P>
<P>
The one necessity that's missing, downtowners agree, is a major grocery. While 
they wait for one the CRA promises will be built in South Park by 1991, they 
adjust, paying higher prices at a convenience market in Bunker Hill Towers or 
driving to supermarkets in Little Tokyo or Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerned Parents 
</P>
<P>
For the few young couples concerned, there are concerns, including adequate 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"What's missing for children, besides diapers, are parks and playgrounds, other 
children and space," said Marilyn Wagner, 27, who moved from Washington, D.C., 
two months ago with her husband, lawyer William Wagner, and 5-month-old Nicole. 
They chose a studio rental apartment on Bunker Hill to save money by 
eliminating their car. 
</P>
<P>
"When Nicole is a toddler," she said, "I would rather be in a neighborhood 
where she can be out playing in the yard with other children." 
</P>
<P>
Despite real problems, downtowners seem unfazed by the other perceived perils 
peculiar to their life style -- high cost for little space, crime, earthquakes, 
fire, noise and smog. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments and condominiums are small -- 900 to 1,400square feet for two 
bedrooms and 2,000 square feet for the largest penthouses. In terms of 
square-foot cost, they are pricey. The Sheldons say the low condominium prices 
in the area are $90,000 for studios, $155,000 for a one-bedroom, $275,000 for 
two bedrooms, and around $550,000 for combined units or penthouses. 
</P>
<P>
Rentals in Grand Promenade, the 27-floor, 372-unit complex expected to open 
atop Bunker Hill this spring, range from $775 a month for the lowest studio to 
$2,295 for a top two-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nighttime Strolls 
</P>
<P>
As for safety, downtowners agree they wouldn't walk Main Street at midnight but 
they do feel comfortable strolling to the Music Center or to restaurants after 
dark. They choose routes carefully and are comforted by the security guards in 
residential and office complexes. 
</P>
<P>
And as for earthquakes, the Oct. 1, 1987, temblor, and Oct. 4 aftershock tested 
the mettle of those who live in the downtown high-rises. One 42-year-old 
librarian put his 12th-floor Skyline condominium on the market and moved to 
Pasadena when the aftershock jammed his entry dead bolt, trapping him for five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Renner, 48, a psychologist who lives in one of Los Angeles' four loftiest 
dwellings, a 32nd-floor penthouse at Bunker Hill Towers, was thrown to the 
floor by the quake. Antique furniture fell or skidded, and expensive Chinese 
porcelains shattered. 
</P>
<P>
But she and her husband, Dr. Ian Renner, 50, a gastroenterologist who met at a 
building party and married two years ago, remain downtowners. They bolted their 
furniture to the walls and attached the rest of the porcelain collection to the 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still living here because I learned the reason we swayed so much is that 
the building has a 3-foot displacement," said Elena Renner. "The building 
structure is good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peaceful Sleepers 
</P>
<P>
Downtowners also seem to have little fear of fire, despite the deaths of three 
people in a 1979 fire in West Tower of Bunker Hill Towers. Many point to 
sprinklers or plans for them, and note that the Los Angeles Fire Department has 
a station at 1st and Figueroa streets. 
</P>
<P>
Noise is a problem only to those who haven't learned to sleep through fire 
sirens or hovering helicopters. The Webers, Norton and other Skyline residents 
have even stoically endured night construction cacophony on the adjacent 
Metrorail project because they believe Los Angeles needs a subway. 
</P>
<P>
"We call the traffic noise 'white noise,' " said Elaine S. Stewart, 45, retail 
consultant for Central City Assn., who lives with her husband, Greg, 31, in a 
Carroll Avenue Victorian duplex. "We tell our friends from Oregon that it 
sounds like the Pacific Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Smog is another would-be problem that downtowners rarely worry about. "The air 
is better here than where I used to spend all my time in San Marino," Markey 
said, echoing neighbors who claim that pollution is worse in most other 
desirable residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
offers support for their views. In 1988, he said, downtown had three 
first-stage alerts, when ozone exceeded .20 parts per million and curtailed 
physical activity was advised. By comparison, Reseda in the San Fernando Valley 
had four, Pasadena 19, and Glendora, the worst area in the San Gabriel Valley, 
58. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare Interactions 
</P>
<P>
Most who live downtown rarely interact with Latinos who come in droves on 
weekends to shop and attend movies along Broadway. The downtowners cling to 
higher-priced restaurants or the movie complex and stores in the 
Figueroa-Flower corridor between 1st and 9th streets. Many seem to be unaware 
of the Broadway activity, including the bustling Grand Central Market. 
</P>
<P>
Just as downtowners are divided into low- and high-income groups, they adhere 
to a natural geographic division, with the upscale roaming west of Hill Street 
and their low-income counterparts flocking to shop, eat or entertain themselves 
east of Hill. Sue Laris, publisher of the Downtown News, which downtowners 
embrace as their hometown weekly, can only see her resident readership growing. 
</P>
<P>
"Two things will impel downtown residential housing," she said. "One is that 
traffic is getting worse incrementally, and the other is that the incredible 
price of (suburban) homes, which has shot up dramatically in the last two 
years, is making the square-foot cost of downtown look better." 
</P>
<P>
When her youngest child finishes school in Pasadena, Laris may even move 
downtown herself.

"Satanic Verses" on an installment of "Bookmark," the PBS series about books. 
The program is due to air locally at 9 a.m. Sunday on KCET Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the reading was taped, "Bookmark" also was planning to feature 
Rushdie as a guest to talk about his work. That was before he was forced into 
hiding because of the Ayatollah Khomeini's death order, however. Now the book 
will be discussed without him.

FATAL FIRE: NEIGHBORS CAN ONLY SHAKE HEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Allwrights seemed to be making it. 
</P>
<P>
The family had moved from Culver City two years ago to a nice house on a 
tree-lined street in the heart of affluent Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
They had a live-in housekeeper. And the three children -- twin boys and a 
daughter -- were in private schools. They drove a new van on vacations to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But it all came to a sudden, crashing halt Monday night, when fire raged 
through their ranch-style, split-level home, killing all three children. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Allwright, a commercial real estate broker, and his wife, Patricia, were 
attending night classes and had left the children in the care of the 
housekeeper, who apparently awoke to find the house in flames, according to 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The housekeeper escaped unhurt, but neighbors who ran to help could not reach 
the children inside. Candice, 7, and the 5-year-old boys, Adam and Jason, were 
pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman said Tuesday the blaze erupted when a 
cloth placed over a lamp ignited. He added that the home was not equipped with 
smoke detectors, which could have saved the children. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the maid apparently draped the cloth on the lamp because the 
children did not like to sleep in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimated fire damage at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Several neighbors milled about in front of the blackened home Tuesday, shaking 
their heads, sighing and remembering how devoted the Allwrights were to their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hell of a thing," said Doug Maner, an attorney who lives across the 
street in the 16500 block of Akron Street. "They had bought the cheapest house 
they could afford in the Palisades, scrimped and saved just to get a foothold 
here, and now they're destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
As Maner spoke, a man who would identify himself only as the Allwrights' cousin 
surveyed the gutted house. Children's books, a rocking horse, a go-cart and 
other charred toys were strewn about the back yard. The cousin rescued the 
family cat, which had disappeared after escaping the flames. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the kind of people we used to have as neighbors years ago -- real 
neighbors," said Thomas Thomas, an actor and writer who lives next door. "Very, 
very friendly. And those sweet kids . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything they were doing was for those kids. They were devoted to those 
kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' house was slightly damaged by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street and up the hill, neighbor and friend Myra Kotick said her 
three young children used to play with the Allwright youngsters. The two 
families had moved into the neighborhood at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Consulted 
</P>
<P>
Kotick was making sandwiches on the tiled counter of her kitchen on Tuesday as 
she described the impact of the tragedy on her children. She said she had 
already spoken to a psychologist twice for advice on how to handle the deaths 
and explain them to her children. 
</P>
<P>
The housekeeper, who was sleeping in one of the children's rooms, awoke to find 
the house in flames. Her screams as she ran outside, and the screams of 
passers-by who saw the yellow glow of flames, awoke neighbors who ran to the 
home with hoses. But the would-be rescuers were driven back by the smoke and 
intense heat. 
</P>
<P>
Maner and Adam Urquidez were among the first to reach the house. They crawled 
into a bedroom, looked in a closet and under a bed, hoping to find the 
children. It turned out to be the parents' bedroom, where damage was minor. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they tried to get the housekeeper, who speaks little English, to 
indicate where the children were. And one neighbor, who spoke some Spanish, 
tried to interpret. But the housekeeper, covered in ash, barefoot and in her 
nightgown, was hysterical, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all yelling and screaming. It was such a helpless feeling," Suzanne 
Maner, the attorney's wife, said. "You would think it would be someone who was 
careless with their children that this would happen to. They were the opposite 
of that, so caring." 
</P>
<P>
The section of Pacific Palisades where the Allwrights lived is called Marquez 
Knolls. Its winding streets are lined with comfortable homes, priced well above 
half a million dollars. Many smaller homes are being leveled and replaced by 
larger, more elegant structures. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of their neighbors, the Allwrights were deep into renovating the 
property. Lumber and cans of paint can be seen in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The Allwrights are active parishioners at Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church 
in Pacific Palisades. Msgr. John Mihan, called to the home late Monday night by 
a fire captain, gave the children the last rites. 
</P>
<P>
Mihan said he and Steve and Patricia Allwright prayed together. 
</P>
<P>
"They demonstrated very staunch faith . . . ," the priest said. "We talked of 
the children being in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Candice was a first-grader at the exclusive Wildwood School in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the school, Anne Simon, on Tuesday remembered how the child almost 
always wore a tiara fashioned of tinfoil and loved art and writing stories. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very vivacious, bright and sociable. It's a great family," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
The school activated a "crisis program" Tuesday, Simon said. Parents of 
Candice's classmates were invited to meet with a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers broke the news to students, who spent more than an hour talking about 
their feelings and answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, Simon said, were encouraged to spend the next few nights at home -- to 
allay their children's fears.

HUNDREDS FLEE FIRE IN SHAFT AT HILTON HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIESON HIMMEL and MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the Los Angeles Hilton Hotel early 
Tuesday when a spark from a kitchen stove ignited a fire in a ventilator shaft. 
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 guests were rousted from their top floor rooms about 3:30 a.m. by 
firefighters knocking on doors or by phone calls from hotel operators. Others 
walked outside after smelling smoke or hearing fire helicopters and sirens. 
Nearly all the 900 rooms in the hotel were occupied, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Fire Chief Dave Sloan said a cooking fire about 2:30 a.m. was 
extinguished by the hotel's automatic carbon dioxide extinguishers, but heat 
from the small flame rose in the ventilator shaft and ignited residue and a 
filter in the rooftop fan system. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Claude Creasy said 125 firefighters of 21 companies from San 
Pedro to the San Fernando Valley responded to the call and knocked down the 
fire at 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Guests, including some who fled in their nightclothes, were allowed to return 
to their rooms about 5:25 a.m. and were welcomed with free coffee and rolls in 
the lobby and hotel dining room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kitchen Reopens 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from the Los Angeles County Health Department approved reopening of 
the hotel's first-floor kitchen late Tuesday morning after determining that no 
food had been contaminated by smoke or the firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kirk, hotel general manager, said the fire caused no substantial damage 
because it was confined to the metal ventilator shaft. No general alarm was 
sounded, he said, because the fire was confined and easily extinguished. Had 
the fire spread, he said, sprinklers would have been activated and all alarms 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Evacuation was orderly and without panic, said guests who praised firefighters 
for their handling of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Some guests who left on their own complained, however, that they heard no 
alarms and could not get an answer when they tried calling hotel operators. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably we shouldn't have come down, but if you hear many people scrambling 
down the steps, you tend to follow," said Jutta Kamps, who with her husband, 
Richard, had checked into an 11th floor room for a single "quiet night" between 
flights from their home in Australia to South America. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Miller and Paul Tomes, businessmen from Cincinnati who also had checked 
in for a single night, complained that they had not been notified of the fire 
by the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
They awakened because of jet lag -- at 6:30 a.m. EDT in their own time zone -- 
and smelled smoke. They dressed quickly, grabbed their briefcases and luggage 
and walked down the stairs from a 10th-floor room. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire near our city about 10 years ago 
that killed 165 people, so we want out when there is a fire," said Miller, 
referring to a tragic 1977 fire in Southgate, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is, 'Give us the choice, don't make it for us,' " said Tomes. "We 
started banging on doors on our way out." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Alzamora, a Spanish tourist from Majorca, said he and his family were 
awakened by a helicopter outside their eighth-floor room and decided to 
evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a Hollywood spectacle, like a movie," said his wife, Lalos Zamora, 
in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the evacuees stood docilely in the parking lot at 8th and Figueroa 
streets a block south of the hotel or on the Wilshire Boulevard sidewalk on the 
north side. 
</P>
<P>
Nona Burrell, Huntington, W. Va., sat in the lower lobby doing needlepoint. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like Madame DeFarge," she said, drinking coffee in the main lobby 
before firefighters had given evacuees permission to return to their rooms. She 
referred to the character in Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities" who sat knitting 
as people were beheaded by the guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Vogltanz, Chicago, told himself "to heck with standing in the cold," 
got his car out of the garage with no resistance from attendants, drove a 
couple of blocks away and took a catnap. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Coutee, Fremont, said he stood outside until he got cold and then returned 
to the lobby, by-passing police and security guards by telling them he had to 
go to the bathroom.

BERNARDI SAYS HE WILL FACE FOES IN FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sign that he is facing his toughest race, Los Angeles City Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi took the unusual step Tuesday of agreeing to face his 
challengers in a public forum. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members traditionally duck candidate forums because such events 
tend to give challengers an opportunity to gang up on the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
But the 77-year-old Bernardi is in a largely new northeast San Fernando Valley 
district that was carved out by the City Council in 1986. Compounding his woes, 
seven challengers -- the most of his 28-year political career -- are opposing 
him in the April 11 election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is in a tough race," said Steve Afriat, a veteran City Hall 
political consultant. "There is a large number of constituents who are 
unfamiliar with him because of reapportionment." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he was concerned that his opponents' attacks on him for refusing 
to appear with them might have some impact. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have charged that Bernardi is afraid to face them. The councilman 
denied this and said he had avoided forums so far because they have been 
sponsored by his foes. 
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to face the other candidates, Bernardi laid down stiff terms, 
including refusing to answer questions from the audience and insisting that he 
be permitted to speak last. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would meet his challengers only once and would not participate in a 
debate format but would answer questions asked by a panel he felt was 
impartial. He also said the forum must be sponsored by what he considers an 
impartial group, such as the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can debate with seven people," he said at a press 
conference in his City Hall office. "How can you debate when I'm the target?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only interested in discussing the issues," he said. "All they're doing is 
criticizing me without saying what they would do different." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bernardi's opponents said they welcomed a chance to confront Bernardi 
before an audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the issues with him," said Lyle 
Hall, a labor-backed Los Angeles city firefighter and potentially Bernardi's 
toughest challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, former president of the Los Angeles firefighters' union, said he did not 
care what conditions Bernardi put on the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not put any conditions on any of the appearances that I have made," he 
said. "I walked into what was viewed as potentially unfriendly territory, but I 
felt that's the system. . . . The purpose of having a candidates' forum is so 
the public can ask questions and talk about items of concern to them." 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Jules Bagneris III, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners 
Assn., said Bernardi "has been last on showing leadership on a number of 
issues, so if he wants to be last at a debate, that's no surprise. I don't care 
if he goes first, if he goes in the middle, or if he goes last. I will be 
there."

PARENTS TO BE FINED FOR CURFEW VIOLATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents can be fined up to $500 if their children are caught repeatedly 
violating curfew laws under a new ordinance approved on its first reading 
Tuesday by the Compton City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Patterned after a new curfew law in Washington, which is experiencing a wave of 
violent, drug-related gang activity, the ordinance amends the city's existing 
10 p.m. curfew law. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will put some teeth in it," said Timothy Iverson, director of 
the city's intergovernmental and grants office, which had the task of finding a 
model for Compton's new curfew. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, which must go through a second reading Tuesday, there is 
no fine for the parent or guardian of a person under 18 who is arrested for a 
curfew violation. For a second curfew offense, however, the fine will be at 
least $100 and for the third or subsequent offenses can be $500.

EX-HOSPITAL CHIEF ADMITS TO KICKBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former administrator of a Monrovia hospital has pleaded guilty in U.S. 
District Court to accepting $6,000 in kickbacks from two doctors to allow them 
to continue managing the hospital's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Cheshire, 46, who served as administrator of Monrovia Community Hospital 
in 1985 and 1986, also pleaded guilty to filing a fraudulent income tax return, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Brian Hennigan said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cheshire, who is now the administrator of Los Angeles Doctors Hospital, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cheshire's attorney, Ronald Nessim, said his client was approached in 1985 by 
the two doctors because they wanted him to ask the hospital's parent 
corporation, Paracelsus Health Corp., to extend their contracts and increase 
their pay. 
</P>
<P>
Nessim said Cheshire spent the money on parties to improve employee morale.

COPTER DOOR LANDS ON ROOF OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cargo door from a Los Angeles County sheriff's helicopter fell off while the 
craft was in flight Tuesday and landed on the roof of an Altadena home, causing 
only minor damage to a chimney, authorities said. No one was injured and the 
helicopter continued on its mission. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, with its crew of five, including two paramedics, was en route 
to an automobile accident in Palmdale when the sheet metal door, which weighs 
about 25 pounds, flew off in high winds and "fluttered to the ground like a 
feather," said Sgt. Doug Travis of the sheriff's Aero Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Travis said the craft, a Sikorsky S-58-T, a modified version of a military 
CH-34 used for troop transportation in Vietnam, is one of three such 
helicopters operated by the county. He said the craft, built in the late 1960s, 
is the largest in the county's fleet and has a relatively problem-free history. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the safest helicopters that we can fly over the community," 
Travis said.

FED-UP COUNCIL CLOSE TO TELLING COMPANY ITS COMPOST PLAN IS TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It must have seemed like a good idea at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But after five years of wrangling and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal 
and consulting fees, the city of Los Angeles is just about ready to give up on 
a controversial proposal to turn 850 tons of garbage a day into compost that 
would be sold for a host of industrial and agricultural uses. 
</P>
<P>
After some heated debate and occasionally angry testimony, the City Council on 
Tuesday gave the proponent of the plan just eight more weeks to make its best 
and final contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everyone Is Fed Up' 
</P>
<P>
City officials who have been attempting to negotiate a contract with California 
Co-Composting Systems Inc. recommended that the council drop the entire matter 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina wrapped up the feelings of most of her colleagues 
when she finally declared in frustration, "Everyone is fed up with this." 
</P>
<P>
But the politically well connected firm, with its bevy of lobbyists busily 
working the council chamber, was able to keep the idea alive. 
</P>
<P>
The reprieve from a city administrative office request to drop the project may 
be for naught as many city officials question whether the company will ever be 
able to make good on its promises. 
</P>
<P>
California Co-Composting has proposed mixing city garbage with sludge from the 
Hyperion or Terminal Island sewage plants to form a compost material. Similar 
materials are produced in Europe and used in construction of highway retaining 
walls, non-food soil projects and in high-tech air pollution "scrubber" 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Lobbyist 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Acosta, founder of California Co-Composting and a former lobbyist who 
has given more than $25,000 in campaign contributions to council members since 
the compost project was first considered in 1983, said in an interview that he 
is also negotiating with six other California cities and counties that he would 
not identify. 
</P>
<P>
The company has no working composting facility but has effectively produced 
state legislation during the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 California Co-Composting successfully sponsored legislation encouraging 
state departments to use its products in place of cinder blocks and similar 
products. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 it successfully sponsored legislation for the state to coordinate tests 
to determine whether its products are suitable for state use. 
</P>
<P>
And in the current session, the company sponsored a bill that seeks to 
establish a composting facility on a state prison site. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie told the council that while California 
Co-Composting claims to want nothing more than the city's garbage -- and a 
nominal fee for hauling it away -- that is not what they have tried to 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"When they come to the table, it's never anything like that," said Comrie. 
</P>
<P>
Comrie told the council that California Co-Composting's proposals would leave 
the city holding the bag for millions of dollars in bonds and liable for any 
cost overruns for construction of a production plant. The firm wants the city 
to provide the credit for the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, who said he has already spent $2.8 million on the proposal and has 
backers ready to pour in $18 million to $20 million more, denied Comrie's 
accusation. He said he would be satisfied with a simple contract guaranteeing a 
supply of city garbage and sludge for 25 years and a fee of $17 to $55 a ton to 
take it away. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love the simple approach," Comrie agreed. "And they keep selling it (to 
the council) on that basis." 
</P>
<P>
California Co-Composting has until May 15 to deliver a take-it-or-leave-it 
contract to the city. The city administrative officer then has 30 days to 
produce a report on the contract for the council to consider and take to a 
final vote.

OFFICER CHARGED WITH MOLESTING 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Los Angeles police officer was charged Tuesday with molesting a 
14-year-old girl after talking his way into her home in the middle of the night 
by pretending he was conducting an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Officer Stanley Yorikazu Tanabe, 32, was identified by the 
girl as the policeman who terrorized her family at their Hollywood home on Jan. 
29, then returned on March 1, both times off-duty but in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
During the second incident, other officers were called to the scene and seized 
Tanabe, a 6 1/2-year officer assigned to the 200-member Metro Division, as he 
left the home. Tanabe was released at the time without being booked, but was 
ordered confined to his home pending an investigation of the case. 
</P>
<P>
After the filing of charges, Tanabe surrendered to authorities late Tuesday and 
was ordered held on four felony counts in lieu of $250,000 bail by Los Angeles 
Municipal Judge David Milton. He was charged with two counts of burglary and 
one each of child molestation and assault with intent to molest. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Paul DePasquale, said Tanabe will plead not guilty at his 
arraignment, which was scheduled for April 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Posed a Danger 
</P>
<P>
The defense asked that Tanabe be released on his own recognizance, but Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Kenneth Freeman argued that the officer posed a danger to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is it's absolutely outrageous that an off-duty officer would use his 
uniform, badge, gun, and baton . . . to force his way into a house . . . 
terrifying these people." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the amount is unreasonable," Milton said in setting the bail, 
noting that Tanabe is charged with committing serious crimes "under color of 
authority." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Tanabe selected the girl as his victim after spotting her on 
the street and asking her where she lived. 
</P>
<P>
According to police records, the girl told authorities that the officer had 
driven by her house several times before she awoke about 3 a.m. on Jan. 29 to 
find him standing by her bed and shining a flashlight in her face. 
</P>
<P>
He allegedly had gained entry to the house by telling her parents -- who speak 
only Spanish but awakened their 7-year-old son to translate -- that he was 
responding to a call about someone screaming for help. When they explained 
there was no problem, he threatened to kick the door in to check the residence, 
according to police records. 
</P>
<P>
The girl told authorities the man lifted her nightshirt, ordered her to put her 
hands on her head and molested her. When she resisted, he placed one hand on 
his gun, she said. Apparently thinking that he was impersonating an officer, 
the girl told Tanabe she would call the police, according to the report. He 
reportedly said he was just doing his job and checking for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe left, but allegedly returned a few minutes later with a photograph of a 
man he said was wanted for murder and who purportedly lived at that address. He 
insisted on speaking with the girl in private in the bedroom, where he accused 
her of selling drugs, associating with gang members and having information 
about hidden weapons -- all of which she denied, records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe allegedly returned to the home about 8 p.m. on March 1. After learning 
that the girl's parents were not home, he went to her bedroom, found her 
talking on the telephone to a friend and told her to hang up, according to 
police reports. Speaking in rapid Spanish, she told her friend to call the 
police, then ran to a neighbor's house and called them herself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken Into Custody 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe was taken into custody as he walked from the house. He was placed on 
administrative leave with pay and ordered confined to his north Los Angeles 
County home while the Police Department's internal affairs division completed 
its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the investigation had found "possible 
strong evidence" against Tanabe. 
</P>
<P>
Like all applicants for police jobs, Tanabe had undergone a battery of 
psychological tests before he was hired, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney DePasquale said he has not yet had an opportunity to review 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some sort of an awful confusion," he said. "There is nothing in this 
fellow's background that would lead you to believe he could have done something 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
He said Tanabe had offered to submit to a polygraph test, but that the district 
attorney's office declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe is married and the father of an infant, DePasquale said. 
</P>
<P>
He could be sentenced to nine years in state prison if convicted on all counts.

BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE EVEN MORE; 
</P>
<P>
REPORTS SAY HE GAMBLED ON BASEBALL, TREATED FAMILY BADLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose, being investigated by the baseball commissioner's office for 
possible gambling activities, is also under close scrutiny from two of the 
nation's magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The specifics of major league baseball's investigation of the Cincinnati Reds' 
manager is for possible betting on baseball games, Sports Illustrated reported 
in this week's issue. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ferguson, the Reds' vice president for publicity, said he spoke with Rose 
Tuesday night about the Sports Illustrated allegations. "He's just continuing, 
as he has all along, not to have anything to say," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
And Rose was not only a gambler, but a poor father and husband who rarely 
showed affection, flaunted his affairs and rarely saw his first two children, 
according to the April issue of Gentlemen's Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball officials announced Monday that Rose was under investigation for 
unspecified gambling activity. Rose has previously admitted to parimutuel 
betting on horses and dogs, a legal endeavor, but has denied betting on 
baseball and college basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
Rose could be suspended for a year, according to baseball rules, if he bet on 
games not involving his team. If Rose bet on games involving the Reds, he could 
be banned for life. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated said that Ron Peters, the owner of a restaurant in Franklin, 
Ohio, has been linked to possible baseball betting involving Rose. 
</P>
<P>
It said that Alan Statman, Peters' lawyer, described his client as Rose's 
"principal bookmaker" and approached the magazine last week in hopes of selling 
Peters' story. The magazine said it declined. 
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Daily News, in a copyright story, said Rose is under investigation 
by federal agents looking into gambling allegations. The newspaper did not 
identify its source but said the investigation stemmed from an unrelated 
investigation of Peters, whom, the paper said, filed for bankruptcy Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated also said that Statman told two of its reporters that he and 
his client had been asked by Kevin Hallinan, baseball's security chief, "if we 
had information on Pete Rose betting on baseball. We said we can supply that 
information." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine added that Paul Janszen, whom it described as a body builder 
friend of Rose, is "another man said by sources to have been involved with Rose 
in baseball betting." 
</P>
<P>
Janszen also recently discussed selling a story about Rose to Sports 
Illustrated, the magazine said. Janszen is serving a six-month sentence in a 
Cincinnati halfway house after pleading guilty in January to a charge of 
evading taxes on income from the sale of steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated said that another weightlifter, who was not identified, told 
the magazine that he had placed bets on baseball games that he understood to be 
from Rose, using a telephone at a gym in suburban Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"Janszen used to come into the gym, pull out the newspaper and go over all the 
baseball games," the magazine quoted the unidentified weightlifter as saying. 
"He'd mark them with a pen, then he'd go into the office and phone in bets for 
Pete Rose. He never said he was doing it for Pete. But that's what the talk was 
around the gym." 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated said that Michael Fry, a former co-owner of the gym, who is 
serving eight years in federal prison for cocaine trafficking and income-tax 
evasion, told its reporter that Rose never bet on baseball games but often 
talked about which baseball teams would be good to bet on. 
</P>
<P>
Fry also said, according to the magazine, that he had heard that Tommy Gioisa, 
also a friend of Rose's, placed bets with bookies on college and pro basketball 
and football games and that Fry said he understood that those bets were for 
Rose. Gioisa told the magazine that he was a professional gambler, but said he 
had never placed a bet for Rose. 
</P>
<P>
In the story in Gentleman's Quarterly, it was reported that Rose was rumored to 
have lost $13,000 in one day at a race track. 
</P>
<P>
Karolyn Rose is quoted as saying that her former husband once refused to 
acknowledge a gambling debt and later received a dead fish in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was Pete Rose, and he didn't have to pay no gambling debts," 
Karolyn Rose said in the article. 
</P>
<P>
However, Karolyn Rose told the Associated Press that she had been misquoted and 
didn't know anything about a dead fish being delivered to her former husband. 
She also said that Rose has never bet on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, written by Pat Jordan, Rose's daughter, Fawn, calls him "the 
world's worst father." 
</P>
<P>
"I will never understand why he never had any time for us," Fawn Rose said. "We 
didn't expect anything from him, except to just like us. All we ever did was 
love him and want him to love us back." 
</P>
<P>
Rose's son, Pete Jr., also described his father, who has remarried and had 
another son since divorcing his first wife, as distant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not alike," said Rose Jr., a third baseman in the Baltimore Orioles' 
minor league system. "I never hugged or kissed my dad. If I did, he'd think I 
was a sissy. My relationship with him is more player-manager. Sometimes he 
gives me a high five." 
</P>
<P>
Karolyn Rose said she filed for divorce in 1979 because Rose "was flaunting his 
women and I had to protect the kids, not because I didn't love him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she said she hasn't dated since the divorce and still sets an extra 
plate at the dinner table every Jan. 25 on their wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"I still believe he'll come home someday," she was quoted as saying. "Is that 
stupid?" 
</P>
<P>
Rose would not talk about either the commissioner's investigation or the 
magazine stories and there was extra security in Al Lang Stadium at St. 
Petersburg, Fla., where the Reds are in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Rose arrived about an hour before an exhibition game against the St. Louis 
Cardinals, walked briskly through two dozen reporters and photographers, and 
remained in his office, where an armed, uniformed guard stood watch. 
</P>
<P>
Rose gave his usual pregame radio interview to broadcaster Marty Brennaman, but 
shed no light on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Marty, all I can tell you is we are cooperating with the commissioner's 
office, and we hope that it gets taken care of real fast, before opening day, 
so we can get down to business," Rose said. "And business is winning the 
National League West. That's all I'd like to say about that." 
</P>
<P>
While reporters waited for Rose, players worked out on the field, sneaking 
looks at the throng. They had to pick their way through the crowd to get to the 
bat rack.

THE ILLINI KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA McKEE, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name of the game is basketball, but when opposing coaches and players look 
at Illinois, other games come to mind. The Illini conjure up other images: 
relay teams, high jumpers, sprinters and sleight-of-hand artists. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini are quicksilver, skimming over the basketball court like the wind. 
</P>
<P>
But when he hears Louisville Coach Denny Crum talk about Illinois' "great 
athletic ability," Illini guard Kendall Gill looks unhappy. When Ball State 
Coach Rick Majerus says, "Illinois has some world-class athletes; you could 
have a great track team," Gill looks downright depressed. 
</P>
<P>
Gill is one of those streaking athletes who leaves defenders sucking air. 
</P>
<P>
And Kendall Gill is one of the primary reasons No. 3-ranked Illinois (29-4) is 
favored to reach the Final Four of the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
Tournament. In this week's Sweet 16, Illinois takes on Louisville (24-8) Friday 
in the Midwest Regional semifinal in the Metrodome in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the winner will play the winner of Friday's Missouri-Syracuse semifinal 
for the right to advance to the Final Four in Seattle, April 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
Gill missed 12 games this season with a broken foot, but he has not missed a 
beat since returning in time for the final two regular-season games. With Gill 
in the lineup, the Illini are 21-0. But please, don't use the word athlete 
around Gill. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish they'd stop saying it," he said. "Why can't people just say we're 
a good basketball team? We're not track athletes or football players. You could 
put a track team out here and I doubt that they'd be very good at playing 
basketball. We're basketball players. The athleticism just makes us better." 
</P>
<P>
Gill says he is pleased that the basketball world "is saying stuff" about the 
Illini, "but I'd rather be known as a great basketball player instead of a 
great athlete. Athletes aren't supposed to be intelligent. But if you look 
around this locker room, you'll see a room full of intelligent players. Why is 
it the only player on a team who is supposed to be intelligent is the coach's 
son, and he's never a great athlete?" 
</P>
<P>
While opposing coaches talk about how the Illini use their athletic talent to 
break up passing lanes, Gill would like someone to recognize the team's 
basketball savvy. 
</P>
<P>
"We know how to handle a lead," he said. "Give us credit for spreading the 
floor when we need to. We give a great athletic effort, but when (guard) Steve 
Bardo is running our team, give him credit for setting up the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Then Gill smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's difficult for television to show Steve setting up the offense," 
he said. "I guess for television it makes more sense to show the spinning 
reverse dunk. That's what sells. People don't pay to see you do math problems." 
</P>
<P>
It is athleticism, and a new-found maturity, that set this year's Illinois team 
apart from those of the past. In other seasons, the Illini would be home on 
spring break by now. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Austin Peay upset Illinois, 68-67, in the first round of the 
NCAA Tournament. Last year, it was Villanova recovering from a 10-point deficit 
in the final minutes to win, 66-63, in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought about the Villanova game," Gill said. "It crossed my mind once in 
the second half against Ball State, when they closed within six points and we 
were missing our foul shots. But then we scored a basket and the thought 
disappeared. We didn't allow ourselves to think the game was over until it was 
over. We wouldn't want anyone to come back on us like Villanova did. You can't 
afford to soften up." 
</P>
<P>
In Indianapolis last Saturday, the Illini beat Ball State, 72-60, in the second 
round despite the Cardinals' efforts to muscle Illinois out of its game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you saw our maturity against Ball State," Gill said. "They were trying 
to push us around and take us out of the game mentally with a lot of talk. Last 
year it probably would have developed into a bench-clearing brawl. If we were 
immature, we would have gotten into that and our heads would have gotten out of 
the game. We would have lost." 
</P>
<P>
But this team does not appear to be a choker. At least not yet. Appearances, 
though, can be deceiving. After all, the Illini look as though they've just 
escaped from the Atlantic Coast Conference, not the physical Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
The shortest player on the team is Gill, at 6-foot-4, and the tallest is Lowell 
Hamilton, who at 6-7 and about 209 pounds plays center because someone has to 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Battle, a superb 6-6 swingman, probably leads the team in acrobatic dunks 
and hustle. Nick Anderson, also 6-6, hit the 35-footer at the buzzer that beat 
Indiana the last week of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Four players average in double figures: Anderson (17.6), Battle (16.2), Gill 
(15.5) and Hamilton (14.1). And then there's 6-8 sophomore Marcus Liberty (8.6 
points). Perhaps because Coach Lou Henson didn't rush him, Liberty is beginning 
to live up to his reputation as the nation's top player coming out of high 
school two years ago. He sat out last season because he didn't meet Proposition 
48's academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a team in the country that hustles more than this team," Henson 
said. "We are small. We give away muscle. We give away height. And we don't do 
everything right. But we always, always, hustle. Other teams might outmuscle us 
and they might try to work against our pressure, but no one is going to work 
against our quickness." 
</P>
<P>
And, Kendall Gill might add, no one is going to outscore them in basketball 
savvy, either.

NEWSWIRE: OFFICIAL SAYS IOC HOPES TO START RANDOM TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee hopes to introduce random doping controls 
in its bid to combat drug use in amateur sport, an IOC spokeswoman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Verdier, IOC director of information, also said that, despite 
suggestions amateur sports bodies are losing the battle against drug use, the 
IOC never will permit performance-enhancing substances to be legalized. 
</P>
<P>
"Lifting the ban on drugs is absolutely not a consideration," she said. "We 
need the absolute cooperation of everyone in sport for a program of random 
doping control. We're looking at flying-squad labs and putting in more testing 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's a question of money and technology and in certain parts of the 
world, we are facing some difficulties."

A man described as an employee of slugger Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics 
allegedly had steroids on him when he was arrested on a concealed-weapons 
charge while trying to board a plane with Canseco, records show. 
</P>
<P>
David Valdes was arrested Jan. 21 at Detroit Metropolitan Airport for allegedly 
possessing a loaded handgun as he and Canseco left Michigan after a baseball 
card show. 
</P>
<P>
Valdes denied that 26 tablets found in his briefcase were steroids, saying they 
were "prescription pills . . . to make me gain weight and strength," according 
to records. 
</P>
<P>
State police laboratory tests determined the pills were steroids, according to 
a report obtained by the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Valdes "in no way implicates Jose," an unidentified law 
enforcement official told the newspaper.

FORMER SPRINTER WILLIAMS RECALLS STEROID USE IN '70S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1983, Steve Williams, who for a decade had been America's best sprinter, sat 
down and wrote a screenplay. He described it as an Animal House-type look at 
the world of big time track and field. Williams told a story of under-the-table 
payments and indiscriminate drug use. It was a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"No one believed it," Williams said recently. "No one wanted to touch it. Now, 
with what we all know about the sport, lots of producers are interested." 
</P>
<P>
Williams has rewritten and updated his screenplay, which he calls "Speeding." 
The story is not so funny anymore. 
</P>
<P>
When he was the world's dominant sprinter in the 1970s, Williams saw plenty of 
anabolic steroid use. But, he says, he is disturbed with the portrait that has 
emerged from the Canadian government's inquiry into drug use by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 35, held the world record at 100 meters, 100 yards and 220 yards, 
graduated from San Diego State and now lives in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. He says that 
both the uses for steroids and the amounts used have increased radically. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that people were running at incredible speeds," Williams 
said. "You have to take extraordinary measures to repair your body. In the 
'70s, steroids were used as a rehabilitative drug. You would take five 
milligrams, three times a week at a rehab center. The amounts were reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you are talking about 150-milligram injections. You are taking your life 
into your own hands. You are admitting defeat if you have to go to that. I 
don't want to split hairs, but there is a difference between someone taking a 
substance during a specific period to get past an injury, and someone who takes 
it every day." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' career was hampered by injuries. In 1972, he had qualified for the 
U.S. Olympic trials at 100, 200 and 400 meters, but suffered a leg injury 
before the competition. In 1976, Williams was the heavy favorite in the sprints 
before Montreal, but he pulled a hamstring in the heats at trials and did not 
make the team. Williams finally made the Olympic team in 1980, but could not 
compete in Moscow because of the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was prominent at a time when the U.S. domination of track and field 
was being challenged by the Eastern Bloc. To Americans, the sudden sight of the 
obviously stronger East European athletes was both shocking and alarming. 
</P>
<P>
"They were coming out in areas that were not their domain," Williams said. "It 
became geopolitical war. They put their little soldiers on the line. They had a 
strong chemical strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that even when steroids were first tested for, at the 1976 
Olympics, and after, drug use did not decline. In fact, he said, use increased, 
with the help of officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1977 World Cup was the first competition that was advertising heavy drug 
testing," he said. "It didn't have any effect at all on the athletes. . . . 
There was no testing. We ran a world record in the relay. Of course we expected 
to be tested. Nope. Testing was just a scare tactic. They manipulated the drug 
testing for their own benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he's saddened by the level of drug use in track today. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm seeing with the young athletes is they think drugs make you," he 
said. "They don't see that they will also break you."

threatened by Norby Walters because of comments the sports agent made after 
Woods fired him. 
</P>
<P>
A tape recording of a conversation between the two was played at the agent's 
federal court trial, and Walters was heard saying he didn't want "to be a rat" 
and cause problems over being replaced by another agent. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, Texas football players Everett Gay and Edwin Simmons told 
of a threat by Bloom to have thugs break Gay's legs because he was talking 
about terminating his contract with the sports agents. Gay now plays for the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 58, and co-defendant Lloyd Bloom, 29, are charged with racketeering, 
fraud and extortion.

Tim Littles, a light-middleweight amateur boxer from Flint, Mich., has learned 
that he was not a winner in amateur boxing's World Championships Challenge in 
Casablanca, Morocco, last month. 
</P>
<P>
Littles, 24, defeated East German Torsten Schmitz in the bout -- or thought he 
had. Littles' hand was raised by the referee when he was announced as the 3-2 
winner and he was also awarded a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
But the USA Amateur Boxing Federation received official results this week from 
the International Amateur Boxing Assn., and Littles is listed as the loser. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people left Casablanca under the impression that Tim had won, but the 
official AIBA results show a jury overturned the Littles decision due to an 
'addition error' on the part of a Moroccan judge," said Leslie King of the 
USA/ABF.

SCOTT OSTLER: CHRIS GWYNN POSES INTERESTING CHOICE FOR DODGER BRASS 
</P>

<P>
Every spring training camp has an interesting kid, and you don't need a program 
to find him. He steps into the batting cage and a scout or a coach will lean 
over to you and whisper, "Now here's an interesting kid." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gwynn is that kid for the Dodgers this spring. Take Monday's game against 
the Atlanta Braves, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
First inning, trying to protect a baserunner on a hit and run, Gwynn gets into 
an 0-and-2 hole against pitcher Pete Smith, but winds up doubling off the top 
of the center-field fence, a millimeter away from a homer. 
</P>
<P>
Third inning, Gwynn finds himself 0-and-2 again. Fouls off two pitches. Takes a 
ball. Hits a curveball over the right-field fence, a flat rainbow. Two innings 
later, he fights out of another 0-and-2 count and winds up with another double. 
</P>
<P>
That made Chris a neat 17-for-34 for the spring. Great swing, great attitude, 
great blood lines, very nice progress in two seasons of triple A, but can Chris 
Gwynn crack the big club? 
</P>
<P>
Who knows? He is in the mysterious world of major league baseball. His manager 
is an all-world talker, but Tom Lasorda hasn't dropped a clue to Gwynn 
regarding his immediate fate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real vague around here," Gwynn said before Tuesday's game, in which he 
got a pinch-hit to drive his average up to .514. "Nobody says anything to you. 
You kind of have to get a feel for it yourself. I really don't have any idea 
(if he has a shot at making the opening-day roster)." 
</P>
<P>
It could be a battle between Gwynn and Franklin Stubbs. Stubbs is 28, a .222 
hitter with home run power, who strikes out once every four at-bats. Gwynn, 24, 
more of a doubles-type hitter, hit .299 at Albuquerque last season, and against 
minor league pitching he strikes out about once every 10 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
The old problem -- do you go with proven mediocrity or with intriguing 
potential? 
</P>
<P>
What helps makes Chris Gwynn such an interesting kid is his gene pool, which is 
both curse and blessing. He is the younger brother of Tony Gwynn, one of the 
game's great hitters, and Chris patiently endures the comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
They are both stocky -- Chris is 6-foot-2 and 200 pounds -- left-handed hitters 
with nearly identical hitting styles and philosophies. As expressed by Tony, 
that philosophy is: "See the ball, hit it hard." 
</P>
<P>
"You try not to make it more complicated than it is," Chris says. "You hit the 
ball where it's pitched. We won't hit a lot of home runs, but we both go to the 
opposite field well." 
</P>
<P>
They are both line-drive spray hitters, although the philosophy and style is 
nothing Chris deliberately copied from Tony. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really tried to pattern myself after him," Chris says. "Everybody 
else does that for me." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the similarities are marked. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be in the genes," Chris says, and that's one factor that will keep 
Lasorda and Fred Claire up late at night this week and next, deciding what to 
do with the kid. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball sibling gene evaluation can be tricky. The Aaron brothers, Henry and 
Tommie, divided up their baseball genes unequally, Hank getting about 95% of 
the pot. Jose Canseco is a superstar but his twin brother is a struggling minor 
leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are more equitable distributions, like the three Alous, the three 
DiMaggios -- Vince and Dom were no stiffs -- and the two pitching Perrys. 
</P>
<P>
The point is this: Can the Dodgers afford to let Chris Gwynn slip away to 
another team, or waste away in the minors, when he just might be the second 
coming of Tony Gwynn? 
</P>
<P>
Chris would rather make the club on his own merit, by doing things like hitting 
.514 in spring training, but if the family name gives him a slight edge in the 
final analysis, he'll take it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, if working in Tony's shadow really bothered Chris, he could have 
stayed with his No. 1 sport, basketball. He was the sixth man on Long Beach 
Poly's Southern Section championship team in 1981, and had many more offers to 
play college basketball than baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He took a baseball scholarship to San Diego State. The basketball coach invited 
him to play, but Chris declined. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to concentrate on baseball," Gwynn says. "I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
His third and last season at San Diego State, Chris set a National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. record for hits in a season, 137. Then he signed with the 
Dodgers and has developed steadily in four minor league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is, will the Dodgers keep him around as a pinch-hitter and 
reserve outfielder, or send him back to play full time at Albuquerque? 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda isn't saying, because he and Claire probably haven't decided yet. Maybe 
it's better not to say anything to the kid now, not raise his hopes or 
discourage him. 
</P>
<P>
Chris reads the lineup card every day, and goes to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to have a good attitude, an open mind," he says, and there's something 
else the Gwynn brothers have in common. Tony has a reputation for being one of 
baseball's nicest, most upbeat people. He and Chris talk frequently by phone, 
and Tony tells Chris to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
"The mental approach to the game is very important," Chris says. "The situation 
I'm in, it could drive you crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a good enough spring, if they do send me back, I could hold my head 
up." 
</P>
<P>
But could Lasorda and Claire?

STATE WILDLIFE OFFICIALS TRYING TO WARD OFF RISING COST OF MANAGEMENT, 
DEVELOPMENT

<P>
Wildlife officials are proud of their work at the Grizzly Island Wildlife Area. 
Their herd of tule elk has grown to more than 100 since seven from the Owens 
Valley were introduced to the area in 1977. And the herd is still prospering. 
</P>
<P>
River otters still swim playfully in the meandering waterways, home also to 
giant white sturgeon and striped bass. Eagles and hawks soar over sprawling 
wetlands that support millions of giant-sized jack rabbits, all wide-eyed and 
alert to the dangers of the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Nature's ways are evident. But man's are becoming increasingly evident, too, 
which concerns officials. 
</P>
<P>
They say rampant development results in overcrowding and pollution. 
Furthermore, the growing inability of hunters and fishermen to provide adequate 
funding for wildlife management and land acquisition makes it more difficult to 
protect the fragile areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 28 million (people in California) going to 40 million by the year 
2010," Director Pete Bontadelli said. "Clearly the pressures on wildlife are 
greater than anything we've seen before." 
</P>
<P>
Given these projections, Bontadelli said the state's ability to manage existing 
wildlands, and the opportunity to make future land acquisitions, is becoming 
more restricted. In short, revenue isn't keeping up with the rising costs of 
wildlife management. 
</P>
<P>
The grizzly bear, California's proud symbol of strength, is long gone, and 
officials fear more species native to the state might also become extinct. The 
kit fox, bald eagle, and peregrine falcon, to name a few, are endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, through bond issues over the years, Californians have helped the 
state set aside about 400,000 acres of precious wildlife habitat, which 
Bontadelli said supports many of these endangered and threatened species. He 
claims, however, that such land is becoming more difficult to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem DFG officials might have to address in the near future involves 
a proposed cap on federal aid to the various states for wildlife management. If 
the proposal -- included in the Reagan administration budget for fiscal 1990 -- 
is passed by Congress, there would be $100-million caps on both the 
Dingell-Johnson and Pittman-Robertson funds, federally relegated funds that 
support the states' wildlife agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The fund, which began in 1937, raises money through taxes on sporting firearms 
and ammunition. In the last fiscal year, it raised $119 million for state 
agencies involved with wildlife restoration and hunter safety. The 
Pittman-Robertson fund is credited with creating modern game management 
agencies in the states. 
</P>
<P>
The Dingell-Johnson program, which began in 1950 and was expanded in 1984 under 
the Wallop-Breaux Act, raises money by taxing fishing tackle and boats. It 
raised $179.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the money is used to acquire and improve habitat and 
restock species wiped out by excessive hunting or poor land-management 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
The comebacks of the whitetail deer, wild turkey and wood duck, as well as the 
native brook trout and the cutthroat trout, can be traced to the two programs. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the White House, President Bush said he would 
recommend to Congress that "the funds be used for the purposes intended." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bontadelli: "We're hopeful that Congress will not allow (the cap) to take 
affect. At this point, it's in Congress' hands." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Bontadelli emphasized that the department needs more money to 
assure the quality of wildlife for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
Some help has come through the California Wildlands Program. 
</P>
<P>
It was dedicated at Grizzly Island Feb. 13 under the slogan: "Save Our Wild 
Places," and is expected to be in full operation by April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at increasing the state's revenue by charging visitors -- not just 
hunters and fishermen -- to nine major wildlife areas, the program is being 
hailed by conservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Habitat loss is the greatest overall threat to California's wildlife," said 
Richard Spotts, California representative of Defenders of Wildlife. 
"Traditional hunting and fishing revenues have not kept pace with the mounting 
conservation challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Egan, president of the California Waterfowl Assn., said: "We're hoping that 
with this new program, and others like it, the rest of the public is going to 
make their contribution or else we're going to lose a lot of resources we don't 
want to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Egan said only about 290,000 acres of wetlands are left in California, down 
from millions years ago. Suisun Marsh, which surrounds the DFG-managed Grizzly 
Island, has shrunk -- through erosion, reclamation and agricultural and 
industrial development -- from 750,000 acres to 85,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the North American (Waterfowl Management) plan (a joint United 
States-Canada effort) we're trying to reestablish wetlands area in California 
and North America," Egan said. "Now they've got a money stream that's going to 
help us create more wetlands." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the support, however, will come from sales of annual and daily wildlife 
passes, at $10 and $2, respectively, and native species stamps, which can be 
bought at DFG offices and sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
The passes will enable visitors at any of these wildlife areas "to see 
first-hand, enjoy, watch and photograph such wildlife as tule elk, bald eagles, 
river otters, white pelicans and flocks of waterfowl in a natural setting." 
</P>
<P>
As George Gamble of the California Trappers Assn. put it: "It's time for 
nonconsumptive users to lend their support." 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife interpreters, as well as photography blinds, nature trails and posted 
descriptions of wildlife are included in the price. 
</P>
<P>
The eight other reserves are: 
</P>
<P>
The Lake Earl Wildlife Area in Del Norte County; Ash Creek Wildlife Area on the 
Modoc-Lassen County line; Gray Lodge Wildlife Area in Sutter and Butte 
counties; Los Banos Wildlife Area in Merced County; Elkhorn Slough Ecological 
Reserve on the Monterey Peninsula; San Jacinto Wildlife Area in Riverside 
County; Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve in Orange County and the 
Imperial-Wister Wildlife Area in Imperial County. 
</P>
<P>
The Grizzly Island Wildlife Area lies in the heart of Suisun Marsh, named years 
ago by the Patwin Indians who used to hunt and fish here. The "Land of the West 
Wind," as it is appropriately called, is home to 200 species of birds, 45 
species of mammals and 36 types of reptiles and amphibians. The sprawling tidal 
wetlands are one of the country's most important. As much as 25% of the state's 
wintering waterfowl might be concentrated here at one time. 
</P>
<P>
Short-eared owls, ring-necked pheasants and ducks of all varieties -- there are 
150 private hunting clubs in the area -- are part of the scenery, as are 
numerous birds of prey, including the majestic golden eagle. 
</P>
<P>
The tule elk, one of 20 herds in the state, graze on prickly lettuce and 
grasses and, being excellent swimmers, can at times be seen crossing with grace 
the many sloughs and waterways that wind through the wetlands. During mating 
season, the bulls put on an impressive display of bugling and knocking horns in 
competition for their prospective harems. 
</P>
<P>
Though prospering now, these animals serve as a reminder of how reckless 
disregard for wildlife can lead to the inadvertent extermination of a species. 
Tule elk are native to this area, but were wiped out during the Gold Rush by 
the 49ers, who, according to wildlife supervisor Dennis Becker, "took away 
their habitat and used the animals for hides and food." 
</P>
<P>
The present herd is but one example of how, with proper management, a species 
can be saved from extinction and managed effectively. 
</P>
<P>
The question now, however, is whether the Wildlands program will gain 
acceptance among the public and provide the necessary funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very comfortable that in the first 18 months we can generate at least 
$5.6 million," Bontadelli said. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, the department must sell 200,000 outdoor passes and 100,000 native 
species stamps, a goal Bontadelli believes is realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, I think that's where we need to be," he said. "It will also 
provide a funding base for the marine mammal program, threatened and endangered 
species programs, fisheries (management) and much of our non-game program in 
wildlife management. So this is critical for our wide variety of species' needs 
and management objectives for the department."

TWO CLEVELAND JOKERS HAVE A BALL WITH JOYNER

<P>
Wally Joyner walked out of the Angel clubhouse Tuesday with a basketball in his 
hands, a sight that should have struck fear into the hearts and minds of his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Stop him, before he shoots again. 
</P>
<P>
No need to worry, Wally assured all. The basketball was a practical joke, 
planted in Joyner's locker by Cleveland Indians Joe Carter and Cory Snyder, who 
signed their names along with the inscription: "You Can Always Play For Our 
Team." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner said he was going to return the favor. 
</P>
<P>
"My buddies," he said with a grin. "This might be going back to the Indians -- 
with something else on it. I told them to beware." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Joyner had delivered the Indians a message of a different 
kind. Back in the lineup for the first time since last Tuesday's fateful 
basketball injury, Joyner tested his ankle for seven innings against Cleveland 
and went 1 for 4, driving in two runs to help the Angels to a 7-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Returning about a week earlier than team trainers had originally projected, 
Joyner drove in the Angels' first run with a first-inning groundout and broke a 
5-5 tie in the fifth inning with a run-scoring single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good," Joyner said, referring to his tightly taped left ankle. "It 
felt different, but I took a little extra batting practice and after a while, 
it loosened up." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, it also started to throb, which prompted Angel Manager Doug Rader 
to remove Joyner from the game as a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
"That was from (the ankle) being wrapped up and standing on it for six hours," 
Joyner said. "I'm sure I'll get used to it. I'm pretty sure I'll have to keep 
it wrapped like this the majority of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, batting .273 at the time of the injury, claimed to have found a silver 
lining under all the adhesive tape and liniment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's helped my stroke," he said. "I sprained my left foot, my back 
foot, and it's helped keep me back on my swing. With that ankle, I can't jump 
or lunge at outside pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said Joyner "looked fine" but still wanted to wait for today's results, 
to see how the ankle responds the day after. "How it feels (tomorrow) will be a 
big indication," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to watch it closely tonight," he said. "The trainers say they're 90% 
sure it's going to swell up on me, so I want to keep on top of it." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Joyner spun on his left foot and left the locker room. He had new 
worlds to conquer . . . or, at least, a new prank to avenge. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington (sore right shoulder) also returned to the Angel lineup 
Tuesday -- and finally brought his batting stroke with him. After a 
first-inning fly out extended his hitting slump to 0 for 17, Washington doubled 
in the fourth inning and singled in the sixth. That raised his spring batting 
average from .147 to .184. "He got a couple hits, made a good catch and finally 
showed some legs," Manager Doug Rader said. "You like to see a smattering of 
something out there. You like to see something that shows he can still do it. 
It appears Claudell still can." Good timing, too, Rader suggested, noting Dante 
Bichette's emergence as a dark-horse outfield candidate. "With Dante playing as 
well as he is and showing he's a viable candidate, it's up to the other people 
to respond to the competition," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
With Bryan Harvey, Greg Minton and Willie Fraser locked into three of the five 
bullpen spots, four men continue to compete for the last two openings -- 
left-handers Bob McClure and Vance Lovelace, right-handers Stewart Cliburn and 
Rich Monteleone. Lovelace and Monteleone both worked Tuesday, with Lovelace 
pitching a scoreless inning and Monteleone getting the win (2 innings, 2 hits, 
1 run). Rader liked what he saw from both. On Lovelace: "He's finally showing 
he can get the ball around the plate. If he can just come close to the plate, 
he has enough stuff to get outs on balls outside the strike zone." On 
Monteleone: "He has an off-speed pitch that can neutralize both right-handers 
and left-handers. He also seems durable and gets warm in a hurry, which makes 
him appealing as a long reliever."

NFL WINTER MEETINGS;

<P>
TOO NOISY CHEERING WILL BRING PENALTIES

<P>
If you're planning to see a pro football game next fall, be careful when and 
how you cheer, and how long. And how loud. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably noisy cheering -- at the wrong time -- could bring a penalty of 50 
yards or more against the home team. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the 28 National Football League clubs decided that at the winter 
meetings at Palm Desert Tuesday, when they empowered their officiating crews to 
penalize teams for overzealous crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Referees were authorized to confiscate timeouts or, if necessary, walk off 
penalties against teams whose cheering fans raise the noise level to a pitch 
that disrupts the other team's communications. 
</P>
<P>
At the Seattle Kingdome, for instance, visiting quarterbacks have for years 
complained that their teammates often couldn't hear the signals in the din. 
</P>
<P>
But until now, the NFL has maintained that anti-rabble legislation was 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
As Tex Schramm of the Dallas Cowboys, chairman of the league's competition 
committee, used to say: "You can penalize teams and players -- but not crowds." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's legislation -- approved by a 21-7 vote -- was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ram Coach John Robinson: "It isn't a bad precedent to ensure the normal 
functioning of a game. The colleges have a rule like this." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL rule provides for an unlimited number of yards penalized. Although 
football teams and players can be penalized a maximum of 15 yards for even the 
most flagrant foul, a crowd that refuses to quiet down could draw a penalty of 
50 or 90 yards or even more. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually (from the five-yard line in) it would be only half the distance of 
the field," Schramm said. "So you could never score a touchdown (on the 
penalty)." 
</P>
<P>
Two competition committee spokesmen, Schramm and Miami Coach Don Shula, 
outlined a three-step, noisy-stadium procedure: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The referee will first advise the fans and the defensive players that there 
will be a penalty unless the clamor abates. 
</P>
<P>
If it doesn't, he will take away one or more timeouts -- assuming the home team 
hasn't used them all. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then he will penalize the home team five yards at a time as long as 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, one lost timeout, or one penalty, will be enough," Schramm said. 
"The timeouts will go first because most coaches would rather take a penalty 
than lose a timeout." Shula, representing the coaches, approved of the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The offenses are so sophisticated now that they can operate with hand signals 
in a noisy stadium," he said. "But the problem is that this limits what you can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL conceded that the rule violates the free speech amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a slight infringement," Schramm said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, many sports fans have breached the same precept. 
</P>
<P>
"They have prevented the offensive teams from being able to communicate," Shula 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The league's battle against fake injuries took the form of a statement by the 
competition committee, unopposed by the convention, recommending fines and 
suspensions -- and in serious cases loss of draft choices -- for clubs, coaches 
and even physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the committee, Schramm and Shula, urged the NFL's referees to 
assume that in any instance, a stricken player is injured, even if he has taken 
two or three previous dives, but to put in motion strong disciplinary measures 
if they "sense a pattern" of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was a response to a widely publicized incident last year when the 
Seattle Seahawks were accused of faking injuries six times in one game to foil 
the Cincinnati Bengals' no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
That offense is entirely legal, the competition committee ruled, supporting 
Commissioner Pete Rozelle's position. 
</P>
<P>
Will a mere statement slow the feigning of injuries? 
</P>
<P>
"I think this will stop it," Schramm said. 
</P>
<P>
The league also modified its rule against roughing the passer, enjoining 
rushers from heading for a quarterback's knee when they have a clear path in. 
</P>
<P>
The new language is designed to prevent attacks such as that of Philadelphia's 
Andre Waters on the Rams' Jim Everett last year. 
</P>
<P>
Waters said afterward that he got the only part of Everett he could reach. And 
to some observers, that's the way it looked. 
</P>
<P>
Among others on the competition committee, Shula, however, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was obviously going for the knee," Shula said.

BUCKEY'S RETURN TO TEACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shame on The Times ("A Return to Classroom for Buckey," Metro, March 2) for the 
disgusting pictures of the long-suffering Peggy Ann Buckey and woman and child 
protesting Buckey's return to teaching. The press has almost succeeded in 
totally wrecking this person's life. 
</P>
<P>
The article stated: "The demonstrators said they were outraged that she was 
being allowed to teach again, even though all molestation and conspiracy 
charges against her and four other McMartin teachers were dropped in 1986." 
</P>
<P>
Is this Russia or the land of the free? It is one thing for a handful of 
demonstrators to exhibit their ignorance -- it is quite another for The Times 
to publish this outrageous event. 
</P>
<P>
Let's put an end to the bashing of this woman by the press. Let her get on with 
her life. She is either guilty or innocent. 
</P>
<P>
One of the demonstrators said: "We're not saying she's guilty. We're not saying 
she's innocent We're saying she's suspect." Our courts in the land of the free 
have determined she is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
I thought the days of the "lynch mob" mentality were dead.

MINORITY JOBS AND CLEAN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garcia gets great coverage in The Times. His views are reported on a regular 
basis and they almost invariably bear one implication: that the interests of 
environmentally concerned and affluent Westsiders are in direct conflict with 
the poor of the city's South and East sides, and that the fight for clean air, 
pure water and sensitive land use must invariably lead to class conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Why such conflict should be inevitable is not clear to me. Are residents of 
East and South-Central L.A. any less concerned about noxious air, poisoned 
water and rapacious developers? I doubt it. Witness the vote on Propositions P 
and O last November, when despite efforts to portray opposition to Palisades 
oil drilling as the peculiar enterprise of the privileged Westside, voters all 
over the city turned down Occidental Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
The point usually made by Garcia and others is that development fuels the local 
economy and creates jobs for the disadvantaged. Granted, if all development 
stopped in L.A. tomorrow there would be grievous economic consequences. But how 
do the poor benefit from taking the reins off development on the Westside? 
Making it harder to build in Westwood might just make building in Watts more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, divergence in the interests and concerns of the city's 
rich and poor halves. But I do not see the recent concern with quality of life 
as the root cause of the parting of the ways. A decade of unrestricted 
development has done nothing to even out prospects for the city's wealthy and 
disadvantaged neighborhoods. If anything, the opposite has occurred. Quality of 
life issues need not divide the city along economic lines unless prominent 
people like Garcia insist publicly and repeatedly that they will.

BUT THERE IS AN ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush still is dithering about gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with mounting public and police pressure to regulate the military assault 
weapons that have turned urban streets and school yards into charnel houses, 
the President said Monday, "The country needs to know that there is some answer 
to this. And I don't yet know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Bush went on to tell a group of state legislators visiting the White House that 
he suspects the solution to the assault-weapon problem "is going to be found in 
various ways out in the states" rather than in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
This won't do. The stakes here are literally life and death. But the problem 
itself is not complex. What is required is that the U.S. government immediately 
ban the import of new assault weapons and preferably outlaw, or closely 
regulate, those already in private hands. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of foisting this obvious federal responsibility onto the states or of 
wrestling with imagined constitutional inhibitions to these common-sensical 
steps is simply a lot of politically expedient chat, designed to hold the gun 
lobby zealots at bay. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush truly is at a loss on how to cope with this crisis, we suggest he send 
over to the Congress for copies of bills recently introduced by Rep. Howard L. 
Berman (D-Calif.) and Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Both are at great pains to define military-style assault weapons precisely. 
Their proposals would not touch semiautomatic rifles or shotguns designed for a 
legitimate sporting purpose. We prefer Berman's bill -- HR 669 -- which simply 
would ban the import, resale and possession of all assault weapons. 
Metzenbaum's measure -- S386 -- also would forbid the import of new assault 
weapons, but would require that those now in private hands be registered. If 
the registered guns are resold, the purchaser would have to undergo the sort of 
rigorous background check now required on buyers of machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
Decades ago, Congress, concerned about declining migratory waterfowl 
populations, voted to require hunters using semiautomatic and pump shotguns to 
plug their magazines so they would hold no more than three shells. It is time 
for this government to demonstrate that it has as least as much concern for 
people as it does for ducks.

MENTAL-HEALTH FUNDING IS ALREADY ANEMIC; BLEEDING IT FURTHER WOULD BE LETHAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ROTHMAN, Jack Rothman is a professor at the UCLA School of Social 
Welfare. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian's proposed budget calls for a $23- million cut in mental-health 
funds. This would close all but a handful of community mental-health centers 
and wipe out psychiatric services for all but the most grossly impaired. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has encountered California's fast-growing population of the homeless 
mentally disturbed -- and who has not? -- would see the folly in such a 
proposal. It is obvious that we need more mental-health services, not less. 
Unfortunately, it took the slaying of a counselor, allegedly by a client, in 
her Santa Monica office, to focus public attention on the inadequacies of the 
mental-health structure in our state. How can we even think of cutting it back? 
</P>
<P>
The present situation grew out of good intentions. In the 1960s and '70s, the 
deinstitutionalization of many of the state's mental patients was touted as a 
humane way to help them and to reduce costs. The people of California were 
promised that the mentally ill would continue to receive out-patient care in 
the community, and not just be turned out on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Now the political powers that be are planning to eliminate even the community 
services for all but the most severe cases. Don't they realize that they are 
talking about human beings whose problems cause them intense emotional pain? 
Don't they understand that mental illness very often is an up-and-down problem 
-- that the tractable patient of today may exhibit disturbing (or worse) 
behavior tomorrow if not given steady support? 
</P>
<P>
Even without the proposed cuts and closings, mental-health services are none 
too great. The UCLA Center for Child and Family Policy Studies recently 
surveyed 48 mental-health service providers at the Los Angeles County Mental 
Health Department. They reported serious job stress caused largely by heavy 
caseloads and inadequate funding. Many complained that their work was always in 
a state of flux, and that high turnover resulted in constant policy shifts, 
leaving the staff off balance. A common feeling among the social workers is 
that priorities like "Star Wars" or the Contras are gobbling up federal funds 
that would otherwise be available for essential mental-health services. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that facilities and backup support for staff were 
wanting. Social workers said that in some locations there was not enough 
privacy or space to do group therapy, and that drab, dreary surroundings 
reduced morale. And they complained that responsibility for financial scrutiny 
cut deeply into time available for clients' problems. The issue of paper work, 
forms and red tape came up time and time again in the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers also noted that they were called on to do a lot more for their 
clients than simply talk them through their mental and emotional problems. They 
had to find help for them in a wide range of services -- vocational training, 
public assistance, legal aid, recreational opportunities, medical treatment. 
Many patients are incapable of negotiating these supports on their own. Yet 
community agencies are just as likely to turn a deaf ear to the mentally ill as 
to extend a welcoming hand. Some have long waiting lists. Others are 
understaffed. Most have experienced severe cuts in funding. 
</P>
<P>
So the Mental Health Department is not the only agency plagued by a funding 
deficit. Resources are inadequate for a variety of services needed as backup by 
social workers in their efforts to keep their patients psychologically stable. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers pointed to a lack of facilities for those clients with dual 
diagnoses, such as those who are mentally ill and also have chemical 
dependencies. Other multiple-problem situations include mental illness combined 
with illegal alien status, homelessness of women with children and so forth. 
One respondent stated, "It's completely impossible to find placement for people 
with double diagnoses. A mentally ill person with AIDS, for instance, no one 
will touch." 
</P>
<P>
As mental-health workers struggle to cope with these failures in funding for 
human services, the condition of a client can deteriorate or even explode. The 
community instinctively reacts with horror when news of something like the 
brutal murder in Santa Monica is broadcast. But, of course, the ultimate 
decisions about funding and policy for mental-health services are firmly in the 
hands of the public. If the public is alarmed, the time to speak out is now. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of the proposed budget cuts could be felt by every member of 
the community, not just the mentally ill. Cuts almost certainly will mean more 
homelessness and more "acting out" behavior on the part of society's troubled. 
</P>
<P>
With current rates of family violence and drug abuse already disturbingly high, 
does it make sense to diminish the mental-health resources that aim at 
ameliorating these problems? 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, funding must be found to preserve the semblance of a 
mental-health system that the state and county now have. Then, mental-health 
services should be built up until the promises of community care made decades 
ago are fulfilled.

PANEL TO SCRUTINIZE PURCHASE OF PARTS FOR C-5B CARGO JET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Air Force analyst reported last year that she had found a number of "horror 
stories" at Lockheed when she looked into an unusual $68.6-million program to 
buy spare parts for the sole purpose of fixing C-5B cargo jets if they should 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
A congressional hearing today will look into whether the concept of Air Force 
purchase of the so-called crash damage kits was justified and why so many of 
the parts were priced so high. One Air Force review found that 39% of a sample 
of the parts failed an "intrinsic value test." 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about our culpability and possible ramifications if this buy 
ever becomes public," Air Force cost/price analyst Capt. Kathy L. Johnson wrote 
in a report dated June 8, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials in the Pentagon and Lockheed officials denied Tuesday that 
the program was unjustified or that the parts were overpriced. Indeed, they 
said, such crash damage kits have been purchased for other aircraft and have 
proved helpful in keeping the planes operating. 
</P>
<P>
The House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations hearing will take testimony today from Assistant Air Force 
Secretary Daniel Rak and Maj. Gen. Richard D. Smith. The subcommittee is 
chaired by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force first looked into buying the crash damage kits in 1983, following 
two accidents that damaged C-5s. In late 1986 and early 1987, the Air Logistics 
Command, which procures spare parts for various flying units in the Air Force, 
issued two orders to Lockheed for 65 crash damage kits. 
</P>
<P>
The orders were unpriced but carried a combined "not-to-exceed" price of $68.6 
million. Each kit consisted of about 6,500 items, including structural parts, 
washers, fasteners and shims. 
</P>
<P>
But starting in mid-1988, the Air Force began to review the program amid 
growing concern that the program was a potential embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the Air Force analyst, wrote in a report in June, 1988, that the 
prices seemed "fair and reasonable" under a technical Air Force pricing system 
but that she considered them to be "in most cases exorbitant." 
</P>
<P>
According to her report, a pin was priced at $30.99, a pulley at $891.77 and a 
splice plate at $1,591.37. 
</P>
<P>
The next month, the Air Force comptroller, Lt. Gen. Claudius E. Watts, 
advocated a stop-work order on the kits, pending a review. 
</P>
<P>
"Progress payments cannot be properly administered, since neither the 
government nor the contractor knows precisely what is being procured and it is 
impossible to evaluate the contractor's physical progress," Watts wrote in a 
memo last July to Asst. Secretary of the Air Force John J. Welch. 
</P>
<P>
Still later, other Air Force officials were concerned about a public relations 
battle with Dingell. Eric Thorson, acting assistant secretary of the Air Force, 
cited figures provided by the Air Force Systems Command indicating that 39% of 
the items reviewed in the Lockheed program "failed the intrinsic value test," 
indicating that they were overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Justification' 
</P>
<P>
"If that model holds up, approximately 6,000 parts will be potential toilet 
pans for Mr. Dingell to hold up in a hearing," Thorson wrote in a memo to Rak 
last year. The reference was to Lockheed-produced aircraft toilet pans, costing 
$640 each, that were widely criticized as overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Stockton, a staff member of the oversight and investigations 
subcommittee, said, "There is no justification whatsoever. There is a C-5 at 
Travis Air Force Base right now with a 40-foot-hole in its top that the Air 
Force can't afford to fix, because it is wasting its money on crash damage 
kits." 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force spokesman said Johnson's report was being taken "out of context" 
and was intended to prevent potential abuses that the subcommittee is now 
alleging actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations earlier this month 
began an investigation of the colonel who was in charge of buying the spare 
parts. He was identified by the subcommittee staff as retired Col. Anthony F. 
DiFerdinando. 
</P>
<P>
DiFerdinando applied for a job at Lockheed when he was involved in the spare 
parts program, according to a General Accounting Office report to be released 
today. The colonel eventually accepted a job at Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Richard Martin said the company obeyed all federal 
regulations when it hired DiFerdinando and assigned him to work that is not 
related to his former government responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO investigation found that DiFerdinando had gone to Lockheed in June, 
1986, to review Lockheed's work on the kits about two weeks after submitting an 
employment application to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Although the GAO said it did not find any evidence that DiFerdinando's actions 
in the C-5B crash kit program were influenced by his potential Lockheed 
employment, it said he did not comply with reporting requirements and had 
failed to disqualify himself from the program as required after making his 
employment application.

UNCERTAIN ROAD FOR U-HAUL; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE FOUGHT FOR CONTROL WITH FISTS AND LAWSUITS. NOW, FOUNDING 
FATHER LEONARD SHOEN SAYS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Shoen, founder of the U-Haul truck-and-trailer-leasing empire, said he 
realized just how bitter his family's feud had become when he saw his sons 
taunt, grab and finally punch each other recently at the company's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
After reflecting on the rancorous meeting, Shoen said, he has abandoned a 
proposal under which all 12 of his children would serve on the company's board 
of directors instead of just four of his sons. Shoen had hoped that his plan 
would end a bitter rivalry that has pitted brother against brother and -- at 
times -- forced him to choose sides. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the next generation of Shoens will retain control of U-Haul 
or whether it is time for the family to let go. 
</P>
<P>
"I have now come to the conclusion," Shoen said in an interview, "that the 
company must be sold -- that's the only way to stop the animosity. I don't know 
how it could be solved any other way. I don't want this (fighting) to go on for 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
The battle for control of U-Haul involves the kind of vitriol and family 
backbiting common in episodes of television's "Dallas" and "Dynasty." On one 
side is former U-Haul President Samuel W. Shoen, who said he was hit by one his 
brothers at the annual meeting March 4 in Reno. On the other side is Edward J. 
(Joe) Shoen, chairman of Amerco, U-Haul's parent company. Both have allies 
among their siblings and have sued each other in federal and state courts. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the destiny of one of America's most visible companies. Founded by 
Leonard Shoen in 1945, the firm now has nearly 100,000 trailers and 60,000 
trucks -- all bearing the orange logo that has made the U-Haul name synonymous 
with do-it-yourself moving. 
</P>
<P>
Headquartered in Phoenix, U-Haul has 1,100 rental centers, 7,000 independent 
agents, about $800 million in annual sales and -- along with its major 
competitor, Miami-based Ryder System -- dominates the field of truck and 
trailer leasing in the United States. The company has had an impressive 
earnings rebound since a dip in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But U-Haul has an uncertain road ahead. The leasing market could change, 
analysts say, And courts may ultimately decide which faction will control the 
corporate board that steers the closely held company. 
</P>
<P>
The faction led by Dr. Sam Shoen -- members call themselves "outsiders" -- have 
filed a lawsuit challenging an Amerco board decision last July to issue 8,099 
new shares of company stock and sell them to five top executives under a 
special "Key Employee Stock Plan." The suit accuses the board of issuing the 
shares, which diluted the value of other stock, in order to protect and 
entrench itself. 
</P>
<P>
The outsiders controlled about 51% of the stock before the sale but just 47% 
afterward. The insiders -- four Shoen brothers, a sister and the five 
executives -- obtained a combined controlling interest of slightly more than 
50% as a result of the deal, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says Joe Shoen and the board sold the 8,099 new shares to the 
executives after Leonard, Sam and six other siblings banded together and 
expressed interest in the possibility of selling the company. Leonard and Sam 
said they wanted the board to at least consider a $1-billion buyout offer from 
another company. The seven also called for representation on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Amerco's board) bootstrapped themselves into a majority position by 
selling the stock," said Sam, a physician who resigned as president of U-Haul 
in 1987 after disagreements with Joe. "If this is not illegal, any board could 
issue stock to any party and lock themselves into a safe position." 
</P>
<P>
However, Joe Shoen's "inside" faction contends that its actions were legal and 
that they were taken to preempt a possible takeover. The board cites a series 
of Sam Shoen's activities, beginning in 1987, and characterizes them as secret 
efforts that could have led to the sale of U-Haul. As a result, when the board 
approved the plan to issue stock to the five executives it believed that "Dr. 
Sam and the dissident plaintiff shareholders were in the final stages of 
carrying out their hostile takeover/sale of the company," it said in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The factions confronted each other in January in an Arizona court that ruled 
against a request by Sam Shoen and his "outsiders" for a temporary restraining 
order on the contested sale of the stock. A trial on the legality of the 
transaction is still pending. The factions met again at the March 4 annual 
meeting that ended in violence, according to some witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
However, the animosity between the two groups appears to involve more than 
conflicts over who runs the company. Some of the trouble stems from differences 
over the company's strategy, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The marketing strategy began to change dramatically after the 1973 energy 
crisis led to the closing of many gas stations that operated as U-Haul dealers, 
prompting Leonard Shoen to open stand-alone outlets. The company also began to 
diversify, renting everything from motorized surfboards to videocassette tape 
players, besides its traditional trucks and trailers. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose -- reaching $799 million in 1987. But profit fell. Burdened by 
debt from its diversification and losing ground on the truck-rental front to 
rival Ryder, U-Haul recorded only $2 million in net income that year, compared 
to $42 million three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The family schism began when Joe began reversing U-Haul's direction shortly 
after Leonard -- pressured by some family members to retire -- stepped down in 
1986. Joe established a "back-to-basics" program which, among other things, 
eliminated the surfboards. For the nine months ending Dec. 31, the company 
reported revenue of $664 million and net profit of $46 million, Gary Horton, 
U-Haul's treasurer, said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Regained Lead 
</P>
<P>
"We're very sound financially, and things are on an upswing," he said. "It's a 
result of getting back to basics and doing what we do best." 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence has impressed some analysts. After allowing Ryder to pull even, 
U-Haul has regained a slight lead in the truck and trailer rental market, 
according to John Lenckos, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has turned things around," Lenckos said. "But any lawsuit takes 
management somewhat away from day-to-day operations. And this is no exception." 
</P>
<P>
Graeme Anne Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston, sees another possible 
problem -- a drop in demand for truck and trailer rentals, which thrive on job 
movement prompted by periodic rises in unemployment. If the nation's economic 
expansion and the resulting low unemployment continue, demand for trucks and 
trailers could slacken, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have excess capacity -- reflecting the growth of Ryder and U-Haul -- and 
signs of a sloppiness in demand," she said. "Rental companies may have to 
change their strategies." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Shoen, who calls the back-to-basics strategy shortsighted, still 
believes in his diversification plan and says it was designed to keep the 
company healthy in a changing economy. 
</P>
<P>
But he no longer wants to struggle over strategy, saying: "I've concluded that 
the company must go."

TALK OF INTEREST BY BASS BOOSTS TIME'S STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The price of Time Inc. shares surged $7.75 in active trading Tuesday, following 
a published report that the Robert M. Bass Group has accumulated a 2% stake and 
is considering making an offer for the publishing giant. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, however, a Time official said that Bass is not expected to mount 
a hostile bid. "That's our very strong view," the executive said. "Whether they 
have a stock position or not, the final (point is) . . . there is nothing going 
on." He would not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
A Bass spokesman would not comment on the story, which appeared in Tuesday's 
editions of the Wall Street Journal. The Bass group has been buying shares 
since Time early this month announced plans to merge with Warner 
Communications, the Journal said. The article said this reflected "an apparent 
belief by Bass that the proposed Time-Warner merger is a bad deal for Time's 
shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
The Time-Warner agreement has been widely viewed as a coup for Warner Chairman 
Steven J. Ross because Warner shareholders will end up owning about 60% of the 
combined company. Since the proposal calls for an exchange of stock, some 
investors have speculated that new bidders -- with cash -- might fight for 
control of either Time or Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Time and Warner have already taken one step to discourage an unfriendly bid, 
however. On the authority of each company's board of directors, Warner has sold 
10% of its stock to Time and Time has sold a 12.5% stake to Warner. 
</P>
<P>
The full merger cannot be consummated until federal regulators review the plan 
for antitrust implications and it is put to a shareholders' vote -- perhaps not 
before summer. 
</P>
<P>
Any overt show of interest on the part of the Robert M. Bass group seemed 
certain to spur speculative trading. Bass, 41, is the third of four Bass 
brothers who inherited much of the Texas oil fortune amassed by Sid Richardson, 
their great-uncle. As recently as 1984, Robert Bass operated in the shadow of 
his eldest brother, Sid, in investments such as Walt Disney Co., but Robert has 
since pursued media investments on his own. An investment in Taft Broadcasting, 
for example, resulted in a $1.45-billion restructuring of the Cincinnati 
broadcasting and entertainment concern. 
</P>
<P>
The Robert Bass group last year touched off a four-months-long bidding war for 
Macmillan Inc., but withdrew a $2-billion offer after Maxwell Communication 
Corp. made a significantly higher bid for the New York information services 
company. More recently, Bass acquired 40% of the voting stock of the closely 
held Times Publishing Co., which owns the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times and 
Congressional Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, the price of Time Inc. shares made the seventh 
greatest gain by percentage, closing at $119 a share.

HIGH COURT SNAGS BUSH S&amp;L PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
RULING ALLOWS CREDITORS TO BYPASS BAILOUT AGENCY AND SUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a setback for the Bush Administration's effort to quickly resolve the 
savings and loan industry crisis, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that 
creditors of failed institutions may bypass the federal bailout agency and take 
their claims to a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The result could be a series of protracted and costly rounds of litigation, 
just what government officials had hoped to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has sought to take over failed 
institutions, resolve the outstanding claims against them and then close their 
doors or sell them. 
</P>
<P>
But in a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court said the FSLIC does not have the 
legal authority to force creditors of failed S&amp;Ls to bring their claims 
directly to it for resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress granted FSLIC various powers in its capacity as receiver (of failed 
S&amp;Ls), but they do not include the power to adjudicate creditors' claims," 
said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor for the court. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, O'Connor said, the government agency would be acting both as owner 
of the failed S&amp;L and as judge of claims against it. Every dollar denied a 
creditor would be a dollar saved by the government, O'Connor held, a conflict 
of interest that "raises serious constitutional difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Change Rules 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor suggested that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the parent agency of 
the FSLIC, could rewrite its rules to require creditors to give it a "notice of 
all claims" outstanding and "an initial opportunity to consider them in a 
centralized claims process." 
</P>
<P>
"If the bank board's regulations only required claimants to give FSLIC notice 
of their claims and then to wait for a reasonable period of time before filing 
suit while the FSLIC decides whether to pay, settle or disallow the claim, we 
have no doubt that such regulations would be a reasonable exercise of the bank 
board's broad rule-making power," O'Connor wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Nichols, director of litigation for the bank board, said the court 
ruling "had good news and bad news for us." 
</P>
<P>
"It will be costly," she said, because 90 insolvent S&amp;Ls are administered 
by FSLIC, and their creditors now have the right to fight for their claims in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
But Nichols said O'Connor's opinion also shows how the problem can be resolved. 
If the agency had notice of all claims and a chance to resolve them quickly, 
she said, it could head off long court battles. 
</P>
<P>
Regional bank board officials had warned of the dangers of giving creditors the 
right to go to court. In briefs filed with the Supreme Court, officials of the 
Federal Home Loan Banks in San Francisco and Dallas warned that it "would 
significantly delay the liquidation of failed S&amp;Ls and add considerable 
expense to the cost of liquidation." 
</P>
<P>
But for Robert Goodfriend, a Dallas lawyer who represented a Texas real estate 
developer with a $113-million claim against an insolvent S&amp;L, the court 
ruling was strictly good news. "This is a real victory for creditors," 
Goodfriend said. 
</P>
<P>
Coit Independence Joint Venture, the real estate developer, took out a 
$50-million loan in 1983 with FirstSouth, an Arkansas S&amp;L. When the economy 
turned sour, the S&amp;L sought to impose higher interest on Coit and caused 
its development to fail, according to Coit's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
After the FSLIC took over FirstSouth, Coit's claims fell "into a black hole," 
Goodfriend said. Coit filed a suit in a federal court in Dallas, but the suit 
was dismissed on the grounds that only the FSLIC could handle its claims. The 
U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court reversed that outcome (Coit vs. FSLIC, 87-996) and told 
the federal court to hear Coit's claim for funds from FSLIC.

De Beers Raises Diamond Prices: The marketing arm of South Africa's De Beers 
Consolidated Mines, the Central Selling Organization, said it was raising its 
prices for rough gem diamonds by an average of 15.5%. The group, which sells 
the vast majority of the world's diamonds, said the increase reflects strong 
market conditions. The price increase, the fifth in three years, takes effect 
at the CSO's next sale, known as a "sight," on March 28. De Beers spokesman 
Andy Lamont said the market was helped by good demand from Japan, the 
second-largest retail diamond market after the United States.

Centel Sees $1.4-Billion Deal: Centel Corp. said it expects to sell its cable 
television division this month for more than $1.4 billion and use the proceeds 
to pay a special dividend to stockholders. Pressured by a takeover effort 
headed by investor Asher B. Edelman, the company said last year that it was 
planning to sell the cable unit and expand its telephone and cellular 
communications operations. Centel said it signed non-disclosure agreements with 
the bidders for its Centel Cable Television Co., of which it is the 82.4% 
owner, and declined to identify the parties. The company said it would pay its 
Class A shareholders a special cash dividend of $45.625 a share from the 
proceeds of the transaction, for which it expects to realize a $525-million net 
gain.

Bird curators depending on Eastern Airlines to fly rare Andean condor eggs to 
Los Angeles had to scramble for alternatives because of the machinists' strike. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern had been giving Miami's Metrozoo free tickets for an incubator and a 
zookeeper since the start of a project a year ago to save the related 
California condor from extinction. Only 28 of the huge California birds 
survive, all in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Three eggs were sent. But when a fourth egg was laid on Monday, Eastern was not 
flying to California, and other flights to the West Coast were heavily booked. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mess. We needed to get it out fast, the earlier the better," said 
bird curator Ron Johnson. "As the embryo grows, there is more chance of damage 
from movement." 
</P>
<P>
Metrozoo's Ellen Unger spent most of Monday trying to get an airline to fly a 
keeper with the one foot-high, cube-shaped incubator. 
</P>
<P>
Only Pan Am would even discuss the zoo's plight, Unger said. The airline agreed 
to give Metrozoo first-class tickets on an early morning flight today. 
</P>
<P>
The 6.6-ounce egg should hatch in about six weeks. If the bird is a female, it 
will be released on the cliffs in the Los Padres National Forest in about nine 
months and monitored by radio transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to find out about how Andean condors live before risking the 
California birds," Johnson said. After several years, some of the California 
condors will be released in areas the study indicated were safe.

OFFICIAL: LIMIT ON DEPOSIT INSURANCE MAY BE TOO HIGH

The $100,000 ceiling for insuring deposits in banks and thrifts may be too high 
and may have contributed to staggering losses in the savings and loan industry, 
a top federal banking regulator said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it ought to be looked at," Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger 
said in a speech to the National Law Institute, a group of banking and thrift 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The $100,000 insurance limit for each account is provided for deposits in banks 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and for thrifts by the Federal Savings 
and Loan Insurance Corp, although FSLIC is now technically bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Seger said that because the limit is so high some bankers who accepted large 
amounts of deposits may have invested them in risky ventures that led to 
insolvency for the bank or thrift and caused losses to the insurance funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Economic Advisers under then-President Ronald Reagan made a 
similar argument in January and said it may be necessary to lower the $100,000 
limit to discourage thrifts from making risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea was sharply criticized by members of Congress who received an 
assurance from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that he would not recommend 
such a change. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance limit was raised to $100,000 from $40,000 in 1980.

EASTERN SHUTTLE SHOULD LURE SEVERAL SUITORS, ANALYSTS SAY 
</P>

<P>
Eastern Airlines' lucrative shuttle service, for sale again, should attract a 
number of bidders, including most of the nation's major air carriers, industry 
analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of any of the majors and only Pan Am would be precluded from buying the 
service because it already has its own shuttle," said Robert Decker of Duff 
&amp; Phelps. "I would expect there will be plenty of bidders." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said it was seeking new buyers for the shuttle after real estate 
developer Donald J. Trump said Monday that he would not pay the $365 million he 
agreed to in October. 
</P>
<P>
Trump said a massive strike at Eastern, which has shut down most of the 
carrier, had made the shuttle, which links New York with Washington and Boston, 
worth a third less. He said he wanted to cut the purchase price by $125 million 
to $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is one of the few Eastern services still flying after the March 4 
strike of machinists, but it has seen a sharp fall in the number of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the shuttle is an attractive operation for a takeover 
because it functions essentially as an independent operation not dependent on 
traffic from other flights for business. 
</P>
<P>
"That means it could fit into almost anybody's system, although there are some 
complications with unions and the like," said Louis Marckesano of Janney 
Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Marckesano said carriers such as American Airlines, USAir, Trans World 
Airlines, United, Northwest and Delta likely would find the shuttle attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Decker said that, of those carriers, Delta and United have the lowest market 
share in New York and therefore might be most interested in the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Airlines, Eastern's sister in Texas Air, could try to buy the 
shuttle but might run into government opposition, Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's shuttle has been consistently profitable, Decker said, which enhances 
its marketability. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that capital constraints would be a consideration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts also said the shuttle was not worth the $365 million in cash that 
Trump had offered. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably between $310 million and $330 million would be a good price," 
Marckesano said. 
</P>
<P>
When Trump purchased the shuttle he seemed more interested in it as a way to 
advance his name than earn a huge profit on his investment. He said he would 
rename it the "Trump Shuttle" and would "run it like a jewel."

HEWLETT-PACKARD TO SELL ITS SOUTH AFRICA UNIT TO SILTEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard, one of a handful of large U.S. companies still operating in 
South Africa, said Tuesday that it would sell its subsidiary there to a South 
African holding company. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to Siltek Ltd. is only a partial withdrawal from the country; 
Hewlett-Packard products, largely computer systems and electronic 
instrumentation, will continue to be sold and serviced by Siltek. 
</P>
<P>
However, the move is a marked turnabout from Hewlett-Packard's posture on South 
Africa throughout the past half-decade. The company, known in California's 
Silicon Valley for its humanistic approach to business, remained a holdout in 
South Africa even as scores of U.S. companies bowed to shareholder and public 
pressure and pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard officials said the sale of its subsidiary was based on 
financial, not moral considerations. Because of its operations in South Africa, 
it has become increasingly difficult for the company to do business in the 
United States, where many cities, counties, school districts and even some 
states have passed laws prohibiting or severely limiting business with 
companies that still have South African ties. 
</P>
<P>
Its inability to bid on major municipal contracts has caused a "severe 
financial impact" amounting to "tens of millions of dollars on an annual 
basis," according to a company spokesman. Because its products will still be 
sold in South Africa, HP will continue to be barred from doing business with 
those governmental entities that have the most restrictive laws concerning 
firms with ties to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the estimated lost income stemming from its previous South African 
policy was beginning to outstrip the revenue generated by its subsidiary there, 
while its policy to work for change from within the South African system was 
losing its effectiveness, company officials conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking this action because we feel it will have a beneficial impact 
on bringing about the end of apartheid," the spokesman said. In fact, HP 
officials believe it will "be more difficult to engage in social programs 
without a presence there," despite the company's pledge to continue to fund 
social responsibility programs in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that so many other U.S. corporations have left the country has diluted 
the influence of the companies that chose to remain, the spokesman said. "We 
have had a modest impact, but we felt the collective efforts (of U.S. 
companies) could have an impact on apartheid. Now so many others have left . . 
. and the effectiveness of our own programs has been weakened, our ability to 
play a role (in changing the system) has been diminished." 
</P>
<P>
It was a "difficult" decision to leave, John A. Young, HP president and chief 
executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We consistently have said that HP would remain in South Africa as long as we 
could sustain an economically sound business, maintain our long-term 
commitments to South African customers and contribute, even in a limited way, 
to peaceful change and the creation of a more just and equitable society for 
all South Africans," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "increasing political and economic uncertainties have made 
it difficult for us to achieve these objectives. We are especially disappointed 
that there appears to be no significant progress in bringing about an end to 
apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout its 20 years in South Africa, sales there have generated less than 
1% of HP's total revenue. Last year, the company said, its South African 
subsidiary accounted for about $62 million in revenue. Total worldwide revenue 
last year was $9.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Siltek, an operating unit of Johannesburg-based conglomerate Anglovaal, will 
offer continued employment to HP's 245 South African employees, the company 
said. Other terms of the sale were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Its social programs, aimed at fostering change in the racially divided country, 
will continue to be supported through the Hewlett-Packard Foundation. Last 
year, through the HP Foundation and South African sales, HP distributed about 
$750,000 to the programs. 
</P>
<P>
HP's move comes less than a month after the latest of several successive 
attempts by shareholders to force the company's withdrawal from South Africa. 
At its Feb. 28 annual meeting, 77% of the company's shareholders voted against 
a resolution calling for a complete withdrawal from South Africa, including a 
halt to selling any merchandise in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard is the second U.S. corporation to pull out of South Africa this 
year after the departure of insurance company St. Paul Cos., according to the 
Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit group that tracks U.S. 
investment in South Africa. In the past five years, more than 130 U.S. 
companies have withdrawn.

EASTERN PILOTS ARE FAILING TO INSPECT JETS, UNION SAYS; AIRLINE DENIES CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Firing another salvo in the war between Eastern Airlines and its striking 
unions, the Air Line Pilots Assn. charged Tuesday that the few pilots who are 
reporting for work at Eastern are not performing proper safety inspections on 
their airliners. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern immediately responded by saying that since March 4, when the airline's 
machinists walked out, it had been operating under a microscope and that the 
allegations are untrue. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Eastern flight is being operated in strict accordance with regulations 
and very often under greater-than-normal Federal Aviation Administration 
observation," Robin Matell, an Eastern spokesman, said angrily. "The safety 
standards being applied at Eastern right now are the most rigid in the airline 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the pilots union, most of whom have not crossed the machinists' 
picket lines, have been monitoring Eastern flights from a ninth-floor motel 
room overlooking New York's LaGuardia Airport. Most of the flights that Eastern 
has been able to keep operating during the strike are using LaGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
ALPA said it has been conducting similar clandestine observations from hotels, 
campers and office and apartment buildings in various cities, including Miami 
and Atlanta. At LaGuardia, where the Eastern shuttle makes 62 flights daily, 
ALPA claims that there have been 1,100 violations since the strike began. 
Statistics for the other airports were not given. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, a subsidiary of the Texas Air holding company that also owns 
Continental Airlines, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on March 9, claiming that the walkout was causing 
large losses. 
</P>
<P>
The airline, which operated 1,040 flights a day before the strike, is flying 
only a skeleton schedule now. It is operating most of its 62 daily shuttle 
flights between New York and Washington and New York and Boston, as well as a 
few flights between Miami and Latin America and between Miami and New York. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots union says the pilots now working -- many from the ranks of Eastern 
management -- have not been conducting the preflight exterior inspections under 
and around the planes that federal regulations require. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been observing the takeoffs and landings (at LaGuardia) . . ., and we've 
noticed that the pilots weren't making the preflight inspections that the 
federal air regulations require them to," Henry A. Duffy, president of the 
pilots union, said Tuesday on CBS Television's "This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the strike started, there's been at LaGuardia something like 1,100 
arrivals and departures, and only four times did they observe preflight 
inspection being made. We've reported it to the Federal Aviation 
Administration, and they've done nothing about it." 
</P>
<P>
Such walk-around inspections are designed to find any damage done on a previous 
flight and include inspection of tires, nose wheels and landing lights. Damage 
from collisions with birds is a special concern. 
</P>
<P>
According to ALPA, the Eastern pilots' manual requires that the inspection be 
made by the flight engineer for planes with three crew members in the cockpit 
and by the pilot or co-pilot for two-person crews. As a result of the alleged 
infractions, Duffy said, proper provision for safety is "obviously" not being 
made by Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Ashby, an Eastern pilot and spokesman for the strikers, said the 
observations were being conducted 24 hours a day, using videotape and still 
cameras. The movement of every plane is being monitored, he added, and the 
surveillance is also identifying pilots who are not observing the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Stafford, an FAA spokesman, asked about safety at Eastern, said: "We 
are monitoring every Eastern flight." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was a controversy over whether a separate strike that began 
Monday by flight attendants at Continental, Eastern's sister airline, was a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Myra Clayton, a spokeswoman for Continental's Union of Flight Attendants, said 
1,207 attendants had not reported for work Monday, the first day of the 
walkout. Late Tuesday, she said she had reports from only two of Continental's 
major terminals: 132 attendants at Houston and another 130 at Newark had failed 
to show up for work Tuesday, she said. Many flights had been delayed, she said, 
adding that the airline had been putting incorrect information on flight 
information screens. 
</P>
<P>
But the airline disputed the union's claims. Continental Chairman D. Joseph 
Corr said only about 2% of the airline's 6,500 attendants (about 130) had not 
shown up for work and that Continental on Monday had completed 99.6% of its 
scheduled flights, most of which were on time within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Eastern proposed that both its union and its non-contract 
supervisory employees be represented on the committee of creditors scheduled to 
be formed this week as part of Chapter 11 proceedings. A hearing to set up the 
committee will be held today in New York. The airline said its unions should be 
represented "to assure that union interests are adequately represented in an 
efficient, orderly and less costly manner." It added that its 13,000 
non-contract workers and supervisors also deserve representation.

SLAIN GIRL'S FRIENDS MOURN IN SANTA ANA; COUNSELORS OFFER AID

The news came nearly 24 hours after 9-year-old Nadia Puente had been kidnaped, 
and it was horrifying: Nadia was dead; her strangled body had been found 
stuffed into a trash can. 
</P>
<P>
At the Girls Club of Santa Ana, a neighborhood gathering place where Nadia 
liked to go after classes at Diamond Elementary School, her friends met, talked 
and be gan to sob and cry. 
</P>
<P>
Soon they were talking with two Santa Ana Unified School District 
psychologists, dispatched from the school, where four psychologists had been 
standing by. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a great deal of crying, mourning a lost friend," said Lucinda 
Hundley, director of special education for Santa Ana Unified School District. 
"They wanted assurance of their own safety. They needed assurance that the 
school, the Girls Club, are safe places." 
</P>
<P>
Hundley has seen what such a tragedy can do to a community of parents and 
children that surrounds every elementary school. Two years ago, another 
9-year-old girl was murdered after leaving Monte Vista Elementary School, less 
than a mile from Diamond School. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 150 parents and children came to the school for counseling. 
</P>
<P>
After the discovery of Nadia's body Tuesday in a trash bin near Los Angeles' 
Griffith Park, Hundley spent the day preparing to offer the same kind of help 
to the community around Diamond School. 
</P>
<P>
Four psychologists will be at the school days and evenings this week to help 
individuals, families and groups cope with the mixture of emotions that arise 
after such a tragedy close to home. Interpreters for Spanish and Southeast 
Asian languages will also be there. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of parents want reassurance too," Hundley said. " 'Are the schools safe? 
Are the police doing something about it?' Many show anger: 'How could this 
happen to a child?' They're looking for an outlet for their anger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of things -- anger, disbelief, shock, grief. They want to 
know what to do if their child is sleepless or refuses to come to school." 
</P>
<P>
And children "don't react that much differently than adults," Hundley said. 
</P>
<P>
The psychologists will try to instruct teachers and parents what to look for in 
their children's behavior that indicates emotional fallout. 
</P>
<P>
If children become unusually excitable or unusually withdrawn, lose their 
appetites, become sleepless, cry excessively or have nightmares, these can all 
be danger signals. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes fact and fantasy get mixed up, and their imaginations work 
overtime," Hundley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hundley said she cannot predict what the community will need in reaction to 
Nadia Puente's murder. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule of thumb is to be prepared to move in when there is a need," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she said, teachers will reinforce what they have taught all 
along: Walk home with a buddy; and never, never enter a stranger's car.

Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs has offered Margo Adams $20,000 to settle her 
lawsuit against him, reversing his refusal to negotiate with his former lover. 
</P>
<P>
"I just did it for the welfare of the guys and to get the thing over with 
before the season starts," Boggs said in a story published in Wednesday's 
editions of the Boston Globe. "But there's no word on it (being accepted by 
Adams)." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer King, Boggs' lawyer in the suit, said that Boggs had been pressured by 
the Red Sox into making the offer to the Costa Mesa woman. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't something Wade wanted to do," King said. "The team put pressure on 
him. Teammates were concerned that depositions would be taken and they would 
have to talk about their private lives." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Gorman, Boston's general manager, denied that, telling the newspaper: "This 
is something Wade wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
James McGee, Adams' lawyer, said he expected to receive the offer in writing in 
the next few days. The Globe said Adams has told people that she has no 
intention of accepting the offer.

When Hugh Hewitt says drug testing isn't intrusive, isn't a big deal, doesn't 
interfere with your personal privacy, you kind of have to believe him. 
</P>
<P>
Okay, so Hewitt was general counsel in charge of drafting the federal 
government's main drug testing guidelines in 1986. That accounts for a bit of 
bias. 
</P>
<P>
But a month before he left public service for private law practice in Irvine 
and the directorship of the Nixon Foundation and Library, well, his number came 
up. So he headed for the lab and grabbed a beaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you from personal experience, it ain't intrusive," says Hewitt, 
whose urine was randomly tested in January when he was serving his last weeks 
as deputy director of the Office of Personnel Management. "I've been through it 
myself. It applies across the board. It's a good program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upheld by Supreme Court 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court upheld the government's right to test Customs 
Service employees seeking drug-enforcement jobs and struck down the National 
Treasury Employees Union challenge to the screening program. 
</P>
<P>
The Customs Service screening program -- the basis of Supreme Court decision -- 
was announced in May, 1986, and predates the guidelines fostered by Hewitt by a 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
But Hewitt sees the 5-4 decision validating testing as a vindication of his 
guidelines, which came into being when former President Reagan ordered the 
Office of Personnel Management to develop a strategy so every agency could test 
its workers for drugs where appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"If NTEU had won today, drug testing in the federal government would have been 
dead for all intents and purposes," Hewitt says. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says, the Supreme Court "has set down an analysis that every agency 
can employ to determine which of its employees may be subject to random drug 
testing." 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt headed a three-agency panel that wrote the government's screening guide 
in October and November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the first challenge has been met, "hundreds of thousands of people" in 
the bureaucratic ranks will be open to testing, Hewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Another upcoming drug-screening test case concerns the Department of Defense, 
which he said now wants to test workers who assemble hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classified Information 
</P>
<P>
In Hewitt's interpretation, "that's probably OK under this decision. The 
Supreme Court has approved (testing for) railroad workers, narcotics agents, 
people who carry firearms, and they have indicated that people who deal with 
classified information are probably able to be tested."

ABORTION FOES SHUT OUT IN DISPUTE WITH HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim hotel, threatened on two fronts in the abortion controversy, has 
refused to book accommodations for Operation Rescue, a New York-based 
anti-abortion group that plans to blockade several Southern California family 
planning clinics later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The general manager recognized they are a very controversial group and did 
receive a threat from another source saying if he let Operation Rescue people 
stay at the hotel, they had better tighten their security," said Mary Garcia, 
public relations manager for the Ramada Hotel Group in Phoenix, which holds the 
franchise for the Ramada Main Gate in Anaheim, across South Harbor Boulevard 
from Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"He recognized this as a potentially dangerous situation for the other guests 
in the hotel," Garcia said of the general manager's decision not to book 50 to 
100 rooms for the group. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jeff Adler, spokesman for the hotel, said the group was not welcome 
because its members did not meet standard hotel requirements to provide a list 
of names of those who would be staying and to pay a room deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Adler also said that members of Operation Rescue tried to intimidate the hotel 
management into providing facilities: "They threatened to take it to Time 
magazine unless we do as they say." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Anaheim facility's owner, Roger Manfred, Adler said: 
"This hotel will not be held hostage by any group." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Tanner, director for Operation Rescue's Southland activities, denounced the 
hotel's decision and called it "religious discrimination" at a press conference 
held in the hotel parking lot Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said about 500 anti-abortion protesters -- including Operation Rescue's 
founder, Randall Terry -- are arriving in the Southland from around the nation 
to participate in sit-ins at undisclosed clinics in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 of those were expected to need hotel rooms in Orange County, where 
nightly rallies will be held, he said. Operation Rescue has a temporary 
headquarters in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection by the hotel will not affect plans to block entrances of up to 
five clinics a day for 3 days, beginning Thursday morning, spokesmen for 
Operation Rescue said. 
</P>
<P>
The religious-based organization, which claims 20,000 arrests during scores of 
sit-ins nationwide over the past year, has created havoc in courts and jails in 
Atlanta and Sunnyvale in Santa Clara County. About 2,000 demonstrators are 
expected to participate in the sit-ins at Southland clinics, and hundreds of 
pro-choice activists have pledged to be on hand to defend the rights of women 
to obtain medical services. 
</P>
<P>
The "rescues" could begin as early as tonight at one clinic where, a spokesman 
for Operation Rescue said Tuesday, abortions are said to be performed 24 hours 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment locations for early morning "rescues" will be announced each 
night at Operation Rescue rallies held at 7 p.m. at Melodyland Christian 
Center, 400 W. Freedman Way, in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said Operation Rescue had planned to use the Ramada as a base during the 
protests and had reached an agreement Friday with the sales manager to provide 
rooms as available, an information table in the lobby and referral information 
to Operation Rescue followers who called from the airport. He said no deposit 
had been required. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday afternoon, he said his organization had received word that no 
rooms would be available. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said the sales manager confirmed that there had been a "political 
problem" about housing the group. 
</P>
<P>
"My question is -- and Randall Terry's question is -- can people be 
discriminated against based on their political and religious preferences?" 
Tanner asked. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group will seek to set up an information table in the Ramada 
parking lot to advise "rescuers" of other hotels available in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner speculated that a telephone threat may have come from someone who 
learned of Operation Rescue's plans to stay at the Ramada through the group's 
telephone hot line. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he suspects pressure was exerted on the hotel manager, from 
either an outsider who called the number or from someone within the hotel 
chain. "There must be a strong pro-abort community here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police said Tuesday that they have not been notified of any threats 
made against the hotel.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: MOTHER, DAUGHTER PLAN BIKE TRIP ACROSS U.S. FOR 
TOGETHERNESS, LUNG ASSN.

When Ellen Lowe, 42, decided to take a cross-country bicycle ride this summer, 
she first had to convince her husband and two of her three daughters that they 
could survive without her for 2 months. 
</P>
<P>
A more difficult problem was convincing herself that she could bicycle 3,359 
miles from Seattle to Atlantic City, N.J., and keep pace with her other 
daughter, 21-year-old Shelley Lowe of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
They plan to peddle an average of 80 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is another problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can handle it physically," said Ellen Lowe, 42, an accounts payable 
office supervisor in Walnut in easter Los Angeles County. "But getting sponsors 
is turning out to be a bigger challenge than I thought." Each wants to raise 
$5,000 for the American Lung Assn.'s cross-country ride, which is expected to 
attract 400 bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sponsors who have committed to as little as $1 and as much as $150," 
she said. "We ask everyone we talk to to help us out. We've worked with the 
Lung Assn. and have seen the great work it does." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from raising money, "I'm thrilled I'm going to do this with my mom," said 
her daughter, who works as a waitress and attends Cal State Fullerton. "We try 
to ride together three times a week. Our relationship is built around cycling." 
</P>
<P>
Before cycling, their main activity was running. "It was a good way to spend 
time together and I even thought of running a marathon," Shelley Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
The bicycling three times a week helped both progress to more challenging 
rides, such as the demanding 100-milers that each has taken. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first committed to the cross-country ride, it didn't sound as enormous 
as it is now," Shelley said. She said they are spending half their waking hours 
looking for sponsors and joining organized rides to better prepare themselves. 
"We're also learning how to eat more nutritiously for the ride." 
</P>
<P>
Bicycling gives Shelley "everything I need. I want to do something physical 
every day of my life and bicycling has everything I want, including speed and 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
And her mother likes to think it helps keep a family together. "In years past, 
families were closer. But today's families seem to be drifting apart. My family 
is close and I like to think that other families will get closer once again." 
</P>
<P>
She said cycling gave her the opportunity to see her eldest daughter on a 
regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"After she moved out I missed her a lot," she said. "And cycling gave us the 
opportunity to get together again." 
</P>
<P>
Besides their togetherness, the summer cross-country cycling trip will offer 
them the chance to see the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people traveling across the country are intent on their destination and 
miss what they are traveling through," said Ellen. "We're going to take it all 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Arash Alizadeh will graduate this year from Bolsa Grande High School in Garden 
Grove and plans to attend UCLA for a couple of years before moving on to 
Stanford. He wants to wait until he is old enough to get a driver's license. 
He's only 14. 
</P>
<P>
Arash moved with his parents from Tehran, Iran, to Westminster 2 1/2 years ago, 
learning English after arriving. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a problem communicating with people," Arash said, but added that 
he worked hard and was under a great deal of personal pressure to learn the 
language. "It was important to learn English to prepare me for the life I have 
ahead of me and to become a well-rounded person. I feel I do better under 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Arash said he wants to be a neurosurgeon and hopes someday to become the 
country's surgeon-general. "I plan to enter politics at a certain level," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to master schoolwork is not a matter of intelligence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have worked hard and I believe the culture I was raised in and the 
support of my mother and father has had a great deal to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Santa Ana's Valley High School won first place in drill team 
competition at the recent National Date Festival in Indio. The school also won 
second place for tall flags, a third for drum major and fifth for its marching 
band.

INVESTIGATION CONTINUES INTO CRASH LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investigation continued Tuesday into what caused a Piper Cherokee to lose 
power and crash-land in a Buena Park street shortly after takeoff from 
Fullerton Municipal Airport on Monday, city spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
A student pilot and his instructor walked away unhurt after their single-engine 
plane crash-landed after losing power at 400 feet and striking a utility line. 
Witnesses, who praised the pilot's evasive action, said the plane missed a home 
by about 50 feet and plowed through a white picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation 
Administration advised the city Tuesday that they are "sifting through 
everything" to determine what caused the plane's loss of power. 
</P>
<P>
Neither agency could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot John Otey, 30, of Anaheim, and instructor Mike Simmon, 21, of Norwalk, 
are both with Aviation Facilities Inc., of Fullerton, Buena Park police said. 
"They are not making any comments to the press," a company employee who 
answered the phone said.

TAX DISTRICT VOTED FOR NEW ANAHEIM HILLS TRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Anaheim City Council Tuesday approved formation of a new tax district for 
the Summit, the third of three giant planned communities in the east Anaheim 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The action, approved unanimously after a public hearing, will mean higher 
property taxes for future homeowners when they move in. The extra $8 million 
that would be raised by the Summit's tax supplement will be used to pay back 
bonds over the next 25 years for road improvements, a water reservoir and a 
police substation. 
</P>
<P>
Two other special tax districts were created last month for Sycamore Canyon and 
the Highlands. In all, more than 5,500 homes and condominiums are to be built 
in the three ranches in the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
So-called Mello-Roos tax districts such as these were made possible by a state 
law passed in 1982 as a way to circumvent the restrictions of Proposition 13, a 
measure that slashed local government's ability to raise money through property 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Summit homeowners will pay a tax rate of 1.36%, almost 50% higher than the 
prevailing Anaheim property tax rate of 1.05%. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Building Co., developers of the Summit, last month requested an 
extension of the council vote on the district to gain time to negotiate a 
better deal with the city. City officials this month agreed to add a $500,000 
water reservoir to the list of items paid for with the new tax money. 
</P>
<P>
A final council vote on forming the tax district is scheduled for April.

20 FLEE FIRE IN LAGUNA HOMELESS SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire caused $12,000 damage and gutted one room of a Laguna Beach homeless 
shelter Tuesday, but there were no injuries thanks to smoke detectors and the 
help of an off-duty police officer and one of the shelter's staff members, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified off-duty officer helped evacuate some of the 20 men and women 
from the Friendship Shelter for the homeless, Laguna Beach Deputy Fire Chief 
Rich Dewberry said. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Graves, a staff worker at the shelter, alerted one sleeping resident, who 
was safely evacuated, Dewberry said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out about 12:30 p.m. at the shelter in the 1300 block of South 
Coast Highway, but it was quickly brought under control by firefighters, 
Dewberry said. There was heavy smoke damage to the building's second floor. 
</P>
<P>
Occupants were alerted by smoke detectors that sounded the alarm when the fire 
broke out, Dewberry said. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the blaze remained under investigation. Occupants returned to the 
shelter for the night after Fire Department officials pronounced the building 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all still here," said David Peck, the shelter's night supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross provided replacement 
clothing for those whose clothes were damaged in the fire, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter is operated by Friendship Shelter Inc., a nonprofit organization 
that is buying the building, Peck said. It houses 20 residents, 14 men and 6 
women.

A substance called "chromium picolinate" could offer athletes a safe 
alternative to anabolic steroids, according to Gary Evans, a chemistry 
professor at Bemidji State University in Minnesota. He discussed the possible 
benefits of the nutrient during a meeting of the Federation of the American 
Societies for Experimental Biology at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Two studies at Bemidji State found that the compound helped promote muscle 
tissue and decreased body fat, he said. In one study, football players on the 
same exercise programs took either chromium picolinate or a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
Those taking the chromium picolinate showed an average 42% greater growth in 
lean body mass and a 22% drop in total body fat, compared to a 1.06% drop for 
the control group, he said.

TITANS GET CHANCE TO MEASURE SOFTBALL SUCCESS

<P>
All that's at stake for the Cal State Fullerton softball team this weekend in 
the eighth annual Pony tournament is pride and rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Fullerton (19-4) has won the tournament final five times, or 
that nine of the top 20 and five of the top seven teams in the nation are 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, which starts tonight at 5 and continues through Sunday's 2 p.m. 
final, is merely a test against some of the best the nation has to offer -- a 
yardstick to measure the Titans' chances in the tough Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it the mini-nationals," Fullerton Coach Judi Garman said. "But it's 
just for prestige and national rankings." 
</P>
<P>
The 16-team tournament begins with pool play today and Thursday. The Titans 
play Texas A&amp;M tonight at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the toughest of four pools contains third-ranked Oklahoma State, 
10th-ranked Arizona, the defending champion, No. 11 Cal State Long Beach and 
No. 20 United States International. 
</P>
<P>
Only second-ranked UCLA is absent from the top five ranked teams, which include 
No. 1 Fresno State and No. 4 Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for our conference teams to do well," Garman said. "It's 
important for our conference teams to beat the Pac-10 teams so we can show our 
strength." 
</P>
<P>
Of the five Big West teams in the tournament -- Fresno State, Fullerton, 
seventh-ranked Cal Poly Pomona, Long Beach and New Mexico State -- only New 
Mexico State is unranked. 
</P>
<P>
All three Pacific 10 teams -- Arizona, Oregon and No. 14 California -- are 
ranked. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal will be without Michele Granger, the former Valencia High standout who 
has had problems with swelling in her pitching hand. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will not face a ranked team in pool play, but will play traditional 
rival Texas A&amp;M. Also in Fullerton's pool are Akron, which Garman calls the 
sleeper team, and Utah, which earlier this season eliminated the Titans from 
the Arizona tournament, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans were eliminated in the early going of last year's Pony tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We really do get up for this tournament," Garman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think we can come back and win it this year." 
</P>
<P>
The men's gymnastics team seems to have a big task ahead with the Pacific-10 
championships this weekend at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Dick Wolfe, whose Titans will take on four of the top 20 teams in the 
nation, said Fullerton doesn't get the respect it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Cal State Fullerton is not even considered to be in competition," Wolfe said. 
"We have been in the top 20 a couple of times, but we have had problems with 
injuries and sickness. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend we put it all together. I would have to say we jumped from about 
25th in the nation to 11th or 12th." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton lost at Cal, 281.15-279.5, on Saturday but the high score helped pull 
up the Titans' average. 
</P>
<P>
With a similar score at the Pac-10 championships, the Titans could raise their 
average from about 261 to 274. 
</P>
<P>
Ranking is based upon a team's five best scores, with at least three of those 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are starting to come around," Wolfe said. "I'm real optimistic about 
what we are about to do." 
</P>
<P>
Eli Rodriguez is expected to finish high for the Titans in the all-around this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball team makes another trip east, playing Florida State in a 
three-game series this weekend and South Alabama on Monday and Tuesday. It's 
the Titans' first trip to the South since they swept through the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. South Regional last season in Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, winners of seven games in a row, are one game ahead of the pace of 
last year's team, which finished 43-18 and was one victory away from playing 
for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton opens Big West play March 31 against Pacific at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
Huck Flener was named Big West Conference pitcher of the week after winning two 
games, allowing six hits and striking out 19 in 14 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Flener, who has emerged as the Titan ace, struck out 15 in a complete-game 2-1 
victory over San Diego State and allowed two runs and three hits in three 
innings to earn the decision in a 7-3 victory over Gonzaga on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Flener, a left-handed sophomore, improved his record to 6-0 while lowering his 
earned-run average to 2.58.

ORANGE COUNTY BANKS RACK UP ROBUST EARNINGS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST SUCCESSIVE YEARS OF PROFITS SINCE DEREGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's 39 banks posted a combined net income of $41.4 million last 
year, giving the local industry successive years of profits for the first time 
since deregulation in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings were spurred by such factors as a robust economy, higher profit 
margins and fewer bad loans and write-offs, bankers and industry consultants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings are 54% higher than the aggregate $26.8-million profit posted by 
the county's banking industry in 1987, according to figures compiled by Gerry 
Findley, an industry consultant in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Last Year's Results Were the Best' 
</P>
<P>
"Last year's results were the best that I've ever seen," said Findley, who has 
been tracking the performance of the state's banks since 1968 and has been 
consulting for banks since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
No statewide figures are available yet, but the 13,200 banks in the United 
States earned a record $25.3 billion last year, despite a post-Depression 
record of bank failures, primarily in Texas and other economically strapped oil 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for the county's banks, however, was tempered with a warning from 
Findley and others in the industry that banks will find it tougher to make a 
buck this year. 
</P>
<P>
Competition is driving up interest rates paid on deposits, for instance, 
narrowing the profit margins most banks enjoyed through much of last year. And 
rising interest rates may also slow the economy and lead the country into a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
The high profits are also creating shareholder pressure to pay out cash 
dividends, said Findley and Edward Carpenter, a Costa Mesa consultant for 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plowing Earnings Back for Growth 
</P>
<P>
Many independent banks have been plowing earnings back into operations to 
foster future growth and to attract buyers at higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Banks that aren't brides (in mergers and acquisitions) are going to face 
shareholders who want yields on their investments," Carpenter said. "There's 
nothing worse than hopes unfulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
Findley said he is advising his healthier clients to start paying cash 
dividends. Last year, just five banks -- Eldorado, Com- merceBank, Orange 
National, Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino -- paid regular cash 
dividends to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
But L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
recently chided banks for passing on more than half of their aggregate profits 
to stockholders and advised banks to adopt a more conservative approach. 
</P>
<P>
For most county banks, profits were churned out last year as never before, as 
these statistics compiled by Findley demonstrate: 
</P>
<P>
* Sixteen banks posted annual net incomes of $1 million or more last year. 
Twelve banks hit seven figures the previous year. Security Pacific State Bank 
in Irvine led the way last year, with $4.2 million in net income. 
</P>
<P>
* Just three banks lost money last year; seven were floating in red ink the 
previous year. The biggest money loser last year was Laguna Bank in Laguna 
Beach, which lost nearly $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
* The combined return on assets -- a key indicator of health -- was 1.05% last 
year, up from the previous year's return of 0.76%. Banks consider a 1% return 
to be very good. Colonial Bank, a 2-year-old institution formed from the ashes 
of the New City Bank failure, recorded a 3.87% return. Older banks -- Pioneer, 
Corporate and Mission Viejo National -- each had returns above 3%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Far Western Fell Back 
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Far Western Bank, which shot from $81 million in 
assets in 1986 to become the county's biggest bank in 1987, with $311.9 million 
in assets, fell back to $160 million in assets last year. 
</P>
<P>
The decline is a result of a change in operations. The bank had concentrated 
almost exclusively on buying auto loans made mostly by dealers, an activity 
that regulators questioned last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Far Western acts much as a mortgage banker, making and selling auto loans 
and earning money on loan fees and loan servicing fees, said David Watt, the 
bank's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The object is to curtail the bank's heavy loan losses, he said. Though Far 
Western earned $2.2 million last year, it also wrote off loan losses of $9.6 
million -- on top of $10.6 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Somebody Else's Portfolio' 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the regulators are happy to see the loans in somebody else's 
portfolio," Watt said. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial Center Bank in Santa Ana regained its position as the county's 
largest bank. As Westlands Bank, it had been the county's biggest bank in 1983, 
with $490 million in assets, but it fell on hard times and was bought in 1984 
by Canadian Commercial Bank of Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian bank, now in receivership, has been trying to sell Commercial 
Center, but no buyer has been willing to pay the $70.3 million that the Santa 
Ana bank had in capital at the start of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
So Commercial Center restructured its capital base last year to wind up with 
$45.3 million in capital at the end of December -- nearly three times what 
federal regulators require and probably still more than anyone is willing to 
pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Success -- for at Least 1st Half 
</P>
<P>
The county's banks should generally continue to enjoy success, at least for the 
first half of the year, said bankers J.B. Crowell and Philip S. Inglee. 
</P>
<P>
Inglee said he believes that banks are doing better so far this year than they 
ever have in the traditionally slow first quarter, but he and Crowell worry 
about what is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the nation's credit availability, 
has been raising interest rates to slow down the economy and avoid double-digit 
inflation. Still, wholesale prices rose 1% in January and again in February, 
the highest back-to-back increase since March and April of 1981, according to 
the U.S. Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell, president of Eldorado Bank in Tustin, said: "People still can afford 
homes, but if interest rates go above 12%, it makes it tougher for everybody to 
cover their borrowing costs. I just hope the Fed doesn't overdo it and choke us 
out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Times in Early '80s 
</P>
<P>
Banks went through tough times in the early 1980s as inflation boosted the 
prime rate -- which banks charge their best customers -- to 21.5%. Stuck with 
fixed-rate loans and overvalued property they took back in foreclosures, banks 
posted losses and began failing at rates not seen since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, 'Did we learn anything from the early 1980s?' " said Inglee, 
president of Liberty National Bank in Huntington Beach. "I think most banks 
will do OK if a recession comes. They have cut staffs back and become more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
"But it really depends on how tough it gets. There's really no reason to have a 
recession like we had in the early 1980s."

S.D. SOFTWARE FIRM ACQUIRED BY COMPETITOR

Education Systems Corp., a fast-growing education software company based in San 
Diego, will be acquired for about $64 million in stock by Jostens Inc. of 
Minneapolis, according to a definitive agreement announced by the companies 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A closely held company that has been selling computerized "teaching machines" 
for less than three years, Education Systems watched its sales grow to $22.4 
million in 1988 from $300,000 in 1986, president John Kernan said Tuesday. 
Revenue growth will slow somewhat this year with 1989 revenues projected at 
about $30 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly held Jostens said it is the nation's largest seller of class rings and 
yearbooks to high schools. The company also has a Phoenix-based education 
software unit called Prescription Learning that previously competed with 
Education Software but which now will be combined with it. Kernan will be 
chairman of the new business unit. 
</P>
<P>
Education Systems sells computer software and hardware in networked systems 
that are used in learning laboratories in elementary schools. The systems are 
used for remedial and supplemental education and sell for about $100,000 each. 
Education Systems' products are now in 800 schools, and Prescription Learning 
has installed systems in 2,500 schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jostens has not decided on a name or a headquarters location for the 
new combined business, Kernan said no layoffs or relocations are planned for 
Education Systems' 250 employees, 80% of whom are teachers or have graduate 
degrees. Relocations will be "minimal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jostens, which reported 1988 revenue of $560 million, will exchange 3.3 million 
of its shares for all outstanding shares of Education Systems, Jostens Chief 
Financial Officer Gerald Haugen said Tuesday. Using Jostens' closing stock 
price of $19.50 Tuesday, the deal would be worth a total of $64.4 million. The 
deal should be complete by May, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Education Systems stock is held by 150 of its employees and by a dozen venture 
capital firms, Kernan said. The two largest stockholders are Helix Investments 
of Toronto and BancBoston Ventures of Boston. Kernan, 43, who joined the 
company in September 1985, declined to disclose his stock holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Saul Yaari, managing director of research at Piper Jaffray Hopwood investment 
bankers in Minneapolis, said the dilutive effects of the deal will knock 4 
cents off his 1989 profit estimate of $1.42 a share for Jostens in 1989, Still, 
he described the acquisition as "positive" because it "increases the product 
offerings and marketing capabilities" of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
Kernan, who was brought aboard to head Education Systems's manegement by 
venture capitalists to help chart the company's growth, said the merger with 
Jostens was approved because of the "attractive price" and the opportunity to 
join forces with a respected competitor.

DataWorks of San Diego, a closely held publisher of business systems software 
for manufacturing companies, announced it has signed a marketing contract with 
NCR of Dayton, Ohio, that could generate $60 million more in sales for 
DataWorks over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement announced Tuesday, NCR will market its Tower 
computer system bundled with a DataWorks software package called Manufacturing 
Resource Planning, or MRP II. Total sales of computer systems are projected at 
$100 million over four years, of which 60% will flow to DataWorks, president 
Stuart W. Clifton said. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton described the potential market for the Tower computer system as about 
60,000 manufacturing companies with sales "from $3 million up to the Fortune 
500 level." DataWorks will be happy if 1% to 2% of that market buys the 
$250,000 Tower systems annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the contract, DataWorks plans to increase employment at its 
Sorrento Valley plant from 70 workers now to 150 by mid-1990 and to 250 in 
1993, Clifton said. Over that period, the company's annual sales should 
increase from $5.5 million last year to $30 million in 1993, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1977, DataWorks was acquired by Clifton and his partner, Mark 
Howlett, two years ago. CHRIS KRAUL

PENNY STOCK PROMOTER REPORTEDLY HELPING FRAUD INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French and Swiss investigators are receiving information from their U.S. 
counterparts as they try to unravel a penny stock fraud that bilked investors 
around the world out of as much as $500 million, according to sources familiar 
with the European investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the information comes from Arnold L. Kimmes, 67, a longtime penny stock 
promoter who is cooperating with a federal grand jury investigation in Las 
Vegas, said the sources, who spoke on the condition that their names be 
withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmes' penny-stock activities emanated in part from Chelsea Securities, a 
now-defunct Newport Beach brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmes is not cooperating directly with the foreign investigations, but some of 
his evidence is being relayed to Swiss and French investigators as a result of 
a formal request approved by the U.S. Justice Department, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
One target of the European investigators is Thomas F. Quinn, a convicted stock 
swindler and longtime associate of Kimmes, the sources said. Quinn has been 
held in a Paris jail since being arrested at his villa on the French Riviera 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmes, who has not been charged in the European scheme, left France shortly 
after Quinn's arrest and has been cooperating with U.S. authorities for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Robert M. Silverman, said Monday that Kimmes was not involved in 
the European operation allegedly run by Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kimmes was not involved in any stock operations with Mr. Quinn in Europe," 
Silverman said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Silverman declined to provide any further information or say whether Kimmes is 
being held in protective custody in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit filed in federal court in Denver late last year by an 
Internal Revenue Service agent, Kimmes has been providing information to 
federal investigators examining the growing problem of penny stock fraud in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Chelsea Securities, an Orange County brokerage used by Kimmes, shut down 
shortly after being raided by the IRS last September as part of the 
investigation, the affidavit said. Robert Killen, a former Chelsea owner, 
denied that the company engaged in any wrongdoing. Killen said the office was 
closed because it was not profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmes has acknowledged that Quinn played a role in advancing one of Kimmes' 
frauds in the United States in the mid-1980s, according to the IRS agent's 
affidavit. The agent said Kimmes also described how funds from his U.S. scheme 
were laundered by a Swiss middleman. 
</P>
<P>
The money laundering is apparently a key interest of European investigators. 
The sources close to the current U.S. inquiry said European investigators have 
had difficulty tracking millions of dollars lost by investors who bought highly 
overpriced stocks after sophisticated telephone pitches from salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, investigators and prosecutors from eight European countries and 
Australia attended a meeting in Washington organized by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the IRS and the FBI. The meeting was held to exchange 
information and coordinate the investigation of Quinn and several associates, 
according to a U.S. investigator who was involved.

NIGERIA REQUESTS ICN'S RIBAVIRIN TO COMBAT LASSA FEVER OUTBREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
ICN Pharmaceuticals has answered an emergency request to ship its antiviral 
drug ribavirin to Nigeria to combat an apparent outbreak of African Lassa 
fever, the Costa Mesa-based pharmaceutical company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to ICN, the request came from the Ministry of Health in Nigeria and 
was directed to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The recent outbreak has claimed several lives, according to the company. Lassa 
fever is caused by a virus and is characterized in its latter stages by 
vomiting, internal bleeding and high fever. 
</P>
<P>
Ribavirin, which is made by ICN, "is the only drug or compound that works 
against Lassa fever," said Jack Sholl, ICN's vice president, public relations. 
</P>
<P>
ICN has shipped about $100,000 worth of ribavirin to the Centers for Disease 
Control. The drug is to be taken from Atlanta to several sites in Nigeria, 
according to ICN. 
</P>
<P>
Ribavirin has been authorized for marketing in the United States under the 
trade name Virazole by ICN since 1986 to treat hospitalized infants with 
respiratory tract infections. The drug first was reported to be effective 
against Lassa fever in a study by the CDC published 3 years ago in a 
professional journal, the company said. MARY ANN GALANTE

ROAD TO REDEMPTION INCLUDES O.C. CONCERT; 
</P>
<P>
ERIC BURDON IS BATTLING THE BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As leader of the Animals, Eric Burdon pursued the sound and feeling of blues 
and R&amp;B authenticity more single-mindedly than almost any other star of the 
mid-'60s British rock invasion. 
</P>
<P>
That Burdon found what he was looking for is evident in those old Animals hits, 
many of them reworkings of blues and soul standards that helped lead American 
fans of the British rock phenomenon back to their own country's fertile musical 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a century after the Animals scored a No. 1 hit by breathing a 
fresh sense of dread and damnation into the old folk-blues "House of the Rising 
Sun," the blues are still very much with Burdon. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of fueling hit songs, Burdon's 1980s blues only reflect a deep 
sense of frustration bred from a series of balked attempts at reigniting his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"I live from one disaster to another," Burdon, who will be 48 next month, said 
by phone recently from Hollywood, where he was rehearsing his band for a 
national tour that brings him to the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can prove I'm worth anything is to get on the road and perform 
for live audiences. They let me know I'm still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a very happy story," he summed up. "I wish I could tell you a different 
one, but that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
Burdon's steady, gravelly tone didn't beg sympathy as he recounted a succession 
of recent career mishaps. Instead there was an edge to his reflections, a sense 
that time and trouble haven't subdued the smoldering assertiveness that Burdon 
brought to such Animals hits as "It's My Life," "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" 
and "We Gotta Get Out of This Place." 
</P>
<P>
Burdon's most concentrated effort at regaining the mass public's notice was a 
1986 autobiography, "I Used to Be an Animal, but I'm All Right Now." From what 
Burdon says about the book, though, it barely did appear. 
</P>
<P>
"My hopes were that people would read it and it would get to the marketplace. I 
feel filled with despair when I get continual phone calls and letters, requests 
from people on the road: 'I heard about your book, man. Where can I get it?' I 
don't even have a copy of it myself because I've given away every copy I had." 
</P>
<P>
(The British pressing of 10,000 copies sold out, according to Joanna Mackle, 
publicity director for the book's London-based publisher, Faber &amp; Faber. A 
spokeswoman in the publishing house's U.S. office said American sales are 
approaching 10,000 copies.) 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Burdon said, most of "I Used to Be an Animal" had disappeared 
before the book ever saw print. For that he blames Peter Townshend of the Who, 
the rock star who now and then puts down his guitar in favor of an editor's 
pencil at Faber &amp; Faber. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured with Pete Townshend at the helm I'd have a shot, (but he was) more 
like hatchet man than editor. You don't have to be connected to the literary 
world to see there are these leaps and gaps in it. I wrote 240,000 words, and 
200,000 words were thrown out the window."

The book is a disjointed, unsurprising narration of the usual '60s excesses of 
sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll, long on surface reminiscing but short on 
depth, detail, perspective or reflection. Burdon says that he wrote a complete 
life history, but that Townshend's cuts lopped off his story with the death of 
Burdon's friend, Jimi Hendrix, in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Missing, Burdon said, are such tidbits as the genesis of the Animals' name: It 
wasn't intended as a cute reference to the wild kingdom, he said, but as a 
tribute to a British World War II veteran, nicknamed Animal, whom Burdon had 
known as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the most engaging characters I'd ever met, but his mind was 
blown," Burdon said. "He raped a girl at gunpoint during the British occupation 
of Cypress, and after that he couldn't handle life anymore. It blew his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Townshend said, 'We can't print that. We might offend women readers.' I feel 
pretty bitter about it. (Townshend) did me a great disservice. He kept me boxed 
in the '60s, where I'm safe, not alive in the '80s at all." 
</P>
<P>
Burdon said he thinks that his lack of rapport with Townshend on the book 
project may have had its seeds in the '60s, when the Who were favorites of 
Britain's trendy, upscale Mods, while the Animals were more in league with the 
Mods' scruffier working-class antagonists, the Rockers. 
</P>
<P>
"(Townshend) was the vanguard of the Mods. I always considered myself a 
Rocker," said Burdon, the son of a Newcastle electrician. "Through the 
experience of the book, I came to realize we hadn't changed our stripes at 
all." Townshend, who handles book projects in between his musical endeavors, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Burdon's most recent attempt at '80s career revival was an album, "I Used to Be 
an Animal," geared to coincide with the book. Released last year on the obscure 
Striped Horse label (which Burdon said has since folded), it found Burdon in 
strong voice on energetic songs ranging from straightforward rock and R&amp;B 
to rap-flavored funk. The album, like the book, did a quick vanishing act. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't much interest" from bigger labels, Burdon said, "and that's why I 
went with an independent for the first time. It was the only choice I had at 
the time, and I'm still confronted with that problem. I hope this tour will 
open somebody's ears and get me another deal." Burdon said he has also 
continued to write, working on screenplays and a biography of Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Burdon moved to La Quinta, near Palm Springs, after sojourns in 
Spain and West Germany. He continues to tour with the same four-man backup 
group of London-based musicians that he has worked with for the last 3 years. 
West Germany remains one of his favorite stops. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one country where I feel appreciated," Burdon said. "The people allow me 
to keep a grip on the sort of reality I want to have for myself. I want to 
achieve the same thing here. This is the big challenge, the big country." 
</P>
<P>
In England, Burdon said, he has been a pariah since the early '70s, when he got 
in trouble after giving a stoned, emotional interview on the BBC following the 
death of Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
"The week Jimi died, that's the last time I played in England, except for guest 
appearances with the Animals. It's OK for me to be an Animal, but as Eric 
Burdon, I'm persona non grata. People in England talk to me like I'm the 
walking dead: 'Eric Burdon -- I thought you were dead.' My only answer is, 
'Come to one of my gigs and I'll show you whether I'm dead or not.' " 
</P>
<P>
Financially, at least, it would seem that Burdon could bring his career to life 
by reconvening the Animals and joining the lucrative rock oldies circuit (in 
his book, Burdon says that the first time 'round, business scams robbed the 
Animals of their earnings). 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather stay where I am and call my own shots and keep my own identity," he 
said. A 1983 reunion tour and album with the band's original lineup convinced 
him that, although he used to be an Animal, he had better avoid becoming one 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to do (the reunion) in the first place, but everyone from my 
lawyer to my mother was saying, 'Go on, give it a shot.' I figured, 'If you 
can't communicate with old friends, what's the use?' 
</P>
<P>
"But it was probably the worst experience of my life. By the time I got to 
America, we were trading blows physically. Whatever feelings I had for those 
guys were lost in that tour, and nothing's worth that." 
</P>
<P>
This leaves Burdon today in much the same position as some of the old blues 
figures he emulated as a young man: largely ignored but still gamely singing 
and playing, with memories of setbacks, disappointments and squandered 
opportunities as a constant reminder of just what the blues are about. 
</P>
<P>
Burdon takes that assessment as a compliment, not a sad irony. "When I run into 
those old blues cats and hear what they have to say . . . I'm quite proud to be 
judged that way." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Burdon plays at 8 tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San 
Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714) 496-8930.

'INSTALLATION' PIECES: THE MAIN RULE IS THERE ARE NO RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people would tell you that paint doesn't become a work of art until it is 
"tastefully" applied to canvas and that household furniture hardly qualifies as 
"real" sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
But a pair of exhibitions on view in two Orange County locations cheerfully 
ignore such traditional notions. Each is an "installation," a major phenomenon 
in the art of our time. Designed for specific sites, installations often 
include objects from daily life as well as recognized "art" media. Some 
installations have the exploratory quality of a science experiment. Others are 
ventures into improbable realms of the imagination. The main "rule" is that 
there are no rules: Any material, any amount of space or time, any idea -- 
however farfetched -- is fine and dandy so long as it creates its desired 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Mathieu Gregoire -- whose work is on view through June 18 in Costa Mesa at the 
South Coast Plaza annex of the Laguna Art Museum, makes very odd-looking 
sculptures that combine the no-nonsense skills of a carpenter with an 
idiosyncratic brand of logic. 
</P>
<P>
The sculptor from San Diego confounds normal ideas about what the inside or the 
outside of an object is, what shape is appropriate to its function and what 
function is appropriate to its shape. Curious slot-like openings abound in 
these pieces, offering a further puzzle-like quality to tease the viewer. 
Gregoire often presents two objects as a package for reasons that remain 
obscure. 
</P>
<P>
For "Partitions/Divider" -- which looks somewhat like a voting booth from the 
outside -- he upholstered two L-shaped lengths of particle board in white 
canvas, mounted them on steel legs and positioned the pieces inside each other 
with the fabric portions facing away from the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of space these "partitions" frame is just the few inches that exist 
between them, a tiny passageway too narrow for a person to walk through. The 
third component of the piece, a rectangular slab of black plexiglass attached 
to the wall with a metal bracket at roughly shoulder height, is equally odd: It 
"divides" nothing but air. 
</P>
<P>
"Deep Chair" is a rocking chair upholstered in a textured sea-foam green 
material that is locked in place by a sheet of plywood hung from the ceiling 
and carved out to accommodate the silhouette of the top of the chair. The wood 
emphasizes the depth of the chair and yet prevents viewers from sitting down 
and experiencing it for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Slot/Headboard" involves a tacit comparison between two elements set into the 
wall: an ornate vintage headboard in dark wood with an inlaid design and its 
brash echo, a plain, squared-off construction made of cheap wallboard with a 
slot running the length of its outer edge. 
</P>
<P>
This unlikely combo is just similar enough to suggest that points of comparison 
are in order. Well, you may say to yourself, the slot -- which has no apparent 
function -- might be the equivalent of the inlaid design on the headboard. Come 
to think of it, the slot also diverts attention to inside surfaces, as opposed 
to the external showiness of the finial-sporting headboard. 
</P>
<P>
Gregoire's sly agenda is not likely to charm those who like their art in 
familiar packages. But for those open to something new, there is a freshness 
and fantasy that clings to these odd works. They possess an anarchic 
spiritedness that suggests any answer is the right one so long as it gives you 
the feeling of having figured something out. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Cheng's work -- on view at the Rancho Santiago College Art Gallery in 
Santa Ana through April 6 -- is about raw materials and process. He's 
interested in such things as the way dripped paint looks as it hardens as well 
as the minute differences that occur when identical actions are repeated over 
time. He has said that it was difficult for him to be a painter because he was 
"always so fascinated with just the phenomenon of squeezing paint out of a 
tube." 
</P>
<P>
His installation, "Solid Rain," is part mechanical gadget, part 
work-in-progress. A paint-dripping apparatus is mounted on metal scaffolding 
affixed to two runners. Moving slowly from side to side as well as down the 
length of the runners, the machine deposits blobs of paint and wax on a grid of 
plexiglass squares on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
After this process has gone on for a while, each square begins to look like a 
miniature relief map. The artist's penciled notes on the wall next to the piece 
indicate the order in which the colors have been dripped and the landscape 
formations ("canal buildup," "volcanic buildup," "meteorite smash") that they 
resemble. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the day I saw the exhibit the equipment was out of order -- the 
heating mechanism had broken down, so the wax hardened and refused to drip out 
of the machine. But even granted the gee-whiz fascination of its working 
methods, the project seems essentially one-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the variables in the process (the paint colors, the amount of drip and 
so forth), once the little "landscapes" assume their basic form, the project 
acquires a certain rote predictability. The cumbersome aspect of the enterprise 
gets in the way of its experimental, stop-action quality, better revealed in 
some of Cheng's earlier works that are included in the show. 
</P>
<P>
In an untitled piece from 1964, he dripped light brown-colored plaster on a 
sheet of glass to form a rather blandly symmetrical pattern of shapes. Then he 
graduated to making "Paint Apparatuses," pristinely carpentered little wooden 
constructions with chutes and troughs that collected multicolored layers of 
paint that dried into stilled lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Cells," a series from the late '70s and early '80s, involved dripping 
blue paint and glue on wood with an eye-dropper to make small, viscous rounded 
forms, each tipped with a blue iris-like shape. Grouped in uneven grids 
straggling across pieces of paper, these little forms look somewhat like the 
results of a very patient student's biology-class experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbornly single-minded in his work, Cheng nevertheless is capable of both 
hermetic, small-scale pieces like "Blue Cells" and broadly accessible projects, 
like the swatch of sand on a Santa Monica beach that he imprinted last year 
with a raised pattern of Los Angeles sights ("Walk on L.A."). At the very 
least, visions like his and Gregoire's refresh the jaded eye and offer the kind 
of surprise and wonder that the much-vaunted "art experience" is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mathieu Gregoire: Sculpture" is on view through June 18 at the Laguna Art 
Museum's South Coast Plaza site, 3333 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. Hours are: 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Wednesday; 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday and Friday;

Cineplex Odeon Corp. said today that it has sold its 50% stake in Universal 
Studios Florida to pare the debt amassed to finance an aggressive expansion 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon said it will sell its interest in Universal 
Studios Florida to a U.S. subsidiary of the Rank Organization Plc for about 
$150 million. U.S. Universal Studios Florida, a joint venture between Cineplex 
Odeon and MCA Inc., is the largest state-of-the-art working motion picture and 
television studio facility outside of Hollywood. Cineplex Odeon has invested 
about $92 million to date in the venture, which was announced in 1986.

Women who smoke marijuana during pregnancy may stunt the growth of their 
fetuses, producing babies who are smaller than normal, according to a study 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
The research found that mothers who smoked pot while pregnant produced babies 
who averaged three ounces lighter and two-tenths of an inch shorter than 
non-users' newborns. Although their study does not definitely prove that 
marijuana slows growth in the womb, the researchers said pot-smoking is common 
during pregnancy and women should be cautioned about the link. The study also 
confirmed earlier reports showing that cocaine users produce unusually small 
babies.

SUSPECT SEIZED IN DEATH OF GIRL FOUND IN GRIFFITH PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 27-year-old Garden Grove man, who police say posed as a schoolteacher to lure 
a Santa Ana schoolgirl into his car, was arrested outside his home this morning 
on suspicion of the girl's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Gonzalez was taken into custody at 9:45 a.m. and was being 
questioned at the Santa Ana Police Department in connection with the abduction, 
sexual molestation and strangulation of 9-year-old Nadia Puente. Her body was 
found stuffed in a trash can in Griffith Park on Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Paul M. Walters said teams of police officers worked 43 hours 
straight after Nadia's abduction Monday and linked Gonzalez to the crime 
through a wealth of physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not release his photograph on advice of the district attorney's 
office, but authorities said Gonzalez matched the description that witnesses 
gave of Nadia's abductor: a Latino in his early to mid 30s with short, curly 
hair and a goatee. Gonzalez's car also matches the description of a small gray 
car with a black stripe on the sides, as reported by witnesses, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they watched Gonzalez leave his apartment at 11750 Euclid St. this 
morning, get into his car and begin to drive away. They then stopped and 
arrested him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez lives about four miles from where Nadia was abducted, near Diamond 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Walters said Gonzalez posed as a schoolteacher when he stopped his car Monday 
afternoon and asked Nadia to help him. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he alleged that he was a schoolteacher and wanted the girl to 
carry some books" seems to suggest that Nadia did not know him, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a number of other people were in Gonzalez's apartment at the time 
of the arrest, but it was unclear whether they are linked to the case. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other suspects, but they are very few -- I'd say a handful," Walters 
said, adding that police feel "very, very confident that this is the person 
that perpetrated this crime."

</P>
<P>
Police are exploring whether Nadia's case is linked to the murder nearly two 
ago years of Patricia Lopez, who disappeared a little more than a half mile 
away from where Monday's abduction occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"There are similar situations surrounding the Patricia Lopez case and Nadia's 
case," said Capt. James L. Dittman. But, he said, there are also an equal 
number of dissimilarities. Both girls were Latinas and who were taken from 
similar locations by a male suspects who "lured them away from their normal 
paths." But there are dissimilarities in the murder methods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia was killed with blows to the head from a blunt object, while Nadia was 
strangled, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Puente family home, more than 30 family members gathered to comfort 
Nadia's parents on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nadia's parents do not have money for the burial, and the Bank of America has 
established a trust fund for contributions at its branch at 16192 Harbor Blvd., 
Santa Ana, Calif. 92704.

Britain ordered nine more Iranians to leave the country on security grounds 
today after the break in diplomatic relations between the two nations brought 
on by Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
The latest expulsions include two former staff members of the Iranian Embassy 
and Iranian students, a Home Office spokesman said. The announcement brought to 
18 the number of Iranians ordered to leave the country since Britain severed 
ties after Iranian death threats against the British author in response to his 
novel, which many Muslims consider blasphemous.

A Long Beach judge this morning dismissed a charge of resisting arrest against 
Don Jackson, the activist who was arrested by a Long Beach police officer while 
conducting a videotaped "sting" that he said exposed police racism and 
brutality. 
</P>

Municipal Judge Gary Hahn threw out the misdemeanor charge against Jackson, 30, 
at the request of Long Beach Deputy City Prosecutor John Fentis, who asked for 
dismissal "in the interests of justice." The case was dismissed just as it was 
about to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Officer Mark Dickey, who arrested Jackson on Jan. 1, admitted 
before a state Senate oversight committee earlier this month that there were 
errors in his written police report on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police 
Department, had called the case against him "a farce."

A man who was struck and killed by a train in Reseda was apparently playing 
chicken on the railroad tracks and waited too long to jump to safety, Los 
Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Anthony Brown, 22, of Reseda was fatally injured about 10 p.m. Tuesday on 
the Southern Pacific tracks north of Roscoe Boulevard near White Oak Avenue, 
police said. Police ruled the death accidental. Detective Sandra Palmer said 
Brown, who may have been intoxicated, was standing on the tracks and apparently 
tried to jump away from the tracks to safety as the train went by. He managed 
to jump clear of the tracks but was hit by a handrail on the side of the train 
and knocked into a ditch, where he was found dead.

A 16-year-old boy, claiming to be the movie character Rambo, went on a shooting 
rampage today and killed his parents and younger brother and seriously wounded 
his sister, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Britton faces second-degree murder charges in the deaths of his parents, 
Dennis, 44, and Marlene, 42, and his brother, Jason, 8. The shootings occurred 
about 6 a.m. at the family home. Britton's sister, Sherry, 17, was in critical 
condition at Vassar Brothers Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Poughkeepsie Police Chief Stanley Still said that the boy was wearing military 
fatigues at the time of his arrest and that investigators found pictures of 
Rambo displayed on his bedroom wall. He said the shooting apparently erupted 
over an argument about the boy's school attendance.

Mayor Edward I. Koch declared a drought emergency today and imposed tough 
conservation measures, including a ban on watering lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Also banned were ornamental uses of water, including fountains, waterfalls and 
reflecting pools, even if they recirculate water. 
</P>
<P>
"New York won't be as green as usual this year," Koch said. "Tough times 
require tough measures, and the drought emergency will be a very tough time." 
The reservoirs that supply New York City were 55% full today. Normally, they 
are at 91.4% this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Other restrictions, all of which go into effect immediately, include a 20% 
reduction in water use by all businesses and a ban on washing cars and filling 
swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
Fines ranging from $100 to $500 can be imposed for violations; repeat offenders 
can be hit for up to $1,000.

The men, accompanied by two lawyers, emerged from the embassy in Pretoria at

To the ringing applause of delegates, a conference of 117 nations unanimously 
adopted a United Nations-sponsored treaty today to check a growing trade in the 
disposal of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four nations immediately signed a global convention on waste disposal in 
less-developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
The entire conference adopted the U.N.-sponsored treaty by consensus, and U.N. 
Undersecretary General Mostafa Tolba said the countries thereby indicated their 
intention to sign in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Our agreement has not halted the commerce in poison," said Tolba, executive 
director of the U.N. Environment Program. "But it has signaled the 
international resolve to eliminate the menace hazardous wastes pose to the 
welfare of our shared environment and to the health of all people."

Los Angeles.

The four stations are WHJY-FM and WHJJ-AM of Providence, R.I., and WVEZ-AM and 
WVEZ-FM in Louisville, Ky. Michael Nigris Jr., president of The Griffin Group, 
said the stations were acquired for $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since The Griffin Group's focus is in larger markets, it has contracted 
immediately to resell the Louisville stations for $6.5 million, Nigris said. 
Nigris said the acquisition was another step in The Griffin Group's plans to

The chief of Japan's Defense Agency today said he hopes the United States will 
not alter an agreement the two countries have for the joint development of the 
FSX fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to proceed with a joint development by all means . . . to 
increase reliable relationships between Japan and the United States," Kichiro 
Tazawa told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks followed a statement Tuesday by President Bush that the United 
States has decided to go ahead with the proposed fighter jet project with 
Japan, "with certain clarifications" to safeguard U.S. technology. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bush Administration and congressional sources, Bush will propose 
revising the agreement negotiated last year by the Ronald Reagan Administration 
to better protect computer "source codes" for the software that helps fly and 
control the plane and other sensitive U.S. data.

Rolls-Royce said today that its pretax profits rose 8% to $289 million in 1988 
as booming orders for its aircraft engines offset other drains on earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The British aero-engine firm had pretax profits of $268 million in 1987. Last 
year's figures were at the higher range of analysts' expectations. 
Rolls-Royce's earnings increased last year as orders for civil aircraft engines 
rose to $3.8 billion from $2.6 billion in 1987, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The strong orders offset other problems such as a weak dollar, which pressured 
profit margins and took away some gains from greater efficiency and volume. 
Also, the company posted an "exceptional item" of $49 million due to severance 
payments after it cut 1,900 jobs.

 A New York mailman who for years dreamed of running the 1,168-mile 
Anchorage-to-Nome Iditarod Sled Dog Race woke up in Nome today, his dream a 
reality, but not one he wants to relive any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
A team of huskies delivered Bob Hoyte to Nome's Front Street late Tuesday, 
earning him the Red Lantern, the award given to the last musher to cross the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyte, 42, of Ithaca, N.Y., made the rigorous trek across the roadless Alaska 
wilderness in 17 days, 11 hours, 19 minutes and 19 seconds. He reached Nome at 
8:19 p.m. Tuesday, with a small crowd gathered at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Runyan, 40, of Nenana, Alaska, won the world's longest sled dog race last 
Wednesday, making the journey in 11 days, 5 hours, 24 minutes and 34 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyte may have been last, but he made it. Eleven of the 49 mushers, or sled dog 
drivers, who left Anchorage March 4 dropped out along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyte had his problems, especially at the end, but neither snow nor dark of 
night nor rough trails nor high winds stopped this mailman. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it," Hoyte sighed, summing up his long-sought accomplishment and at the 
same time saying he had done what he set out to do and there was no burning 
desire for more. 
</P>
<P>
Before the race started, Hoyte said, "When I first read about the Iditarod, a 
chill went up my spine and I knew that this was something I had to do. Now it 
has reached the level of an obsession. I must do this so I can get on with the 
rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Hoyte, who now plans to get on with the rest of his life, suffered a real chill 
in the final days of the Iditarod when strong winds began battering the final 
stretch of Bering Sea coast trail to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
Although most mushers, including seasoned veterans, had an incredible two weeks 
of perfect weather with no storms, the slower-moving Hoyte got hit by winds 
before he could reach Nome. That held him up, and he holed up for a day in a 
cabin for protection a mere 40 miles from the end of the 1,168-mile Iditarod 
Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyte finally left the refuge of the shelter cabin and mushed into Nome with 
the temperature at 14 and the winds relenting to a mere 16 m.p.h., half what 
they were, for a 13-below-zero wind chill. He reached Nome 38th, a full day 
after the penultimate musher.

A federal grand jury has indicted Bob Probert on a felony charge of drug 
importation nearly three weeks after the former Detroit Red Wings forward 
allegedly tried to smuggle cocaine through the Detroit-Windsor tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Probert, a Canadian citizen living in Detroit, could be banned 
from the nited States, according to Roman Rewald, a Detroit lawyer who 
specializes in immigration and international law. 
</P>
<P>
Probert, 23, also faces up to 20 years in prison and a $1-million fine, but 
under federal sentencing guidelines, he would serve less than two years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Customs agents said they found 14 grams of cocaine in Probert's underwear on 
March 2 as he tried to enter the United States from Canada. The Red Wings 
suspended Probert, but the National Hockey League expelled him two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Parker, head of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office, said 
Tuesday he decided to charge Probert with a felony, because a "misdemeanor did 
not adequately represent the nature of his conduct."
