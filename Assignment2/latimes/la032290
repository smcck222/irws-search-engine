HOMELESS PROVE ELUSIVE TO S.D. CENSUS TAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was just after dawn, and Benjamin Leff, census taker for a day, trudged 
through a narrow, swampy path in search of subjects for the nation's population 
count. 
</P>
<P>
Latino day laborers en route to prospective jobs in Northern San Diego County 
periodically passed on his left and right, behind him and in front of him, but 
few were close enough to allow the counter to veer from his soggy route and ask 
his array of questions. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to have an army of 100,000 people out here to count 'em all," a 
frustrated Leff said as he came to a dead-end, his progress blocked by a boggy 
channel leading from the Agua Hedionda Lagoon. "Anyway, it's an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Leff's difficulties were emblematic of those faced by about 250 census takers 
-- "enumerators" -- assigned to count residents of the migrant camps of San 
Diego County, one of the nation's most singular outposts of homelessness. 
Later, officials acknowledged that a recount of the migrants might be necessary 
because of the North County's "unique set of characteristics" and the inherent 
difficulty of counting such a population, said Michael J. Weiler, assistant 
regional census manager. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the migrant count, officials said that counting the homeless 
proceeded smoothly throughout the San Diego area. Advocates for the homeless 
have long argued that official methodology would probably result in an 
undercount, and Weiler conceded that "the results may be on the conservative 
side." 
</P>
<P>
Detailed data will not be available until at least April, 1991. The homeless 
counts on Tuesday and Wednesday kicked off the tally for the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
The census, a massive undertaking, is a critical funding tool; allotments of 
government monies to areas are often based on population. For every resident 
not counted, it is estimated that about $200 is lost -- $150 in federal funds 
and $50 in state money. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego and Imperial counties, officials positioned about 650 census 
takers, including 314 in downtown San Diego and 250 in North County. More than 
700 locations were predesignated as homeless sites, although homeless advocates 
said that many spots were probably missed, including many isolated migrant 
camps in Northern San Diego County and some canyon residences in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau "just doesn't know where these folks are," said the Rev. 
Rafael V. Martinez, a Presbyterian minister who works with migrant workers and 
has been critical of official plans to count the day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the enumerators on duty was Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who praised the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
As in other cities, some San Diego shelters provided incentives such as free 
meals, movies and soft drinks to attract homeless people and make it easier for 
visiting census officials to count them. At the St. Vincent de Paul/Joan Kroc 
Center downtown, the city's largest shelter, a "slumber party" drew 800 guests 
Tuesday evening, double the shelter's normal capacity. Cots were placed in the 
dining hall and chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult homeless people to count in San Diego are the 
thousands of migrant laborers, mostly men from Mexico, who are often in the 
shadow of suburban homes valued at $250,000 or more. They reside in a variety 
of crude squatters' dwellings ranging from shacks fashioned from scrap wood and 
plastic to bunker-like caves excavated from the dirt -- "spider holes," as they 
are known. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number of such homeless migrants, many of them undocumented, 
range from 5,000 to 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Census authorities in San Diego had pledged to do their utmost to count the 
migrant population -- whether they are legal U.S. residents or not. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll go wherever these migrants live," vowed Maureen R. Wanzie, the Census 
Bureau's district office manager in Carlsbad, on the eve of the count. "We're 
talking about canyons. We're talking about spider holes. We're talking about 
temporary housing that may consist of just a blanket or a piece of cardboard." 
</P>
<P>
But counting the migrants proved a daunting task. Finding them was a big part 
of the problem, and many census takers did not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"Sign language," one census taker explained when asked how he expected to 
accomplish his goal without speaking Spanish. Census counters acknowledged that 
they largely dispensed with in-depth questioning and relied on head counts and 
brief conversations. 
</P>
<P>
By dawn at 6 a.m. in a lifting fog, two elderly census counters who spoke 
little Spanish wandered alone through a field along El Camino Real, the main 
curbside hiring venue for migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
"You seen anyone yet?" asked Robert Nelson, winded after a mile walk, as he 
climbed over a barbed-wire fence, narrowly avoiding snagging his white, 
government-issue vest identifying him as a census taker. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen a thing," said Nelson, who clutched his census clipboard and 
forms. "Not even a jack rabbit out there." 
</P>
<P>
Ahead were two small migrant camps. "Census? I haven't seen anyone from the 
census," said Juan Prado, a 22-year-old undocumented Mexican who was just 
waking inside his wood-and-plastic lean-to wedged into a hillside dotted with 
migrant outposts. "Maybe the census people will come by the packing house 
later," Prado said, speaking of the flower-packing facility where he 
occasionally finds work. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road, hopeful day laborers were starting to gather at the Country 
Store in Carlsbad, one of the favorite migrant waiting spots for roadside 
labor. Also present early Wednesday were a number of census counters, one of 
whom dutifully took information from a number of men standing in front of the 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," another census taker said, interrupting her busy colleague, "all of 
these guys have already been counted." 
</P>
<P>
Most migrants appeared willing to chat with the census takers, despite their 
fear of authorities. "I'll do whatever I can for the government of the United 
States," offered Francisco Carvajal, a 42-year-old Mexican man who had just 
been interviewed by census officials in a nearby shopping center. "They need to 
know that we're here." 
</P>
<P>
Down the road, four census takers began walking through a swampy path they 
hoped would lead to a camp. The route quickly led into a thickly vegetated 
quagmire, and no further progress could be made without risk of becoming 
covered in the inky goo. 
</P>
<P>
"The best you can do is count 'em as they come out," said a woman census taker 
proceeding gingerly along the sodden trail. 
</P>
<P>
"One problem," said Leff, who was following along the trail, " . . . is that no 
one seems to know where these people are for sure. There's nothing you can look 
at and say, 'It's here.' Right now, there doesn't seem to be anybody here."

LORD VICTOR ROTHSCHILD, 79; ONCE LINKED TO SPY SCANDAL

<P>
Lord Victor Rothschild, millionaire banker and a former British intelligence 
agent who was once briefly linked to one of Britain's most controversial spy 
scandals, has died, his wife said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lady Rothschild said in a statement that her husband died Tuesday at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
She did not disclose the cause of death or other details. 
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel Mayer Victor Rothschild was born into the 200-year-old family 
descended from German coin collectors who founded a banking dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
He was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College in Cambridge as a 
biophysicist. 
</P>
<P>
He succeeded his uncle as the fourth Baron Rothschild in 1937 and took his seat 
in the House of Lords as a member of the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
At Cambridge in the 1930s he had joined an exclusive debating society known as 
the Apostles, which included Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby and 
Anthony Blunt, who were later exposed as agents for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 some parliamentarians called for investigations into whether Rothschild 
had also been a Soviet spy. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dismissed the 
speculation, and Rothschild strongly denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of World War II, Rothschild joined British military intelligence. 
In 1944 he was awarded the George Medal after defusing German explosives hidden 
in a case of onions in a ship's hold. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish even while endangered, he carried out the operation with a set of 
jeweler's screwdrivers given to him by Cartier. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild had spent 20 years as an executive with Shell Oil Co. He took that 
job after just two months working in the family bank, a job he said he found 
dull. But he remained a director of Rothschild and Sons and was chairman from 
1975-76.

Nearly one-fourth of all California communities are building no housing for the 
poor, despite state-mandated plans that require each community to construct its 
share of low-income housing, according to a survey by the California Coalition 
for Rural Housing. The study found that plenty of homes are being built for the 
wealthy, but only 16% of the housing needed for low-income people is being 
constructed. The study found that only 97,424 low-income housing units were 
built statewide through the end of 1989 -- at least 500,000 housing units less 
than required under current plans.

State labor and safety officials raided more than 70 sewing shops and issued 
more than $63,000 in fines this week in one of the largest raids on suspected 
sweatshops in Orange County. The sweep was aimed at cracking down on repeat 
offenders by making surprise inspections of garment factories that have been 
cited before for wage, hour, child-labor or record-keeping violations. "We want 
to make sure they know we're serious, and not just think that we issue a 
citation, they pay, and we forget the whole thing," said Senior Labor Deputy 
Phil Galvez. Tuesday's inspections centered on Garden Grove, Westminster, Santa 
Ana and Huntington Beach.

DEATH PENALTY: MOTHER TERESA PLANS TO CALL GOV. DEUKMEJIAN FROM INDIA TO ASK 
THAT CONDEMNED KILLER ROBERT HARRIS NOT BE EXECUTED. 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian announced Wednesday that he has canceled next week's 
clemency hearing for condemned killer Robert Alton Harris, saying he was merely 
carrying out the convicted murderer's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the celebrated champion of the poor and dying, Mother Teresa, jumped 
into the fight to save Harris' life. Working through a Jesuit seminarian from 
Berkeley, the Nobel laureate, who is based in India, got Deukmejian to agree to 
talk to her by telephone early next week, possibly Monday, so she can 
personally plead for Harris' life. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, the father of one of the two teen-age boys Harris killed in 1978 
said that if Harris really has sent the victims' families a message in recent 
weeks, he has not received it. "I haven't got diddly-squat," said Steve Baker, 
a San Diego police detective. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, convicted of the murders of Baker's son, Michael, and Michael's 
friend, John Mayeski, is in line to be the first person executed in California 
in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, Deukmejian noted that he had received a letter from 
Harris Tuesday in which the murderer, who is scheduled to be executed April 3, 
withdrew his request for executive clemency. 
</P>
<P>
"Since there is now no request for clemency before me, the hearing which was 
scheduled for March 27 is hereby canceled," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gore, Deukmejian's press secretary, noted that Harris' avenues for a 
reprieve from the death penalty now lie entirely with the courts. "The governor 
has the authority to grant a temporary reprieve, but right now there is no 
reason to do so because there are still judicial proceedings pending, and one 
has not been requested," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, in his letter to the governor, said he was withdrawing his request for 
clemency because he did not believe he would get a fair hearing from 
Deukmejian, a leading advocate of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Charles M. Sevilla, one of Harris' San Diego attorneys, declined Wednesday to 
comment on Deukmejian's action. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Deukmejian, Harris also mentioned that while he had "nothing" 
to say to the governor or the press, he did have "something to say" to the 
Baker and Mayeski families but had "already done that privately." 
</P>
<P>
After Harris' letter to the governor, dated Monday, was released Tuesday 
afternoon, Sevilla said that "a couple weeks ago" Harris sent a "private 
communication to the Baker family." 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla has declined to release details of the "communication," saying that 
what Harris said was between him and the families. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Baker said Wednesday that he knew nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if he did (send it), I didn't get it," Baker said Wednesday. "I don't 
know what he's talking about." 
</P>
<P>
John Mayeski's mother, Kathryn Mayeski Sanders, 68, a retired civilian 
electronics technician with the Navy, said Tuesday that Harris has had "no 
contact with us at all." 
</P>
<P>
Harris was arrested July 5, 1978, by Steve Baker, who did not know at the time 
that Harris' victims included his son. Harris killed both 16-year-old boys 
after stealing their car for use in a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Gore, the governor's press secretary, confirmed that Deukmejian has agreed to 
speak with Mother Teresa early next week, but he said the exact day had not 
been set. The Roman Catholic nun would speak to the governor from Calcutta, 
where she works among the poor and those who are near death. "We are working 
with her representatives. It is just a matter of coordinating their two 
schedules," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
The press secretary said Deukmejian is not worried about being put on the spot 
by the woman who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and is considered a living 
saint by her followers because of her work among the people she calls "the 
poorest of the poor." 
</P>
<P>
"He is a public figure, and he is prepared to talk about his views," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, pleas for mercy on behalf of convicted murders by leaders of the 
Roman Catholic Church have gone unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa, along with Jimmy Carter and other international figures, in 1986 
appealed unsuccessfully for clemency in the case of James Terry Roach, a South 
Carolina man who was put to death for the murder of two teen-agers. Pope John 
Paul II was turned down by two different Florida governors when he pleaded for 
the lives of murderers who were put to death in 1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In the Harris case, the intermediary for Mother Teresa is John Dear, a 
seminarian at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley.

DESPONDENT MOTHER KILLS HER 3 CHILDREN AND HERSELF; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: NEIGHBORS SAY THE WOMAN HAD SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND AND WAS FACING 
FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY.

A single mother, apparently despondent over the breakup of her marriage and her 
struggle to provide for her three children, shot them as they slept in the 
family's Reseda home, and then killed herself, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the woman and her children, along with the slain family dog, were 
found Wednesday afternoon by friends of the eldest daughter who broke into the 
house because they had not heard from the girl and feared something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Brandy Fernandez, 16, and Leticia Fernandez, 13, were found shot to death in 
their bedrooms. The body of Roxanne Jones, 32, was discovered lying near that 
of her youngest child, Jeremiah Jones, 7, in the master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
A small-caliber rifle was found in the master bedroom, detectives said, along 
with a lengthy suicide note written by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"She wrote a several-page suicide note asking for her loved ones to forgive 
her," Los Angeles Police Lt. William Gaida said. "The note basically had stuff 
like 'God forgive me' and things of that nature." 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to elaborate on the contents of the handwritten note, but 
neighbors said Jones had separated from her husband four months ago and was 
facing financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"They were having a lot of problems," Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently unable to find steady work, Jones had been baby-sitting and picking 
up odd jobs for extra money. One such job was distributing advertising flyers 
for a pizzeria where her daughter Brandy had worked until recently, friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandy contributed her pay from the Two for One Pizza Co. to the household 
kitty, said her boyfriend, Derek Shelton, 18. She was laid off last week 
because "business was a little slow," said store manager Darren Amerson. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the four bodies in the modest house on Tampa Avenue touched 
off scenes of grief in the working-class neighborhood, where crowds thronged 
the sidewalk and gawking drivers caused a rush-hour traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
The fathers of the children arrived and were escorted away by police. 
Distraught relatives, friends and neighbors wept openly and called out the bad 
news to others as they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"My nieces are in there!" yelled Stella Chavez, sister of the dead woman's 
first husband, jumping a yellow police barrier and running toward the house. 
She was gently restrained by police officers and taken back to her car. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that little boy is all right. I just love that little boy," said an 
elderly neighbor, holding her hands to her face. 
</P>
<P>
The family was described by friends as close and happy until four months ago 
when Jones -- described by some friends as deeply religious -- separated from 
her husband and the father of her son, Jeff Jones, a house painter who moved to 
Canoga Park. They had moved into the rented house at the corner of Tampa and 
Arminta avenues after arriving from Oregon about four years ago, neighbors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' first husband was Joaquin Fernandez of San Fernando, father of Leticia 
and Brandy, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the recent separation, the mother had faced a financial hardship in 
caring for the children, neighbors said. She had previously worked as a 
bookkeeper for her husband, but recently had asked neighbors for small amounts 
of money. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything just wasn't going well for her," said Lance Johnson, a neighbor and 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
Madeleine Bellomo, Jeremiah's first-grade teacher at Blythe Street Elementary 
School in Reseda, said that two weeks ago the boy told her that his family was 
going to "the House of David," a religious retreat which he described as a 
"good place where God is and there are no worries and everything would be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said religious sayings had been written in black ink on walls 
throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor said Jeremiah would roam the neighborhood, taking broken and 
discarded toys home to try to repair and use himself. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the family's financial problems, Shelton said, "everything seemed OK. 
They would have arguments, but it would never go beyond the verbal level." 
</P>
<P>
Shelton said he and Brandy went bowling with friends Monday night, returning at 
3 a.m. Tuesday. When he tried to call her later that day and Wednesday, there 
was no answer. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they could not estimate when the killings took place, but no one in 
the family was seen after Brandy's return. Sid Slackman, a neighbor two doors 
away on Tampa, said he heard what he thought were four or five gunshots about 1 
a.m. Wednesday. "Then silence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the small rented house was kept tidy by Jones and that 
photographs of the children hung on walls in every room of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was seen a week ago clearing tall weeds in her back yard. Don Simpson, a 
city employee who was trimming trees on Arminta Avenue, had helped her. "She 
was an easy, free-going person," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lonny Gordon, a family friend, was stunned. "They were a happy family," he 
said. "I used to come by here to visit because there was happiness there."

GLITCHES SLOW CENSUS TAKERS SEARCHING FOR THE HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
POVERTY: A LACK OF TRANSLATORS AND SPANISH-LANGUAGE FORMS HURTS THEIR EFFORTS. 
AN ANGRY COUNTY SUPERVISOR HELPS THEM COUNT HEADS.

<TEXT>
<P>
At Wednesday's first light, weary teams of census takers plunged into the 
thicket of Ventura's Hobo Jungle, searching for the hard-core homeless who live 
in makeshift quarters along the dry bed of the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
It was the final step in a balky and often awkward effort to tally the county's 
homeless as part of the 1990 U.S. Census. The sweep had begun nearly 12 hours 
earlier when census takers descended on the county's homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
More than once, census workers showed up without badly needed bilingual 
translators and Spanish-language census forms to count homeless Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
On two occasions, the census effort struck county Supervisor Madge Schaefer as 
so badly organized that she helped count people at homeless shelters in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the widely publicized project was over, some of the county's 
homeless remained uncounted. But the census teams had managed to count others, 
and the long night of interviewing had touched some of the census workers 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are really just like us," said John Pence, after interviewing a 
painfully shy 60-year-old man who had built his home out of wooden pallets 
wedged underneath the Main Street Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us live in houses; others end up in a shack in the river bottom," said 
Pence, 68, a retiree who decided to help with the homeless count. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dusk-to-dawn sweep rarely went smoothly, it came off without a 
single violent incident, said Geary-Ellen Williams, manager of the local census 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeless advocates had worried that a pre-dawn arrival of census takers 
might anger some of the more antisocial people who live in the stretch of 
Ventura River bottom known as Hobo Jungle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of freaky to see all these strangers," said John White, 42, who has 
lived in the river bottom for six months. "What's next, the SWAT team?" 
</P>
<P>
At another encampment, Michael Baird, a census taker, asked two homeless men 
about another man who was sleeping in a nearby tent. "Can I wake him up?" Baird 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't do that," one of the men responded. "He's the unsociable kind." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many shanties and makeshift tents went unexplored. And while 
census takers were tromping through the homeless camp, a number of homeless 
people scampered up the river's levee and into town. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way they could find them all," said Patrick Driskell, executive 
director of Project Understanding, a nonprofit group that provides food, 
clothing and a variety of services to the homeless in Ventura. "Some just won't 
want to be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Census takers met virtually no resistance from the homeless they had met 
earlier at the county's shelters. A census team was warmly greeted by many who 
had congregated inside the Ventura County Rescue Mission, a 50-bed home for 
single homeless men in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people may be a little distrustful of the government, but I don't think 
there should be any objections," said Michael Blodgett, 40, who added that he 
has been homeless for five years. He suggested that the census could bring the 
homeless and other needy people a bigger share of federal money, especially 
after expected reductions in the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they are American citizens, they should stand up and be counted," 
Blodgett said. 
</P>
<P>
Two dozen Latinos, huddled outside the mission, voiced no fears about 
cooperating with U.S. authorities. Filomone Basquez, who has been in the United 
States for two months, said he was not worried that the Census Bureau would 
breach its promise of confidentiality to turn over information to immigration 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when the team of census workers arrived at the mission, all but a few of 
those congregated outside slipped into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The most embarrassing problems came inside the Ventura County Mission. Latino 
men comprised the vast majority of those waiting for a hot meal and a bed. Few 
spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
Not one of the census team's three members could speak Spanish. The two elderly 
white men and one elderly white woman arrived without an interpreter and short 
of Spanish-language census forms. 
</P>
<P>
As the mission's pastor led the congregation in hymns, census workers threaded 
through the pews, asking if anyone spoke English. Time after time, they were 
waved away by a wagging finger. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen," said Schaefer, who had donned a 
white Census Bureau smock to supervise the count. "They were supposed to call 
for a translator." 
</P>
<P>
It was too much for Schaefer. For months, she has promoted a full census count 
as crucial for the county to receive its fair share of federal dollars, which 
are distributed by population. 
</P>
<P>
Between hymns, she nudged a bilingual mission employee to make an announcement 
in Spanish about the census. Then she scolded a Census Bureau supervisor, who 
was accompanying her, until he agreed to telephone for more Spanish-language 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
At the county's Armory in Oxnard, another census team arrived without 
Spanish-speaking or bilingual workers. The Armory was reopened Tuesday night by 
a special order of the governor in an effort to attract homeless people to a 
central location for easy counting. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-eight homeless people showed up for a free chili dinner and a canvas 
cot; however, census workers had collected only 28 of the 78 listed on the 
shelter's roster as many began to settle into bed. 
</P>
<P>
Worried that they might not be counted, Schaefer demanded that bureau officials 
call in a translator. Within a few minutes, two bilingual census employees 
appeared, making announcements and passing out Spanish-language forms. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer picked up some forms and began to assist Latino men in filling them 
out. "I filled out seven forms in five minutes," she said. "And they didn't 
speak any English and I don't speak any Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said she was told that if any homeless people in the shelters were not 
counted by midnight, they would not be counted at all. 
</P>
<P>
But Randy Metcalf, a regional census supervisor accompanying Schaefer, later 
said she was misinformed. He said that if any of the homeless in the shelter 
were not interviewed, their numbers would be picked up from the shelter's 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going very smoothly," Metcalf assured reporters during the 
all-night sweep. "We've had no problems." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Alnwick, a Los Angeles-based Census Bureau researcher who wanted to 
unofficially witness the homeless count firsthand, appeared exasperated at the 
never-ending glitches. 
</P>
<P>
"This is controlled chaos," he said, rolling his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, with the long night's work behind them, census 
officials conceded that there had been some problems in finding Spanish 
translators for the head count but proclaimed that the project had been 
successful overall. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, the manager for the Ventura County district office of the Census 
Bureau, said that only seven of the 59 census takers who showed up to count the 
homeless spoke Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
She said the district office and the city of Oxnard had sponsored Spanish 
language ads on local radio and television stations, but failed to attract 
enough Spanish speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we'd have enough people who spoke Spanish, but we didn't realize 
there were that many homeless people who don't speak English," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she sent out four translators when Schaefer called during the 
count Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning. One was a receptionist and the 
others were managers and supervisors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams denied that the lack of Spanish speakers affected the accuracy of 
the count. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it went really well," she said.

SEA LIONS: IN SEATTLE, THEY HAVE DEVOURED PRECIOUS STEELHEAD TROUT. A FEDERAL 
PROJECT RETURNS SIX OF THE MARINE MAMMALS TO THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. WILL THEY 
STAY?

<P>
The state of Washington, where residents have bumper stickers complaining about 
greedy Californians, went to extraordinary lengths Wednesday to get rid of a 
few. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the federal government, the state stuffed six California 
natives into a horse trailer, drove them nonstop to Santa Barbara and shipped 
them 48 miles out to sea to one of the Channel Islands off the Ventura County 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
But the six would-be emigres -- all California sea lions with an insatiable 
craving for Washington's steelhead trout -- may prove as difficult to get rid 
of as the hordes of smog-weary Californians who have migrated north. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are afraid the sea lions will swim from their birthplace in the 
Channel Islands back to the Seattle area, where they've destroyed a large part 
of a run of steelhead trout during their last five winter migrations. 
</P>
<P>
"The sea lions were born in California and raised in California, but, 
unfortunately for us, they decided to take a winter vacation in the Northwest," 
said Joe Scordino, a deputy chief with the National Marine Fishery Service in 
Seattle. "We're just cutting their tourism a bit short." 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast population of the sea lions, who once were hunted nearly to 
extinction for their pelts, has virtually exploded since they became a 
protected species in 1972, biologists said. These days, the creatures are 
causing problems from Seattle to San Francisco, where they have damaged part of 
a $2-million pier at Fisherman's Wharf, but are not threatening any fish. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, the beasts have eaten so many steelhead trout on their way to spawn 
in tributaries of Lake Washington that the run at the Ballard Locks canal has 
shrunk from about 4,000 fish annually to only 2,000, Scordino said. Two Indian 
tribes in Seattle, the Muckleshoot and the Suquamish, have federal treaty 
rights to fish for the trout and have pressured the state and federal 
government to do something about the massacre, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pitting environmentalists against animal activists against commercial 
fishermen," said Susan Ewing, a spokeswoman for the Washington Department of 
Wildlife. "And everybody has conflicting opinions about what should be done." 
</P>
<P>
Working together for the past five years, state and federal officials have 
tried detonating firecrackers underwater to scare the sea lions away. It worked 
for a couple of years, but the animals grew accustomed to the loud noise, said 
Gene Kruse, deputy regional director for the National Marine Fishery Service in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
So, the officials turned to feeding the sea lions dead fish laced with a 
non-lethal substance that makes them vomit, Kruse said. The wily marine mammals 
simply stopped eating the chemical fare after a while, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting the beasts with rubber bullets has had some effect, Kruse said, but a 
program that involved shipping them 200 miles south failed. About 29 of the 37 
sea lions trucked south just swam back to their prime feeding ground in 
Seattle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just too smart for us," Kruse said. 
</P>
<P>
So, as a last resort, about $15,000 in federal funds was budgeted to cart the 
marine mammals farther south to their home ground in the Channel Islands. The 
sea lions' annual mating season begins there in May, and officials are hoping 
the animals will stick around to get an early start, rather than heading 1,000 
miles north to Washington for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
If the six creatures stay put, government officials said they will consider 
trucking south the 30 or so remaining in Seattle as well. But the cost of 
hauling the 400- to 700-pound beasts may be prohibitive, Scordino said. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Washington is also exploring whether it has a legal right under 
federal laws to kill the beasts based on the theory that they are hurting the 
public welfare by destroying the fish run, Scordino said. 
</P>
<P>
But Scordino said he would much prefer it if the sea lions would simply go 
away. And he made this concession: "Californians are welcome in Washington -- 
as long as they are not sea lions."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEY IN JAIL 'POT' CASE WON'T FACE 
TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A defense attorney who allegedly handed a client cigarettes stuffed with 
marijuana during a visit to a Los Angeles County Jail will not face criminal 
charges because of a lack of evidence, county prosecutors said this week. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Paul Potter was arrested and booked for felony smuggling of 
narcotics into a jail and possession of a drug in jail after he allegedly 
handed a package of cigarettes to an inmate in the attorney's room of the Men's 
Central Jail. 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent search of the inmate, Steven Young, revealed that the seal was 
broken on the package of cigarettes, and that they were stuffed with marijuana 
with tobacco plugged at each end, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some evidence that perhaps he should have known better, but basically 
there is not enough evidence to take it to a jury," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Michael Knight.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LIBERACE'S LOVER TESTIFIES IN QUADRUPLE 
MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former lover of the late entertainer Liberace Wednesday linked both 
defendants in the Laurel Canyon murder trial to the house where four people 
were bludgeoned to death in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Thorson, 31, who said he received a settlement of $95,000 after he filed 
a palimony suit against Liberace, testified that he was staying at the Studio 
City home of defendant Adel (Eddie Nash) Nasrallah in 1981 when he overheard a 
violent argument between Nash and porno movie star John Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
Nash and co-defendant Gregory Diles, Nash's bodyguard, were "beating Mr. Holmes 
up," Thorson said under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Dale Davidson. "I 
heard Mr. Nash . . . telling Mr. Holmes that if he didn't take him to where 
those people were who robbed him, he would have every member of his family 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the murders were in retaliation for a robbery two days 
earlier by three occupants of the house, with Holmes' aid.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN FOUND FATALLY STABBED IN HER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies are investigating the stabbing death of a 50-year-old woman 
whose body was discovered Tuesday afternoon in her home in an unincorporated 
area south of Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Pedroni, an assistant supervisor at a Glendale Galleria fast-food 
restaurant, was found by her two sons shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
She had stab wounds in the upper body, Sgt. Terry Judge said. No weapon has 
been recovered. Homicide Detective Sgt. David Krishna said he has suspects but 
would not elaborate. He would not discuss motives or say if anything was taken 
from the home in the 5300 block of Huddart Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Garcia, a co-worker who knew Pedroni, said Pedroni had worked at the 
Galleria for five years and was called "Grandma" by the mostly younger workers. 
"She was really a fun lady to work with," said Garcia, adding that everyone 
cried, "even the guys," when they heard about her death.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is not a subtle town. Its people drink Corona beer from the bottle and eat 
chili dogs. They celebrate important events by dining at Chinese restaurants in 
which food is ordered by the number. Sometimes they order No. 4 with the 
chicken chow mein, sometimes No. 11 with egg foo young. But they never order 
bird's nest soup and they never use chopsticks. 
</P>
<P>
I mention that by way of explaining the current bewilderment at the turn of 
events that may bring the Raiders back to Oakland. The people love the Raiders. 
That is, they loved the Raiders. Past tense. They want the Raiders back. That 
is, they want the Raiders back but they do not want to buy them back for $660 
million, which is what the city leaders are willing to spend. 
</P>
<P>
And they do not want Al Davis back, no matter what. If there were a way they 
could get the Raiders without Davis and without having to mortgage their souls, 
they'd think about it. Carefully. 
</P>
<P>
I am an Oakland boy, born and raised here. I flew up the other day to ask how 
the people felt about the team returning to the town it left in tears eight 
years ago to come to Glitz City. One of them replied by asking, "Who wants a 
second visit from a rapist?" 
</P>
<P>
Another held up a drawing by Lou Grant, a former editorial cartoonist for the 
Oakland Tribune. It shows a monster emerging from the slime and muck of the 
bay, heading toward Oakland. The caption says, "Creature from the silver and 
black lagoon." The monster is Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Guys like the Electric Shoeshine Man feel betrayed. When the Raiders left in 
1982, he said Oakland would cease to exist. He meant it. "Adios, Oakland," was 
the way he put it. He would have given his manhood to keep them. But now? 
</P>
<P>
"How can we spend that kind of money for a football team when we can't even 
feed the people?" he said, putting a gloss on a pair of brown loafers in his 
shop on Webster Street. His real name is Clarence Blair. They call him the 
Electric Shoeshine Man because he sometimes uses a plug-in buffer. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanna charge $30 a ticket for the worst seats in the house so they can 
pay Davis all that money. Who can afford that? Hardly anybody. This is a poor 
town. The stadium's gonna be empty, and that's a sad thing." 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, in a saloon called Mr. B's, Don Bankston, the Mr. B in the name, 
was skeptical.

<P>
"They left us once," he was saying, "and they could leave us again. How can you 
trust Al Davis?" 
</P>
<P>
He was seated under strings of blinking red and green lights that trailed 
across the ceiling. On the wall behind the bar was a T-shirt you could buy for 
$12. It said, "The Silver and Black are Back." 
</P>
<P>
This used to be the Cactus Room. It was Oakland's No. 1 Raiders bar, decorated 
with team memorabilia. The players themselves drank here in the old days. When 
they left for L.A., owner Al Puncsak almost cried. "They're taking our 
children," he said. Two years later, he sold the bar. No one knows where he is. 
</P>
<P>
"Al Davis may be one hell of a businessman," Mr. B said under the blinking 
lights, "but he's got a lesson coming. You can't buy loyalty." He shrugged. "It 
was a love affair and now it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Ex-wrestler Sammy Stein was chairman of the Moose Club committee that welcomed 
the Raiders into existence in 1960. He was a Raiders fan san pareil. He loved 
Big Ben Davidson like a son. Kenny Stabler too and the old man, George Blanda. 
</P>
<P>
Now he feels that pouring out taxpayer's money to bring the Raiders back is 
like trying to raise the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't even the same team," he said, looking out a window of his home in the 
Dimond District. "Only the guys who smoke dollar cigars want them back. I won't 
go see them anymore. You can't fool the sports fans of Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
I heard it downtown and I heard it in the neighborhoods. I heard it at a sports 
bar called the King's X and I heard it at the airport. The Raiders aren't worth 
$660 million. Not these Raiders. The people will get stuck with the bill. The 
people ought to be able to vote on it. The people are getting screwed. 
</P>
<P>
Even my sister Emily is p.o.'d. She is a calm and gentle woman, almost serene. 
She doesn't curse, drink gin or smoke cigars. There's one in every family. 
</P>
<P>
The only time I ever heard her swear was when Lamonica hit Biletnikoff with a 
40-yard touchdown pass in the last six seconds of a game. Later, she said her 
rosary beads and asked forgiveness for the unseemly display. 
</P>
<P>
But now she's saying, "To hell with the Raiders. The schools need the money. 
Oakland kids are growing up stupid. Last year we got stuck with a $90 city tax. 
What will it be to pay for a damned football team?" 
</P>
<P>
Sister Emily sure has changed.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY COUNCIL WANTS VALLEY TO GET NEXT RAIL 
LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to request that the 
San Fernando Valley get priority over two competing areas -- in Pasadena and 
the Los Angeles International Airport vicinity -- for construction of the next 
mass transit rail line. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 12-3 vote may have little impact because the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission appears bent on approving a plan by its staff under 
which the Valley line -- an extension to Van Nuys of the downtown-to-North 
Hollywood Metro Rail subway -- would be built after the other two. 
</P>
<P>
The first to be constructed under the staff's plan would be a 2.5-mile spur 
from the western terminus of the Century Freeway light-rail line to LAX, and 
the second would be a 13.5-mile light-rail line from downtown to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes that California voters on June 5 will approve ballot 
propositions to pay for mass transit.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT IN 20 BANK ROBBERIES CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old man believed to be the so-called Mid-Wilshire bandit was captured 
Wednesday afternoon by Beverly Hills police, who began pursuing him immediately 
after he allegedly held up a Wilshire Boulevard bank. 
</P>
<P>
When officers arrested Devere A. Jones about two miles from a Bank of America 
branch in the 8300 block of Wilshire, they found $1,200 stuffed in his socks 
and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Sammy Lee was writing a traffic ticket only a block from the bank when 
he heard the crime broadcast and spotted Jones' car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Police Lt. David Griffey said Jones, of Los Angeles, is suspected 
of robbing seven banks in Beverly Hills and 13 others nearby. Jones did not use 
a gun in the Wednesday robbery, police said, adding that he announced a holdup 
and asked for the "big bills." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was booked on suspicion of robbery and held in lieu of $50,000 bail.

<P>
City officials have unanimously approved construction of a two-building, 
multi-tenant industrial project at Pleasant Valley Road and Constitution Avenue 
in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The permit was sought by Conejo Valley Pramins of Camarillo, which said the 
26,525-square-foot condominium's 15 units would probably be sold to small 
businesses including light manufacturing firms or auto detailing shops. 
</P>
<P>
Before any further action on the development takes place, Camarillo Planning 
Commission officials said the City Council must approve the subdivision of the 
eight-acre property. The council meets March 28. 
</P>
<P>
In other matters, the Planning Commission Tuesday approved a request to expand 
the administrative offices and maintenance yard of Leisure Village Assn., which 
manages about 2,100 residential units in eastern Camarillo. JEFF SCHNAUFER

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are hunting two men who took more than $3,000 in unrelated bank 
robberies Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
About 10:30 a.m., a man in a blue suit and white shirt entered the Home Federal 
Savings branch in the 3900 block of 30th Street and gave a teller a note 
stating, "You are being robbed, give me your $20s, $50s and $100s." 
</P>
<P>
He then told the teller that he was serious, said Bill Robinson, a spokesman 
for the San Diego Police Department. The man netted $2,910. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was described as black, about 25 years old, 5-foot-10 and 180 
pounds, with a medium build, Robinson said. He also has a mustache, a receding 
hairline and black, collar-length hair. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the robber fits the description of a man who robbed two banks in 
February. On Feb. 8, Grossmont Bank, in the 3700 block of 5th Avenue, was 
robbed of $700. On Feb. 23, Great Western Bank, in the 3000 block of El Cajon 
Boulevard, was robbed of $980. 
</P>
<P>
Also about noon Tuesday, a man entered the back door of Great American Bank, in 
the 9900 block of Scripps Ranch Boulevard, told a teller that he had a gun and 
demanded money, Robinson said. The man escaped with $1,612. 
</P>
<P>
The robber is described as white, in his 20s, with brown collar-length hair. He 
was wearing a blue baseball cap, jeans and mirrored sunglasses, Robinson said.

COUNCIL ASKS THAT VALLEY RAIL LINE BE TOP PRIORITY; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: BUT THE ACTION MAY BE AN EMPTY SYMBOL BECAUSE THE COMMISSION 
FAVORS BUILDING LAX AND PASADENA ROUTES FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to request that the 
San Fernando Valley get priority over two competing areas for construction of 
the next mass transit rail line, but the vote may have been an empty symbol. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-3 vote may have little effect because the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission appears bent on approving a plan by its staff under 
which the Valley line -- an extension to Van Nuys of the downtown-to-North 
Hollywood Metro Rail subway -- would be built after the other two lines. 
</P>
<P>
The first to be constructed under the county commission's plan would be a 
2.5-mile spur from the western terminus of the Century Freeway light-rail line 
to Los Angeles International Airport, and second would be a 13.5-mile 
light-rail line from downtown to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes that California voters on June 5 will approve ballot 
propositions raising the gasoline tax by 9 cents per gallon and allowing the 
sale of billions of dollars in rail construction bonds to pay for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, the only City Council member on the county 
commission -- which will make the final decision -- minimized the importance of 
Wednesday's council vote, saying, "I don't think there are three votes" on the 
11-member commission for placing the Valley ahead of the Pasadena and LAX 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, whose northeast Los Angeles district would be served by the Pasadena 
line, said he would not be bound by the council vote when the commission takes 
up the plan next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, even some of the most passionate proponents of the Valley rail line 
seem resigned to the commission staff's $2.2-billion plan for staggering 
construction of the three projects over the next 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude, one of the earliest proponents of a Valley Metro Rail 
extension, conceded that it might not be possible to build the Valley line 
first. But Braude nonetheless urged the council to make a "symbolic gesture" on 
behalf of the proposed Valley line by approving a motion requesting that the 
commission make building the Valley line "the No. 1 priority." 
</P>
<P>
Braude and state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) last year put together a 
coalition of business, civic and homeowner group leaders in support of the 
Metro Rail extension from North Hollywood to the San Diego Freeway along the 
Southern Pacific railroad right of way that parallels Chandler and Victory 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
A key to getting support from homeowners, who had been worried about noise from 
a ground-level system, was an agreement to place the line underground through a 
four-mile residential area of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Braude and other proponents of the Valley line did not directly respond in 
Wednesday's debate to the repeated assertion by Neil Peterson, the county 
commission's executive director, that it would make no sense to build a Valley 
extension of Metro Rail until the subway reaches North Hollywood from downtown, 
which is not scheduled to occur until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that because half the cost of the the $4-billion 
downtown-to-North Hollywood portion of Metro Rail will be paid by federal 
funds, the commission is unable to speed up the construction timetable. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Peterson's claim that completion of the downtown-to-North Hollywood 
Metro Rail segment is all but assured, council members Joel Wachs and Joy Picus 
expressed doubts that federal funds to complete the line to the Valley would be 
available, citing recent statements by the Bush Administration suggesting that 
local governments should pay a larger share of transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs warned that the commission staff's plan "dooms the Valley to failure." 
Under the 11-year construction plan, work on the Valley extension would begin 
in 1996 and be completed in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the LAX line would begin next year and be completed in 1994 at 
the same time the Century Freeway line is completed. The plan envisions work 
starting on the Pasadena line in 1994, with completion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's Transit Committee on Monday voted 3 to 1 to approve the plan's 
construction schedule, with the lone dissenter suggesting that the Pasadena 
line ought to be built before the LAX spur. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners have warned that if voters reject the June 5 transportation 
spending propositions, there probably will be only enough money for one new 
rail line in this century.

PORTER RANCH 'HIGHWAY' PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The map handed out Tuesday by a residents' group opposed to the huge Porter 
Ranch development proposal showed a dotted line slashing through the Santa 
Susana Mountains between Santa Clarita and the west San Fernando Valley, 
bearing the caption: 
</P>
<P>
"Is this where Bernson's 'secret highway' will be?" 
</P>
<P>
But whether Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson or anyone else has plans 
for an actual road was far less clear than the thick black dotted line. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, other sources cited by the protesters and county highway officials 
said either that they knew of no such plan or that it was raised as a vague 
possibility and dismissed a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The residents group, known as PRIDE, raised the issue during a news conference 
held in Chatsworth to reiterate its opposition to a proposal for nearly 6 
million square feet of commercial space in Porter Ranch, a hilly area north of 
the Simi Valley Freeway above Chatsworth. The highway -- as shown by PRIDE's 
map -- would cut through the 1,300-acre development. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Chipello, PRIDE's executive director, said his group has "heard from a 
couple of reliable sources" that "there are some plans to get a major highway 
through." 
</P>
<P>
PRIDE already is asking that a supplemental environmental study of the Porter 
Ranch proposal, which is pending before the City Council, consider the benefits 
of a less intensive project and address the "secret highway." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson spokeswoman Margaree Klein said the councilman "knows of nothing in his 
office or anybody else's office" regarding such a highway. She added: "That is 
so ludicrous he can't even comment on it." 
</P>
<P>
Chipello would not identify his sources, other than to say one had seen the 
highway on a map in Bernson's office and another had heard of it from the Rev. 
Jess Moody, pastor of a Van Nuys Baptist church that is moving to Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Moody said in an interview that he indeed had heard of such a highway, although 
he wasn't sure when. He thought it might have been last year in a speech by 
former Councilman Robert Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson, who is project coordinator for Porter Ranch developer Nathan 
Shapell, said he remembered the speech but that no such road was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson also remembered that shortly after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake damaged 
a Golden State Freeway interchange just north of the San Fernando Valley, there 
was indeed a suggestion by state planners that such a highway was needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was brought up that maybe someday, and they used the word maybe, there 
ought to be another highway on the west side of Oat Mountain" to provide an 
alternative route to the Golden State Freeway after another quake, Wilkinson 
said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego City Council committee authorized City Manager John Lockwood to 
begin negotiations with Wackenhut Corrections Corp. to build a privately 
operated 200-bed prearraignment jail at the East Otay Mesa Correctional 
Complex. 
</P>
<P>
The private jail, believed to be the first of its kind in California, would 
house misdemeanor offenders beginning Dec. 6, if the city can award a contract 
by April 9. 
</P>
<P>
The full City Council must approve. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city has not yet decided how to pay for the $6.5-million jail. 
Negotiations with the county to lease the 4 acres on East Mesa also are 
continuing. The city is seeking a state grant to pay for first-year jail costs. 
</P>
<P>
The jail would house some of the more than 100 misdemeanor offenders released 
from county jails every day because of crowding. 
</P>
<P>
A selection committee chose from among four proposals to build and operate the 
jail. Wackenhut Corrections manages 10 jails in seven states.

<P>
The recent death of a Simi Valley man, first thought to have been a homicide, 
has been ruled a suicide, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County coroner's office has determined that Christopher Fortunato, 
29, shot himself once in the head with a .22-caliber handgun in the early 
morning hours of March 5, Sgt. Tony Harper said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kari Fortunato, 31, was arrested the same day on suspicion of slaying her 
husband but was later released. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunato was found shot to death in the hallway of the couple's home in the 
1100 block of Hudson Court, police said. Officers were called to the home by a 
neighbor after the victim's wife ran to the neighbor's home to ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
Kari Fortunato, who was covered with blood, was taken to Simi Valley Adventist 
Hospital. She had been shot in the head and in both hands. Police believe the 
dead man quarreled with his wife, shot her and then shot himself. CARLOS LOZANO

OWNER JAILED FOR FAILING TO REMOVE WASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Sun Valley chemical distributing firm was sentenced Wednesday to 
six months in jail for failing to clean up chemicals after a 1985 fire that 
destroyed her plant. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the jail term, Marianne Pratter, owner of the defunct Research 
Organic &amp; Inorganic Chemical Co., was placed on three years probation and 
ordered to pay $52,000 in fines, costs and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Fred Rimerman remanded Pratter to jail, 
refusing to set bail although her attorney said she plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Pratter, 53, was convicted in December of one count of illegal disposal of 
hazardous wastes. The charge stemmed from her failure to remove chemical wastes 
after an April, 1985, fire at her plant at 9068 DeGarmo St. More than 50 
people, mostly firefighters and police, suffered dizziness and impaired 
breathing as a result of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the fire, unstable chemicals at the site began to react, and the 
Environmental Protection Agency and Coast Guard were called in to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
The federal team left behind chemicals that did not appear to pose an immediate 
health threat, and Pratter was ordered to have them removed. But she didn't, 
and county officials removed them eight months after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed the charge against 
Pratter for her failure to clean up the chemicals. "She abandoned the hazardous 
materials on the premises," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph P. Charney. "She 
basically walked away from it." 
</P>
<P>
Pratter previously operated her company in New Jersey. In 1983, a toxic gas 
leak on the company's site cost the state $1 million to clean up. The following 
year, she pleaded guilty in New Jersey to charges of reckless storage of 
hazardous materials and creating a risk of widespread injury. In that case, she 
was sentenced to three years' probation, five months of community service and a 
$15,000 fine.

"Uh, no," said Kim, playing her flashlight beam on the forbidding-looking 
opening 30 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
"Just checking," replied Bill, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
From about 1:30 a.m. to 3:30 a.m., Bill, Kim, John and Jackie worked one of the 
most unusual night jobs they may ever hold: for $7.50 an hour, they helped the 
U.S. Census Bureau count homeless people in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the four young census takers, who did not want to give their last names, 
didn't tramp along railroad tracks, muddy their feet in river washes or pick 
their way through shadowed parks. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they spent virtually their entire two-hour shift in the comfort of 
their car, searching for the homeless by shining flashlights out the windows. 
In more than 40 miles of driving, the census-takers left the car exactly twice: 
once to buy snacks at a 7-Eleven store and again to peer down at the railroad 
tunnel's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Their tally for the night: one homeless person, sleeping in a field. 
</P>
<P>
The group was among 100 freshly minted census takers dispatched in the pre-dawn 
hours to scour Valley parks, abandoned buildings, trash bins and other spots as 
part of the Census Bureau's unprecedented effort to enumerate the country's 
elusive homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
Although they said actual results won't be released until next year, local 
census officials pronounced the Valley effort a success. Census takers visited 
85 homeless gathering spots in the region during the one-night count. 
</P>
<P>
"It went very well. We accomplished all our sites and we counted as many people 
as we could count," said Tom Nowlin, who managed the census operation in most 
of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Nowlin said one census taker stepped on a nail and required a tetanus shot. But 
unlike some locations elsewhere in the country, no census employees were 
threatened in the Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nowlin declined to say how many Valley homeless were counted, but the numbers 
appeared to be low, based on interviews with census takers, who worked in 
four-person teams. In a sampling of five census teams, each reported finding 
three or fewer homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
But faced with blacked-out parks and shadowy buildings, different census takers 
seemed to approach their task with different levels of vigor. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing white vests marked "Census Taker" and hefting Thomas Bros. map books 
Juan Merchan, 28, of Canoga Park and John Burton, 33, of Sepulveda searched 
carefully on foot in their designated area. 
</P>
<P>
At Vanowen Street and Canoga Avenue, they examined a new complex of public 
storage spaces. They aimed flashlights at bushes and corners and picked up the 
lid of a trash bin to hunt for possible occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Walking on Eton Street, Merchan beamed his light into the cab of a blue pickup 
truck, prompting a man inside to pop up his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, would you like to be counted for the census?" Merchan asked the man, who 
bounded out of the truck clad in a T-shirt and undershorts. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who identified himself as Eddie, said with a smile that he had a home. 
</P>
<P>
Merchan and Burton moved on. 
</P>
<P>
At the back of an abandoned building on Canoga Avenue, Merchan and his partner 
shone their lights through holes in the wall, illuminating some blankets. They 
called inside, but got no response and left. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Bill's team appeared to make only cursory searches of possible 
homeless sites along their route, a broad corridor paralleling the Simi Valley 
Freeway between San Fernando and the Santa Susana Pass railroad tunnel west of 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The group drove through Chatsworth Park South, without getting out of their 
car, in about 90 seconds, their flashlights not penetrating the far reaches of 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the group had followed Census Bureau search policy, Nowlin said, "If 
they didn't see any people to enumerate, what was the need to get out of the 
car?" 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Hunt, founder of the San Fernando Valley Mayors' Fund for the Homeless, 
claimed that the Valley count "could not possibly" be accurate. Hunt said there 
are up to 15,000 homeless people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley is 22 miles by 11 miles by my count and that is immense," she said. 
"And when you realize that homeless people can be found in any part of the 
Valley and all the surrounding hills, how can even an army of workers locate 
them all?" 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it helps, but I most of all hope that the legislators in Washington 
will understand that whatever number is given is just the best count census 
takers could get, but it doesn't begin to be an accurate count," she said.

An Agoura man accused of attacking his wife and two Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies was arrested Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Forsberg, 45, was being held in lieu of $100,000 bail, Lt. Richard Diaz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers were sent to a house in the 600 block of Calle Argon after a 
woman called police and said she was being assaulted, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
When Deputies James T. Winstead, 34, and Ronald R. Colitti, 25, tried to 
intervene in the dispute, they were attacked by Forsberg, Diaz said. Although 
Forsberg was unarmed, the deputies received minor injuries and later were 
treated and released from Los Robles Regional Medical Center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Forsberg was arrested on suspicion of battering his wife, assaulting the two 
deputies, resisting arrest and malicious mischief in connection with damage to 
the door of a police car. PSYCHE PASCUAL

GROUP TRIES TO LOCATE THE HOMELESS, BUT FEW COME TO THEIR CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Shortly before 4 a.m., Inglewood teen-ager Brian Shuford shined his flashlight 
at a homeless person ensconced in a sleeping bag behind an Alondra Park 
restroom. But retired Hawthorne truck mechanic Henry Bulder -- like Shuford a 
temporary census taker -- shooed his 18-year-old partner away. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't wake them up," Bulder said, rejecting Shuford's argument that they 
should determine the person's sex, race and age. "It says in the book. I'll 
show you." 
</P>
<P>
Shuford and Bulder were among dozens of Census Bureau employees of divergent 
backgrounds who traversed the South Bay before dawn Wednesday in search of the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The two men and a third group member, Torrance office worker Harlon Patterson, 
33, spent their 2 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. shift driving from one reported homeless 
haunt to another in Shuford's Suzuki Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
They traveled more than 35 miles to sites ranging from the Tom Bradley 
International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport to a trash-filled 
field behind a Gardena meat market, but they managed to locate only five 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
For Patterson, it was a decided anti-climax. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we're not getting paid by the head," he said at one point, peering 
from his cramped perch in the back of the Samurai. "The three of us have been 
out for two hours, and we've counted four people so far. We haven't even found 
a stray dog." 
</P>
<P>
Their pre-dawn search began at a service station just around the corner from 
the Census Bureau's regional office in Inglewood, where a man in a dark sedan 
menacingly flashed a gang sign to the three enumerators as they pumped gas into 
the jet-black Samurai's tank. 
</P>
<P>
Shuford admitted that his low-slung vehicle did look somewhat suspicious as it 
slinked through the dark South Bay streets in search of the next homeless 
haunt. 
</P>
<P>
On the freeway, a Highway Patrol cruiser slowed down, flashed its searchlight 
at the Suzuki and then took off. Later, two sheriff's deputies eyed the vehicle 
during one pass on Hawthorne Boulevard and then drew their car alongside it 
during a second sweep of the street. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said one of the deputies rolled down his window and said to them: 
"You guys have been driving around on Hawthorne for the last 40 minutes. Are 
you lost?" 
</P>
<P>
When the enumerators stated their business, the officers looked at each other 
and left. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't had Henry around, we would've been spread-eagled against that 
car," Shuford said, smiling at the bespectacled Bulder, who at 64 provided a 
grandfatherly contrast to his two youthful companions. 
</P>
<P>
The trio made their biggest find at the airport when they discovered four 
people sleeping in chairs and tagged all of them as homeless. But their tensest 
moment came later, when they spotted a huge pile of brush dumped next to the 
San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Shuford urged his older colleagues to investigate. Patterson hesitated, then 
joined him. Bulder, toting his census forms in a May Co. shopping bag, waited 
warily on the other side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
"What's a homeless man going to do -- jump out with an Uzi?" Shuford asked as 
he crept through the bushes toward the mound. "I'm the Indiana Jones of census 
takers." 
</P>
<P>
The mound of brush was just that. There were no signs of the homeless anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before calling it quits, the group descended on Alondra Park, which at 
first glance seemed empty. But behind a restroom near the corner of Prairie 
Avenue and Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Shuford and Bulder found signs of 
habitation: a coat hanging from a tree and the owner sacked out in a sleeping 
bag several yards away. 
</P>
<P>
It was the final discovery of the evening, and for Bulder it was a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of disappointing that we didn't find more people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, reached at his office Wednesday morning, was more philosophical. "I 
expected more homelessness," he admitted, but he said he would do it all again. 
"After all, this is history. It's something I can pass on to my grandchildren 
some day."

PROSECUTORS DENY MISCONDUCT CHARGES IN MILLER SPY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers have vigorously denied that they have engaged in any 
misconduct in prosecuting espionage charges against former FBI Agent Richard 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
In January, attorneys for Miller claimed in a motion filed in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles that charges against him should be dismissed because 
prosecutors intentionally withheld information that could benefit Miller's 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
But in their response, prosecutors maintain that the defense motion "is wholly 
without merit." The defense has conveyed "a false sense of conspiracy and 
wrongdoing on the part of the government," according to the brief filed by 
Assistant U.S. Attys. Russell Hayman and Adam Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
The defense motion, prosecutors contend, is "a rehashing of . . . old issues 
with a new face," contentions that were rejected by U.S. District Judge David 
Kenyon, who presided over Miller's two trials and the trial of Soviet spy 
Svetlana Ogorodnikova, with whom Miller had an adulterous affair in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 52, was tried on espionage charges twice, with the first trial ending 
in a hung jury in 1985. The next year, a jury convicted him of trading a secret 
FBI manual to the Soviet Union for sex, money and a Burberry trench coat. It 
was the first time an FBI agent had been convicted of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction was overturned by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last 
April and he was released on bail last October. 
</P>
<P>
Miller says he was not a spy but was attempting to revive his lackluster FBI 
career with an attempt to infiltrate the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon removed himself from the case and U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi 
took over. Miller's third trial is scheduled to begin July 10. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the government response deals with a July, 1989, letter sent to FBI 
Director William Sessions by a lawyer for former FBI Agent John Hunt. Hunt was 
a witness in both of Miller's earlier trials. The letter urged Sessions to 
investigate possible FBI misconduct in the case. The letter claimed that the 
FBI omitted from Hunt's investigative reports on the case information that was 
favorable to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the issues raised by" Miller's January motion "have been aired" during 
the earlier trials, the prosecutors retorted. "The defense has long been aware 
of Mr. Hunt's view" that his report had been inaccurately summarized and "has 
cross-examined him on this issue in all proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors also maintain that the FBI conducted an in-depth investigation 
of the case. "The fact that the FBI did not back away from a prosecution of one 
of its own agents is a clear testament to its objectivity and single-minded 
pursuit of the criminal actors," the prosecution response states. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the prosecution motion maintains that much of the information 
contained in the letter from Hunt's lawyer, Lynn Sarko of Seattle, tends to 
incriminate Miller rather than exonerate him. And the prosecutors state that 
they have turned over to Miller's lawyers all relevant information that could 
aid his defense. 
</P>
<P>
In reply, Joel Levine, one of Miller's lawyers, asserted that prosecutors have 
"mischaracterized many of the things we were attempting to say." He said that a 
number of issues were raised by the July, 1989, letter that the prosecutors did 
not deal with in their response. 
</P>
<P>
Levine and his co-counsel, Stanley I. Greenberg, said they plan to file a 
detailed written reply and hope that Judge Takasugi will grant a hearing so 
that the issues they have raised can be further explored before Miller's trial. 
Takasugi is scheduled to hear the misconduct motion on June 11.

COUPLE JOLTED FROM BED AS POWERFUL PIPE BOMB DAMAGES HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A powerful pipe bomb tore through the front door of a couple's home in La Verne 
before dawn on Wednesday, shattering windows, scattering furniture and 
perforating the walls with dozens of metal shards from the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Clark, 32, and his wife, Kathleen Fraser, 42, both of whom are educators in 
the La Verne area, were jolted from their bed by the blast. But despite 
extensive damage to their bedroom, neither sustained serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Honest to God, I thought it was World War III," Fraser told a reporter a few 
hours later. "The whole house just imploded. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There were little embers glowing all over the living room," she said. "There 
was a taste of sulfur in the air. It looked -- and it smelled -- like the 
Fourth of July in there." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the couple nor police, or any neighbors interviewed, could offer any 
explanation for the blast. 
</P>
<P>
"The police said the bomb was placed, not thrown, right on the doorstep," Clark 
said. "They said it seemed to be placed so it wouldn't kill us, more of a scare 
tactic." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if they wanted to scare us, they did a real good job," Fraser said. "Now 
the people who did it have got to tell us why. We're not into drugs. We're not 
into gangs. We don't owe anyone money. . . . No enemies. No threats. We're 
teachers -- real normal people." 
</P>
<P>
Fraser, who is an instructor at a local institution for mentally retarded 
adults, said she and Clark, a teacher at a local elementary school, had been 
asleep in their bedroom at the front of the small home they rent in the 2300 
block of East 2nd Street when Clark got up at about 3 a.m. to visit the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
"While he was gone, I heard something -- I guess it was outside -- but at the 
time I thought it was Tim," she said. "Then he got back in bed. We were both 
just dozing off when it hit. The noise was phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
La Verne police said their preliminary investigation indicated that the bomb 
consisted of a metal pipe filled with gunpowder. Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department bomb squad experts, called in to assist in the investigation, 
declined comment on their initial findings. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart, 32, who lives across the street from the Clark-Fraser home, said 
the blast tossed him "right out of bed". Shawn Scriven, 21, who lives next door 
to Stewart, said the explosion awakened him but he couldn't figure out right 
away what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought it was a dream," Scriven said. "Then I realized it was too 
realistic to be a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said neighbors gathered across the street from where the explosion 
occurred as the patrol cars they had summoned by phone began to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne Police Lt. Larry Smith said the officers ordered Clark, Fraser and 
about half a dozen of their neighbors out of their homes while a search was 
made for other explosives. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting out there in my nightgown," Fraser said. "I noticed that there 
was a fragment of glass embedded in my hand, but it wasn't too bad. 
</P>
<P>
"It must have been two hours later before I came out of it," she added. "I 
suddenly realized, 'I don't have any clothes on!" 
</P>
<P>
She said she and Clark, who have known each other for years, huddled together 
as the sun began to rise, wondering aloud why someone had bombed their home. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him, 'What's in your past?' "she recalled with a wry chuckle. "He 
asked me the same thing. . . . Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Smith said that as of Wednesday afternoon, no communications had been 
received from anyone claiming responsibility for the blast. While one police 
officer suggested that the attackers had simply bombed the wrong home, Smith 
said there was no evidence that anyone else in the neighborhood might have been 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice, quiet town," Smith said. "It's the first incident of that type 
here. This is the kind of town where you can still walk down the street 
(safely) at night." 
</P>
<P>
But while Smith tended to discount the "wrong house" theory, Clark said he was 
inclined to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the bomb was meant for some other house," he said. "I just hope that 
the people who did this realize that they goofed."

ANTI-DRUG BARRICADES TAKEN OFF THE STREETS; 
</P>
<P>
CLOSURE: A 12-BLOCK AREA OF A SEPULVEDA NEIGHBORHOOD IS REOPENED. POLICE AND 
RESIDENTS AGREE THAT DEALING DECLINED DURING THE EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Barricades installed temporarily across streets in a Sepulveda neighborhood two 
months ago to keep drug dealers out have been removed, with Los Angeles police 
saying the effort has been a success -- so far. 
</P>
<P>
The sawhorse barriers were removed Monday from the neighborhood bounded by 
Orion Avenue, Nordhoff Street, Langdon Avenue and Parthenia Street. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 18, the 12-block area was closed off except for one entrance, on Rayen 
Street, in an effort to halt drive-through drug sales. Twice a day, barriers on 
other streets were removed by police for buses from Langdon Avenue Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The street closures followed by three months the permanent barricading of a 
similar-sized neighborhood along nearby Columbus Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jim Whitley said Wednesday that the Orion neighborhood barricade was 
planned only as a temporary measure because problems there were not as severe 
as in the Columbus neighborhood. In fact, police said, some of the Orion area's 
problems were caused by drug dealers driven out of the Columbus neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But eight weeks after the sawhorses were erected in the Orion area, the drug 
activity has receded, police and residents agreed. Although statistics were 
unavailable, Whitley estimated that drug dealing in the neighborhood has 
dropped by 75% and other crime by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
The Orion neighborhood will be closely monitored, Whitley added, as police and 
residents wait to see if the change will last. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the plan," Whitley said. "We will use our traditional police methods to 
watch the place. If the problems come back, we will bring back the barricades." 
</P>
<P>
Those who live or work in the area mostly had a wait-and-see attitude toward 
the removal of the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
"When the barricades were up it was beautiful here," said Nick Notarangelo, a 
resident manager of an apartment building. "Now I don't know what will happen. 
We'll have to see." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Balderrama, principal of Langdon Elementary School, said he had watched 
drug dealers operate openly on the streets outside the school, but the 
barricades eliminated the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug trafficking definitely dropped way down," Balderrama said. "I think there 
is still some going on, but I don't think I have seen any open dealing. The 
visibility of it is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Balderrama said, however, that although the barricades kept drug dealers out, 
they allowed gang members to congregate more freely. The principal said the 
barriers limited police patrol cars access to the one entrance at Rayen Street. 
Gangs could post a lookout near that entry while others congregated on the 
traffic-free streets inside the barricaded neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The gangs were really getting very open," Balderrama said. "They were very 
cocky, hanging around the school. They only had to watch one street for the 
police. So I feel pretty good about the barricades coming down." 
</P>
<P>
Whitley replied, however, that the gang problem was not related to the 
barricades. He said gang members live in an apartment building near the school, 
and would have congregated there "whether we had barricades or not. We are 
working on correcting it." 
</P>
<P>
The use of barricades is an untraditional law enforcement method that Los 
Angeles police began to use sparingly in areas of the city last year. Whitley 
said the Columbus neighborhood was targeted for permanent barricades because 
its problems were extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbus had a Valley-wide and, to some degree, a city-wide reputation as a 
place where people can buy drugs," Whitley said. "So we have a long-term plan 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Whitley said apartment owners and local businesses have raised nearly $6,000 to 
pay for permanent barriers with gates for firetrucks. Police report that drug 
dealing and other crime have dropped sharply since the barricades went up 
there, too.

COLLEGE TRUSTEE'S RECORDS AUDITED

An Oxnard accounting firm began auditing the records Wednesday of a Ventura 
Community College District trustee who allegedly has incurred large gambling 
debts in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Merideth, a partner of the firm of Soares, Sandall, Bernacchi &amp; 
Petrovich, said the firm was notified of its selection by the district Tuesday, 
and accountants began poring over the expense records of Trustee Tom Ely at the 
district's Ventura office Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be doing our work and reporting to the board in the next few 
weeks," Merideth said. The firm expects to have completed its audit by the 
district's next board meeting on April 3, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Merideth said the firm would be looking at "reimbursement-type expense 
records." District officials said the audit will examine Ely's records, 
including telephone and travel expenses. The Board of Trustees unanimously 
authorized the audit at a board retreat in Simi Valley last week. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, 54, a board trustee since 1979, is running in the county supervisorial 
race to represent the 4th District. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors Wednesday indicted three more people on drug-related 
charges stemming from an undercover drug buy that went awry and led to a 
shoot-out with federal agents last October in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the new indictment were Stephen G. Kiba, 32; his wife, Kathleeen 
Robecca Kiba, 25, and Leroy Turner, 31, all of San Diego, federal prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard David Gold, 32, of San Diego, was indicted last November on charges of 
attempted murder and five other counts. Two others -- Michael J. Clapp, 31, and 
William B. Chambers, 30, both of San Diego -- were also indicted last November, 
each on two drug-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation that led to the indictment of all six was triggered last Oct. 
30, when Gold allegedly offered to sell 4 pounds of methamphetamine for $30,000 
to an undercover agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration in a Pacific 
Beach parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
When agents moved in to arrest Gold, he tried to flee in a car and shot at a 
DEA agent, who shot back, shattering a window whose shards wounded Gold, 
according to Assistant U.S. Atty. D. Thomas Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation of the shooting led to Clapp and Chambers, then to the Kibas 
and Turner, Ferraro said. The most recent indictment includes a variety of 
charges. All six are charged with conspiracy to make and possess 
methamphetamine, Ferraro said.

<P>
Seven members of the Black Federation picketed San Diego police headquarters 
Wednesday to protest what they call a hasty pronouncement of murder-suicide in 
deaths of two San Diego city schools' administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the federation, which provides community services, also plan to 
picket the police station today, said Herb Cawthorne, chief executive officer 
of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The pickets and other black community leaders object to police officials' 
preliminary conclusion that George Frey, 57, an assistant superintendent, 
killed Elizabeth (Betty) Tomblin, 43, director of the program evaluations 
department, and then shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
The two bodies were found early Sunday in Frey's home. Frey, who had been 
divorced three times, and Tomblin, who is married, had a romantic relationship, 
friends and police say. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary findings were released after a 10-hour investigation. Police 
officials say the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to make sure they carry out their pledge," Cawthorne said. "We 
just want them to know that simple (public relations) is not enough."

RACIAL REMARKS HURT EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The education of our children is in dire straits! As a teacher at Hawthorne 
High School, I know the school climate is in turmoil. The educational 
environment grows increasingly negative each day. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has been created by a growing conflict between professional staff 
who are divided along racial lines. Specifically, the division of the staff has 
been manifested with racial remarks, accusations and statements that are 
resulting in serious damage to the educational climate in our district. 
</P>
<P>
The California state Legislature has recognized the need for increasing numbers 
of professional educators who represent ethnic minorities in our society. 
Recent experience has shown that there is a reaction and backlash by members of 
the majority group whenever minority members are in a position of authority. We 
encourage our children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance every day. This 
pledge concludes with the statement " . . . with liberty and justice for all." 
Apparently, many majority group educators have failed to accept our nation's 
creed. There seems to be great difficulty in accepting liberty and justice for 
black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Too often when black Americans work to advance themselves in our society, other 
Americans take a united stand to negate the progress of these educators whose 
skin color happens to be different. Our Constitution states: "That all men are 
created equal." Our challenge today, at this critical time in our history, is 
to live up to our nation's creed and the Constitution of the United States of 
America.

WOODBURY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IS DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woodbury University dedicated a library Wednesday housed in a renovated former 
chapel at the school's Burbank campus. 
</P>
<P>
The 14,000-square-foot library has been open since 1987, when renovations were 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies on campus Wednesday included naming the structure the Los Angeles 
Times Library in recognition of a $200,000 contribution from the Times Mirror 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation prepared the chapel, built in 1950, and chapel office annex to 
hold the university's collection of more than 120,000 books and periodicals. 
The chapel was a remnant of the former Villa Cabrini Academy, a Catholic school 
for girls. Woodbury University moved to the campus from downtown Los Angeles 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Two Woodbury alumni who majored in interior design planned the renovation, 
which cost about $500,000, said Woodbury spokeswoman Karen B. Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
"When you walk in, there's still a kind of awesome feeling about it," she said. 
"They still have some of the stained glass there and some of the original 
lighting fixtures." 
</P>
<P>
Areas of the former chapel house reference books and a study area. The annex, 
built in 1959, has reading rooms and book stacks. 
</P>
<P>
Other foundations that have contributed to Woodbury's capital fund include: the 
William Randolph Hearst Foundation, the Weingart Foundation, the Roy Disney 
Family Foundation, the Lockheed Corporation and the Security Pacific 
Foundation.

FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your staff really missed the boat when writing about the trials and 
tribulations of California libraries. In the accompanying article about the 
national library scene, a table showing per capita expenditures for public 
libraries appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, with $4.04 per capita was sixth in the nation and No. 1 in California 
(in this probably abbreviated table). Not one mention of Pasadena appears in 
the article! 
</P>
<P>
Why not write about what an enlightened community can do when guided by an 
exceptional library director, a thoughtful city manager and an intelligent 
board of directors (city council). Attempts have been made in the distant past 
to "economize" at the expense of the library system but the citizens of 
Pasadena have beaten them back. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Public Library Foundation will, this year, complete a $2.6-million 
fund-raising effort (no tax funds involved) which has been used to refurbish 
the central library and (more important) create an endowment to ensure the 
future maintenance of the "refurbishments." 
</P>
<P>
I would suggest that maintenance of this relatively high per capita tax support 
and the fund-raising effort exemplify a unique approach to library financing.

A BOUQUET OF 'IRISES' FOR ART LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vincent van Gogh's masterpiece "Irises" has been returned to the art lovers of 
the world, thanks to the intervention of the J. Paul Getty Museum. It is an 
exciting addition to the imaginative collection of that great institution. 
Happily, the museum has wasted no time in placing the painting on public view. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition by Getty ends a troubling but instructive period in which the 
painting disappeared from public view for more than two years, first to a 
private office wall and then to a secret vault. It was the captive of Alan 
Bond, an Australian business baron. His purchase had been facilitated by 
Sotheby's New York auction house, which accepted the painting as collateral for 
a loan that the auction company itself advanced to cover half the record price 
of $53.9 million paid at its own auction. The disquiet inspired by this novel 
application of leveraged purchasing, and its bald contribution to art 
inflation, has at least won a change of policy from Sotheby's, which no longer 
will accept paintings as collateral for credit extended by the company in its 
own sales. That move could help make prices more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Irises" has been hidden in private collections more than it has been on public 
display in the years since it was painted in 1889. But from 1975 until its sale 
to Bond in 1987, it was on loan for display at the art gallery at Westbrook 
College in Portland, Me. The then-owner, John Whitney Payson, subsequently 
decided to auction it to raise money for a philanthropic foundation. His 
decision was inspired by the earlier sale of Van Gogh's painting of sunflowers 
for $39.9 million, a record at the time. The extraordinary price paid by Bond 
exceeded all expectations. And, were it not for extraordinary business reverses 
the next year, which have generated a $5-billion debt for Bond's enterprises, 
the painting might still be hanging in an office in Perth instead of in the 
Getty in Malibu.

FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chaos facing libraries created by inadequate funding is well-depicted in 
the comprehensive coverage by Larry Green and Tracy Shryer. I was pleased to 
see recognition given to the public library as the people's university. 
</P>
<P>
In higher education, the library has long been acclaimed as being the heart of 
the institution. 
</P>
<P>
And in a special library, the educational role of the special librarian is 
finally coming into its own. No matter where, librarians are essentially 
educators, for it is within their inherent training to utilize the tools of 
education on behalf of their clientele. The free flow of information is, of 
course, absolutely essential in a democracy. As a lifelong special librarian, I 
finally realized that the problem seems to be in that very word -- free. It 
dates back to the free public libraries of philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. 
Those who slash library budgets need to be updated: There are no free lunches; 
somebody has to pay the piper.

FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former librarian in Northern California, your two articles on public 
libraries (Part A, March 12) brought back some unhappy memories. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years I managed a branch library serving a population of 30,000 in 
Butte County. 
</P>
<P>
When I started in 1978, I turned in 13 time cards including regular staff, CETA 
workers, and part-time help. When I left in 1986, one step ahead of being laid 
off, my branch was down to 3 staff and 25 volunteers. Now, apparently, all 
libraries in Butte County are mothballed. Your article does not delve into the 
causes of the great disparity between library services in the rural counties 
and the urban areas of this state. I see two basic problems: 
</P>
<P>
1. Most libraries in rural areas are county libraries and county governments 
have been affected most by Proposition 13. Municipalities are relatively 
well-off because they rely on the sales tax and not the property tax. 
</P>
<P>
2. The post-Proposition 13 bailout by the state favored the spendthrift urban 
counties to the detriment of the historically parsimonious rural counties. 
Butte County, for example, since 1978 has almost always received less per 
capita from the state than any other county. 
</P>
<P>
Until our state government provides adequate funding for all county 
governments, rural or urban, there will continue to be "have" and "have-not" 
public libraries in California.

We are currently involved in a very tough knowledge war and our "Education 
President" is proposing to substantially hinder our efforts by cutting federal 
library funding by 71%. The winners in this war will be those countries who are 
strongest between the ears. 
</P>
<P>
Our competitors are very formidable -- Western Europe, Canada, Japan, the 
industrialized countries of Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Coming on fast are 
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. We must remember that Sir Francis Bacon 
said, "Knowledge is power," and not diminish our power.

President Bush, please look again. If you can find money in the defense budget 
to send to Panama and Nicaragua, there surely must be enough money available to 
fully fund our libraries.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WHO ATTACKED PROSTITUTES SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lake Los Angeles man was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years and eight months in 
prison for a series of assaults on prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Kenneth Singer, 44, was convicted in November of sexual assault, 
kidnaping and false imprisonment stemming from the 1988 abductions of four 
prostitutes from South-Central Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The crimes took place between May and October of 1988. Victims testified that 
Singer drove them against their will to remote canyon areas off the Antelope 
Valley Freeway near Agua Dulce and assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted him on several charges, including allegations that he 
threatened the women with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Cynthia Ulfig asked Lancaster Superior Court Judge Margaret 
M. Grignon to impose the maximum sentence of 12 years and four months, citing 
probation and psychological reports that described Singer as dangerous to women 
and unrepentant. 
</P>
<P>
Although Grignon said the severity of the crimes was an aggravating factor, the 
judge said she took into account Singer's lack of a previous criminal record in 
imposing the mid-term sentence of 10 years and eight months, Ulfig said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense submitted its own psychological profile describing Singer as a 
troubled man needing intensive psychotherapy rather than incarceration.

PYTHON MOVIE

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning the "resignation under pressure" (Metro Digest, March 10) of the 
seventh-grade Pasadena science teacher, Peter Connolly, for showing the Monty 
Python movie "The Meaning of Life" -- which included 2 seconds of partial 
nudity -- all we can say is shame, shame, shame onthe Pasadena Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The brainy juxtapositions that trademark the Python's humor can only be 
regarded as an inspired educational idea. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly's dismissal is a depressing and colorless move at a time when a 
premium has gotto be put on creativity in our schools.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PETITION ON CONDO STANDARDS IS FILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Lawndale residents this week filed a petition that seeks to place on 
the ballot the less-strict condominium standards passed last month by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the group said the petition contained 1,081 signatures, or 140 
more than the 941 needed to let voters decide whether to affirm the condominium 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
An official with the county registrar of voters said it will take no more than 
30 days to verify the signatures. There are 9,405 registered voters in 
Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
The standards, adopted by the council Feb. 15 on a 3-2 vote, would permit 
condominiums on lots previously zoned only for apartments or single-family 
homes. The standards eliminate the 10,000-square-foot minimum lot requirement 
for condominiums. They have been replaced with requirements for setbacks, open 
space and parking that are somewhat stricter than those for apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Robert Owen said the new condominium standards 
automatically were suspended Monday when the petition was accepted at City 
Hall. If county officials do not verify at least 975 signatures, the standards 
would be reinstated.

<P>
I am writing to commend your editorial judgment in deciding to run a photo and 
prominent headline on the front page (March 6) regarding two Southland students 
winning Westinghouse science prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this reflects your paper's priorities or just a slow news day, I think 
it's terrific that you decided to give such prominent play to an education 
story. 
</P>
<P>
I'm certainly not advocating that you take a USA Today "happy news" approach to 
your paper, but as the husband of an Inglewood elementary schoolteacher I 
greatly appreciate your role in bringing public attention to positive academic 
stories such as this one.

</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: A WARNING FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON SHOULD BE HEEDED ANEW: IT IS OUR 
FRIENDS WHO COST US MORE DEARLY THAN OUR ENEMIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY G. SUMMERS JR., Col. Harry G. Summers Jr. held the Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur Chair at the Army War College and was an adviser to the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Eastern Europe throws off its shackles, now's the time for the United States 
to shed its chains as well. For almost 50 years we have been in a bondage 
eloquently described by President George Washington in his farewell address of 
1796. Usually dismissed as a caution against entangling alliances, his remarks 
actually warned of a much more insidious danger. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more essential," he said, "than that permanent, inveterate 
antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others 
should be excluded. . . . The nation which indulges toward another an habitual 
hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its 
animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray 
from its duty and its interests." 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, our allies more than our adversaries have been the ones who have 
led us away from our real interests. Our animosity to the Communist Bloc led us 
to see the world as a zero-sum game in which allies became counters in the 
win-lose equation. The more allies you had, the better you were doing. 
Realizing the power that gave them, many of our so-called friends became adept 
at using the threat of encroaching communism to bilk the United States at every 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the Army War College conducted a study on the effectiveness of 
U.S. security assistance and found that, for all the billions expended, the 
United States had purchased few friends and precious little influence. Further, 
in many cases, reverse influence had developed, "making it difficult for the 
United States to disengage from a relationship which no longer serves U.S. 
interests." These nations had become, in Stanley Karnow's phrase, "puppets who 
pulled their own strings." 
</P>
<P>
With the attenuation of the Soviet threat, now is the time to cut those strings 
and divest ourselves of "allies" who continue to beggar and enslave us. As 
Washington said, "a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a 
variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation (facilitates) the illusion 
of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists 
and . . . leads also to concessions . . . of privileges denied to others." 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to substitute practicality for passion. 
</P>
<P>
Using American interests as the litmus test, do we really need to put up with 
Spanish and Greek blackmail to maintain bases in the Mediterranean, bases whose 
usefulness is now in question? And do we really need to put up with the insults 
of Philippine officials and their unseemly demands for ransom for our bases 
there? With America's opening to the People's Republic of China almost two 
decades ago, the Philippines' strategic usefulness has passed. The days of 
extortion are over, and those who try it should be told to take the bases and 
do with them what they may. 
</P>
<P>
The days of the United States as nattering nanny are over as well. Although 
then talking about Europe, George Washington could have been talking about the 
Middle East today when he warned "she must be engaged in frequent 
controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. 
Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial 
ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics. 
</P>
<P>
With his words in mind, why are we paying more than $3 billion in foreign aid 
each year to Israel and another $2 billion to Egypt, now that the chances of 
Soviet encroachment in the area are almost nil? The likelihood of the Soviet 
Union's arming Syria and Iraq for another Arab-Israeli war is fast diminishing. 
Why, then, is the Middle East peace process an American responsibility? After 
all the grief he caught over his recent remarks about East Jerusalem, George 
Bush ought to take the words of George Washington to heart and opt out, thereby 
encouraging the region to grow up and settle its own problems. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in constructing a viable post-Cold War strategy should be to cut 
through the animosities and affections that have grown up in the course of that 
Cold War and to rediscover and build on our true national interests. But, as 
Washington pointed out, that will not be easy. We are still plagued by 
"ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens who devote themselves to the favorite 
nation" and who have the "facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of 
their own country without odium." 
</P>
<P>
We must wake up and turn a jaundiced eye toward our so-called friends. The rest 
of the world is throwing off its chains. It's time we Americans did so as well.

FROM PRESIDENTIAL BETRAYAL TO VINDICATION; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: THE ELECTORAL DEFEAT OF THE SANDINISTAS SOFTENS THE PAIN OF AN 
UNGRATEFUL AND SILENT RONALD REAGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL R. (SPITZ) CHANNELL, Carl R. (Spitz) Channell, conservative fund-raiser 
and former member of the Oliver North network and conservative fund-raiser, is 
raising money to promote democracy in Eastern Europe and Central America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the release of Ronald Reagan's videotaped testimony for the trial of his 
former national security adviser, John M. Poindexter, many conservatives who 
had worked for freedom in Nicaragua were hopeful. Might the former President 
use the opportunity to acknowledge his leadership of our noble but 
misinterpreted struggle? 
</P>
<P>
My participation had cost me: I'd endured a media "trial," the trial of Oliver 
L. North (I was a prosecution witness) and a trial of my own. I was the first 
to plead in the Iran-Contra affair -- guilty of conspiring to defraud the 
government by soliciting tax-deductible funds for non-deductible purposes -- 
for which I paid a $50 fine and received two years of probation. Since 
disclosure of the affair, it has been years of humiliation, alienation, loss of 
career, personal financial ruin and growing self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Other devoured "children" of the Reagan Revolution -- "my contributors," I 
shall call them -- felt similarly betrayed by their leader. Our relationship 
can be characterized as a cross between the camaraderie of combat soldiers and 
the emotional bonds binding a dispersed but close family. Our commitment to 
each other was -- and is -- only exceeded by our commitment to The Cause. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, we felt, Ronald Reagan, at last free of the constraints of office and 
his legion of cowardly advisers, would testify that he had solicited and 
encouraged us to join The Cause. It was time for him to acknowledge what he had 
told us in scores of small and large meetings. He at least owed us that. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the Iran-Contra affair, my contributors individually resumed 
financial support for the Nicaraguan freedom fighters. They gave money to the 
defense funds of North, Poindexter and Richard V. Secord. Though not immune to 
the media presumption of a Sandinista victory in the elections last month, they 
contributed to the campaign of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, candidate of the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Reagan's strange silence continued to test our faith. Some blamed 
Nancy. Others began questioning the former President's commitment not only to 
the struggle for freedom in Central America, but also to anti-communism, 
traditional values and the other issues that had drawn us to his side. Was the 
man who had watched in silence as the government -- his government -- pilloried 
North and who had abandoned so many others nothing more than a glib politician? 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 25, Reagan, shrouded in mists of forgetfulness, gently sealed the door 
of hope shut. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Christian, a Kentucky patriot who could always muster another ounce of 
energy or another generous check for a pro-democracy cause, told me, "Perhaps 
I'll just take a long drive around the West." 
</P>
<P>
John Ramsey, a Wichita Falls, Tex., businessman, whose commitment to freedom in 
Nicaragua included plans to join the Contras in the jungle, said: "It's time I 
forget politics and get back to concentrating on my business." 
</P>
<P>
The gentle and deeply religious Pentecost family in San Angelo, Tex., called 
their commitment "wasted." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Evelyn Taylor, another Texan, prepared to concentrate her energies on 
promoting a religious revival in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Some hid their hurt and betrayal by blanking out all thoughts of what seemed to 
be the lost crusade in Central America. The feelings of others turned to anger. 
To their mind, Reagan had betrayed staff, supporters and The Cause. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the miracle: ELECTION UPSET IN NICARAGUA. 
</P>
<P>
Our phone lines buzzed. We all wanted to know whether the news of Chamorro's 
victory over Daniel Ortega was some sort of electronic aberration at our local 
television stations. It wasn't, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the slanders of irresponsible journalists, the presumptions of guilt 
by prosecutors, the snickers of those who thought our hope for Nicaraguan 
freedom "quaint" and even the pain caused by Ronald Reagan -- all were washed 
away. I felt cleansed in a religious sense. 
</P>
<P>
My and my contributors' optimism was back. A small group of dedicated patriots 
could make a difference. All that talk about long drives in the West, family 
business and dropping out of politics gave way to discussions of new crusades, 
new support for the cause of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Christian, Ramsey, the Pentecosts, Taylor and thousands of other conservative 
warriors: We're back!

Citing insufficient evidence, prosecutors on Wednesday said they will not file 
criminal charges against two young men who had been suspected of killing a 
9-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne O. Hobbs, 19, and Richard LaLonde, 18, had been suspected in the murder 
of Jason Matthew Lea of Upland, whose partly decomposed body was found last 
Aug. 4 at the bottom of a cliff near the Mt. Baldy ski area. "While witnesses 
place the suspects in the company of the victim earlier in the evening of his 
disappearance, there is no evidence linking the suspects to his death," Pomona 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Hearnsberger wrote in a memo. Jason disappeared July 29 
after leaving home on his bicycle.

To me it doesn't make any difference whether Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's 
announcement regarding RU 486 was politically motivated or not; it was still a 
brilliant idea.

Here we are living in supposedly the most industrialized nation in the world 
and are stopped by a few religious zealots. Hopefully, this will be something 
the state can proudly point to as a progressive move not only for women, but 
for all people suffering breast cancer, prostate cancer and Cushing's syndrome.

JAZZ PROVES TOO MUCH FOR CLIPPERS, 118-102;

<P>
CLIPPERS: MALONE OUTLASTS DEFENSE TO SCORE 28 POINTS. UTAH BECOMES THIRD

Karl Malone had scored only four points and no rebounds, and it was no real 
surprise that the Clippers were leading the Utah Jazz, 29-21, after the first 
quarter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And, to Malone, it was no surprise that he finished with 28 points, only three 
below his average, which is second in the NBA. Also, it was no surprise that 
the Jazz beat the Clippers, 118-102, and clinched a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Malone said the Clippers stopped him in the first quarter with the same kind of 
defense other teams have tried. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been something I've been faced with all year, double- and triple-teamed," 
he said. "But I'll let you in on a little secret -- they'll wear out before I 
will." 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't worn out yet. Nor has John Stockton, who scored 23 points and sparked 
a fourth-quarter spurt to take control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Utah led, 87-86, with 7:55 left when Stockton's three-point shot started a 20-6 
run to move to a 107-92 advantage with 2:23 to play. Darrell Griffith had 10 of 
his 17 points during the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton was the catalyst to another spurt, this in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles led, 38-26, early in the second quarter. Stockton started a 13-2 
run that later tied it, 42-42. 
</P>
<P>
"Stockton made about three great plays in a row," Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said. 
"We were trying to find a way to win. It wouldn't have happened if we didn't do 
something defensively." 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz, leading the Midwest Division at 48-19, joined the Lakers and the 
Portland Trail Blazers as Western Conference teams in the playoffs. Utah is 
three games ahead of the San Antonio Spurs in the Midwest Division and has won 
22 of its last 23 games in the Salt Palace. The Jazz's home record of 31-4 is 
second best in the NBA behind the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Thurl Bailey added 21 for the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were led by Winston Garland's 23 points and dropped their third 
consecutive road game to fall to 26-41. They are 9-26 away from the Sports 
Arena. The Clippers have lost eight of their last nine road games. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith had 20 points for the Clippers and Ken Norman 17.

CELTICS, 76ERS MAKE IT JUST LIKE OLD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Atlantic Division, which not so long ago seemed to be a domain ruled by the 
New York Knicks, is back on familiar ground. 
</P>
<P>
As it has been most of the years there have been four divisions, the Atlantic 
is once again a battle between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, who won it last season and dominated it most of this one, are still 
in contention. But on top of their other problems, they learned Charles Oakley, 
their power forward, is out for the rest of the season. The slumping Knicks are 
in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
With Larry Bird playing as well as he did before Achilles' tendon problems all 
but wiped out his 1988-89 season, the Celtics seem ready to challenge the 
76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Bird had his second consecutive triple-double Wednesday night at Boston and the 
Celtics romped to their third victory in a row, beating Cleveland, 123-114. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers also won, as expected at home against Miami, and lead the Celtics by 
1 1/2 games. But this is not the same Boston team that struggled through the 
first couple months. 
</P>
<P>
Bird had been playing well but shooting poorly. His shooting touch came back 
recently and it has given the whole team a lift. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-9 forward was 11 for 16, had 25 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds to 
make sure the Cavaliers' winning streak ended at five games. Bird made his 
first seven shots and the Cavaliers fell behind in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Since Bird's touch returned, the Celtics have won five of six. At the same 
time, the Celtics put veteran Kevin McHale back into the starting lineup and he 
has reached back for something extra, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics are playing the way they did throughout the '80s when they won all 
but one Atlantic title. One problem: They have two games left with the 76ers 
and both are at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry initiates 85 to 90% of our offense. He opens up everything," McHale 
said. "When he was shooting poorly, we struggled. Now, he has given us all 
confidence. They have to double up on him, so someone's always open. It's fun 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 118, Miami 97 -- It was a night for Charles Barkley to take it 
easy at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat was without center Rony Seikaly, who has a virus, and Miami never 
presented a real threat. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley played only 34 minutes and mostly watched as Hersey Hawkins and others 
did the work. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins scored 12 of his 25 points in the third quarter, which ended with the 
76ers coasting, 84-73. The Heat is only 6-28 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 112, Milwaukee 96 -- A few days ago, the Pacers were in a terrible 
slump and were in danger of dropping out of playoff contention. They couldn't 
even win at home. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday night at Miami, the Pacers played their best game in a month. They 
followed that up with an even better performance against the Bucks at 
Indianapolis and ended their three-game home losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers made their first 13 shots and the Bucks were never in the game. The 
front line of Detlef Schrempf, Chuck Person and Rik Smits accounted for 78 
points, making 35 of 48 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers (33-34) are seventh in the East. To make the playoffs, they must 
finish ahead of either Atlanta (31-35) or Cleveland (30-35). 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 99, Atlanta 89 -- This loss at home was a blow to the Hawks' playoff 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks led, 78-73, entering the fourth quarter, and were still even with 
five minutes to play. But Michael Jordan (27 points), still hampered by a 
jammed thumb, made two free throws and a jumper to give the Bulls the lead for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 115, Phoenix 114 -- Dell Curry scored five of his 28 points in 
overtime and the Hornets shocked the Suns. It was only the third win in 33 road 
games for the Hornets, but their second in the last three on this trip. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns had won 19 consecutive home games before losing to San Antonio Monday 
night. They now have a 27-7 record at home. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, they miss guard Jeff Hornacek and swingman Dan Majerle, both lost 
for the rest of the season because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers, playing despite a hamstring injury, had 36 points for the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 136, New Jersey 106 -- Ledell Eackles, filling in for injured Jeff 
Malone, scored a career-high 40 points at Landover, Md., and the Bullets handed 
the Nets their 21st defeat in a row on the road. The Bullets ended a four-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 90, Minnesota 84 -- Rodney McCray was eight for eight from the field 
and the Kings handed the Timberwolves their 21st consecutive loss on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Pervis Ellison had his best game for the Kings, scoring 18 points. DAN

How much would Michael Jordan be worth in a trade? Clipper owner Donald 
Sterling once offered owner Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago Bulls $25 million 
and several first-round draft choices for Jordan and was promptly turned down. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will be the underdog to Duke tonight, but it was an underdog, too, in 1964 
when it won its first NCAA basketball tournament championship game. Led by Walt 
Hazzard and Gail Goodrich, the Bruins upset Jeff Mullins and the Blue Devils, 
98-83, in Kansas City, Mo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount is the sentimental favorite, but many college basketball 
people would like to see the class act that is North Carolina's Dean Smith keep 
winning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A lot of fans who brought cameras to the Forum to take pictures of Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar when his Laker jersey was retired also got shots of Bo Kimble. 
Between posing and signing autographs, the Loyola Marymount star hardly had 
time to watch the game, but seemed to enjoy the attention. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another jersey that belongs on the Forum wall along with those of Abdul-Jabbar, 
Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain and Rogie Vachon is Marcel Dionne's. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Xavier Coach Pete Gillen and David Letterman. . . .

How much has media coverage of the NCAA tournament grown? The Forum's Bob 
Steiner, then working for the University of California, remembers stapling 
together some sheets of paper at the last minute that served as the press book 
for the few out-of-town reporters who covered the Final Four at San Francisco's 
Cow Palace in 1960. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is supposed to be a down year for the Atlantic Coast Conference, so I 
guess that's why it has only four teams in the sweet 16. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Not unlike the pros, the coach who wins the college basketball championship 
rarely is voted coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The last was Bobby Knight of Indiana in 1976. Of course, the ballot boxes close 
before the tournament starts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the NCAA did Cal State Long Beach a favor. The 49ers wouldn't have lasted 
long in the big tournament. At least, they got an all-expenses paid trip to 
Hawaii out of the National Invitation Tournament. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The NBA playoffs don't begin until three weeks after the NCAA tournament ends. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Austin Carr of Notre Dame holds the tournament single-game scoring record of 61 
points against Ohio University in the first round in 1970. But the all-time 
best performance might have been the 44-point outburst by Bill Walton of UCLA 
against Memphis State in the 1973 championship game, when he made 21 of 22 
shots. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Basketball announcers continue to give us everything but the score. That would 
be OK if the score was flashed on the screen after every basket, but it isn't. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Advice to major league managers: Don't cut down on the time you spend 
practicing rundown plays, even though spring training has been shortened. Too 
many rundowns are botched during the regular season as it is. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but I could have done without the Freeway Series. Those long, 
substitution-filled exhibition games between the Dodgers and the Angels always 
seem to be played on cold, windy nights or afternoons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers still need a center fielder, and the Philadelphia Phillies still 
need a pitcher, so why not make that Ramon Martinez-or-John Wetteland for Lenny 
Dykstra deal? . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Syracuse wide receiver Rob Moore opts for the NFL draft as expected, USC's 
job in the Kickoff game will be made easier. Moore is considered the best 
prospect at his position in the nation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How shocking that the Kings lost two in a row on the road without Wayne 
Gretzky. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Golf linguist Mark Calcavecchia, on Mark O'Meara's four-putt, quadruple-bogey 
nine on the 16th hole in the Players Championship last week: "He slummed in a 
three-footer for a four jack.". . . 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Pryor, who might have become one of the all-time great fighters if not 
for drugs, is back in the gym and looking for a bout against Hector Camacho. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
HBO will try to continue its streak of telecasting outstanding fights with 
Michael Nunn-Marlon Starling on April 17 and Pernell Whitaker-Azumah Nelson on 
May 19. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We'll know a lot more about Mister Frisky after he hooks up with another speed 
horse, Real Cash, in the Santa Anita Derby on April 7. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: The Associated Press reports that injured New York Knicks forward 
Charles Oakley will be lost to the team for six to eight weeks. Reaction: AP 
thinks the Knicks will last a lot longer in the playoffs than I do.

NHL ROUNDUP;

HULL JOINS 70-GOAL CLUB, BUT BLUES FALL TO OILERS, 8-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Hull would have enjoyed it more if his 70th goal had given the St. Louis 
Blues a victory in their bid to win the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
When he became the sixth player in NHL history to score 70 goals in a season, 
it merely kept the Blues close Wednesday night at Edmonton. The Oilers, 
battling to hold second place in the Smythe Division, prevailed, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, son of Hall of Famer Bobby Hull, joins the select group of Wayne Gretzky, 
Mario Lemieux, Phil Esposito, Jari Kurri and Bernie Nichols who have scored 70. 
</P>
<P>
Hull scored on a quick wrist shot at 17:17 of the second period to cut the 
Oiler lead to 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues lead Chicago in the tight division race by one point. The Blackhawks 
have six games to play, the Blues only four. 
</P>
<P>
Hull has broken six club records this season, including most goals and most 
points. 
</P>
<P>
He needs two goals to break Kurri's record for right wings. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri didn't have a goal, but he assisted on three for the Oilers. Mark Messier 
scored his 44th goal for the Oilers, who had 34 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 5, Calgary 4 -- The Sabres took a firm grip on second place in the 
Adams Division when Clint Malarchuk stopped 40 shots in the victory at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
With Montreal losing, the Sabres pulled three points ahead and both teams have 
just five games left. Boston leads the division by three points over the 
surging Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Priestlay scored the game-winner on a disputed goal early in the final 
period. Joe Mullen had the puck in his own end of the ice and Buffalo's Darrin 
Shannon appeared to hook him. Priestlay picked up the puck and put it in the 
net. The Flames argued heatedly that Shannon should have been penalized. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 3, Montreal 2 -- The Jets still think they have a chance to finish 
second in the Smythe Division. Pat Elynuik scored twice at Winnipeg, and the 
Jets ended the Canadiens' six-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets trail second-place Edmonton by four points. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 5, Toronto 5 -- Daniel Marois scored his 37th goal with eight 
seconds left in regulation at Toronto to get the Maple Leafs the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the two points that would have almost clinched the Patrick Division 
title, the Rangers had to be content with one. They lead New Jersey by nine 
points. Three more points will clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto is four points out of second place in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Quebec 1 -- Pat Verbeek scored two goals at Hartford, Conn., and 
the Whalers romped past the Nordiques, who have won only 12 of 74 games. 
</P>
<P>
Verbeek has 42 goals this season. DAN HAFNER

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
FRESHMAN LEADS LA QUINTA'S VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenny Granger's introduction to varsity baseball was a forgettable experience. 
The freshman left fielder struck out in his first five at-bats for La Quinta 
High School this month and admitted his self-confidence was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, Granger looked like a veteran, getting three hits and driving in 
the go-ahead run in the seventh inning of La Quinta's 3-1 victory over host 
Pacifica in the Garden Grove League opener for both schools. 
</P>
<P>
Granger had three of the four hits off Pacifica's Robert Toth, including a line 
single to right field that scored pinch-runner Scott Sommerall that broke a 1-1 
tie in the top of the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Toth (3-2) allowed only one earned run, struck out eight and didn't walk a 
hitter. He has 41 strikeouts in 29 innings and has walked only one batter. But 
he failed to retire the La Quinta freshman all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Granger hurt his knee in the very first day of practice, and then struck out 
his first five times," said Dave Demarest, La Quinta coach. "Most freshmen 
would have been in the funny farm. But he came through today." 
</P>
<P>
Demarest certainly needs the help. La Quinta (7-3) has had six players hurt at 
one time during the season. John Korzen was scheduled to start against 
Pacifica, but he hurt his knee in a doubleheader last Saturday against Newport 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"In my 17 years of coaching, I've never had so many players banged up," 
Demarest said. "Today was the first time I've had 14 players suited up." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta starter Walter Dawkins (2-1) was as impressive as Toth, striking out 
nine and walking two. Dawkins kept Pacifica (5-4) off balance with an effective 
curveball, allowing only one unearned run in the fifth when he threw a wild 
pitch that allowed Pacifica's Bob Anderson to score. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Pacifica Coach Bill Craven credited the La Quinta hitter's ability 
to make contact with two strikes in key situations as the difference in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a freshman drive in the winning run on an 0-2 count," Craven said. 
"They slap the ball around and make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 8, Rancho Alamitos 5 -- First baseman Min Son hit a bases-loaded triple 
in the sixth inning that helped Kennedy (3-5) overcome a 5-3 deficit. Brian 
Faddoul finished up for the save, but Kennedy pitchers walked 14 batters -- 
three fewer than last year's top pitcher, Pete Montera, did in 98 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos 12, Bolsa Grande 6 -- Visiting Los Amigos (1-5, 1-0) was led by 
Ethan Siddall, who had two hits including a grand slam in the first inning when 
Los Amigos (2-6, 1-0) scored eight runs on six hits. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago 11, Garden Grove 3 -- Robert Jung went two for four with four RBIs, 
Phillip Gonzales was four for four and scored two runs and Mike Kissell (3-0) 
went the distance for visiting Santiago (7-4, 1-0).

ORANGE COAST'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM OUTLASTS PIERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what amounted to a replay of last year's state junior college championship 
match, Orange Coast College defeated Pierce in five games in a tense 3 1/2-hour 
South Coast Conference match Wednesday night at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
The score was 15-12, 7-15, 15-12, 17-19, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas, who lost the state title to OCC in five games last season, were 
defeated by the Pirates for the fifth consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce (10-2 in the SCC) lost in three games at Orange Coast earlier this 
season and lost all three meetings with the Pirates last year. Orange Coast 
(11-1 in the SCC) moved into sole possession of the conference lead in the 
first match of the second round of the SCC. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce Coach Ken Stanley said before the match that it would be a war, and he 
was right. "It's sort of a pride match," Stanley said. "They annihilated us 
earlier this year. It was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth game was easily the best of the match. Pierce trailed, 14-10, and 
fought off six game points before tying the score, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas took the lead on Tony Zapata's service ace, but OCC fought off five 
game points and tied the score, 15-15, on a Pierce net violation. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates went ahead, 16-15, but Pierce tied it on Chad Blatchley's kill. 
Orange Coast went ahead, 17-16, but Pierce scored the next three points, ending 
the 48-minute game on the seventh game point when Jamal Thompson stuffed Craig 
Buccola's kill attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast jumped to a 4-2 lead in the decisive fifth game and widened its 
margin to 10-6 when Ed Gilson hit long. The Pirates outscored Pierce, 5-1, the 
rest of the way, winning the match when Matt Lyles crushed a kill off 
Thompson's attempted block. 
</P>
<P>
The first game was an exercise in sideouts. Neither team led by more than two 
points until Tyler Bates was called for a lift, giving OCC the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce controlled the second game from the outset, jumping to a 4-1 lead, then 
a 10-4 advantage, forcing two OCC timeouts. The Pirates closed to 10-7, but 
Pierce scored the final five points, winning the match when Bates set Thompson 
perfectly and the 6-4 freshman hammered the ball down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce got 41 kills from Ed Gilson.

VILLAGE CHRISTIAN, CALGARY TEAM TO PLAY 2-GAME SERIES IN FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Village Christian High has signed a contract to play football with a Canadian 
high school this year and next. The 1991 game will be played under Canadian 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian, a Southern Section Division IX school in the Alpha League, 
will play host to St. Mary's of Calgary on Sept. 15 at Kennedy High in a game 
played under U. S. rules. The Crusaders are scheduled to play at Calgary under 
Canadian rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured we had to do something innovative, since everyone else is going to 
Hawaii," Crusader Coach Mike Plaisance quipped. Another Alpha League member, 
Montclair Prep, is one of four area teams scheduled to open the '90 season in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian's contract was arranged through the Southern Section office, 
which received an inquiry from St. Mary's, a private school with an enrollment 
of 950.

STATE ATHLETES OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
Boys: 
</P>
<P>
Dan O'Neil (Mater Dei, Santa Ana). 
</P>
<P>
Came off the bench to score 19 pts to spark the Monarchs to the Div. I boys 
basketball state championship. O'Neil netted nine of his pts in the second 
quarter when Mater Dei outscored Riordan of San Francisco, 16-8. The Monarchs 
went on to a 62-60 win. Last fall, O'Neil threw for just over 2,000 yds last 
fall for the school's football team and has signed a letter of intent with 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: 
</P>
<P>
Inger Miller (Muir, Pasadena) 
</P>
<P>
Facing strong freshman Marion Jones of Rio Mesa in last week's Alemany Relays 
only brought out the best in Miller. Considered the No. 1 girls sprinter in 
track in the nation, Miller timed 11.48 seconds for 100 meters to beat Jones. 
She also anchored Muir's 00 meter relay squad to a strong early season clocking 
of 46.65. 
</P>
<P>
RATINGS NOTES 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei has been named State Team of the Year for the second time. Coach Gary 
McKnight's first No. 1 finish was in 1987 with LeRon Ellis, now of Syracuse, 
leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
In girls basketball, Placer of Auburn's 54-43 upset victory over Brea-Olinda in 
last Saturday's Div. III state finals helped Morningside wind up as State Team 
of the Year for the second consecutive season. The Monarchs, of course, helped 
their own cause by beating Berkeley impressively, 67-56. Placer's win also 
created a ratings mess. The Hillgals had to be placed ahead of Brea in Div. 
III, but they finished behind Nevada Union in their league. The problem was to 
either put Placer behind Nevada Union in the NorCal overall ratings or list 
Brea behind Washington in the SoCal poll even though Brea beat Washington 
twice. Since Placer won the biggie, we went with listing the Hillgals higher. 
</P>
<P>
Two significant spring notes to report: Troy Dunlap of Culver City became the 
sixth reported baseball player in state history to smash four home runs in one 
game when he accomplished the feat in his team's 26-1 romp last Saturday over 
Faith Baptist. Dunlap also scored six runs to tie a Southern Section record. 
Also, Brent Noon of Fallbrook broke his own state record in the shot put with a 
heave of 69-11 1/2 in a dual meet. Noon set the old mark of 69-8 1/4 last 
spring. The 6-2, 265-pounder also hurled the discus 194-7.

MCELWEE'S TRANSFER FUELS WAR OF WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The father of a high school baseball player who has transferred from L. A. 
Baptist to Granada Hills disputes the claim by L. A. Baptist Coach Joe Koh that 
the move indicates "a lack of commitment in today's world." 
</P>
<P>
Koh made his comments in the wake of the transfer of Heath McElwee, a sophomore 
infielder and pitcher who has left L. A. Baptist and enrolled at Granada Hills. 
The McElwees sold their home in Sepulveda and will move into the Granada Hills 
district in April when Heath will become eligible for the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
"Heath's been interested in attending a public school since the seventh grade," 
Dave McElwee said about his son. "We made the decision based on Granada Hills' 
reputation as a school in the community and based on Heath's friends." 
</P>
<P>
Heath McElwee, 6-foot, 160 pounds, who enrolled at Granada Hills last week, had 
six hits in eight at-bats and stole five bases in three games for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills Coach Darryl Stroh, whose son transferred from L. A. Baptist to 
Granada Hills, finds nothing unusual in the move. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids that attend (L. A. Baptist) live in our area," Stroh said. "If 
you're into athletics and the athletic program isn't quite what you think it 
should be as an athlete, then my guess is you transfer." 
</P>
<P>
McElwee was a teammate of a number of Granada Hills players in youth leagues -- 
a compelling reason for the move, Dave McElwee said. He also said that the 
family was careful to meet state rules that require a change of residence for 
student-athletes to maintain eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been taking a bold approach to keep this clean," he said. "It would have 
been unethical any other way and we don't do that stuff. We bought the house, 
it was a clean move. 
</P>
<P>
"Heath has had a very good experience at L. A. Baptist. He has great respect 
for the faculty and we think it's a great school." 
</P>
<P>
Add transfer: McElwee follows the path of a former L. A. Baptist athlete who 
transferred to Granada Hills. New Mexico quarterback Jeremy Leach led Granada 
Hills to the City Section 4-A Division title in 1987 as a senior after 
transferring from L. A. Baptist after his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist Athletic Director Maury Neville downplayed a comparison but did 
not mask his disappointment at McElwee's move. 
</P>
<P>
"We were aware that Heath was considering leaving L. A. Baptist at the end of 
last year," Neville said. "But when he re-enrolled in the fall, it was our 
understanding that he and his father were very pleased with the school. 
</P>
<P>
"From our perspective, then, it came out of the blue. I'm not pleased that we 
lost the kid." 
</P>
<P>
Upon further review: Montclair Prep running back Derek Sparks, the Times' 
Valley Back of the Year in 1989 who probably will be among the nation's top 
Division I prospects next fall, has an announcement to make. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the NFL draft," he said. "I will not forgo my senior year." 
</P>
<P>
Come again? 
</P>
<P>
Sparks claims the pronouncement is necessary to end speculation that he already 
has committed to play at USC in the fall of 1991. He said that he has received 
phone calls from colleges trying to dissuade him from a decision that he hasn't 
made. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear people say, 'You committed to SC?' " he said. "I say, 'No way.' I 
haven't signed, I haven't committed anywhere. I don't want to mess my last year 
up. Now that this has happened, I might drop USC even lower on my list." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sparks, eight schools he likes are West Virginia, Florida State, 
Georgia, Texas A&amp;M, Stanford, Washington State, USC and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is ample time to decide. In the meantime, he just wants to play 
football.

NORTHRIDGE SHUT OUT FOR 9TH TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the numbers weighed in Cal State Northridge's favor Wednesday. All but the 
final score, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Despite playing error-free softball and outhitting Minnesota, the Lady Matadors 
lost, 1-0, in Pony tournament pool play at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (14-12), which was shut out for the ninth time this season, stranded 
seven baserunners, including four at third. Jeanne Mixon collected two of 
CSUN's six hits. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Debbie Dickmann struck out 10 and walked one for Northridge, which plays 
Arizona and Toledo today. Minnesota, which improved to 8-12, had four hits. 
</P>
<P>
In another softball game: 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark 9, Pierce 0 -- Robin Thomas (11-2), a freshman right-hander from 
Newbury Park High, allowed four hits, struck out eight and walked none, leading 
the Raiders to their 43rd consecutive Western State Conference home victory. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Heggan went three for three and scored four runs for Moorpark (11-4, 4-0 
in conference play). Raider Melissa Maples had two hits as did teammate Missy 
Cress, the 1989 WSC Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin-Superior 11-3, The Master's 10-12 -- The Mustangs fell behind early 
in both games but erupted late in the second to salvage a nonconference split 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Wisconsin-Superior scored five runs in the first inning and 
one in each of the succeeding innings. The Mustangs (11-13) used five hits, 
three walks and two errors to bat around in the nine-run fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Cole, Mark MacArthur and Kevin Backes had two hits each in the nightcap, 
called after 4 1/2 innings because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman 8, Cal Lutheran 1 -- Chapman's Steve Halweg (1-0) struck out five and 
held the Kingsmen to five hits in a nonconference game at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Golden West d. Canyons 15-3, 15-8, 15-9 -- Eric Henkels, a freshman from St. 
Francis High, led the Cougars (1-13) with seven kills in a South Coast 
Conference match at Canyons.

THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL IN DENMARK;

<P>
BASEBALL: DESPITE THE SMALL-SCHOOL SETTING, THE EXPLOITS OF HARD-THROWING 
TRAVIS DENMARK OF JULIAN ARE BECOMING HARDER TO OVERLOOK.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've taken a drive up to this mountain town today, not to hike among the pine 
trees and manzanita or play tourist along Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Instead we've come to Julian High, where enrollment is around 200. Yep, an hour 
and 15 minutes from downtown San Diego, 45 minutes from the nearest divided 
highway . . . for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Coming in on Highway 78, take a right at the only stop sign in town, at Main 
Street. The diamond is about a mile down on your left. Don't let the grass-less 
"field" with a crater in center and a 15-foot embankment immediately in front 
of the outfield fence scare you. 
</P>
<P>
This small town has a big-time pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Travis Denmark. He's a Degano Indian from the Santa Ysabel 
Reservation who is said to throw an 85 m.p.h. fastball. But because Denmark 
plays in a far-off corner of the county, few have noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who have noticed say that because Denmark plays in the 1-A 
Coastal League, his statistics are inflated by weak competition. Were Denmark 
to wade into the 2-A or 3-A leagues, they say, the fire he throws would be 
doused by the bats of better players. 
</P>
<P>
But that's just theory. In reality, Denmark has been downright unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
In 19 innings, Denmark, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound senior, has struck out 42 
batters. He has allowed just one run, four walks and six hits. His record is 
3-0, his earned-run average 0.36. 
</P>
<P>
One might think such statistics would build confidence, or at least feed dreams 
of one day playing in the major leagues. But Denmark remains pessimistic about 
his chances of continuing past the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what's going to happen after June," Denmark said. "I'd like to go 
on and play baseball somehow without going to college." 
</P>
<P>
Denmark has reason to doubt the possibilities of doing just that. Two years 
ago, when Julian won the San Diego Section 1-A championship, shortstop Kenny 
Teter put up some respectable numbers of his own; he finished the year with a 
.540 batting average. But he got little attention, and it remained so it came 
time to hand out scholarships and make draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard to get noticed (in the 1-A Southern Conference)," said 
Teter, who now works in construction. "It's so small, nobody really looks at 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Scouts did watch Teter play a couple times, but he was facing 60-m.p.h. 
pitching, and, well, the scouts figured anyone could bat .540 against that kind 
of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Teter spends his afternoons shagging fly balls with the current Julian 
High players, helping coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Carl Focarelli fears the same fate for Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story," Focarelli said. "Up here in Julian, it's real, real 
difficult to get anybody to drive up and look at players. I read the papers, 
and all I hear about is the 2-A and 3-A kids. I read about some kid who has 20 
strikeouts in 14 innings, and they're making a big deal about him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to get my point across and get scouts up here to look at 
Travis." 
</P>
<P>
So the only baseball people talking about Denmark are opposing coaches and 
umpires. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Greg Yeaw of Borrego Springs has seen enough of Denmark to put his name 
down on a prospects form sent out by the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big, hard-throwing kid, and I think he should be looked at by the 
Padres," Yeaw said. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Denmark pitched against Borrego Springs, he struck out 13 in a 
4-0 victory. Saul Nass umpired that one and left in awe. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching that kid pitch made the two-hour trip worthwhile," Nass said. "I 
haven't seen a high school pitcher of his level, and I've been umpiring here 
for over two years (Nass previously umpired college games in Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"He just had real good command of his pitches. He had a good fastball, a 
curveball that broke a couple feet and a knuckleball that danced all over the 
place. The catcher could not catch that pitch. The hitters were all fooled by 
it. If they swung at it, they missed it by a couple feet. If they didn't swing, 
half the time it was over for a strike." 
</P>
<P>
Denmark, who doesn't tout his talents with much relish, does enjoy talking 
about his knuckleball. 
</P>
<P>
"It moves a whole lot," he said. "And I usually don't throw it for a strike, 
but everybody swings at it." 
</P>
<P>
Focarelli elaborated. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws it with speed, which is really baffling to hitters," he said. "He 
throws it without the seams moving at all, and when you get a guy who throws an 
85 m.p.h. fastball who can also throw a knuckleball like that, it's 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
It's also somewhat unique in high school baseball. Very few pitchers even on 
the pro level can throw a knuckleball effectively; almost no high school 
pitchers can. Those that do save the pitch for a changeup when they're ahead in 
the count. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a few of them around this year," said Dennis Pugh, coach at Mission 
Bay High, who has had several pitchers move on to college and minor league 
ball. "But you just don't see many around who can get it over for strikes. If 
you can get it over for strikes, it's basically impossible to hit at this 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Pugh, while saying he wouldn't want to see Denmark pitch against his team, also 
voiced what seems to be a universal concern about him. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is he's doing it at the 1-A level," Pugh said. "Would he be 
successful at a higher level?" 
</P>
<P>
While Denmark has had to fight the small-school label, playing in the back 
country has brought one benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig, guru of the split-finger fastball and currently manager of the San 
Francisco Giants, moved to nearby Ranchita a year and a half ago. Denmark's 
father, Dan, poured cement for Craig's new home. 
</P>
<P>
When the job was done, Dan Denmark asked Craig if he might give Travis a few 
pointers. 
</P>
<P>
So before the high school season started last year, Travis went to Ranchita and 
threw in front of a major league manager. Craig helped Denmark with his 
delivery, showing him how to pitch with his entire body, not just his right 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
Craig also added another pitch to Denmark's repertoire -- the split-finger 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Craig didn't throw any compliments Denmark's way ("My arm was real bad then," 
Denmark said), but he did tell the pitcher to keep in touch and send a copy of 
his statistics after last season. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Denmark never got around to it, even though the numbers were impressive 
enough to make Denmark the only non-senior on the 1-A all-section team -- and 
the only unanimous pick. He struck out 112 batters in 63 innings and compiled a 
2.57 ERA and a 7-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
His record, according to Focarelli, is somewhat misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have easily been 12-0," Focarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Denmark's losses were by one run. One was a 13-inning, 2-1 loss to 
Francis Parker, the eventual 1-A section champion. Denmark pitched all 13 
innings and allowed just two hits, the first in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
For nine innings thereafter, Denmark pitched no-hit ball, with 13 strikeouts. 
But after giving up a second base hit in the 13th, a walk and an error allowed 
the winning run to score, and Denmark had only a loss to show for his effort. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Focarelli, Denmark doesn't put the asterisk on last year's record. In 
fact, he remains rather silent about his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"He rarely changes his expression," Focarelli said. "You can't tell if he has 
just hit a home run or if he has just struck out. He just remains on an even 
keel." 
</P>
<P>
He's the same way at home, according to his mother, Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a really quiet boy," she said. "He never gives us any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Focarelli uses the word "shy," and tells of a time Denmark asked not to pitch 
in a game because he knew the competition was weak and would only serve to pad 
his statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his introverted demeanor explains why Denmark never got back to Roger 
Craig. 
</P>
<P>
"He just doesn't brag about his talents," Focarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
He also possesses them at the plate. Denmark is 11 for 14 (.786) with two home 
runs, three doubles and nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
But what is Denmark to do next? 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants me to go to college, but I never really thought of it," 
Denmark said. "I'm kind of tired of school right now." 
</P>
<P>
Denmark says he's doing just enough to keep his grade-point average at 2.0. His 
father says Travis has been getting some mail from colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had the feelers," Dan said. "Pepperdine and San Diego State seem 
interested, but Travis hasn't expressed any interest. I'm sure he could get a 
full scholarship somewhere, but that's not what he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
So Denmark will continue hoping to attract the attention of a major league 
scout, something that might not be out of the question. If he continues at his 
current pace, he would strike out 227 and obliterate the section season record 
of 170 set by Ron Scayliotti of Monte Vista in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"If he keeps on doing it all year, someone will notice him," said Mission Bay's 
Dennis Pugh. "Like I say, it's not what you do in March, it's what you do in 
May."

POWAY BRINGS WEALCH BACK FOR BASKETBALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Wealch's coaching career has come full circle. On Wednesday, he was named 
the Poway High School boys' basketball coach -- again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little strange, a little different, the second time around," said 
Wealch, 41. "I feel like Gene Bartow coming in after John Wooden." 
</P>
<P>
Neville Saner, the school's winningest coach, resigned on March 1. Saner had 
succeeded Wealch, who resigned 13 games into his second season with the Titans, 
in January 1983. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Wealch cited "irreconcilable differences between me and the 
administration" as the reason for his leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new opportunity and a new time, and we're going to go forward from 
there," Wealch explained. "I have nothing bad to say about what happened 
before. This is a completely new situation, and you can't compare the two 
periods in time." 
</P>
<P>
Wealch has spent the past six years assisting just-retired Andy Gilmour at 
Palomar College. The Poway job was contingent upon his not pursuing the 
community college position. 
</P>
<P>
At Poway, Wealch was 11-11 his first year and 5-8 when he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Before Poway, Wealch assisted at Mt. Carmel for two years. He spent the 
previous seven years at his alma mater, San Bernardino's Pacific High School, 
including two as head coach. He was named league coach of the year after his 
first season, in which he finished 14-10 with a team that had won only three 
games the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a rebuilding kind of guy," Wealch said. "Now I have an 
opportunity to take a little different phase of the game and see what I can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans will lose only two seniors from this year's 18-7 team. MARTIN 
HENDERSON

FINALLY, A FIGHT ON THE WATER; 
</P>
<P>
DANISH/AMERICAN CHALLENGE: INSTEAD OF SITTING IN A COURTROOM, SAILORS WITH 
AMERICA'S CUP ASPIRATIONS WILL BE DOING SOMETHING UNUSUAL THIS WEEKEND -- 
SAILING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was something oddly refreshing about Danish skipper Valdemar Bandolowski 
discussing race strategy for this weekend's initial Danish/American Cup 
Challenge in San Diego Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
It was seemingly the first time in nearly two years that courtroom strategy was 
not a prevailing topic for skippers who hope to compete in the next America's 
Cup competition in spring of 1992. Discussion focused on the eight-race regatta 
scheduled for Friday through Sunday, not litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Like baseball, the sport of yachting could use some actual competition to 
rebuild its tattered image. 
</P>
<P>
Bandolowski said he will be trying to build Denmark's yachting image -- the 
Danes are making their first venture into the America's Cup fray -- and beat 
his old friend and foe, American skipper Peter Isler. 
</P>
<P>
But Bandolowski also said he and Isler have a chance to show the yachting world 
what competition means. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the same type of problem with us and the United States that New 
Zealand had," Bandolowski said. "It's good to be fighting with good friends on 
the water. Yachting has to be something you do for fun, not for economic 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter is a very intelligent man and an excellent yachtsman. We'll both be 
fighting hard and using the rules. It should be a great race." 
</P>
<P>
Isler, ranked No. 1 in the United States in match racing and No. 4 in the 
world, said he's happy that racing is finally back in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's high time we took the focus out of the courtroom and (put it) back out on 
the water," he said. "I consider this to be the first event leading up to the 
America's Cup." 
</P>
<P>
That is why Bandolowski considers his eight match races against Isler so 
meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's very important to see how far we have come, what areas we've 
improved on and what areas we need to improve on," Bandolowski said. "The 
America's Cup is only two years away (pending a court decision) and we have to 
start getting an idea about our chances." 
</P>
<P>
Bandolowski and Isler and their 11-man crews will rotate between the Swiftsure 
III and the Hokulele for the eight races. Both are 68-foot custom 
Nelson/Marek-designed "maxi-sleds," only six feet shorter than the new 
74-footers being designed for the next America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Each day's racing will begin at 12:30 p.m., and the courses will be short with 
multiple laps. Three races will be held Friday and Saturday and two Sunday. 
Winners will collect escalating point values each day. 
</P>
<P>
The boats will never be more than a mile from shore on the north end of the 
harbor by Harbor and Shelter islands and should also be visible from Seaport 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
Bandolowski said the proximity to spectators can only help to promote yachting. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of race is very exciting because of the fact that everybody can see 
it," Bandolowski said. "For yachtsmen, we have a very exciting sport, but you 
have to understand the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways of explaining our sport is through a regatta like this, where 
people can see everything that is going on." 
</P>
<P>
And Bandolowski said he expects a lot of action. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be a lot of tacking (sailing at a 90-degree angle from the wind) 
and jibing (steering away from the wind)," he said. "There's no margin for 
error on this short of a course. Crew work will be very essential, and it will 
also be important to get a good start." 
</P>
<P>
If Olympic gold medals mean anything, Bandolowski has the edge on Isler -- two 
to zero. 
</P>
<P>
He captured the gold in 1976 and 1980 in the three-man soling class. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of respect for Valdemar -- the two gold medals are enough for 
me," Isler said. 
</P>
<P>
But there's more to Bandolow ski's resume. He won the Half-Ton Cup in 1972, the 
soling world championship in 1984 and the Dragon Gold Cup in '84 and '86. 
</P>
<P>
But Bandolowski, 44, said cups and gold medals pale in comparison to the 
America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the culmination of every thing you've learned," he said. "That's where 
you get to work on the boat, with the crew and have some very intense 
one-on-one racing. That's something you can't do in other aspects of racing 
because you don't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
After years of having the tradition, experience and talent but not the money, 
Bandolowski said Denmark's corporations have finally opened their wallets. 
</P>
<P>
More than 35 corporations have contributed to the America's Cup cause, 
including two of Denmark's biggest, Tuborg-Carlsberg Brewery and the Board of 
Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, the America's Cup was one or two wealthy people racing each other, but 
now, with corporate sponsorship getting involved, it's become a lot easier to 
get involved," Bandolowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The Denmark America's Cup Committee is building two boats, the first of which 
will be ready in August, and they are employing 20 people full-time. Next to 
soccer and handball, Bandolowski said, sailing is Denmark's most popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always had a fine tradition for sailing in Denmark, with the Olympics 
and all the world titles, and the conditions here are great for sailing," 
Bandolowski said. "We have learned a lot over the years and we have some 
excellent designers here. So why shouldn't we be able to win the America's 
Cup?"

Distributed Logic Corp.: The Anaheim-based computer products company reported a 
loss of $1.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1990, contrasted with a 
loss of $376,933 for the comparable period last year. Revenue for the three 
months ended Jan. 31 declined 15% to $10.3 million from $12.1 million. The 
company said the loss resulted from a combination of factors, including lower 
revenues from U.S. operations, delays in deliveries to a major customer and 
costs related to a recent staff reduction.

ARCHITECTURE: TROLLEY HELPS TO PUT DESIGN ON RIGHT TRACK DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the city's downtown grows up, new combinations of uses are giving architects 
fresh design challenges. The results are some of the most interesting buildings 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
Take transportation systems, for example. Developers now realize that by 
integrating their projects with bus and trolley lines, they can make city 
planners happy while delivering office workers and retail consumers to their 
doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
As the San Diego Trolley expands downtown, architects are getting a chance to 
do lively projects along its tracks. Chicago architect Helmut Jahn's new 
headquarters for Great American Bank, now being built on Broadway, will 
straddle the trolley line. The movement of trolley cars and people through 
these spaces should give the project the same kind of energy Jahn captured in 
his widely publicized Chicago terminal for United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Across downtown, at 12th and Imperial avenues, the James R. Mills Building -- a 
mixed-use project incorporating a trolley station, government offices and 
ground-level shops -- shows how exciting the confluence of people, cars and 
trolleys can be. 
</P>
<P>
The building, which opened early last year, has received several awards for its 
design. Last June, the local American Institute of Architects chapter selected 
it to receive an Honor Award, its highest recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being just another government office complex, the building is a 
people machine. Walking toward it from any direction, you find yourself drawn 
by its graceful 220-foot-high clock tower ground-level activity. 
</P>
<P>
Trolleys roll through, stopping to pick up passengers. People come and go. Some 
leave their cars in the parking structure and take the trolley into downtown. 
Others observe and are observed as they sit outdoors at a large circular plaza 
in front, at tables outside a deli and at a smaller outdoor area behind the 
main building. This last area will serve the trolley's bayside line, scheduled 
to open this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the station's convenience mart-snack shop, people relax with a 
newspaper, a deli sandwich or a soft drink from stools behind large panes of 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Such vibrant urban transportation hubs are common in the east, but are all too 
rare in California. 
</P>
<P>
Deceptively simple in appearance, the complex marks a sophisticated departure 
from what's been done downtown. The building's strong, clean exterior 
geometries grew from its structural system, instead of being lifted from this 
year's trendy design book or designed as an imitation of history. 
</P>
<P>
Starboard Development was hired by the Metropolitan Transit Development Board 
to build the project on time and on budget. As part of its team, Starboard 
brought in the San Diego architectural firm of Delawie Bretton Wilkes 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a client can make. The architects had also collaborated with 
Starboard on the city of San Diego's downtown police station, completed in 
1985, but with a much less impressive result. Michael Wilkes, a partner in the 
firm, defended the police station as a decent building on a limited budget. 
After additional prodding, though, he indirectly acknowledged the transit 
building's more sophisticated design. 
</P>
<P>
"Why the chemistry was better, I can't tell you," he said. One reason, perhaps, 
is that transit officials seemed to have an intuitive sense of what makes good 
architecture. MTDB General Manager Tom Larwin insisted that his company's new 
office building incorporate the trolley station, instead of making it separate. 
</P>
<P>
The architects' initial design shows where the project might have gone without 
input from Larwin and others, such as City Architect Mike Stepner, Centre City 
Development Corp. urban design expert Max Schmidt and San Diego city planners 
Paul Curcio and Marianne Munsell. 
</P>
<P>
A downtown train station designed early this century by San Diego architect 
Irving Gill served as a stylistic point of departure (it was torn down a few 
years later when the tracks were moved). 
</P>
<P>
The early version of the MTDB complex was a weird combination of free-standing 
walls resembling mission ruins, in front of a low glass box. The trolley tracks 
passed behind the building. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed by Larwin &amp; Co. to provide a new building incorporating additional 
office space that could be leased to other users, the architects designed a 
clean-lined building with trolley trains running through its base and a clock 
tower as a focal point. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, MTDB decided to maximize development of its site. Starboard signed 
up the county of San Diego to take 75% of the space, and MTDB asked for a 
10-story building with a six-story parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the architects pulled the clock tower away as a separate feature. 
It serves as the project's visual anchor, while giving downtown San Diego a 
significant landmark in an area mostly occupied by run-down industrial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of completely covering the building's steel frame, the architects made 
it a key feature. Painted red to pick up the color of the trolleys, the steel 
members form striking giant X's at the building's base. A single size of 
window, repeated many times, cut costs and generated eye-catching visual 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Between windows, the building is covered with a light, Styrofoam-like material 
called Sto. It had never been used in San Diego, according to the architects, 
and it gives the building a rich, solid appearance. 
</P>
<P>
City planner Munsell gets credit for suggesting landscaping the top of the 
parking structure. Planters atop tall pillars contain creeping vines that will 
eventually spread along the structure's perimeter, following a network of 
wires. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its many successes, the Mills building has shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the clock tower should be more than a giant piece of art. At 
30-by-30-feet square, couldn't it have housed some uses? MTDB General Counsel 
Jack Limber, who departed from his usual legal and management duties to oversee 
this project, said the construction budget didn't allow anything inside the 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
But a 30-by-30 space could have become a 900-square-foot artist's loft on each 
of several floors. It would have been interesting to see proposals for 
developing the tower's interior. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a useful purpose within, the tower needs something to animate its 
base. A ground-floor snack shop, sandwich counter, news stand or some other use 
would give people a reason to use the adjacent plaza more often. It's not too 
late to consider this. 
</P>
<P>
A final drawback is the shady central plaza, where the sun's rays are blocked 
by the office building most of the day. That's not a problem during the warmer 
months, but, on a breezy March morning, the plaza was deserted. People 
clustered in one splotch of sunlight at its outer edge. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: Michael Graves, designer of the Aventine, the new La Jolla 
office-hotel complex that is not well-liked by many San Diego architects, gets 
heavy coverage in the March issue of Progressive Architecture. If San Diegans 
think the Aventine is wild, they should see Graves' cartoonish Florida hotels 
for Disney, topped with giant swans.

JACK SMITH: THE GLOBAL SEARCH FOR A THEATER IN BALBOA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our group was going on Saturday evening to see Neil Simon's new play, "Jake's 
Women," at the Old Globe Theater in Balboa Park. We were to dine in a 
restaurant near the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Park is about as big as Connecticut, and poorly signed. We drove around 
curving streets through miles of grassy knolls and saw no sign of the theater. 
First we stopped and asked a young couple sitting in a parked car. They were 
eating. They said they were lost, and thought they might as well eat; keep 
their strength up. 
</P>
<P>
Next we stopped a man walking. He turned out to be an Australian who had no 
idea where he was. Then we stopped a young woman walking with a little girl. 
She said she was not lost, but she didn't know where she was in relation to the 
Old Globe. 
</P>
<P>
We found it finally by sheer perseverance, or else luck. 
</P>
<P>
Times critic Sylvie Drake has already dealt astutely with "Jake's Women" in her 
review. All I will add is that I usually enjoy dramas in which the main male is 
more of a cad than I am; it makes me feel more decent by comparison. I really 
believe that I am a nicer man than Jake, less self-absorbed and less 
egotistical. So, whatever its shortcomings may be, the play left me feeling 
better about myself. I really couldn't see why Jake's six women clung to him. 
The jerk. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a pleasant experience. We could hear every word in the little 
theater, and Steve Baer, our driver, was superb in finding his way back to the 
hotel. We capped the evening with a little party. 
</P>
<P>
Since the hotel's grill was closed, my wife and I set out on foot the next 
morning to find a place for breakfast. There was a light rain. We walked down E 
Street to 4th Street and turned toward Broadway. San Diego has a homeless 
problem. We were beset by several panhandlers. Many wore knit caps and carried 
canvas bags or bedrolls. A few were women. One man sitting against a building 
asked me mechanically for a nickel and said, "Thank you" when I failed to 
oblige. I felt cheap. Another man, sitting on a bench in Horton Park beside a 
woman, said wryly, "Could you spare $100?" I complimented him on aiming high, 
but I didn't have $100 and I felt that giving him a lesser amount would be 
demeaning. 
</P>
<P>
We finally ate in a Carl's Jr. I have had good food in Carl's Jr., but our 
breakfast of scrambled eggs and bacon was not one of the memorable breakfasts 
of my life. Street people kept walking through the restaurant and congregating 
at the exits. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward we explored the new Horton Park Plaza, an opulent shopping center. We 
wandered into an art gallery and were approached by no fewer than three 
salespersons (one being a woman) who must have zeroed in on us because of my 
wife's elegant seaweed green ultra-suede suit. They probably thought we were 
rich. (My wife ordered the suit aboard the QE2 from a Hong Kong tailor.) We 
looked at two LeRoy Niemans, one priced at $75,000, the other at $100,000. A 
salesman assured us that Nieman was really peaking, and that the prices could 
only go up. Remembering the hideous rugs we had bought in Morocco for $1,300, I 
decided against making an investment. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Professional Women champagne brunch in the Picasso Room at the 
hotel was better than breakfast. Having had my quota of eggs already, I had 
mostly champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Then we walked to the Civic Theater, past the beautifully restored U.S. Grant 
Hotel, to see Donizetti's "Daughter of the Regiment." 
</P>
<P>
The plot is rather thin. Marie was adopted by this French regiment as an 
infant. She loves them all and they love her. She believes that war is the 
highest moral good. 
</P>
<P>
Then she falls for a civilian. But it turns out she is the daughter of the 
local marquis, who snatches her away and arranges for her to marry a rich 
German princeling. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her civilian joins the regiment. I don't want to give it away, but 
it ends quite happily; the soprano does not jump off a parapet onto a 
trampoline. The music is light and melodic, and there is a lot of coloratura. 
</P>
<P>
Driving home, I felt culturally uplifted.

YOUR WHEELS: SHOULD YOU BUY A CAR OR LEASE IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buying a new car is one of the largest financial transactions most consumers 
enter into, exceeded only by the purchase of a home. Traditionally, new cars 
have been purchased with cash or by a loan. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1980s saw a rise in auto leasing, and it is predicted that by 1995 as 
many as half of all new cars will be acquired under some kind of a lease 
agreement. While leases are not difficult to understand by themselves, the 
choice between a lease and a loan can be quite complex. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, a loan has a lower overall cost to the consumer over a period of 
three to four years, compared to a lease of the same duration. The lowest-cost 
approach to owning a car definitely is to hold it more than four years and 
virtually drive it into the ground. By the time a car has more than 100,000 
miles on the odometer, it is considered fully depreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Most motorists don't like this approach, though, preferring to trade in a car 
before its value has declined to $1,000 or less. So, the average period of 
ownership for a new car is considerably short of 100,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers trying to decide between a lease or a loan have not had an abundance 
of information to help make their selection, but a small and easy-to-understand 
book has recently been published that helps sort out the issues. "Lease Your 
Car for Less," by Richard L. Kaye, takes a consumer through the leasing jungle 
and offers an easy work sheet for comparing leasing and loan costs. It is 
available at most bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
Since, over its lifetime, a lease generally costs more than a loan, what 
advantages does it offer? Under a lease, a motorist does not put up a large 
initial down payment, monthly payments are typically lower, and there is no 
risk that a car will depreciate in value unexpectedly because of defects 
revealed by the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
These factors mean that for the same monthly payments and cash outlay, a 
motorist can afford a larger or more luxurious car. Leasing allows a trade up 
in status or at least the public image of that status, a strong motivation in 
our consumer culture and one that seems to grow more powerful every year. 
</P>
<P>
There are four important elements that determine the cost of a lease: the 
vehicle purchase price, the estimated residual value at the end of the lease, 
the lease rate or fee, and extraordinary fees, taxes and service charges. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye's first bit of advice, if you intend to lease, is to negotiate for the 
lowest possible purchase price, the way you would if you planned on getting a 
bank loan. The important point is not to tell the dealer that you intend to 
lease until after you have agreed on a price. (This may be a bit difficult in 
practice, since dealerships almost always insist on knowing how a car is to be 
financed before a final agreement on price.) 
</P>
<P>
Next, you will need to examine the lease rate, whether it is computed by the 
cap-cost method or the constant-yield method. The leasing company often will 
not disclose the rate, but in his book, Kaye has an easy formula for computing 
that rate. 
</P>
<P>
The residual value is just as important as the purchase price of the vehicle, 
and leasing companies differ in these terms. And extraordinary fees can be 
treacherous, since they include charges for excess mileage at the end of the 
lease and penalties for poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
One important piece of advice is to limit the lease to the duration of the 
original warranty on the car, which should also protect you from unexpected 
repairs. And if the car turns out to be a well-known lemon and depreciates in 
value unexpectedly, you can walk away unscathed.

CONSUMER VIEWS: SEVERAL WAYS TO ELIMINATE TERMITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: As a subscriber, an urban entomologist and a technical service and 
development specialist for Dow Elanco &amp; Co., I would like to provide you 
with additional information relative to your article of Feb. 7, 1990, "Tallying 
the Benefits of a Cool, New Method of Termite Extermination" (using liquid 
nitrogen). As you stated, fumigation has been the primary method of eliminating 
dry-wood termites from structures. What you failed to tell your concerned 
readers is that it remains the only proven method of eliminating dry-wood 
termites from structures. 
</P>
<P>
The Blizzard System requires the extent of the infestation to be determined 
before treatment. The problem with attempting to control dry-wood termites with 
local treatments such as Blizzard is that most colonies are very difficult to 
find. Fiber-optics will not reveal most colonies . . . because dry-wood 
termites leave the outer layer of wood beams untouched as a protective shield. 
I am sure that most homeowners are not informed of this drawback. 
</P>
<P>
A bill is being introduced in the coming session of the California Legislature 
which will require evidence to support the claims of persons proposing the use 
of non-pesticidal insect-control methods. Without the field testing, which Jim 
Wells of the California Department of Food and Agriculture said was not 
conducted, how can one know whether the Blizzard System actually is effective? 
</P>
<P>
The Blizzard System probably will kill dry-wood termites in exposed locations 
when colonies can be located. In such cases, spot injections of very small 
quantities of an aerosol insecticide into the termite galleries would also kill 
the colonies, and at about 25% of the cost of the Blizzard System. 
</P>
<P>
Often, one method of handling complaints (of dissatisfied customers) is 
fumigation, since fumigation eliminates all the termites in the structure, not 
just those that can be found by the termite inspector. It is our right to 
choose, but it is also our right and obligation to be well informed when making 
our choice. -- BRIAN M. SCHNEIDER 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Since Tallon Termite &amp; Pest Control's use of liquid nitrogen to 
exterminate termites is relatively new (1985), and is a patented technique to 
boot, I didn't think for a minute that the previous column describing it would 
slip by without rebuttal. I am in the middle, just as much as the lowly termite 
is. We took the points you made to Joe Tallon Sr., the firm's president, 
because you obviously have broad expertise in the field. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure you aren't surprised that Tallon found little merit in your arguments. 
He concedes that the extent of infestation does, indeed, have to be determined 
before treatment with liquid nitrogen. But he takes exception to the statement 
that "fiber-optics will not reveal most colonies there (in wall voids or floor 
beams) because dry-wood termites leave the outer layer of wood beams untouched 
as a protective shield." 
</P>
<P>
Tallon points out that fiber-optics are used extensively in such diverse 
professions as the medical field and in the inspection of aircraft engines and 
are quite successful. He also adds that while termites do "leave the outer 
layer of wood beams untouched," this misses the point of the fiber-optics 
inspection -- which is to pick up "the termite pellets that they kick out in 
order to clean their channels." 
</P>
<P>
And, Tallon continues, while the California Department of Food and Agriculture 
may not have conducted field tests of the Blizzard System, his company 
conducted field tests "extensively before we applied for and got EPA 
(Environmental Protection Agency) approval. In all, we've probably done 2,000 
to 3,000 field tests." 
</P>
<P>
And he agrees with you completely that termites in exposed locations can, 
indeed, be killed with small quantities of aerosol insecticide at about 25% of 
the Blizzard cost. "Sure," Tallon agrees, "if you can see them you can kill 
them -- with insecticide, WD 40, aerosol hair spray or with a hammer, for that 
matter. They aren't the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Tallon dispute a Wall Street Journal story about a dissatisfied 
Blizzard System customer. 
</P>
<P>
"In about 15% of the cases it doesn't work, and so we go back and do it 
conventionally, with tenting. What the fumigation people don't tell you is that 
they have their misses, too. If the temperature drops or stays cold after 
tenting they've got a strong chance of not getting a kill, either."

RALLYE HO! PUZZLED DRIVERS HIT THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, Foster is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They can be more agonizing than asking for directions at a gas station, and 
even more horrible than discovering page 14 is missing from the Thomas Guide 
street directory. 
</P>
<P>
Car rallyes, born on West Coast college campuses in the late 1950s, are not for 
the weak-wheeled. 
</P>
<P>
Commonly called "brain teasers on wheels," the rallyes (no one seems to know 
how the name became misspelled or exactly who originated the sport) challenge 
drivers to untangle double entendres and other language traps as they chart, 
for instance, a 20-mile course through residential streets in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The sport, which nearly became extinct in the mid-70s during the gas crisis, 
gradually regained popularity at a Sepulveda Dam site in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Now about 200 participants gather there one Saturday night each month to scour 
rules for hidden meanings before starting up engines. Participants pay $10 a 
car to enter, and can take up to four hours to complete the course, which is 
not run as a race. To avoid traffic jams, starting times are staggered, 
beginning at 7:30 p.m. Points are racked up by correctly answering questions on 
a control card. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exercise in mental misdirection," said Eugene Volokh, 21, a 
rallyemaster who has written several rallyes. "We try to convince you that 
things are different from what they seem. It makes you think in precise terms." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Volokh once told drivers, who were purchasing rallye novelties 
during registration, that "nothing will go on sale" after the start. The first 
instruction on the evening's rule sheet was to "turn right as soon as 
possible," which would have steered drivers onto Sale Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Rule sheets are rife with so many word traps that they force drivers to 
scrutinize directions much like lawyers dissect legal documents. Rallyemasters 
often pack as many as six traps into one rule which, in turn, can produce as 
many as 17 answers, sending cars in a hodgepodge of directions. 
</P>
<P>
But entrants seldom get lost. Each potential misdirection has a built-in 
"loop," sending drivers back on course. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people are satisfied when they catch one trap, so they won't look 
for a more complex, hidden one," said Larry Scholnick, a 20-year rallye veteran 
who lives in Sherman Oaks. "We try to trick them into believing a more 
difficult trap doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something that only geniuses would do," said Volokh, who graduated 
from UCLA with a degree in math and computer science at 15. "It's for everyone. 
It requires a love of puzzles, but it's not a contest between great minds." 
</P>
<P>
But the 12 or so rallyemasters (there isn't an official count or organized 
group) who write the rules do appear to possess microchip minds. Volokh lives 
in the Hollywood Hills, where he writes software programs. Scholnick, 37, works 
as a systems analyst in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
To aspire to the rank of master, entrants must pass through five categories of 
difficulties, "trophying," or winning, two to four times in each category 
before eventually graduating to the title of rallyemaster. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent rallye, about 175 entrants queued up to register and receive 
instructions at the Sepulveda Dam parking lot. Nearly 100 cars and vans were 
parked, many containing teen-agers, families and couples hunched over rules 
with flashlights, searching for traps. Nearby, about 30 first-timers, who 
entered the beginner's course, pulled wool jackets and ski parkas tighter as 
Bill Armstrong, a rallye assistant, explained the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I see some quizzical looks out there. Are you still with me?" the Pasadena 
rallye veteran asked. 
</P>
<P>
Other participants huddled around a blue Honda Accord, its hood laden with 
boxes of trophies destined for winners from the previous month's rallye. 
</P>
<P>
Along the course, car map lights flicked on as navigators and back-seat drivers 
pored over directives, shouting first "Turn right!" then "Turn left!" and 
finally, "Back up!" 
</P>
<P>
Others got out of cars, either to escape arguments that fogged up windshields 
or to get a better look at street signs. Some complained that spending money to 
get lost in Reseda after enduring rush-hour traffic was not their idea of a fun 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really interesting," said Allison Gates, a first-time participant who 
lives in Pacoima. "No matter how well you have it figured out, you suspect you 
have to think it through a little further." 
</P>
<P>
Gates, 35, who was traveling with a friend, added: "We definitely are having 
some differences of opinion in the car. I wanted to stop at each intersection 
along a certain stretch to check them against the rules, but my friend said, 
'There's no way I'm going to stop the car and do that!' 
</P>
<P>
"We're still friends now, but I can see where some people wouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
Drivers entered two checkpoints set up along the route where more rules were 
handed out. Traps were uncovered, which had little to do with driving or the 
route itself. "Because of inclement weather, if it begins to pour, please turn 
on your windshield wipers," one rule stated. Rallye workers served hot 
chocolate at the checkpoint as some drivers remembered to turn on their wipers 
as the steaming liquid was poured, while others were distracted by the welcome 
sight of something hot to drink on a chilly night. 
</P>
<P>
Traps can become doubly difficult as participants sort out an order of 
precedence within the instructions: Directives from the rallyemaster must be 
heeded over rules received at checkpoints. Other rules and instructions are 
even further down. If items conflict, entrants must obey the higher precedence. 
The final tallies are judged by the course rallyemaster. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers and navigators gathered at a Granada Hills Round Table Pizza after the 
rallye to socialize and compare control cards. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a high and a sense of satisfaction, figuring out when someone is trying 
to fool me," said James Watkins, 46, who lives in Sylmar and works as a 
television repairman. 
</P>
<P>
"I would absolutely do it again," said Watkins' navigator, psychotherapist 
Susan Adler, 49, of Tarzana. "I do crossword puzzles every day. I like the fact 
that you always have to be thinking." 
</P>
<P>
When designing a course, rallyemasters first consult the Thomas Guide to search 
for neighborhoods. Streets often are chosen for names that conveniently mesh 
with a theme. But almost any location will do. 
</P>
<P>
One rallye centered around a "Moonlighting" TV series theme. Drivers were told 
that each time they saw Willis, they should consider it Addison (Bruce Willis 
starred in the series as David Addison). Upon arriving at the intersection of 
Willis Avenue and Addison Street in Van Nuys, drivers were asked to name the 
junction which had become Addison/Addison and could no longer be considered an 
intersection. A previous rule had stated that intersections must consist of two 
differently named streets. 
</P>
<P>
Rallyemasters spend up to 300 hours creating rallyes, a process that includes a 
dry run of the course and a double-check of complicated loop systems by other 
rallyemasters. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly events turn only a slim profit, said Scholnick, adding that 
overhead costs like trophies, classified advertisements and a 4,000-member 
mailing list pare down earnings. Charities, such as Childrens Hospital in Los 
Angeles, sometimes benefit from the rallyes. 
</P>
<P>
What do neighbors think of a fleet of cars descending on their quiet, suburban 
neighborhoods? 
</P>
<P>
"We did have an incident a couple years ago where cars had to turn around in a 
dead end," said Scholnick, who added police are tolerant of the rallyes that 
instruct drivers to always obey the vehicle code. "One woman got real upset 
about all the traffic so she put up a fake checkpoint sign. She went up to the 
car windows and asked for passengers' rallye instructions. And then she 
crumpled them up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bullwinkle Says, 'Turn Left at Oxnard' 
</P>
<P>
An excerpt from a recent car rallye with a "Bullwinkle" theme: 
</P>
<P>
Left at OXNARD and then left at LASAINE. 
</P>
<P>
What is the name of the Xth RDWY you come to on your right? To determine X, use 
the following: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- = X + Y - Z. 
</P>
<P>
X = the zip code for Frostbite Falls, Minn., minus the phone extension of the 
Whatsa Matta U football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Y = X minus 1. 
</P>
<P>
Z = 2 times Y. 
</P>
<P>
While you are puzzling over Q3, the narrator says: A gust of wind blows the 
Kurward Derby into your car and onto Bullwinkle's head. The Derby turns the 
wearer into the smartest person in the world. Bullwinkle correctly tells you, 
"The capital city of Bulgaria is named Sophia; 56789 is the zip code for 
Frostbite Falls, Minn.; the speed of light is 299,792 km/sec, and the Whatsa 
Matta U football coach's extension is 56787." Unfortunately for you, another 
gust of wind blows the Derby away, and Bullwinkle reverts to his normal, not 
too intelligent self.

TODAY'S SCHOOL NURSE IS NO 'BAND-AID QUEEN'; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A PILOT PROGRAM SENDS THEM TO EIGHT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS EACH WEEK TO 
SCREEN FOR EVERYTHING FROM MALNOURISHMENT TO WAR-RELATED STRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Virginia Hayes sits in a sparsely decorated office, applying equal amounts of 
Band-Aids and TLC to the knee-scraped children who come through her door. On a 
busy day, one or two feverish children may rest on a cot until their parents 
arrive to take them home. 
</P>
<P>
A typical picture of today's school nurse? Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"People have the stereotyped image about school nurses being like a Band-Aid 
queen. But when you're dealing with a district like ours, where children come 
from all over the world and often travel great distances each day to go to 
school, it's the farthest thing from the truth," said Hayes, director of 
nursing services for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about everything from malnourishment, severe dental problems and 
lack of immunizations, to post-traumatic stress syndrome in children from 
war-torn countries," she said. "In the past, those haven't exactly been your 
typical school nurse health concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, at the urging of school officials and community groups, the school 
district instituted a pilot program at eight Los Angeles and San Fernando 
Valley elementary schools to meet those student health needs. Under the 
Capacity Adjustment Program (CAP), school nurses were assigned to different 
schools each week to screen students for health care and other support 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Children from low-income families were referred to school-affiliated clinics, 
where dental, vision and other health services are provided on a sliding-scale 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
Since its inception, the program has been expanded to address the needs of 
about 35,000 students who travel by bus to school, according to CAP Resource 
Coordinator Modesta Bassity. CAP now includes 14 traveling nurses -- 11 of whom 
serve 60 schools in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We can catch problems a lot quicker now that interfere with learning," said 
Jayne Lawson, a former pediatric nurse who travels to various schools in the 
Valley. "A lot of times, the parents haven't known what to do or where to go." 
</P>
<P>
Providing information to parents, Lawson said, is often an essential part of 
the program. Lawson recalled one recent health screening of an 8-year-old 
Latino girl who lives in Los Angeles and attends an elementary school in the 
Valley. The girl's teacher had sent the child to see Lawson after noticing that 
she was sleepy in class and had difficulty paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lawson noted immediately that the girl was underweight for her age, 
further checking revealed that she received breakfast each day at school. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until I looked at her teeth that I understood the problem," Lawson 
said. "She had such massive cavities that her teeth had eroded away to little 
nubs. It was horrible. Eating was painful for her." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson contacted the girl's parents and told them about low-cost dental 
services that were available through the school district. Later, she visited 
the parents at their home to discuss the importance of proper nutrition and 
hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother was very concerned, but she hadn't had any idea about what foods 
were good for her child," she said. "She had been giving her foods that were 
very high in sugar and didn't know very much about protein." 
</P>
<P>
Children are also screened by traveling nurses for vision problems that, nurses 
say, often have gone undetected or untreated. Through two district-affiliated 
clinics in the Valley, children who qualify can receive low-cost glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of poor families, dental and vision problems are low priorities," 
said Janis Lake, who works as a traveling school nurse in Granada Hills. "A lot 
of the children literally cannot see, but the parents haven't known that these 
services were available." 
</P>
<P>
Cultural and language differences can exacerbate health problems. The Los 
Angeles Unified School District has seven major ethnic groups and as many as 90 
different languages spoken in its schools. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Hughes, another traveling school nurse and past president of the 
Council of School Nurses, said she sees many cases that require contacting 
parents and providing nutritional information. "We send letters home with the 
children, but many times the parents can't read. That's when we call. When you 
have children from Cambodia and Vietnam, where they lived on rice and water for 
a long time, the parents need to realize how the children have been physically 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
There also have been cases in which a child complains of an ailment, such as a 
stomachache or headache, for which no physical cause can be found. In such 
cases, Hayes said, the nurses often work as detectives, looking for something 
in the child's past that will give them a clue to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Some children show signs of post-traumatic stress from war, such as with 
children from El Salvador," Hayes said. "They've seen a lot of death and carry 
it around with them. We see the same thing in a lot of children from Los 
Angeles who have had family members killed by gangs," she said. "Sometimes you 
need to talk to a child to understand the source." 
</P>
<P>
For Lawson, who formerly worked as a pediatric nurse, the satisfaction she gets 
from her job far outweighs the occasional expression she sees when she tells 
people what she does for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"Telling people you are a school nurse can kind of be a conversation stopper, 
because they sometimes have that look of, 'Big deal.' But it is a big deal," 
she said. "We're reaching a lot of children, and we're making a big difference 
in their lives in what often are little ways." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson smiled. "Not everyone can say that."

HOLLYWOOD MARRIAGES CAN BE HIGH ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the course of a dozen years on movie sets, Annie Coe learned first-hand how 
stressful filmmaking can be. She saw the toll that long hours and 
unpredictability took both on herself and on her 15-year relationship with a 
local filmmaker. But when Coe began training as a therapist at the California 
Family Study Center in North Hollywood, she was amazed to learn that no one had 
ever made a systematic study of the impact the many stresses of the 
entertainment business have on filmmakers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised at the dearth of information," Coe said. "I spent days in 
front of the computers at school. There were studies of the effects of stress 
on rock musicians and comedians but nothing on filmmakers." 
</P>
<P>
Coe remedied that situation last year by studying how 10 filmmakers and their 
families react to the stresses of the world's most glamorous profession. The 
study helped earn her a master's degree in marriage and family therapy (the 
North Hollywood counseling center and training facility has an accredited 
master's program). According to faculty at the school, the study is also an 
important first step toward developing reality-based counseling programs for 
entertainment families with problems. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Harway, the center's director of research, said Coe's study "blazes new 
territory." Such studies are important, she said, "because we live in an area 
where there are so many families that are affected directly or indirectly by 
the entertainment industry." To counsel such families effectively, she said, 
"it's important to have empirical information." 
</P>
<P>
Now an intern at the school, Coe, who hopes to specialize in counseling 
entertainment families, plans to study additional filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
A Silver Lake resident in her early 40s, Coe said "filmmaker" was her generic 
term for anyone directly involved in making TV shows or movies. Her own 
filmmaking experience included working as Orson Welles' assistant during the 
shooting of his unfinished, unreleased film, "The Other Side of the Wind." 
Welles would sometimes wake her up in the middle of the night to send a telex, 
but the chance to hear the great man reminisce, in a purple robe, with a brandy 
in his hand, more than made up for it, the English-born Coe said. 
</P>
<P>
Recruited through Coe's industry contacts, the subjects of her study were 10 
filmmakers -- seven men and three women -- who "were successful but not famous" 
and their mates. They included a producer, a director, an actor, a stand-in, a 
set decorator and a screenwriter. All had been married at least four years, one 
for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
Coe interviewed each of the couples for as long as four hours, using a 
questionnaire she developed based on earlier research on occupational stress. 
She also took notes as the filmmakers and their spouses made comments and 
observations. 
</P>
<P>
As Coe anticipated, the study revealed that filmmaking is an unusually 
stressful business, largely because of unpredictability. However, most of the 
filmmakers and their families had found strategies that helped them minimize 
the pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually everything about the business is unpredictable," including salary, 
work hours, locations and periods of employment, Coe said. As one of her 
subjects put it, "at least the unpredictability is expected." Unpredictability 
extended to whether filmmakers would show up for their interviews, Coe said. 
Interviews with filmmakers had to be rescheduled for numerous reasons, 
including a last-minute shoot in Seattle and a fire on a set. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the unpredictable aspects of the business, periods of unemployment of 
uncertain length seemed to take the biggest toll. 
</P>
<P>
"Most subjects stated that being unemployed is the most stressful aspect of the 
business," Coe said. Eighty percent of the filmmakers said they suffered from 
anxiety and depression whenever they were out of work for more than three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The actor reported that periods of unemployment provoke emotional chaos for 
him, reminiscent of the internal chaos he experienced as a child being brought 
up by alcoholic parents," Coe said. She said the actor's wife was aware of how 
troubled he was when the phone wasn't ringing and was especially supportive at 
such times. 
</P>
<P>
All the filmmakers reported that they reduced some of the anxiety associated 
with unemployment by making sure they were financially prepared for it. One 
woman said she and her husband always have enough in the bank to cover their 
expenses for six months. Even the seven couples who were financially secure 
said they tended to be anxious during periods of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Working brought its own strains, the study found. While being employed 
alleviated fears about money and subtler concerns about whether others 
perceived the filmmaker as a good hire, working took its toll at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine subjects and their spouses reported that less strain exists in the 
relationship when the filmmakers were unemployed," Coe said. The couples said 
they enjoyed their leisure time together and the chance to do things and visit 
with people they had to put off when the filmmaker was working. Only one couple 
reported they were happiest when the filmmaker had a job. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the couples said working took its toll on their physical 
relationship. Some of the filmmakers said they enjoyed talking with their 
spouses when they finally got home after a day of shooting. But two said they 
didn't want to speak to anyone, only to eat something, take a hot bath and fall 
into bed. Most of the spouses reported that they had become much more 
understanding about these patterns in recent years (only one said she still 
gets furious, but she blamed the business, not her husband). 
</P>
<P>
All the spouses reported that in the past they had made meals for their working 
filmmaker, only to have the food grow cold as they grew hot. Now, they said, 
they don't waste a lot of time in the kitchen when their mates are on the set. 
(Coe refers to the reliance on meals that will keep as "the salad syndrome.") 
</P>
<P>
Coe said the filmmakers typically made an extra effort to take good physical 
care of themselves when they were working. Two take megadoses of vitamins and 
another drinks ginseng tea. All the subjects said working was made less 
stressful by supportive spouses. Most said the camaraderie of the set helped 
reduce the stress of working. One exception was the director, probably, Coe 
speculated, because the director's responsibilities proliferate during filming. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 filmmakers said they help bring stress levels down by consciously 
reminding themselves, "This, too, shall pass" or "It's only a movie." 
</P>
<P>
Coe said she was surprised at how strong the filmmakers' marriages were. To a 
person, she said, the 10 spouses were independent, self-confident and able to 
find fulfillment in their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
And in spite of Hollywood's image as a hotbed of infidelity, nine of the 10 
said they felt secure in their marriages, without concerns about infidelity. 
The sole exception was a wife who always goes on location with her filmmaker 
husband, just in case.

Jet-Set Flowers 
</P>
<P>
From the fields of Holland to a warehouse in Van Nuys in fewer than 72 hours -- 
fresh flowers are rushed to the Mid-Valley Flower Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the wholesale florist's blossoms are shipped downtown to Wall Street or 
to the airport, said owner Ralph Stokes. "We have a guy who goes to the airport 
at 5 a.m. to pick them up, and we have another guy who goes downtown from 10 
p.m. to 4 a.m. to buy." 
</P>
<P>
It's a veritable United Nations within the Van Nuys warehouse. Orchids -- 
mainly dendrobiums and oncidiums -- come from Thailand. Liatrises, anemones and 
gerberas arrive from Israel. Tuberoses, calla lilies and agapanthuses are from 
the fields of Mexico, while roses and carnations are flown in from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
What about that quintessential exporter, Japan? "Nope. Japan is a big importer 
of California flowers," Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
Proteas and anthuriums are shipped in from Hawaii, and local growers from 
Oxnard and San Diego are also heavily represented. 
</P>
<P>
The warehouse, at 7625 Hayvenhurst Ave., is open from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday 
through Friday and 7:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Where Would You Hide It? 
</P>
<P>
Missing: one 20-foot-tall, $8,500 chicken. 
</P>
<P>
The inflatable chicken was sitting on the roof of El Pollo Loco at Sepulveda 
Boulevard and Saugus Avenue in Sherman Oaks, making its Southern California 
debut. For two weeks it amused passers-by, until someone climbed up on the roof 
and stole it. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff came in on a Monday morning and noticed it was gone," said Barry 
Kurtz, president of Chicken Enterprises Ltd., which owns the 17-restaurant 
chain. "It's of absolutely no use to anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The thief also stole the blower, which keeps the chicken inflated. "The thing 
would automatically deflate when the blower was unplugged, so they could roll 
it up and carry it away," said Joe Masiello, director of operations for the 
Southern California franchise group. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't ask me what someone would do with it," he said. "If you put it in your 
yard, someone would notice it." 
</P>
<P>
It was a particularly bold crime when you consider that kitty-cornered from the 
building is a 24-hour gas station. "No one here noticed it happening, but we've 
had things happen right here on our own lot that we haven't noticed," said Pat 
Sawdon, manager of Judy's Mobil Station. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever finds the inflatable chicken will be given some real chicken as a 
reward, Masiello promised. 
</P>
<P>
Shake, Rattle and Poll 
</P>
<P>
After the Oct. 1, 1987, Whittier earthquake, the Southern California Earthquake 
Preparedness Project (SCEPP) conducted a poll to see whether individuals and 
families in Los Angeles County were more prepared for one than they were back 
in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Three areas of earthquake preparedness were covered: supplies; hazard 
mitigation; and instruction, training and planning. 
</P>
<P>
There's some good news and some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
People seem to be doing a significantly better job in maintaining supplies of 
food, first-aid kits and water within their homes, said Jim Goltz, who is a 
third of the way through writing up the study. "In the 1977 survey, only 17.1% 
of the people said they stored water, and, in our 1989 survey, 68.5% said they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
In hazard mitigation, though, progress is uneven. "The question about bracing 
your hot-water heater wasn't even on the 1977 survey," Goltz noted. "This time 
a little over 37% said they'd done that." Yet Goltz noted that only 11% of the 
people polled said they had bothered with structural reinforcements to their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
More than 54% of those polled said they've learned first aid, and nearly 75% 
said they know how to turn off the gas, electricity and water. 
</P>
<P>
"What's lagging behind is preparedness at the community level," he said. "For 
example, less than 10% had set up a neighborhood responsibility plan for the 
children and elderly." 
</P>
<P>
One of SCEPP's tasks is to promote earthquake planning at the neighborhood and 
block level. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard

LAKES SHIMMERS, MEIER SHINES IN WAGNER CONCERT 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its modest 25-year span, San Diego Opera has hardly been a hotbed of 
Wagnerian enthusiasm. Thanks to the vision of founding director Walter Herbert, 
the company traversed the mighty "Ring" cycle in annual installments from 
1974-77, but Herbert's successors have rarely dipped into the Wagner canon. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's all-Wagner concert at the Civic Theatre, however, made some modest 
amends for this neglect, and, more important, served as the lure to bring the 
young American tenor Gary Lakes to San Diego for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
If the concert's first half seemed unduly slight -- it was a potpourri of four 
short arias and three overtures -- the compelling, post-intermission 
performance of the first act of "Die Walkure" vindicated the entire 
undertaking. Under Heinz Fricke's authoritative baton, soloists and an expanded 
on-stage orchestra offered a sweeping, intense and stylistically sympathetic 
concert performance. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Johanna Meier, who graced the local opera stage in memorable 
performances in the 1970s, projected a Sieglinde of affecting beauty. Meier 
inflected the vocal line with gleaming yet limpid tone and uncommon 
sensitivity. Her joyous encounter of her lost brother, Siegmund, was the work's 
emotional linchpin. 
</P>
<P>
As Siegmund, Lakes warmed up appreciably from his tentative arias in the first 
half. Pursuing the familiar outlines of a part he has often sung, he brought 
requisite ardor to the role, although he still seemed stiff in comparison to 
Meier. The clarion strength of his voice, even sweeter on top than in other 
ranges, is clearly this aspiring heldentenor's calling card. 
</P>
<P>
John Macurdy, a last-minute replacement for German bass Artur Korn, projected a 
stern and aptly stentorian Hunding, negotiating his chiseled lines with 
assurance and conviction. In his only other appearance in the concert, he 
sailed through Daland's humorous aria from the second act of "The Flying 
Dutchman" with consummate ease. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Macurdy's sure technique has preserved his sonorous chords over the 
decades. (He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1962, about the time Lakes' 
voice was beginning to change.) 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his colleagues, Lakes sang his first-half arias with score in hand. His 
subdued "Almachtiger Vater" from "Rienzi" and Lohengrin's final "Mein lieber 
Schwan" suffered from overly deliberate phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
Meier brought dramatic flare to "Dich, teure Halle" from "Tannhauser," although 
the aria's athletic declamation was taxing and brought out an undeniable wobble 
in her lovely instrument. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the opera orchestra was the evening's surprise star. It was 
consistently responsive and flexible under Fricke's dramatic direction, 
especially in the flashy Prelude to Act III of "Lohengrin," in which the brass 
sections mustered well-focused brilliance and depth. 
</P>
<P>
Fricke, music director of the Berlin State Opera, made his American debut with 
this concert and will return to San Diego Opera in 1992 for the season opening 
to conduct "Der Rosenkavalier."

TV Movie Set on Sex Video Case: A 23-year-old woman who was awarded a 
$1.1-million judgment after she was secretly videotaped having sex has reached 
an agreement with a producer to film a television movie about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Susan Leigh Kerr said Tuesday that a NBC Monday Night Movie will 
be made by Los Angeles producer Joan Barnett. Kerr, a senior at Texas Tech 
University, won the judgment and attracted national attention last June after 
she filed suit against her former boyfriend, Dan Boyles Jr., and four other men 
who secretly taped her having sex with Boyles. The tape later was played for 
Boyle's college fraternity members. CLAUDIA PUIG

Bedding Down With John and Yoko: Pop fans will have the chance to sleep in the 
Amsterdam hotel room where John Lennon and Yoko Ono held their famous "bed-in" 
for world peace in 1969. To mark the 21st anniversary of the couple's 
celebrated protest, the Amsterdam Hilton has re-created the bedroom suite and 
is charging guests $750 a night to sleep there. 
</P>
<P>
One item will be missing -- the original bed used by Lennon and his wife. "We 
change all our beds every five years or so. I've no idea what happened to the 
original one," said Hilton spokesman Jan van der Putten. "We are refurbishing 
the suite as it was at the time, but with a few extra modern comforts like a 
whirlpool and a complete set of Lennon's music on compact disc." The former 
Beatle, who was murdered outside his New York apartment 10 years ago, and his 
wife held court to the world press from their bed in 1969, calling for 
universal love and staying in bed for several days, surrounded by flowers and 
posters. CLAUDIA PUIG

Jackson Removes Black Leopard From Act: Singer Janet Jackson says she won't use 
a black leopard in her act because fans have expressed concern about its 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said through her publicist on Tuesday that she removed the leopard from 
her act in New York, where she performed last week. Some audience members 
worried the animal could be harmed being carted from location to location on 
Jackson's current worldwide tour. Jackson, sister of singer Michael Jackson, is 
a noted animal lover. "I love animals and would never do any harm, or allow 
anyone to do any harm to one," she said. "I would rather do without the cat."

DARIO D'AMBROSI CASTS A ONE-MAN FANTASY WITH 'TROUT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italy's Dario d'Ambrosi is back and he's at it again. Not that he visits often. 
In fact, not often enough. But he's back at Stages Trilingual Theatre doing his 
amazing, unnerving thing: Giving us undecorated slices of life in a mental 
patient's internal world, as observed by him in the psychiatric hospital of 
Rome's Santa Maria della Pieta. 
</P>
<P>
Stop. That's only partially accurate. His latest piece, "La Trotta" ("The 
Trout"), which opened Tuesday, is actually part observation, part pure flight 
of fancy. Just like "Nemico Mio" ("Enemy of Mine"), the piece d'Ambrosi brought 
to Stages in December, 1988, and again last week, it focuses on a man obsessed 
with his body and bodily functions, but also with the image of a fish -- the 
trout of the title -- and his inability to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
Just exactly how real this trout is, one can't tell -- any more than just 
exactly where this man is that d'Ambrosi plays. The "room" he lives in could be 
a sidewalk cardboard shack, a cell in a mental institution, perhaps a real 
room. But there's no question that the fellow is riddled with physical and 
psychological tics, and that we're taken in and out of reality during 
d'Ambrosi's hourlong monologue. 
</P>
<P>
It begins innocuously enough, with the man sitting in a chair trying to mend a 
broken plate. He talks, to no one in particular. It's a ramble filled with 
astute observations. He has an aching tooth and eventually, he pulls it -- with 
a string tied to his chair. 
</P>
<P>
There is great reverence and humor here -- a reverence for life, for its 
minutiae, for body parts. Such as pulled teeth. "Why don't we have a cemetery 
for the teeth?" he asks in irresistible broken English sparked with occasional 
Italian, as he plunges into a delicious dissertation on the possibilities of 
such a place. 
</P>
<P>
"There lie the molars of Giovanni Franceschini," he intones, visualizing the 
grave with glee. "Here lie the teeth of the entire Canalotti family." Just 
think, he adds, positively transported with pleasure, you could go visit. 
</P>
<P>
Now why didn't anyone else think of that? D'Ambrosi goes on to propose that we 
set up similar graveyards for arms and legs and other losable parts of the 
body. He also rhapsodizes on the joys of defecation, but so artfully that, 
while sacrificing nothing of an ultra-graphic reality that borders dangerously 
on bad taste, he averts both offense and grotesquerie. The same applies to a 
barely verbal but explicit sexual sequence. These are molto grandi risks he 
excels at -- and that takes plenty of talent. 
</P>
<P>
What, do you say, does any of this have to do with a trout? We're just getting 
to that. Mental patients tend to be intensely involved with their bodies, and 
another intense physical process is the ingestion of food. When this man 
decides he's hungry, it's specific. He determines he wants a nice fresh fish 
for dinner -- and goes after one. 
</P>
<P>
From this point on, reality and fantasy blur. He buys a fish -- either for real 
or in his imagination, we'll never know. He puts it in a sink filled with water 
and, lo and behold, the fish is so fresh that it lives! Now that's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
How does a man eat a fish without killing it, which, after a couple of abortive 
attempts, he decides he would rather not do? Well, he might try to get someone 
else to kill it for him (no luck) or he might try to talk the fish into 
committing suicide (again, no luck). It doesn't occur to him to take the fish 
out of water. 
</P>
<P>
What occurs to him instead is to dive into the pool. Suddenly we're submerged 
in total surreality, and man and fish are swimming together underwater with a 
rather finite fishy finish for the man. 
</P>
<P>
Clever idea, yes, but disappointingly executed at the bitter end, where a 
rudimentary set by Jim Sweeters crudely devaluates the soaring notion behind 
it. 
</P>
<P>
It's doubly too bad because, up to that point, the show, as confined and narrow 
as it is, is quite a magnificent personal feat. 
</P>
<P>
One suggestion for the actor: No need for goggles or a snorkel if the idea is 
that the man is totally underwater. A snorkel serves no purpose and goggles are 
gratuitous since we are firmly in a floating realm of the imagination here. 
</P>
<P>
And it's an exceptional imagination that deserves now to break out into other 
material. Not because d'Ambrosi doesn't do this material superlatively, but 
because one is curious to see what else he holds in store. "La Trotta" is as 
close to performance art as theater gets. And while it is a redoubtable piece 
of acting, it also remains a curio, and -- in the end certainly -- a slightly 
frustrating fishtail. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1540 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood, tonight through Saturday at 8 p.m., with 
a final matinee Sunday at 3. $20; (213) 463-5356.

THE 'MONOCLED MUTINEER': INTELLIGENT AND BLEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We colonials like a good time. That's why we insist on happy endings. On the 
other hand, there must be something in the English soul of souls that prefers 
twisted people lurching through desperation. 
</P>
<P>
The recent case in point was Frederic Raphael's "After the War," which we saw 
on "Masterpiece Theatre" about a lot of hateful people hating everybody, 
themselves included -- but with incredible wit. The new case in point is "The 
Monocled Mutineer," a BBC production that airs its first episode tonight at 10 
on KCET Channel 28. Three others air on successive Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Bleasdale adapted the true-life adventure book by William Allison and John 
Fairley about the elusive Percy Tomlis, who, as history tells it (the script 
doesn't agree), led the 1917 mutiny of English and Australian soldiers at the 
brutal British training camp in France. He was lionized as Britain's "most 
wanted man." It's "The Fugitive" all over again. Without the happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, is later in this story. Tonight we watch young Percy's stark 
childhood through his enlistment at 17 in the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1915 
and the horror and stench of war. 
</P>
<P>
Paul McGann, a young actor of great promise, portrays Percy Tomlis with an 
inner strength and an outer dash. In later episodes, veteran character actor 
Timothy West gives us a memorable portrait of the camp brigadier, who is ripped 
apart by his sense of duty and the growing, terrible realization that his duty 
is corrupt. In a way he represents the metaphor for an empire rotting from 
within. 
</P>
<P>
Director Jim O'Brien, who did "Jewel in the Crown," and his production and 
costume designers do a triumphant job of re-creating World War I -- it's 
anguishing to watch -- and Bleasdale's script is intelligent and bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad for Tomlis. Too bad he wasn't an American. He would have lived and 
gotten a terrific series on prime time, and a book deal, and got to meet 
Barbara Walters. IRV LETOFSKY

WHEN COOKING IS A GROUP EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
LEISURE: COOKING CLUBS CAN PROVIDE A WAY TO EAT WELL WHILE SHARPENING CULINARY 
SKILLS.

Cooking clubs are as varied as the dishes their members prepare. If you're 
interested in forming one with friends or neighbors, here are some tips to make 
sure many cooks in the kitchen don't spoil the broth: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Organize the cooking to accomplish particular goals. If you just want to 
eat well, assign each guest a dish or course to bring; the host can prepare one 
course or only be responsible for the setup, cleanup and beverages. If the goal 
is to share expertise and to learn new techniques, cook as a group, assigning 
each person a task. That way, everyone will learn how to make the dish, and no 
single member will be burdened with too much work. Cooking together renders 
failures more acceptable and less threatening, provides more opportunity to 
learn from each other and analyze the procedures, and is generally more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Settle ahead on a budget and the method for sharing expenses (usually 
adding up everyone's bills and dividing equally). Avoid buying ingredients that 
are expensive when the recipe calls for only a small proportion of the package 
-- a tablespoon of Madeira wine, for example. If no member has a bottle of 
Madeira from which to donate a tablespoon, substitute with another flavoring or 
split up the leftover wine among members. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In planning the menu, consider the dinner as a whole. Including several 
heavy, rich or complicated dishes may start as a challenge but finish as an 
invitation to indigestion. Consider a theme, perhaps ethnic or seasonal. Select 
dishes that use techniques you would like to practice, such as souffles, 
poached or steamed fish, or puff pastry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Choose recipes carefully. They should suit taste, be worth the effort, not 
take longer or cost more than you are willing to spend and fit the rest of the 
menu. If you are tackling difficult recipes that are unfamiliar, choose from 
sources -- such as the cookbooks of Julia Child or Madeleine Kamman -- that 
include a lot of instruction and tips with the recipe. Keep in mind that some 
recipes won't work, and chalk them up to education. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Select dishes that can be prepared in the allotted time with plenty of 
leeway for missteps. If preparing dishes that take more than two hours, assign 
some do-ahead steps (such as stock-making) to members. Have food to nibble and 
beverages available for the cooks while they work, or prepare a quick hors 
d'oeuvre at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If it is necessary to buy dishes and glasses for a large group, check 
restaurant-supply houses before you consider disposables or buy at retail 
stores. A case of wine glasses or gilt-rimmed plates might cost less than three 
dinners' worth of disposables. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Decide cleanup division ahead of time. Everyone might stay to the bitter 
end, or you might compensate the host with less work or expense in return for 
doing the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agree ahead of time whether children are going to be included in the 
cooking and the dining. Set guidelines for their supervision so a parent is not 
expected to chase after a toddler while cooking the crepes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A cooking club should be cooperative rather than competitive. Find out what 
each member would like to learn to do and what each does particularly well and 
could teach the others. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Above all, don't tackle too much, whether it's too many dishes or too 
complex a meal. Fun should be calculated into the formula.

THE BUTCHER: BEEF INDUSTRY CHANGES EMPHASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The beef industry has convinced itself that it is now, at long last, a 
"consumer-driven" industry. What that means in public relations language is 
that the beef industry has convinced itself that it is now producing a product 
that meets the demands of today's consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gary Smith, head of the Texas A &amp; M Animal Science Department and a 
leading meat scientist, said at a recent conference in Seattle called "A Report 
Card on Beef" that the beef industry has changed from a strictly 
production-oriented business to a much more consumer-driven business. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he said, consumers are now being supplied with leaner, more 
closely trimmed cuts of beef. "The beef industry," Smith remarked, "has made 
remarkable progress in repositioning its products as healthful and contemporary 
in caloric content, and further progress can be expected in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of modern beef has come to light as the result of a Kansas State 
University project funded by Denver's Beef Promotion and Research Board. It 
indicates, for one thing, that the cholesterol content of beef is not affected 
by the type of grain fed to cattle. 
</P>
<P>
Of more interest to the beef consumer is the board's finding that the 
cholesterol content of lean tissue in certain steaks, trimmed of external fat, 
does not increase as marbling increases. This confirms the results of previous 
studies indicating the cholesterol content of beef does not vary among 
different cuts and grades. Therefore, the researchers concluded, customers can 
select higher-quality beef cuts without the fear of getting more dietary 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another study, this one conducted by researchers at a USDA center in 
Nebraska, illustrates that the beef industry has a rich diversity of genetics 
to produce whatever today's customer wants. 
</P>

Researchers crossed sires from 13 different breeds with Angus, Hereford and 
Shorthorn dams. As expected, breed was found to have a definite effect on 
marbling. More interesting was the finding that even when fat content doubled, 
flavor, juiciness and tenderness scores changed very little. "That leads one to 
wonder," the study concludes, "whether a push for well-marbled steak is worth 
the effort. Certainly noteworthy is the strong negative relationship between 
marbling and retail product."

<P>
What all of these studies (which are funded by money from the "beef check-off" 
program and the Beef Promotion and Research Board) are doing above all else is 
sending a very mixed message to the consumer about beef.

CHERIMOYA: THE 'ARISTOCRAT OF FRUIT'; 
</P>
<P>
EXOTIC: BECAUSE IT MUST BE HAND-POLLINATED AND CANNOT BE PRODUCED EASILY, IT IS 
VERY EXPENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cherimoya, a subtropical fruit originally from the highlands of Ecuador and 
Peru, has been grown in Southern California for more than a century but has 
been only recently available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The mature crop appears from December through May in gourmet food markets and 
variety grocery stores. Because the cherimoya produces little fruit naturally 
and the flowers must be hand-pollinated, the fruit is especially expensive, 
even in season ($7 per pound). Those lucky enough to have a back yard tree have 
their pick of the "aristocrat of fruit," as it is called by aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Twain hailed the cherimoya as "deliciousness itself," and Baron Alexander 
von Humbolt, a German scientist and explorer, was said to have thought the 
cherimoya worth a trip across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit, with its green warty skin, as exotic as something out of science 
fiction, can deceive those who are not acquainted with its creamy, custard-like 
white flesh and tantalizing, juicy-sweet flavor, hinting of flavors of 
pineapple, papaya and pear. 
</P>
<P>
Cherimoyas have about 94 calories per one-third-pound serving and are high in 
niacin, phosphorus and thiamine. 
</P>
<P>
You can leave cherimoyas on the counter to form a brownish green skin or until 
they yield to gentle pressure, both indicate ripeness. Once ripe, however, the 
fruit should be refrigerated and eaten within the week. 
</P>
<P>
And just how does one eat it? 
</P>
<P>
Cut the fruit in half and spoon out the flesh as you would papaya or avocado, 
making sure to remove the seeds embedded into the crevices. 
</P>
<P>
Cherimoyas also can be sliced or cubed and added raw to fruit bowls, salads or 
sauces. Some hosts serve cherimoya sliced and splashed with orange juice and 
sprinkled with coconut. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit can be made into a drink by mixing the flesh in a blender with some 
water or fruit juice and may be sweetened with honey or sugar. The pulp may 
also be teamed with banana, pineapple or other tropical fruit flavors for an 
interesting shake. 
</P>
<P>

ABOUT WINE: KUDOS FOR THE CAYMUS CABERNET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RUTHERFORD, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To collectors of California Cabernet Sauvignons, there is an immediate, 
visceral response when new vintage wines are released from wineries such as 
Stag's Leap, Mondavi, Heitz, Dunn, Forman, and Spottswoode. 
</P>
<P>
Include at the top of that list Caymus. For those unfamiliar with the name, it 
should be stated up front that for my money no producer of high-quality 
Cabernet Sauvignon in the state exceeds Caymus for either quality or 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
And with its 1985 Special Selection Cabernet, Caymus achieves its pinnacle 
wine. Rarely if ever has a Cabernet struck me with as much impact. The amazing 
violet-spice complexity wrapped around a carload of berrylike, cherry-ish fruit 
play tag with nuances of vanilla, toasted oak and faint cigar-box scents to 
produce one of the most intense wines ever made in California. The taste is 
hard to describe, so packed with currant and chocolate flavor and yet the wine 
is not heavy-handed in any way. 
</P>
<P>
This is a baby, needing years before it'll show all the grace and richness 
buried deep within. Yet it can be consumed with great pleasure today, it's so 
well balanced. Tasting the wine, I was reminded of a description of a great but 
supple Cabernet I heard years ago: an iron fist in a velvet glove. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there are other great Cabernets out there, but for sheer strength of 
varietal character and depth, the '85 Caymus SS, as fans call it, is to my mind 
the ultimate treat. 
</P>
<P>
Now the bad news, and its twofold: There's hardly any of the wine available, 
and if you find a bottle, it'll likely be higher than its released price of 
$55. Demand has been high by the cognoscenti. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Caymus, one sees a winery that looks pretty much as it did nearly two 
decades ago when crusty Napa Valley grape grower Charles Wagner founded the 
place. The wine making facility is small; barrels are stacked hither and yon. 
You need a forklift to get at any barrel beyond the first tier. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Wagner, son of the owner, is the wine maker these days, but like his 
father (who remains the figurehead of the winery), he believes strongly that 
the grapes give him all he needs for his wines. Thus he experiments constantly 
in the vineyards, trying various trellising and planting systems, different 
rootstocks and changing growing conditions to gain the complexity he desires. 
</P>
<P>
His soil-testing experiments may yet produce some revolutionary growing methods 
for Cabernet in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner is a low-key fellow who views his wine making methods proprietarily, yet 
he is eager to note that Caymus Special Selection is entirely Cabernet 
Sauvignon; no Merlot or Petite Verdot is added. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he is proud of the fact that the grapes he harvests from his 40-acre 
property east of the Napa River have such strong fruit components that the wine 
can spend as much as three years in oak barrels before being bottled and still 
not lose its aroma. 
</P>
<P>
Another element to this wine is the fact that after fermentation in steel 
tanks, it is racked into upright wooden vats for some months to settle before 
going into the small oak barrels, a procedure used by only a few wineries. 
</P>
<P>
"Our process requires a lot of air in the wine," said Wagner. "We think it 
livens the wine up." But he said each barrel is tasted before it is racked to 
another vessel and each barrel is treated as if it were completely separate 
from the others (which, of course, it is). 
</P>
<P>
For those who can't find or afford the Special Selection, a superb 
approximation of it is Caymus Napa Valley Cabernet, which recently leaped in 
price from $18 to $22 because of demand. (Some stores may not yet have marked 
bottles up.) The 1985 and 1986 Caymus Napa Valley Cabernets are spectacular 
wines in their own right, both of which will age handsomely for a decade or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
If you feel $22 is a bit high for a Cabernet, consider this: I have tasted the 
1985 many times and its wonderful cherry/olive/mint complexity and pipe tobacco 
nuances remind me of most other people's reserve wines. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in a blind tasting two weeks ago, 1985 Caymus Napa Valley finished 
third of eight wines, topped only by the new 1985 Fetzer Reserve ($24) and 1985 
Cain Five ($30). 
</P>
<P>
Caymus Cabernets age as well as any I have tasted. This was proved again at a 
tasting staged by Caymus at Highlands Inn in Carmel two weeks ago, during the 
Masters of Food and Wine event. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner poured his 1983, 1984 and 1985 Special Selection wines for a small group 
of tasters and the '85 was favored by a shade over the '84, though I liked the 
latter because it was slightly more developed. An extra year in the bottle has 
helped the '84 become more impressive; the '85 will show even better a year 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
But all agreed that this was mere hair-splitting because even the '83, from a 
rather awkward year in California, still was magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
A third Caymus Cabernet, called Napa Valley Cuvee, is another winner from this 
small property, and each succeeding wine with this designation is better than 
the last. The 1986, just released at $15, is a marvelous wine that recently 
scored better than 1985 Dominus ($47) in a blind tasting. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Caymus has given up making a Chardonnay because, said Wagner, 
"We weren't among the best ones being made, so why keep making it?" 
</P>
<P>
But Caymus 1987 Zinfandel ($9.75) continues the winery's long tradition with 
this California variety. The deep spice character of the fruit is accented by a 
hint of pine (from aging in American oak barrels). This rough-hewn wine goes 
well with pasta. 
</P>
<P>
A new hit for Caymus is its 1986 Pinot Noir ($15). The elder Wagner long has 
been proud of his Pinot Noir, yet only now and then did the wines ring true to 
varietal type. But with a new source of grapes for this 1986 wine, the result 
is a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
The mint, toast and cherry-like fruit depict Pinot character in full and the 
aftertaste is lush and approachable. Fruit from Yountville and Carneros 
provides better character than the grapes once used from the center of the Napa 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The finishing touches are now being put on a 27,000 square foot building that 
will eventually house the barrels and case goods, and that will free up winery 
space so the Wagners can make even more of their Liberty School wines that have 
become a prime second label for Caymus. 
</P>
<P>
Some 66,000 cases of the Liberty School wine are now made, and Liberty School 
Cabernet, previously a good value, should improve markedly in the coming years 
because the winery has purchased better Cabernet grapes and wine to blend and 
age than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The Special Selection Cabernet, however, is the wine everyone wants, and demand 
for it was so high and production so small (1,000 cases) that some retailers 
and restaurants wound up getting shortchanged on orders they expected to get. 
One top Napa Valley restaurant wound up getting just three bottles of the wine 
and now isn't sure who will have the right to consume it. 
</P>
<P>
A spectacular redesigned label and classic tapered bottle make the package 
worth seeing. 
</P>
<P>
Another point about this wine is that it is a true collectable. Caymus Special 
Selection wines typically rise in value rapidly after they are released. The 
1978 Special Selection, the first one made in large quantity (600 cases) sold 
initially for $30. Today it has a value of $100. Even Caymus' Napa 
Valley-designated Cabernets have a much higher value in time. The 1974, which 
was released at $7.50, now has a retail/auction price well above $100. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for this is that Caymus makes excellent Cabernets even in the "off" 
vintages, making them sort of the California version of Chateau Latour. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Markham Chardonnay ($12) -- Lovely aroma of pears and 
tropical fruit and a delicate honeysuckle undertone make this wine immediately 
likeable. But there's also a hint of oak and a soft, appealing finish. With 
prices for California Chardonnay going up rapidly, this wine represents 
excellent value.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SOLUTIONS TO INTESTINAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The advertising is delicately phrased in terms like "intestinal irregularity." 
But a rose by any other name is still a rose, and constipation, however 
discreetly described, is constipation. In this country, easing the problem is a 
booming business. Over-the-counter remedies sell like hot cakes, even though 
some carry risk of side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Just as mouthwash, soap and deodorant ads can cause hitherto unconcerned 
consumers to worry if their breaths or bodies don't smell fresh enough, 
manufacturers of products to step up bowel activity may encourage us to 
question whether we are as "regular" as we should be. If not, they hope we'll 
turn to laxatives or stool softeners for relief. 
</P>
<P>
But is the concept of "normal" bowel activity a valid one? And when 
difficulties do occur, are drugs the solution? In both cases, the answer is not 
always yes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a recent large-scale study under the leadership of Dr. James P. Everhart 
of the National Institutes of Health, has gathered new and useful information 
about our bowel habits. Two nationwide surveys, encompassing more than 10,000 
people, were conducted 10 years apart in order to learn about bowel function 
and how patterns changed over time. 
</P>
<P>
At the first interview, subjects were asked three questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do you have trouble with your bowels that makes you constipated or gives 
you diarrhea? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How often do you usually have a bowel movement? 
</P>
<P>
 -- During the past six months, have you used any medicine, drug or pills for 
bowel trouble? 
</P>
<P>
At the second interview, the first two questions were repeated and two more 
asked: 
</P>
<P>
 -- How often do you use a laxative or stool softener? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Which of the following best describes your usual bowel movement: Normal, 
loose or watery, or hard and very firm? 
</P>
<P>
Findings revealed that women were more likely than men to report constipation 
and infrequent bowel movements -- defined as three or fewer per week. Older 
people who reported constipation were more prone to use stool softeners or 
laxatives than were younger subjects who said they were constipated. Indeed, 
the proportion who said at both interviews that they used bowel medication 
increased from about 28% among the youngest group to nearly 58% in the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
But -- perhaps because they did use these products -- older individuals also 
were less likely than younger ones to have infrequent bowel movements. 
Researchers noted that whites were more likely to have daily bowel movements 
than were blacks (73% versus 64%). The reason for this finding remains 
unexplained. 
</P>
<P>
Impaired bowel function was associated with several factors, among them lower 
educational level, depression and decreased physical activity. No link to fiber 
consumption was identified, except at the extreme low end of intake, and then 
only among men. Bowel functioning was unrelated to relative fatness, coffee and 
tea consumption, smoking habits and, among women, to the number of children 
they had or use of estrogens. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics are interesting, but how do they apply to you? The first -- and 
perhaps most important -- point is that "normal" does not necessarily mean 
daily bowel movements. According to the study, many of us do not have daily 
bowel movements. Yet a much smaller number reported constipation at both 
interviews. Thus, normal bowel function spans a broad range, anywhere from two 
or three movements a day to as infrequently as once in three days. 
Constipation, therefore, must be understood in terms of what is normal for you. 
</P>
<P>
As for the failure to find an association between fiber and bowel function, 
that may well be explained by the generally low-fiber intake of the study 
population. It does not mean that fiber isn't helpful in promoting normal bowel 
functioning. Rather, ample evidence suggests that generous amounts of fiber -- 
in the form of fresh and lightly cooked fruits and vegetables, whole grains and 
dried legumes -- contribute to maintaining a healthy bowel. So too does 
drinking large amounts of fluid, as much as six to eight tall glasses a day. 
</P>
<P>
Practically speaking, one of the most crucial revelations of this study was the 
relationship between physical activity and bowel function. Sluggishness, 
headache, a bloated, gassy feeling and general abdominal discomfort, as well as 
hard feces that are difficult to pass, are symptoms that may not be 
life-threatening but can cause a general malaise. 
</P>
<P>
The link between impaired bowel function and low levels of physical activity 
(which, in other studies, has been strongly associated with depression) is just 
one more reason to exercise. In other words, if your bowel is sluggish, maybe 
you need to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
We suggest that people who worry about constipation conduct their own study. 
Ask yourself three questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What bowel-activity pattern is normal for me? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Am I eating fiber-rich foods and drinking plenty of liquids? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What is my exercise level? 
</P>
<P>
By thinking in these terms, you may be able to work out a solution that lets 
you skip a trip to the drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Putting Potatoes in Cold Storage 
</P>
<P>
Question: My daughter saw me taking potatoes out of the refrigerator and 
informed me that it was not the correct way to store them. She couldn't tell me 
why I was wrong, just that I was. I've always kept them there to avoid 
sprouting. Can you comment? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: At refrigerator temperatures, the starch in potatoes gradually converts 
to sugar. When cooked, potatoes with a higher sugar content tend to darken. 
</P>
<P>
Control of the conversion of starch to sugar is important commercially, where 
the optimal ratio of starch to sugar depends on how the potato is to be used. 
For example, if it's going into a prepared food such as canned hash or beef 
stew, the high temperatures used in processing could cause changes in flavor 
and color. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if some browning is desirable, as in frozen French fries or 
hash browns, then there must be enough sugar to allow the outsides to brown 
without extensive heat. Similarly, the light brown color of potato chips is 
dependent on adequate amounts of sugar. If sugar content of the potatoes rises 
too high, though, the chips can burn or become too dark. In order to achieve 
the correct sugar concentration, potatoes are sometimes stored under controlled 
conditions for as long as three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But let's get back to your kitchen. You can minimize risk of sprouting by 
storing potatoes in a cool, moist (but not humid) environment and by buying 
only as many as you can use within a reasonable period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Sprouting does not render potatoes unsafe. Just break or peel off the sprouts 
before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our daughter recently visited a nutritionist who claimed that just by 
looking in her eyes he could tell she was allergic to all dairy products and 
wheat. He said if she didn't cut out these foods, then eventually she would get 
colitis. He prescribed a B vitamin complex, an herb combination and a calcium 
supplement. He charged only $5 for the exam, which made me wonder if he was on 
the up-and-up or if he just gives these exams so he can charge a fortune for 
the vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your suspicions probably are right on target. From what you describe, he is 
basing his prognosis for your daughter on some variation of pseudoscientific 
practice sometimes called "irilogy." It's true that checking the eye, including 
the iris, can be an important part of health examinations that go well beyond 
the eye itself. However, irilogy carries the use of the eye for diagnosis to 
unreasonable limits. 
</P>
<P>
You mentioned that the supplements were expensive. That's not the only issue. 
Safety is another. Some B vitamins can be toxic if taken in large doses for a 
period of time. Similarly, the safety of herbal preparations depends on what 
they contain and in what amounts. Most herb teas, for example, have not been 
tested for safety. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps most important is that this man has placed your daughter on a 
restricted diet for no scientifically acceptable reason. If your daughter does 
have symptoms that suggest allergies, she may want to discuss them with her 
physician. He or she may, in turn, refer her to an allergy specialist, who is 
trained to make an accurate diagnosis and, if he finds an allergy, suggest a 
diet plan. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is buckwheat the same as bulgur wheat? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Bulgur is a lightly processed form of whole wheat produced by 
parboiling, drying and then breaking the whole-wheat kernels. It may be soaked, 
seasoned and eaten without further cooking, or it can be cooked with broth as a 
pilaf. It can also be cooked with water and served as breakfast cereal. Many 
people like to add yogurt, dried fruits or nuts to it. In a Middle Eastern 
version of meat loaf called kibbe, bulgur is mixed with ground lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Buckwheat, on the other hand, is not a true grain cereal. As with bulgur, the 
whole seed -- called buckwheat groats -- can be cooked and eaten by itself. But 
it is often combined with noodles. In this country, most of the buckwheat we 
consume is processed into flour and used in pancake mix. 
</P>
<P>
When cooked, both buckwheat groats and bulgur are calorically similar, 
providing about 200 calories per cup.

PESTO SALAD MAKES MOST OF SQUASH, BASIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pesto Marinated Salad is a combination of three varieties of squash and 
tomatoes, bathed in a deep-green basil dressing to make a stunning arrangement 
of colors. 
</P>
<P>
The squash are microwaved 6 minutes to tender-crispness, while the pesto 
dressing is whirled in the blender. 
</P>
<P>
The dressing is quickly tossed with the hot vegetables so they absorb maximum 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Toasted slivered almonds are then sprinkled on, taking the place of the 
traditional pine nuts to add extra crunch and flavor. 
</P>
<P>
PESTO MARINATED SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sliced crookneck squash 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sliced pattypan squash 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sliced zucchini 
</P>
<P>
2 cups basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 large tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Spread almonds in single layer on shallow glass baking dish and microwave on 
HIGH (100% power) 2 minutes. Stir, then allow to stand 1 minute. Cook on HIGH 1 
minute longer and cool. Or, to toast almonds in conventional oven, spread in 
single layer on baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees 5 to 8 minutes, stirring 
occasionally, until golden brown. Cool. 
</P>
<P>
Combine crookneck, patty pan and zucchini in 6-cup microwave baking dish and 
cover. Microwave on HIGH 6 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes, until 
tender-crisp. Combine 2 tablespoons almonds, basil leaves, garlic, oil and 
vinegar in blender and process until smooth. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Toss squash with pesto dressing and cool. Slice tomatoes into 1/4-inch thick 
slices and arrange around edge of serving platter. Toss squash with remaining 
almonds and spoon onto serving platter. Sprinkle with cheese and serve. Makes 6 
servings.

COUNCIL ENDS BATTLE WITH POLICE UNION; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: BOTH SIDES CALL THE NEW CONTRACT A "WIN-WIN" SITUATION, BUT IT CHIPS 
AWAY AT STAFFING POLICIES LONG PRIZED BY THE OFFICERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has ended one of the city's longest, most rancorous police 
labor disputes by approving a four-year contract with the police union that 
chips away at staffing policies long prized by the union. 
</P>
<P>
Though both sides are characterizing the new contract as a "win-win" 
arrangement, the pact clearly gives management a large foot in the door in 
terms of altering key personnel policies it insists contribute to the 
department's manpower shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the new contract scraps the requirement that all nighttime 
patrol units be staffed with two officers, allowing the department to make as 
many as half of the night units one-officer cars. And although the contract 
allows officers to continue working the department's standard four-day week of 
10-hour days if they want to, the police chief will have the option of 
assigning new hires to five-day weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The labor agreement also reduces the city's retirement costs -- and benefits -- 
for new hires, and makes members of the police union donate time to reimburse 
the city for releasing the union president from regular police duties. 
</P>
<P>
The one-officer car and four-day workweek issues were among the thorniest in a 
year of negotiations that quietly went nowhere for the first six months and 
then accelerated into open warfare that resulted in a lawsuit, threats of a 
strike, picketing and emotional condemnations from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The 620-member union, led by a scrappy sergeant who often wears a single 
pierced earring, succeeded in limiting the extent of the staffing changes while 
obtaining pay increases in exchange for the take-aways. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody really won and nobody really lost," remarked Mike Tracy, president of 
the Long Beach Police Officers Assn. "The agreement we came up with served both 
of our masters." Union members approved the contract last week. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the agreement has been signed, union leaders and city officials are 
plucking the chords of harmony, saying they want to start mending the strained 
relations of the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"My hope is we'll all get back to each doing what we do best," Councilwoman Jan 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The labor confrontation was sparked by citywide discontent over police services 
amid a spiraling crime rate that has become the leading political topic of the 
spring elections. 
</P>
<P>
Police administrators have said they need as many as 160 more officers, while 
city management embraced a private consultant's study that concluded the city's 
police shortage would be greatly alleviated if the department would use more 
one-officer cars and change its workweek. 
</P>
<P>
It was that study, presented to the City Council well after negotiations 
started last March, that turned the contract negotiations into a knockdown, 
drag-out fight. 
</P>
<P>
The union found the one-officer car proposal especially appalling, insisting 
that sending an officer out on the streets alone would be too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some major changes here," Mayor Ernie Kell said, commenting on why the 
bargaining turned into what Tracy called "the most heated and protracted in the 
history" of the police union. 
</P>
<P>
As the confrontation dragged on, the pressure mounted for both sides to settle. 
Last fall, a frustrated and angry City Council took the unusual step of 
declaring an impasse in the negotiations and voted to force its last contract 
offer on the union. 
</P>
<P>
The union lost its attempts to block the new work rules while it appealed the 
council's action to the state Court of Appeal, and was facing the prospect of 
having a contract it didn't like "rammed down its throat," as Tracy often put 
it. He was even briefly called back to regular duty and assigned to 
administrative work, forced to cut his hair and shed his earring. (The appeal 
will be dropped now that a contract has been signed.) 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the union became increasingly hostile to city leaders at a 
time when the mayor and a number of City Council members were seeking 
reelection. The union actively supported opponents to council incumbents, and 
says it will continue to do so in the April 10 local elections. But incumbents 
expect the union opposition now to be relatively low-key. 
</P>
<P>
The key provisions of the new contract include: 
</P>
<P>
* Pay raises of 5% retroactive to last July followed by raises of 4% to 8% next 
year and 5% to 8% in 1991, depending on consumer price index increases. Raises 
for the final year of the contract will be determined later in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
* Agreement that up to 50% of nighttime patrol units can be staffed by one 
officer, while those one-officer cars will be "teamed" in twos on their beats. 
The department has also agreed to maintain a minimum staffing level of patrol 
units, and will, if necessary, call officers in on overtime to meet those 
levels. One-officer cars assigned above and beyond the minimum staffing levels 
will not necessarily be assigned in twos, according to William Storey, the 
city's human resources director. Officers who volunteer for the one-officer 
units at night will be paid an extra 10%. 
</P>
<P>
* Patrol officers who volunteer for a five-day week will be paid an extra 5%, 
although new hires assigned to the five-day weeks will not receive the added 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
* The union president will continue to be released full time from police duties 
to attend to union business, but each union member will donate a few hours of 
scheduled holiday time each year to reimburse the city. 
</P>
<P>
* The city will cut its retirement contributions to new hires by about 
two-thirds, according to Storey, putting the police union in line with other 
city unions already working under a two-tiered retirement system.

PARENTS PETITION TO RETAIN KOREAN LIAISON; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE MONEY, ABC DISTRICT OFFICIALS PLAN TO REASSIGN 
THE POPULAR ADMINISTRATOR.

More than 100 Korean parents filled the ABC Unified School District board room 
this week to protest the district's plans to reassign its only Korean 
administrator, whom they say provides a crucial link between them, their 
children and the school system. 
</P>
<P>
The parents Tuesday presented school officials with petitions urging that 
Howard Kwon be retained as coordinator of special programs rather than be 
assigned to a classroom to teach. The petitions contained 350 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Kwon, 53, has been the special programs coordinator for 10 years. He is a 
liaison between immigrant parents who speak limited English, the district's 
1,600 Korean students and the school system. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the parents do not speak English," Kwon said. They do not understand 
the culture, which causes a lot of conflicts between them and their children. 
They come to me for help." Kwon said he also helps resolve conflicts between 
the Korean youths and those of other cultures in the 20,000-student district, 
which serves the cities of Cerritos, Artesia, Lakewood, Hawaiian Gardens and 
part of Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Kwon said that he will quit rather than return to the classroom to teach 
English or social studies. The reassignment also would result in a pay cut of 
about $15,000 a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
ABC school officials said Kwon's reassignment, which would take effect in the 
fall, is part of an effort to trim about $5.7 million from the ABC district 
budget over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Kwon's position is among nine that are scheduled to be eliminated or left 
vacant in 1990-91. "No one is being fired or laid off," Supt. Larry Lucas said. 
Everyone has employment." 
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledge that Kwon provides a valuable service. "He has done an 
invaluable job," said Deputy Supt. Michele Lawrence. "This has nothing to do 
with his job performance." 
</P>
<P>
She said the district will rely on four community liaisons, one of whom is 
Korean, to help with cross-cultural communication. The district also has about 
20 Korean employees, including 11 teachers, who speak Korean, Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of factors make the cutbacks necessary, Lawrence said. State funds 
have not kept up with inflation, enrollment has declined, and health care costs 
have increased. 
</P>
<P>
But parents and students said they will continue to demand that officials 
retain Kwon as an administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have problems we tell Howard. He tells us what to do. He is very 
important to us," Artesia High School student Peter Rhee said recently during a 
meeting of the Korean Students Club. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Jong Kim told school board members Tuesday: "We wish to solve this issue 
internally. But if necessary, we will take legal action to prevent the 
elimination of the postion of Korean special education coordinator."

ARMORED CAR BANDIT GIVEN 14-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old man was sentenced to 14 years in prison Tuesday after a jury 
convicted him of gunning down an armored car guard during a foiled robbery 
attempt in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
After three days of deliberation in the second trial of Alfred Giordano, a 
Pasadena Superior Court jury found him guilty of attempted robbery and 
attempted murder in the Dec. 31, 1987, shooting that left security guard Howard 
White paralyzed. But the jury rejected an allegation that the shooting was 
premeditated, thereby reducing the maximum penalty from life in prison to 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, Judge Terry Smerling issued a $100 fine and sentenced 
Giordano to the maximum 14 years, citing "the carefully planned nature of the 
robbery . . . the viciousness of the shooting . . . the racial overtones." 
</P>
<P>
White, a 34-year-old father of two who is black, was not present for the 
verdict or the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the robbery was premeditated," Smerling said as Giordano's mother 
and father looked on. "And incredibly serious injuries were suffered by Mr. 
White. It could very well have been a murder case." 
</P>
<P>
It was a quick and clear-cut ending to an unusual and sometimes bizarre court 
saga. 
</P>
<P>
Both Alfred and his brother, Peter Giordano, 33, were charged in 1988 with 
attempted murder and attempted robbery after White was shot outside a 
check-cashing service on San Fernando Road. Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Ann Glidden 
contended that Alfred, using a Uzi semiautomatic rifle, gunned down White and 
unsuccessfully searched his canvas bag for money while Peter, 33, drove the 
getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
In a trial last May, no one could identify Peter Giordano as the getaway driver 
and he was acquitted. But three witnesses said they saw Alfred Giordano shoot 
White. Kimberly Giordano, Alfred's wife, testified that he told her how he had 
committed the crime and that he laughed about White's injuries and his race. 
</P>
<P>
But Kimberly Giordano also told jurors that Officer Joseph Jimenez, the 
Glendale police investigator in the case, had sex with her and coerced her to 
testify against her husband. White, when asked to point out his assailant, 
looked at the brothers, who were sitting together, and pointed at Peter 
Giordano. When asked by the prosecutor if he was sure, White said that he had 
meant to point at Alfred Giordano and had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a mistrial was declared on the charges against Alfred Giordano 
after jurors deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of conviction. The dissenting juror, 
prosecutors have said, was swayed by the testimony of Jeanette Russell, a 
witness who said Alfred was visiting her at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Russell repeated the same testimony in the second trial, which began Feb. 15. 
But jurors said Tuesday her testimony was discounted. It was mainly the 
testimony by Kimberly Giordano that convinced them of Giordano's guilt, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During the second trial, Kimberly Giordano reluctantly corroborated much of her 
earlier testimony about her husband's confession to her. 
</P>
<P>
"We went with the three eyewitnesses, and by and large, everyone seemed to buy 
Kimberly's story," said Richard McKinney, a dialogue writer for the TV show 
"L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
"No one for an instant believed Jeanette Russell" because she did not come 
forward with the alibi until long after Alfred Giordano's arrest, McKinney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred's defense attorney, Robert Swanson, contended it was Peter Giordano, not 
Alfred, who attempted the foiled heist and shot White. During the trial, he 
called Peter Giordano into the courtroom several times, asking White and others 
if they were certain it was Alfred and not Peter who assaulted him. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were not swayed. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense brought in a lot of strategies to throw the jury off, but there 
was never any doubt," said Pamela Welsh, a teacher from Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors, however, said they thought the police investigation in the case 
had been "unprofessional" and "sloppy." They said they believed that Jimenez 
had a sexual relationship with Kimberly Giordano and set up reward payments in 
exchange for her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson said Tuesday he requested the speedy sentencing so that he can begin 
filing an appeal. He indicated he will challenge several of Smerling's rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Swanson's objections, the judge ruled in both trials that Kimberly 
Giordano be allowed to testify against her husband. Although a 1983 divorce was 
set aside last year by an Orange County court, Smerling ruled that marital 
privilege -- allowing spouses to refuse to testify against each other -- did 
not apply in the case.

PARKING BAN WOULD PAY ITS WAY; 
</P>
<P>
ORDINANCE: PERMIT FEES AND VIOLATOR FINES WOULD PRODUCE A SURPLUS OF $200,000, 
A STAFF REPORT ESTIMATES. BUT ONE OFFICIAL OBJECTS TO FINANCING THAT DEPENDS ON 
FINES. 
</P>

<P>
A proposed ban on overnight on-street parking would cost the city more than $1 
million a year to implement, but parking permit fees and violator fines would 
produce a surplus of about $200,000, according to a report reviewed this week 
by the Glendale Parking Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission -- which voted 3 to 2 last month to recommend banning on-street 
parking between 2 and 6 a.m. -- reviewed a report detailing the pros and cons 
of the ordinance Monday. Residents and guests whose vehicles display city 
permits would be exempt from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council last year asked the commission to study ways to curtail 
overnight parking problems created by the city's rapid growth, particularly in 
the southern part of Glendale. City officials have said curbs are clogged with 
cars because many apartment complexes have insufficient off-street parking and 
a high number of tenants per unit. 
</P>
<P>
City officials believe that the parking congestion leads to unsightly 
neighborhoods and traffic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The report, written by the city's traffic and transportation staff, includes 
new estimates on staffing, expenses and revenues. The report will be considered 
by the Glendale City Council in the near future, city staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of the program may be self-supporting, mainly provided by violators 
of the ordinance," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, residents would receive up to two free permits annually if no 
off-street parking spaces are available. Additional permits would cost $40 
each. A resident could obtain up to 30 daily guest permits free each year, with 
a charge imposed for additional ones. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, four customer service representatives and three 
inspectors or investigators will be needed to issue the permits. The city 
expects to provide about 31,000 permits. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Horne, Glendale's traffic and transportation administrator, said the cost 
of issuing permits is expected to be $314,000, offset by $105,000 in revenues 
from the sale of permits. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that this loss will be made up through enforcement -- motorists 
who violate the law would receive $21 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, program revenues would total about $1.3 million annually, against 
expenses of $1.1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horne cautioned, however, that "we have no way of knowing how many tickets" the 
city will issue. 
</P>
<P>
He said the revenue estimates were based on a plan according to which parking 
enforcement officers would write about 270 tickets each night. The plan calls 
for the hiring of 12 such officers, another police sergeant to supervise them 
and a clerical worker. 
</P>
<P>
If fewer people violate the law or fewer enforcement officers are hired, the 
financial picture could change, Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Michael D. Moro, who opposed the parking ban last month, said 
Monday that he objects to financing the program through violator fines. "This 
is going to be an expensive program," he said. "It seems to be not a very 
positive way of correcting the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Parking Commissioner Zaven Hanessian, who also voted against the permit 
proposal, asked that his minority report also be presented to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Hanessian proposed several steps that the city should take in place of 
the permit system: 
</P>
<P>
Through utility bill enclosures or other notices, the city should contact 
residents who are parking on the street because their landlord charges an extra 
fee for parking. City officials should then resolve this problem with the 
landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords should be prohibited from renting a garage to a non-tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who uses a garage as a workshop should be required to clear the unit so 
it can be used to store the resident's car. 
</P>
<P>
The city should build new parking lots south of Colorado Street to give 
residents an off-street location for extra vehicles. Residents would pay a 
meter or a monthly fee to use this lot. 
</P>
<P>
If residents do not comply with these plans, Hanessian said, the late-night 
parking permit proposal should then be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"We would tell the public that we tried our best to please them and to solve 
their problems, but they refused to cooperate with us," he said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Marilyne Wiechmann said Hanessian's suggestions "would be a very 
piecemeal solution." 
</P>
<P>
She said land is too expensive for the city to buy for new residential parking 
lots. Wiechmann said the council should get a chance to review Hanessian's 
alternatives, but she remained firm in her endorsement of the permit proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan we submitted has drawbacks, but I feel it's the best solution to the 
problem," she said.

<P>
Hatch, who called for Lewis' resignation after Police Chief Ken Hickman quit, 
said other council members have ignored his request for a city investigation of 
the city manager. So Hatch is hoping residents will help pressure his 
colleagues to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Tuesday outside City Hall, Hatch reiterated his demand 
that Lewis resign. 
</P>
<P>
"Our police chief should never have been allowed to go," said Hatch, who 
credited Hickman with streamlining police operations and controlling costs 
during his one year on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who has the support of at least three of the five council members, 
denied Hatch's charges: "I think those allegations are absolutely without 
foundation." Lewis became city manager in 1988, the third since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch said Lewis had undermined Hickman's authority by maintaining an "open 
back door" policy that allowed police officers to go to Lewis and win reversals 
of the chief's policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman resigned after the Monterey Park Police Officers Assn. gave him a vote 
of no confidence. One of the association's complaints was that Hickman had 
drastically reduced overtime. Overtime costs reached a high of $30,000 a month 
last year but were reduced to $6,000 a month in January, Capt. Dan Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch accused Lewis of telling his staff to conceal mounting overtime costs and 
shortfalls in projected city revenues. He charged that there is a $300,000 
deficit in the city's budget of $30.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Bell, Monterey Park director of management services, denied that a 
deficit exists. She said officials expect the city to be in the black by June, 
the end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hatch was critical of Lewis' decision to appoint former police 
Chief Robert Collins as interim chief, even though he has retired and is 
receiving disability benefits for a heart condition. Hatch said bringing back 
Collins could create additional worker compensation liabilities for the city if 
he experiences further medical problems while filling in as chief. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lost total faith in our city manager," said Hatch, adding that he will 
try to gain support for Lewis' ouster as he campaigns door-to-door for 
reelection to the council. In the April 10 election, he is among six candidates 
vying for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
Already, he said, a unspecified number of residents plan to press for Lewis' 
resignation at council candidates' forums and at Monday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Patricia Reichenberger scoffed at Hatch's accusations and defended Lewis 
as a good manager who keeps the council informed of financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark has always been direct with us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Hatch's charges, Lewis said he keeps an open door for city 
employees so they have "the opportunity to talk with the city manager about 
things that really bother them." On the police officers' dispute with Hickman, 
Lewis said he did not intervene until the matter got out of control. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the city's financial situation, Lewis said he never instructed 
staff members to hide information from the council. Bell said revenues from 
some new municipal fees are lower than anticipated but said there is no 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard Mark say not to tell the council," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
And as for the appointment of Collins, Lewis said doctors have determined that 
the retired chief is medically fit to work. He said attorneys have assured him 
that appointing Collins as interim chief will not lead to workers' compensation 
problems.

EX-UNION OFFICIAL INDICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pearl Jennings, 49, of Pomona, former secretary-treasurer of a union that 
represents workers at the Libbey Glass plant in the City of Industry, has been 
charged with embezzling more than $57,000 in union funds, the U.S. Department 
of Labor announced. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings, who resigned her office in Flint Glass Workers Union Local 705 last 
year, was indicted by a federal grand jury and arraigned Monday in federal 
court in Los Angeles. She pleaded not guilty. Jennings was charged under a law 
that makes embezzlement of union funds punishable by up to five years in 
prison, a $10,000 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment follows an investigation by the Labor Department's office of 
labor-management standards. Attempts to reach Jennings were unsuccessful.

GANESHA BLVD. RENAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted Monday to bestow the name "Fairplex Drive" on Ganesha 
Boulevard and parts of McKinley Avenue and E Street to give increased 
recognition to Fairplex, the site of the Los Angeles County Fair and other 
expositions. 
</P>
<P>
Fairplex Drive will become the designation for the full length of Ganesha, from 
Route 71 north to McKinley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Also redesignated as Fairplex Drive will be the portion of McKinley west of 
Ganesha Boulevard, and E Street from McKinley north to the city limits. The 
portions of McKinley and E Street that are being renamed are along the 
perimeter of the Fairplex property. 
</P>
<P>
The change will require the state to replace the Ganesha off-ramp signs on the 
San Bernardino Freeway. Robert DeLoach, city public works director, said the 
name change will take effect after the state Department of Transportation 
authorizes and makes the new freeway signs, which could take as long as nine 
months. He said the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. will pay the cost of the sign 
changes, estimated at $13,000 for the freeway and $3,000 for city streets.

LEASE NEGOTIATOR BECOMES TEMPORARY PORT MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach Harbor Commission has named its former top lease negotiator to 
temporarily head the Port of Long Beach, one of the most profitable ports in 
the country, which has been without a permanent chief for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
Steven R. Dillenbeck, managing director of commerce and development, will move 
into the top spot for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
The job pays $103,400 and oversees a $220-million budget, making the 
self-supporting port one of the community's wealthiest components. 
</P>
<P>
After two management shake-ups, the Harbor Commission decided last May to 
rotate its three managing directors into the executive's chair, rather than 
appoint a permanent chief. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Brown, who oversees administration and maintenance, first held the job. 
Leland R. Hill, director of planning and engineering, is scheduled to take over 
after Dillenbeck. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, harbor commissioners will decide whether to continue the 
rotation, name one of the three men to the job permanently or look outside the 
port for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement has been criticized by some as bad business, but the port seems 
to have flourished nevertheless. It is the largest cargo handler on the West 
Coast and, combined with the Port of Los Angeles, is the biggest harbor complex 
in the country.

<P>
Project DAY, a 15-year-old social service agency for youths, received approval 
Tuesday from the Board of Directors to revamp city-owned Fire Station 36 at 
1435 N. Raymond Ave. and convert it to a youth social service center. When 
completed, the center will have 5,500 square feet of office and recreational 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The agency plans to apply to the California Youth Authority on Tuesday for $1 
million in state funds from a pool of $35 million available statewide. If 
Project DAY, which stands for Diversion Alternatives for Youth, receives the 
money, it will pay rent of $1 annually to the city, will assume all maintenance 
and utility costs for the building, and will seek other social service agencies 
to rent in the building.

DRUGS AND SCHOOLS: THE PERSPECTIVE OF 1 STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days drugs are being bought and sold each day in schools, on the street 
and even at public places. It is up to us to keep drugs off of our streets, and 
our children. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs have been a major problem to us. We are losing innocent people each day. 
We all have to teach our children not to use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In schools they are now having undercover cops to make sure everything is under 
control and there are no drug dealers selling drugs to students. More students 
are dropping out of school these days. Students say school is a joke, and they 
say who needs education. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush should not give any aid to these countries who support drug 
leaders. Anyone who gets caught selling or buying drugs should be locked up in 
prison for at least a (minimum) of two years, because we don't need anyone who 
takes drugs in this world. 
</P>
<P>
I made a commitment to myself to never use drugs or even touch them, because I 
know what they can do to you. This is an anti-drug message for the people all 
around the world. Be smart, don't start. 
</P>
<P>
And for the students in school here is one for you. Be cool, stay in school. 
And our world will be a better, peaceful place for us if we just give a hand. 
We all can help out in this drug problem that we now live in. Please help our 
society and our children.

HEALTH CENTER TO CLOSE

<P>
The Alhambra Health Center, a free county facility that treats communicable 
diseases and provides immunization shots, will close until a new 
earthquake-safe building can be found to house it, a county official said. 
</P>
<P>
The center, at 612 W. Shorb St., is in an unreinforced brick building that 
structural engineers said would be unsafe during a moderate to severe 
earthquake, said William Weitekamp, administrator of Los Angeles County's San 
Gabriel Valley Health Centers Network. 
</P>
<P>
Until a new facility can be found, patients and clinic workers will be 
transferred to other network clinics located in communities such as Monrovia, 
Azusa, La Puente and El Monte, Weitekamp said.

MONTEREY PARK POLICE -- 'MERIT TAKES A BACK SEAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Monterey Park Police Department is corrupted by a terminal belly cancer of 
internal politics. According to reports that I have received over the years, it 
is a department where merit always takes a back seat to political connections. 
</P>
<P>
I think this is why the Monterey Park Police Officers Assn. gave a unanimous 
"no confidence" vote to former police Chief Kenneth Hickman, who made it a 
point to avoid being political. 
</P>
<P>
If Wes Clair, president of the association, thinks he could do a better job in 
running the department, he should apply for the job of chief -- if he's 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
I think that he and his fellow police officers are more concerned with serving 
their own interests than with protecting the residents of Monterey Park, which 
is what they are hired to do. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of political policemen have used the Police Department and the 
residents of Monterey Park for far too long. It's time for a change.

CHURCH EXPANSION DENIED WHEN NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Heeding the complaints of residents, the Norwalk City Council on Tuesday 
rejected a proposal to expand the Dong Shin Presbyterian Church on Kenney 
Street in the northwest corner of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The church had purchased two neighboring houses, which it wanted to use for 
Sunday school classes and parking. 
</P>
<P>
But several residents objected to the expansion because it would bring more 
traffic into the residential neighborhood. Residents complained that 
churchgoers monopolize the curb parking on Kenney Street each Sunday, and that 
they often park illegally.

MANAGER PLAN REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Downtown merchants voted 55 to 33 against a plan to hire a professional manager 
to promote downtown businesses, even though city officials had offered to pay 
part of the manager's salary. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, announced Friday, came as a disappointment to board members of the 
Monrovia Downtown Merchants Assn., who were promoting the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Stewart, president of the association, said the board has tabled the 
proposal indefinitely because so many members voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
"When they see it's going to cost them money, that's the only thing they think 
about," said board member Detro Sells. "The board is quite concerned about not 
having time to do the things a downtown manager would be able to do for us." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven business owners quit the 197-member city-financed association 
earlier this month in protest of proposed assessment increases to pay for a 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Salary and overhead for a downtown manager would have cost up to $50,000 
annually. The Monrovia Redevelopment Agency had offered to partially subsidize 
the expense for the first five years. After that, merchants would have been 
charged an additional $300 annually.

POLICE LIEUTENANT PROMOTED

<TEXT>
<P>
Police Lt. Dan Cross, a 16-year veteran of the department, has been promoted to 
captain, filling a vacancy created when former Capt. Joseph Santoro left to 
become Monrovia police chief last fall. 
</P>
<P>
A controversy over the selection process and qualifications for a new captain 
had pitted former police Chief Ken Hickman against the city's personnel board. 
</P>
<P>
The board said Hickman, who recommended that a captain have a college degree 
and at least three years of management experience, told them there would not be 
enough in-house candidates eligible for the position. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman said that, according to city rules, in-house searches require at least 
six eligible candidates. He said that if the board adopted his recommended job 
criteria, which it did, there would not be the necessary number of in-house 
candidates. Therefore, he asked that the job be opened to outside applicants. 
The dispute triggered a series of events that led to Hickman's resignation last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people, including 12 in-house candidates, applied for the position. 
Cross, who began his duties as captain last Tuesday, has four years of 
management experience and has a bachelor's degree in criminology and a master's 
degree in public administration.

OIL STANCE MAY HURT ROHRABACHER; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST-TERM CONGRESSMAN'S ADVOCACY OF 
OFFSHORE DRILLING IS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT THEY CAN TURN TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after the tanker American Trader began hemorrhaging off Huntington 
Beach, U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher appeared at the oil spill scene and said the 
accident underscored the need for more offshore oil drilling in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched it on TV," said Republican Bob Ryan, a member of the Rancho Palos 
Verdes City Council. "I thought, 'No, Dana, stay out of this, this is not the 
time to discuss that issue.' " 
</P>
<P>
Democrats working to dislodge Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) from his 42nd 
Congressional District seat hope Ryan's fears are well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a district in which Republicans hold a decisive 53% share of 
registered voters, Democrats are trying to turn public concern about oil spills 
-- and Rohrabacher's advocacy of offshore drilling -- to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wedge issue," said Steve Beale, a Democratic organizer in Torrance. 
"It's the kind of issue that can set Republicans against Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
GOP strategists say the Democrats are clutching at straws. Steve Johnson, 
director of the Los Angeles County GOP, said: "When the Democrats park their 
cars and walk, maybe they'll have an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, a former Reagan speech writer elected to Congress in 1988, does 
not support offshore drilling across the board. He says he opposes sinking new 
wells within sight of shore in areas that have not yet had any drilling, unless 
the affected coastal communities support it. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, however, he is working on a bill that would require the federal 
government to share royalties from new offshore oil production with the 
nation's coastal cities affected by the drilling. 
</P>
<P>
He clearly hopes that such a measure would soften opposition to drilling in his 
largely coastal district that snakes south from Torrance and the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula all the way to Huntington Beach. So far the local response has been 
hostile, however. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher argues that extracting crude with oil platforms and piping it 
ashore is sounder strategically and safer environmentally than receiving it 
from distant states or foreign countries by ship. 
</P>
<P>
He points to the safety record of oil platforms in his district off Long Beach, 
Seal Beach and Huntington Beach. "A few gallons here, a few gallons there, 
(but) there has never been a spill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Rohrabacher, who does not have a primary opponent, says he doubts that his 
position will hurt him in the Nov. 6 general election. "It's totally 
defensible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats say Rohrabacher's drilling advocacy could hurt him more than he 
thinks, particularly in light of events that might give Californians reason to 
fear oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent, of course, was last month's 394,000-gallon American Trader 
spill, which killed more than 700 birds and closed 20 miles of Orange County 
beaches, many of them for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats also point to the Bush Administration's consideration of a plan to 
sell federal drilling leases in three offshore areas believed to be rich in oil 
and gas: Lease Sale 95 off the Southern California coast, Lease Sale 91 off 
Northern California and Lease Sale 116 off Southwest Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Lease Sale 95 would encompass 6.7 million acres of ocean bottom stretching from 
the Mexican border to the northern border of San Luis Obispo County. Lease Sale 
91 would cover 1.1 million acres off Mendocino and Humboldt counties. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest campaign mailer, Democrat challenger Guy Kimbrough juxtaposed his 
own public statements in opposition to Lease Sale 95 with the pro-drilling 
comments Rohrabacher made to reporters last month at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough, a political-science instructor, thinks Rohrabacher's support for oil 
drilling can be tied to his anti-abortion activism as proof that the 
congressman, formerly a Libertarian, is out of step with the GOP rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
The two other Democrats in the race agree. Like Kimbrough, Jim Cavuoto, the 
owner of a small publishing business in Torrance, and Bryan Stevens, former 
president of the California Teachers Assn., oppose offshore drilling and 
government prohibitions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Rohrabacher's views don't fit in with those of the average Republican voter 
sitting at home," Cavuoto said. "If Republicans can see the clear alternative, 
and that's our challenge, I believe that in this race, in this district and in 
this year, many Republican voters will vote for a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
Republican politicians have a range of opinions on whether Cavuoto's analysis 
is correct. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes City Councilman John McTaggart said that on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, Republicans are extremely concerned about Rohrabacher's stand 
on oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important issue. Here, we have conservative people who are 
environmentally minded," McTaggart said. "I've got to tell you, I think (GOP 
strategists) are wrong if they don't think this is an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Walker, a Torrance City Council member, disagrees: "Republicans aren't 
going to vote for a Democrat because of any single issue."

ALL'S NOT WELL WITH MONROVIA'S WATER AS POLLUTANT LEVEL RISES 
</P>

MONROVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discovery of contamination in two city wells could double residents' water 
bills unless rain falls soon to reduce the pollution, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Tests showing rising levels of trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, in the 
wells came as a blow to city water managers, who have been combining water from 
the two wells with contaminated water from Monrovia's three other wells to 
produce a safe, drinkable blend. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, concerned by contamination levels in 
the two wells noted late last year, agreed Monday to dispatch a regional water 
investigator to examine the wells, located at Myrtle and California avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Although the current TCE levels in the wells -- measured at 2.6 parts per 
billion -- are allowable under state standards, they may soon become too high 
for blending, which could force the city to purchase large quantities of clean 
water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The city currently draws about 9,000 acre feet of water from its wells each 
year. It would have to purchase an equivalent amount from the water district if 
the well contamination increases, as is expected unless rainfall dilutes the 
water supply, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Main San Gabriel Basin has been on the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency's Superfund list since 1985, with cleanup costs estimated at $800 
million. Investigators believe that a massive underground plume of 
contamination is moving southward through the valley toward Whittier Narrows at 
a rate of one mile every five years. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia now spends $108 per acre foot -- about 326,000 gallons -- to pump and 
deliver its water to 8,500 customers. MWD water costs $233 an acre foot, said 
Paul Smith, Monrovia's utilities division manager. 
</P>
<P>
A household consuming 1,500 cubic feet of water -- 11,250 gallons -- per month 
pays about $15, Smith said. If the city has to buy water, the monthly bill per 
household would increase to about $30. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative would be to build a $1-million treatment facility, an 
option that the city put off two years ago because regional water authorities 
believed then that the plume of contamination was migrating from the area, 
Public Works Director Bob Sandwick said. The city also had reservations about 
the cost of constructing the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The investigator from the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board's 
toxics division, which works with the EPA, will team up with city staff members 
within a month to examine possible sources of contamination within half a mile 
radius of the wells. An electronics firm, a former landfill and homes are 
located nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Yacoub, director of the water board's toxics division, said it is unclear 
why the Monrovia levels are rising at this time. "Monrovia is at the boundary 
of the contamination plume," he said. "If this thing goes way up, there's got 
to be a (contamination) source. If it stays marginal, (the wells' pumps) could 
be pulling regional ground water in." 
</P>
<P>
He said the pollution levels are heightened because the state is entering its 
fourth year of drought. The ground water level beneath the city dropped 50 feet 
from its 1984 level, he said, increasing the concentration of contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bob Bartlett said he is not too concerned about the contamination because 
Monrovia has ready access to Metropolitan Water District water if the city's 
wells become unusable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to cost us more money, but we'll do whatever we need to protect the 
people," he said. The contamination levels are "something we want to watch and 
stay on top of." 
</P>
<P>
The maximum TCE concentration allowed under state Health Services Department 
regulations is five parts per billion. At that level, there is a risk that one 
in a million people would develop cancer as a result of drinking the water over 
a 70-year period, Yacoub said. He added that the standard is "extremely 
conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Van Buskirk, president of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund 
Working/Information Group, a citizens watchdog association, agreed. "We 
recognize there are safe limits," said Van Buskirk, a Monrovia resident. He 
noted, however, that the latest contamination discovery at the two wells 
underscores the group's complaints that cleanup efforts are moving too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have known about pollution in Monrovia's other three wells -- 
located at Myrtle and Longden avenues -- since 1981, said Tony Zampiello, the 
city's utility production supervisor. Most recent testing of those wells shows 
TCE levels ranging from 2.5 to 5.6 parts per billion, while concentrations at 
the two cleaner wells have been negligible until recently, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The city recorded a high of 2.4 parts per billion in its weekly tests of the 
two wells in January, 1989, but levels plummeted to 0.3 after heavy rain in 
February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The level began climbing again last fall and reached 2.6 in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't dropped since," Smith said.

ALPHA BETA SUES CITY OVER CARTS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: GLENDALE WANTS $15 EACH FOR MORE THAN 200 STRAY CARTS, A CHARGE THE 
MARKET CALLS 'EXTORTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A local grocery store has filed a $75,000 lawsuit against the city of Glendale, 
charging that an ordinance allowing the city to confiscate stray shopping carts 
and charge grocers to get them back is "extortion." 
</P>
<P>
The suit by Alpha Beta, 1122 E. Broadway, was filed last Thursday in Glendale 
Superior Court. It claims that the city unlawfully seized more than 200 carts 
that had been taken from the store's lots and left on public property and has 
refused to return them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tantamount to having your car stolen, then going to the impound yard and 
being told, "OK, you've got to pay a special fee to get your car back,' " said 
Mark Geragos, an attorney representing Alpha Beta. "When your property is taken 
away from you, you shouldn't have to pay to get it back. In any other 
situation, that's called extortion. It's punishing the victim." 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, the City Council, frustrated by a growing number of carts 
abandoned on streets, sidewalks, parks and other public areas, passed an 
ordinance authorizing the city to collect the carts and charge grocers $15 each 
for their return. 
</P>
<P>
But a year later, after more than 800 stray carts were rounded up and kept at a 
public works yard, council members adopted an ordinance that exempted groceries 
from the $15 per-cart charge if they agreed to install electronic cart-control 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
Several stores, including Alpha Beta, agreed to use the device, which would 
automatically lock the wheels of shopping carts taken off the stores' property. 
</P>
<P>
Vons, Lucky Stores and Ralphs then picked up, at no charge, hundreds of their 
carts that had been kept at the yard, said Albert Lee, a maintenance supervisor 
at the yard. 
</P>
<P>
But the device, called Kart Kontrol, failed to work, leaving city officials 
searching earlier this month for a new system. 
</P>
<P>
Geragos said last week that Alpha Beta has considered other cart-control 
systems but that they are costly to install. He said the grocery may not pursue 
the lawsuit if the store's carts are returned without charge. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have estimated the carts are worth about $100 apiece. But 
Geragos said a cart costs about $400. He contended that the city damaged Alpha 
Beta's carts when it stored them and should reimburse the grocery for the time 
and money it has lost trying to retrieve the carts. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Cruz, a city administrative assistant who oversees collection of the carts, 
was not available for comment. But City Atty. Scott Howard said the ordinance 
authorizing the collection "is lawful, appropriate and constitutional." 
</P>
<P>
"These carts are a hazard and they're a nuisance," Howard said. "The courts 
generally hold that where you have the type of business that's going to 
contribute to the problem, you have an obligation to cure the problem. It's the 
market's responsibility to ensure that these carts don't get scattered around 
the streets."

FIDDLE PLAYING MAKES RAINDOGS A BAND APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raindogs are this week's killer guitar band with possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is this Boston band tighter than your boss, but their songs are full 
of insightful lyrics and have more hooks than "Peter Pan," not to mention a 
scene-stealing fiddle player, Johnny Cunningham. With a just-released debut 
album, "Lost Souls," the Raindogs will play the Ventura Theatre on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
And just as every musician that ever played has come back or won't go away, 
every band -- pretty much -- comes from some other band. The Raindogs come from 
plenty of other bands. 
</P>
<P>
Triple-threat guitarist/singer/songwriter Mark Cutler was the leader of those 
Rhode Island rockers that never quite made the big time, the Schemers. Second 
guitarist Emerson Torrey, also from the Schemers, has been playing with Cutler 
for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The bass player, Darren Hill, used to be in the Red Rockers, who had a hit with 
the catchy "China" back in 1983. Hill, from Louisiana, brings a folksy Cajun 
influence to the band. Drummer Jimmy Reilly, from Belfast, used to be in the 
influential punk/pop group Stiff Little Fingers and later the Red Rockers. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, from Edinburgh, Scotland, is a fiddle virtuoso, who played for the 
Scottish National Orchestra when he was just 11. Later he founded Silly Wizard, 
a critically acclaimed folk group. When Cutler, Torrey and Cunningham get it 
going on some of the Raindogs' rockers -- such as "May Your Heart Keep Beating" 
and "Under the Rainbow" -- they create a sound that is as different as it is 
accessible, sort of, but not like Big Country or the Jesus and Mary Chain. But 
it's Cunningham's fiddle playing that sets the Raindogs apart from those other 
ten zillion roots-rhythm-and-booze-bar-bands of your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
And Cutler is a clever songwriter, specializing in the timeless love lost/love 
lousy school of deadpan sniveling with a great beat. 
</P>
<P>
And how's this for a grab-your-umbrella Dream Concert: The Raindogs, the 
Rainmakers, the Raindrops and Rain Parade? Not this time -- the Raindogs will 
be opening for one of the wittiest writers in rock, the outrageous Warren 
Zevon. He's touring in a thinly veiled effort to sell copies of his latest 
record, "Transverse City." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, need a BMW? Doesn't everyone? Just go to any rock concert -- they're 
giving them away. In addition to wreaking serious damage to your ears with loud 
music, there's also serious damage to your wallet what with twenty-buck 
tickets, twenty-buck T-shirts, three bucks for a draft beer, and continuing 
education, in which security everywhere teaches Rude 101. Oh, and those BMWs -- 
that's "basic monotonous wait," as in what happens between acts. 
</P>
<P>
That's when you actually have to talk to your date, try to get a drink from a 
bartender, waste your few good years in line at the bathroom, all the while 
listening to the world's worst tape that every venue inevitably inflicts upon 
its patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestion: I realize this is stupid, but why can't bands follow each other, 
say, five minutes apart? It's the '90s -- the technology is there. Or at least, 
why not play a tape of the upcoming band? Or maybe show vintage Warner Bros. 
cartoons, maybe an episode of "Married . . . With Children." Yeah, right, get 
back in line. 
</P>
<P>

NEST OF OJAI'S ITALIAN CUISINE MIXES ELEGANCE AND EARTHINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning, the Nest of Ojai was exactly what you'd expect from the name: 
a cozy little sandwich shop across the street from the Ojai Museum. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of passing through several owners, it has evolved into the very 
epitome of Ojai-style coziness. There's a skylight in the corrugated roof and 
lots of tasteful woodwork against the light-colored walls, particularly in the 
bar. The sound track is soothing, static New Age music exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
The Nest still has some sandwiches at lunchtime, but the menu has become much 
more ambitious. The current chef is Aldo Saad, formerly chef at a number of Los 
Angeles and Beverly Hills restaurants, and he specializes in Northern Italian 
food, though with tendencies toward both elegant nouvelle cuisine and earthy 
peasant cooking. And here and there, as if in a gesture of coziness, he 
includes dishes that might be American, if we could be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
On the elegant side is the ultra-modern array of vegetables that accompanies 
most entrees: baby carrots, baby white carrots, squash blossoms, terrifically 
fresh green beans, pale-fried chunks of potato the size of marbles, a lozenge 
of puffy corn polenta. The entree might be something like ahi tuna in a pool of 
sharp lime butter sauce with a little star pattern of kiwi puree painted on it, 
or very tender Santa Barbara abalone with shiitake mushrooms and butter. 
</P>
<P>
On the earthy side is pappardelle con anatra: a plate piled high with broad 
noodles, chunks of duck, thick duck gravy, spinach and lentils. This is a 
heavy, meaty dish, though the effect is lightened a little by a couple of 
radicchio leaves scattered around like red-purple arrows pointing out of the 
brown and green hill of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
The sandwiches at lunch are American, of course. Oddly, at dinner the veal in 
brown butter sauce seems American too, a sort of veal cutlet with excellent 
crunchy breading. It is topped with what is, in effect, a tomato and exotic 
lettuce salad, as if the nation's most elegant truck stop served its salads on 
top of the entrees. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, we have orthodox Northern Italian food: say, fettuccine in 
cream sauce with peas and strong, salty ham, or lobster ravioli in butter 
(well, there's a little French-style tarragon in there too). Of course, there's 
a thoroughly Spanish paella lurking around, the rice mixed with fish, clams, 
mussels and cumin-heavy homemade sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, when the Nest serves osso buco, it's not as orthodox as it 
might be. Instead of the usual creamy risotto, the veal shank comes with a mold 
of saffron rice spotted with peas and bits of sweet pepper. The shank is served 
whole, too, rather than cut into segments. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list is rather short, but it includes a rugged bresaola salad 
full of chunks of artichoke heart and lots of shaved Parmesan, as well as 
slivers of dried beef among the lettuces. The only weakness among the 
appetizers is the eggplant. The thin slices folded with tomato sauce and melted 
cheese seem too simple and unassuming for an appetizer, as if they belonged 
among the side dishes along with the baby vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
There's a model of a creme brulee at dessert time, creamy and with a real burnt 
caramel flavor in the crust. The Nest also makes its own gelati (best: white 
pistachio). When the Nest makes tirami su, the ladyfingers are mixed not only 
with mascarpone cheese and cream but, as the menu boasts, Bailey's Irish Cream. 
Fittingly, it's a downright cozy variation. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEST OF OJAI 
</P>
<P>
108 S. Montgomery St., Ojai. (805) 646-8111. Open for lunch Tuesday through 
Saturday, for dinner Tuesday through Sunday; Sunday brunch. Full bar. Parking 
lot. American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only,

ELECTION '90 DIAMOND BAR;

ANONYMOUS FLYERS HEAT UP COUNCIL RACE

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black-and-white flyer exhorting readers to "Join the Frank Hill Paul Horcher 
Team" and vote against an incumbent City Council candidate caused tempers to 
flare at a recent candidates forum. 
</P>
<P>
The flyer, anonymously circulated before a forum Monday night in the Diamond 
Bar branch of the Los Angeles County Public Library, attacks Councilman Gary 
Werner and endorses candidates Cleve Holifield and Garry Stitt. Voters will 
decide April 10 among nine candidates for three seats on the council. 
</P>
<P>
While no one claimed responsibility for the flyer, some were quick to point 
fingers at each other. Although none of the candidates raised the issue 
publicly at the forum, several confrontations took place during an intermission 
and after the event. 
</P>
<P>
Werner, who found a stack of them on a table where other candidates had 
displayed campaign literature, accused Mayor Phyllis Papen of distributing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
After the event, Werner said he believed Papen, who is not up for reelection, 
was retaliating against him because he refused to support her for a second 
one-year term as mayor. The mayor is chosen each year by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't support her. She said, well then, she won't be supporting me," 
Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
Papen denies responsibility for the flyer. "I did ask for his support and he 
did turn me down (but) that has nothing to do with anything else." Papen said 
Friday she is endorsing Councilman John Forbing and candidate Jay Kim, but is 
not supporting a third candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Werner) last night I had nothing to do with it," she said Tuesday 
afternoon. "It is frustrating that people can make accusations without any 
evidence. Where's the beef? Where's the proof?" 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Forbing and Councilman Gary Miller said Monday night that Councilman 
Paul Horcher may be the culprit. On Tuesday, Papen concurred. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher was ousted as mayor pro tem in February after a falling-out with 
Miller, who at the time was running for a state Senate seat against Assemblyman 
Frank Hill (R-Whittier). Horcher is a long-time ally of Hill and is running for 
Hill's assembly seat. Hill has not endorsed a candidate in the council race. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul said he'd get back at us," Papen said. "He vowed to replace the 
incumbents." At the Feb. 6 meeting when he was removed from the post of mayor 
pro tem, Horcher urged members of the audience to "sweep them all from power." 
</P>
<P>
But Horcher denied the charge: "I didn't have anything to do with it, directly 
or indirectly." 
</P>
<P>
The flyer criticizes positions Werner has taken on issues such as waste 
treatment, traffic, business signs and the proposal for a University of 
California campus in Diamond Bar. It states, "Diamond Bar can't afford four 
more years of Gary Werner" and is attributed to the Diamond Bar Voters to Elect 
Cleve Holifield and Garry Stitt, which is not a registered group at City Hall, 
according to Deputy City Clerk Tommye Nice. 
</P>
<P>
Stitt and Holifield, who are both endorsed by Horcher, said they know nothing 
about the source of the flyer. Other candidates in the race are Gregory 
Gaffney, Thomas Ortiz, Jim Paul and Bryan Thomas.

ANN CONWAY: LIVELY MODEL, VIVID JACKETS BRIGHTEN BENEFIT

Forget the fuss over the lambada, the shocking dance craze that has staid folk 
abandoning local dance floors. 
</P>
<P>
"Vogue-ing," the passion of New York's female impersonators, came to South 
Coast Plaza on Saturday night and blew the usually wide-open minds of Newport 
Harbor Art Museum supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Now, mind you, few in this stunned social herd knew anything about vogue-ing 
when Lypsinka -- the New York female impersonator whose following includes 
Elton John and Joan Rivers -- swept off a rolling escalator and began to strut 
his sinewy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But, before they could say "the smelling salts, please!" he taught them all 
about it. Bounding before them in a fringed, black lace corset, he stopped 
here, there, and everywhere, striking haute and arty poses right out of Vogue 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Apple action occurred thanks to Barneys New York, the store that 
regularly gives its customers doses of "the unexpected, the interesting," said 
Simon Doonan, Barneys vice president and creative director. 
</P>
<P>
It was Doonan who got Lypsinka, a.k.a. John Epperson, to model some of the 45 
decorated denim jackets that, upon auction, brought $26,000 to museum coffers. 
Epperson is the rehearsal pianist for American Ballet Theatre, which on Sunday 
ended its run at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. "When I learned ABT 
was going to be in town, I asked my old friend, John, to model for us," said 
Doonan, who returned to New York on Wednesday. "He has a Los Angeles show under 
negotiation at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
To set the stage for the action-auction, Doonan took an unfinished wing of the 
new Barneys and crammed it with gilt-drenched chairs. Sparkling crystals and 
hot spotlights danced over guests' heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess when the crowd saw they were going to sit on gold chairs in a 
construction site, they knew they were in for an unorthodox evening," Doonan 
said. Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were participating artists and designers (decorators of the denim 
jackets) who included Peter Cohen, Margaret Coy, Janice Lowry, Brian Gray, Greg 
Miller, Marc Pally, Aubrey Robin and Meryl Waitz. Also on the arty scene: Henry 
and Renee Segerstrom (looking ultravogue in black leather shot with gold studs) 
and Holly and Robert Pressman of the Pressman family, owners of Barneys. 
Members of the benefit committee included Kathy Bryant, Mary Carrington, 
Beverly Diamond, Roberta Dauderman, Linda Giannini, Barbara Glabman, Deborah 
Polonsky, Susan Porter, Lorie Dewhirst Porter, Judy Slutzky, Elizabeth Tierney, 
Helen Zeughauser and Madeline Zuckerman.

Top o' the Mornin': They did it again. Bob and Cleva Howard staged Orange 
County's most popular St. Patrick's Day Irish coffee and brunch last week when 
they welcomed supporters of the Discovery Museum into their waterfront home in 
Newport Beach. Guests gathered for fresh strawberries, spinach quiche, Irish 
soda bread and steaming hot Irish coffee brimming with dollops of whipped 
cream. Proceeds will be used to benefit the museum's educational tour programs 
for local schoolchildren. The hands-on tours of the museum's restored 1898 
Kellogg House enhance the social curriculum of third- and fourth-graders. 
During the 1989-90 school year, more than 20,000 children visited the museum. 
Among guests were Junie Chong, Nora Jorgensen, Mary Lou Hornsby, Sandie and Dr. 
Gerald Brodie and Ann and Russ Pange. Honorary committee members included Betty 
Hutton Williams, Ann Mound, Emma Jane Riley, Lois Aldrin, Dot Clock and 
Catherine Thyen.

HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: ODDBALL DIET ROLLER COASTER IS BOUND TO CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
So you want to drop some of that excess baggage, eh? 
</P>
<P>
Have I got a diet plan for you. We'll call it the Odd Diet. On odd-numbered 
days, eat only foods with the letter e in their names. And on even-numbered 
days, you can eat whatever you want, as long as it doesn't have the letter e in 
its name. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on e days, eat only between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. On the other 
days, eat only between 4 and 8 p.m. The rest of the time, you can drink all the 
caffeine-free diet root beer you want, but nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and exercise is important, so you will need to spend exactly 78 minutes 
each day standing on one foot. That would be the left foot on e days, the right 
foot on the rest. In only four days, you'll start seeing results. My neighbor's 
cousin's mother-in-law, I think it was, tried it and lost 50 pounds in only a 
week. Or was it a month? 
</P>
<P>
WARNING: The preceding paragraph was for illustration purposes only. Don't try 
this at home! The Odd Diet doesn't really exist. And neither does my neighbor's 
cousin's mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are plenty of other crazy diets out there that are all too 
real. And you can lose weight on many of them, at least for a short while. But 
because they aren't balanced, healthy programs that can be translated into 
day-to-day eating habits later on, these diets are most likely to backfire, 
ultimately leaving you heavier than you were when you started. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Connie Rowland of Fountain Valley or Linda Hawkins of Placentia. They're 
success stories now, all active in Weight Watchers. But for most of their 
lives, they were passengers on the oddball diet roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a weight problem all my life," says Rowland, 32. "I grew up in a big 
family, and if Mom brought home Twinkies or something, we'd eat them fast 
because we knew that if you don't eat it now, you won't get your share." 
</P>
<P>
Rowland's mother put her on a diet when she was about 9 years old, "but it 
didn't really work. She'd pack my lunch with sandwiches made with that skinny 
bread, with cottage cheese in the middle. It was awful." 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Rowland went on an ice cream and soda diet. "I would eat two 
diet ice creams, and drink diet Dr Pepper all day long. I lost 42 pounds, but I 
put it back on immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Then she tried the stewed-tomato-and-hard-boiled-egg diet, living on those two 
foods and nothing else for weeks. "I lost 35 pounds, but then I put on 50," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it was the high-protein, low-carbohydrate Scarsdale diet, which 
promised losses of up to 20 pounds in two weeks. Rowland lost, then gained. The 
same thing happened with the Beverly Hills diet, the Cambridge diet and the 
rotation diet, "which is where you eat certain foods at certain times of the 
day, and you can't combine certain foods." 
</P>
<P>
Then she went on to the grapefruit diet, followed by the Army training diet, 
and the extremely low-fat Pritikin diet ("But I never cut out all the fat"). 
"Some worked; some didn't," she says. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she went to a nutritionist for help 2 1/2 years ago, Rowland, 5 
feet, 7 inches tall, was up to 232 pounds. "She told me that when you're 
motivated, any diet will work. I really believe that, even though I'm a strong 
believer in Weight Watchers," Rowland says. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the group's "Inner Circle" plan, Rowland lost 95 pounds over a 
year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The trick, says Linda Hawkins, 33, is to stop thinking of diets as temporary. 
But when she started Weight Watchers two years ago, that's exactly how she saw 
it. "I only joined to lose 30 pounds," she says. "Then I was going to quit." 
</P>
<P>
That was 95 pounds ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me, 'you've got to change your life style,' and I always hated that. 
It was too frightening because I didn't know what my life style was." 
</P>
<P>
From the time she was in fourth grade, Hawkins dieted frequently, but always 
with a short-term goal in mind. "I did it when I wanted to look good for 
something: a wedding, a dance," she says. "I didn't think I could stay with it 
for longer than a few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
In high school, the 250-pound teen-ager bought a book featuring 40 different 
diets. She tried most of them. "One of the weirdest was the milk and banana 
diet. I chose that because the book said you'd lose weight the fastest. For two 
days, you had nothing but bananas and milk: four bananas and a half-gallon of 
milk per day. Then on the other days, you had cottage cheese, lean meat and a 
Fresca (a diet soda), and a large salad with a small chicken wing for dinner. I 
lost a lot, but I binged terribly after that." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins studied to be an actress in college, but by the time she got her 
degree, she was too large to be considered for most roles. So she became a 
large-size model instead. Only when her agent told her she had become too heavy 
even for that did she realize that maybe her life style did need changing. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to start a big campaign, sending out pictures and everything, to 
get me jobs," she says. After the first 30 pounds came off, her agent launched 
the push as planned. But Hawkins kept losing, and soon she wasn't large enough 
for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Now that she's down to 147, with seven pounds yet to go, Hawkins has found a 
substitute for her modeling career. On April 6, she opens in the Long Beach 
Community Playhouse production of "The Mouse Trap." She plays Molly, the 
ingenue. 
</P>

E. EUROPE ARRESTS THE POLICE STATE; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNISM IS GONE, BUT THE HUGE SECURITY FORCES IT SPAWNED REMAIN AS A DEADLY 
LEGACY FOR THE NEWLY FREE GOVERNMENTS OF THE EAST BLOC. 
</P>

BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Communism in Eastern Europe may have failed in most ways, but in one respect 
its success was undisputed: It produced some of the most comprehensive, 
efficient secret police networks in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
Dismantling them looms as one of the most formidable challenges facing the 
region's newly free governments. 
</P>
<P>
Murky, aloof and left remarkably intact by the sudden collapse of their Marxist 
creators and masters, the secret police apparatuses of Eastern Europe remain 
rogue institutional time bombs that inexperienced interim governments spent 
weeks trying to unearth before starting the delicate job of defusing them. 
</P>
<P>
In numbers alone, the problem is huge. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's dreaded Ministry of State Security -- known to Germans as the 
Stasi -- was the country's second-largest employer (next to the army) and kept 
active files on one-third of the country's 17 million people. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans last week were reminded again how far the Stasi's tentacles 
reached into their society when Wolfgang Schnur, the leader of a conservative 
political party and a man who made his name defending dissidents, admitted 
having worked with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a state within a state," conceded former East German Communist Party 
leader Egon Krenz. 
</P>
<P>
Only in January did East Germany belatedly move to cut the Stasi's pervasive 
powers by disarming its members and ordering its size cut to 10,000 from 85,000 
by the end of March. An independent citizens' committee now presides over the 
de facto dissolution of the apparatus, while some of the unknown hundreds of 
thousands blackmailed by the Stasi into informing on others have established 
encounter groups to try come to terms psychologically with their plight. 
</P>
<P>
In Romania, the Securitate once nurtured plans to operate 10 million 
microphones at a time, so that "every single family could be periodically 
monitored during each calendar year, with suspect ones continuously covered," 
Nicolae Ceausescu's former intelligence chief, Ion Pacepa, noted in his book, 
"Red Horizons." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the Securitate didn't fall far short of its goal. 
</P>
<P>
Moves to neutralize internal security forces are under way throughout Eastern 
Europe as fledgling democratic forces ponder safeguards that would prevent such 
a massive erosion of human rights from ever occurring again. 
</P>
<P>
Only in Romania and Bulgaria, according to area specialists, is there any 
prospect that the secret police could recover power significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have monitored the collapse of Eastern Europe's dictatorships predict 
that a few senior secret police officials will face trial and imprisonment as 
revelations of their activities are made. In Czechoslovakia, such fears have 
triggered a rash of suicides. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers, however, discount wholesale witch hunts. 
</P>
<P>
"All a nation needs is two or three big trials and then it becomes repetitive," 
commented Alex Pravda, a noted Oxford University Sovietologist. "These networks 
are all so big and diffuse, they can't get everyone." 
</P>
<P>
It is even possible that individuals whom the new governments consider both 
trustworthy and competent might be asked to help build smaller, more benign 
counterespionage groups, while those security figures with darker pasts are 
quietly retired. The vast majority, however, seem destined to search for new 
lives in new, more open societies. 
</P>
<P>
Some have even joined the free-market spirit of the time and gone private. In 
Poland, Interior Ministry officials report between five and 10 applications 
daily from former colleagues registering to set up private detective agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, however, the transition is not easy. Tomaj Barsi, chief spokesman 
for Hungary's Interior Ministry, noted that more than 100 members of his 
country's secret police resigned in disgust after refusing to swear allegiance 
to the country's new constitution, which omits any reference to communism's 
leading role. 
</P>
<P>
More often, though, the animosity is from the public, now displaying flashes of 
anger pent up for years. 
</P>
<P>
Angry East Germans have trashed the Stasi's offices, and potential employers 
frequently reject an applicant if the agent's past is discovered. One 
Czechoslovak groused that members of the secret police should take the 
janitors' and boiler tenders' jobs that they once forced on political opponents 
as the price of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, emotions are running so high, nobody wants them at all," 
commented one Prague resident. 
</P>
<P>
While anger is dominant, there is also a distinct fear remaining among the 
generations who have known no walls without ears and still glance instinctively 
over their shoulders. It was members of the Soviet secret police, the KGB, who 
first established Eastern Europe's pervasive internal security networks in the 
late 1940s and early 1950s and stayed on, first as advisers, then as liaison 
officers, to keep tabs on their proteges. 
</P>
<P>
Until their collapse, these networks generated the fear that made them 
communism's prime instruments of power. 
</P>
<P>
The ruthless, bloody defense of the totalitarian state mounted by Romania's 
Securitate may have been the exception in the otherwise peaceful collapse of 
Communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe, but it is also a lingering nightmare 
of what could have happened elsewhere. And, so long as there are remnants of 
these security networks, the region's new governments will remain jittery. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, rumors of a security police-led coup so paralyzed routine 
activity in Prague that Interior Minister Richard Sacher simply abolished the 
country's 18,000-strong secret police apparatus, ordered its agents to stay 
home during the day, then led reporters on a tour of the empty headquarters 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"Members of these departments have ceased all functions," Sacher declared, as 
the civilian police tried desperately to take over rudimentary internal 
security tasks. 
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, Communist Interior Minister Atanas Semerdziev announced on 
national television in February that the country's secret police had been 
disbanded, and he signed a declaration that opposition offices and telephones 
were no longer tapped. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that this public nervousness was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after Erich Honecker's neo-Stalinist regime fell in East Berlin, 
Stasi agents were still hard at work bugging political activists. And nearly a 
year after Hungary formally severed secret police links with the Communist 
Party and ended the political role of the police, agents were discovered 
reporting on opposition political meetings. That affair triggered the 
resignation of Hungary's interior minister and the chief of internal security 
and led to a parliamentary investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"These people just went on doing what they'd always done, and no one stopped 
them," said G. M. Tamas, an opposition member of the Hungarian Parliament and 
one of those investigating the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these incidents, area specialists believe the greatest threat to 
stability from old-guard secret police remains in Romania, where uncertainty 
about the Securitate hangs like a dark cloud over the country's democratic 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Communist Party's continued power has also unsettled people in 
that country, who fear a possible secret police revival despite government 
pledges to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
But, with a string of democratic elections on the horizon, the notion has begun 
to dawn that it would require more than a handful of disenchanted security 
police officers to reverse the tidal wave of change that has swept through the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Combining to reduce the threat, according to those familiar with the region, 
are the severing of Communist Party ties with the security police, the upcoming 
elections and the lack of support, either within the military establishments or 
among popular politicians, for short-circuiting the path toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"For a putsch (uprising) to succeed, you need political figures and the army," 
said Vladimir Kusin, a senior analyst at Radio Free Europe in Munich who 
recently compiled a status report on secret police groups in Eastern Europe. 
"Those conditions don't exist in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia or East 
Germany. In whose name? For what purpose? There may be a desperado or two, but 
not more." 
</P>
<P>
Added Hungarian lawmaker Tamas, a former dissident and target of secret police 
harassment: "I'm not afraid any more; I'm really not. Who is going to risk 
something like that (a coup attempt)?" 
</P>
<P>
Although every country maintains some form of internal security organization 
(in the United States it is the FBI), several factors point to smaller and more 
benign counterintelligence corps: a softening political climate, strong public 
resistance and the fact that funds for secret police work will likely have to 
be defended in the newly elected parliaments of financially strapped Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The dissidents are now in the government; our enemies are now our friends," 
summed up Tamas. "A big security force will be hard to justify." 
</P>
<P>
East German Communist Prime Minister Hans Modrow found that out the hard way in 
January. His attempt to justify a large new internal security force to combat 
neo-Nazi activities so enraged and dismayed his country's citizens that he 
immediately dropped the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Many governments in the region are only beginning to consider what democratic 
controls should be placed on new internal security networks. But if initial 
signs are an indicator, those controls will be extremely tight. 
</P>
<P>
All but Romania are committed to place their revamped secret police forces 
under some form of parliamentary supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has introduced one of the tightest systems anywhere. The secret police 
here must obtain the justice minister's written permission to tap a telephone 
-- the maximum time is 30 days. In addition, after the tap is removed, the 
justice minister will report to Parliament the names of those bugged. If no 
evidence for prosecution is uncovered, the secret police can be sued by the 
target of its surveillance for violation of rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a system far stricter than those in well-established democracies," 
Tamas insisted. "We have to watch our step." 
</P>
<P>
Among the nations fresh out of dictatorship, only Romania has done little to 
dismantle its secret police. The ruling National Salvation Front has placed the 
Securitate under military control, but there is little evidence that 
Ceausescu's private army is a spent force. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting mounting unease in Bucharest, a group of 46 prominent intellectuals 
recently signed an open letter contending that the Securitate still holds 
considerable power. They demanded that the government back up its claims that 
telephone tapping and other surveillance have stopped by publicly destroying 
the Securitate's centers. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we talk about the victory of the revolution when fear, physical and 
psychological threats go on?" they asked. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's Tamas, who was born and raised in the Romanian city of Cluj, recalled 
his own experience during a trip to his old hometown that provided a hint of 
the Securitate's grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
Tamas recounted how, shortly after the new year, a Securitate major who had 
interrogated him years before suddenly telephoned from a local prison where he 
faced a possible trial. The major wanted to know if Tamas would testify that he 
had not been physically tortured during his interrogation -- a point that Tamas 
indicated he would be willing to confirm. 
</P>
<P>
"An hour later, he phoned again, asking if I would agree to accept a case of 
French champagne with his compliments," Tamas said. "French champagne. In 
Romania. Ordered from a jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
"That's influence."

MOSCOW YIELDS, PERMITS JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL 
</P>

<P>
Under pressure from top Soviet government and Communist Party officials, Moscow 
city authorities agreed Wednesday to permit a weeklong international Jewish 
film festival despite their earlier fears that the festival might bring 
anti-Semitic demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing their previous decision, the city authorities said that "the 
political situation in the city . . . was less complicated" and that security 
could be provided for those attending the festival, scheduled to begin 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Cancellation of a festival of Jewish films because reactionary anti-Semites 
might protest against it amounted to the surrender of the Soviet Union's 
capital city to the worst sort of element," Rustam Ibragimbekov, president of 
the American-Soviet Film Initiative, one of the festival's sponsors, said he 
had argued in a telegram to Moscow Mayor Valery T. Saikin. 
</P>
<P>
"And to say that we cannot have a Jewish film festival during elections, which 
are now largely over, because passions might be aroused makes us all 
anti-Semites, and that we must also reject." 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong festival is expected to attract more than 50,000 people, making it 
the largest Jewish cultural event in Soviet history. The 29 films deal with a 
variety of Jewish themes. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet Jews need to know what Jewish life is outside the Soviet Union," 
Deborah Kaufman, the American director of the festival, said. "We give them 
broad-brush pictures and 'snapshots,' feature films and documentaries. . . . We 
were devastated when it looked like the festival was going to collapse just 
days before it was scheduled to open." 
</P>
<P>
Many Soviet officials had intervened this week with forceful arguments on 
holding the festival before Saikin relented, according to Soviet sources. 
Still, the battle was not easily won, they said, because of strong opposition 
within the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei S. Smirnov, secretary of the influential Soviet Union of 
Cinematographers, had declared that the city's decision denying the festival 
the theaters it needed amounted to political censorship. Another union official 
said that the festival would prove to be "an antidote to anti-Semitism" should 
it proceed. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Foreign Ministry warned city authorities that the image of the 
country as increasingly progressive and politically open under President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev would be seriously impaired by the festival's postponement 
or cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
Also, such a step could adversely affect all future cultural exchanges with the 
United States and other Western countries, the ministry reportedly told the 
city, after strong U.S. Embassy protests over the threatened cancellation or 
postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Leading members of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, including 
Fyodor M. Burlatsky, Sergei B. Stankevich and Arkaby Murashev, met with the 
festival organizers and later pressed their case with government and party 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
And the ideological department of the party's policy-making Central Committee 
told Moscow city officials that they had gotten their priorities wrong -- that 
their activities, including the latest decision, were undercutting domestic 
policies and damaging the country's foreign interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the circumstances, the appearance of tolerating and accommodating 
anti-Semitism destroys whatever sympathy we have earned generally for Soviet 
policies," a senior party official commented. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, however, one of our officials has trouble understanding and asks, 
'What is so special about a Jew?' That is sort of what has been happening with 
this festival." 
</P>
<P>
But Vladimir V. Ploshansky, director of the firm that runs Moscow's movie 
theaters, who earlier in the week complained that he would lose money for every 
day of the screenings, commented Wednesday: "We are only too pleased to be able 
to do this, and I don't think I want to say more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, of the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, called the reversal "quite 
dramatic -- we have gone from despair to full satisfaction, and that in 24 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
"Take the security issue, for example," she continued. "Only on Tuesday, we 
were being told that the festival could not be held because security would be 
difficult; a day later, the police told us there would be no security problems 
that they could not handle." 
</P>
<P>
The festival now has commitments for use of the prestigious theater at the 
Rossiya Hotel off Red Square for the opening and closing ceremonies and for the 
rental of three movie houses in central Moscow to show the 29 films through the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five ultra-rightist Soviet groups, often seen at the heart of 
present-day anti-Semitism as well as Russian nationalism, announced Wednesday 
that they have joined forces to promote a czarist monarchy to save Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing that our country is now in a very dangerous situation, we decided to 
form the Russian Orthodox popular sentiments into a fist to smash in the teeth 
of the scum who want to see Russia destroyed," Evgeny Pashkin, an activist who 
helped bring the groups together, said, referring to liberals "and especially 
Jews." 
</P>
<P>
"Russia's salvation lies with God and patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the groups' program spoke darkly about threats from Jews or Zionists 
and of conspiracies by them to take over the country, though they number only 
about 2 million people in a country of more than 287 million.

NATION'S 1ST HOMELESS COUNT IS HIT-AND-MISS; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: WHILE BUREAU OFFICIALS CALL THE EFFORT A SUCCESS, CRITICS CLAIM IT WAS 
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's first census of homeless people, at best, was a hit-and-miss 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
While officials of the U.S. Census Bureau pronounced the effort a success 
Wednesday, reports from communities large and small indicated the overnight 
campaign to count street people and shelter dwellers frequently was botched. 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau officials said the results of the homeless census, which involved 
about 15,000 census takers assigned to visit more than 20,000 locations, will 
not become available until next year. Within hours after the dusk-to-dawn 
effort concluded, however, critics were saying the census is not likely to 
resolve the decade-long debate over how many Americans are homeless. Estimates 
have ranged from a few hundred thousand to a few million. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a strong sense there was a tremendous undercount," said Jessica Heinz, 
a Los Angeles assistant city attorney who spent Tuesday night monitoring the 
homeless count. Heinz said census takers arrived at several places late, after 
homeless people who had been waiting to be counted had left. And she said 
counters never came to one downtown shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Her concerns were echoed in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I told 60 million people on the 'Today' show that there would be an accurate 
count of the homeless in this city," the Rev. Del Maxfield said at his Denver 
Rescue Mission. "If what we are looking at in Denver is indicative of what 
happened across the nation, I'll be the first to say it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The accuracy of the count is a potent political issue -- with money and power 
riding on its outcome. The size of the homeless population helps determine both 
the amount of federal aid cities receive and the number of elected officials 
who will represent them in Congress and state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the stakes, two cities in southeast Los Angeles County actually 
were fighting over the right to claim 34 homeless men as their own. The men 
spend their days in Compton and then are bused at night to a shelter the 
Salvation Army runs in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Compton officials wanted them counted as Compton residents. But census 
officials had decided the homeless people would be credited to Bell, where they 
were found sleeping Tuesday night. Compton officials scrambled to find a way to 
house the men for the night on temporary cots, but the plan did not work. 
</P>
<P>
In several cities across the country, including Los Angeles, assessment teams 
retained by the Census Bureau tended to reinforce the prevailing pessimism 
about the homeless count's accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"At best I would give it a 'C,' " said Kathryn Edin, an associate professor of 
sociology at North Point College in Chicago. Edin headed a monitoring effort in 
that city. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in Denver, Detroit and Houston, census takers either overlooked or 
were locked out of large homeless shelters. In San Angelo, Texas, homeless 
counters spent the pre-dawn hours searching for street people and finding only 
deer and jack rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless counters in a Brooklyn neighborhood fled from gunfire. No one was 
shot. Two census takers were robbed at knifepoint in Ft. Lauderdale. Elsewhere, 
they were cursed, chased off porches and menaced with a baseball bat. In 
Northern California's Santa Cruz mountains, census takers skipped known 
homeless habitats where shots were fired two years ago at census employees 
doing preparatory work for the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, 60 observers took up positions at outdoor homeless gathering places 
in downtown neighborhoods as part of the census assessment effort. Census 
takers showed up at half of the locations, according to Edin. And where they 
did come, they did little more than count heads. 
</P>
<P>
"We only saw one or two instances where enumerators actually interviewed 
people," Edinsaid. 
</P>
<P>
Louisa Stark, who directed another assessment effort in Phoenix, told a similar 
story. Census takers came to only half of the homeless locations observed by 57 
monitors, said Stark, who is director of the city's nonprofit Community Housing 
Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The news was worse from the Census Bureau's homeless assessment in Los Angeles. 
Officials of the Homeless Health Care Project recruited 79 people to pose as 
homeless people on Skid Row street corners and other spots frequented by the 
down-and-out. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cousineau, executive director of the Health Care Project, reported 
Wednesday that only 22 of the 79 people sent out were interviewed by census 
takers, and that just 35 of the 79 reported even seeing census enumerators. 
</P>
<P>
Cousineau said no census takers were in evidence at one downtown theater where 
250 homeless people were known to have spent the night. He said the census 
missed several other places where 20 to 25 homeless were congregated. Nor were 
census takers always eager to leave their cars when they came upon groups of 
homeless people, Cousineau said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one hillside," he said, "where a bunch of people were sitting 
around. A carload of enumerators drove by, yelling, "how many are there up 
there?" 
</P>
<P>
Gary Blasi, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation in Los Angeles and a 
board member of the National Coalition for the Homeless, estimated Wednesday 
that the census counted only 10% to 20% of the homeless population downtown and 
much less in other areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
John Reeder, the Census Bureau's California regional director, said he had no 
idea how many homeless people were counted or missed Tuesday night. And while 
he said that census takers would be going out Wednesday to a few locations that 
had been overlooked, he was upbeat about what went on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"No one was hurt," he said. "We are happy about the turnout," Reeder said at a 
press conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But when Brian Kimbrough, a census taker sitting next to Reeder, was asked how 
many homeless people were counted in Los Angeles, he replied, "we were getting 
6 out of 10." To which Reeder conceded: "That's not a very good figure. . . . 
That would be a pretty bad count." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Census Bureau Director Barbara Bryant, while admitting there had 
been "problems and incidents" around the country, on Wednesday hailed the 
operation as a success. 
</P>
<P>
"Shelter and Street night appears to have been a success," Bryant said. "I 
believe our efforts have given us a good start on achieving our goal of a full 
and fair census of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of last night's efforts," Bryant said, "the various components of 
the homeless population can begin to receive their fair share of political 
representation and assistance programs that are based on population." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant did say that census takers would return Wednesday night to a few places, 
among them Cleveland and Washington, where they were not able to finish their 
work Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's confidence in the count came under fire from some quarters, although 
there was evidence the homeless census had gone well in a number of places. 
</P>
<P>
"When she says it is a success, she doesn't know what she is talking about," 
said David Hayden, a former Catholic priest who runs Justice House, a home for 
destitute families in Roanoke, Va. Hayden has been sleeping on Washington 
streets this winter to protest Congress' failure to provide $25 billion a year 
for adequate housing. 
</P>
<P>
But in Northern California, several homeless advocates said they thought the 
count had gone well. Several members of the Coalition on Homelessness, a San 
Francisco group, walked the city's streets after 2 a.m. Wednesday to ask 
homeless people whether they had been counted. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually every one of them had," said coalition member Josh Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
In New Orleans, one of the five cities chosen for an assessment by the Census 
Bureau, the homeless census was reported to have gone fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say many of the homeless were indeed enumerated. Some were not," said 
James Wright, a professor of sociology at Tulane University who headed a 
61-member assessment team. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, where 121 observers were dispatched to places favored by the 
city's teeming homeless population, "80% to 90% of the observers saw census 
enumerators interviewing homeless people," said Jude Travers-Frazier, who was 
part of the assessment effort. 
</P>
<P>
But for many census takers, the Tuesday night experience was one of fear and 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared driving down there (to a Detroit census office)," said Darlean 
Brownies, "and I thought 'please God, don't send me to an abandoned building.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
With less than 100 census takers working in Detroit, only two of the city's 
myriad abandoned homes were canvassed. 
</P>
<P>
Three census workers fled the sound of gunfire early Wednesday morning as they 
approached a Brooklyn apartment building where they had hoped to interview 
homeless people nearby and inside. Census Director Bryant said the three 
resumed their work 10 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"You can assume it was a warning shot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ft. Lauderdale incident, the two census workers were robbed of a watch, 
a ring and a small amount of cash, according to Rhea Faberman, a spokeswoman 
for the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a team of three enumerators quickly found themselves the targets of 
bottles, shoes and other blunt objects as they tried to approach a group of 
sleeping men on the columned porch of an abandoned building. As one of the 
census workers tried to reason with the men on the porch, one of them began 
swinging a baseball bat menacingly. 
</P>
<P>
Census takers at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park didn't have much luck when 
they tried to lure people sleeping in the bushes by calling out to them from 
the sidewalk and promising that they were not the police. 
</P>

BUSH SEEKS ARTS FUNDING WITHOUT CONTENT CONTROLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The White House, fending off demands that it limit the content of federally 
supported art, Wednesday sent Congress a proposal to renew arts funding without 
any restrictions on subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration proposed a five-year extension of the National 
Endowment for the Arts and rejected content controls like those that sparked an 
uproar here last year and led to a one-year congressional ban on financing of 
obscene art works. 
</P>
<P>
NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer, testifying before a House subcommittee 
considering a budget authorization for the arts, said: "After much careful 
thought and discussion, it is our conclusion that the legislation proposed 
here, which contains no content restrictions . . . will best serve the American 
public." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA controversy centers around objections by some conservatives to federal 
support for artworks that may be offensive, sacrilegious or indecent. 
</P>
<P>
The protests were set off last year by two photographic exhibits that received 
NEA support. One, by Robert Mapplethorpe, included sadomasochistic and 
homoerotic themes. The other, by Andres Serrano, depicted a crucifix in a jar 
of urine. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) objected vehemently to those projects and pushed 
through a measure that withheld $40,000 of the NEA's funding, the equivalent of 
the money spent on the two controversial projects, and imposed the one-year 
restrictions. The NEA's budg et for this year is $171 million. 
</P>
<P>
"To those who are offended, I am truly sorry," Frohnmayer said of last year's 
controversy. But, he told the subcommittee, "art is like research. It is trying 
new things, taking risks, pushing boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all art succeeds. To not do research is to stand still and be bypassed by 
the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA director also pointed out that the endowment relies heavily on reviews 
by citizens' panels in issuing grants. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), chairman of the House education and labor 
subcommittee, called the proposal announced by Frohnmayer "a major piece of 
information and news." 
</P>
<P>
But while the Bush proposal was welcomed by arts groups and arts supporters in 
Congress, it promises to lead to more difficult congressional and public 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
In Raleigh, N.C., Helms announced that he had written to the General Accounting 
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, demanding an investigation of the 
arts endowment. In a statement, Helms contended the arts endowment had 
continued to fund pornographic artworks despite the restrictions imposed last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer, in his testimony, angrily denied that the NEA has ever had a policy 
of promoting obscene artworks. He attacked right-wing groups by name -- 
including the Mississippi-based American Family Assn. and the fundamentalist 
"700 Club" television program -- and accused the family association of mounting 
an advertising campaign "seeking to raise funds . . . at the expense of the 
National Endowment for the Arts." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. E. Thomas Coleman (R-Mo.), the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, 
complained that the controversy and debate over the NEA reflected "a bumper 
sticker mentality" in which discussion "has been simplified down to whether one 
supports pornography . . . or censorship." 
</P>
<P>
But Coleman said the content of some of the photographic images that were the 
initial source of the controversy that began last year remains troublesome. He 
and Rep. Paul B. Henry (R-Mich.) warned Frohnmayer it may be impossible to 
navigate the NEA reauthorization bill through Congress without content 
restrictions being attached at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not attempt to justify artworks that offend common sense standards of 
decency," Coleman said. He said it may be inevitable -- even desirable -- that 
a political compromise will have to be struck under which the NEA authorizing 
law would contain "appropriate language that will guarantee freedom of artistic 
expression and accountability" for possibly offensive content. 
</P>
<P>
"I, for one, am deeply distressed by some of the grants funded by the NEA," 
Henry told Frohnmayer. But he was even more sharply critical of what he 
characterized as "duplicity and moral posturing" by members of Congress who 
have become the NEA's most effective adversaries. Though he did not mention 
them by name, Henry, Williams and other subcommittee members made it clear they 
were referring to Helms and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita). 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the political posturing on this issue is itself pornographic," the 
Michigan Republican said. But, he said, "please don't blind yourself to the 
political reality. The NEA has some explaining to do. In order to save it, we 
are going to have to reform it." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement Wednesday, Helms said he "is deeply concerned about the NEA's 
apparent indifference to enforcing the congressional ban on funding obscene 
art." 
</P>
<P>
Despite personal assertions by Frohnmayer that the endowment would not, as a 
matter of policy, fund obscene works, Helms said that "the evidence to the 
contrary is so compelling that it is imperative that there be an objective 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Helms' letter, addressed to Controller General Charles A. Bowsher, included 
several examples of allegedly pornographic art. At the opening of the letter, 
Helms cautioned Bowsher that "because of the nature of the enclosed material, I 
urge that great care be taken to assure that your women associates are not 
exposed to the material." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA said Frohnmayer had no immediate comment on the demand for a GAO 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Coleman pressed Frohnmayer specifically to clarify remarks 
he made at a subcommittee hearing two weeks ago at the J. Paul Getty Museum in 
Malibu when, responding reluctantly to repeated questions by Williams, 
Frohnmayer said it is appropriate for the federal government to support 
artworks that may be offensive to some people. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is artistically excellent," Frohnmayer told Coleman on Wednesday, "it 
does not make it unfundable just because it is offensive. Some art is 
offensive. That is not to say that (artistic) voices ought to be denied federal 
funding, if it is excellent art." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum and Ahmanson Theatre 
in Los Angeles and one of several artists and arts advocates who testified, 
told Henry that "the (problem with) restrictions (on the content of 
federally-supported art) is: Where do you stop? The people who want limitations 
are not going to stop" with comparatively mild language such as wording 
inserted into the NEA's appropriation bill for this year, which bans funding 
for obscene art unless it can legitimately be characterized as artistically 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you try to define what good art is," Davidson said, "you're lost."

PUBLIC RELATIONS WEIGHTED DECISION TO HALT SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN and RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision by state agriculture officials this week to set a May 9 deadline 
to end aerial malathion spraying in Southern California was as heavily weighted 
by public relations considerations as by science, according to officials 
involved in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Battered by protests from environmentalists, residents and local politicians, 
Department of Food and Agriculture officials in charge of eradicating the 
Mediterranean fruit fly from Los Angeles and Orange counties decided they had 
to send a loud and clear message to the public that California was winning the 
war against the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"Just saying 'trust us' wouldn't do it," said Isi Siddiqui, the state's point 
man in the eradication program. "We had to show them. . . . It was time for us 
to make a decision and tell the public the end is in sight. We had to turn this 
around." 
</P>
<P>
But, in setting the deadline and choosing to phase out aerial pesticide 
spraying in favor of eliminating the pest through the release of sterile 
Medflies, Agriculture Department Director Henry J. Voss was rejecting the 
recommendation of the state's scientific advisory panel on the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Monday at a Sacramento meeting of Voss, Siddiqui, 
Associate Director Rex Magee and Deputy Director Robert C. Fox. According to 
Siddiqui and Magee, Siddiqui argued for the deadline and Voss agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Some agriculture officials concede that setting a firm deadline of May 9 is 
potentially risky. If the strategy fails and the state has to resume spraying, 
it could further inflame a population angered over repeated malathion 
sprayings, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to aerial spraying of malathion has mounted in recent weeks and a 
number of cities have unsuccessfully brought court actions aimed at halting the 
spraying. Critics contend the safety of malathion spraying is uncertain while 
the state contends it is not harmful to people in the small doses used. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said the decision to stop spraying would not have been made so soon if 
not for a meeting of the state's scientific advisers a week earlier to review 
the eradication program's progress. 
</P>
<P>
To the state's surprise, the panel of five entomologists recommended that 
spraying continue, despite the near completion of a second breeding facility in 
Hawaii that promised an abundant supply of sterile flies to breed the pest out 
of existence. The scientists were skeptical that the facility could produce 
enough sterile flies, and they recommended that shipments be held in reserve in 
case of new outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said the recommendation directly contradicted promises the state had 
been making for months -- that spraying would be phased out as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'The department has made commitments to public officials and the 
media,' " Siddiqui said. "We cannot hold 150 million sterile flies in reserve 
and say to folks, 'We're just going to continue spraying you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, nonetheless, stuck by their recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"The panel was sending a signal to people that this thing is going to go on and 
on," Siddiqui said. "We had to set the record straight. If we didn't, there 
would be people saying, 'You could have used the sterile flies in May.' " 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said he was forced now to send out an equally strong message to 
counter the panel's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the panel, however, had viewed their recommendation as the 
safest course, both scientifically and politically. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture entomologist in Hawaii and the 
chairman of the panel, said the recommendation provided Voss with a 
justification for continued spraying while insulating him against the 
uncertainties of future sterile Medfly supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mr. Voss is putting himself into a corner he didn't need to be in," 
Cunningham said. "It's more or less a political thing. Suppose we commit 200 
million steriles to these areas and then production (of the sterile flies) 
falls? We're just leaving ourselves open." 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said he felt an immediate and strong response was needed to the 
panel's recommendations. He demanded and got a one-hour meeting with Voss on 
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Voss, who was in Washington Wednesday and not available for comment, was 
confronted with two issues. One was whether to simply reject the panel's 
recommendations and phase in sterile fly releases as soon as practical. The 
other was whether to attach a firm date to the end of spraying in already 
infested areas. 
</P>
<P>
The first question was easy to decide, Siddiqui said. The state had always 
maintained that it would use alternatives to aerial spraying whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
The eradication program began that way last year with single sprayings followed 
by the release of sterile flies. But the infestation grew so quickly that the 
state depleted its supply and had to rely on repeated pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Now the situation was different. Not only had no new flies been discovered in 
five weeks, but also adequate numbers of sterile flies were soon expected. 
Voss, Siddiqui and Magee knew that a second breeding facility in Hawaii was 
close to completion. 
</P>
<P>
With that information, the decision was clear, Siddiqui said. "How could we 
explain to the public if we had all these sterile flies but continued 
spraying?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding whether to place a deadline for the end of spraying was a trickier 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was that critical," said Magee, who thought the state could 
have waited until April or May before making a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
But Siddiqui argued the state should not just reiterate its vague position that 
sterile Medflies would be phased in during May or June -- a stand that would do 
little to alleviate criticism. The state had to provide a concrete date, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui's staff calculated that a sufficient number of sterile flies would be 
on hand by May 9 and that spraying could be discontinued. And Voss agreed to 
the date. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said additional spraying may be necessary if additional flies are 
discovered before May 9 in some of the already infested areas and enough 
sterile flies are not available. 
</P>
<P>
If wild flies are discovered in new areas, sterile flies will be released after 
a maximum of two malathion sprayings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the state is confident that the sterile flies will arrive in 
sufficient quantities and that most areas will soon see their last helicopter 
sorties.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ATTORNEY GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
SMITH GOES FOR THE JUGULAR IN VITUPERATIVE DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two Democratic contenders for state attorney general are both pro-choice, 
pro-death penalty, pro-environment and anti-drug. 
</P>
<P>
But in the first head-to-head appearance here this week, San Francisco Dist. 
Atty. Arlo Smith cast aside the lack of differences on major issues and went 
for the jugular of his opponent, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before about 100 members of the City Democratic Club, Smith, 62 -- who 
looks more like a bean counter than a street fighter -- jabbed away at Reiner's 
record, his style and his conduct in office. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, Smith told the capacity crowd, lacks integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, Smith declared, lacks professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
And Reiner, Smith told reporters afterward, is more interested in garnering 
publicity than in achieving results. He cited as examples Reiner's public 
statements on such nationally visible cases as the McMartin Pre-School child 
molestation trial and the Zsa Zsa Gabor cop-slapping trial. 
</P>
<P>
"My opponent has squandered his integrity as a lawyer to advance his political 
career," the three-term San Francisco prosecutor concluded. "Mr. Reiner is a 
politician. I am a professional." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, rarely at a loss for words, appeared taken aback by Smith's aggressive 
debate style. He responded mainly by defending his record rather than hurling 
similar brickbats. But he did declare: "It is unfortunate that a person who 
seeks higher office sets forth as the reason . . . simply a personal attack on 
their opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most people are frankly disgusted by it." 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said he was "very, very pleased" by the confrontation. He said he 
looks forward to further debates, including one at the state Democratic 
convention in Los Angeles early next month. Reiner said he also stands ready 
for additional forums. 
</P>
<P>
The vituperative rhetoric of this week's debate adds further fuel to a race 
that has heated up in recent weeks. Last year, Smith, little-known outside the 
Bay Area, trailed Reiner badly in the polls, and the highly visible Los Angeles 
prosecutor was able to effectively ignore him. 
</P>
<P>
That has changed, in large part, observers believe, because of the recent 
acquittals of defendants Ray and Peggy McMartin Buckey in the McMartin 
molestation case. One recent poll, in fact, placed Smith a percentage point 
ahead of Reiner with statewide voters. 
</P>
<P>
During an audience question-and-answer period after the candidates' opening 
statements Tuesday night, Reiner conceded that the McMartin case "has had a 
temporary effect." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be temporary," he continued. "If I'm wrong, I'm wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The two-term Los Angeles prosecutor added that he has showed his professional 
mettle by having reached the controversial decision to retry Ray Buckey on 
several counts on which the jury could not come to a verdict. "It's going to be 
tried and tried well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, for his part, questioned the decision by Reiner's office to use a 
tainted jailhouse informant in the initial trial. The informant, George 
Freeman, had perjured himself in previous court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a New York Times editorial, Smith asserted: "You think that I've been 
critical? I'm not critical. You know what the New York Times said? These are 
the reserved editors of the New York Times. They said that action on using that 
jailhouse informant was desperate and sleazy. Quote unquote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very gentle," Smith concluded, to loud laughter from the audience, which 
packed a meeting room of the San Francisco Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
There were also fireworks over Reiner's 1986 censure by the State Bar for 
violating conflict-of-interest rules while he served as Los Angeles city 
attorney. In that case, Reiner publicly criticized members of a secret Los 
Angeles Police Department intelligence unit while defending the city in a 
lawsuit alleging illegal spying by the unit. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was working hand in hand with the police to drive the gangs out of San 
Francisco, my opponent was turning his back on police officers in order to get 
a 10-second sound bite on the evening news," Smith asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner replied that he still believes he acted correctly in denouncing the 
excesses of the police spying unit. "I had a duty to the public, not the 
officials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few issues on which the pair differ is the so-called speedy trial 
initiative slated for the June ballot. Smith supports it. Reiner, agreeing with 
the position taken by gubernatorial candidate Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, 
said he fears the wording could eventually lead to restrictions in abortion 
rights. Reiner said he instead supports Van de Kamp's efforts to place an 
alternative initiative on the November ballot that would be identical to the 
June one except to clarify the abortion question. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Smith-Reiner primary will face uncontested Republican Dan 
Lungren in the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Tuesday night that he is not concerned about Lungren exploiting the 
Democrats' demolition derby. 
</P>
<P>
Citing his own basic agreement with Reiner on abortion rights and Lungren's 
contrasting anti-abortion stance, Smith told reporters, "Mr. Lungren is so far 
out there on issues of choice it is just inconceivable any Democrats could 
support Mr. Lungren."

DRUG FUGITIVE ON LOOSE LEASH WHILE BEING HELD IN MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: DANIEL FOWLIE WAS APPREHENDED ON 49 CHARGES FILED IN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH 
HE LIVES IN PRISON, 'THEY KINDA LET ME DO WHAT I WANT AROUND HERE NOW,' HE 
SAYS.

CABO SAN LUCAS, Mex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a recent Mexican court ruling opposed an extradition request by the 
United States, life in prison has become a lot more comfortable for one of the 
most wanted men in Southern California's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel James Fowlie, jailed in Mexico on American charges that he ran a vast 
marijuana operation based in Orange County, says that since the December ruling 
he has been released to go marlin fishing, visit his beachfront home and pursue 
a construction business here in this roost for American sportsmen and suspected 
gateway for drugs bound for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the court ruling could mean more than just an occasional release for rest 
and relaxation. Ultimately, the decision by the Colegiado del 12th Districto 
could free Fowlie, 57, who federal investigators say did business with drug 
lords suspected of killing U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique 
(Kiki) Camarena Salazar in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
A final review of the Mexican ruling is pending, but U.S. officials are not 
optimistic it will be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
The drug charges against Fowlie, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
include conspiracy to distribute and sell hundreds of thousands of pounds of 
marijuana and lesser amounts of cocaine, and operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the court in Mazatlan opposed the U.S. extradition request, 
concluding that Fowlie's return would violate the Mexican constitution. The 
judges said that the evidence against him comes mostly from felons, viewed as 
generally unreliable, and that Mexico recognizes no such crime as "conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
If Fowlie is released, the loss will be a major blow to a 5-year-old criminal 
prosecution that has led to the convictions of five people, including his two 
sons, and resulted in the seizure of Rancho del Rio, Fowlie's 213-acre spread 
on the east Orange County border. The rustic site, worth an estimated $6 
million, was turned into a huge prop last summer for a national address on 
drugs by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch "was the core of an international marijuana and cocaine smuggling 
ring," Bush told a crowd of 1,500 people from a podium near Fowlie's front 
porch. "How many lives, how many families, how many hopes and dreams have been 
destroyed with these chemical weapons of death and destruction -- drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Dog-and-pony show," said Fowlie, who believes his secluded ranch was seized 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no tape recordings, no drug buys, no nothing on me," Fowlie 
continued. "When they do get something on me, it's always (from) some other 
criminal and that's what they don't like down here. Those guys are three-time 
losers and full-time liars. . . . I like Mexican justice better. They stick to 
their laws." 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie's release, investigators warn, also could thwart any chance to question 
and perhaps make a deal with a man who could provide useful information about 
the reputed drug lords suspected of killing Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
Experts in Mexican law say Fowlie's conditions of confinement during his 
extradition fight are typical of those for inmates who have money, prominence 
or the persuasiveness to convince authorities that they will not escape if 
released for short periods. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is that this is clearly irregular and there is no legal basis for 
this type of action," said Prof. Jorge A. Vargas, director of the Mexico-U.S. 
Law Institute at the University of San Diego School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
If Fowlie is being released improperly, Vargas said, it could trigger a "very 
serious" investigation by Mexico's judicial authorities, including the attorney 
general's office and Ministry of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
"They kinda let me do what I want around here now," said Fowlie, an inmate at 
Centro de Readaptacion Social in La Paz, a prison known as CERESO. "There are 
people in Cabo San Lucas who still believe in me. They know these charges in 
the United States have ruined my life and that I haven't been convicted of 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, and to the dismay of U.S. authorities, Fowlie is not just 
surviving, he is doing relatively well. He has been allowed to stay 
occasionally at the rock-and-tile house he owns on beachfront property north of 
Cabo San Lucas, where his prized pit bulls stand guard, including Rosie, a 
reddish-brown dog that survived a concussion grenade in the 1985 raid on Rancho 
del Rio. 
</P>
<P>
His wealth, he says, has come from years of land investments and the "Leather 
Gypsy," a successful leather goods business in Laguna Beach he sold for $3 
million in the early 1970s. He moved to Latin America shortly after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
He said his engineering skills and construction equipment recently have been 
enlisted by a Mexican real estate company with big plans for a shopping center. 
And he said the bar association of Baja California Sur commissioned him to 
paint a long-eared, horned owl for Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the president of 
Mexico. Fowlie has a photograph of the presentation to the president. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie has displayed his other watercolors and oils of fish and marine fowl at 
art shows in the hotel-studded fishing village. From painting alone, he says, 
he has made thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In town, the charismatic Fowlie is known by scores of hoteliers, restaurateurs, 
lawyers and skippers of sportfishing boats that are docked in the snug harbor. 
</P>
<P>
In prison, Fowlie wears his own clothes, usually jeans and flannel shirts. He 
is on a first-name basis with the staff, and the atmosphere in the jail yard is 
more akin to a city park. To help him take care of business on the outside, his 
Jeep Cherokee is in the parking lot and he has hired an errand boy for $400 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't abuse the privileges and I have never tried to escape," Fowlie said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanned and fit, Fowlie is housed behind CERESO's whitewashed walls in a wing 
reserved for inmates awaiting trial. He says his cell, which he shares with 
seven prisoners, measures 12 feet by 15 feet -- nothing extravagant. 
</P>
<P>
In the jail yard, large thatched umbrellas and trees in brown cinder-block 
planters provide shade for visitors and inmates' families. On one side is a 
refreshment stand selling sodas and candy. In the center, meat sizzles on the 
grill of a carnitas stand. 
</P>
<P>
"They make great hamburgers," Fowlie said. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, children chase each other around the yard, which is equipped with 
a slide and swing set. Vendors sell sweet rolls, embroidered blouses and carved 
sailing ships in green tinted bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The only reminder of prison is the concrete guard tower, where a sentry stands 
with an M-16 assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the country club of Mexican prisons," said Kathy Peterson, a U.S. Foreign 
Service officer responsible for checking American prisoners in Baja California. 
"The facility is clean, in a good climate, and there's plenty of food. I have 
visited him (Fowlie), but he is not much interested in seeing us." 
</P>
<P>
The commandant of CERESO could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
American diplomats and FBI agents working on the Fowlie case said they have 
heard rumors that he has been let out of prison repeatedly to take care of 
personal business. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly eager to get him back," said Special Agent Jim Nielson, a 
spokesman for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
But embassy officials and federal authorities are pessimistic about getting 
Fowlie back and say there is not much they can do about it. Diplomatic pressure 
on Mexican authorities doesn't always work, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not much we can do except file the extradition papers," said Special 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Sanford Feldman, who is handling the Fowlie case. "We 
believe we have a strong case against him. Others have pleaded guilty and the 
important players in the alleged operation are set to testify." 
</P>
<P>
But Fowlie said the charges are greatly exaggerated and the product of three 
convicted drug dealers who "made up stories" to save themselves. If anything, 
he says, he is the victim of people who took advantage of his permission to 
live and work on Rancho del Rio during his 16-year absence from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been convicted of anything," Fowlie said. "They have taken all my 
money and seized all my property so I can't defend myself. They've got my kids 
in jail and caused my divorce. How much more do they want?"

VIOLENT DEATHS OF 2 OFFICIALS JOLT SAN DIEGO SCHOOL SYSTEM

<P>
The San Diego city school system has been jolted by the deaths during the 
weekend of two district administrators, including a top-ranking one, in what 
police have termed a murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Associates of one of the victims, meanwhile, contend that the police made their 
judgment too quickly and are demanding further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were George Frey, 57, an assistant school superintendent in charge 
of the district's community relations and integration programs, and Elizabeth 
Tomblin, 43, who directed the district's program evaluations department. Police 
believe Frey shot Tomblin while she was visiting him at his San Diego home, 
then shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
Several colleagues of the pair, all of whom asked for anonymity, said Frey and 
Tomblin had been romantically involved. Frey had been divorced three times; 
Tomblin was married. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Dave Cohen said, "It's a murder-suicide; all the evidence 
available to us indicates that very strongly." 
</P>
<P>
But some of those who knew Frey are skeptical of that conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an effort to defend anyone, but we do not believe that anyone can 
tell immediately what the circumstances were," said Herb Cawthorne, chief 
executive officer of the Black Federation, a group that runs social service 
programs in San Diego. "We think the conclusion of the police was premature." 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Frey and Tomblin were found early Sunday morning along a short 
stairway leading to a sunken first-floor bedroom in Frey's home. Frey, shot in 
the head, was found on top of Tomblin, who had also been shot in the head as 
well as a thigh, according to the county coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking police official familiar with the case said Frey was "going with 
(Tomblin) for a couple of years" and that the two may have been breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
Frey's house showed no signs of being burglarized, police said. According to 
the official familiar with the case, a .22-caliber pistol was found by the 
bodies "where (Frey) would have dropped it." There was no suicide note, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomblin's husband, Douglas, a Bonita veterinarian who lives in La Mesa, had 
notified police Friday night that his wife was missing, police spokesman Cohen 
said. He filed another missing-person report Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Police discovered the bodies after a co-worker of Tomblin's saw the woman's car 
parked outside Frey's house late Saturday, yelled into the house and then 
called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Kudumu, a community activist who had known Frey for 20 years, was among 
those questioning the murder-suicide scenario. "It just doesn't fit," said 
Kudumu. "I know George as a person who runs every day. He fashioned his 
lifestyle around longevity." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Smith, Frey's longtime neighbor and a former school board president, 
agreed. "I don't believe that George Frey killed Betty Tomblin. And it would be 
impossible for him to commit suicide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Frey, who was appointed assistant school superintendent in 1983, is credited 
with propelling the integration of San Diego's school system to national 
acclaim, San Diego Unified School District Supt. Tom Payzant and others said. 
Driven by what he saw as an imperative to improve the plight of minority 
students, he designed a number of innovative and effective programs, the school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Frey previously was a principal at San Diego's Morse High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomblin was a reserved, poised woman who was meticulous about her work, 
colleagues say. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very polished, very mannered -- just like a lady from another era," 
school board President Kay Davis said.

LIKUD BLAMES U.S. FOR SHAMIR'S DOWNFALL; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: PARTY LEADERS CHARGE THAT PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON UNDERMINED THE PRIME 
MINISTER. 
</P>

<P>
In offices of Likud Party leaders, the losers' locker rooms of this week's 
political contest, there was plenty of blame being spread around for the 
apparent loss of the prime minister's post to the Labor Party, and not a little 
of it Wednesday was placed on the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of the Likud faithful, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was undermined 
by unrelenting U.S. pressure not only to promote peace talks beyond the range 
of his own policies but also on a number of other touchy subjects. If President 
Bush was not trying to push Shamir out, he was a major contributor to his 
downfall, Likud officials charged. 
</P>
<P>
"The criticism from Washington kept piling up. No matter what we did, it was 
wrong," said government spokesman Yossi Olmert. "There was an air of constant 
displeasure in Washington that hurt Shamir at home." 
</P>
<P>
There has long been suspicion among Likudniks that the Bush Administration 
favors the center-left Labor Party, headed by Prime Minister-designate Shimon 
Peres, over Shamir's rightist Likud. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the day after being tapped to succeed Shamir, Peres was busily 
trying to pull together enough parliamentary support to set up a government. He 
wooed two religious parties with promises of ministries and money for their pet 
projects, schools and housing. Labor officials predicted that he would announce 
a new Cabinet by next week. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir rejected a cursory invitation from Peres to join him as a junior partner 
in a new unity government because Peres has promised to move ahead with 
American-brokered peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We will act with all our ability so that a government headed by Mr. Peres is 
not set up," said Arab Affairs Minister Ehud Olmert of Likud. "We think that a 
government headed by Mr. Peres is not good." 
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Moshe Nissim, also a Likudnik, said that a Labor-led 
government would cause "severe political damage to Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Yossi Olmert produced a list of conflicts with Washington that seemed 
designed to upset the Shamir regime: Israel's military contacts with South 
Africa and Ethiopia; the criticism from Bush over Israel's abduction of a 
Muslim cleric in southern Lebanon last year; the issue of aid to Soviet Jewish 
immigrants who settle in East Jerusalem, and Washington's continued dialogue 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The latest irritant to Shamir's government came in the form of a State 
Department report that essentially absolved the PLO of authorizing terror 
attacks on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The report listed nearly 30 border and rocket attacks by Palestinian groups 
against Israel since PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat renounced the use of terrorism 
in December, 1988. But it added: "We have no evidence in those cases or any 
others that the actions were authorized and approved by the PLO Executive 
Committee or by Arafat personally." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Olmert said the report "is not relevant to reality." 
</P>
<P>
"The PLO continues to be deeply involved in terrorist activity against Israel, 
both in Israel proper and in the occupied areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Olmert's argument was partially undercut by Israel's army chief of staff, Lt. 
Gen. Dan Shomron, who told a Parliament committee that there is no proof that 
Arafat's faction in the PLO, Fatah, is carrying out attacks against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Besides looking to Washington, some senior Likud officials found cause for 
blame within the party. Intra-party rivalries reached a high pitch in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We were giving not the impression of ruling, but of trying to hold onto 
power," said top aide Yosef Ben-Aharon. "If the battle for succession begins, 
Likud could disappear for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Likud rivalries are set to reignite, however. 
</P>
<P>
"If Peres nears forming a government, everyone will be smelling blood," 
spokesman Olmert said.

TOKYO STOCKS PLUNGE BUT RECOVER HALF OF LOSS 
</P>

<P>
Stock prices plummeted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange this morning, with the 
Nikkei index taking a free-fall through the symbolic 30,000-point barrier 
before rebounding significantly in an afternoon rally to close at 29,843.34, 
down 963.85 points. 
</P>
<P>
As investors lost confidence in the strength of the yen and in the ability of 
financial authorities to stabilize the currency and securities markets, the 
Nikkei collapsed by more than 1,800 points in the morning session to reach its 
lowest level -- 28,971.12 -- since November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the afternoon rally, in which the index recovered 869 points, the 
day's trading underscored an increasingly pessimistic mood in Kabutocho, or 
Japan's Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The loss represented a 3.1% decline in the Nikkei from its finish Tuesday, when 
it fell 456.05 points on the eve of a national holiday Wednesday when markets 
were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Although some brokers warned of a "melt-down scenario" seizing the stock 
market, the world's largest in terms of capitalization, others noted that 
volume remained relatively low and that an atmosphere of crisis had not set in 
on the trading floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say we're not seeing panic yet," said Lynne Ross, director of equity 
research in Tokyo for the French brokerage, W.I. Carr. "But there's a definite 
lack of confidence in the government's ability to restore stability in bonds, 
and to back up the yen." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at above 155 yen in morning trading, higher than 
the 154.65 close in New York on Wednesday, reflecting speculation that the 
Japanese currency would continue to weaken despite Tuesday's 1 percentage point 
hike in the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan. The dollar had closed 
here Tuesday at 153.65 yen. 
</P>
<P>
In a vicious circle, stock prices declined on pessimism over the strength of 
the yen, which in turn lost value because of the trouble in the stock market, 
traders and analysts said. Dealers also reportedly bought dollars on remarks by 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that a stronger U.S. currency would be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
Intervention by the Bank of Japan -- which reportedly sold $700 million worth 
of greenbacks this morning -- failed to stem the yen's decline, which was 
traded at its lowest level in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto confirmed today that he would fly to 
Washington over the weekend to meet with Brady to discuss foreign exchange 
policy coordination and financial issues under discussion in the Structural 
Impediments Initiative talks. 
</P>
<P>
But on the whole, authorities reacted coolly to the continued bearishness in 
the stock market -- where the Nikkei average has lost 23% of its value since 
the market peaked at 38,915.87 on Dec. 29. By comparison, the Nikkei shed only 
about 21% during the global stock panic of October, 1987.

U.S., SOVIETS ARE LECTURED BY MANDELA;

<P>
APARTHEID: THE BLACK NATIONALIST BOLDLY SUMMONS BAKER AND SHEVARDNADZE TO 
SEPARATE MEETINGS.

<TEXT>
<P>
South African black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, savoring the sort of 
treatment usually reserved for a head of state, summoned Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III to a 
rented house Wednesday for back-to-back lectures on the evils of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
With Baker at his side, Mandela told reporters that the secretary of state's 
planned meeting today in Cape Town with South African President Frederik W. de 
Klerk might cause the rest of the world to ease the pressure on the white 
minority government. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not think that there has been any fundamental change in the policy of 
the (South African) government," said Mandela, who was released last month 
after 27 years in a South African prison. "There is nothing which Mr. De Klerk 
has done up to now which would require a change of strategy on the part of the 
international community. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the foreign secretary of a superpower now visits Mr. De Klerk 
can create a great deal of confusion, specifically that the Nationalist 
government has done something which requires a change of attitude on the part 
of the international community," he said. "We regard that as regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
Baker responded that the Bush Administration approved his meeting with De Klerk 
in order to show support for "efforts (that) are being made in good faith to 
move the process forward in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's important to try and encourage that process to move forward," 
Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this difference of opinion, Mandela and Baker both said they are in 
complete agreement on the objective of replacing South Africa's official policy 
of racial segregation with a non-racial democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I regard Mr. Baker, the American government, the Congress and the people of 
America as true friends," said Mandela, deputy president of the African 
National Congress, the chief anti-apartheid organization opposing De Klerk's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
A spirited diplomatic byplay preceded the half-hour Baker-Mandela meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials were confident that the meeting could be arranged when 
both men were in Windhoek to attend Namibian independence ceremonies, the 
African National Congress avoided setting the date until late Tuesday. The 
agreement called for Mandela to call on Baker at the U.S. ambassador's 
residence where the secretary of state was staying. 
</P>
<P>
However, about five minutes before the scheduled 11:15 a.m. meeting, Mandela's 
aides called the U.S. delegation to say that Mandela was running late and to 
ask if Baker would mind coming to him. American aides, putting the best face on 
the breach of diplomatic protocol, said Baker "gladly agreed." 
</P>
<P>
When reporters arrived at Mandela's headquarters in a luxurious rented house a 
few blocks from the official U.S. residence, they encountered Shevardnadze, who 
was just leaving after his own audience with Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very good meeting," Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also held an hourlong meeting with De Klerk, who was in Windhoek 
to officially relinquish South African control of its former colony. De Klerk 
had insisted on meeting Baker in Cape Town, but presumably agreed to confer 
with Shevardnadze in Namibia because the Soviet official was unwilling to go to 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
As Baker arrived at Mandela's headquarters, the black leader said, "I'm very 
sorry that we had to make this arrangement, but we have a tight schedule." 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official later sought to focus attention on the 
"atmosphere of friendship" that surrounded the meeting.

Tens of thousands of Namibians took to the streets Wednesday in a riot of pomp, 
color and pageantry to celebrate their nation's independence. 
</P>
<P>
The world's newest nation, which became the 160th member of the United Nations, 
launched a massive street party to mark the end of colonial domination, first 
by imperial Germany and since 1915 by neighboring South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
President Sam Nujoma and his Cabinet were installed by U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
At the ornate Tintenpalast (Ink Palace) in Windhoek, the elected delegates who 
drafted Namibia's liberal constitution voted themselves into power as a 
National Assembly, dominated by Nujoma's South-West Africa People's 
Organization (SWAPO). Nujoma's keynote speech concentrated on the country's 
economy, and he again buried SWAPO's Marxist past with a strong call for a 
mixed economy and private investment.

President Bush lifted U.S. sanctions, which were extended to Namibia when it 
was under South African control, and established full diplomatic relations.

FRANCE: PARTY LEADERS AGREE TO A TRUCE AFTER A SCOLDING FROM PRESIDENT 
MITTERRAND.

<P>
After a scolding from French President Francois Mitterrand, feuding Socialist 
Party leaders called a truce Wednesday in a bitter, oddly premature power 
struggle to see who will succeed him as the party's next presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Said by aides to be "embarrassed and furious" over the public squabbling among 
his would-be political successors -- they are the prime minister, two 
government ministers, the Speaker of the National Assembly and the president of 
the European Commission -- Mitterrand summoned party first secretary Pierre 
Mauroy to the Elysee Palace late Tuesday. He called for a cease-fire in the 
succession battle, which comes a full five years before his term as president 
expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting all night, the party leaders emerged at 5 a.m. Wednesday with a 
compromise plan that will keep Mauroy, a former prime minister, as party first 
secretary and portion out other key party posts to supporters of the five 
rivals for Mitterrand's job. 
</P>
<P>
According to political analysts here, the fight inside the Socialist Party was 
the worst in the 20 years since Mitterrand, 73, built it into an important 
national political organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The Socialist Party will likely pay dearly for the disastrous effects produced 
by the quarrels between these pretenders who are only thinking about the 
succession of Francois Mitterrand," wrote editor Andre Fontaine in an editorial 
on the front page of the influential Paris daily Le Monde. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of the cracks in the ruling party were obvious over the weekend at its 
biennial convention in the Brittany capital of Rennes. The four-day meeting 
ended in disarray after delegates, hooting and whistling at rivals of those 
they supported, failed to agree on a party platform or name someone to the 
important post of first party secretary. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to break the convention deadlock, centered mainly on a feud 
between National Assembly Speaker Laurent Fabius and Education Minister Lionel 
Jospin, both presidential contenders, party leaders gathered in Paris beginning 
Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Ideological differences were a factor in the convention debate, mainly between 
factions that favor a market-directed, social democratic role for the party 
(Fabius, Prime Minister Michel Rocard and European Commission President Jacques 
Delors) and those who favor a more traditional leftist model (Jospin, Mauroy 
and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement). 
</P>
<P>
However, most of the fighting was purely political and personal, with eight 
government ministers lined up behind Fabius, the 43-year-old French political 
wonder-child who is said to have the personal blessing of Mitterrand, and most 
of the rest behind Jospin. 
</P>
<P>
The Jospin-Fabius rivalry dates to 1988, when Jospin successfully blocked an 
attempt by Mitterrand to install Fabius as party first secretary, replacing 
Mauroy. The party secretary position is considered essential for anyone seeking 
the nomination to replace Mitterrand if he retires, as expected, in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the fray in Rennes was Mitterrand himself, who has had little 
direct involvement in the party since he was elected to his second seven-year 
term in May, 1988. True to his new nickname in the French press -- Dieu ("God") 
-- Mitterrand kept an Olympian distance from the rowdy meeting, sending only a 
short greeting wishing them luck in "your convention." 
</P>
<P>
Part of this, one diplomat here noted, is because Mitterrand, who received 54% 
of the vote in the 1988 election, is more popular than his own party, which 
seldom tops 35% of the vote, and therefore feels no need to be involved in the 
daily grit of political life. 
</P>
<P>
However, Michel Martin-Roland, co-author of a new, two-volume political 
biography of Mitterrand scheduled for publication in October, said the 
president followed the convention closely from home, fearing the unseemly 
bickering would damage the party in National Assembly elections in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"Mitterrand's main priority," said Martin-Roland, "is to have a nice ending to 
his second seven-year term. He wants to make sure that the 1993 National 
Assembly elections are not a remake of 1986." 
</P>
<P>
That's when the Socialists lost assembly elections and Mitterrand was forced to 
rule France in a "cohabitation" with Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mitterrand favors Fabius, the man many think may benefit most from the 
party divisions is Mitterrand's old political rival, Rocard. In every Socialist 
convention since 1971, it was Rocard, representing the centrist-right wing of 
the party, who was at the center of debates. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the prime minister sat mostly on the sidelines, except for issuing 
occasional statements urging party unity. Since he was named prime minister in 
1988, Rocard, 59, has been a popular leader, second only to Mitterrand in most 
political polls, despite the fact that his Socialist government does not 
control a majority of seats in the National Assembly and must count on the 
Communists for votes on key issues. 
</P>
<P>
However, he is still resented by Mitterrand purists for his opposition to the 
president during previous conventions.

Ten Contras were killed when a contingent of 200 attacked Sandinista government 
troops, the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the attack occurred Tuesday in Ubu Norte, a village in the 
northern province of Matagalpa. 
</P>
<P>
It did not mention Sandinista casualties or elaborate on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The reported attack appeared to be one of the biggest in the last two years. 
The Contras have generally operated in smaller groups since the U.S. Congress 
cut their military aid in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The military statement said the attack violated a unilateral cease-fire decreed 
by the leftist Sandinistas shortly after they were defeated in elections Feb. 
25 by a pro-U.S. coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Some Contras are resisting demobilization unless the Sandinista army is 
disbanded. The Sandinistas say they need the army for protection until the new 
government is installed on April 25.

</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: PRESIDENT CITES A POOR MEMORY. THE JUDGE AT POINDEXTER'S TRIAL 
UPHOLDS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CLAIM IN DENYING A DEFENSE REQUEST FOR DIARIES.

The voice of Ronald Reagan filled a federal courtroom for five hours Wednesday 
as jurors watched the former President discuss his recollections of the 
Iran-Contra affair in videotaped testimony at the trial of John M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, which appeared mostly attentive during the often tedious testimony 
shown on four television sets, heard Reagan cite a poor memory as the answer to 
dozens of questions about the Iran-Contra case. 
</P>
<P>
As the day began, U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene denied a request for 
access to Reagan's personal notes and diaries, which defense lawyers had sought 
to clear up facts that Reagan could not recall. 
</P>
<P>
Upholding Reagan's claim of "executive privilege" over the diaries, Greene said 
the poor memory of a witness "does not automatically entitle a party . . . to 
rummage through (his) personal papers," particularly those of a President. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling represented a reversal by Greene, who earlier this year had ruled 
that Reagan should turn over his diaries. But after Reagan claimed executive 
privilege, Greene reconsidered. Wednesday he said he had decided that the 
diaries were not significant enough to be "essential to the achievement of 
justice" for Poindexter, who was national security adviser under Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who has examined excerpts from the diaries in private, said the 
notes "are brief and even cursory; the longest consists of five sentences. 
</P>
<P>
"The topics about which he (Reagan) recalled the least are also the ones about 
which he wrote nothing or virtually nothing," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Reagan "did testify under oath at great length about many 
specific activities in his Administration -- an event that is unprecedented in 
American history." 
</P>
<P>
Although other past presidents, including Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and 
Jimmy Carter, have given court testimony, their accounts were sharply limited 
in scope. 
</P>
<P>
In Reagan's videotaped testimony, which was released in transcript form to the 
press last month, he insisted he did not authorize the $14-million diversion of 
funds from Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan resistance and did not 
authorize Poindexter or anyone else to violate any laws. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter is being tried on five charges of conspiracy, obstruction of 
congressional inquiries and making false statements to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan repeatedly underlined his confidence in his embattled former aide and 
made clear that Poindexter's efforts to support the Contras in the face of 
congressional opposition were, in effect, an extension of Reagan's strongly 
held principles. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan referred to the Boland Amendment, a congressional prohibition on U.S. 
aid to the Contras, as "a disaster." He was asked whether he and Poindexter 
ever had discussed ways to obtain more congressional aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything more than just to carry the battle to them (members 
of Congress)," Reagan replied. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, Reagan said on the videotape that he could not recall details 
of specific meetings with Poindexter and other top aides, once asserting that 
he held an average of 80 conversations a day. 
</P>
<P>
The jury spent all day Wednesday watching much of Reagan's eight hours of 
videotaped testimony and is expected to complete the task this morning. The 
sessions were taped Feb. 16 and 17 in a sealed courtroom in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although transcripts had been given to reporters last month, and reporters had 
been allowed to watch the tape, actual copies of the videotape were provided 
Wednesday for the first time to the television networks. 
</P>
<P>
The former President appeared relaxed and in good humor during most of his 
session, although he frowned frequently when asked about events he could not 
recall. Jurors smiled at one point when Reagan mistakenly referred to France as 
having been involved in the Iran-Contra affair, then corrected himself 
good-naturedly.

LAWYER WHO CRASHED IN OCEAN INDICTED ON 33 FEDERAL CHARGES

Thomas Root, the lawyer who ditched his plane in the Atlantic Ocean last 
summer, was indicted Wednesday on 33 counts of fraud and other crimes involving 
radio stations that he was representing before a federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
The federal grand jury indictment accuses the 37-year-old Root of defrauding 
the federal government and five clients in Federal Communications Commission 
proceedings on permits to construct FM radio stations throughout the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of all charges against him, Root would face a maximum 200 years in 
prison and an $8-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
Root burst onto the public scene last July when his single-engine plane ran out 
of gas and plunged into the Atlantic off the Bahamas after a six-hour, 800-mile 
flight that began near Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Doubts about Root's story began to surface almost immediately. He told 
authorities that he had been unconscious for most of the odyssey, but Navy 
fighter pilots flying alongside the plane reported seeing him moving in the 
cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens told a news conference that a mysterious gunshot 
wound that Root suffered during the flight was part of an ongoing 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens said Wednesday that Root had been aware of the inquiry, which began in 
April, 1989. He said 31 of the 33 counts in the indictment involved activities 
that took place before Root's July 13 plane flight.

BRAIN ABNORMALITIES FOUND IN SCHIZOPHRENICS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: SCIENTISTS STUDYING TWINS HAVE COME UP WITH RESULTS THAT SUGGEST 
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS MAY BE AS IMPORTANT AS GENETICS IN DEVELOPING THE 
DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Government scientists studying identical twins have found physical 
abnormalities in specific areas of the brains of victims of schizophrenia, a 
discovery that should eventually lead to the development of new therapy for the 
estimated 50% of victims of this disabling mental illness who cannot now be 
adequately treated with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Studying pairs of twins in which only one had the mental disorder, researchers 
from the National Institute of Mental Health report today in the New England 
Journal of Medicine that the afflicted twin in virtually all cases had a 
slightly smaller brain in certain key areas, suggesting a non-genetic 
abnormality in growth of the brain during development. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have long known that genetics play a key role in the development of 
schizophrenia, and assumed that environmental factors, such as exposure to a 
virus during fetal development, played a lesser role. The new results suggest 
that such factors may be as important as genetics. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a landmark study," said Dr. Lewis L. Judd, NIMH director, "because 
previous efforts to link brain abnormalities to schizophrenia have been clouded 
by the difficulty of interpreting normal variations in individual brain 
structures. Only by comparing the brains of twins who . . . would be expected 
to have identical brain structures could NIMH researchers show that the twins 
with schizophrenia consistently had brain abnormalities not present in their 
healthy identical twins." 
</P>
<P>
Because the abnormally small brain segments were found in virtually all twins 
studied, researchers assume that the finding will hold true for most 
schizophrenics. If so, that would constitute one of the few unifying features 
of this enigmatic disease. 
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenia afflicts, or will afflict, about 1% of the population, an 
estimated 2.5 million Americans. It is characterized by inappropriate emotions, 
hallucinations and disordered thought processes that cause difficulties in 
communication, interpersonal relationships, and distinguishing between the real 
and the imagined. It is commonly confused with split or multiple personalities, 
but that is an entirely different class of disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"While schizophrenia is by no means the most common mental illness," according 
to an NIMH report, "it is probably the most costly and devastating in terms of 
human suffering." NIMH has estimated the annual cost of schizophrenia to the 
U.S. economy as $21 billion, while the National Academy of Sciences has said 
that it costs society as much as $48 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers have reported finding evidence of structural abnormalities in 
the brains of schizophrenics, such as a smaller hippocampus, which is involved 
in thinking and perception, but interpretation of these studies has been 
difficult because of the large variability in brain size from individual to 
individual. A given "abnormality" might thus be found in only a third to a half 
of patients studied, leaving open many questions about its role in the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings by neurologist Daniel R. Weinberger and his colleagues at 
NIMH's St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington should answer those questions. 
These findings, along with a previous study by psychiatrist Michael Reveley of 
London Hospital in the United Kingdom, provide "nearly definitive evidence" of 
the existence of structural abnormalities in the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Reveley and his colleagues reported in 1982 on computed tomography (CT) 
scanning of 12 sets of identical twins. CT uses X-rays to image cross-sections 
of the brain. In 11 of the 12 pairs, they found that the affected twin had 
larger ventricles, fluid-filled cavities in the brain. By inference, if the 
ventricles were larger than normal, the brain tissue must have been smaller 
than normal. 
</P>
<P>
But the CT scans did not have high enough resolution to show which parts of the 
brain were smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberger and his colleagues used a newer technique called magnetic resonance 
imaging, which provides a much more detailed picture of the brain. "It's like 
holding a brain in your hand," he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
They studied 15 pairs of twins, eight male and seven female, with an age range 
of 25 to 44 years. They found that, compared to the normal twins, the left 
hippocampus was significantly smaller in 14 of the schizophrenic twins and the 
right hippocampus was smaller in 13. The schizophrenic twins' temporal lobes 
were also smaller. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 of the twin pairs, the differences were so large that the afflicted twin 
could be readily identified just by looking at the images. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Weinberger said, "researchers can focus in on a specific area as 
consistently abnormal and find out what has happened, what has specifically 
affected it. . . . Before, if an area was found to be only occasionally 
abnormal, it wasn't worth all that much attention." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, he said, researchers will be able to find specific biochemical 
abnormalities in those regions and develop new drugs to force the biochemistry 
back to normal.

bone disorder, a four-year study released Wednesday said. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that, 
although fluoride did increase bone mass, the new bone was structurally unsound 
and the treatment actually led to a threefold increase in the number of bone

Angel Aragon struck out eight and limited Newbury Park High to two hits 
Wednesday to lead Channel Islands to a 10-0 Marmonte League baseball victory at 
Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Aragon (2-1), a right-handed sophomore, held the Panthers hitless through 6 1/3 
innings before surrendering consecutive singles. Several professional scouts 
interested in Channel Islands' Jacob Cruz were at the game, according to Coach 
Don Cardinal, but Aragon put on his own show. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guys that this is a good opportunity for you to show your stuff 
and, boy, he did," Cardinal said of Aragon. "He blew them away." 
</P>
<P>
Cruz, who has been battling bronchitis for the past two weeks, had two hits to 
raise his average to .628. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands' George Alvarado had three hits and Jose Gastelum had two, 
including a three-run home run in the first inning, and five runs batted in. 
</P>

RULING ON ILLINOIS S&amp;L COULD DISRUPT BAILOUT PLAN; 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge ruled Wednesday that federal regulators lack constitutional 
authority to seize an ailing Illinois savings and loan, throwing into disarray 
the nation's already troubled thrift bailout program. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth in Washington agreed with Olympic Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan of Berwyn, Ill., that the 7-month-old U.S. Office of Thrift 
Supervision lacks authority to seize the thrift because its previous director, 
M. Danny Wall, and its current one, Salvatore R. Martoche, were improperly 
named to their posts. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said the ruling only temporarily bars the government from seizing 
the suburban Chicago institution and is not expected to unravel the seizure of 
any of the more than 350 S&amp;Ls operating under government supervision. They 
added that it also does not take away the government's basic right to seize 
insolvent institutions. 
</P>
<P>
But it does add confusion, delays and ultimately higher costs to the nation's 
bailout fiasco because other already seized thrifts or those expecting to be 
seized may sue on similar grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Already by late Wednesday, at least one such suit had been filed. San 
Diego-based Imperial Corp. of America, former parent of Imperial Savings Assn., 
said it filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Diego seeking a restraining 
order and preliminary injunction to overturn the Feb. 23 seizure of Imperial 
Savings as unconstitutional. Imperial Corp. of America, which filed for 
bankruptcy protection on Feb. 28 following the seizure of its thrift unit, 
cited Lamberth's ruling as grounds for its claim. 
</P>
<P>
Such legal challenges, if successful in delaying or overturning seizures, could 
add to estimates that the bailout will cost taxpayers $285 billion over 30 
years -- roughly $1,100 for every man, woman and child in the nation. Any more 
delays could cost millions, even billions, of dollars if regulators find their 
hands tied by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"What the court is saying is that nobody at the agency is in a position to be a 
decision maker. That's hard to understand," said Eugene M. Katz, acting chief 
counsel for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said government lawyers will ask an appeals court judge today to stay 
Lamberth's order and will request an immediate hearing to appeal the case. 
Lamberth declined late Wednesday an OTS request to suspend his order. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic's basic argument was that Wall lacked legal authority as head of the 
Office of Thrift Supervision because he was never confirmed by the Senate. Wall 
had been chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and continued as the 
chief regulator for S&amp;Ls when the bank board was replaced by the OTS as 
part of last year's S&amp;L rescue legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Lamberth said Wall "required re-nomination and re-confirmation before he could 
constitutionally take office as OTS director." He added that because Wall "was 
never re-nominated or re-confirmed, he never constitutionally took office." 
</P>
<P>
Wall left the job earlier this month amid criticism that he mishandled the case 
involving the scandal-plagued Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. Wall was 
replaced by acting OTS director Salvatore R. Martoche, and President Bush has 
since nominated a permanent successor, Washington lawyer T. Timothy Ryan, who 
must be confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Lamberth ruled that Martoche's temporary appointment by President Bush under 
legislation to fill federal job vacancies is also improper because Martoche is 
replacing someone who wasn't properly confirmed. If this procedure were 
permitted, "the President could unconstitutionally 'appoint' an 'officer,' have 
him resign and then use the vacancies act to fill the post for up to 120 days," 
Lamberth said. 
</P>
<P>
Lamberth tempered his ruling by noting that he was not "closing the door on the 
OTS" and also not invalidating actions taken by Wall or Martoche. "Olympic has 
not asked this court to issue a sweeping injunction prohibiting the director 
(of OTS) from taking any action against any S&amp;L," Lamberth said. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged the ruling could have a major affect on the agency, which 
he said was secondary to the Constitutional issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Although this may lead to a great deal of litigation and place OTS operations 
in some confusion, the clear violation of (Olympic's) constitutional rights and 
the public's interest in protecting the Constitution outweigh these harms to 
the public interest," Lamberth wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic was solvent under the old thrift rules but insolvent under new laws 
that went into effect last year. Those laws wiped out an intangible asset 
called goodwill. Thrifts such as Olympic could claim on their books that 
goodwill was capital, which is the financial cushion a thrift must maintain 
against losses. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Olympic Chief Executive John J. Lanigan said the thrift sued 
because "word on the street" was that it was to be seized any day after 
regulators in February turned down the thrift's business plan to restore its 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
He said Olympic had an investor lined up willing to put money into the thrift 
and the investor would have walked away from the deal if regulators seized 
Olympic. At that point, he said, Olympic decided to challenge the OTS using the 
novel argument that Wall's appointment was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
"The law had quite a few Constitutional flaws. We happened to detect a few and 
the judge happened to agree with us," Lanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his home in Virginia, Wall called Lamberth's 
ruling bizarre and said it hurts efforts to clean up the thrift problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that delays costs more money," Wall said. "The irony is that it is 
the taxpayer that is funding this litigation because it is an insolvent 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
But most lawyers predicted that the OTS would probably prevail in challenging 
Lamberth's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much to be lost and nothing to be gained by that kind of position. 
It's hard to see a court that will take such a technical position even though 
this judge did," said Norman H. Raiden, a Coast Savings executive vice 
president in Los Angeles who formerly was the top lawyer at the Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
Some also predicted that the ruling could prompt a speedy confirmation of Ryan, 
who could then affirm the actions of Wall and Martoche. Lamberth's ruling, 
after all, specified that Martoche or any other OTS official cannot appoint a 
conservator for Olympic until a new director is "constitutionally appointed." 
</P>
<P>
Paul H. Irving, a thrift lawyer at the Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; 
Phillips law firm in Los Angeles, said regulators still maintain the power to 
put thrifts under restrictions that are so tight that it would almost be as if 
they were seized. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is you have a guy with a private hat on handcuffed to his chair 
instead of a guy with a government hat on handcuffed to his chair," Irving 
said.

AGENCY ENTERS VIRGIN TERRITORY IN AIRLINE ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First there were automobile ads that didn't show cars. Now along comes an 
airline with ads that show baby carriages and Christmas trees -- but few signs 
of travel. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin Atlantic Airways recently began to barrage the Los Angeles market with a 
new print, billboard and television ad campaign, but don't look for any jets. 
The closest thing that viewers will see in any of the ads is a paper glider 
that comes flying out of a baby carriage in one TV spot. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual campaign is an attempt by tiny Virgin Atlantic to gain attention in 
one of the world's most competitive air travel markets -- Los Angeles. Starting 
May 16, the airline will begin flying daily round-trip, nonstop flights from 
Los Angeles to London for $499. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little guy in a business inhabited by mega-carriers," said David Tait, 
executive vice president of Virgin. "This campaign is our 2-by-4-over-the-head 
approach. Once we get the consumers' attention, we can start softening the 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
The airline -- which owns fewer than a dozen jets -- has a Southern California 
advertising budget of just $2 million. So it is trying to gain attention in Los 
Angeles with ads that look totally unlike those conventional airline 
advertisements that feature smiling flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin, which flaunts the advertising slogan, "The entertainment capital of the 
sky," prides itself on in-flight entertainment. This includes a wide-ranging 
choice of meals and movies on all flights, not to mention 12 music channels on 
its high-tech stereo headsets. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin's mission to entertain has earned it enthusiastic support from younger 
travelers who would rather see music videos on the in-flight movie screen then 
yesterday's news summaries. But sometimes the airline's urge to entertain gets 
a little wacky. On one Easter Day flight from New York to London several years 
ago, passengers were handed crayons, scissors and cardboard so they could make 
cardboard Easter eggs and bonnets. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment offerings like these will be highlighted in upcoming ads created 
by the New York agency Korey, Kay &amp; Partners. 
</P>
<P>
But Virgin's very first print ad in Los Angeles, which ran in several 
newspapers last week, left many readers perplexed. That ad, which had no 
headline, showed a metal foot-measuring device commonly used in shoe stores. 
Although the ad never mentions Richard Branson -- the brash British founder of 
Virgin Atlantic -- by name, it implies that he has made life so miserable for 
the competition that one airline executive finally quit to become a shoe 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine that they'd get one call based on that ad," said Arlynn 
Whittaker, senior vice president of marketing at Admarketing, the Los Angeles 
agency that formerly created ads for AirCal and MGM Grand Air. But Virgin 
claims that it is receiving up to 1,000 extra calls a day since its campaign 
began in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker, however, said she is much more impressed with Virgin's upcoming ads. 
So is Peter Stranger, president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, 
McNamee WCRS. "If the ads are arresting enough to suck people into the body 
copy, that's all that is needed." 
</P>
<P>
These ads will detail Virgin's veritable three-ring circus of in-flight 
entertainment. First-class passengers, for example, can select from 50 movies 
to personally view during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
One new ad features a uniformed British schoolboy who has an iron ball and 
chain strapped to his foot. "At age 15, his headmaster said he'd either wind up 
rich or in prison," the ad states in reference to Branson, the airline's 
38-year-old founder. "He founded Virgin Records. Virgin Music. Virgin Video. 
And two of London's hottest dance clubs. From a man who knows a thing or two 
about entertainment comes entertainment in its highest form." 
</P>
<P>
"Our single mission is to build awareness," said Michael Glavin, vice president 
of Korey Kay. "If people just look at the ads and ask, 'Who are these guys?' 
that's all we want."

PRESS MONOPOLY GETTING MIXED REVIEWS IN DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>
<P>
DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be a marriage of profitable convenience, a newspaper merger 
that only an accountant could love. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, last November's partial merger of the Detroit Free Press and the 
Detroit News hasn't really made the accountants -- or the advertising 
salespeople, for that matter -- all that happy. 
</P>
<P>
The historic newspaper war between the Free Press and the News, two of the 
nation's largest and most tradition-rich metropolitan dailies, came to an 
abrupt end with their merger under a joint operating agreement. The JOA -- the 
largest ever in the newspaper industry -- was finally approved by the U.S. 
Supreme Court last year after more than three years of legal challenges. It 
allowed the papers to merge their business operations under a special exemption 
from antitrust laws granted the newspaper industry by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In return for the right to form what amounts to a newspaper monopoly, the two 
papers, now managed by the new Detroit Newspaper Agency, must retain separate 
editorial voices. They now publish separate editions during the week and a 
joint paper on Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, during the first few months of the joint agreement, newspaper executives 
here have found that running a monopoly isn't always what it is cracked up to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"Creating a JOA is not a marriage made in heaven," noted newspaper industry 
analyst John Morton. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the initial projections by Wall Street analysts that Gannett and 
Knight-Ridder -- the media giants that are the parent companies of the News and 
the Free Press, respectively -- would immediately begin to reap huge profits 
from their Detroit merger have proven quite premature. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are making money, but not a lot," observed Morton. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do a little better than break even this year," agreed Robert Hall, the 
publisher of the Free Press and the executive vice president of the Detroit 
Newspaper Agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the merged papers have been successful in one regard -- they have managed 
to anger just about everyone in town. 
</P>
<P>
Circulation complaints from readers skyrocketed as the two papers struggled to 
merge their distinct distribution networks. For several weeks after the merger, 
the letters to the editor columns of both papers were filled with angry 
missives from longtime readers threatening to cancel their subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters and editors, meanwhile, have complained that the papers are losing 
their identities, since the staffs of both papers must now contribute to a 
single, merged weekend edition. 
</P>
<P>
At the Detroit News, especially, the joint agreement has brought traumatic 
change. 
</P>
<P>
To eliminate direct competition between the News and the Free Press, the News' 
morning edition was dropped by the newspaper agency, sending the News back to 
its traditional afternoon delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the morning edition has cost the News its longtime circulation lead 
over the Free Press, sapping newsroom morale. Although official circulation 
figures won't be released until later this spring, the News' daily circulation 
has declined by roughly 200,000 since the joint agreement began, according to 
newspaper sources. 
</P>
<P>
But spirits are equally low at the Free Press. After enduring lengthy wage 
freezes during the legal battle required to win court approval for the joint 
agreement, newsroom staffers were disgusted to find that the company was 
willing to raise wages by only $30 per week after the merger went into effect. 
Many staffers feel as if the Free Press, which was scheduled to close if the 
joint agreement had been rejected, is still operating on a shoestring budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We went for three years without raises, with news space cutbacks," said Luther 
Jackson, a Free Press reporter and unit chairman for Local 22 of the Newspaper 
Guild, which represents Free Press editorial employees. "And then, people 
thought the JOA would solve everything. It didn't." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to buck up spirits at the Free Press, editors and reporters 
recently held staff "retreats" away from the newsroom to hash out their 
complaints, but problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
"Morale is at a very low point, not just here but at both papers," said another 
Free Press reporter. 
</P>
<P>
But worst of all, local advertisers became furious over the huge advertising 
rate hikes imposed by the Detroit Newspaper Agency for both papers. As a 
result, at least some advertisers scaled back their ad purchases in the 
metropolitan dailies and poured more money into local television and radio as 
well as into the smaller suburban newspapers that ring Detroit. The biggest 
blow came when Sears pulled $1 million worth of advertising out of the Free 
Press and News and put it into a string of suburban papers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their advertising linage is significantly down," said Tom Reynolds, 
advertising director of a string of suburban papers owned by Adams 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the suburban papers -- many of which had initially opposed the 
joint agreement -- sensed an opportunity almost immediately. "We've seen a nice 
increase in business since the JOA was announced," noted Richard Aginian, 
president of Suburban Communications, which publishes the Observer and 
Eccentric Newspapers in suburban Oakland County, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Adams Communications took advantage of the situation in February by launching 
its first Sunday edition, called Suburban Sunday. It's a vehicle designed to 
soak up some of the readers and advertisers turned off by the joint weekend 
edition of the Detroit papers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a baby of the JOA," said Ben Burns, editor and publisher of Adams' 
Michigan papers. "We started planning before (the joint agreement) went into 
effect, and we found that if there was only one Sunday paper, rather than two, 
then there would be room for another one." 
</P>
<P>
But now, the Detroit dailies are finally starting to fight back. In early 
March, they began to offer new "zoned" advertising packages at discounted 
prices. Zoned advertising allows advertisers to place ads only in newspapers 
delivered in certain sections of the metropolitan area, while paying much lower 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Detroit Newspaper Agency's competitors concede that the zoned 
advertising will help attract many of the smaller advertisers who fled when the 
Detroit papers' higher rates went into effect. And the suburban papers are 
still mindful that the Detroit dailies will remain the dominant media in town. 
</P>
<P>
"They are still the most sizable print medium around," said Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is going to replace them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after their rocky start, executives at the Detroit papers are now 
increasingly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising is picking up," Hall said. "And I think personally, for the JOA 
and the Detroit Newspaper Agency, each week is better than the previous week."

Mobil to Enlarge Refinery: Mobil Corp. said it was expanding its largest U.S. 
refinery located in Beaumont, Tex., at a cost of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion, scheduled to begin in the third quarter, will increase the 
plant's capacity to 325,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the current 285,000 
barrels. The bigger refinery will enable Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil 
company after Exxon Corp., to substantially increase production of 
higher-profit super unleaded gasoline and distillate fuels, such as home 
heating oil. The project, which is expected to be completed by the third 
quarter of 1992, will also reduce emissions from the plant.

India Rejects Coke Bid: Coca-Cola lost its bid to return to India when the 
government turned down an application that would have allowed the soft-drink 
maker to compete with domestic producers. 
</P>
<P>
Even a spokesman for Coke's top competitor, Pepsi-Cola, criticized the move as 
a return to economic nationalism by India, which in recent years had encouraged 
foreign investment. Commerce Secretary S. P. Shukla said Coke's application to 
build a $3-million plant in an export zone had been rejected. A spokeswoman for 
the Ministry of Commerce said "protection of India's domestic market played a 
major factor in the decision."

Emerald Homes Sells Divisions: Emerald Homes L.P., a Phoenix-based limited 
partnership that designs, builds and markets single-family homes, said it sold 
its California and Texas operating divisions to Sun Valley-based Verit 
Industries for an undisclosed amount. Emerald, which is believed to have had 
close ties with embattled Phoenix businessman Charles H. Keating Jr., said it 
will continue home-building operations in the depressed Arizona market.

CARR, MARCIAN OF FIRST EXECUTIVE TO BE RE-SUBPOENAED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee has vowed to 
re-subpoena next week Fred Carr and Doug Marcian, two top officers of Los 
Angeles-based Executive Life Insurance Co., after their legal challenge to the 
committee's original summons. 
</P>
<P>
However, the committee is unsure whether it will make a second attempt to get 
Michael Milken, the indicted junk bond trader, to appear as originally 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
Milken has said he intends to invoke his Constitutional rights against self 
incrimination and not answer any questions. 
</P>
<P>
Carr and Marcian will apparently comply with the new subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if a (legal) subpoena is issued, we will comply," said the 
company's general counsel, William Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, Carr and Marcian were subpoenaed last month to testify at insurance 
hearings involving the health of Executive Life, which insures the lives and 
pensions of at least 100,000 Californians. Carr is chairman and chief executive 
of First Executive Corp., Executive Life's parent company, and Marcian is the 
company's chief investment officer. 
</P>
<P>
Executive is one of the nation's biggest investors in the high-risk, high-yield 
junk bonds once promoted by Milken. The insurance committee is investigating 
whether junk bonds are too risky for insurance companies and whether California 
needs a guarantee fund for life insurance policyholders. The state is among 
only six that do not formally protect holders of life insurance policies from 
losses, said Committee Chairman Patrick Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
Carr's attorneys objected to the Assembly's original subpoena on technical 
grounds and asked why the Assembly didn't invite the executives to attend 
before sending the subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
The committee then "invited" Carr and Marcian, who declined, saying they feared 
that adverse publicity generated by such a hearing would harm the company. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnston considers Carr and Marcian vital witnesses, so the drama 
continues.

WESTERN UNION SAYS IT MAY FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</P>

<P>
Western Union said Wednesday that it may default on interest payments due June 
15 and that it might seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy 
law. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Western Union said it 
must work out a favorable restructuring of its debts and raise funds by selling 
property or making a new public offering. 
</P>
<P>
But the company added that it has exhausted available bank credit and already 
has put up much of its remaining assets to secure loans and meet pension-plan 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Western Union said, the sale of its microwave network should 
be completed this year, and it is continuing to consolidate operations and trim 
costs -- moves that it said should pay off eventually if it can overcome its 
cash deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The filing is the latest installment in a seven-year history of hard times that 
have plagued the company formed by investors 139 years ago to string telegraph 
lines across the United States.

AT&amp;T INCREASES ITS DIVIDEND FOR 1ST TIME SINCE DIVESTITURE IN 1984

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Wednesday that its board raised the 
company's quarterly dividend to 33 cents per share from 30 cents -- the first 
time AT&amp;T has lifted its payout since the Bell System was broken up in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Robert E. Allen said the increase reflects the company's confidence 
that 1990 "will be another year of revenue and profit growth." 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock, the most widely held in the United States, rose 12.5 cents 
to close at $41.875 a share. AT&amp;T has 2.6 million registered shareholders 
and 1.1 billion shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The higher quarterly dividend is payable May 1 to shareholders of record March 
30. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T set an annual dividend of $1.20 when it divested its seven regional 
Bell telephone companies in 1984. Since then, it has faced long-distance 
competition from newcomers to the business, such as MCI Communications Corp. 
and US Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T Vice Chairman Morris Tanenbaum said last week that the 
telecommunications giant, whose long-distance market share declined to about 
66% in 1989 from about 90% at divestiture, will work to stem the erosion.

A subsidiary of Union Carbide Corp. will sell a specialty chemical business to 
Hoechst Celanese Corp., a West German firm, for an undisclosed price, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Union Carbide Chemicals &amp; Plastics Co. said it has reached an agreement to 
sell its primary alcohol ethoxylates, or PAEs, business. 
</P>
<P>
PAEs are agents used to make household products such as laundry detergents and 
cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition will include inventories and associated business technology, 
although no manufacturing facilities, property or personnel are included in the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Union Carbide, which makes PAEs at a Texas City, Tex., petrochemical complex, 
said it would continue production for Hoechst Celanese under a multiyear 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
W. E. Shackelford, a Union Carbide vice president, said the sale would allow 
the company's industrial chemicals division to focus full attention on other 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Union Carbide Chemicals &amp; Plastics makes specialty chemicals and plastics 
sold throughout the world. Hoechst Celanese makes chemicals, fibers, film and 
other materials worth about $6 billion in sales.

GLOBAL TRADE GROWTH SLOWS DURING YEAR

Global trade hit a record $3.1-trillion last year, but it grew less rapidly 
than in the previous year and seems set to slow further in 1990, the world 
trade forum GATT said in a preliminary estimate Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The United States regained its place as the world's leading exporter after 
three years in second place behind West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Japan retained third position. 
</P>
<P>
Trade volume in 1989 rose by an estimated 7%, compared to 8.5% in 1988, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Although this was enough to push the total above $3 trillion for the first 
time, the rise in value at 7.5% was almost half the rise of 14% in 1988, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
GATT added that the outlook for 1990 was generally optimistic with no world 
recession in sight. 
</P>
<P>
But economic growth was expected to slow in advanced nations to just under 3%, 
and the rise in trade volume could ease to between 5% and 6%. Even that rate 
would equal or exceed trade performance in seven of the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The forecasts were part of a report by the secretariat of the 96-nation General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade based on data available in late February. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted the value of world trade was below $2 trillion as recently as 
1985, and the 7% volume increase in 1989 was the third largest during the 
1980s.

HOTEL OCCUPANCY RATE DIPS TO ITS LOWEST POINT IN MORE THAN A DECADE; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: SLUMP IS ONE OF SEVERAL LACKLUSTER INDICATORS FOR SAN DIEGO TOURISM 
RECORDED IN JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The average occupancy rate of San Diego County hotels dipped to 53.7% in 
January, the lowest level in more than a decade, as the local hospitality 
market continues to feel the effects of a five-year boom in local hotel 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The softening of the local hotel market was just one of the several lackluster 
tourism indicators for January released Wednesday by the San Diego Convention 
&amp; Visitors Bureau (ConVis). Total visitors to the area declined 1.1% from 
the January 1989 total, visitors to the San Diego Zoo declined by 12.3% from 
the previous January and traffic at the Cabrillo National Monument was down 
nearly 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Border crossings at San Ysidro and Otay Mesa were up only 0.2%, a reflection of 
growing disenchantment by tourists with the long lines on both the U.S. and 
Mexico sides of the border, ConVis vice president Al Reese said Wednesday. Air 
passenger arrivals were up by 3.4% from January 1989, and visitor spending 
increased by 3.5% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
January's countywide hotel occupancy rate, down from the 57.2% average for 
January 1989, was the lowest since ConVis began monitoring hotel occupancy in 
1979, Reese said. "It's not a very cheery picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The softening of the hotel market is a direct result of the addition of 11,000 
hotel rooms, a 37% increase, to the countywide hotel room inventory since the 
end of 1985, a boom that has lifted the county's room total to more than 
40,000, ConVis research manager Lynn Mohrfeld said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
One benefit of the local glut in hotel rooms is that the resulting competition 
among hotel operators for guests has kept average daily room rates in the 
$75-per-night range over the last two years, Mohrfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown San Diego in particular has witnessed a spate of hotel building, and 
downtown rooms tripled, from 2,500 in 1983 to 7,500 in 1989, Reese said. The 
new construction has been spurred by the anticipated opening of the San Diego 
Convention Center, which became fully operational in January. 
</P>
<P>
But Ron Berger, General Manager of Marriott Suites-Symphony Towers, which 
opened its doors in January, was pessimistic that the convention center can by 
itself create enough added demand to cure the glut. That's because the 
twin-tower, 1,365-room San Diego Marriott hotel next to the center can 
accommodate about 75% of all convention visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not that much overflow for other hotels," Berger said, whose 
all-suites hotel opened in January. "There are way too many hotel rooms for the 
amount of business coming into the area." 
</P>
<P>
Another discouraging statistic for local hoteliers was that hotel room nights 
sold in all of January actually declined by 0.1% from the previous year, 
despite the opening of the convention center, a sign that hotel room demand was 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both the zoo and for Sea World, which saw attendence drop 11.6% 
in January from the same month the previous year, said six days of rain in 
January was the primary reason that attendance fell.

COUNCIL PANEL OKS MEASURES ON GAS BUILDUP; 
</P>
<P>
METHANE: TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AIMED AT PREVENTING ANOTHER EXPLOSION 
IN THE FAIRFAX DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key committee of the Los Angeles City Council has approved emergency measures 
to try to prevent another dangerous buildup of underground gas at a 
methane-plagued intersection in the Fairfax District. 
</P>
<P>
"We know where the gas will migrate, and we know how strong the pressure is. 
The only thing we don't know is when it will blow again," said Joseph W. 
Cobarrubias, a city geologist who briefed the committee Tuesday on his 
investigation of the latest gas scare at the corner of 3rd Street and Ogden 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection has been the site of two major gas leaks in recent years, 
including the 1985 explosion and fire that injured 24 people in the Ross Dress 
for Less store. 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident occurred in February, 1989, when methane appeared in nearly 
explosive concentrations in the basement of a K mart store on the south side of 
3rd Street. The same day, a fountain of gas, water and mud also popped up 
through a crack in a parking lot near the Gilmore Bank on the north side of the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the report of a task force headed by Cobarrubias, the Budget and 
Finance Committee agreed to adopt his recommendations and instructed him to 
prepare to implement them. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the committee chairman, 
said it was a "foregone conclusion" that the City Council would approve the 
task force's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we talking here about a dangerous situation, potentially?" Yaroslavsky 
asked during the geologist's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Cobarrubias said. 
</P>
<P>
"Very dangerous?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. . . . As soon as it hits a crack in a foundation, it can spread and fill 
an entire room." 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty scary. . . . Are you telling me then that somebody's pilot light 
or lit cigar could cause it to explode?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, or a light switch." 
</P>
<P>
Cobarrubias said nearby residential areas are not at risk, because lawns and 
gardens allow methane seeping from the ground to dissipate harmlessly. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that the acres of asphalt and concrete in the commercial district 
along 3rd Street act as a cap that prevents the methane from dissipating. 
</P>
<P>
"Nature's been doing this for a million years, and it's been safe until man 
plunked down this pavement," Cobarrubias said. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection of 3rd and Ogden sits atop a pocket of compressed sand about 
42 feet below the surface, where the gas gathers at unusually high pressures -- 
from 20 to 27 pounds per square inch, compared with 4 psi for the rest of the 
Fairfax area, according to Cobarrubias. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the gas is the subject of a pending lawsuit filed by victims of 
the 1985 Ross fire. Their attorneys blame the operators of a nearby oil field, 
but Cobarrubias said his task force found no evidence to justify that claim. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the source, the task force was more concerned with preventing 
another explosion, recommending a variety of measures. The committee adopted 
them in principle and indicated that the necessary money would be made 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations were: 
</P>
<P>
* Installation of venting wells on a 500-foot-long swatch of private property 
extending north and south from 3rd Street. The task force urged that the city 
do the job, but the council committee decided to require the landowners to do 
it. Yaroslavsky said this would relieve the city of liability if anything went 
wrong and noted that property owners had contributed to the problem by paving 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
* Installation by the city of a system of trenches and vents beneath the 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
* The assignment of additional inspectors to enforce existing requirements for 
gas detectors and other safety devices in commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The wells on the private property could cost about $60,000, which would be 
split among the owners of the Farmers Market, the Town and Country Shopping 
Center and the Park Labrea Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Hilty, president of the A. F. Gilmore Co., which owns the Gilmore Bank and 
the adjacent Farmers Market, said he found the decision "about right," 
considering that the city intends to do similar work on the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the fears is, if you protect your own property, would the gas still be 
a problem with the street, so I think this answers that," Hilty said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's costs would amount to about $70,000, but officials said that state 
funds were expected to cover most of that. 
</P>
<P>
The committee touched briefly on proposals for major commercial developments at 
the Farmers Market and at the Park Labrea complex. Any new project would be 
required to install sophisticated anti-methane systems, but neither requirement 
is expected to get through the city planning process for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is of the essence here," Yaroslavsky said, urging that the methane-safety 
measures be implemented quickly. "Maybe we have four years. Maybe we have four 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS 
</P>
<P>
* Installation of venting wells on a 500-foot-long swatch of private property 
extending north and south from 3rd Street. The task force urged that the city 
do the job, but the council committee decided to require the landowners to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
* Installation of a system of trenches and vents beneath the intersection of 
3rd Street and Ogden Drive. 
</P>
<P>
* The assignment of additional inspectors to enforce existing requirements for 
gas detectors and other safety devices in commercial buildings.

DISAPPOINTED AREA CENSUS TAKERS RARELY SAW HOMELESS THEY SOUGHT 
</P>

<P>
An unprecedented effort to count the nation's homeless appears to have turned 
up dramatically low numbers in Long Beach and other Southeast cities, where the 
counters sometimes outnumbered the counted, census takers said. 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau officials said city-by-city results of the historic count would 
not be released for several weeks and they refused to venture a guess. But the 
disillusionment of census takers hired for the night indicated that the 14-hour 
attempt to take "a snapshot" of a national crisis had yielded scarcely a 
glimpse, either because the homeless don't exist or the Census Bureau failed to 
find them. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't even see a stray dog," census taker Julie Whitmore, who is herself 
homeless, said after trudging through Whittier parks looking for anyone curled 
up on a bench or sleeping beneath a bush. 
</P>
<P>
A wide sweep of the Long Beach coastline near Redondo Avenue by two workers 
swinging their flashlights in the mist revealed nothing but an expanse of wet 
sand. A walk around an abandoned building on one of the empty streets of 
downtown turned up only an empty sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
It was as though the streets had been purposely emptied, some of the census 
teams lamented at the end of their 14-hour search of alleys, freeway 
underpasses, abandoned buildings, emergency shelters and cheap motels from dusk 
Tuesday to dawn Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some census officials suspected the police conspired to chase street people 
away and minimize the homeless crisis with a low count. Some blamed the 
homeless themselves for taking part in a national census boycott. But many more 
faulted the U.S. Census Bureau for employing too few people to look in all the 
wrong places for a population that hides from authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We all encounter the homeless in our daily lives and there seemed to be fewer 
on the streets than there usually are," said Susan Silberstein, a supervisor at 
the Long Beach census office. "I suspect the police moved people. Possibly the 
city would rather not be identified as having a large homeless population," she 
added, reflecting the opinion of several census takers. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeless people said they were rousted by police in the night. But Long 
Beach Police Lt. Columbus Lowe dismissed the idea as absurd. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth to that," he said. "We have no stake in whether they count 
people or not." 
</P>
<P>
About 200 census takers were deployed in teams to cover territory from Long 
Beach to Compton to Santa Fe Springs in two shifts. Critics said such a small 
number couldn't hope to find hidden pockets of homelessness in an area so vast. 
</P>
<P>
One team of three men and a woman straggled into Long Beach headquarters at 7 
a.m. Wednesday reporting that in six hours they had counted fewer than 10 
people. They said a visit to the Greyhound bus station, expected to be a gold 
mine, turned up one homeless man. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously weren't where they were," census taker Bill Davies said. "I just 
feel the government in general was directed to get as low a count as possible. 
That way the public isn't going to raise a hue and cry about just a couple of 
thousand homeless people." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance was uneven at area shelters, where census takers visited as part of 
their first-shift tour from dusk to midnight. Handouts of polyester shirts and 
hygiene kits with soap, deodorant and candy helped attract a full house to the 
National Guard Armory in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But an outbreak of measles and chicken pox had depleted the capacity crowd 
usually in residence at the nearby Family Shelter from 50 to nine, director 
Lupe Macker said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible timing," she said. "It just seems like you couldn't find 
another thing to work against this. It hasn't gone smoothly at all." 
</P>
<P>
The second shift's task was more difficult -- finding homeless people under 
bridges, in parks, alleys and some of the county's meanest streets. There were 
no violent incidents reported and few workers even complained of danger. The 
biggest letdown was the count itself, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a really enthusiastic group, people who couldn't wait to get out there 
and start counting. They were really fired up," Silberstein said. "But when 
they came back, they were disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau had asked cities weeks ago to come up with an itinerary of 
places the homeless are known to congregate. Critics warned it was misguided to 
rely on bureaucrats for such information rather than the homeless and their 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Marine patrol officers and poverty workers said they offered to direct census 
takers to spots frequented by the homeless and the mentally ill, but the offer 
was refused. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates warned that a low count is worse than no count at all, since the 
census number will probably be used for years to determine government aid to 
social welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to be low, but now we're concerned it will be even 
lower," Long Beach Homeless Coordinator Sheila Pagnani said. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 p.m. it was clear at the Salvation Army shelter in Bell that the homeless 
were not embracing the idea of a census. Attendance was slightly less than 
usual, and some who were there refused to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a bunch of crap," said Keith Robinson, who has been homeless since 
1985. "It ain't going to help me. Tomorrow, I'm back on the road again." 
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters the county opens only when the temperature drops to 40 were 
beckoning street people to take shelter in almost balmy weather Tuesday night. 
Because the county has refused in the past to bend the rules even when the 
temperature hits 41, some of the homeless were bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"We done had some bad nights here this year and some bad days, and the armory 
wasn't open," complained a drunken man at the Long Beach armory who wouldn't 
give his name. "Now we have 90-degree weather at night and the armory is open. 
. . . We're being counted tonight for what? For dollars, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
But others at the armory, where the air reeked of alcohol and an occasional 
whiff of body lotion from a hygiene kit, were eager to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be counted. I've never been counted before. I wanted to be one of 
the people of the United States," Donald DeWitt, 37, said, sitting on an Army 
cot. 
</P>
<P>
A city-appointed task force put the Long Beach homeless population between 
3,000 and 5,000, an estimate that has since been disputed as too high by some 
and too low by others. 
</P>
<P>
It was doubtful by dawn Wednesday that the first-ever census had settled the 
debate or put a reliable number on the nation's despair. 
</P>
<P>
The scene at a park behind Long Beach City Hall, where street people were 
beginning to gather early Wednesday, seemed to sum it up. 
</P>
<P>
Three homeless men were sitting in the morning sun. One of them had been 
counted. Two had not. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't crazy about it," 68-year-old Melvin Behning said of his census 
experience at the local rescue mission. "I really had hoped to avoid it, but I 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
James Hutchinson, 63, said he been among the city's homeless for 12 years, but 
no one stumbled on him sleeping behind a downtown liquor store Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Banda, 53, spent the night in his car. But no one looked there, either, he 
said.

JEWISH TUTORS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bureau of Jewish Education is seeking trained tutors to help the children 
of Soviet Jewish immigrants with their schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesperson for the bureau, more than 1,700 Soviet Jews settled 
in Los Angeles in 1989, and 3,000 more are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrant parents do not usually speak English, and their children 
typically need help with both their English- and Hebrew-language studies. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau, at 6505 Wilshire Blvd., is the educational arm of the Jewish 
Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. It provides services to 25,000 
students in Jewish schools and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
Only skilled tutors are sought because no training is available. 
</P>
<P>
Children to be tutored range in age from 5 to 18. 
</P>
<P>

MOUNTAINGATE PLAN REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council denied a developer's request to add 165 new homes 
to the Mountaingate development near Sepulveda Pass. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-0 vote Tuesday came after Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the 
area, said that the threat of methane gas from a nearby landfill has not been 
ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
H. R. Stoke, a representative of the developer, Barclay-Hollander-Curci 
Inc./Oceanic Calif. Inc., asked for six months to gather more information about 
the state of the landfill, which was closed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the file in this matter that indicates the safety of the 
canyon is in doubt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the City Council went along with the recommendation of Braude, the Planning 
Commission and residents' groups, which urged that the developer be required to 
come back with a new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point no one is certain how to close a landfill safely," Braude said.

CRIME UP 11.5% THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sharp jump in vehicle burglaries led to an 11.5% increase in crime at Marina 
del Rey during the first two months of the year, according to the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, 126 serious crimes had been reported in the 
county-owned marina this year, up from 113 in the first two months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The number of vehicle burglaries at the marina shot up 35%, from 62 cases in 
January and February of last year to 84 in the same period this year. The 
increase was particularly dramatic in February. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ray Sanchez, head of the Marina Sheriff's Station, told the county's 
Small Craft Harbor Commission last week that he had no explanation for the 
surge in vehicle burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
The number of rape, assault, and burglary cases in the marina was unchanged, 
while the number of robberies dropped by more than half. Car thefts were also 
down.

BUILDING RENOVATION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved the renovation of a city-owned office building 
despite opposition from some residents. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story building, at 7362 Santa Monica Blvd., will require $208,759 in 
improvements, including fire sprinklers and an elevator. The city recently 
bought the building for $426,000. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the council decided to rent the first floor to the city-supported 
Adult Day Health Care Center. The second floor was set aside for office space.

CLINIC KEEPS GIVING THE GIFT OF GOOD MEDICINE; 
</P>
<P>
VENICE: A HEALTH-CARE CLINIC THAT OPENED 20 YEARS AGO FOR WHAT WAS HOPED WOULD 
BE A SHORT TIME IS STILL OPEN. IN FACT, IT HAS JUST EXPANDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE ANA BERBEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Venice Family Clinic opened its doors 20 years ago, its founders hoped 
they would soon be out of business. Instead it has expanded and grown beyond 
anyone's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic initially was founded to appease a group of Venice residents who 
were angry about the lack of affordable health care and the scarcity of doctors 
in the area, according to Dr. Mayer Davidson, one of the founders. It is now 
the family doctor for thousands of homeless, working poor and unemployed people 
and is bigger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, it should have gone out of business. Everyone should have affordable 
health care," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
But demand for its services have grown, and in response the clinic opened a 
newly expanded Venice facility March 19 to accommodate thousands of additional 
patient visits. 
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-square-foot, $3-million expansion adjoining the existing building at 
604 Rose Ave. triples the size of the facility, and will allow it to handle 
15,000 more patient visits a year for a total of about 45,000 a year, Executive 
Director Fern Seizer said. 
</P>
<P>
The white, airy rooms of the new two-story building house office space, a large 
waiting room, examination rooms, counseling rooms, a dispensary and a full 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will probably increase the clinic's annual operating budget from 
$2 million to about $3 million, Seizer said. Eighty percent of the budget comes 
from private donations, she said, including the proceeds of the annual Venice 
Art Walk, a foot tour of Venice artists' homes and studios. 
</P>
<P>
Although it will be difficult to come up with the additional money needed to 
operate the expanded facility, Seizer said, it is badly needed. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least 5,000 people were turned away because of lack of room to 
treat them, she said. "Many get discouraged because we're so crowded," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic's patients are a poor, uninsured population. About 92% have incomes 
below the poverty level -- $12,000 a year for a family of four -- and 94% have 
no health insurance, Seizer said. 
</P>
<P>
Most uninsured patients depend on county facilities for medical treatment, but 
those facilities have also become crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Even those people who can afford private care could have difficulty finding it 
in the Venice area, where the doctor shortage that prompted Davidson and others 
to found the clinic has not changed much. The Venice Family Clinic offers an 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers can make same-day appointments for their children to get shots, 
prescriptions, or an examination. Walk-in appointments are available to the 
homeless who need medical treatment or counseling. Seniors can get eyeglasses. 
All of the services are given on a free or pay-what-you-can basis. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for these services sometimes means a long wait in the clinic's 
crowded lobby. Some patients come from as far away as downtown and 
South-Central Los Angeles, Seizer said. Despite the obstacles, the clinic for 
many has become the family doctor that will take care of most of their medical 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
When a patient has a medical problem the clinic cannot handle, the patient is 
referred to one of several hospitals -- Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, St. 
John's Hospital, and Los Angeles County-UCLA Medical Center -- that provide 
free services arranged for at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, the clinic's waiting room was warm and noisy, 
with mothers and children waiting to be seen for same-day appointments, and 
homeless men and women who had come in on a walk-in basis. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Ramirez, 3, clung to her mother's knees as the two waited to be seen. 
Andrea had a fever and an ear infection, her mother, Rosalia, said in Spanish. 
Her work as a maid does not provide medical insurance for her and her two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming here for 10 years," Ramirez said. "At times we can get 
Medi-Cal, at times we can't. Sometimes I take the children to other clinics or 
doctors, but they're expensive or don't accept Medi-Cal. Here, you have to 
wait, but they treat you well. And they give good, effective medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's case is not unusual, Seizer said. Many families depend on the clinic 
sporadically for years. According to statistics compiled by the clinic's 
directors, Latinos make up a majority of the patients, many of them recent 
immigrants who work low-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
One crucial service the clinic provides is free medical care for the homeless, 
who make up about 27% of the patients, both on a walk-in basis and through 
outreach teams that make weekly visits to nearby homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
At one of these shelters, the Bible Tabernacle church in Venice, about 150 
homeless women and children bed down every night on the sanctuary's benches and 
floors, according to Director Mark Hilst. 
</P>
<P>
Every Tuesday evening, the clinic's coordinator of services for the homeless, 
Diane Foray, brings a doctor, a psychologist or social worker, a nurse 
practitioner, and one or two other volunteers to the church. They set up tables 
and screens in the church basement and examine or treat whoever needs help. In 
two hours, they may see 15 patients, some for the first time, some for 
follow-up treatment after previous examinations at the church or clinic, Foray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the families at the shelter suffer from poor health, said nurse 
practitioner Mary Smith, who has volunteered her time at the clinic for the 
past six years. "They may not have enough clothes, so they catch a cold. Here 
it's like a family. When one person catches a cold, everyone else does," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children, many from abusive or otherwise dysfunctional families, 
suffer from mental health problems expressed through sleep disturbances, 
anxiety and thumb-sucking, Smith said. Because the clinic is not a formal 
mental-health agency, it treats the mentally ill mainly through diagnosis and 
referral to county facilities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the best help the workers can give is to listen. "They very often 
just want to unload. They want someone to listen to them and treat them with 
kindness," said psychologist Joanne Jubelier, who has a regular practice in 
Beverly Hills but volunteers her time at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"The people I see in private practice have the resources to take their kid to 
be diagnosed, or to see their physician. These families don't have the 
resources to even identify their needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Krystal Gregory, 27, said she came to the Bible Tabernacle for shelter after 
her mother and 4-month-old boy died, leaving her depressed and dependent on her 
father, with whom she didn't get along. She didn't have a husband, and had 
recently gotten out of the Army. "I was never independent before. I was 
suicidal, I was crying out for help," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory got medication for a cough and skin rash from the clinic, along with 
some compassionate counseling, she said. 
</P>
<P>

BRUIN CATCHER PUMPS UP BATTING AVERAGE AND CHANCE FOR THE MAJORS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: PAUL ELLIS SHOULD HAVE THE ATTENTION OF PROS WITH A STRONGER THROWING 
ARM AND POWER AT THE PLATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When UCLA catcher Paul Ellis was a senior at San Ramon Valley High School he 
was not drafted by a major league team, probably because it was thought he 
didn't have a strong throwing arm. 
</P>
<P>
He has now -- along with a few other things that should assure him of a big 
league career. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't a lot of catchers who can catch," said UCLA Coach Gary Adams. 
"Paul can catch and throw, and when you've got someone who can catch and throw, 
is a hitter and hits left-handed, you've got yourself quite a commodity right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said that Ellis wasn't drafted "out of high school because professional 
scouts didn't feel his arm was strong enough." He added that the junior 
catcher's arm has become strong because of "maturity and practice. He always 
had a quick release, he gets rid of the ball fast and is tough to steal on." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis has also been tough on college pitchers this season. As of last week, he 
had 14 home runs and 41 runs batted in for 28 games. He has led the nation for 
NCAA Division IA. That's quite a switch. 
</P>
<P>
As a regular last year, though he missed most of the Bruins' last 13 games 
because of a shoulder injury, he still managed to start 32 games but finished 
the year with only 23 RBIs. And before this season, he had hit just five homers 
in two years at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
How does Ellis, who hit .281 in his first two years at UCLA and is batting .347 
this year, explain his turnaround in hitting? He doesn't -- at least not very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not doing anything real different mechanically, but I am being a little 
bit more aggressive at the plate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he has also received some help on batting from retired Pepperdine 
Coach Dave Gorrie and from UCLA assistant Vince Beringhele, a former Bruin 
center fielder who was a good hitter in college. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't hurt him either that he has been batting in the fourth or fifth spot 
of the order behind Chris Pritchett. The sophomore first baseman from Merced is 
batting a team-high .376 with eight homers and 30 RBIs. Opponents have had a 
difficult time pitching around both Pritchett and Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said that UCLA pitching Coach Tip Lefebvre, brother of Seattle Mariners' 
Manager Jim Lefebvre, has helped him improve his mechanics as a catcher, 
including his throwing. 
</P>
<P>
But he also thinks that his throwing has improved since he injured his right 
shoulder when a runner ran into him at home plate last year. He said his arm 
became stronger and more accurate because of exercises prescribed by Dr. Frank 
Jobe. 
</P>
<P>
Because he has become a power hitter, opposing pitchers have begun to give him 
the kind of respect they do to batters that they fear: They are walking him 
(often intentionally), pitching him away and paying him the ultimate compliment 
of throwing at him. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 games before last Saturday, Ellis drew 10 walks, six of them intentional. 
</P>
<P>
He has been hit by pitches three times, once in the meaty part of his right arm 
and twice in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
His batting average has dropped about 20 points because, he said, "I am 
starting to hit their pitches instead of mine. I am getting a little 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Not as frustrated perhaps as Coach Adams, whose team is only 4-7 (19-9 overall) 
in the tough Pacific 10 Conference and is suffering through a rash of injuries 
to what had otherwise been a strong pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out to be one of our best pitching staffs," Adams said, "but I've 
got more guys hurt than I've got healthy right now." 
</P>
<P>
Among the injured hurlers are sophomore Tony Darden, junior Mike Fyhrie , 
freshman Pete Janicki, sophomore Adam Schulhofer, freshman Kurt Schwengel and 
senior John Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
Fyhrie and Sutherland, two of UCLA's best starters, are scheduled to have 
surgery next week -- Fyhrie on his elbow and Sutherland for a torn rotator cuff 
-- and may not return in time to pitch any more this season. 
</P>
<P>
So if Ellis doesn't see any good pitches the rest of the way , and, if Coach 
Adams can't use a lot of his good pitchers, will UCLA possibly earn a berth in 
the NCAA playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
Adams and Ellis both think so. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bruins are struggling in conference play, Adams said that UCLA has 
beaten "a lot of tough teams" outside the conference, including Illinois, Cal 
State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton, Loyola Marymount, Pepperdine, UC Irvine 
and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can finish third or fourth (in the Pac-10), with the record we would 
have against good teams, we can be selected" for the NCAA playoffs, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said: "We still have a chance. Things don't look as good as they did at 
the beginning of the year. But some of our young guys are improving. They're 
getting better with every game." 
</P>
<P>
If UCLA does not make the NCAA this year, it will probably be Ellis' last crack 
at a national collegiate championship. He hopes to sign with a major league 
team after he completes his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
Does he have a good chance to make it in the big leagues? Adams and Ellis both 
think so. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said that the 6-foot 2-inch, 195-pound catcher's prospects "are just as 
bright as" those of former UCLA catchers Don Slaught, Billy Haselman and Todd 
Zeile. Slaught is with the Pittsburgh Pirates after tours with the Texas 
Rangers and New York Yankees. Haselman is expected to play for Texas this year. 
Zeile is with the St. Louis Cardinals and is considered a strong candidate to 
garner some rookie honors this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis also likes his prospects, but he says he doesn't want "to spend my life 
in the minors. If I'm 25 or 26 and still in the (rookie leagues), I would 
probably get out of baseball because the writing is on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you're moving up every year, you have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis has used wooden bats, the kind employed in the major leagues, in practice 
and in tournaments, and he thinks he can make the transition from the aluminum 
bats of college baseball to wood. 
</P>
<P>
He said that a wooden bat "doesn't have as big a sweet spot as an aluminum bat 
and you have more bat speed with aluminum. I'll find out whether I'm a good 
hitter or not. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you hit (the ball) right with a wooden bat, it will go as far as it 
will with aluminum." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said that Ellis "can make the transition. Strong kids can do that, and he 
has the strength." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis thinks he has the patience to put in the next few years trying to become 
a major leaguer and plans to give it everything he has. 
</P>
<P>
"I like baseball a lot," he said. "It's you against the other guy and seeing 
how you do. But there's also the team part of it, and being out there with all 
your friends." 
</P>
<P>
Of course it's also being out there with all your enemies -- especially the 
pitchers who think your batting helmet has a bull's-eye painted on it. 
</P>

FISHING NOTES: TWO HALIBUT DERBIES WILL BRIGHTEN THE SPRING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's nothing like halibut derbies to set the pace for spring fishing. 
</P>
<P>
The first of two local derbies is this weekend with the 16th annual Marina del 
Rey contest. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing will begin at 5 a.m. Saturday and continue until the weigh-in station 
closes at 5 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing area is restricted to five miles offshore between Pt. Vicente and 
Pt. Dume. 
</P>
<P>
The halibut-only derby is a charity event in conjunction with the Marina del 
Rey Anglers and the Boys Scouts of America Western Los Angeles Council. Entry 
fees will be equally divided among the Boy Scouts and youth fishing and marine 
conservation projects. 
</P>
<P>
The grand prize for biggest fish will be a trip for two to the Great Barrier 
Reef in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Second prize will be a trip for two to Alaska to fish for giant halibut and 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Other prizes will be provided by tackle companies and landings. 
</P>
<P>
All derby entrants will be automatically entered into a special prize drawing 
at the awards banquet April 5. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lambert, derby chairman, is encouraging anglers to use only single hooks 
and 14-pound test line, and to carefully release all short fish. 
</P>
<P>
Entry is limited to 1,200 anglers. Lambert said a few spots remain open. Late 
applications may be taken to the derby headquarters at Pardee Scout Base, 13640 
Mindanao Way in Marina del Rey. The entry fee is $35. 
</P>
<P>
The next derby will be the Santa Monica Halibut Derby on April 7-8. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Vasi of Redondo Beach, fishing at King Harbor breakwater on the incoming 
tide, was soaking an anchovy on the bottom when he had a strike and brought up 
a halibut. Vasi weighed it in at the pier at 11 1/4 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Beck of San Pedro and Curt Cubito of Harbor City returned from a 16-day 
fishing trip to Mexico aboard the Polaris. Beck won a jackpot with a 220-pound 
yellowfin tuna. Cubito also won a jackpot with a 156-pound, 9-ounce yellowfin. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Tim Weaver of Long Beach, fishing at San Clemente Island 
aboard the Outerlimits, used 50-pound test line and a squid-baited jig to catch 
the whopper of the week, a 41-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Blackjack at Cherry Bank, 
won the jackpot with his 32-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Mosley of West Los Angeles, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern 
Cal, caught a 28-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Mossman of Carson, fishing at Rocky Point aboard the Redondo Special, won 
the jackpot with a 30-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Makasuka of Santa Monica, fishing at San Clemente Island aboard the 
Toronado, caught a 18-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: The local bait situation improved the past several days with 
haulers finding bait for the halibut derby. 
</P>
<P>
Island fishing with squid continues to be excellent with a variety of rockfish 
and some white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the rock reefs and anglers 
sacked 315 sculpin and five halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman on a half-day trip to the bay returned with 16 halibut and 10 
sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished the shallow rock areas off Rocky 
Point and chalked up 315 rock cod, five halibut and one lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special on a half-day trip returned with 180 sculpin and 50 shallow 
water rockfish. 
</P>

<P>
The Freedom trip to Catalina resulted in a variety catch -- 160 blue perch, 53 
sheephead, 34 whitefish, 11 sculpin and one cabazon. 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Outerlimits worked San Clemente and Catalina

HARTLEY AN OLD ROOKIE BATTLING SPRING CLOCK 
</P>

Mike Hartley figured this would be a spring to remember. This spring, he was 
finally going to be able to forget. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the bus that broke down in a south Georgia hollow in the middle of the 
night, finally dropping him and his minor league teammates at a game 17 hours 
later. Forget pitching a minor league game before five people, three of whom 
were family. Forget the screaming match with the minor league manager, even 
though Hartley knew the manager was right. 
</P>
<P>
And forget the fights with himself that brought alcohol binges followed by 
games in which he learned that pitching with men on base is easy compared to 
pitching with a hangover. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Mike Hartley, 28, after eight seasons in the minor leagues, was 
going to make the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"And now look at it," Hartley said earlier this week, disgust in his voice as 
he sat in the back row of a San Diego flight bound for Florida. "Now I don't 
know how much chance I have." 
</P>
<P>
To officials who said that the recently ended 32-day owners' lockout was 
necessary for a successful baseball future, Hartley poses one question: Whose 
future? 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when he was recalled to the major leagues in September, his 
fastball froze the first 12 batters he faced. In six innings, he allowed only 
two hits with one earned run -- and just in time. The Dodgers were looking for 
a hard-throwing right-handed relief pitcher to set up Jay Howell and, possibly, 
Jim Gott. 
</P>
<P>
"This was going to be my year," Hartley said. "Finally, my year." 
</P>
<P>
But a baseball season includes six weeks of spring training with long, humid 
March days when managers can stare at new players long enough to be sold on 
their ability to play in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
This season has already defied definition. Hartley, and many other rookies like 
him, will not have the luxury of being watched. Either they have made the team 
or they haven't. Hartley, who thought he almost had it made, is no longer sure. 
And he wonders if it's fair. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, my spring training was wrecked with a pulled groin," Hartley said. 
"This year, the lockout. It's the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I support my union; I think we did the right thing. It's just sometimes, I 
feel torn apart." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda promised that Hartley will have a chance, adding: 
"He will battle like the rest of them." 
</P>
<P>
But when Hartley entered this spring, he was different from the rest of the 
prospects. Nobody else was as old. And nobody else had aged quite the same. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley signed his first professional contract with the St. Louis Cardinals 
organization in 1982 at 21 despite not having played serious baseball since his 
freshman year in high school. He was always too busy wrestling. When he finally 
decided to pitch for his Grossmont College team in El Cajon, scouts were so 
amazed at his strength that the Cardinals signed him to a $50,000 contract 
before his first game. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching and wrestling have some things in common," he said. "I like the 
one-on-one part. In both sports, you live and die with just you." 
</P>
<P>
He spent the next five years as a 197-pound kid who could throw hard but do 
little else. To prove himself adaptable, he partied as hard as he pitched. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted to do was have a good time," he recalled. "I would go out every 
night and party all night and then get up the next day and try to pitch. I 
finally learned, it's no fun to pitch with a hangover. I got tired of going out 
there just hoping to get through the game." 
</P>
<P>
He partied so hard, he couldn't get out of Class A. He spent life riding buses 
and sleeping in cheap apartments, including one month in somebody's basement. 
Friends who had long since passed him on the ladder of success would wonder 
what he was doing with his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling him, you can't party until 2 in the morning and then play 
tennis until 4 in the morning and expect to be any good," recalled Ky Snyder, a 
San Diego financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis at 4 a.m.? "Yeah," Hartley admitted. "I was one of those guys who would 
get drunk and play tennis." 
</P>
<P>
He finally listened to his friends -- and himself -- when he missed a bus in 
1986 while playing for a Class-A team in Springfield, Ill., and had to catch a 
plane to a game in Wausau, Wis. He was fined, screamed at the manager and was 
sent down to a lower Class-A team in Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
"It was then I decided, I should at least give baseball a chance," Hartley 
said. "One more chance." 
</P>
<P>
The next season he was drafted by the Dodgers. And from Class-A Bakersfield to 
Los Angeles, he hasn't had a bad year since. Last year, before being recalled, 
he was 7-4 with a 2.79 earned-run average in 58 appearances for triple-A 
Albuquerque. He has settled down with a wife and baby and a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as focused as any player I've been around," said his agent, Dennis 
Gilbert, who signed Hartley in 1987. "When I first saw him, I could tell, 
wherever he had been before, he wasn't going back there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kevin Kennedy, Albuquerque manager: "He is fearless on the mound. When you 
bring in some relievers, you can tell if they are scared by the way they 
breathe and the way they look. Mike is just the opposite. Nothing shakes him." 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept thinking this lockout would be settled," Hartley said. "I would see 
where we were getting ready to accept their contract . . . then reject it . . . 
then accept it. It got to be, like, a joke. I sure am glad us players got what 
we wanted. I just hope I can make the team and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers more than tripled their first-day attendance Wednesday when an 
additional 20 players joined the original eight for workouts. Eight of the 
remaining 10 members of the 38-man roster were scheduled to arrive Wednesday 
night, with the first true full workout set for today. The only players who may 
not arrive until today are injured outfielders Kal Daniels and Kirk Gibson, who 
were having logistics problems. Among those also missing from Wednesday's 
workout were possible opening-day starters: second baseman Willie Randolph, 
shortstop Alfredo Griffin, third baseman Jeff Hamilton, center fielder Juan 
Samuel and right fielder Hubie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Utility player Mickey Hatcher arrived late Tuesday afternoon and noted with 
dismay that his locker had been moved to the middle of a rearranged Dodger 
clubhouse to accommodate a large roster. "So everybody who thought we weren't 
playing because of a lockout problem was wrong," Hatcher said. "It was a locker 
problem." Hatcher immediately enlisted coach Mark Cresse to pitch late batting 
practice to him. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda will have a sore right knee X-rayed today after 
injuring it a couple of days ago. . . . Some team officials are once again 
pushing for a trade that would add Philadelphia center fielder Len Dykstra, 
enabling the Dodgers to move Samuel to second base and Randolph out. But Fred 
Claire, Dodger vice president, said earlier this week that he was in no mood to 
deal. "My priority isn't trading people; I like the roster we have," Claire 
said Monday.

SANCHEZ HAS ANSWERS FOR LENDL

As he did all day long, Emilio Sanchez had an answer for Ivan Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
After Sanchez upset Lendl, 6-3, 6-7 (7-3), 6-4, Wednesday in the fourth round 
of the International Players Championships, the top player in the world said 
the Spaniard won't win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know (if I can)," Sanchez said. "He can't, for sure." 
</P>
<P>
In another major upset, Conchita Martinez of Spain knocked off top-seeded 
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, 7-6 (10-8), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl fought off three match points to bounce back from a 5-2 deficit to trail, 
5-4, in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't hold serve in the 10th game and lost to Sanchez for the first time 
in four meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"In my career, I've beaten most of the guys -- (Boris) Becker, (John) McEnroe, 
(Stefan) Edberg -- but not in the same tournament," Sanchez said. "Lendl was 
the only one that I could never beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come close many times, and today I almost let the match escape from me. 
When I had the match points and didn't win them, I kept telling myself to keep 
trying and keep fighting. If he beats me, he beats me." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said he would have preferred to have been someplace else this week 
because he usually doesn't play well in South Florida's humid weather. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt I was out of the match because I was coming back and started to 
play better," he said. "But I never felt I was in control, because when you're 
down and serving into the wind, no one can feel in control. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I come down here, it's humid and I don't feel like the ball is 
coming off the racket the way I wanted it to."

EAST REGIONAL: MORNINGSIDE PRODUCT ELDEN CAMPBELL SOMETIMES DOES IT ALL FOR 
TIGERS, WHO FACE CONNECTICUT TONIGHT.

<P>
And now, introducing the Duo of Doom, nearly 14 feet tall, laced into two pairs 
of size-15 1/2 sneakers and topped by twin flat-tops suitable for high fashion 
or possibly helicopter landings. 
</P>
<P>
But Duo of Doom? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess Twin Towers was already taken," said smiling 6-foot-11 senior center 
Elden Campbell, who has been running somewhat short of grins recently. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's high hopes of upsetting Connecticut (30-5) in tonight's East Regional 
semifinal round lean on Campbell and 6-11 forward Dale Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Will they be up to the task? If everything goes right, Campbell thinks it could 
be Doom's day. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been favored for a lot of things this year," said Campbell, from 
Morningside High School in Inglewood. "I'm lucky because I get another chance. 
I'll just go out and be a leader." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Clemson is here because the whole team got lucky against Brigham 
Young. The Tigers escaped with a 49-47 first-round victory, despite shooting 
33%, missing 16 free throws and scoring just 10 points in the first 15 minutes 
of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell ended the game with 15 points and seven rebounds, and Davis had 11 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Clemson trailed La Salle by 16 points at halftime but came back to win, 
79-75, despite shooting only 12.5% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
In that game, only one of the Duo played up to expectations. Davis came through 
with 25 points and 17 rebounds, but Campbell staggered through a seven-point, 
five-rebound, five-foul performance. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell once again heard from his critics, who said Clemson's attack was more 
like the Uno of Doom. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's failings have often been lively topics of discussion among Clemson 
faithful. When Campbell was benched for the last six minutes of the first half 
and the first three minutes of the second half in the BYU game, it did not go 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Cliff Ellis said it was no mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ever put an individual before the team," he said. "You have to do 
what's right. Elden Campbell has not been the only one on our team who's had to 
sit. But naturally, if it's in the NCAA, people notice it a little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
The most notable Clemson center since Wayne (Tree) Rollins, Campbell led the 
Tigers in scoring and blocked shots, was second in rebounding and steals, and 
was third in shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't what Campbell did that bothered his critics, it was the way he 
did it. A finesse player, Campbell plays an emotionless game that belies his 
doom-dispensing nickname. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside Coach Carl Franklin said he is not surprised Campbell caught flak 
because of his demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a real easygoing manner," Franklin said. "He makes everything look 
easy. But I never had any trouble getting him to play hard for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sensitive to the criticism," Franklin said. "We were more patient with 
him. We didn't try to pressure him so hard he burned himself out or turned him 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Oh, if they can just get him to play a little harder.' Sure, he has 
an easy manner, but that doesn't mean he doesn't play hard." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell blocked 94 shots this season, and Clemson (26-8) won its first 
Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season championship. One of Campbell's valued 
skills is that he can block shots with either hand. 
</P>
<P>
He can also score. Campbell had 20 or more points 11 times this season. Still, 
Ellis did not start Campbell on five occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Said UCLA Coach Jim Harrick, who tried to recruit Campbell for Pepperdine: 
"He's a very tough player, but he's also kind of a sleepy-eyed kid who always 
gives the impression he needs his heart jump-started." 
</P>
<P>
In the ACC tournament, Campbell was slowed by flu and strep throat, and lost 15 
pounds. Campbell said he is still recovering. 
</P>
<P>
As for sitting down against BYU, Campbell said it was "no big thing." 
</P>
<P>
And as for playing poorly against La Salle, Campbell is thankful for another 
chance against Connecticut, the surprise team of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it as a second chance for me," he said. "In the last two games, I 
really wasn't playing well, but we got lucky in the BYU game and then won 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just fortunate to have another opportunity to play like I can and not to 
have to go out on a low note." 
</P>
<P>
Against Connecticut, another low note is possible for Clemson. On paper, it is 
an intriguing match-up. The Huskies are not big, but their smothering pressure 
defense is an equalizer. Meanwhile, the Tigers are big enough, but their 
backcourt may be susceptible to pressure, and their inability to shoot 
three-pointers may be their downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is we've won 26 games this way," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
So, as Clemson seeks to upset Connecticut, Campbell tries to redeem his 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I'm capable of," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, who would not permit Campbell to attend Clemson's pregame news 
conference, said he is trying to shield the vulnerable half of the Duo of Doom 
from too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he's thinking a little bit now about the pressure, and I want to take 
part of that burden off his shoulders," Ellis said. "He's pressing himself." 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut will try to do the same thing tonight.

MIDWEST REGIONAL: XAVIER AND TEXAS BOTH HAVE TALENTED TEAMS TO GO ALONG WITH 
QUOTABLE COACHES.

<P>
Xavier basketball Coach Pete Gillen likens his team to a cure for the common 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
"We're both waiting to be discovered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The nation is quickly discovering Xavier's surprising team, which upset 
third-seeded Georgetown, 74-71, last Sunday to reach the NCAA's Sweet 16 for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier (28-4) will play Texas (23-8) in a Midwest Regional semifinal game 
tonight at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
A master motivator, Gillen made an emotional speech to his players before the 
Georgetown game, telling them not to be intimidated by the Hoyas. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a Knute Rockne speech," Gillen said. "If I give a Knute Rockne 
speech, guys are snoring and want to know who he is. Basically, I told the kids 
to believe in themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Did the Musketeers believe they could advance this far? 
</P>
<P>
"I think we worked pretty hard this year, and it's coming into play right now," 
guard Michael Davenport said. "It's just a testament that hard work pays off." 
</P>
<P>
And no one has worked harder than Gillen, who has helped transform the tiny 
Jesuit college in suburban Cincinnati into one of the nation's more successful 
basketball schools. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over in 1985, Gillen has led Xavier into the NCAA tournament the 
last five seasons. But the Musketeers didn't stick around long, as they were 
eliminated in the first round the last two years, losing to the eventual 
champions -- Kansas in 1988 and Michigan in '89. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the official hors d'oeuvres of the tournament," Gillen said. "But we 
want to change that." 
</P>
<P>
And the Musketeers have changed that. Perhaps college basketball's best-kept 
secret because of their lack of TV exposure, Xavier is getting plenty of 
attention now. 
</P>
<P>
And Gillen seems to relish the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"Tournament time is special," he said. "I've got a suite at the hotel and I 
need a map because it's bigger than my house. But you realize that we could be 
back home scrubbing the cat. When it ends, it ends with a thud. So you'd better 
enjoy it. You'd better take that little mint before you go to sleep. If you're 
in Camelot for a couple of weeks, you might as well enjoy it. Then again, my 
kids probably think Camelot is some kind of wine." 
</P>
<P>
A native New Yorker who retains his Brooklyn accent, Gillen is ever ready with 
a quip. During news conferences, he sounds as though he's auditioning for a 
comedy club. The Xavier sports information office has even compiled a four-page 
list of his best lines. 
</P>
<P>
A few Gillen one-liners: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On picking a winner of the NCAA tournament: "I haven't picked a winner 
since Moby Dick was a minnow." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On playing cross-town rival Cincinnati: "We're not eating or sleeping. 
We're like Gandhi." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On himself: "I'm just a Joe Bag of Doughnuts, Harvey Sweatsocks. I'm just 
Joe Slice of Pizza." 
</P>
<P>
Is Gillen as funny with his players as he is with the media? 
</P>
<P>
"That's Coach Gillen," forward Tyrone Hill said. "You never know what to 
expect. When there's a lot of pressure on you, he loosens you up." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the success he has enjoyed at Xavier, where he has won 20 or more 
games four times, Gillen's name pops up for coaching vacancies at other 
schools. Does Gillen plan to capitalize on his reputation to land a new job? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have much money because every three weeks I send checks to 210 writers 
that mention my name for jobs," Gillen said. "Seriously, it is flattering. It 
gets a little uncomfortable because you don't want the players to be 
distracted. I'm very happy where I'm at, but you've always got to look." 
</P>
<P>
Gillen has paid his dues. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Fairfield (Conn.) University, he began his coaching 
career at a Catholic grade school in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"I had guys on the team who hung around car washes," Gillen said. "They had 
scars on their head. They were like dead-end kids. Guys who live at the end of 
blocks with no shoes." 
</P>
<P>
After two years at the grade school, Gillen was hired as the freshman coach at 
his alma mater, Brooklyn Prep. Two years later, he was elevated to coaching the 
varsity, which he guided to a 31-11 mark. After the school closed because of 
financial troubles, he left for Nazarene Regional High School, and later became 
an assistant at the University of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
After Hawaii was placed on NCAA probation, Gillen moved to Virginia Military 
Institute for two seasons. He then left for Villanova, where he spent two years 
assisting Rollie Massimino. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with Rollie, I ate in every Italian restaurant from Maine to Florida," 
Gillen said. "Garlic was my middle name." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after five seasons as Digger Phelps' top assistant at Notre Dame, 
Gillen was hired by Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete has always had a real feel for the game," said Texas Coach Tom Penders, a 
longtime friend of Gillen's. "He has always been a person everybody liked. He 
never seemed to lose perspective. Some guys can be successful, but they're so 
one-dimensional, it's sickening." 
</P>
<P>
While Gillen has received much of the attention because of his personality, 
Xavier has two potential NBA first-round draft choices -- Hill and center Derek 
Strong. Strong, a 6-foot-10 senior from Palisades High, is averaging 13.8 
points and 9.8 rebounds a game. Hill, a 6-10 senior, is averaging 20.1 points 
and 12.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Musketeers also have a good shooting guard in Jamal Walker, a 5-11 junior 
averaging 15.1 points and 3.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
After playing its best game of the season to beat Georgetown, Xavier must face 
a Texas team that upset second-seeded Purdue, 73-72, last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns, who finished third in the Southwest Conference, have traded in 
their cowboy boots for Cinderella's glass slippers.

"We're not here on luck or because Cinderella didn't want to go, we're here 
because we should be here," Texas guard Lance Blanks said. 
</P>
<P>
Does Texas feel vindicated by its postseason success? 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we were a team that had to prove something all year long," Travis Mays 
said. "We were a team that was looked upon as not being able to win any big 
games on national TV. And now we've won two of the biggest games of the season 
on national TV." 
</P>
<P>
After containing Georgetown's strong front line of Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe 
Mutombo, Xavier will try to stall Texas' BMW -- guards Blanks, Mays and Joey 
Wright. Blanks is averaging 20.2 points, Mays 24.0 and Wright 19.2. 
</P>
<P>
"Their BMW is very tough to stop," Gillen said. "Defense, we think is a town in 
Bolivia. Our idea of defense is to let their guy get 22, and if we get 24, then 
we're successful. (But) we'd better play defense tomorrow or we could be in 
serious trouble."

NEWSWIRE: MICHIGAN STATE CHECKS STEROID ALLEGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michigan State officials are looking into allegations made in a story in the 
Detroit News that Spartan football players injected each other with 
muscle-building steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which conducted a two-month study with more than 100 players, 
parents, police officers and physicians, also said that up to seven players may 
have fooled NCAA testers on the eve of the 1988 Rose Bowl game with USC by 
using someone else's urine, carried in a plastic bag taped inside their armpits 
and attached to a tube that came out between their legs. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State beat USC, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Uryasz, NCAA director of testing, said it was unlikely the players could 
have pulled off a urine-test scam, adding this type of accusation is "one word 
against another." 
</P>
<P>
Some players said that offensive tackle Tony Mandarich frequently supplied 
steroids and helped some players who were afraid of needles, the newspaper 
said. Some referred to him as the "doctor," or "mentor."

Pete Rose, former manager of the Cincinnati Reds, is cooperating with a federal 
investigation into his income taxes in hopes of avoiding a prison term, the 
Cincinnati Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that prosecutors are considering filing charges of failing 
to report income rather than income tax evasion in exchange for Rose's 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Conviction on the evasion charge carries a maximum five-year sentence with a 
$250,000 fine. Failure to report income is punishable by a maximum of three 
years and a $250,000 fine.

Jerry Buss, owner of the Lakers, says he is considering building a new San 
Diego sports arena that he hopes will eventually house NBA and NHL franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can get a grant on some land and the franchises, the rest of it is slam 
dunk," Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
Buss told the San Diego Tribune that he has put together an unidentified group 
interested in relocating an NBA team, or getting an expansion team for his 
proposed new building. He said the Lakers would not be involved in the San 
Diego project. 
</P>
<P>
Buss also said he has applied to the NHL for an expansion franchise that he 
hopes to locate in San Diego.

Motocross will return to the Rose Bowl Saturday night for the first time in 
five years for Round 8 of the American Motorcyclist Assn.'s 18-race Camel 
Supercross series. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Matiasevich, 20, a rookie in the 250cc class in stadium racing, holds a 
tenuous lead in the most competitive Supercross series since promoter Mike 
Goodwin introduced the sport in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Matiasevich, a Kawasaki team rider from La Habra Heights, won in Las Vegas last 
Saturday night, extending his lead to 14 points over defending champion Jeff 
Stanton of Sherwood, Mich., who rides a Honda. 
</P>
<P>
There have been five winners in seven races, and not since 1985 -- the last 
year the race was held in the Rose Bowl -- have there been that many winners in 
an entire season. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Bradshaw, a Charlotte, N.C., teen-ager who won the first two races this 
season at Anaheim and Houston, is not expected to ride Saturday night because 
of an ankle injury he suffered in San Diego and aggravated two weeks ago in 
Daytona Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Johnson, another rider injured at Daytona, also will miss the Rose Bowl 
event. Johnson, a two-time Supercross champion from El Cajon, broke a finger on 
his throttle hand when he crashed while attempting to pass longtime rival Jeff 
Ward of Mission Viejo. Johnson is expected to return to racing for the next 
250cc national event on April 1 at Hangtown, near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson leads the national 250cc standings after winning the opening race at 
Gainesville, Fla., where he fell last year and injured his wrist so severely 
that he missed the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Others who will challenge Matiasevich include Stanton, who won in San Diego and 
Daytona; Larry Ward, a Suzuki rider from Society Hill, S.C., who scored his 
first Supercross victory in Seattle, and Jeff Ward, the Atlanta winner and no 
relation to Larry. 
</P>
<P>
Still looking for his first victory this season is spectacular French rider 
Jean-Michel Bayle, who won the world 250cc championship last year and was 
second in the last two Supercross events. 
</P>
<P>
Matiasevich, although a rookie in Supercross 250cc racing, has twice won the 
125cc western Supercross championship, and also won the Mickey Thompson Gran 
Prix ultracross championship in stadiums in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Even before winning almost wire-to-wire last week in Las Vegas, Matiasevich was 
the points leader because of a series of consistently high finishes. He was 
second in San Diego and Seattle and third in Anaheim and has not finished out 
of the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had to win one to prove that I belong on top," Matiasevich said. "I 
knew people were saying that since I hadn't won a race, I wasn't the true 
leader. But now I feel I deserve it. Now I'm legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing, is winning the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny O'Mara of Simi Valley, who won the last Rose Bowl race in a 
controversial season finale on a Honda, will be back on a Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
The first heat of the Coors Extra Gold Challenge for 250cc riders will start at 
7 p.m. There will also be support motos for 125cc riders. 
</P>
<P>
The standings: 1. Matiasevich, Kawasaki, 134 points; 2. Stanton, Honda, 120; 3. 
L. Ward, Suzuki, 119; 4. Mike Kiedrowski, Canyon Country, Honda, 99; 5. Bayle, 
Honda, 98; 6. Ronald Tichenor, Palm Harbor, Fla., Suzuki, 95; 7. J. Ward, 
Kawasaki, 94; 8. O'Mara, Kawasaki, 93; 9. Guy Cooper, Stillwater, Okla., 
Suzuki, 89; 10. Doug Dubach, Costa Mesa, Yamaha, 87. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- Bubby Jones, a two-time champion who has been absent from Ascot 
since July 23, 1988, will return to the California Racing Assn. competition 
Saturday night at Ascot Park. Jones, the 1983 and 1984 CRA champion and No. 2 
all-time CRA race winner with 77 victories, will drive a new Drake chassis when 
he joins a field seeking to slow point leader John Redican, who has two 
victories in four starts. The Chatsworth driver, who won the CRA opener at Mesa 
Marin in Bakersfield, also won the Ascot opener last week. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Eddie Lawson of Upland, who won his third world road racing 
championship last year on a Honda, will begin defense of his title Sunday in 
Japan on a Yamaha. Lawson has joined Kenny Roberts' Team Yamaha as a teammate 
of Wayne Rainey of Downey, the runner-up to Lawson in last year's 16-race 
series. The U.S. round will be April 8 at Laguna Seca Raceway near Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
INDY CARS -- Porsche, which will enter cars for Teo Fabi and John Andretti in 
all Indy car races this season, is looking for a primary sponsor to replace 
Moneytron, a Belgian financial management company that withdrew its support 
last month. Quaker State, which had been the primary sponsor since Porsche 
launched its Indy car program in 1987, will remain with the team but in a 
reduced role, according to Ed Triolo, Porsche public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
Porsche placed an ad in Monday's New York Times. Price of sponsorship is 
rumored to be more than $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- The Continental Motosports Club will play host to a two-day 
amateur championship Saturday and Sunday at Barona Oaks in Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
DRAGBOATS -- The International Hot Boat Assn. will open its 1990 season on 
Firebird Lake in Chandler, Ariz., with the Winternationals this weekend. Top 
fuel champion Ron Braaksma will be back to defend his title in the 220-m.p.h. 
class. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS CARS -- Unlimited cars of the Toyota Super Production series will race 
Sunday at Willow Springs Raceway. Sharing the course will be a California 
Sports Car Club regional championship.

PRICE, NOT COASTAL VOYAGE, SURPRISES TRAINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron McAnally said he wasn't surprised by Coastal Voyage's 8-1 upset in the 
$106,900 Sierra Madre Handicap Wednesday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the trainer could hardly believe that the 6-year-old went off at such 
a healthy price, the fifth-longest shot in the field of seven. 
</P>
<P>
"I really liked this horse today," McAnally said after his fourth stakes 
victory of the meeting, the most he has had at Santa Anita since he won five in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a genuine racehorse," McAnally said. "At this distance, he's genuine. 
(Jockey) Alex (Solis) works him every morning and knows him real well." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Solis and Coastal Voyage do have a love affair with the Santa Anita 
hillside turf course. They are now three for three over the layout. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Voyage put away Diamonds Galore, Summer Sale and favored Frost Free 
early, then held off the charging Raise A Stanza and won by a neck in 1:12 2/5, 
equaling Baffle's 20-year-old stakes record. 
</P>
<P>
Weldnaas, the 5-2 second choice, was another head back in third, a length in 
front of Tanker Port. Frost Free finished fifth at 17-10 in his first try on 
the turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron and I talked about it before the race," Solis said, "and he told me there 
were two or three speed horses in there and to lay second, third or fourth 
behind the speed. When he got clear at the quarter pole, he took off. He loves 
it down the hill. He's really smart and he's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Frost Free, who had blitzed Sunny Blossom in the slop in last month's El 
Conejo, didn't seem overly fond of the grass, according to Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't feel very comfortable," he said. "But he's got some class. He kept 
digging and trying, even though he wasn't getting a hold of it." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah President John Brunetti, who owns Coastal Voyage, flew in to watch the 
Sierra Madre. "I lost my luggage, but it was worth it," he said. "I enjoy 
California racing. It's organized, structured, delightful, a pleasant change 
from Florida." . . . With the pool having exceeded $500,000 Wednesday, there 
will be a mandatory payout in the Pick Nine today. There is also an $85,392.53 
carryover in the Pick Six. 
</P>
<P>
The stewards fined Corey Black and Patrick Valenzuela $100 apiece for their 
altercation in the jockey's room after Sunday's seventh race. . . . Oraibi, who 
won six of 17 starts and $361,850 for trainer Richard Mandella, has been 
retired and will stand at stud at Tony Matos' farm in Llano. Oraibi, who won 
the Sierra Madre Handicap and Malibu Stakes, broke a cannon bone after working 
Feb. 15. . . . Alex Solis, Robbie Davis and Valenzuela each won twice 
Wednesday.

UCLA MAKES RUN FOR NCAA TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the outdoor season already under way, it is apparent that UCLA has another 
strong men's team, at least on the dual meet and conference level. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins could also be a factor in the NCAA meet if some athletes recover 
from injuries and others develop as the season progresses. 
</P>
<P>
In assessing his team, Coach Bob Larsen said that he has some proven athletes, 
such as Olympic 400-meter gold medalist Steve Lewis, along with weight men, 
throwers and jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
"However, we may not have enough depth of quality sprinters for overall points, 
including the relays, at the NCAA level," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
As for USC, its season is dedicated to the NCAA meet. Ernie Bullard's Trojans 
don't have enough depth to challenge UCLA in the dual, or Pacific 10 meets. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Trojans have enough quality athletes to make some impact in the 
NCAA meet in June. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, injuries to Lewis and other potential scorers prevented UCLA from 
winning a third consecutive NCAA championship. The Bruins finished sixth, after 
scoring 81 and 82 points in literally running away with the NCAA title in 1987 
and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since Larsen became UCLA's coach in 1985, the Bruins have compiled a 45-0-1 
dual meet record. Moreover, they will be favored to win their fourth 
consecutive Pac-10 championship, unprecedented since the conference was 
realigned in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA would have been even stronger last year if quarter-miler Danny Everett and 
Henry Thomas had not left the team with eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Everett's departure was much like the current exodus of college football 
underclassmen into the NFL draft. Top track athletes are rewarded financially 
by competing internationally and some have lucrative shoe contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is still in school, but has decided not to compete with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen anticipates that Brian Blutreich, Peter Thompson and John Knight will 
provide points in the NCAA meet as they did last year. Blutreich was third in 
the shotput and fourth in the discus. Thompson was third in the discus and 
Knight eighth in the hammer throw. 
</P>
<P>
Knight was bothered by a back injury last year. That's gone now, though, and he 
has already thrown the discus 212 feet, a personal best. 
</P>
<P>
Among other Bruins with the potential to score at the national level are 
hurdler Derek Knight, long jumpers McArthur Anderson and Chuckie Brooks, 
distance runner Mark Dani and freshman javelin thrower Erik Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks is currently ineligible but is expected to regain his eligibility for 
the next school quarter, beginning in April. 
</P>
<P>
Decathlete Joe Duarte is out for the season with a knee injury incurred in a 
motor scooter accident. Sprinter Derrick Baker is out indefinitely with a knee 
injury and javelin thrower Dave Bunevacz, who placed third in the Pac-10 meet 
in 1989, is inactive with a herniated disk. 
</P>
<P>
USC has won 26 NCAA outdoor titles, substantially more than any other school. 
However, with NCAA track scholarship limitations imposing some hardship on 
private schools with high tuition costs, the Trojans haven't been much of a 
factor the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
That was also compounded by some evaluating mistakes in recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a balanced team," Bullard said. "Our team is basically an NCAA team 
and everything we do is a means to that ends." 
</P>
<P>
With selective recruiting, a team can be factor in the NCAA meet, even with 
small numbers, and that's USC's goal now. 
</P>
<P>
Bullard's premier athletes are intermediate hurdler George Porter, who finished 
third in the NCAA meet last year; sprinter Quincy Watts, the former Taft High 
star who was injured at the end of the season, and newcomer Dietmar Haaf, the 
European indoor long jump champion from West Germany, and a transfer from the 
University of Stuttgart. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans lost a potential scorer in big meets when Luc Krotwaar of the 
Netherlands, a 3:40.8 1,500-meter runner, became homesick and left school. 
</P>
<P>
Bullard believes that he can put together two quality relay teams that should 
score high in the NCAA meet. 
</P>
<P>
His 400-meter team will be composed of Martin Cannady, a transfer from Long 
Beach City College, football players Calvin Holmes and Travis Hannah, and 
Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Cannady, Hannah and Watts will be on the 1,600-meter team along with Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Gee, a linebacker on the football team, is a former high school 
record-holder in the javelin. However, the Trojans are thin in most field 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kersee, UCLA women's track coach, says that his team has quality depth in 
all areas -- and so it appears. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins certainly have the potential to win the NCAA championship with such 
talented athletes are Janeene Vickers, who won the 400-meter hurdles in the 
NCAA meet last year, heptathlete Tonya Sedwick, versatile weight performer 
Tracie Millett, middle distance runner Laura Chapel and freshman Angela 
Burnham, who won five state sprint titles while competing for Rio Mesa High in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the deepest team I've been associated with since, perhaps, the 1982-83 
teams," said Kersee, alluding to his championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
USC's women's team doesn't have the depth, nor as many quality athletes as 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan women will be depending mainly on intermediate hurdler Leslie Maxie, 
a 1988 Olympian, javelin thrower Ashley Selman, sprinter-long jumper Louan 
Guialdo, and sprinter Angela Rolfe. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former distance runner Max Truex believes that some severe previous cases of 
heat prostration were the cause of his Parkinson's disease, although doctors 
rule out his theory. In any event, George Kiseda, a former editor at The Times, 
recalls that Truex and Bob Soth were both hospitalized after a 10,000-meter 
race of the U.S.-Soviet Union meet at Philadelphia in 1959. Track &amp; Field 
News' account of their condition at the time: "The doctor who treated both 
Truex and Soth marveled at their recuperative powers and their physical 
condition. He said the oxygen, carbon dioxide, salt and fluid depletion that 
they had experienced would have been fatal to an average 30-year-old man."

BUSH SEEKS ARTS FUNDS WITHOUT CONTENT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House, fending off demands that it limit the content of federally 
supported art, Wednesday sent Congress a proposal to renew arts funding without 
any restrictions on subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration proposed a five-year extension of the National 
Endowment for the Arts and rejected content controls such as those that sparked 
an uproar here last year and led to a one-year congressional ban on financing 
of artworks thought to be obscene. 
</P>
<P>
NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer, testifying before a House subcommittee 
considering a budget authorization for the arts, said: "After much careful 
thought and discussion, it is our conclusion that the legislation proposed 
here, which contains no content restrictions, . . . will best serve the 
American public." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA controversy centers on objections by some conservatives to federal 
support for artworks that may be offensive, sacrilegious or indecent. 
</P>
<P>
The protests were set off last year by two photographic exhibits that received 
NEA support. One, by Robert Mapplethorpe, included sadomasochistic and 
homoerotic themes. The other, by Andres Serrano, depicted a crucifix in a jar 
of urine. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) objected vehemently to those projects and pushed 
through a measure that withheld $40,000 of the NEA's funding, the equivalent of 
the money spent on those projects, and imposed the one-year restrictions. The 
NEA's budget for this year is $171 million. 
</P>
<P>
"To those who are offended, I am truly sorry," Frohnmayer said of last year's 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
But, he told the subcommittee, "art is like research. It is trying new things, 
taking risks, pushing boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all art succeeds. To not do research is to stand still and be bypassed by 
the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA director also pointed out that the endowment relies heavily on reviews 
by citizens' panels in issuing grants. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), chairman of the House education and labor 
subcommittee, called the proposal announced by Frohnmayer "a major piece of 
information and news." 
</P>
<P>
But while the Bush proposal was welcomed by arts groups and arts supporters in 
Congress, it promises to lead to more difficult congressional and public 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), the leading congressional proponent of NEA 
restrictions, said Thursday evening that he had not been officially notified of 
the Bush proposal, but: "If the arts community has convinced the Administration 
that government should keep funding things like pictures of Jesus Christ in 
bottles or urine . . . then I think the Administration has been misguided." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said he had not lobbied the White House on his call for content 
restrictions, and he conceded that Bush's proposal could hinder his effort. But 
he said he expects the issue to be vigorously debated. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a major debate in Congress," he said. "And the American people, 
as they become aware that there are no restrictions on the use of their tax 
dollars for live sex shows, are going to be more and more outraged." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, head of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values 
Coalition, which supports content controls, said Thursday: "We're very 
disappointed. I don't really understand why they've done this. . . . While it 
is most unfortunate that the White House currently is being insensitive to the 
values and a beliefs of those who support the President on many other issues, 
we will continue to press forward with this specific issue." 
</P>
<P>
In Raleigh, N.C., Helms announced that he had written to the General Accounting 
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, demanding an investigation of the 
arts endowment. In a statement, Helms contended that the arts endowment had 
continued to fund pornographic artworks, despite the restrictions imposed last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer, in his testimony, angrily denied that the NEA has ever had a policy 
of promoting obscene artworks. He attacked right-wing groups by name -- 
including the Mississippi-based American Family Assn. and the fundamentalist 
"700 Club" TV program -- and accused the family association of mounting an 
advertising campaign "seeking to raise funds . . . at the expense of the 
National Endowment for the Arts." Rep. E. Thomas Coleman (R-Mo.), the ranking 
Republican on the subcommittee, complained that the controversy and debate over 
the NEA reflected "a bumper sticker mentality" in which discussion "has been 
simplified down to whether one supports pornography . . . or censorship." 
</P>
<P>
But Coleman said the content of some of the photographic images that were the 
initial source of the controversy that began last year remains troublesome. He 
and Rep. Paul B. Henry (R-Mich.) warned Frohnmayer it may be impossible to 
navigate the NEA reauthorization bill through Congress without content 
restrictions being attached at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not attempt to justify artworks that offend common sense standards of 
decency," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said it may be inevitable -- even desirable -- that a political compromise 
will have to be struck under which the NEA authorizing law would contain 
"appropriate language that will guarantee freedom of artistic expression and 
accountability" for possibly offensive content. 
</P>
<P>
"I, for one, am deeply distressed by some of the grants funded by the NEA," 
Henry told Frohnmayer. But he was even more sharply critical of what he 
characterized as "duplicity and moral posturing" by members of Congress who 
have become the NEA's most effective adversaries. Though he did not mention 
them by name, Henry, Williams and other subcommittee members made it clear they 
were referring to Helms and Rohrabacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the political posturing on this issue is itself pornographic," the 
Michigan Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "please don't blind yourself to the political reality. The NEA 
has some explaining to do. In order to save it, we are going to have to reform 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement Wednesday, Helms said he "is deeply concerned about the NEA's 
apparent indifference to enforcing the congressional ban on funding obscene 
art." 
</P>
<P>
Despite personal assertions by Frohnmayer that the endowment would not, as a 
matter of policy, pay for obscene works, Helms said that "the evidence to the 
contrary is so compelling that is imperative that there be an objective 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Helms' letter, addressed to Controller General Charles A. Bowsher, included 
several examples of allegedly pornographic art. At the opening of the letter, 
Helms cautioned Bowsher that "because of the nature of the enclosed material, I 
urge that great care be taken to assure that your women associates are not 
exposed to the material." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA said Frohnmayer had no immediate comment on the demand for a GAO 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Coleman pressed Frohnmayer specifically to clarify remarks 
he made at a subcommittee hearing two weeks ago at the J. Paul Getty Museum in 
Malibu when, responding reluctantly to repeated questions by Williams, 
Frohnmayer said it is appropriate for the federal government to support 
artworks that may be offensive to some people. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is artistically excellent," Frohnmayer told Coleman on Wednesday, "it 
does not make it unfundable just because it is offensive. Some art is 
offensive. That is not to say that (artistic) voices ought to be denied federal 
funding, if it is excellent art."

O.C. DRUG FUGITIVE LIVES IT UP IN, OUT OF MEXICAN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two hours of rough sea, pelting spray and threatening sky, the catch 
aboard the sportfishing boat Melissa was one dolphin. Then came a sharp tug on 
one of the lines. A fish -- its silver-blue sides emitting an eerie glow off 
the stern -- had taken the bait, a small rubber squid with streamers fit for a 
kid's handlebars. 
</P>
<P>
"Marliiiin!" the Mexican deckhand yelled. "Marliiiin!" 
</P>
<P>
Daniel James Fowlie, one of the most wanted men in Orange County's war on 
drugs, took a final swig of his cerveza and settled into the fighting chair for 
a 40-minute battle with what he respectfully calls "a gentleman's fish." 
Granted a four-day pass, he was miles from the La Paz prison cell where he has 
been held since being apprehended by Mexican authorities in 1987 on 49 drug 
charges filed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The counts against Fowlie in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles include 
conspiracy to distribute and sell hundreds of thousands of pounds of marijuana 
and lesser amounts of cocaine, and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly three years he was held behind bars while lawyers battled in Mexican 
court to force his return to face the charges. 
</P>
<P>
But lately, life is a little easier for him in this subtropical region that has 
become a roost for American sportsmen and a suspected gateway for drugs bound 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In December, a court in Mazatlan rejected the United States' extradition 
request, concluding that Fowlie's return would violate the Mexican 
Constitution. The judges said the as-yet unproven case against him is mostly 
based on evidence from felons, always viewed as generally unreliable, and that 
Mexico recognizes no such crime as "conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the decision by the Colegiado del 12th Districto could free Fowlie, 
57, the alleged mastermind of a vast marijuana network based in Orange County 
that purportedly did business with drug lords suspected of killing U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique (Kiki) Camarena Salazar in 1985. A 
final review of whether to uphold the court ruling is pending. 
</P>
<P>
If Fowlie is released and remains in Mexico, beyond the reach of U.S. law, the 
loss will be a major blow to a 5-year-old criminal prosecution that has led to 
the convictions of five people, including his two sons, and resulted in the 
seizure of Rancho del Rio, Fowlie's 213-acre spread on the east Orange County 
border. The rustic site, worth an estimated $6 million, was turned into a huge 
prop last summer for a national address on drugs by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch "was the core of an international marijuana and cocaine-smuggling 
ring," Bush told a crowd of 1,500 people from a podium near Fowlie's front 
porch. "How many lives, how many families, how many hopes and dreams have been 
destroyed with these chemical weapons of death and destruction -- drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Dog-and-pony show," said Fowlie, who believes his secluded ranch was seized 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no tape recordings, no drug buys, no nothing on me," Fowlie 
continued. "When they do get something on me, it's always (from) some other 
criminal and that's what they don't like down here. Those guys are three-time 
losers and full-time liars. . . . I like Mexican justice better. They stick to 
their laws." 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie's release, investigators warn, also could thwart any chance to question 
and perhaps make a deal with a man who could provide useful information about 
the reputed drug lords suspected of killing Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie called the assertion "absurd." He says his only connection with them is 
that they both used a very popular and skilled pilot in Latin America to fly 
their private planes. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts in Mexican law say that Fowlie's conditions of confinement during 
his extradition fight are typical of those for inmates who have money, 
prominence or the persuasiveness to convince authorities that they will not 
escape if released for short periods. 
</P>
<P>
But other experts disputed whether such treatment is commonplace in lengthy 
extradition cases. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is that this is clearly irregular and there is no legal basis for 
this type of action," said Prof. Jorge A. Vargas, director of the Mexico-U.S. 
Law Institute at the University of San Diego School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
If Fowlie is being released improperly, Vargas said, it could trigger a "very 
serious" investigation by Mexico's judicial authorities, including the attorney 
general's office and Ministry of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
"They kinda' let me do what I want around here now," said Fowlie, an inmate at 
Centro de Readaptacion Social in La Paz, a prison known as CERESO. "There are 
people in Cabo San Lucas who still believe in me. They know these charges in 
the United States have ruined my life and that I haven't been convicted of 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
He says he has been periodically released on legitimate work furloughs and for 
Christmas last year. In 1988, he recalled, he was let out several times, but 
the privileges were suspended until after December's court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Ramirez, a San Diego attorney who specializes in Mexican law, said the 
granting of passes from prison is largely left up to prison commanders. If they 
are provided assurances that the person is not a flight risk, Ramirez said, the 
prison chiefs can release inmates temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
After repeated attempts, prison authorities could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, and to the dismay of U.S. authorities, Fowlie is not just 
surviving, he is doing relatively well. He owns a rock-and-tile house on 
beachfront property north of Cabo San Lucas, where his prized pit bulls stand 
guard, including Rosie, a reddish-brown dog that survived a concussion grenade 
in the 1985 raid on Rancho del Rio. 
</P>
<P>
His wealth, he says, has come from years of land investments and the Leather 
Gypsy, a successful leather goods business in Laguna Beach that he sold for $3 
million in the early 1970s. He moved to Latin America shortly after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
He said his engineering skills and construction equipment have been enlisted by 
a Mexican real estate company with big plans for a shopping center. And he said 
the bar association of Baja California Sur commissioned him to paint a 
long-eared, horned owl for Carlos Salinas Gortare, the president of Mexico. He 
has a photograph of the presentation to the president. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie has displayed his other watercolors and oils of fish and marine fowl at 
art shows in the hotel-studded fishing village. From painting alone, he says, 
he has made thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In town, the charismatic Fowlie is known by scores of hoteliers, restaurateurs, 
lawyers and skippers of sportfishing boats that are docked in the snug harbor. 
</P>
<P>
In prison, Fowlie wears his own clothes, usually jeans and flannel shirts. He 
is on a first-name basis with the staff, and the atmosphere in the jail yard is 
more akin to a city park. To help him take care of business on the outside, his 
Jeep Cherokee is in the parking lot and he has hired an errand boy for $400 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't abuse the privileges, and I have never tried to escape," Fowlie said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not like (Rafael) Caro-Quintero. If they think so, they are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Quintero is suspected of being a high-level drug dealer in Mexico, who 
allegedly masterminded the torture-slaying of DEA agent Camarena. After his 
capture, he equipped his private cell with a double bed and modern 
conveniences, such as a satellite dish for a television. 
</P>
<P>
Tanned and fit, Fowlie is housed behind CERESO's whitewashed walls in a wing 
reserved for inmates awaiting trial. He says his cell, which he shares with 
seven prisoners, measures 12 by 15 feet -- nothing extravagant. 
</P>
<P>
In the jail yard, large thatched umbrellas and trees in brown cinder-block 
planters provide shade for visitors and inmates' families. On one side is a 
refreshment stand selling sodas and candy. In the center, meat sizzles on the 
grill of a carnitas stand. 
</P>
<P>
"They make great hamburgers," Fowlie said. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, children chase each other around the yard, which is equipped with 
a slide and swing set. Vendors sell sweet rolls, embroidered blouses and carved 
sailing ships in green-tinted bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The only reminder of prison is the concrete guard tower, where a sentry stands 
with an M-16 rifle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the country club of Mexican prisons," said Kathy Peterson, a U.S. Foreign 
Service officer responsible for checking American prisoners in Baja California. 
"The facility is clean, in a good climate, and there's plenty of food. I have 
visited him (Fowlie), but he is not much interested in seeing us." 
</P>
<P>
The commandant of CERESO could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
American diplomats and FBI agents working on the Fowlie case said they have 
heard rumors that he has been let out of prison repeatedly to take care of 
personal business, including once during a visit to the prison by a U.S. vice 
consul. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly eager to get him back," said Special FBI Agent Jim Nielson. 
</P>
<P>
But embassy officials and federal authorities are pessimistic about getting 
Fowlie back and say there is not much they can do about it. Diplomatic pressure 
on Mexican authorities doesn't always work, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not much we can do except file the extradition papers," said Special 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Sanford Feldman, who is handling the Fowlie case. "We 
believe we have a strong case against him. Others have pleaded guilty and the 
important players in the alleged operation are set to testify." 
</P>
<P>
In the February, 1985, raid on Rancho del Rio, law enforcement authorities said 
they uncovered what appeared to be a major drug-smuggling operation and 
confiscated virtually everything. 
</P>
<P>
Local and federal agents took control of 12 structures of imported logs and 
river rock. They seized Fowlie's kennels, wine press, a number of beat-up 
Volkswagen Beetles, stables, spas and a warehouse full of antiques. It took 
eight officers just to move Fowlie's marble and mother-of-pearl banquet table 
trimmed with Chinese wood carvings. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities say the incriminating evidence includes a money-counting 
machine, a subterranean storage area, cocaine-processing chemicals and 
packaging equipment. They found Hitachi television cartons and sheets of fabric 
softener -- an alleged way to disguise drug shipments and mask the odor of 
marijuana, court records say. 
</P>
<P>
Confiscated, too, were $23,000 in cash, a counterfeit bill detector, electronic 
scales, an anti-bugging device, and a collection of shotguns, antique firearms, 
rifles, pistols and an Uzi semiautomatic. 
</P>
<P>
But Fowlie was out of the country at the time of the raid. What is more, court 
records show that the only drugs found were traces of cocaine, a few ounces of 
pot, and marijuana residue in a barn believed to be a drug-processing center. 
Hardly the stuff of a major drug-smuggling operation, defense attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
The case also has been plagued by witness problems, and an Orange County 
Superior Court judge suppressed all evidence from the ranch because he 
considered the 1985 search warrant improper. Federal court motions to throw out 
the search warrant also have been filed by defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie contends that the barn with its subterranean storage area was used for 
keeping grapes and making wine. The packaging equipment, he explains, helped to 
preserve fruit from the ranch's orchards, while the so-called 
cocaine-processing chemicals were fuel additives for his son's dune buggies. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, federal and state authorities believe that Fowlie set up a 
network of drug suppliers in Latin America that included Francisco Javier 
Caro-Payan and his cousin, Rafael Caro-Quintero. Hundreds of thousands of 
pounds of marijuana and far lesser amounts of cocaine were smuggled over the 
border, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, reputed to be a major marijuana trafficker, is accused of plotting 
the torture-slaying of DEA Agent Camarena in 1985, according to federal court 
records. Payan, the suspected chief of drug operations in Baja California, was 
convicted in San Diego and sentenced to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"The case against Fowlie is only difficult in that it is historical," 
prosecutor Feldman said. "It's just people talking about what happened in the 
past. It's not nice and neat in the sense of undercover drug buys, but the 
important players are prepared to testify." 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie said the charges are greatly exaggerated and the product of three 
convicted drug dealers who "made up stories" to save themselves. If anything, 
he says, he is the victim of people who took advantage of his permission to 
live and work on Rancho del Rio during his 16-year absence from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been convicted of anything," Fowlie said. "They have taken all my 
money and seized all my property so I can't defend myself. They've got my kids 
in jail and caused my divorce. How much more do they want?"

Nearly one-fourth of all California communities are building no housing for the 
poor, despite state-mandated plans that require each community to construct its 
share of low-income housing, according to a survey by the California Coalition 
for Rural Housing. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that plenty of homes are being built for the wealthy, but only 
16% of the housing needed for low-income people is being constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that only 97,424 low-income housing units were built statewide 
through the end of 1989 -- at least 500,000 housing units less than required 
under current plans. The survey alleges that 82 community redevelopment 
agencies violated state law by failing to set aside money for low-income 
housing in communities that have not met housing goals for the poor.

CENSUS NOTEBOOK;

HOMELESS PROVE HARD TO FIND IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Full of great expectations, John Inmon set out early Wednesday morning to count 
the homeless of Orange County. Trouble is, he discovered, you can't count them 
if you can't find them. 
</P>
<P>
Outfitted in luminescent white vests, Inmon and two partners poked through 
parks in Tustin, probed railroad tracks stretching along the county's southern 
flank, peered beneath bushes and pointed flashlights under freeway overpasses 
-- all as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's ambitious, nationwide effort to 
count the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But after more than two hours spent doggedly searching the usual spots where 
the homeless congregate, the census takers came up empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
It was, Inmon admitted, "sort of disappointing not to have found anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Some census officials said Wednesday that it appeared the homeless had been 
avoiding being counted. 
</P>
<P>
"We went under bridges and overpasses and it just looked like those places had 
been cleaned out," said Gene Glenn, Fullerton census field operations 
supervisor. "You could see signs that people had been living there, but it just 
seemed like they had picked up and left." 
</P>
<P>
Lisavette Barden checked underneath several freeway overpasses for the census 
effort and came away with a similar impression. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like people split when they saw us," she said. "We'd see their 
things still lying there, but they'd be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Fear certainly played into the formula, authorities said. Ken Hulett, a field 
researcher for the Fullerton census office, said he cast his flashlight beam on 
two homeless people under a freeway bridge and drew an unmistakable response. 
</P>
<P>
"At first they raised their hands," he said. "I guess they thought we were 
cops." 
</P>
<P>
Stu Wakley, 38, was standing in front of the YMCA in Santa Ana, talking with 
some of his buddies from the streets while the census was being conducted. 
Wakley has been homeless for almost two years. His life began unraveling when 
he was injured during a construction job two years ago.Now he spends most 
nights in deserted parks throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I think counting the homeless in the census is important so the government 
will know where the problems are," Wakley said. "That way, they can work on 
building affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Solorio, a 39-year-old homeless man in Santa Ana, also held out hope 
that the census might mean a change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if they know how many people are out here, maybe they can help get us 
all jobs," said Solorio, a bearded, 6-foot-3 man with a barrel chest. "It might 
be a positive wave to come through." 
</P>
<P>
But for Solorio, it wasn't what one would call a good night. 
</P>
<P>
Taking swigs out of a bottle of liquor, Solorio began using a golf club to 
fence with a companion wielding a baseball bat. Games became serious when 
Solorio swung wildly and hit the other man in the face, gashing his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
As blood gushed from the wound, a crowd of other homeless men gathered around 
and berated Solorio. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes of desperately attempting to apologize, Solorio gave up and 
left, promising never to return to the street corner. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the homeless are "professional hiders," people who have learned that 
survival on the street means sinking out of sight when darkness falls, said 
Emily Lietz, census director in Buena Park. And the census count may have 
suffered because of it. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning since she opened the Buena Park office in October, Lietz has seen 
a homeless man appear as if out of nowhere on a bench outside her window. That 
is, except on the day of the census. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Lietz resorted to sending out an employee to look for the man, 
but "we couldn't find him in the night," she said. He only reappeared after the 
sun came up Wednesday when the counting was over. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montes, director of the Fullerton census office, spent three hours 
searching the streets with a survey crew. They returned without finding 
evidence of a single homeless person. 
</P>
<P>
As other field enumerators began trickling in, it became obvious that most 
others had experienced no better luck. The next three teams said they turned up 
no one on their searches. A fourth team's announcement that a homeless man had 
been found under an overpass elicited cheers from tired workers. 
</P>
<P>
By 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, two more teams had checked in with a total of 13 more 
homeless found under bridges, overpasses or sleeping in vehicles in mall 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
"This is awfully discouraging," said Lou Porchia, Fullerton field operation 
manager. "How can we count these people if they don't stand up? If they're not 
there, you can't count them." 
</P>
<P>
As the most ambitious effort of its type ever, the homeless census had its 
glitches. 
</P>
<P>
At the Anaheim Interfaith Shelter, a 10-unit complex, three sets of census 
takers rolled by during the night, according to Chaundra Perry-Howard, 26, who 
has lived in the 10-unit complex since she separated from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Perry-Howard said the census process was a breeze. "They just asked a couple of 
questions, filled out the form, and I guess now I'm counted. . . . Homeless is 
not just bums in the park, it's also being too proud to go home to Mom and 
Dad." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Cantor, night supervisor at Laguna Beach's 24-bed Friendship Shelter, said 
he was surprised by the arrival of the census takers Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I had heard about the census, but no one warned us they were coming," Cantor 
said. "Two people just arrived here about 9 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
Cantor rounded up most of the shelter's occupants, who gathered in a meeting 
room at the back of the two-story structure that once had been an apartment 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some people at the Laundromat, a few others were just out," Cantor 
said. "Judging by this, I can't say they got an accurate count. I don't think 
most of my clients knew about it. They really don't read the papers." 
</P>
<P>
David Mahoney, a Westminster resident who helped out as a census taker, said he 
had expected the homeless "to know what's going on" with the census, but most 
"had no idea what we were talking about. I thought there would be a little more 
reception because of TV ads. But I guess that doesn't matter since they don't 
have a TV." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone subsisting on the streets was so out of touch with the plans of 
the U.S. Census Bureau. Numerous homeless people were able to recite all the 
reasons for the survey -- to gauge the nation's population, to determine how 
federal monies should be distributed. And some suggested it might benefit their 
lives if they participated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great idea because if they are going to allocate money for the homeless 
and they need to know what's out there," said Anthony Wallace, a 27-year-old 
homeless man. "They are going to be surprised by the figure." 
</P>
<P>
By dawn Wednesday, Kenneth Nash and his team of enumerators in North Orange 
County had counted just one homeless person as they shuttled to various parks 
and business districts. 
</P>
<P>
As the first rays of sunlight embraced the landscape, the census takers saw a 
man in a car stir and sit up. They recorded his race and approximate age, but 
did not bother disturbing him further. 
</P>
<P>
Later they found another man sleeping in a nook of a railroad bridge and 
several empty sleeping bags. They returned to the office after finding just 
three homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed we didn't see them," Nash said. "I know they're out there. . 
. . We'll have to do something different next time. I don't know what."

LAGUNA STREET PERSON DOESN'T STAND UP, ISN'T COUNTED

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His name is Sandor Nagy, and he wraps a tattered sleeping bag about his body as 
he wanders barefoot along the streets of this seaside art colony with a smile 
on his grizzled face. 
</P>
<P>
As distinctive as Nagy looks -- passers-by do doubletakes when they see him 
shuffling along, hands clasped in prayer -- he managed to elude Census workers 
conducting a head count of the homeless Tuesday night and early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
While the counters scanned the nooks and crannies of Laguna Beach and other 
communities with large numbers of homeless, Nagy, a former Los Angeles car 
salesman, spent the night anonymously secure in a large flower planter atop a 
two-story parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
"God bless you and your family," he said to a visitor before covering himself 
with a blanket and retiring for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Nagy, 36, a Hungarian immigrant, was one of an undetermined number of the 
county's homeless who were apparently missed in the census. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Beach, two very intoxicated men hopped a one-way bus to Capistrano 
Beach late Tuesday night before they could be included in the count. Four other 
homeless people said they had had no contact with census takers as of 10 p.m. 
Tuesday, when all headed off to find places on the streets to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Local homeless activists said they were not surprised that street people were 
missed in the count, considering the abundance of hiding places that can be 
found in the hills, canyons and bluffs of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing a census is pretty self-defeating here because the people with street 
skills are not going to be found," said the Rev. Colin Henderson, executive 
director of Laguna's Friendship Shelter, which houses about 20 of Laguna's 
estimated 70 to 90 homeless every night. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the census effort had said that they expected to have difficulties 
in finding all the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always admitted that we probably would not get all of them, but we did 
everything we could to get as many as we possibly could," William Bellamy, 
manager of the Census Bureau's South Orange County district, said Wednesday. 
"We had locations where the homeless might be identified to us by the 
community, and we sent people to those locations." 
</P>
<P>
Bellamy acknowledged, however, that some of the homeless "float," or move 
around frequently, hampering efforts to find them. 
</P>
<P>
As Orange County's census count began with a check of homeless shelters Tuesday 
evening, Nagy conversed with a group of four other homeless men on the sidewalk 
outside an all-night diner. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was 10 p.m., the night was still young for Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know what time it is or what day it is," Nagy explained as he 
strolled along the Main Beach boardwalk later. "I just know there is the water 
and the waves." 
</P>
<P>
Nagy is known locally as "the Holy Man" because of his propensity for reciting 
prayer and bestowing religious blessings. According to Michael Avery, an art 
gallery owner and local homeless advocate, Nagy was a successful car salesman 
in Los Angeles until he was struck by an automobile and left mentally disabled 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nagy emigrated from his native Budapest 20 years ago, settling in Los Angeles. 
His family is in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Nagy walks for miles each day. Tuesday night, after walking non-stop for three 
hours, a visitor asked why he did not rest. 
</P>
<P>
"If I stop, my heart will stop," Nagy said. 
</P>
<P>
Leading an intricate tour of the Laguna downtown area, where many of the 
community's homeless are concentrated, Nagy pointed out some of his haunts. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to sleep here before the city cut it short," Nagy said, nodding toward 
a clump of newly landscaped shrubbery near a children's playground on Main 
Beach. "I awakened to the laughter of children." 
</P>
<P>
Nagy described his current sleeping spot as a "grave" because it offers him so 
much concealment. 
</P>
<P>
Feeding and clothing himself is not a problem, he said, because "brothers and 
sisters" in the homeless community and well-wishing downtown merchants help him 
out because of his accident. 
</P>
<P>
"People feed him because their hearts go out to him," said Lin Rivers, owner of 
a Laguna decorating service and another homeless advocate. 
</P>
<P>
While Nagy expresses general contentment, he occasionally shouts in anger over 
two nemeses: memories of the accident and what he calls harassment of the 
homeless by local police. 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly shakes the bad feelings away through prayer. Having walked for 
three straight hours with his visitor, Nagy ended the night by reciting the 
Lord's Prayer while kneeling in his flower-bed home. 
</P>
<P>
Then, his head disappeared into the flowers as he went to sleep.

LAKE PLAN THREATENS BIRDS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ASHCRAFT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of nesting mallards and great blue herons, and their eggs and chicks, 
could be destroyed if county officials drain Anaheim Lake, a process already 
begun, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says. 
</P>
<P>
The man-made lake, water source and popular fishing hole will be drained this 
weekend so tractors can bulldoze the lake bed clean. But those migratory birds 
are threatened by the plan, said Herb Curry, a Fish and Wildlife Service agent. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Lake is valued because its sandy bottom allows thousands of gallons of 
water to seep into the earth and replenish an underground water reservoir, 
which, in turn, supplies drinking water to most of Orange County. The water 
district pumps in Santa Ana River water because it percolates into the earth 
better at the lake than it does in the river. 
</P>
<P>
But over the course of a year, a carpet of algae builds up, blocking seepage 
and slowing the rate at which water sinks into the ground. Water officials say 
scouring the algae off is the only way to return the seepage process to full 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is concerned that scores of heron and 
duck chicks and their eggs will be destroyed by the tractors, said Herb Curry, 
special agent based in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Wildlife also fears that the nests on the three islands will be 
exposed to predators once the lake is drained and four-legged animals can cross 
on dry land to what is usually a refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are protected by the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Curry said. 
Anyone found guilty of killing a migratory bird or destroying an egg or a nest 
-- even accidentally -- can be fined $20,000 or jailed for one year, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Van Haun, a spokesman for the water district, said he does not believe that 
any birds were hurt or killed in previous drainings. And he said he had placed 
a call with Fish and Wildlife officials Wednesday to learn how the water 
district could ensure the birds' safety this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we've ever destroyed a nest," he said. "But we are going to 
watch that very closely" this year. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials are draining the lake now because they want to refill it with 
water supplies before they run dry in the summer, Van Haun said. In addition to 
pumping in water from the Santa Ana River, the water district pipes imported 
water for Anaheim Lake from the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proceeding ahead," Van Haun said. "We'll watch our operation very 
closely so that we don't kill any birds. We won't be in violation of the act if 
we don't kill any birds." 
</P>
<P>
The water that is pumped out of the lake will be piped to the Santa Ana River, 
where most of it is expected to seep into the ground in a six-mile stretch of 
levees built by the water district. 
</P>
<P>
Draining the lake and scouring its bottom will take about 30 days, Van Haun 
said. MICHAEL ASHCRAFT

CITY OKS EXPANSION OF MEDICAL BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved plans this week to allow an expanded medical office 
building across the street from St. Jude Hospital &amp; Rehabilitation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Several doctors spoke in favor of allowing a developer to replace the current 
31,500-square-foot office building with a three-story building more than twice 
its size on the southeast corner of Harbor Boulevard and Valencia Mesa Drive in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they have outgrown the current building and need more office space 
near the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Molly McClanahan voted against the project, saying she did not 
like the idea of such a large building on that corner. She asked council 
members to scale down the proposed 72,000-square-foot building to 60,000 square 
feet, but was outvoted 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the larger building, the project also includes a four-level parking 
structure with 355 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the developer and co-owner of the building, McBride Development Co. 
of Brea, had asked the city to allow a 109,000-square-foot building on the 
corner. But the Planning Commission and council rejected those plans last year 
and asked the company to come back with plans for a smaller building. 
</P>
<P>
As part of Tuesday's approval, McBride Development must pay for improvements at 
the nearby intersection of Harbor and Bastanchury Road to ease the impact of 
more cars traveling to the building. 
</P>
<P>
Construction for the expanded office building probably will begin this fall, 
said James G. McGrade, vice president of the developer. TOM McQUEENEY

COMMISSION HONORS WIEDER, 3 OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder and three others have been honored by the 
Commission on the Status of Women as outstanding women in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Also honored were Shirley M. Metz of Capistrano Beach, Adleane Hunter of Santa 
Ana and Lucia Belle Isaacson of Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Metz made an overland journey on skis to the South Pole to point out the 
ecological danger facing the Earth and the pole. Hunter is the founder of the 
Orange County Black Actors Theater. Isaacson, 96, was an Army nurse in World 
War I who received a Purple Heart after being wounded while treating soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson was honored at her home while the others were presented their awards 
Tuesday at the Board of Supervisors meeting. The commission noted that Wieder 
was the first woman to be elected to the Board of Supervisors in its 100-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very honored to receive such a distinguished award, and I am happy to 
receive recognition for being the only woman who has served on the board," she 
said. "But I really hope that I will certainly not be the last." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the commission has made the awards.

3 STABBING SUSPECTS SURRENDER TO POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three local teen-agers, wanted in connection with a stabbing last weekend which 
allegedly involved members of an Orange County skinhead gang, surrendered to 
San Clemente police Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Witness identification of a car license plate led police to three youths 
suspected of involvement in a late-night confrontation Saturday which left one 
man in critical condition with a stab wound in the chest, Sgt. Richard Downing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. Bojorquez, owner of the car, and Jason B. Groves, both 18, were 
charged with assault with a deadly weapon and released on their own 
recognizance. A 16-year-old male also was booked on the same charge and 
released to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Timothy Wayne Mudd, 21, of San Clemente, told police that he and 
fellow San Clemente resident Jay Brody, 18, were walking on North El Camino 
Real to a nightclub when occupants of a white Volkswagen yelled out "O.C. 
Skins." 
</P>
<P>
When Brody shouted back the name of another skinhead group, the Volkswagen 
pulled into the parking lot of an Italian restaurant and three males jumped out 
and attacked the two San Clemente men, Brody told police. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd is recovering at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission 
Viejo. Brody suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Groves, in an interview, said, "We were playing rap music real loud and they 
hit Mike's (Bojorquez's) car with a rock." When they pulled over, he said, one 
youth struck him. 
</P>
<P>
Groves said he didn't see the stabbing and only learned about it as the three 
were driving away. Groves said it happened in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed that two knives were found at the scene but were unable to 
identify who owned them. 
</P>
<P>
All five subjects have told police that they were or are members of a skinhead 
gang, Downing said. FRANK MESSINA

MAN'S KILLER SOUGHT, MAY HAVE CUT HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police sought the assistance Wednesday of the medical community in solving the 
slaying of a 32-year-old Fullerton man. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Brian McNamara was discovered Tuesday at the Best Inn Motel in the 
8000 block of Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara was partly undressed and had been stabbed several times, Lt. John 
Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said money, possibly as much as $100 or more, was taken by McNamara's 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Woods said investigators believe that McNamara's attacker was injured and might 
have suffered cuts on his hand. "We are seeking assistance from the medical 
community as the suspect may seek medical treatment for injuries or already 
obtained it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have not recovered the murder weapon, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and motel officials said McNamara checked into the motel about 1 p.m. 
Monday and paid for an overnight stay. 
</P>
<P>
A maid discovered the body around 4 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"All she did was walk in and walked out when she saw blood everywhere on the 
carpet," said Retha Clinton, the motel manager's wife. "After she came and got 
me, I went in. He was lying on the floor between the bed and the wall. It was a 
terrible shock."

CANDIDATES DISAGREE ON POWER STRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight candidates seeking City Council seats in the April 10 election broke into 
two camps at a Wednesday forum in which the city's power structure became a 
central issue. 
</P>
<P>
One side said the city manager and city attorney have too much power. That 
group included incumbent John Kelly, 28, operator of a tuxedo shop; and 
challengers Berklee A. Maughan, 52, a retired financial executive, and Carole 
Bryant, 41, an accountant and business owner. They say the council, rather than 
the staff, should run the city. 
</P>
<P>
The other group contended that the city staff is competent and the power 
structure is appropriate. That camp included challengers Leslie A. Pontious, 
44, co-owner of a travel agency; Jim Potts, 36, a business owner and Irvine 
police sergeant; Dennis E. Pedersen, 42, a facilities construction manager; 
Charles E. (Chuck) Puckett, 47, district sales manager, and John Norman Butler, 
34, a real-estate broker. They say a strong council provides a system of checks 
and balances. 
</P>
<P>
Another power issue that split the candidates was the method of mayoral 
selection. Pontious, Pedersen, Puckett, Butler and Potts want to maintain the 
current method of selection, in which the council chooses the mayor. They say a 
member should earn the respect of his peers before serving as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Maughan and Kelly, who has never served as mayor, favor rotating the post while 
Bryant said voters should decide who becomes mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates also split on whether to limit council members to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, Maughan and Bryant said they favor limiting council terms to ensure 
turnover. Potts said he supports limiting terms if voters have the opportunity 
to keep a "shining star" in office longer than eight years. Pontious, Pedersen, 
Puckett and Butler said they oppose limiting terms because voters already have 
the power to turn council members out of office. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce, was broadcast live by 
Continental Cablevision. The program will be shown again at 8 p.m. Friday, 2 
p.m. March 31, and at an undetermined time on April 7. SHANNON SANDS

LAW ON CANDIDACY IS NEARING REPEAL

<P>
The City Council has taken the first step toward repealing a 20-year-old 
ordinance requiring members of city commissions to resign from those posts 
before running for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
James L. Markman recommended that the ordinance be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the ordinance as it sits can not be enforced. It interferes with the 
constitutional right to run for office," Markman said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the only restrictions that can be placed on candidates is that 
they must be registered voters and live in the cities where they are running 
for office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With city elections slated for November, the council decided to act 
immediately. By a 4-1 vote the first reading to repeal the ordinance was 
approved Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Don R. Griffin, who cast the dissenting vote, said that if the 
ordinance is repealed there are several potential conflicts of interest. One 
involves the City Council's ability to select the people who serve on the 
various commissions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want commission appointments to become a stepladder to use 
politically. I think individuals need to go in with the least amount of ties so 
they can represent all people," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune, who stepped down from the Planning Commission 
before taking her seat on the council, said she couldn't see the point of the 
ordinance. If it were repealed, she said, more people might become candidates. 
</P>
<P>
A final reading will be held at the next council meeting and, if passed, the 
repeal will go into effect in 30 days. LYNDA NATALI

ELECTION RIVAL BEGINS ROHRABACHER ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic congressional candidate Guy C. Kimbrough kicked off his campaign 
Wednesday at the Huntington Beach pier by attacking the environmental record of 
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita). 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough, a professor at Mt. 
</P>
<P>
San Jacinto College who lost to Rohrabacher in 1988, criticized his rival for 
supporting an increase in offshore oil drilling in the wake of Orange County's 
recent tanker spill. Kimbrough said he opposes any additional drilling off the 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
"As usual, he misses the big picture," Kimbrough said. "His position is 
wrongheaded and shortsighted." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher declined to comment on Kimbrough's charges Thursday. "My position 
will be that until the primary is over, I will not be answering to charges 
made," he said. He will respond to his Democratic opponents, he explained, only 
after one of them wins the party's nomination in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough and computer operator James Cavuoto are seeking the Democratic 
nomination to challenge the freshman Rohrabacher. The predominantly Republican 
42nd Congressional District straddles the boundary between Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, stretching along the coast from Huntington Beach to Rancho 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher defeated Kimbrough in the 1988 general election 64% to 33%. 
Kimbrough raised only $11,889, compared to almost $500,000 for Rohrabacher.DAVE

FULL METTLE JACKET: NATIONAL TEAM'S COAT MAKES DIFFERENCE FOR ESKILSSON; 
</P>
<P>
KAYAKING: FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT AT NEWPORT HARBOR STICKS WITH SPORT AFTER 
SEEING SWEDEN'S UNIFORM.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Put yourself in the same icy boat with Thomas Eskilsson and it's easy to 
understand the dilemma he faced four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Eskilsson, a foreign exchange student from Sweden who has attended Newport 
Harbor High School since last fall, was struggling to decide whether to quit 
kayaking, a sport he had practiced for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in Sweden, it's very, very hard to go down and kayak," said 
Eskilsson, who lives in Malmo in southern Sweden. "It's cold and it's very, 
very windy. The water comes up and gets in your jacket and freezes. The boat's 
all icy. You think, 'Oh, I'd rather stay in bed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the decision was Eskilsson's success at team handball, which is 
practiced in a cozy gym with teammates to provide inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing well in handball and I wasn't doing so well in kayaking," 
Eskilsson said. "I was very, very close to quitting kayaking." 
</P>
<P>
Then, out of the blue and dressed in blue, arrived the Swedish national 
kayaking team to quickly change his mind. Eskilsson was competing in Sweden's 
1987 junior national kayaking championships when he saw the national team 
wearing its team jackets. 
</P>
<P>
The blue jackets, with "Sweden" across the back in yellow letters, weren't 
fancy, but they made an impression on Eskilsson, who decided he would 
concentrate on kayaking. 
</P>
<P>
"They (team members) came in with their jackets on with 'Sweden' on the back 
and I said to my mom, 'One time in my life I am going to wear one of those 
jackets,' " Eskilsson said. "That really made a difference in my life. I wanted 
to have one of those jackets." 
</P>
<P>
He even made a good-natured bet with his mother, who teased that he wouldn't 
make the team, for dinner at a fancy restaurant. She lost. The next year 
Eskilsson earned the right to wear a jacket when he made the junior national 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Eskilsson, who has been a team member every year since, has developed into one 
of the best junior kayakers in the world. The 18-year-old won the Swedish 
junior national title in the 500 meters in 1988 and 1989 and placed sixth in 
the event in the 1989 junior world championships in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Eskilsson hopes his stay in Newport Beach, where he can take advantage of mild 
weather and work out daily, helps add to those accomplishments. He is only a 
short bike ride from Newport Aquatics Center in Newport Beach, where he trains, 
and his coach in Sweden sends him workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the best place in the world to practice kayaking," said 
Eskilsson, whose sister, Anna, is also attending Newport Harbor High School and 
staying with the same host family. "I've never practiced so much in the winter 
time. I've never been so prepared as this year." 
</P>
<P>
Eskilsson's competitiveness and preparation could prove to be a winning 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
His foreign exchange host father, Ralph Whitford, said Eskilsson was in a bad 
mood for two hours after Newport Harbor's football team lost in the Southern 
Section playoffs. It's not unusual for an athlete to be upset after a loss, but 
Eskilsson wasn't even on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He just has this competitive spirit that nothing is going to get in his way," 
said Whitford, whose son, Bill, is a youth development director for the U.S. 
Canoe and Kayaking Assn. in Hawaii and helped arrange Eskilsson's stay in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to lose, but I hate it," said Eskilsson, a starter and the 
third-leading scorer on Newport Harbor's soccer team. "If someone is better 
than me, if I work harder, I might be as well as them. Then, when you're as 
well as them, it's the guy who has the best shape of the day or the best race 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been lucky. I've had the best race of the day most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Orban, a member of the Swedish national kayaking team, expects that trend 
to continue. Orban, who has known Eskilsson for eight years, also trains at 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, he's perfect," Orban said of the 6-foot-1 Eskilsson. "He's light, 
but he's still strong. He takes off very fast. I think he can be the best 
paddler in the world in a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Such a timetable would suit Eskilsson, who hopes to reach his loftiest goal of 
competing in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona, Spain. His heart tells him to 
shoot for the '92 Games, his head says the '96 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-two might be too early," said Eskilsson, who will resume his studies 
and training at a school near Stockholm when he returns to Sweden in July. 
"I'll just be 20 then and most of the best guys are 28 or 29." 
</P>
<P>
Any feat that Eskilsson accomplishes, though, may not surpass the feeling he 
had when he put on the national team jacket for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"That was something I will never forget," Eskilsson said. "The first time I 
went out with my jacket and competed, I never had such a strong feeling for my 
country. I took the jacket in my hand and I said to my mom, 'I worked hard and 
this is the result.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy. And she was so happy even though she lost the bet."

FREEWAY SERIES OPENER TO BE TELEVISED

<TEXT>
<P>
Channel 5 plans to televise the Angels' Freeway Series opener with the Dodgers 
on April 6, KTLA officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 32-day lockout, KTLA had planned to broadcast two Angel spring 
training games, March 24 against San Francisco and March 25 against Seattle. 
The station will now televise only the April 6 Angel-Dodger game. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA's first regular-season telecast will be on April 17, when the Angels play 
the Oakland Athletics at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC (710), the Angels' radio flagship station, will air all 14 exhibition 
games, starting with Monday's game against San Diego in Yuma, Ariz. ELLIOTT

ONLY ARMAS' ABSENCE PREVENTS FULL HOUSE AT TRAINING CAMP

<TEXT>
<P>
Five of the six players who missed Tuesday's opening workout reported to Mesa 
Wednesday, leaving only non-roster player Tony Armas still out of camp. 
</P>
<P>
Angel officials said they had not heard from Armas, who spends the off-season 
in Venezuela, but assumed that he was having travel problems. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray, Claudell Washington, Chuck Finley, Brian Downing and Chili Davis, 
who were absent Tuesday, worked out with their teammates Wednesday. Finley said 
he was spending the holiday in New Orleans and didn't discover the lockout had 
ended until late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday? 
</P>
<P>
"It was St. Patrick's Day," he said. "So I didn't find out until late and then 
I didn't know they were working out (Tuesday.)" 
</P>
<P>
To make the most of their shortened spring training, the Angels have added two 
split-squad games and one B-squad game to their schedule, and might add another 
B-squad game in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
That will give them 14 exhibition games, still well short of the usual spring 
quotient. Their pre-lockout plan included 14 games in Arizona, 12 in Palm 
Springs and the three-game Freeway Series against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the re-revised schedule, the Angels will play split-squad games on March 
30 against the Chicago Cubs in Mesa and the Giants in Scottsdale, Ariz., and on 
March 31 against the Cleveland Indians in Tucson and the Athletics in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
A B-squad game has been added on March 27, when the Angels will be in Yuma to 
play the Padres, and another B-squad game is tentatively planned for April 3 in 
Palm Springs against the Padres' B-squad team. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kirk McCaskill can pad his victory total in the first three weeks of 
the season, when starting pitchers need to pitch three innings to earn a 
victory instead of the normal five, right-hander objected to the rule change. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it should have been done," said McCaskill, who had six complete 
games last season and pitched into the seventh or later 21 times. "It means you 
can't compare stats from this season to other seasons. And reality says that if 
you're breezing in the third, they're going to leave you in for the fourth and 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to change my role. I'm not going to be looking to the 
bullpen in the fourth inning -- unless I'm really struggling." 
</P>
<P>
Another lockout-related change got a "no" vote from Angel Manager Doug Rader. 
Rather than make up the first week's canceled games as doubleheaders later in 
the season or by adding a week of play in October, Rader would leave the 
schedule as it is. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think a shortened season would be appropriate," he said. 
"Doubleheaders at the end of the season are potentially very dangerous (because 
of fatigue) . . . And postseason play drags on so long after the season, I'd 
hate to see it go even longer." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smithson, who pitched for Rader in Texas in 1983, said Rader has mellowed 
out since they last teamed up. "He's changed for the better," Smithson said, 
recalling Rader's once-notorious escapades. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, who prefers to forget his bad old days, didn't smile at Smithson's 
remark. 
</P>
<P>
"Good," Rader said. "I hope he has (changed), too." 
</P>
<P>
The aches and pains that plague players during the season are forgotten over 
the long winter, but with spring training comes spring straining. 
</P>
<P>
It took only two workouts for first baseman Wally Joyner to realize that the 
season has started again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little tired and tight," he said. "You kind of forget the soreness 
coming into spring training. But you get a quick reminder." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Bob McClure says he hasn't been hurt by the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different for relievers. I'm ready," he said. "I'm not saying I'll get 
anybody out, but I'm ready."

DOLAN NO-HITTER LIFTS SAN CLEMENTE

SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pitcher Ken Dolan is off to an impressive start for the San Clemente High 
School baseball team this season, but you wouldn't know it by his record. 
</P>
<P>
In his first two starts, Dolan struck out 15 batters and allowed one earned 
run. For his efforts, he had an 0-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Dolan was more impressive, throwing a no-hitter against Capistrano 
Valley. And this time he even got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons made the most of Cougar mistakes and managed to hold their errors 
to a minimum for a 4-2 South Coast League victory at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of weeks my arm has been a little dead," said Dolan, a junior. 
"I took special care of it last night to get it loose. When I was warming up 
today, I knew I had my fastball with me." 
</P>
<P>
That was evident from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan kept the Cougars off-balance by mixing his fastball, which has been 
clocked at 86 miles per hour, with his knuckle curve. He struck out the first 
three batters he faced on 12 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
For the game, Dolan (1-2) struck out 10, including three of the last five 
batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
When the Cougars did manage to hit the ball, it didn't go far. Only one ball 
was hit out of the infield off Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
"When Kenny knows he's going against a good team, he gets really pumped up," 
San Clemente Coach Joe Miller said. "He seems to do well against quality 
opponents." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows that more than Capistrano Valley Coach Bob Zamora. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's game marked the third time in three seasons that Dolan has beaten 
the Cougars. As a freshman, he pitched a one-hitter against Capistrano Valley 
in only his second start on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Dolan allowed only five hits in a 2-1 victory over the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid seems to have our number," Zamora said. "His curveball is very 
difficult to read. By the time you do, it's past you." 
</P>
<P>
But Dolan almost gave the game away in the fourth inning. After breezing 
through the first nine batters, he opened the fourth by hitting Mike Lavin. The 
Tritons then made three errors that allowed the Cougars to score two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the errors were committed by Dolan. First, he booted a sacrifice bunt 
and later in the inning he made a throwing error, which allowed the Cougars to 
score their second run. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley might have had a bigger inning, but Dan Zamora was caught in 
a rundown to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I just blew it that inning," Dolan said. "I made an error and let it get to 
me. Fortunately, the team got me some runs early, so that inning didn't hurt me 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente (2-4 overall, 1-0 in league) gave Dolan an early lead by scoring 
four runs in the first inning. The Cougars (4-3, 0-1) lent a helping hand in 
the inning with an error, a passed ball and three wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Losing pitcher Travis Burgus (2-1) settled down after the first inning, 
allowing only one hit and striking out five in the final five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We just gave it away in the first," Zamora said. "Travis gave up four hits and 
struck out five. You would think he'd get a win with numbers like those." 
</P>
<P>
And he might have. Except Wednesday was Dolan's day. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 3, Dana Hills 1 -- Steve Evans allowed eight hits, struck out six 
and walked two (2-1) to lead Mission Viejo (3-2-1, 1-0). Don Disbro had a 
double and two runs batted in in the first inning for the Diablos. Dana Hills' 
Mike Robertson had four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 5, El Toro 4 (9 innings) -- Mike Seal's double in the bottom of the 
ninth inning drove in the winning run for Irvine (4-4, 1-0). Mark Huffman left 
off the bottom of the inning with his fourth hit. It was Seal's third hit. John 
Bretva (2-1) pitched all nine innings, striking out nine, walking two and 
allowing six hits.

HOUSING SALES SLOWING, TRW STUDY INDICATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first hard evidence that the long-expected slowdown in Orange County 
housing sales has finally arrived, TRW Real Estate Information Services said 
Wednesday that sales activity for February was at the lowest level in nearly 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Only 3,087 homes were sold in the county last month, down 2% from the 3,151 
sales reported in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the average price of homes sold last month was up 4.4% to 
$252,350 from $241,763 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
On a month-to-month basis, February's average price was down a scant 0.5% from 
$253,568 in January, while sales for the month were down 4.5% from 3,231 in 
January, TRW said. 
</P>
<P>
The TRW statistics track recorded sales of all types of single family housing 
-- new, resale, attached and detached. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Colton-based research firm said new homes accounted for 420 
sales in February, or 13.6% of total. That compares to 593 new home sales in 
February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Home resales in February numbered 2,667 units, up from 2,558 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics underscore both an overall slowing of sales and a specific 
problem in the new housing market, according to William Bereczky, a real estate 
consultant with the Newport Beach office of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
New home builders overestimated demand last year, he said, and ended 1989 with 
a sizable overstock, many in the higher-price ranges. Higher interest rates and 
other economic concerns have put a lid on the nearly frenzied home-buying that 
occurred in 1988 and most of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Leventhal study of new home inventories, Bereczky said, showed an 
unsold inventory at the end of 1989 of 1,344 single-family detached homes and 
756 attached units, contrasted with a figure of 323 detached and 199 attached 
units at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Builders overshot in estimating the market," he said.

PRICE IS NAMED CO-CEO TO EASE FHP TRANSITION

<P>
As a step in the transition of leadership, FHP International Corp. on Wednesday 
named Chief Operating Officer Wescott W. Price III to the additional position 
of co-chief executive officer, effective by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley-based company, which operates a health maintenance 
organization, said that Price will share the CEO's job with founder and 
chairman L. Robert Gumbiner until mid-November. Price will then become the 
firm's sole chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Gumbiner plans to retire from day-to-day operations but will 
remain as chairman of FHP International and its operating subsidiary, FHP Inc. 
He will also serve as a consultant to the company, which he founded in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Selwitz, a health-care analyst at Cruttenden &amp; Co. in Newport Beach, 
said the creation of a co-chief executive position is a mechanism for an 
orderly transition in FHP's management. He said the company has been grooming 
Price for the position. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbiner "hasn't been involved in the day-to-day operations for some time now," 
Selwitz said. "He has been more involved in (corporate) strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Price, 50, joined FHP in 1981 as a senior vice president. In 1987, he was named 
to succeed Gumbiner as president and chief operating officer of FHP Inc. and 
was appointed chairman of the company's executive management committee. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Gumbiner, who is FHP's largest shareholder with an 11.7% stake, led an 
18-member employee group that acquired the firm after it had been converted 
from a nonprofit to a for-profit concern. In 1986, the new owners took the 
company public. 
</P>
<P>
FHP's revenue has jumped from $500,000 in its first year in business to nearly 
$700 million for its fiscal year that ended June 30, 1989. FHP has 500,000 
members, 7,000 employees, and 45 medical facilities.

WHOSE SEX SECRET IS IT?; 
</P>
<P>
DO WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW A PUBLIC FIGURE'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION? RECENT 
DISCLOSURES BY GAY ACTIVISTS, MEDIA FUEL A BITTER DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malcolm Forbes, the flamboyant publisher known for his relationships with 
hot-air balloons and Elizabeth Taylor, had been dead only a week when rumors 
about his sexual orientation hit the mainstream media. 
</P>
<P>
In a USA Today gossip column, Forbes, the divorced father of five children and 
grandfather of nine, was described as "leading a gay lifestyle for at least the 
last five years." 
</P>
<P>
People magazine quickly offered similar observations, saying, "In recent years, 
Forbes' exuberant night life generated persistent if unproven rumors of his 
homosexuality" -- to which Forbes' son Robert offered no comment except, "Well, 
I don't like to see things about people's private lives in print." And last 
week, New York-based OutWeek, a gay-oriented weekly, followed with explicit 
details on the publishing tycoon's reported sex life. 
</P>
<P>
Though deceased, Forbes has become the latest target of "outing," a growing 
practice in which alleged gay men, lesbians or bisexuals are involuntarily 
yanked from the sexual closet, typically by activists in the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
But outing, or "tossing" as it's also called, is not confined to dead folks 
incapable of having their privacy invaded or being libeled and retaliating with 
lawsuits. In the last two years, the hotly debated tactic has flourished, 
flinging more and more living celebrities out of their private sexual sanctums 
and into newspapers and magazines, primarily the gay press and supermarket 
tabloids but, increasingly, mainstream media as well. 
</P>
<P>
In virtually all cases, outing is reserved for people who are already well 
known. Actors, politicians, gossip columnists and fashion designers have been 
named, usually by proud, open gays who, in some cases, claim to personally know 
the purported sex partners of those they expose. Well-known writers, 
entertainment moguls, professional athletes, Olympic medalists, rock musicians 
-- or sometimes their reportedly gay or lesbian children -- also have been 
tossed. Long practiced in private conversations in gay circles, outing now 
occurs on public placards at AIDS demonstrations. It happens in lectures. And 
it appears regularly in the gay press, in interviews with activists and in 
OutWeek's notorious "Peek-a-Boo" feature, which is simply a list of names of 
famous people supposedly in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
The practice is generating vigorous debate. In the gay community, outing -- or 
the threat of it -- is criticized by some as a form of psychological terrorism 
and hailed by others as a powerful political tool. While opponents argue that 
revealing anyone's sexual orientation is an inexcusable invasion of privacy, 
many say outing represents the cutting edge of gay activism in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Perpetrators contend that if the sexual orientation of respected, 
high-visibility gays and lesbians were revealed, others who are in or out of 
the closet would have more role models to consider -- not just deceased media 
stars such as Rock Hudson, Liberace, attorney Roy Cohn, fashion designer Perry 
Ellis and National Conservative Political Action Committee founder Terry Dolan, 
all of whose sexual orientations were exposed as a result of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Award-winning playwright Larry Kramer, an advocate of outing whose plays "The 
Normal Heart" and "Just Say No" obliquely reveal allegedly closeted gays in 
politics and in the entertainment industry, claims the large number of people 
hiding out is the reason gays lack the political clout other minorities have 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm HIV-positive and I haven't got time to wait for 25 million (gay and 
lesbian) people to get their act together to help make the government pay 
attention to my illness and help save my life," Kramer insists, volunteering, 
incidentally, that he hates the term outing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to do it to a school teacher or someone like that, but I get 
very angry with people who are in a position to do good, like heads of studios, 
famous stars, politicians certainly, authors, sports stars -- people who could 
be role models for a community that desperately needs them," adds Kramer, who 
is also founder of the militant AIDS activist organization ACT UP. "We're 
fighting for our lives now." 
</P>
<P>
Some supporters of outing are elected officials in high political office. U.S. 
Reps. Barney Frank and Gerry Studds, both of whom are openly gay, strongly back 
individuals' rights to privacy but believe that outing is justified in certain 
instances. 
</P>
<P>
"Where there are gay people who are engaged in gay bashing, they forfeit their 
right to privacy in general. They're hypocrites and they should be brought 
out," says Frank (D-Mass), noting that he voluntarily disclosed that he was gay 
after the press asked him about it in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Frank threatened to do some political outing of his own. He warned 
that he might name the names of secretly gay Republican officeholders after a 
Republican National Committee memo falsely implied that House Speaker Thomas 
Foley, a Democrat, was gay. 
</P>
<P>
Frank never followed through with his closet shakedown. But two months after he 
threatened to expose others, a sexual secret of his own was revealed in the 
news. Responding to published accusations by a former personal aide, Frank 
admitted he had employed the man as an aide, then fired him after learning he 
was using the congressman's apartment as a house of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Like Frank, Studds represents Massachusetts. He has survived a gay sex scandal 
(he was censured in 1983 for acknowledging having had sex with a teen-age male 
page). And he, too, has been reelected since declaring he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me an ethical case could be made for denying someone their right 
to privacy if their conduct threatens other people's lives," reasons Studds. He 
offers, as an example of a potential outing candidate, a politician who is 
"actively and effectively lobbying against AIDS legislation or AIDS education 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Forced from the closet himself when the page scandal broke seven years ago, 
Studds says he would have preferred to have come out voluntarily than to have 
been outed by the disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I certainly wouldn't have chosen that method or timing," he allows. And 
though Studds doesn't recast his experience as a blessing in disguise, he does 
say that "what could have been an unmitigated disaster has been turned into a 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
But before anyone else is abruptly exposed the way he was, Studds would like to 
see other strategies tried first. "If the hypocrisy reaches a certain level, 
the proper thing is to send someone quietly to speak with them, to give them 
fair notice," the congressman recommends. "And if they continue to do things 
that really threaten, then I think you could make a case for outing." 
</P>
<P>
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's Robert Bray has engaged in some of 
the alternative tactics Studds suggests. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the task force is we uphold privacy in all cases no matter who 
the individual is or what their status is," says Bray, the task force's public 
information director. "The central issue of the national gay and lesbian 
movement is freedom, and we believe that coming out of the closet is an 
entirely personal and private decision that only an individual can make." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bray points out that there is pervasive discrimination and 
defamation against gays throughout the country -- "some of it perpetrated by 
gays who are in high public office." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when Bray was dancing at a gay club in the nation's capital and 
recognized a member of Congress who had voted against pro-gay legislation, he 
took action. 
</P>
<P>
"I spotted this gentleman dancing with his boyfriend. . . . Instead of tossing 
or outing this congressman, I introduced myself on the dance floor and called 
to his attention the hypocrisy that he had been legislating against gays. He 
left the bar. He didn't say anything. But I think he got the message. He 
started voting pro-gay and has been ever since. Outing would have been 
inappropriate in his case." 
</P>
<P>
Some well-known outing activists such as San Francisco-based novelist Armistead 
Maupin claim to have been exposing famous gay or lesbian hypocrites for as long 
as 12 years. (Among those Maupin revealed last year during an interview in San 
Francisco-based Gay Book magazine were a top Hollywood studio head, a popular 
record producer, several married actors, a real estate mogul and a married 
fashion designer. Maupin declined to be interviewed for this article, saying, 
through a spokesman, that he didn't want to be known as a premier outing 
activist.) 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, as outing becomes more high-profile, the debate over whether 
it should be done "is just getting under way in the gay and lesbian community," 
says OutWeek Editor Gabriel Rotello. 
</P>
<P>
Bray recalls the first time outing was seriously discussed at a national forum: 
"In 1987, the issue of homophobic homosexual leaders was brought up at the 'Gay 
and Lesbian War Conference' in Washington, D.C., a convening of a couple of 
dozen gay and lesbian and AIDS leaders nationwide to discuss strategy. The camp 
swarmed (on the issue of outing)." 
</P>
<P>
Today, he says, the ranks remain divided. In fact, many gays find the notion of 
outing disturbing and counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
"Heavily closeted gays and lesbians who have to be dragged kicking and 
screaming from the closet don't make very good role models," advises gay 
psychologist Paul Froman, a Los Angles-based member of the California State 
Task Force to Promote Self Esteem and Social and Personal Responsibility. If 
people need help in coming out, he suggests participation in National Coming 
Out Day each October, a celebratory occasion on which Froman says thousands of 
individuals have revealed their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Kellogg, the former editor in chief of The Advocate, the biweekly gay 
news magazine based in Los Angeles, agrees that forced disclosures of sexual 
orientation do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
"If people voluntarily come out of the closet that can go a long way towards 
saving young people's lives," says Kellogg, who resigned from his post last 
week to write books. "Many (closeted) gay people either live . . . dishonestly 
unhappy lives, kill themselves or do something close to killing themselves 
because of their depression. If someone they already honor comes out, and comes 
out voluntarily, it illustrates that homosexuality is not something to be 
apologized for. But if somebody is discovered to be gay, it just underscores 
the (perceived) need for people to be secret." 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg, whose publication generally avoids outing but printed the name of an 
anti-gay politician subjected to it, also notes that gay people have 
considerable investment in privacy law. "That's where we're going to get 
effective gay-rights laws," he predicts. "If we don't want Georgia policemen, 
for example, coming into our private bedrooms, we'd better look out for other 
people's privacy as well." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Peterson, The Advocate's Western region correspondent, has repeatedly 
reported on outing and says he understands the anger and frustrations from 
which it springs. Yet he still disapproves: "I think there's going to be an 
incredible reaction within the gay community at these tactics and their 
destructiveness. There's nothing to be gained from outing. . . . And the public 
at large will never respect a group of people that cannibalizes its own." 
</P>
<P>
Responds Michelangelo Signorile, the OutWeek feature editor who wrote the story 
on Forbes, "I see (outing) as teaching our own. I want to be able to tell the 
kids who are gay who they can look up to." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, are publications that name closeted gays opening themselves to 
lawsuits? Signorile says no libel or invasion-of-privacy suits have been filed 
or threatened against OutWeek. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Abrams, a highly regarded New York-based constitutional attorney, says 
it's hard to tell whether, if filed, such suits would be successful: "It would 
not be a frivolous claim for someone who leads an entirely private gay life -- 
and whose sexual orientation is disclosed solely for the purpose of disclosure 
-- to bring an action claiming a violation of his rights. There could be a very 
serious First Amendment response because this area has not been ruled upon by 
the Supreme Court. Even if someone were a public figure . . . there would be a 
good deal of jockeying in the courts before we knew the answer to the question 
about his rights." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Oliver Sipple, the gay Vietnam veteran who became a public 
figure in 1975 when he knocked away the revolver fired at President Gerald Ford 
by Sara Jane Moore, the legal jockeying lasted several years. 
</P>
<P>
After Sipple was lauded as a hero, his friends disclosed to newspaper reporters 
that he was active in gay social and political circles. The stories, in effect, 
outed Sipple and were big news to his family back in Detroit. Sipple sued seven 
major newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, claiming his privacy had 
been invaded. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that the revelation increased his psychological problems, created 
an estrangement from his parents and was responsible for his increased 
drinking. His lawsuit was thrown out by a San Francisco Superior Court judge. 
But the case dragged on. In 1985, he lost again when a state Court of Appeal 
held that Sipple had become newsworthy and that his sexual orientation was part 
of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Sipple was found dead last year in his $344-a-month San Francisco apartment, 
surrounded by bottles of bourbon and 7-Up. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exposures of sexual orientation increase, and both the straight and 
the gay media are grappling with the ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person is gay and is in a successful undertaking, what right do we have 
to probe into that (sex life) as long as the person is doing a responsible 
job?" asks press critic Norman Issacs, the former associate dean of Columbia 
University's Graduate School of Journalism and author of "Untended Gates: The 
Mismanaged Press." 
</P>
<P>
"We're so damn careless all the time. It looks to me as if Western society is 
kind of on the brink of withdrawal from the whole system of values and 
obligations. . . . The cruddy press (supermarket tabloids) is starting to be 
the tail that wags the dog. Every time they come up with something, boom, there 
we (mainstream media) are. We start to quote them as if they're important." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for example, in a story on the outing phenomenon in the San 
Francisco Chronicle, the names of an allegedly closeted gay fashion designer 
and the reportedly undeclared lesbian daughter of a famed pop star were named. 
</P>
<P>
The article repeated a name that appeared in OutWeek magazine and another from 
a supermarket tabloid story. The Chronicle report did not include evidence to 
substantiate the claims of sexual orientation and did not offer responses from 
the individuals who were named. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote this story because there is a debate taking place in the gay 
community and there's a sizable gay community in San Francisco," says Chronicle 
City Editor Dan Rosenheim. "People were mentioned in passing. All of the people 
have been the object of articles in the gay and the straight press. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't feel we were telling anybody anything that's new by mentioning that 
these people's names came up in the debates," notes Rosenheim, adding that 
millions of people had already read about the pop star's daughter in 
supermarket tabloids and that the fashion designer's supposed sexual 
orientation had been written about "extensively" in the gay press and also in a 
gossip column by Liz Smith of the New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is not to intrude into the private lives of people," he says. "Our 
interest was not in spreading rumors but in airing those aspects of a debate 
that is growing and important and significant." 
</P>
<P>
USA Today Editor in Chief Peter Prichard, whose newspaper appears to be the 
first mainstream publication to disclose the information on Forbes' reported 
sex life, says his paper has no overall policy on outing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of story you have to judge on a case-by-case basis," Prichard 
says. "I thought it was newsworthy because there were books coming out that 
dealt with the topic, and there are certainly few people in America who led a 
more public life than Malcolm Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
"Here was something that was new, that he had kept private, but that other 
organizations and publications within the gay community thought that he should 
have gone public with. They were going to make that an issue in OutWeek and saw 
this as an emerging issue in the '90s. We talked about it and thought it was 
newsworthy." 
</P>
<P>
As difficult as such decisions concerning ethics and newsworthiness may be, 
equally challenging are the public relations issues that outing raises for the 
gay community, in the view of Hunter Madsen, who, with Marshall Kirk, 
co-authored "After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of 
Gays in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Madsen and Kirk have recommended that gays adopt a program of tact, 
self-restraint and empathy for the fears and concerns of straight people. 
Outing, says Madsen, is the opposite strategy: "a form of psychological 
terrorism that looks ugly both to gays and to straights." 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out is the major trauma in every gay person's life," explains the 
author, a San Francisco-based advertising executive who is openly gay. "To 
raise the specter of a witch hunt by your own community only makes that process 
more difficult. Blackmail has long been used by straights against gays to get 
what they want. It's not surprising that blackmail should occur as a technique 
among the most radical gays. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot support a society which routinely resorts to blackmail of its 
citizens to get what it wants, whether that society is the United States or the 
gay community within it. It takes a certain coldness, a certain hardness of 
heart about the personal trauma of coming out to insist that others do it or 
else." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are desperate," replies OutWeek's Signorile. "When your best 
friends are dying all around you and you turn to actor B and he's doing nothing 
about it, but he's making millions of dollars, you get very resentful. This is 
going to be the debate of the '90s in the gay community. Everybody thought that 
the issue of domestic partnership versus marriage was going to be the big 
debate. But this is the debate." For now. While proponents and opponents of 
outing expect the phenomenon to intensify for a while, they also see the tactic 
eventually becoming unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The closet is now an archaic relic of the past and it's existing on its own 
momentum," reflects OutWeek editor Rotello. "Someone's just going to have to 
break that logjam. Once it breaks, gays and lesbians will come flying out of 
the closet and people will see that they're everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Madsen figures that outing will be "rendered irrelevant, unnecessary within the 
decade" because large numbers of gays are now coming out. 
</P>
<P>
"Very soon, a level of legitimacy will be gained," he enthuses. "It doesn't 
take much. It only takes the sense that gays are coming out everywhere for 
those sitting on the fence to reason that perhaps the risks are not so great 
after all."

JOSEPH N. BELL: BOTTOM LINE SINKS CONCERTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't have a vengeful bone in my body -- except, of course, for the Baseball 
Owners of America and the people who converted KFAC from a classical to a rock 
radio station. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the strike is over, the baseball owners haven't gotten their 
comeuppance and probably won't, since by the time their ballparks open, we'll 
all come pouring in, overcome with relief if not gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
But KFAC is a different story. I'll have to admit that when I read in The Times 
the other day that KKBT -- which replaced KFAC -- had fallen flat on its face 
with its rock format, I felt nothing but glee. And from the amount of mail I've 
received on this subject, I suspect a lot of other Orange Countians felt the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
You know the background. This high-powered outfit called Evergreen Media Corp. 
bought KFAC for $55 million, then said it couldn't support its debt service 
with a classical music format and would have to change it to rock. And while 
classical music lovers bled copiously, KFAC became KKBT, the zillionth rock 
station in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, station manager Jim de Castro was quoted as saying: "The minute we 
switch, we will be delivering at least five times the audience and delivering 
much, much more of the type of sound that the L.A. market requests." 
</P>
<P>
Well, by golly, it didn't turn out that way. While classical music lovers 
inundated newspapers with vitriolic letters, KKBT was born, tried to walk, and 
fell on its keister. According to the February Arbitron ratings, KKBT came in 
36th, 14 places below KFAC's last rating before it was put up against the wall 
and executed. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of this disaster, de Castro said the station was going to "stick to 
its guns," which didn't seem very smart. But shortly afterward, it turned to a 
new format it calls "urban contemporary." Presumably, this will be better for 
its debt service. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KUSC-FM (91.5) has increased its classical programming, and KKGO-FM 
(105.1) with a strong signal and creative programming is offering classical 
music around the clock. They have even -- God bless them -- brought back the 
Gas Co. evening concert. 
</P>
<P>
All this has pleased the classical music lovers who have written to me, but one 
question keeps coming up: Why can't we have a classical music station in Orange 
County? 
</P>
<P>
So I called Allan Klein in Encino. He's one of the leading consultants in the 
radio field in Southern California and once worked out of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"How about it?" I asked him. "Do you think a classical music station could make 
it in Orange County?" 
</P>
<P>
"My instincts tell me 'No,' " he said. "A classical music station would have to 
move into an ongoing facility that fully covers the market, and there are very 
few such stations in Orange County. And the owners would have to be able to buy 
at a reasonable price commensurate with the income a classical music station 
would deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"Classical is not a mainstream format, you know. Most Orange County stations 
exist off local retail sales, and classical music is not appropriate to a 
retail driven media, partly because it has primarily an upper age appeal. Also, 
most Orange County radio signals are marginal. About 90% of Orange County 
listening is to Los Angeles radio." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, that's all well and good, but wasn't KFAC making it pretty well before 
the Philistines took over? 
</P>
<P>
"KFAC was around for a long time, and the old owners really knew how to sell 
the station. It never got more than a 1.5 share of the market, but that was 
enough to be profitable because it didn't have a $50-million note to pay off. 
The new owners do. They were willing to pay that kind of money because they 
knew they were getting a facility that offers the potential of a lot of both 
bucks and power." 
</P>
<P>
Bucks and power. A poetic letter writer named John Goetz caught this in verse: 
</P>
<P>
 No more KFAC and Bach, 
</P>
<P>
 Instead KKBT schlockrock. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus with Philistine conniving 
</P>
<P>
 Music matches advertising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I asked Klein if he considered the possibility of a classical music station in 
Orange County hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
He thought that over for a moment and said: "The only way I could see it 
working is by subscription, if it went on the air and said: 'Look, we need $3 
million a year to survive and we're not going to sell any advertising so we'll 
have to get it from our listeners.' I wonder how many of the classical music 
lovers who have been writing you letters would be willing to put up $100 a year 
for a station in Orange County? That's the only way I can see it happening." 
</P>
<P>
I wonder, too. I also wonder if some of the people who have become very rich in 
Orange County would be willing to underwrite a piece of a classical music 
station. Or if one of Orange County's colleges or universities would broadcast 
classical music as KUSC does? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the world we live in isn't all bucks and power. It's easy and tempting to 
write it off that way -- and there is surely plenty of evidence. But I asked 
Klein if Orange Countians found some way to underwrite such a station, could we 
come back to him? 
</P>
<P>
He laughed and said, "Sure," but it was clear he doesn't expect it to happen. I 
guess I don't either. 
</P>
<P>
Bucks and power seem to have taken over.

FAMILY LIFE: AA DESERVES A SOBER LOOK AT ITS SUCCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I sometimes think people have more knowledge of the secret rites of Free Masons 
than they do of the workings and the accomplishments of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Odd indeed for an organization that's been around for more than a half-century 
and is a lot more open than your average session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's that very openness and simplicity of operation that confuses the 
cynics among us and sends them digging for ulterior motives or "unknown 
secrets" of the group. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example of this silliness appears in the March issue of Los Angeles 
magazine under the headline "Is AA the New EST?" 
</P>
<P>
And while I must admit the author does a fairly good job with the basics, she 
is thwarted at every turn by the editors, who blow up every elbow-in-the-side 
line in the piece. 
</P>
<P>
"At AA . . . you can not only lose an addiction, you can network yourself silly 
-- even find a spouse," reads one headline outtake. 
</P>
<P>
"Recovering substance abusers have hit the lecture circuits and they're 
grabbing fees ranging from Margaux Hemingway's low ball $5,000 a shot to Stacy 
Keach's $25,000," says another. 
</P>
<P>
The main indictment of the article seems to be that "abstinence is chic," the 
"in thing" of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Which is OK with me -- and I would think anyone else who knows the statistics 
on the destruction alcohol and drugs have wreaked on family life and our 
society as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
What concerns me here, though, is the presentation of AA as a fad not far 
removed from Ouija boards or crystal pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
And because Alcoholics Anonymous has no national spokesperson (or officials of 
any sort for that matter) to set the record straight, please indulge me for a 
few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
AA had its beginnings in the late 1930s when two longtime alcoholics discovered 
that they could keep each other sober by sitting down and discussing their 
common problems. 
</P>
<P>
After they had succeeded for a while and their circle grew to more than 100, 
they published a book called simply "Alcoholics Anonymous" in which they told 
their own stories and outlined the steps that had worked for them. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect they had a pretty good knowledge of history because they adroitly 
sidestepped some pitfalls that destroyed a similar movement in the 1800s called 
the Washingtonians (after George). 
</P>
<P>
The Washingtonians were also a group of alcoholics who got together to help 
each other stop drinking and "to keep sober those who are sober." 
</P>
<P>
By the 1840s, they had grown to about 600,000 and were taken over by 
evangelical ministers and others who saw them as a potential national political 
force. When the group's goals changed from keeping people sober to electing 
politicians, it was doomed. 
</P>
<P>
AA's founders wisely decreed anonymity for all members and stressed in the 
forward to the book: "We are not allied with any particular faith, sect or 
denomination, nor do we oppose anyone. We simply wish to be helpful to those 
who are afflicted." 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, AA came up with some rules, called the "Twelve Traditions," to clarify 
its goals and further ensure its independence. Among them are the determination 
that AA should "never become organized," that it have "no opinion on outside 
issues," and that (are you listening, Margaux and Stacy?) "we need always 
maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films." 
</P>
<P>
Eligibility for membership is simply "the desire to stop drinking." There are 
no secret handshakes, initiation rites, membership cards, oaths or funny hats. 
There aren't even any dues. 
</P>
<P>
Just a bunch of people from all walks of life sitting around sharing their 
experiences and hopes one day at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that AA works is attested to by the millions of alcoholics around the 
world who have turned their lives around in the 50 years since the group was 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely how it works is more of a mystery, even to those who practice its 
principles in their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I have all the willpower of a cocker spaniel in heat," says one member. "I 
can't stop smoking, I can't stay on a diet and I can't let loose of old 
resentments and relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"But, more than a dozen years ago, I went to my first AA meeting and was able 
to walk away from what had become a routine of drinking more than a quart of 
gin a day." 
</P>
<P>
All that matters to him -- and, it seems to me, that should matter to the rest 
of us -- is that it works. 
</P>
<P>
EST should be so lucky.

FETE FOR DEVELOPER RAISES $300,000 FOR CITY OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MARIN, Pamela Marin is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local land barons honored one of their own last week at a big-ticket dinner 
that raised $300,000 for the City of Hope, a cancer research and treatment 
center in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
South County developer Kathryn Thompson was this year's recipient of the annual 
Spirit of Life award given by the Construction Industries Alliance, a 
fund-raising group for the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 builders, developers and members of related industries paid $250 each 
to attend the awards dinner on Thursday at the Irvine Hilton and Towers. 
Benefit proceeds will be used for a research project of Thompson's designation, 
said City of Hope spokesman Ernie Spickler. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have the money, we're going to ask her what she'd like it to go 
for, what kinds of projects interest her," he said. In the meantime, the 
"Kathryn G. Thompson Research Fellowship" money will be deposited in the 
medical center's general fund, Spickler said. 
</P>
<P>
Crooner Pat Boone emceed the awards ceremony, revealing, in his opening 
comments, that his 81-year-old "Daddy" was a builder in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
"Daddy would be in hog heaven tonight," Boone told the builder big shots. 
</P>
<P>
Tapped for speeches were Alliance chairman John Lusk and Alliance president 
William Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Lusk, who read a five-minute pep talk from index cards, described the 93-acre, 
55-building City of Hope facility and said it operates on an annual budget of 
$164 million. 
</P>
<P>
He also sang the praises of volunteerism, giving a mixed-metaphor nod to his 
industry comrades: "There would be no City of Hope without the dedicated army 
of volunteers which make up the nationwide City of Hope family." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon followed with words about the honoree. "She's certainly all those great 
things that have been said about her at many award dinners like this before," 
he said, "so I won't dwell on her long and illustrious resume." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon said Thompson "belongs to more organizations than anybody I know" and has 
contributed money "clear out of proportion to what others have done." 
</P>
<P>
He got the biggest laugh of the evening with this sequence: 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been easy for Kathryn to be a builder in a man's world. Kathryn is a 
very beautiful woman, and it's disarming. Most men in business are disarmed 
(by) a beautiful woman, but they all relate that somehow to an airhead. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathryn is not an airhead." 
</P>
<P>
The dinner committee was headed by William Lusk, James McNamara, Daniel Ciauri 
and Pat Poss. 
</P>
<P>
Seated with Thompson and her husband, Gus Owen, were Thompson's parents, Nita 
and Marvin Gore; Father Michael Harris, from Santa Margarita High School in 
Rancho Santa Margarita; Roger Johnson, chairman of Western Digital; George 
Engdahl, vice president of development, Orange County Performing Arts Center; 
and Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and his wife, Emma Jane.

SEA SCOUT VESSEL IN NEED OF REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Climb aboard the Tall Ship Argus in Newport Beach and help the Sea Scouts -- 
members of the Orange County Council of Boy Scouts of America -- repair her 
rotting planks and send her back to sea. 
</P>
<P>
The Argus, formerly a Baltic trader, was built in Denmark in the early 1900s. 
The boat was used to haul cement and lumber, but is now used exclusively by the 
Boy Scouts of America for sail training. 
</P>
<P>
The Argus is docked at the Boy Scouts Sea Base with no open sea in sight until 
some of its planks are replaced. "What we are doing is required by the Coast 
Guard," said Sea Base director Mickey Hunter. "We have to replace the planking 
above the water line on the sides of the ship. We cannot have the work done in 
a shipyard because of the high labor costs, and pulling the Argus out of the 
water is very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Scouts use the Argus for weekend training cruises to Santa Catalina 
Island during the spring and summer, and for five-day summer cruises to Santa 
Cruz and other Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our spring cruises have already been canceled due to the work (needed) 
on the boat," Hunter said. "Hopefully, we will have the work completed sometime 
in the middle of May. If we could have six volunteers working a day, that would 
be great. Weekends we do OK, but during the week we only have half as many 
volunteers, or some days none at all." 
</P>
<P>
J.R. Warther, the ship's carpenter and the only paid worker on the Argus, 
directs the volunteers and the work aboard the ship. "The sea base has been 
lucky enough to have a few skilled workers, such as a master cabinet maker, 
(and) we have gotten a lot of quality workers who have previously worked as 
college professors to truck drivers. We try to figure what people can do and 
set them up with a job they can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Adults with or without experience in wooden ship maintenance should contact 
Mickey Hunter at the Boy Scout Sea Base, 1931 W. Coast Highway, Newport Beach, 
(714) 642-5031.

STATE WRITING SCORES FOR 8TH -- GRADERS; 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are the school-by-school results of the California Assessment Program's 
writing exam that was administered to eighth-graders throughout the state last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
The exam consists of eight tests of writing ability and represents the state's 
biggest step to date away from the much-criticized multiple-choice method of 
testing academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Results are listed by school district and by individual school so that parents 
can compare the performance of youngsters in their community with that of 
students in the rest of Los Angeles County and throughout California. (Schools 
are listed alphabetically by district.) 
</P>
<P>
Because the exam was changed substantially last year with the addition of two 
more writing tests, only the latest round of scores is listed. 
</P>
<P>
The scaled score is a combination of results on each of the eight separate 
writing tests. The statewide average score was 255 for eighth-graders, and the 
average in Los Angeles County was 230. 
</P>
<P>
Relative rank is a way to compare a district or school with another that is 
similar to it in terms of student ethnic and socioeconomic makeup and students' 
ability to speak English fluently, as well as how often those students move 
from school to school. 
</P>
<P>
State rank shows the school or district's rank (on a scale of 1 to 99), 
comparing its scores to scores of every other school or district in the state.

Army cuts -- The Times erroneously reported Wednesday that the Army expects to 
cut 17,000 servicemen and women from its rolls by 1994. The service plans to 
reduce its ranks by 17,000 in fiscal year 1991 and by a total of 135,000 
soldiers by 1994.

'LITTLE SANTA ANA' GROWS UP

<P>
It's a far cry from the race track, but this "little Santa Ana" is 
appropriately named for its predominantly Latino residents: Anita is a nickname 
for the name Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses are single-story, single-family residences, for the most part 
encircled by fences: chain-link, wrought-iron, wood. There are children -- lots 
of them, for this is a very young neighborhood. About one-third of the 
residents are less than 15 years old, and the median age is 23. 
</P>
<P>
And there are gangs, or so the graffiti would suggest. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three dogs of various ages amble along on the less-traveled streets -- 
and so does a rooster, which crosses Susan Street oblivious to traffic. (Susan 
Street, after all, was just an unpaved, dirt road until as recently as a couple 
of years ago.) A car and a small truck stop, and the drivers courteously watch 
the bird go by. 
</P>
<P>
This is a barrio in the true sense of the word, a Spanish-speaking neighborhood 
complete with street life, Santa Ana-style. Lawns are well-tended, but the 
sprinkler systems are the residents themselves wielding garden hoses. Homes of 
longtime residents accommodate as many as three generations, in the Latino 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case with Erma Garcia, whose daughter's family lives with Erma and 
her husband. She remembers Santa Anita before there were sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the years, the appearance has improved," says Garcia, a bilingual 
teaching aide at the Edward Lee Russell Elementary School. "We didn't have a 
crosswalk on First and Jackson. We fought to have a traffic light put in there. 
We didn't have sidewalks there (either)." But now they do. 
</P>
<P>
"We have little gangs here and there; once in a while there are shootings. It's 
not perfect, but there are more opportunities, more and more kids that are 
going to college." 
</P>
<P>
One thing would make the neighborhood complete. "We wish we could get rid of 
the drug pushers," she muses. "If we could, that would be heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia thinks parental involvement is instrumental in keeping kids off drugs. 
Parents have to pay attention to what their children are doing. "We have to do 
that so they won't stray," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years Garcia herself has called parents and told them what their kids 
were doing. "They (the kids) used to call me La Migra (slang for immigration)," 
she remembers. "I'd come around and they would hide." But some of those kids 
later thanked her for helping to keep them off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Jimerson, a representative from the Figueroa Center, a division of 
Santa Ana Recreation and Community Services, seconds Garcia's visual evaluation 
but sees the drug presence differently. "The area has really improved a lot," 
she says. "(It) used to have a lot of homeless, a lot of drugs. We don't have 
that problem anymore." The center sponsors a program called Pride that brings 
children together to keep them off drugs and out of gangs. "As long as we can 
keep the kids involved and keep them off the street, we'll have a better 
neighborhood," Jimerson says. The group meets every Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Robert Helton of the Santa Ana Police Department Community Relations also 
thinks the Santa Anita area has been improving. "We don't have the requests for 
police activity as we did in the early '80s," he notes. "Overall crime is not 
the same. Gangs had the reputation of being a very strong entity (then), but 
they no longer have the same recognition they once did." 
</P>
<P>
There is still some gang activity, some residential burglaries, he says, "but 
not reminiscent of the way it was years ago. It's one of those cyclical 
things." He points to the new businesses along Harbor Boulevard and the new 
homes being built as improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Most striking is Bentley Parke, a set of bright, white apartment buildings 
built two years ago and enclosed by a fence, rising along First Street east of 
Susan Street. The rental units in the two-story complexes are competitively 
priced by Orange County standards -- $660 for one bedroom, $795 for two 
bedrooms. But in a neighborhood where the median family income is about $22,000 
a year, those rates could absorb a substantial part of a family's income. 
</P>
<P>
Even at that, there is no guarantee of safety. "Ask the rental office just how 
secure it is," says Helen Brown, director of the Civic Center Barrio Housing 
Corp., which specializes in low-income housing. "The homeboys on Jackson Street 
are just saying, 'Great, a new place to do our midnight shopping.' It's not the 
yuppies of Orange County (living) in this planned-unit community. It's more 
low-income people -- overcrowding just to pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a grave need to have properties brought up to a level beyond simple 
decency, to where they're a plus in the neighborhood," Brown continues. There's 
a drive "to make lower-income units compatible to neighborhoods around them. In 
fact, (the city) wants to change the complexion of the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Erma Garcia thinks police officers take complaints of crime made in wealthier 
areas in Santa Ana more seriously than those made in lower-income areas. "We 
don't get very good service from the Police Department," she says. "What we 
really resent is that they will do better things for better neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Helton's assertion that the crime picture is better than it used to be, 
residents think the decline is not in the number of calls to police that are 
made but in the number of times the police have responded. 
</P>
<P>
"When we call, they want us to go out there and tell if we saw the shooting, if 
we saw the gun," says Garcia. "They have to come to the aid (of the caller) 
when someone's getting shot. We resent that they won't come when we need them." 
</P>
<P>
"If the citizen can tell specifically (where the shooting occurred), we will 
come immediately," Helton explains. "We typically ask where the gunshots are 
coming from. The way sound travels, we wouldn't know" where to dispatch the 
squad car to without a specific location. The best the police can do is "take 
the information and broadcast to the patrol officers that gunshots were heard 
in a particular area." 
</P>
<P>
One measure that Santa Anita is a true neighborhood is the cooperation that 
residents have shown in collecting signatures and filing petitions with the 
city to shut down two bars that have been sites of drug activity. "We had a lot 
of people that would cooperate, signing petitions, getting together," says 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
She targets the parking lot at the Candlelight Bar at First and Laurel streets 
as one of the remaining offensive sites. "There's a lot going on (there), 
pushing drugs, streetwalkers doing business, doing whatever they're doing in 
the car. The police get called and they never come," Garcia explains. The bar 
was closed for a while but subsequently reopened. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a priority system," Helton explains. In-progress crimes get immediate 
attention, he says. And it's not that the police never arrive but that "there 
may be an hour delay before we respond" at times. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the prognosis is good. "There's a group of people who have a lot of 
pride in the neighborhood," Helton says, "families living there now that have 
been living there for some time," who stuck it out through the rough times. 
"Santa Anita has gone through some evolutionary change," and for the better.

REDONDO SURVIVES BIG SOUTH TORRANCE RALLY, HANGS ONTO 8-7 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Redondo High School's Frank Bignami used up six of his nine lives Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Then his teammates nearly used up the rest of theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Bignami pitched his way into and out of jams for the first six innings of 
Redondo's Ocean League opener against visiting South Torrance, but the 
right-hander finally ran out of luck in the seventh. South stormed Bignami and 
reliever Akash Sehgal for six runs in the inning, but Redondo held on for an 
8-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"South got their share of hits off Frank, but he made the great pitches when he 
had to," Redondo Coach Tim Ammentorp said. "He got some key strikeouts, and we 
played solid defense behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Redondo's 8-1 lead looked safe going into the seventh, but Bignami gave up a 
single and two walks to start the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Bignami came out for the soft-throwing Sehgal, who had an 0.66 earned-run 
average after four games. But South's Tay Sneddon and Stu Manthey greeted 
Sehgal with soft RBI singles. Then South third baseman Brian Swearingen cleared 
the bases with a triple up the right-field alley. 
</P>
<P>
Swearingen scored on Chris Castillon's sacrifice fly to left, but Sehgal got 
Kevin Fitzpatrick to fly to center to end the game and get the save. 
</P>
<P>
South had runners on base in every inning. But Bignami (2-1) escaped trouble in 
the first with a double play, and then retired three hitters in a row in the 
second after Sneddon doubled and went to third on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Bignami ended a threat in the third by striking out South's Greg Paluszek with 
runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up a walk and a double to start the fourth, but Redondo shortstop Brian 
Davison nailed Sneddon trying to score from third on a ground ball. Jason Bobb 
then flied to center, and Redondo center fielder Brett Tyrrell gunned Manthey 
down at the plate for a double play. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Bignami allowed two runners but got a pair of strikeouts to get 
out of the jam. South (2-6 overall, 0-1 in league) finally scratched out a run 
in the sixth on Bobb's bad-hop single. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Redondo (6-3, 1-0) needed each of its eight runs. The 
Seahawks broke a scoreless tie with a pair of runs in the fourth, then got six 
more in the fifth with the help of three South errors and Artie Scarpino's 
pinch two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo second baseman Chris Townsend and designated hitter Brian Fitzgerald 
led the Seahawks with two singles and a run apiece. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard 6, Bosco Tech 3 -- Junior right-hander Andy Diver improved his 
record to 4-0 by pitching a four-hitter, and Jeff Richardson and John Coleman 
each batted two for three to lead the Vikings to a Camino Real League victory 
at St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 3-2, in the second inning, Diver finished the game by 
retiring 17 batters in a row. Bosco Tech scored all its runs in the second on 
three bloop hits, a walk and a run-scoring ground out. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard (6-1 overall, 2-0 in league play) went ahead with two runs in the 
bottom of the second. Bob Waller led off with a double, went to third on a 
single by Brian Shackleford and scored on Coleman's squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
After Shackleford was picked off second, Coleman stole second and went to third 
on an errant throw. Sean Dunbar walked, and Coleman came home on a double 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who is batting .474 (nine for 19), homered and drove in two runs as 
St. Bernard kept pace with El Segundo for first place. Coleman stole three 
bases to give him 14 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bosco Tech slipped to 1-1 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo 18, St. Monica 0 -- Brett Newell batted four for four with a home 
run, a triple and four RBIs, Jason Wayt drove in three runs and right-hander 
Rob Croxall pitched a two-hitter to power the Eagles to another easy victory in 
a Camino Real League game at Marine Park in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo (7-1 overall, 2-0 in league play) has outscored its last three 
opponents, 77-7. 
</P>
<P>
Croxall (3-1) took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, when he surrendered two 
hits. The Eagles supported him with an errorless defensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
Newell, a junior third baseman, hit a two-run homer in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance 5, Mira Costa 4 -- The Warriors rallied from a 4-0 deficit and 
scored the winning run on Stefan Wilson's squeeze bunt in the sixth inning in 
an Ocean League opener at West. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a sophomore right-hander who pitched a four-hitter, drove in John Walsh 
with his bunt, which capped a three-run sixth for West (2-5 overall). 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa (1-8) scored all four runs in the second, highlighted by D. J. 
Allen's two-run single.

CAL POLY WOMEN TO HOST FINAL FOUR TOURNEY FOR FIRST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team will make its seventh appearance in 
the last nine seasons the NCAA Division II final four tournament starting 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But this appearance will be a little different from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
It will mark the first time that the Broncos will host the final four 
tournament. The semifinals will be Friday and the final and third-place game 
Saturday at Kellogg Gymnasium in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which enters the final four with a 28-3 record and the No. 2 ranking in 
Division II, will have a difficult assignment in their tournament opener at 8 
p.m. Friday. The Broncos must face top-ranked Delta State (30-1) of 
Mississippi, a team that defeated Pomona by a one-sided 88-58 score in the 
championship game last year in Cleveland, Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal game at 6 p.m. Friday, fifth-ranked Bentley (30-3) of 
Massachusetts will meet 14th-ranked Oakland (27-4) of Michigan. The winners 
play for the title at 8 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But first the Broncos must get past a Delta State squad that has exceptional 
size on its front line. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Statesmen, who have an all-time record of 15-3 in Division II 
tournament play, have four starters returning from last year's championship 
team including 6-0 seniors Crystal Hardy and Anita Robinson at forward and Pam 
Lockett at center. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy is averaging 15.5 points and 7.3 rebounds, Lockett 15.1 points and 8.8 
rebounds and Robinson 13 points and 7.1 rebounds. Another player from last 
year's title winner is senior guard Liz Wallace (5-7). 
</P>
<P>
While Delta State has an impressive track record in NCAA tournament play, 
Pomona's may be even more noteworthy. The Broncos have a 28-5 all-time record 
in postseason play and captured Division II titles in 1982, 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who defeated fourth-ranked North Dakota by a 67-64 score in the 
Division II quarterfinals last week to advance to the final four, have been led 
by the strong inside play of All-America 6-2 center Niki Bracken and 
All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 6-1 forward Marcine Edmonds. Bracken 
averages 19 points and 9.5 rebounds and Edmonds 13.6 points and 6.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The other starters for Pomona are juniors Kelly Connelly (6-1) at forward and 
Denise Ogburn (5-5) and Stephanie Coons (5-11) at guards. Coons, a former 
standout at Wilson High in Hacienda Heights, averages 9.9 points and 5.5 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has also received steady play from reserve center Danielle Carter, who 
averages 9.7 points and 6.8 rebounds. Reserve guard Serenda Valdez also played 
well in the quarterfinals last week with a career-high 23 points and a 
school-record seven three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the top track and field performers in the world will compete in the 
fifth annual Azusa Pacific University Meet of Champions on Saturday in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
Field events start at 9:30 a.m. and running events at 12:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best events could be the 300-meter run, which will include 
world-class sprinters Innocent Egbunike and Sunday Uti of Nigeria, Gabriel 
Tiacoh of the Ivory Coast and Darryl Robinson and Henry Thomas of the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Egbunike, a former Azusa Pacific star, has the fastest time by a non-American 
in the 400 meters at 44.17 seconds. Tiacoh was an Olympic silver medalist in 
the 400 in 1984, and Uti won an Olympic bronze medal on Nigeria's 400-meter 
relay team in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Another strong field has been assembled for the 300-meter hurdles including 
former UCLA star Kevin Young, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 400-meter 
hurdles last year with a best of 47.86 seconds. Also included are Amadou Dia Ba 
of Senegal, who won a silver medal in the 400 hurdles in the 1988 Summer 
Olympics, George Porter of USC and Nate Page of the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The high jump has a pair of outstanding competitors in Doug Nordquist, former 
American record holder, and Lee Balkin, a former NCAA champion from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The sprints will be well-represented with world-class long jumper Larry Myricks 
of the U.S. competing in the 100- and 200-meter runs and Grace Jackson of 
Jamaica, who won the silver medal in the women's 200 meters at the 1988 Summer 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Among former Azusa Pacific standouts competing will be Dave Johnson, who holds 
the American record in the modern decathlon, and Mike Barnett, ranked No. 1 in 
the U.S. in the javelin in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars will also be represented by senior Ade Olukoju, a native of 
Nigeria, one of the top-ranked discus throwers in the world, and Latrese 
Johnson, a sophomore who is two-time National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics Champion in the women's high jump. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Karnoski of Glendora High School and Jim Walker of Temple City, two of the 
most successful coaches in the San Gabriel Valley last season, have been named 
coaches for the 11th annual Hall of Fame All-Star Football Game to be held July 
20 at Citrus College in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
Karnoski guided Glendora to a co-championship in CIF Division IV last season. 
The Tartans tied Ramona, 28-28, in the title game to finish with the season 
with a 12-1-1 record -- best in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Karnoski has a winning career record of 30-23-1 at Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
Walker also directed Temple City to an outstanding season as the Rams reached 
the CIF Division VII semifinals for the second year in a row before losing to 
Lompoc by a 48-38 score. The Rams finished with a 9-4 record after posting a 
10-2-1 mark the previous year.

SCHOOL WRITING TESTS CHEER EDUCATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If one of the goals of regular testing is to help shape what goes on in the 
classroom, then state and local education officials have reason to be cheered 
by results of a statewide survey that looks at the newly revised California 
Assessment Program's writing exam. 
</P>
<P>
"To show continued success on the CAP writing test, schools must develop a 
multi-year approach to writing instruction that crosses all grade levels and 
subject areas," state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said when the test 
results were made public in February. And that is apparently what is happening. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide survey by two college professors showed that the writing exam is 
having an effect on the English curriculum in junior high and middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
Professors Sandra Murphy of San Francisco State University and Charles Cooper 
of UC San Diego sent their survey to eighth-grade teachers at 600 randomly 
selected schools, and more than 90% of English teachers responding said the 
test will strengthen the curriculum at their schools. 
</P>
<P>
The annual test, administered to 308,000 eighth-graders last spring, covers 
eight types of writing. All essays must be completed in 45 minutes, and each is 
scored to measure thinking and writing process skills as well as such mechanics 
of writing as spelling and grammar. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the survey respondents also said they have already changed the 
way they teach writing because of the test, and 78% said they now make more 
writing assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Four types of writing -- autobiographical incident, evaluation, problem 
solution and report of information -- were introduced when the writing 
assessment program was launched in 1987. First-hand biography and story were 
added in 1988, followed last year by the addition of observational writing and 
speculation about causes or effects. 
</P>
<P>
A writing exam for 12th-graders was begun in the fall of 1988 and will be fully 
implemented with eight tests this November. State officials are considering 
whether to add writing tests for sixth-graders and possibly even for 
third-graders. 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
Here are the school-by-school results of the California Assessment Program's 
writing exam that was administered to eighth-graders throughout the state last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
The exam consists of eight tests of writing ability and represents the state's 
biggest step to date away from the much-criticized multiple-choice method of 
testing academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Results are listed by school district and by individual school so that parents 
can compare the performance of youngsters in their community with that of 
students in the rest of Los Angeles County and throughout California. (Schools 
are listed alphabetically by district.) 
</P>
<P>
Because the exam was changed substantially last year with the addition of two 
more writing tests, only the latest round of scores is listed. 
</P>
<P>
The scaled score is a combination of results on each of the eight separate 
writing tests. The statewide average score was 255 for eighth-graders, and the 
average in Los Angeles County was 230. 
</P>
<P>
State rank shows the school or district's rank (on a scale of 1 to 99), 
comparing its scores to scores of every other school or district in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Relative rank is a way to compare a district or school with another that is 
similar to it in terms of student ethnic and socioeconomic makeup and students' 
ability to speak English fluently, as well as how often those students move 
from school to school. The value listed is the school's percentile rank within 
its comparison group.

NEW SALT COD IS CONVENIENT FOR COOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS, Michael Roberts is chef at Trumps in Los Angeles and author 
of Secret Ingredients, Bantam, $19.95.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cod is a common and relatively inexpensive fish which, in its fresh state, is 
good mostly for preparing fish sticks (the crusty breading at least gives it 
texture). But a little-known (at least to American tables) method of preserving 
cod turns this lowly ocean denizen into an uncommonly delicious commodity. It's 
one of the important raw ingredients of Mediterranean cooking -- called bacalao 
in Spain, bacala in Italy, bacalhau in Portugal, morue in France. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional way of salting, then air-drying the cod to a stiff cardboard 
appearance may not seem appetizing to the uninitiated and its aroma is 
unmistakable, too. But the flavor is incomparable. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, I've seen a new salt cod, nice thick fillets of fish 
that have been salted but only partly dried. They are packed in pretty wooden 
boxes and are often sold in the refrigerator case of supermarkets. What they 
lack in soul, they gain in convenience, since there are no bones to pick, no 
skin to peel off. 
</P>
<P>
Salt cod must be soaked in water for two or three days before using. The 
resulting fish is creamy, with delicious fresh-tasting flavor -- sweet, not 
even salty. The texture of this revived cod enables it to absorb oil, and in 
France it is often pounded into a truly fabulous concoction called Brandade. 
</P>
<P>
There is some debate about what an authentic Brandade is. In Nimes, it is 
simply boiled salt cod pounded together with hot olive oil and milk. On the 
other side of the Rhone river, in Provence, they add garlic. Farther west, in 
Carcassonne, they add potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Because many Americans are unfamiliar with salt cod and may have trouble 
finding it, I have adapted an easy Brandade recipe to use other fish. The more 
"fishy" fish taste better in this recipe than the milder ones. Use cooked 
bluefish, carp, pompano, mackerel or salmon -- it's a great way to use 
leftovers and, in fact, combines well with leftover mashed potatoes. Or use a 
smoked fish -- salmon, trout, eel, sturgeon or finnan haddie. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to give an exact olive oil measurement in this recipe because 
the amount you add will depend on the other ingredients that you use. Leftover 
mashed potatoes and cooked unsalted fish will require less olive oil than the 
pulp of a baked potato combined with salted or smoked fish. The important thing 
to know is that all the ingredients must be hot before mashing them together 
into Brandade. 
</P>
<P>
Use Brandade for chiles rellenos or stuffed cabbage. Or roll it into little 
balls and fry into croquettes to have with drinks before dinner. Served on its 
own it is a salty beginning to a meal that gets the juices flowing. But I 
prefer it as the main event served with crusty bread and accompanied by a 
simple green salad, making a wonderfully satisfying meal. The first time I 
tried Brandade, it reminded me of mashing mashed potatoes and meat loaf 
together when I was a child, but I liked it much better. 
</P>
<P>
BRANDADE DE MORUE 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds salt cod, smoked fish or other raw or cooked fish 
</P>
<P>
1 potato, about 1/2 pound 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons finely minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
1/2 to 3/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Toast 
</P>
<P>
If using salt cod, two or three days before preparing Brandade place fish in 
bowl, cover with water and refrigerate. Change water two or three times. The 
second day, drain salt cod. If using other fish, omit this step. 
</P>
<P>
Wash potato and bake at 375 degrees 45 minutes or until potato is soft. Cut 
potato in half, scoop pulp into mixing bowl and discard (or eat) skin. If using 
cooked potato from refrigerator or freezer, place in small baking dish, cover 
and heat at 350 degrees until warmed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, place cod or uncooked fish in medium pan, cover with fresh cold 
water and bring to boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and let stand 10 
minutes. Drain fish. If using smoked fish, omit this step. Remove and discard 
any skin and bones. If using cooked fresh or smoked fish from refrigerator or 
freezer, place it in small oven-proof dish, cover and heat at 350 degrees until 
hot. 
</P>
<P>
Add cooked fish to mixing bowl and mash along with potato. A large wooden 
pestle works best. Or combine potatoes and fish in mixer fitted with paddle and 
mix until fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
Combine garlic and oil in small saucepan and cook over medium heat until oil 
begins to bubble around garlic, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Slowly pour 
garlic oil into fish and potato mixture, mixing vigorously until incorporated. 
Mixture should be fluffy and shiny. Mound mixture on serving platter and 
surround with toast. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
BROCCOLI AND TOASTED PINE NUT SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1 pound broccoli 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon or 1 teaspoon dried 
</P>
<P>
Using small knife, cut broccoli into florets and set aside on plate. Fill 
2-quart pan with water, add salt and bring to boil over high heat. Fill large 
mixing bowl with water and ice cubes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, using knife or vegetable peeler, trim woody outer skin from broccoli 
stalks, exposing light green, tender core. Stalks should look somewhat like 
squared-off logs. Slice stalks into 1/8-inch slices, tip to stem. Stack a few 
slices and cut them lengthwise as finely as you can. You now have shapes like 
match sticks called "julienne." 
</P>
<P>
Submerge broccoli florets in rapidly boiling salted water and cook 1 1/2 
minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and plunge into ice water to stop cooking 
process and to retain bright green color. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat procedure with julienned stalks, cooking only 30 seconds. Remove from 
water and plunge into ice water. When completely chilled, remove all broccoli 
from ice bath and drain well on kitchen towels (wet broccoli will dilute 
dressing and ruin all your good work). 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in small skillet over medium heat. Add pine nuts and cook, 
tossing, until a light honey color. Sprinkle nuts and oil over broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
Just before serving, add vinegar and tarragon and toss gently. Mound on plates 
and serve. Makes 4 servings.

FILLMORE'S NAVEL ORANGES SWEET ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few things are more refreshing than a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. 
Most people mistakenly assume that Valencia oranges, not in season until May, 
are the only kind of oranges that can be juiced, often neglecting the very 
sweet and delicious navels currently in season, said Jan Finfrock, who grows 
navel oranges at Sespe Creek in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
"They are falling off the trees, they're so sweet," she said. People usually 
assume that the navel orange is only for eating because it's seedless and 
larger than the Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
According to Finfrock, the navel is so sweet that many people grate the orange 
peels and use them for cakes and icing. She also recommends using the juice for 
marinades for all kinds of meat and fish dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The best time to eat the oranges depends on where they are grown and how cold 
it is, said Pam Warren of Big Oak Ranch in Fillmore. This is the best time of 
year to stock up on navel oranges grown in the Fillmore area, she said, where 
the weather has been warmer. 
</P>
<P>
Navel oranges can also make excellent room deodorizers, Warren said. She uses 
them to make potpourri balls that last several weeks by taking a fresh navel 
orange, poking a hole in the skin, putting a clove in it, rolling it in 
cinnamon and letting it sit out for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Other local citrus fruits that are looking particularly good this week are 
tangerines, according to Tony Thatcher, manager of Friend's Ranch in Ojai. "The 
season here is longer than most areas. The weather's better here in Ojai than 
on the coast, for tangerines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Area food enthusiasts looking for something different and exotic that's grown 
locally should try bananas, said Paul Turner, co-owner of Seaside Banana 
Gardens in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladyfingers" which originated from southern India, and are grown at the 
Ventura farm, taste like raspberries, according to Turner. 
</P>
<P>
And gourmets who favor imported foods should try the fresh Medjool dates that 
have just come in from the Bard Valley in Yuma, said Nancy Krast, assistant 
manager at Trader Joe's in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
From the Washington coast this week are mini-salmon that are mild, delicate, 
boneless and easy to cook, said Bob Nazarian of Gelson's in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Local seafood this week can be found at Brandon King Seafood in Oxnard, where 
they buy live and spot prawns that are caught near Port Hueneme, said general 
manager Hipolito Marin. 
</P>

HAUNTING 1-WOMAN SHOW LOOKS TO EASTERN MYTHOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interested in Japanese and Chinese mythology? How about contemporary dance and 
music? Ghost stories? Brenda Wong Aoki fuses these elements into her solo 
storytelling performance Saturday at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Obake" is Aoki's own creation, a collection of four ghost stories influenced 
by Japanese Noh and Kyogen theater techniques and injected with a modern 
feminist sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
Props are used sparsely. The kimono-clad Aoki conveys her interpretations 
through an expressive voice and body movement that punctuates the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
The stories include such common Eastern mythological images as immortal 
monkeys, ghostly lovers and demon quellers. One story is an amusing tale of the 
mischievous Monkey King, drawn from a series of Chinese tales, recounting how 
he manages to thwart the combined will of heaven and hell. 
</P>
<P>
SHOW TIMES 
</P>
<P>
The performance will take place 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Ventura High School's 
Little Theater, 2155 E. Main St., Ventura. Tickets: $7, $5 Ventura Arts Council 
member, $2 children, and they are available at Momentum Gallery, 34 N. Palm 
St., Ventura. The performance is a benefit for Ventura Arts Council's 
Artists-in-the-Classroom program. Call 653-0828 for more information.

NEST OF OJAI'S ITALIAN CUISINE MIXES ELEGANCE AND EARTHINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning, the Nest of Ojai was exactly what you'd expect from the name: 
a cozy little sandwich shop across the street from the Ojai Museum. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of passing through several owners, it has evolved into the very 
epitome of Ojai-style coziness. There's a skylight in the corrugated roof and 
lots of tasteful woodwork against the light-colored walls, particularly in the 
bar. The sound track is soothing, static New Age music exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
The Nest still has some sandwiches at lunchtime, but the menu has become much 
more ambitious. The current chef is Aldo Saad, formerly chef at a number of Los 
Angeles and Beverly Hills restaurants, and he specializes in Northern Italian 
food, though with tendencies toward both elegant nouvelle cuisine and earthy 
peasant cooking. And here and there, as if in a gesture of coziness, he 
includes dishes that might be American, if we could be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
On the elegant side is the ultra-modern array of vegetables that accompanies 
most entrees: baby carrots, baby white carrots, squash blossoms, terrifically 
fresh green beans, pale-fried chunks of potato the size of marbles, a lozenge 
of puffy corn polenta. The entree might be something like ahi tuna in a pool of 
sharp lime butter sauce with a little star pattern of kiwi puree painted on it, 
or very tender Santa Barbara abalone with shiitake mushrooms and butter. 
</P>
<P>
On the earthy side is pappardelle con anatra: a plate piled high with broad 
noodles, chunks of duck, thick duck gravy, spinach and lentils. This is a 
heavy, meaty dish, though the effect is lightened a little by a couple of 
radicchio leaves scattered around like red-purple arrows pointing out of the 
brown and green hill of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
The sandwiches at lunch are American, of course. Oddly, at dinner the veal in 
brown butter sauce seems American too, a sort of veal cutlet with excellent 
crunchy breading. It is topped with what is, in effect, a tomato and exotic 
lettuce salad, as if the nation's most elegant truck stop served its salads on 
top of the entrees. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, we have orthodox Northern Italian food: say, fettuccine in 
cream sauce with peas and strong, salty ham, or lobster ravioli in butter 
(well, there's a little French-style tarragon in there too). Of course, there's 
a thoroughly Spanish paella lurking around, the rice mixed with fish, clams, 
mussels and cumin-heavy homemade sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, when the Nest serves osso buco, it's not as orthodox as it 
might be. Instead of the usual creamy risotto, the veal shank comes with a mold 
of saffron rice spotted with peas and bits of sweet pepper. The shank is served 
whole, too, rather than cut into segments. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list is rather short, but it includes a rugged bresaola salad 
full of chunks of artichoke heart and lots of shaved Parmesan, as well as 
slivers of dried beef among the lettuces. The only weakness among the 
appetizers is the eggplant. The thin slices folded with tomato sauce and melted 
cheese seem too simple and unassuming for an appetizer, as if they belonged 
among the side dishes along with the baby vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
There's a model of a creme brulee at dessert time, creamy and with a real burnt 
caramel flavor in the crust. The Nest also makes its own gelati (best: white 
pistachio). When the Nest makes tirami su, the ladyfingers are mixed not only 
with mascarpone cheese and cream but, as the menu boasts, Bailey's Irish Cream. 
Fittingly, it's a downright cozy variation. 
</P>

NEIGHBORHOOD LOUNGE IS BASKING IN LIMELIGHT OF THEATRE'S SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some purveyors of night life on the Central Coast may resent the Ventura 
Theatre's success, but not Ellis Otwell, the 56-year-old owner of the San Souci 
Cocktail Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
The dark, tiny, working-class bar with a capacity of 30 people, across Chestnut 
Street from the theater, has become something of a hangout for concert-goers, 
especially among the fishnet-stockings-and-leather-jacket set. 
</P>
<P>
The theater's reopening nearly two years ago "really upped our business," 
Otwell said. He estimated that sales have increased by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"They come in before a concert, after a concert and go back and forth for a 
break," said Marjory Wardien, the bar's manager. She owns another Ventura 
lounge, the Town and Country. 
</P>
<P>
The influx has changed the complexion of the lounge. Regulars, who have come to 
the bar for years and tend toward cowboy hats and stretch pants, have made room 
for fans of rock bands such as Fishbone and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
Otwell, a former supplier of tools to the oil industry, believes his success is 
due to his prices, which run $2 for a mixed drink -- albeit, one of the well 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Ignacio, a 35-year-old Oxnard engineer who dropped into the bar before 
John Prine's recent concert, said location is the key. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like a logical place to catch a buzz before going over to the 
show," said Ignacio, in a big-shouldered, black overcoat and spiky haircut. 
</P>
<P>
Other concert-goers spoke lovingly of the bar's decor, which Otwell describes 
as "Old English" and swears hasn't changed in the 30 years since the San Souci 
-- that's French for "without a care" -- opened. 
</P>
<P>
Dominated by a large U-shaped Formica bar equipped with a bell for those 
occasions when a regular buys the house a round, it's sort of a sea of red, 
with red Naugahyde booths illuminated by red light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
A clock with a picture of John Wayne decoupaged to its face hangs on the wall. 
A jukebox and dart board share the other room with a couple of photographs of 
Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a big black box hanging from the ceiling that sucks cigarette smoke, 
the bar smells of soggy bar towels and heaping ashtrays. The only natural light 
that leaks into the windowless, two-room establishment comes from the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," says one local reviewer. "It's like this out-of-the-way cowboy 
dive." 
</P>
<P>
But where some see a set for a Guess Jeans advertisement, others have found a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Reynolds, a retired sewing machine salesman, said he's been coming into the 
bar on a daily basis since Otwell bought it 14 years ago. Before that, he 
frequented the Pump Room, the Main Street bar that Otwell sold to buy the San 
Souci. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I just come in for a cup of coffee, but I'm always here," he said. 
"This is a comfortable place. I know just about everybody here." 
</P>
<P>
And presiding over it all is Otwell, who keeps the bar open 365 days a year and 
closes for a scant four hours daily, between 2 and 6 a.m. He serves 
Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner there, and once a month dons an apron for a 
free barbecue in a small courtyard in front of the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
These are the touches of an old bar hand. Over the years, Otwell has owned a 
restaurant and three bars, including Ventura Avenue's Derek Room, which he sold 
six months ago. The former oil man didn't hit pay dirt, however, until the 
Ventura Theater reopened across from the San Souci. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day," he said, "people ask to buy it."

VENTURA THEATRE CREDITED WITH BOOSTING MUSIC SCENE AND ACCUSED OF WOOING ACTS 
FROM OTHER CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ticket-holders at the Ventura Theatre's recent concert by Clarence Clemons 
couldn't believe their luck when the former saxophone player for Bruce 
Springsteen made room on stage for The Boss himself. 
</P>
<P>
After the impromptu serenade by the performer whose last Southern California 
concert sold out the Los Angeles Sports Arena for four days, they watched in 
awe as Jackson Browne and frequent companion Daryl Hannah jumped into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a treat like they've never had before," said the nightclub's owner, 
Gary Folgner. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no single event better illustrates how far the local music scene has 
come since Folgner, a veteran concert promoter from Orange County, opened the 
62-year-old movie place in 1988 to a caliber of acts that Ventura County 
residents once found only in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, after all, was the community that two years ago turned a cold shoulder 
to the Grateful Dead over complaints of rowdy behavior on the part of fans at a 
previous concert. 
</P>
<P>
And this was the 12,000-square-foot pre-Depression gem where a group of local 
businessmen had failed four years ago to establish a nightclub. Now, after 
nearly two years of losses routine in launching a business, Folgner said he has 
begun to break even at the 850-seat venue and expects to begin turning a profit 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
The club owner even has plans, he said, to add three more clubs -- in 
Sacramento, Riverside and Tempe, Ariz. -- to his portfolio, which includes the 
Coach House, a nightclub in San Juan Capistrano. As an additional measure of 
the theater's strength, its management has persuaded the city to triple the 
size of Ventura's annual fall music festival, move it from Arroyo Verde Park 
and place it in the theater's downtown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We've pioneered a lot at the Ventura Theatre," said Folgner, "and we're going 
to continue to be pioneers." 
</P>
<P>
This news is music to the ears of many concert-goers, who applaud the theater's 
mix of up-and-coming acts, big-name underground bands and established 
performers with more loyal fans than recent hits. Ventura city officials and 
business leaders are also pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides a real variety of entertainment, and that's beneficial . . . for 
all the cultural reasons and what economists call the ripple effect," said 
Ventura Mayor Richard Francis. Theater-goers also "go out to dinner and bars 
here and enjoy the rest of the community once they're here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some local bands, music critics and other concert promoters aren't as 
enthusiastic. They paint an unflattering picture of a place where band members 
say they are pressured to sell tickets and bouncers are accused of being overly 
aggressive. And Ventura Theatre, it is alleged, has wooed name acts from 
Central Coast nightclubs after promoters spent time and money developing an 
audience for them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the boss, and they don't let you forget it," said a band member who 
asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. "They're really arrogant to 
deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Folgner, whose acts range from jazz to salsa to rock to country, dismissed the 
complaints as "professional envy and maybe not understanding the business." 
Concert promoters, who say that the Ventura Theatre has wreaked havoc with the 
club scene along the Central Coast, counter that Folgner knows only too well 
that they understand the business. 
</P>
<P>
"We put in all the brain work and the savvy and they reap the rewards," said 
Loanne Wullaert, an Isla Vista record store owner who has brought acts to the 
UC Santa Barbara watering hole, The Graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Wullaert says she has watched a string of acts including Fishbone, the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers and the Neville Brothers go to the Ventura Theatre after she 
introduced them to local audiences. 
</P>
<P>
She maintains that the turn of events violated "an unwritten rule called 'the 
first right of refusal.' " 
</P>
<P>
"If you've booked an act before in a market, you're supposed to get it the next 
time," she said. "That way, if you've lost money on it the first time, you get 
to make it up." 
</P>
<P>
While he bristled at the suggestion that he's riding on anybody's coattails, 
Folgner insisted there's nothing wrong with wooing acts away from the clubs 
with the promise of bigger audiences and higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you had Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen when they were starting 
out doesn't mean they're going to come back to your club when they're in town," 
he said. "Acts grow out of clubs. They move into theaters, then go to sheds and 
then arenas." Signs of a lopsided battle among music showcases along the 
Central Coast nonetheless abound. The list of casualties includes: 
</P>
<P>
* Ventura's Holiday Inn Beach Resort. The number of concerts offered in the 
inn's Top of the Harbor restaurant has dropped from 50 in 1987 to 20 last year 
because of competition from the Ventura Theatre in combination with company 
policies that restrict days and months when acts can play, said Greg Bennett, 
the inn's general manager during the 3-year-old "Classic Concerts Series." 
Plans next year, he said, call for only six acts. 
</P>
<P>
* At least one pair of independent promoters in Santa Barbara County, Wullaert 
and her husband, Robert, claim they have stopped booking acts because they 
can't compete with the theater. Stephen Cloud, an 18-year veteran of concert 
promoting in Santa Barbara, said competition from the theater was one of many 
reasons he has stopped booking acts at the 664-seat Lobero Theatrer and the 
2000-seat Arlington Theater. "It's eliminated the scene here," Cloud said. 
</P>
<P>
Some competitors have taken steps to protect their turf. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Holiday Inn has switched from rock and jazz to country music, said 
Bennett, the former manager. However, the approach has lost some of its punch 
because the Ventura Theatre shortly afterward began offering some of the same 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
Carnaval, a 350-seat dance club in Santa Barbara, has retaliated by shunning 
established artists in favor of rising stars. 
</P>
<P>
"They can have the dinosaurs," said club Manager Bill Hardie. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Theatre also has its share of detractors among local band members, who 
complain of being pressured to sell advance tickets to concerts under an 
arrangement that allows them to pocket a $2 profit on each ticket instead of 
getting paid. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never said, 'If you don't do this you won't be asked back,' but you kind 
of assume it's that way, said Frank Barajas, the lead singer of Durango 95, a 
Ventura-based folk rock group. 
</P>
<P>
Because they sometimes find it difficult to sell tickets, band members will 
forgo their cut to sell the tickets at a cheaper price, he said. "It's like 
paying to play." 
</P>
<P>
But as Raging Arb has found, even selling tickets to a concert is no assurance 
that a local performer will appear. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sold 150 to 200 tickets and then they called to say they've changed 
their minds about playing," said Ross Emery, a member of the Ventura 
country-blues band, of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Folgner said he didn't remember the incident, but said if it happened, it was 
the decision of the name act playing and not the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have the pressure of the act that's playing there to have someone 
they've been playing with," Folgner said. 
</P>
<P>
Folgner said he does pay local bands -- $100 a concert -- and defended the 
ticket-selling practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the opportunity for them to make more money," he said, noting that 
the approach is used by some Los Angeles clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are complaints about the theater's bouncers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them use chokeholds," Wullaert said. "I've seen five men descend on 
a woman. They've grabbed people by the hair to get them off the stage." 
</P>
<P>
So allegedly hard-handed is the theater's approach that Christina Zafiris, an 
rock radio show host at UC Santa Barbara radio station KCSB, said she no longer 
promotes its shows on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"They use Nazi-type tactics," said Beth Allen, a music critic for the Santa 
Barbara Independent, a weekly entertainment tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
Folgner said he doubts that the violent incidents occurred but said his 
bouncers routinely remove fans who try to go on stage or engage in 
slam-dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"You're making entertainment," he 
</P>
<P>
said. "You have to make sure people don't get hurt. They come to see concerts 
-- not gang wars." 
</P>
<P>
He said he learned that lesson the hard way. The Ventura Police Department had 
to be called in to quell a disturbance that broke out between rival gangs 
during a performance by Social Distortion, a punk band that was one of the 
first acts to play the theater. If the latest incarnation of the Ventura 
Theatre has become the new bully on the block, it started out as an 98-pound 
weakling. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1928 for vaudeville acts, the ornate theater had gone through two 
revival attempts before Folgner signed a 10-year lease and completed $250,000 
in renovations. 
</P>
<P>
Folgner also had his spate of bad luck. He said he lost $300,000 in the first 
year and $250,000 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not where we should be," he said. "We're just barely breaking even. I 
think next year we'll start to make up for the losses." 
</P>
<P>
What has made the latest version of the theater succeed, it turns out, is also 
what has made it a nearly invincible opponent in bidding wars. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is part of a booking network that includes not just the 400-seat 
Coach House but also The Strand in Redondo Beach, Calamity Jane's in Las Vegas 
and Bogart's in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, you can say, 'If you give me one day, I'll give you four others,' " 
Folgner said. Folgner's plans to open three new clubs in California and Arizona 
would presumably enhance the theater's ability to attract talent. Folgner also 
points out that he doesn't have to battle some of the same weaknesses as his 
brethren in the Santa Barbara market, which has a potential audience of only 
300,000 within a 30-mile radius. Ventura has 750,000 people within the same 
number of miles. It stretches from Santa Barbara to Thousand Oaks. If Folgner 
has profited at the expense of the music scene elsewhere, he appears to have 
spread the wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Peter Weal, owner of Wild Planet, a Main Street record store located 
less than a block from the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a good show, I'll stay open late and make an extra $100 to $200," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another benefactor has been the San Souci Cocktail Lounge, a cowboy bar located 
across Chestnut Street from the theater (see related story below). 
</P>
<P>
Even the Holiday Inn has profited, Bennett said. Many of the bands stay there 
after playing the theater and concert-goers frequently drop by for dinner or 
even spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's healthy to have someone like the Ventura Theatre in town," he said.

UNOCAL MUSEUM IS A CELEBRATION OF OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1890s red brick building with its beige awnings and green cast-iron columns 
looks as if it has been transplanted from Disneyland's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
The quaint, two-story building has played a prominent part in Santa Paula 
history, as well as doubling as a tourist attraction for decades. Now, two 
years after its closure in 1988, the Unocal Museum is open for business again. 
</P>
<P>
The museum on East Main Street was where Union Oil Company (now known as Unocal 
Corporation) was founded nearly a century ago. The company headquarters were 
moved to Los Angeles in 1901, but division offices were kept at the Santa Paula 
location until 1988, said Karen Sikkema, a Unocal vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The first floor of the building has housed museum exhibits since 1950, but the 
second floor was reserved for offices, Sikkema said. About $2.5 million was 
spent updating the first floor exhibits and converting the second floor into 
turn-of-the-century style offices. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from a preview of the museum before its March 25 opening, the money was 
well-spent. An old-fashioned time clock is the first thing that greets visitors 
when they come through the door. Visitors may punch in and keep a card as a 
souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
The self-explanatory exhibits and videos allow tourists to roam freely on the 
first floor. The museum exhibits are an unabashed celebration of oil and the 
oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
For children, there's the crude-oil pinball machine, and for history buffs, 
there are old photographs and 1890s film footage that accompany the Unocal time 
line. 
</P>
<P>
For model builders, there are miniature versions of a drill ship, a jack-up 
brig and off-shore oil stations. 
</P>
<P>
For movie fans, there is a little-known Unocal commercial featuring Marilyn 
Monroe. And there are exhibits showing how oil is created, how geologists find 
it and how it is transported. 
</P>
<P>
Those who think wistfully of the good old days when gasoline was 9 cents a 
gallon can relive them by viewing an old-fashioned pumper and cash register. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors who wish to see the old-fashioned offices upstairs should make 
appointments first, said museum curator Carol Schwindt. Tour guides, many of 
whom are retired Unocal employees, will lead groups through the restored 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
The second floor features an apartment from the 1930s, when the superintendent 
of the operation lived at the office. The brass bed, old-fashioned stove and 
kerosene lamps are right out of an episode of the Waltons. 
</P>
<P>
Other offices feature the original desk of Unocal's first geologist, plus his 
old maps and files. A family photograph sits on his desk, along with an 
old-fashioned pencil sharpener. 
</P>
<P>
The board room, which offers a view of 10th Street and Main Street, actually 
doesn't look much different from today's version, with the possible exception 
of brass lights and kerosene lamps. 
</P>
<P>
In an adjoining building, in front of a park, is an old cable-tool drill rig 
that is over 100 hundred years old. 
</P>
<P>
And, naturally, adjoining the museum is a Unocal gas station. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes to two hours could be spent at the Unocal Museum. 
</P>
<P>
* UNOCAL MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
The museum is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. Call 
805-933-0076 for more information.

VERDICTS ON EXXON SKIPPER;

NOT GUILTY ON 3 MAJOR CHARGES

<P>
Joseph Hazelwood today was acquitted of three major charges and convicted of 
one misdemeanor, negligent discharge of oil today, two days before the first 
anniversary of the nation's worst oil spill created by his tanker, the Exxon 
Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
The single charge on which Hazelwood was convicted carries a maximum sentence 
of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine -- far less than the 70 years and $61,000 
fine he could have faced. 
</P>
<P>
There were bursts of applause in the court room as Superior Court Judge Karl 
Johnstone read the first three verdicts of "not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's lawyers patted him on the back, and for the first time in the long 
trial, the normally solemn defendant smiled broadly. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors absolved Hazelwood of all charges alleging that he was drunk and 
reckless when the tanker ran aground, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
into Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The six-man, six-woman jury pondered Hazelwood's fate from 8:30 a.m. until 5 
p.m. Wednesday and reached their decision after noon today. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an alternate juror, relieved of her duty as well as her court-imposed 
silence when the 12 regular jurors got the case, told reporters that the 
prosecution failed to prove its case and that she would acquit Hazelwood. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way I feel. I hope other jurors feel that way," said Terry Turner, 
30, a bookkeeper, who listened to all the testimony about the March 24, 1989, 
wreck of the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Captain Hazelwood thought it was going to be a normal transit," she 
said of trip that began routinely and ended up causing an 11-million-gallon oil 
spill, America's worst. 
</P>
<P>
Turner rejected prosecution arguments that Hazelwood was drunk, saying, "They 
really don't have any evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The defense said the third mate and the helmsman failed to execute turn orders 
-- based on instructions from Hazelwood to return to tanker lanes after a 
detour around icebergs -- and that the Coast Guard radar watchstander should 
have seen the tanker headed for disaster and warned it. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood had left the bridge of the ship about 15 minutes before the 
grounding. 
</P>
<P>
But Instruction No. 29, of the 49 instructions taking up 51 pages that the 
judge gave jurors, states, "It is not necessary for the defendant's actions or 
inactions in this case to be the sole proximate cause for the risks that were 
created in this case. 
</P>
<P>
"Where a defendant recklessly creates a risk, the fact that other persons' acts 
also contributed to the creation of the risk does not serve to exculpate the 
defendant. It is only necessary that the defendant's actions be a cause of the 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, even if others share blame for the wreck, Hazelwood could still 
have been found guilty if his conduct was judged reckless and played a part in 
the wreck and spill. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., was the only individual charged with crimes 
arising out of the spill, but the Exxon Corp. and Exxon Shipping Co. were 
charged in a five-count federal indictment last month and 150 civil suits have 
been filed against Exxon, many of them also naming Hazelwood.

COLLISION FATAL TO IRVINE MAN, 20

<P>
A 20-year-old Irvine man died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana after his 
motorcycle collided with a pickup truck, police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Thomas Snell died from head injuries and his pillion rider, 18-year-old 
Edward S. Rogewski Jr., also of Irvine, sustained moderate injuries and was 
listed in satisfactory condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, 
said Irvine police senior officer Owen Kreza. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 7:50 p.m. Wednesday as the two men were headed east 
on Walnut Avenue in Irvine. Kreza said the motorcycle collided with the truck 
that was making a left turn onto Walnut Avenue from a side street. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics treated the two men at the scene before taking them to hospitals. 
Neither Snell nor Rogewski wore helmets, Kreza said. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-driver of the pickup, an Irvine resident, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
No citations were issued and the investigation was continuing, Kreza said.

Czechoslovakia's president said today his country's former rulers sold Libya 
1,000 tons of a virtually undetectable explosive, enough to supply the world's 
terrorists for 150 years. 
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Havel, on the second day of a state visit to Britain, told a news 
conference that Czechoslovakia was unable to force Libya to return the Semtex, 
a high explosive ideal for bomb makers since it cannot be detected by sniffer 
dogs or X-ray machines. 
</P>
<P>
Security experts believe that Semtex was used in a number of attacks, including 
the bombing of a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December, 1988, 
that killed all 259 people aboard the airliner and 11 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who died were Americans on their way home for the Christmas 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"We have ceased exporting this explosive some time ago but the past regime 
exported 1,000 tons to Libya. Two hundred grams (7 ounces) are enough to blow 
up an aircraft so world terrorism has supplies of Semtex to last 150 years," 
Havel said. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said the Communists had in the past sold Semtex for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The absurd side of the matter is that Czechoslovakia did not even make money 
on it. It was something which was not done for money. It was done on political 
orders which came from above to sell Semtex abroad," Havel said. He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Havel stopped short of saying that Czechoslovakia would no longer manufacture 
Semtex, but defended its production for peaceful use. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an industrial explosive necessary for various industrial purposes," he 
said. "It is not an explosive made especially for terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Some countries have similar explosives to Semtex that had been used in 
terrorist actions for which Czechoslovakia was blamed, Havel said. "Often it is 
difficult to tell whether the explosive was Semtex or some similar sort 
manufactured elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say traces of a chemical constituent of Semtex were found in the 
wreckage of a French DC-10 that blew up over the Sahara last year, killing 170 
people.

Japan sent 491 Chinese nationals, some in tears, back to China by boat today in 
the largest deportation of Chinese refugees who streamed into Japan during last 
year's political unrest in China. 
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding is they came here for economic related purposes," said Taizo 
Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been living in China and were not under political suppression." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, 450 men and 41 women who had been kept in detention centers since 
their arrival in Japan, were loaded onto a chartered Chinese ship at the port 
of Nagasaki by 220 police and several immigration authorities. Protesters 
demonstrated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has refrained from harshly criticizing China following the crackdown on 
pro-democracy demonstrators last June and has refused to give refugee status to 
the 1,763 mostly Chinese boat people who arrived in Japan last May.

U.S. CITES 'MAJOR' HEALTH ISSUE, EXPANDS RECALL OF L-TRYPTOPHAN

The federal government said today the dietary supplement L-tryptophan poses a 
"major public health problem" and expanded its recall because of indications 
that even small doses can cause a sometimes fatal blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confronted with a major public health problem," warned Health and Human 
Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, in the FDA's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge everyone to stop taking these supplements immediately." 
</P>
<P>
L-tryptophan, which is sold over the counter and used by some for insomnia, 
depression, premenstrual syndrome and appetite control, has been linked to a 
blood disorder called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS. Reports of the 
disorder have climbed to 1,411, with 19 deaths, the FDA said. Cases have been 
reported in every state. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA initially recalled only the larger dose forms of the product, those 
that would result in daily intake of 100 milligrams or more a day. 
</P>
<P>
However, at least one case of the disorder has been reported in which the 
individual had taken less than 100 milligrams of the supplement daily, the FDA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
EMS is marked by severe muscle and joint pain, breathing difficulties, swelling 
of the arms and legs, skin rash and sometimes fever. In some cases, victims 
show signs of congestive heart failure and paralysis.

George Bush, still harboring a childhood grudge against broccoli, escalated the 
rhetoric today in his one-man war against the vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my 
mother made me eat it and I'm President of the United States and I'm not going 
to eat any more broccoli," Bush proclaimed to cheers and laughter at the close 
of an outdoor news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's forthright stand has brought howls from broccoli growers, who are 
shipping 10 tons of the green, flowery vegetable from California to the 
nation's capital to feed the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, look. This is the last statement I'm going to have on broccoli," Bush 
said. "There are truckloads of broccoli at this very minute descending on 
Washington. My family is divided." 
</P>
<P>
But the President admitted that at least one member of the Bush family likes 
broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
"For the broccoli vote out there: Barbara loves broccoli. She has tried to make 
me eat it. She eats it all the time herself," Bush said. "So she can go out and 
meet the caravan of broccoli that's coming in."

U.S., SOVIETS REACH PACT ON GRAIN SALES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: U.S.S.R. WILL BUY MORE THAN $1-BILLION WORTH OF AMERICAN FARMERS' 
PRODUCTS ANNUALLY UNDER TERMS OF FIVE-YEAR DEAL.

<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union have reached agreement on a new grain 
purchase that guarantees more than $1 billion of annual American grain sales to 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was announced in Washington today by U.S. Agriculture Secretary 
Clayton K. Yeutter and Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year pact calls for minimum Soviet purchases of at least 10 million 
metric tons of U.S. wheat, corn, soybeans or soy meal exports to the Soviet 
Union each year. That is up from 9 million tons in the current pact. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement will succeed the current one, which expires next Dec. 31. 
Moscow will also have greater flexibility in choosing between purchasing wheat 
and feed grains on a year-to-year basis. 
</P>
<P>
The new pact was agreed to at a meeting in Vienna between U.S. and Soviet 
negotiators and was hailed by Yeutter and Hills as "a welcome advance in the 
relations between the United States and the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
Julius Katz, deputy U.S. trade representative, said in Vienna, "We think this 
is a good deal, that it assures U.S. farmers of a stable market over the life 
of the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter said only a few technical issues remained to be worked out. He said the 
agreement should be ready to be signed within a few weeks and possibly could be 
finalized at the U.S.-Soviet summit in June. 
</P>
<P>
An Administration spokesman said the grain would be sold at "competitive" terms 
and dodged a question if that meant subsidized prices might be offered. The 
United States has routinely offered discounts on wheat. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Soviet grain pacts stretch back to the mid-1970s. They help lock in 
exports for American farmers and protect the Soviet Union, the world's biggest 
grain buyer, against supply disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Even when President Jimmy Carter suspended grain trade with the Kremlin in 1980 
because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Soviet Union was allowed to 
buy the grain specified in the grain agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new pact, the Soviet Union will be required to purchase annually at 
least 4 million tons each of wheat and feed grain with a balance that can be 
fulfilled with purchases of wheat, feed grains, soybeans or soybean meal. 
</P>
<P>
In any one year the Soviet Union can substitute up to 750,000 tons of one 
commodity for another. 
</P>
<P>
At the first round of grain talks last December, the Soviet Union asked that 
the minimum purchase level be cut to 6 million tons of grain, but the United 
States said it could not accept anything lower than 9 million tons.

EASTERN PILOTS AGREE TO INTERIM 25% PAY CUT THROUGH MEDIATOR

Eastern Airlines today announced an interim contract agreement with its pilots 
union that calls for a 25% wage cut and said the pact does not call for 
rehiring those who walked out in March of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern also warned that the pact was temporary and would have to be 
renegotiated by July 1 because it allows for only about half the cost 
reductions the debt-plagued carrier requires to emerge from Chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern insisted the National Mediation Board would have to continue efforts to 
reach a permanent agreement to further cut costs. Spokesmen for the pilots 
union could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"If expedited mediation is not successful in leading to such an arrangement, 
Eastern . . . will have to promptly seek bankruptcy court permission to achieve 
full cost reductions on a long-term basis," the carrier said in its release. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots and the airline have been meeting since September under the auspices 
of the mediation board. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's approximately 850 pilots are being paid at the pre-strike wage rate 
of about $72,000 a year and under the agreement would take a 25% cut. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the cuts would not affect approximately 950 
replacement pilots, who earn $27,500 a year. Their pay would not be raised to 
the same contract levels as pre-strike pilots.

DOW DIVES 32.21 AFTER BIG SELL-OFF IN JAPAN

Wall Street lost its immunity today to the big stock sell-off in Tokyo, closing 
sharply lower after a rapid dive in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.21 points at 2,695.72, but 
above its low for the session. At around 2:25 p.m. EST, the index had fallen as 
low as 2,678.60, off 49.33 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outstripped advances by around 3 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,194 down, 358 up and 410 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 175.93 million shares, up from 130.99 million in 
Wednesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
Losers outpaced gainers by a 4-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight decline on the New York Stock Exchange, following a 
vigorous rally in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Traders awoke in New York to find the Tokyo market had dropped by 3.13%, 
bringing its loss so far this year to about 23%. New York investors could not 
withstand the pressure of Tokyo's loss and began taking profits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a belated reaction to the Japanese market," said Charles Jensen, an 
analyst for MKI Securities Corp. "We've been ignoring that market for a couple 
of weeks. You can only ignore reality for so long." 
</P>
<P>
"The market was overextended," said Monte Gordon, vice president and director 
of research at Dreyfus Corp. "You would expect the market to retrace." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained a net 57.89 points to 
2,741.22, its highest level since early January. The advance continued on 
Monday, as the blue-chip barometer picked up another 14.41 points. But it 
stalled in Tuesday's trading and the retreat was extended Wednesday and today. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices gained ground this morning as worries about the prolonged slide in 
Tokyo's stock market attracted investors to the relative safety of U.S. 
government securities. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's recent strong performance, tensions in the Soviet Union and 
uncertainty about German unification also drew buyers to the U.S. bond market. 
</P>
<P>
The market's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond spurted 5/8 point, or $6.25 per 
$1,000 in face value, more than recouping Wednesday's loss of 3/8 point. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which goes down when prices go up, fell to 8.43% from 8.49% late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose that we could probably describe it best as some form of flight to 
quality," said Robert Brusca, an economist and fixed-income analyst at Nikko 
Securities Co. International Inc. "People are reminded that the United States 
continues to play a strong power role in the world economy." 
</P>
<P>
Weakness on Wall Street in the aftermath of another tumble on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange also benefited bonds.

South Korea has resolved a dispute with the United States over beef imports, 
averting possible trade sanctions, Trade Ministry officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached after three days of talks that ended Wednesday in 
Washington, Seoul will increase its beef import quota to 58,000 metric tons 
this year from 50,000 last year, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The quota will rise to 62,000 metric tons in 1991 and 66,000 in 1992, according 
to the accord. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. negotiators originally asked us to submit a schedule for total 
liberalization of beef imports but later agreed to accept our offer to increase 
the annual quota," a ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Seoul and Washington will hold talks before July, 1992, to discuss the 
possibility of removing South Korea's beef import barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Washington had threatened to impose a ban on some South Korean imports unless 
Seoul opened its markets to more American beef.

The Oldsmobile division of General Motors Corp. announced today a $1,000 rebate 
on its new Silhouette minivan, with GM's Pontiac and Chevrolet divisions 
expected to make similar offers, all in efforts to undermine robust sales of 
Chrysler Corp.'s models. 
</P>
<P>
Oldsmobile's offer, which starts Friday, runs until May 2 and includes an 
alternative of low-rate financing. 
</P>
<P>
The move by GM came after Chrysler placed a $1,000 rebate on its front-drive 
Caravan, Voyager and Town &amp; Country minivans last December under a program 
that expired Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler saw January sales of those already popular models soar 67% from the 
previous month because of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said Chrysler had no plans at this 
time to offer another rebate on its minivans.

Italians are all set for their first taste of pay television -- a cocktail of 
X-rated movies, sex therapy and what is billed as an erotic version of candid 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
Some 70,000 people have written in to say they want to join the "Pay-TV Italian 
Club" -- open to adults only -- and buy the decoder needed to receive the 
broadcasts for $200. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be a hard-core TV," pledged the station's director, Roberto 
Artigiani. "You can call it soft erotica if you want," said the 47-year-old 
Artigiani. "We'll tackle sex in an open, intelligent way, without false 
moralism or propriety." 
</P>
<P>
His first coded signals are due to go on the air at 1 a.m. one night in 
mid-April. First, "Perfume of Love" -- 10 minutes of viewers' letters. Then a 
sex therapy session, a game show, a cabaret dominated by strip-tease, and 
finally a movie, taking viewers to closing time at 3 a.m.

The materials shed light on Joyce's years in Paris, the university said. Very 
few scholars have had access to the material, although a handful of the Pound 
letters have been published, an official said. The letters discuss various

Surgeons today implanted metal rods in pop singer Gloria Estefan's back, broken 
when a tractor-trailer rig plowed into her tour bus. 
</P>
<P>
The operation on the lead singer of the Miami Sound Machine was expected to 
last three or four hours. 
</P>
<P>
Before the operation began about 8:30 a.m., doctors at the Hospital for Joint 
Diseases in Manhattan said that the 32-year-old singer's chances of recovery 
are "excellent," and that the risk of paralysis is "exceedingly rare." 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons explained that the surgery was designed to correct "subluxation," an 
instability of the spine between her middle and lower back that can include 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
Estefan, who was injured Tuesday when the tractor-trailer rig hit her tour bus 
on snowy Interstate 380 in the Pocono Mountains in Tobyhanna, Pa., was flown 
Wednesday by helicopter to New York from a hospital in Scranton, Pa., where she 
was taken after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Neuwirth, the New York hospital's chief of spinal surgery, who will 
implant the two 8-inch rods at the junction between Estefan's middle and lower 
back, said Wednesday that her prognosis was "excellent." 
</P>
<P>
"The risk of paralysis is exceedingly rare," Neuwirth said.

The first re-recordings of all of the late conductor Arturo Toscanini's 
performances for the RCA record label will go on sale April 3 on digitally 
remastered compact discs, cassettes, laser discs and VHS videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Guenter Hensler, president of BMG Classics, which owns RCA, said the collection 
would offer "the most faithful sound reproduction possible" and had been 
authorized by Toscanini's family. 
</P>
<P>
The original masters from the recording sessions were used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most important releases in the history of recording," 
Hensler said. "It is the definitive release of Toscanini's legacy on CD, the 
one he wanted to leave to posterity. The collection of 71 titles on 82 compact 
discs and 81 cassettes, including seven boxed sets, will be released over a 
four-year period on the medium-priced RCA Victor Gold Seal label. 
</P>
<P>
It will include concert performances of Verdi's "Aida," "Falstaff" and 
"Requiem" and the Beethoven and Brahms symphonic cycles.

Anthony Quinn says he's never been scared of dying, not even by heart bypass 
surgery. But he admitted making out a will before he underwent surgery last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn called the operation "a breeze" in an interview taped Wednesday for "The 
Joan Rivers Show." 
</P>
<P>
"It's complicated for the doctor, but for you it's very simple," the 
75-year-old actor said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he made out the will before going under the knife, he said the thought 
of dying doesn't worry him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been afraid of death," he said. "I don't think it exists. . . . I 
think it's just a change that you go through. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a light at the other end of a tunnel that is just another life, and I 
think it's a better life than this one, without all the wars and all the hunger 
and all the nonsense that's going on now." 
</P>
<P>
The interview will be broadcast Friday.

Browns tight end Ozzie Newsome said today that he intends to play another 
season in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome, 34, had considered retiring after last season. Instead, he will play 
his 13th season with the Browns, who made him a No. 1 draft pick out of Alabama 
in 1978. He has the most receptions of any tight end in NFL history, 639, and 
ranks fifth in career receptions among all pass receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome met last weekend with Browns owner Art Modell before making his 
decision to return.

"We have a tentative agreement with Karsten Manufacturing (the maker of Ping 
clubs) as the underwriters of the first-ever Ryder Cup event for the LPGA," the 
organization said. "We are still trying to finalize the name and the site and 
we are still in negotiation with Europe on these selections."

Oilers halfback Lorenzo White has asked to be traded, and General Manager Mike 
Holovak said he will honor that request, the third by White. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'll try," Holovak said Wednesday. "There's interest in Lorenzo because 
he's a darn good back, but nothing's hot right now." White, the Oilers' No. 1 
pick in 1988, has languished on the bench behind Mike Rozier and Allen Pinkett 
for the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Oilers are going to the run-and-shoot offense, which employs only 
one back, officials said White and Rozier can be traded for draft choices or 
other players.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse says he's coming along fine after 
implant surgery to receive an experimental hip coated with a synthetic 
bone-like material. 
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old NFL club owner is getting around with a walker or crutches. If 
X-rays look promising, doctors figure he should be able to put full weight on 
his left leg in two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's going along great," Culverhouse said. He was among the first to 
undergo the surgery. The artificial hip was implanted Feb. 14 at The Florida 
Orthopaedics Institute.

Third-seeded Stefan Edberg won two of three tiebreakers and benefited from a 
disputed lineman's call late in the match to beat unseeded Jakob Hlasek today 
in the quarterfinals of the International Players Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg won 6-7 (9-7), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
His opponent in Friday's semifinals will be No. 15 seed Emilio Sanchez, who 
beat No. 10 Martin Jaite 6-3, 6-3 today. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg and Hlasek were tied 6-6 in the third-set tiebreaker when Hlasek hit a 
forehand volley down the line and out of Edberg's reach. After a moment's 
delay, the lineman called the ball out. 
</P>
<P>
After disputing the ruling with the chair umpire, Hlasek double-faulted, then 
hit a backhand shot wide to give Edberg the victory. An angry Hlasek walked 
over to the lineman and shook his hand before shaking Edberg's, prompting boos 
from the crowd.
