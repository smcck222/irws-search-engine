JUDGE OVERTURNS S.D. TAX FOR JAILS; 
</P>
<P>
RULING ON PROP. A DEALS SEVERE BLOW TO COUNTY'S PLANS TO SOLVE CROWDING 
</P>

In a decision with potentially far-reaching implications, a Superior Court 
judge Thursday struck down a half-cent sales tax narrowly approved by San Diego 
voters last June to raise $1.6 billion for new jails and courts on the grounds 
that the measure violates Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling that county officials "purposely circumvented" Proposition 13's 
requirement of a two-thirds vote for approval of new taxes, Riverside County 
Judge Gordon Burkhart accepted opponents' arguments that San Diego voters' 
50.6% support for the sales tax was insufficient for its adoption. Accordingly, 
Burkhart -- who heard the case in Riverside because of San Diego judges' 
conflict of interest on a matter affecting future courtroom space -- ruled the 
Proposition A election invalid. 
</P>
<P>
That decision not only will exacerbate, at least temporarily, San Diego's 
longstanding problems of jail crowding and a badly overextended court system, 
but also has statewide importance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Counties Watching 
</P>
<P>
If upheld on appeal, Burkhart's ruling could pose problems for other counties 
that were closely watching the San Diego case for guidance on meeting criminal 
justice and other needs. Legal ratification of Proposition A, lawyers on both 
sides of the case agree, would make it easier to fatten civic treasuries by 
eliminating the need for the formidable two-thirds margin for new taxes 
mandated by Proposition 13, the landmark property-tax cutting initiative 
approved by statewide voters in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to win a case against the government or to overturn an election, 
but we always felt we had the facts and the law on our side," said a jubilant 
Thomas Homann, one of seven defense attorneys who filed the lawsuit on behalf 
of two Libertarian Party members and a leader of the 100-member United 
Taxpayers of San Diego. "It's gratifying that the judge saw Proposition A for 
what it was: a ruse to circumvent Proposition 13." 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling . . . points out that the Board of Supervisors is not above the 
law," added Louis Katz, one of Homann's colleagues. "We have not solved the 
jail crisis. But breaking the law to lock up supposed lawbreakers is not the 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
Shocked county leaders, distressed over the prospect of losing in court what 
they won at the polls, glumly sought to minimize their disappointment by 
describing Thursday's decision as simply the first round in a legal battle 
expected to reach the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed, but this isn't the end of the world, either," 
Supervisor George Bailey said. "It was a foregone conclusion that whoever lost 
the first round would appeal to the second, and the loser there would appeal to 
the Supreme Court in the third round. I naturally would have preferred to win 
the first round, but we still think we're going to prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Susan Golding added: "The citizens of San Diego 
have lost the first round. My feelings go beyond disappointment to 
unadulterated concern for what's going to happen to public safety in this 
county if this decision isn't reversed. The results could be disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
With an appeal before the 4th District Court of Appeal expected to take as long 
as one year, one of the key questions left unanswered Thursday is whether 
collection of the tax must be halted in the interim. Although Burkhart ruled 
Proposition A invalid, his five-page order apparently leaves execution of that 
judgment in the hands of local officials. 
</P>
<P>
Rhetorically asking, "How can you collect a tax that a court says is illegal?" 
Homann argued that the tax should be immediately rescinded when Burkhart signs 
a final order in the case, probably in about one week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still More Delays 
</P>
<P>
Several county officials, however, said they plan to continue collecting 
revenue from the half-cent sales tax pending the appellate decisions. Siding 
with that approach, state Board of Equalization member Ernest Dronenburg Jr. 
explained that his agency traditionally "waits to hear from the court of final 
jurisdiction . . . before undoing a tax." 
</P>
<P>
If upheld, Thursday's ruling would force county officials to confront another 
complicated and politically sensitive fiscal question: how to equitably refund 
the estimated $21 million collected during the past 2 1/2 months. None of that 
money, now held by the Board of Equalization but soon to be forwarded to the 
county, has been spent. 
</P>
<P>
Although professing confidence that they will eventually win the case, county 
officials concede that the lawsuit already has delayed some jail-building plans 
and put administrative planning by the body set up to oversee the sales-tax 
funds far behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Were it not for the lawsuit, the San Diego County Regional Justice Facility 
Financing Agency, the seven-member board that administers the funds generated 
by Proposition A, could have secured a tax-anticipation loan last summer to 
begin hiring staff and proceed with certain projects, according to Rich 
Robinson, head of the county's special projects office. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty posed by the lawsuit, however, left the agency, as Sheriff John 
Duffy put it recently, "stuck at square one" with its budget and plans on hold, 
as well as derailed a plan to expedite construction of nearly 1,000 beds at the 
county's planned East Otay Mesa jail, scheduled to be completed in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
With crowding in jails and courts worsening, Thursday's decision was all the 
more frustrating to county officials who realized that it means, at best, more 
delays in solving that thorny problem. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, the inmate population in the county's jails totaled 4,054 -- 222% 
of the official 1,827-bed capacity. A serious backlog in criminal cases, 
meanwhile, recently prompted Superior Court Judge Michael Greer to postpone all 
new civil trials for several weeks and led the Board of Supervisors to approve 
the construction of five temporary courtrooms in a 77-year-old downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Explosive Situation' 
</P>
<P>
"What this means is that some judges perhaps can anticipate spending their 
entire judicial career in the Hotel San Diego," said Presiding Municipal Court 
Judge E. Mac Amos, lacing his disappointment with bittersweet humor. 
</P>
<P>
Predicting that Thursday's decision "means that our problems are going to get 
worse before they get better," Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Alan Fulmer 
exhibited similar gallows humor, noting that the ruling came only two days 
after a Grand Jury report sharply criticized the sheriff's operation of the 
jails and confirmed that inmates were frequently beaten by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"This has not exactly been a great week for the Sheriff's Department -- or, as 
far as this (ruling) is concerned, for the general public, either," Fulmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as "more disgusted about what this means for the jails" than 
over delays in courthouse expansion, Greer expressed concern that postponing 
jail construction could worsen the "already explosive situation" detailed in 
the Grand Jury report. 
</P>
<P>
"People are being hurt, and I hate to think that more may be hurt before this 
gets solved," Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit that spawned Thursday's decision, Katz, Homann and their five 
colleagues described the 1987 state legislation that set the stage for last 
June's Proposition A campaign as a "sham" that illegally circumvented both the 
spirit and letter of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1987 law, the revenues generated by Proposition A -- estimated at 
$1.6 billion over its 10-year life -- were to be administered by the Regional 
Justice Facility Financing Agency. The funds, in turn, would be spent in accord 
with plans developed and approved by the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The primary purpose behind the creation of the agency, Katz argued, was to 
"exploit loopholes" in Proposition 13 created by California Supreme Court 
rulings exempting local agencies not authorized to levy property taxes from the 
two-thirds vote requirement. County and state legislators sought that 
"back-door method" for approval of Proposition A, Katz added, after a similar 
five-year, half-cent sales tax for jails on the November, 1986, ballot failed 
when it drew a narrow 50.7% majority, far short of the then-required two-thirds 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
But Katz argued that Proposition A still should have been subject to the 
two-thirds requirement because the seven-member agency "is not an independent 
governmental entity," but rather is "merely an agency and alter ego . . . of 
the Board of Supervisors" -- which can levy property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In response, County Counsel Lloyd Harmon and the Financing Agency's attorney, 
Lynn McDougal, contended that proceeds from the half-cent sales tax would 
finance "general governmental purposes" administered by the agency, a critical 
semantic distinction that would exempt it from the two-thirds requirement. In 
addition, county leaders emphasized that the state legislation that set up the 
Financing Agency specifically authorized a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhart, however, wrote in his decision that the agency "was founded solely 
for the purpose of avoiding the strictures of Proposition 13." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disservice to Public' 
</P>
<P>
"The court finds that the tax here is placed in the agency's treasury and was 
not to be spent for any general purpose the county wishes, but rather must be 
spent for the special purposes of constructing and operating justice 
facilities," Burkhart said in his ruling. As a "special tax," the half-cent 
sales tax therefore required a two-thirds vote under the guidelines established 
by Proposition 13, the judge added. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't have said it better ourselves," said Libertarian Dick Rider, one 
of the plaintiffs. "The county tried to wink at Proposition 13 and play games 
here. And this judge said, 'You can't do that.' We've done the taxpayers a big 
favor." 
</P>
<P>
Golding, however, characterized the lawsuit as "a real disservice to the 
public," and suggested that the appeal of Thursday's decision might create an 
opportunity to pose what she called "the very necessary challenge" of the 
controversial two-thirds vote requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"What is extraordinary in this case is that people in San Diego County were 
willing to tax themselves again, but a legal roadblock is preventing that from 
happening," Golding said. "At some point, when a majority of citizens isn't 
allowed to make a decision, we're going to have trouble functioning as a 
government. Government was built on majority rule and maybe this appeal will be 
a chance to get back to that principal."

Afghan guerrillas blew up a bridge on the only paved road from Kabul to 
Jalalabad, the Afghan government said, disrupting supplies to the city chosen 
as the rebels' first major objective after the Soviet troop withdrawal was 
completed last month. But a spokesman said that three other roads, all unpaved 
and more circuitous, remain open. He said the bridge near Sarobi, about midway 
between the capital and Jalalabad, 75 miles to the east, was one of about 100 
on the highway. Muslim rebels launched their offensive against Jalalabad on 
March 6, but their drive has bogged down in the face of strong opposition.

A mayoral task force in San Francisco has endorsed giving clean needles to drug 
addicts to slow the spread of AIDS, but police and health officials said that 
no such city program was likely without changes in state law. Police Chief 
Frank Jordan said he supported such a program, but he added that the city could 
not begin one now because state law bans giving needles to anyone without a 
doctor's prescription. "We have to experiment with all kinds of creative ways" 
to stop acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Jordan said. However, "it is quite 
clear that it is a misdemeanor," he added. Public Health Director David 
Werdegar said he was trying to determine whether he can get "administrative 
permission" for starting a small-scale project that would allow the 
distribution of clean needles to addicts.

Iran's interior minister said that the execution order against British author 
Salman Rushdie will be carried out despite the efforts of what he described as 
"world colonial powers," Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said. Ali 
Akbar Mohtashemi met with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who issued the order 
last month. "World colonial and arrogant powers should know the children of 
Islam will execute the divine ruling against deviated people, apostates and 
others trying to fight Islam," Mohtashemi said. The death order was issued 
against Rushdie for his novel "The Satanic Verses," which many Muslims see as 
blasphemous.

RAINFALL ELATES CENTRAL VALLEY

Substantial rainfall in Northern and Central California during the last few 
weeks will enable the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to increase water deliveries 
to Central Valley farmers to 80% of normal and fully meet its contracts with 
most municipal customers, federal officials said. "Thank God for the rain," 
said Jason Peltier, head of the Central Valley Water Assn. "We're out of what 
was really a crisis situation. . . ." However, the officials said some areas -- 
including San Francisco, the Santa Clara Valley and the eastern side of the San 
Joaquin Valley -- still aren't guaranteed full deliveries because the rains 
skipped portions of the Sierra watershed that supply them.

The Sudanese government and rebels in southern Sudan have agreed to a "month of 
tranquillity" to permit passage of food needed to avert a famine, a U.N. 
official said. James P. Grant, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund 
(UNICEF), said the plan calls for eight "corridors of peace" through which 
relief supplies will flow. The lull in fighting is to begin April 1 to allow 
hauling of supplies before rains that begin in May make roads impassable.

 -- A businessman with a lot of dough and a craving for Russian pumpernickel 
has struck a deal with the Soviet Union to fly 2,000 loaves a week to New York 
consumers. "I thought it was an interesting metaphor -- breaking bread with the 
Russians; I call it peace bread," said Fred Kayden, of Harrison, N.Y., who 
describes himself as a "retired multimillionaire." Kayden developed a taste for 
Russian bread during his business travels, and always brought home a few 
loaves. "It's like old-fashioned bread, with no preservatives," he said. Valery 
Saikin, chairman of the Moscow city council, arranged the venture with help 
from Aeroflot and the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council. The bread will 
be served at the Waldorf-Astoria and New York Hilton hotels, as well as at 15 
New York area stores at a price of $4 to $5 for a two-pound loaf.

Reagan, who has been recovering at home, is "feeling better." He said that 
since leaving the White House, Mrs. Reagan has had to unpack and move into 
their new Bel-Air home and travel to New York to work on her book with 
biographer William Novak.

 -- Queen Elizabeth II distributed purses of specially minted "Maundy" money at 
St. Philip's Cathedral in Birmingham as part of a centuries-old Easter 
tradition. The purses, each containing 63 pence ($1.08), were handed out to 63 
men and 63 women -- one for each year of her life. Each year a different 
cathedral is chosen for the ceremony, which is always held the Thursday before 
Easter and dates back to the 12th Century. Originally, the monarch also washed 
the feet of those who received Maundy money to commemorate Jesus' washing his 
disciples' feet, but this tradition was halted in 1730.

In the latest round of tit-for-tat diplomacy between Washington and Moscow, 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has ordered a New York-based Soviet trade 
official to leave the United States by next week, it was announced. With two 
Soviets expelled from the United States and one American from Moscow thus far 
this month, State Department spokesman Charles Redman expressed hope there will 
be no further expulsions. The ouster of Sergei Malinin, an employee of the 
Soviet trade organization Amtorg, was in retaliation for Moscow's expulsion of 
a U.S. Army attache from the Soviet Union last week. Redman said Baker told 
Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin he was concerned by the Soviet expulsion of Army 
Lt. Col. Francis Van Gundy on March 14.

A South Korean firm has seized the president of a Japanese machinery company 
for the second time in four months in a business dispute, and his whereabouts 
are unknown, his company said in Tokyo. Koji Kohno of the Japanese company 
Osawa Press Seisakusho said the firm has received demands from Namil Machine 
Co. in South Korea for $3.8 million. He said recent messages declared that 
Osawa Press President Tokuo Osawa had been beaten and that one of his fingers 
would be cut off and sent to back up demands for payment. The messages also 
threatened Osawa's family, Kohno said. The dispute stems from six press 
machines Osawa sold to the South Korean firm last year that Namil says are 
defective. Osawa went to South Korea to offer technical assistance.

Deteriorating weather has forced the Argentine navy to halt efforts to clean up 
a fuel oil spill from a ship that went aground Jan. 28 near an American 
research station in the Antarctic. A statement released by the Argentine 
Embassy in Washington said that five naval ships that had been participating in 
contamination control work are being withdrawn "due to glacier and 
meteorological conditions." The statement said that oil spilled from the 
Argentine supply ship Bahia Paraiso has been removed from the sea surface and 
that all "potential pollutants" have been removed from the wrecked ship. 
American experts, however, say that about 50,000 gallons of fuel oil are still 
aboard the ship.

Rival gangs squared off at a funeral service for a slain teen-ager in San 
Francisco's Hunters Point district, but police were able to intervene and 
prevent violence. The confrontation occurred between the Swampy Desert gang 
from the Sunnydale housing project and the rival Hunters Point gang. The groups 
come from housing projects located about two miles apart and police believe 
they are involved in a turf battle for control of the lucrative crack cocaine 
trade. Police said they were able to get between the gangs and break up a 
hostile situation that occurred just after the funeral of Edric Carr, a member 
of the Swampy Desert gang who was also known as Peter Lee. Carr was shot and 
killed March 14 as he sat in a friend's car in Hunters Point. He was buried at 
Colma cemetery, his gang cap resting on top of his casket and with a sign 
reading, "Pete, Rest In Peace."

I couldn't help gloating when I read Leon Tsao's letter describing his family 
(Feb. 27). With such phrases as "mongrel bunch," "hybrid vigor in the 
offspring," and "more fit for survival than the intolerant," Tsao should 
forever put to rest the myth of the "Aryan master race." To the "Not-sees," 
Skinheads, Ku Klux Klan, David Duke, and other bigoted, racist know-nothings: 
"Foiled again!"

MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The steady deterioration of the local mental health system is seen everywhere 
in California but it is particularly stunning in the context of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 8 million residents of Los Angeles County, 1.2 million are in need of 
mental health care. Of the 1.2 million who are in need of mental health care, 
almost half suffer from major mental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
The most chilling aspect of these dire statistics is the utilization in 
comparison to the need. The county's mental health system is only able to 
assist 90,000 people in a group whose numbers exceed 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
For those people who do receive some form of attention much of it is 
substandard. 
</P>
<P>
The recent proposal from Los Angeles County to close several outpatient clinics 
and scale back services in most remaining clinics has dramatically illustrated 
the public emergency that exists in our mental health treatment system. If this 
new proposal to scale back what is already a horrendously inadequate system is 
approved, 20,000 more people will have to go without needed treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The simple fact is that the chronically mentally ill do not disappear when 
needed services are not available to them. They just get worse. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental problem is our funding crisis which must be faced by all levels 
of government. Counties as well as the state must do everything within their 
power to minimize the damage of fiscal constraints on their population. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's budget will soon deliver the coup de grace to Los Angeles' 
already ailing mental health system by cutting 40% of existing local mental 
health funding. The only way the Legislature can stop this imminent threat to 
the county's funding is to rob Peter to pay Paul by eliminating family 
planning, cost-of-living increases for poor children, the aged, and the 
disabled in addition to decreasing funding for county public health. 
</P>
<P>
We are in governmental gridlock: We do not have the funds to maintain current 
services, and if funds were to materialize miraculously, the Gann limit would 
prevent us from using them. 
</P>
<P>
We are out of money and out of alternatives. The changes in our tax and 
expenditure system have left us no room in which to maneuver. As your articles 
have shown, a business as usual attitude means clear and apparent disaster for 
the meager mental health services currently being provided by an overburdened 
system.

'THE GHOSTS OF KATYN FOREST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was glad to read ("The Ghosts of Katyn Forest," editorial, March 9) that the 
Communist Polish government has finally acknowledged the Soviet Union's 
responsibility for the massacre of more than 4,000 Polish officers in Katyn 
Forest during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
This has been official public knowledge in the U.S. for nearly 40 years, ever 
since a congressional special committee investigated the atrocity. The 
committee was established in September, 1951, and published its final report 
Dec. 22, 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Its published material included maps, photos of the stacked bodies in mass 
graves, a list of missing Polish officers identified as these corpses, and 
documents in both Russian and English. It also included testimony of 
eyewitnesses, international medical experts, and top United States officials. 
</P>
<P>
It established not only the Soviet Union's guilt, but also an Allied conspiracy 
of silence at the Nuremberg trials and a massive U.S. cover-up at the very 
highest levels of government.

MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I refer to your editorial "Answering a Distress Call," March 2. 
</P>
<P>
I go to a county mental health clinic in San Diego County. I see a psychiatrist 
for 15 minutes every six weeks. I take medicine. I believe that the homeless 
mentally ill should be placed in state hospitals until they can be placed on 
SSI and in a board-and-care home, or by themselves, or with their families. 
</P>
<P>
As a former mentally ill person, I was glad to get the shelter, food and 
medicine at a state hospital. It costs about $4,000 a month per person to be in 
a state hospital. It costs about $1,000 a month per person to be on SSI, 
Medi-Cal and live in the community. 
</P>
<P>
I am a pen pal with mental patients all over the country. Most of them are 
doing well. Many of them work full-time. I'm sure the police do take many 
mentally ill people to local hospitals which then ship them to the state 
hospitals until they can be placed. This happened to me in 1984. Please lobby 
for the hospitalization of the homeless mentally ill. The state should build 
new state hospitals.

TRADITION GUIDES, BUT ECONOMICS MUST FUEL OLVERA STREET'S PRESERVATION . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD ALATORRE, Richard Alatorre represents the 14th District on the Los 
Angeles City Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most Angelenos, particularly Latinos raised in Los Angeles, Olvera Street 
represents more than an escape to quaint Old Mexico where one can purchase 
maracas, eat taquitos and listen to a century-old ranchera. Olvera Street is 
also the birthplace of Los Angeles and the cornerstone of our city's proud 
Latino legacy. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, tragically, Olvera Street has faded from the vibrant and 
festive marketplace of our memories. Merchants sell their wares amid 
dilapidated buildings and loose brick walkways. Many of the historic structures 
need seismic reinforcing, and the puestos (market stands) need repair. There is 
insufficient parking. 
</P>
<P>
I have a vision for Olvera Street as a focal point of authentic Latino culture 
and history for all Southern Californians to enjoy. In addition to the physical 
renovations on the street, we must bring back the marimba bands, strolling 
mariachis, traditional clothing and authentic Mexican products. We must also 
take steps to ensure a viable economic future for Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step in making this happen, I included the area in my district 
during the 1986 City Council redistricting. I also sponsored the state 
legislation that transferred both ownership and management of the street from 
an unwieldy city-county-state oversight arrangement to the city alone, where 
the City Council could exercise oversight of Olvera Street revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
For the short and longer term, land use and planning measures must be created 
to ensure the integrity of Olvera Street's character and its economic vitality, 
so that it is not dwarfed by imminent development at Union Station, Terminal 
Annex and other projects bordering this small but precious walkway. 
</P>
<P>
To secure this future, I recently appointed an El Pueblo Neighborhood Blue 
Ribbon Task Force to provide thoughtful advice regarding growth in the Olvera 
Street neighborhood. The task force's first objective is to help make sure that 
the potential we all see for Olvera Street does not collapse from the weight of 
special interests, overzealous developers or big money. 
</P>
<P>
Complex and competing factors emerge in the equation for the successful 
preservation and future health of Olvera Street. While we endeavor to sustain 
the participation of the many merchants whose businesses are an integral part 
of the street, we must also create an economic package to furnish the capital 
needed to renovate and revitalize the street. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants, who lease their spaces from the city and have an obvious vested 
interest in Olvera Street's future, have created a development plan for the 
much needed face-lift. I agree with nearly every major element of the 
merchants' restoration plan and have agreed to include these in a city document 
inviting developers to bid on the project. 
</P>
<P>
This bid document will establish the criteria for the selection of a developer 
for the restoration and will specify requirements designed to protect the 
merchants and ensure that the look and feel of the street are preserved. 
Included are long-term leases, a relocation plan and the availability of new 
retail spaces on the street for existing merchants. I will also request that 
merchants be guaranteed the opportunity to purchase equity in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The entire process is structured to protect the merchants regardless of the 
developer selected. 
</P>
<P>
All who share the wish for a vibrant Olvera Street can take pride in our 
efforts to protect and preserve the birthplace of our city. If we are to do 
justice to our roots, culture, history and traditions -- if we are to preserve 
the legacy of Jose Moreno, Luis Quintero, Antonio Mesa and the other men and 
women who founded Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles in 1781 -- the marimba 
must once again be heard in the plaza, and the Olvera Street of tomorrow must 
equal La Calle Olvera of our childhood memories.

BAKER MUST CLIP WINGERS ON CONTRA AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN SCHRAM, Martin Schram writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, a secretary of state was trapped in the tribulations of shuttle 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Like Henry Kissinger's imbroglios in the Middle East and Alexander Haig's 
peacemaker Ping-Pong between the Falkland war machines of London and Buenos 
Aires, James A. Baker III bounced from one fractious summit to the next. 
</P>
<P>
Only Baker never left town to do it. 
</P>
<P>
In a mission of unprecedented duration, this secretary of state spent a week on 
Capitol Hill shuttling between demagogues and demigods, and a smattering of 
statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
His plan: Win broad, bipartisan backing for a document that spells out the new 
U.S. policy supporting the Central American presidents' effort to bring 
democracy to Nicaragua and repatriate the Contra rebels, and provide 
humanitarian aid to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
His problem: Deep-seated distrust of the wingers -- that is, the 
arch-conservatives of the right and arch-liberals of the left -- each hoping to 
scuttle the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
His plea: Ron and Ollie don't work here anymore. Trust me on that. And vote to 
give the Contras one more pay period -- $41 million for the next 10 months for 
humanitarian aid only. 
</P>
<P>
It is a decent and even humane plan that is being opposed by many in the 
congressional rank and file for all the wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the past week, Baker shuttled between clusters of party leaders 
gathered in the offices of the Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader, 
the Speaker of the House and the House minority leader. At each stop, he'd pull 
the same two-page paper from his pocket and patiently go over it, paragraph by 
paragraph, line by line. At each stop, objections and accusations would be 
heard -- the conservatives had one set of complaints, the liberals another. 
</P>
<P>
Unspoken was this bit of deliciously Washingtonian irony: As Baker worked his 
diplo-politico fandango up and down the halls of Congress, the underlying cause 
of everyone's complaints was being revealed just three blocks away, in the 
halls of justice. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of Oliver North was laying bare the true deceit of Ronald Reagan's 
Central America policy. Testimony has made clear our former President's 
contempt for Congress -- and the extent of his anti-democratic effort to 
subvert the will of the Senate and House by sneaking funds to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
We now know that after Congress voted down military aid to the Contras, Reagan 
made a secret deal with Honduras to get the job done -- even though he has 
sworn that he didn't know his own National Security Council staff was doing 
anything to help the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed to provide Honduras with military and economic aid in exchange for 
that country's willingness to let the Contras operate bases and receive arms 
shipments in their territory, just across the border from Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
That is the policy that Sen. Jesse Helms favors even to this day; 
Administration officials believe Helms wants the Baker initiative to fall apart 
so we can go back to a good ol' war. 
</P>
<P>
And that is the policy that the liberals -- especially those in the House -- 
fear will bubble up anew in George Bush's White House. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been lied to routinely by the Sandinistas and the Contras," says Rep. 
David Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign 
Operations. "It's a hell of a mess. I haven't trusted the Sandinistas, the 
Contras or the executive branch of my own government." 
</P>
<P>
Just winning the support of the party leaders is not enough, as Baker sees it. 
He says it's important to have a majority of both parties behind the plan to 
show that, in the wake of our failed Central American strategies, the United 
States can finally achieve continuity in its own policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough to have a policy that's cobbled together by getting 25 
Democrats to vote with every Republican," said Obey. 
</P>
<P>
Five Central American presidents have agreed on a peace plan under which 
Nicaragua will hold elections no later than Feb. 25 of next year and will 
permit campaigning by parties in opposition to the Sandinistas. And by May 16 
of this year, the presidents will complete a plan for the Contras' "voluntary 
demobilization, repatriation or relocation." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration wants money for food and shelter to keep the Contras in 
place until elections are held in Nicaragua. But House liberals want to kill 
all funding for fear that, if the elections are not held, the Contras will pick 
up arms again. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of very concerned liberals who are unwilling to vote any more 
aid for the Contras -- regardless of what our party leaders tell Jim Baker they 
favor," says California Rep. Robert Matsui. 
</P>
<P>
My fellow liberals are well-meaning but wrong on this one. Our complaint was 
with the policy-makers, never with the individual Contra soldiers -- just as, 
in the Vietnam era, our complaint was against our policy-makers, not our heroic 
fighting men in the field. We must do all we can to ensure that the Contra 
soldiers will be treated well and fully repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
Our history in the support of freedom fighters is not exemplary. In the 1950s 
we encouraged and then turned our backs on the Hungarian freedom fighters; in 
the '60s we did the same for the brave men at the Bay of Pigs; in the '70s we 
left many gallant souls to undeserved fates in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
We owe it to the Contra soldiers to take our new President and secretary of 
state at their word -- and then make damn sure they keep it. 
</P>
<P>
EPILOGUE: At one of those dinner parties that fuels Washington, Bob Matsui, the 
liberal Democratic congressman, is talking shop with Sen. Dave Durenberger, the 
Minnesota Republican. The topic: the new push for a bipartisan foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of liberals will speak out against giving any money to the Contras," 
says Matsui. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger beams. "That's just what the wingers on the right want to hear," he 
says. "If your liberals speak out loudly enough against it, our wingers may be 
able to justify voting for it." 
</P>
<P>
What a country.

BOYCOTT BAN PROLONGS EASTERN STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
SECONDARY PICKETING COULD FORCE BUSH OR CONGRESS TO ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REGINALD ALLEYNE, Reginald Alleyne is a professor of law at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final outcome of the dispute between the machinists union and Eastern 
Airlines may hinge on how the courts, the President and Congress treat the 
union's attempts to extend its picketing to employers other than Eastern. 
Secondary boycotts are legal under the Railway Labor Act of 1926, which covers 
airlines and railroads. But the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, covering 
almost all other industries, prohibits such boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has described the two labor laws' 
different treatment of a secondary boycott as an "anomaly." He would prefer to 
make airline and railroad secondary boycotts unlawful. The real oddity in 
federal labor law, though, is not the lawful status of secondary boycotts in 
the airline and railroad industries, but the illegality of secondary boycotts 
in nearly all other industries. 
</P>
<P>
The two federal labor laws have the common objective of encouraging collective 
bargaining, in part by making employers bargain with unions if a majority of 
their employees want collective bargaining. The Railway Labor Act was a 
response to particularly violent strikes for recognition in the railroad 
industry. The National Labor Relations Act was a response to industrial strife 
over union recognition and the Depression. Both statutes protect the right to 
strike employers with whom a union has its primary dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary boycott ban has the attraction of simple logic. It protects 
"neutral" employers. It also reduces the ability of a powerful union to shut 
down the economy. For those two reasons, Congress in 1947 amended the National 
Labor Relations Act with the Taft-Hartley Act. Among other things, it outlawed 
the secondary boycott. The Taft-Hartley Act was passed because there had been 
an unusually large number of strikes immediately after World War II restraints 
on union strikes were lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Why does our national labor policy treat the secondary boycott differently in 
different major industries? Sen. Robert Taft responded to that question when 
his bill was debated on the floor of the Senate in June, 1947. He said: "There 
were no abuses which had arisen in connection with the operation of the Railway 
Labor Act . . . ." By "no abuses" he meant that after passage of the Railway 
Labor Act in 1926, railroads and airlines never experienced the same frequency 
of strikes, including secondary boycotts, that industries covered by the 
National Labor Relations Act had experienced. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously decided that secondary boycotts are 
not unlawful under the Railway Labor Act. Its decision in the Burlington 
Northern vs. Brotherhood of Maintenance Employees case reasoned that the 
Norris-La Guardia Act of 1932 prohibited federal courts from enjoining union 
picketing in labor disputes. The Norris-La Guardia Act was passed by Congress 
because of a long history of excessive and often unfair uses of injunctions 
against a wide range of union activities. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Norris-La Guardia Act and the Supreme Court's Burlington decision 
interpreting it, federal trial judges have enjoined the machinist union's 
attempts to boycott employers other than Eastern. Many federal judges are 
apparently unable to resist the temptation to save the country from what they 
perceive to be the harmful effects of a potentially disruptive strike. They 
have forgotten or are unwilling to accept that Congress has shifted 
governmental power over major strikes from the courts to Congress and the 
President, as evidenced by the Norris-La Guardia Act and the Burlington 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the current dispute, trial courts have enjoined the machinists' secondary 
boycott attempts on the dubious ground that they are not prohibiting secondary 
boycotts but sympathy strikes of other employees. However, an objective of the 
secondary boycott is to induce sympathy strikes by other employees against 
their employers. A sympathy strike induced by a lawful secondary boycott cannot 
logically become an unlawful sympathy strike. 
</P>
<P>
The Railway Labor Act has procedures designed to achieve voluntary peaceful 
settlements of labor disputes. The statute provides for mediation, voluntary 
arbitration, "cooling-off" periods and presidential emergency boards with power 
to make settlement recommendations that Congress can enact into law if the 
recommendations are not accepted by the employer and union. 
</P>
<P>
On how the possibility of a secondary boycott can help achieve settlement, the 
justices in the Burlington case unanimously concluded: 
</P>
<P>
"(I)n view of the interests of both parties in avoiding a strike . . . the 
availability of such self-help measures as secondary picketing may increase the 
effectiveness of (the Railway Labor Act) in settling major disputes by creating 
an incentive for the parties to settle prior to the exhaustion of the statutory 
procedures." 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the Railway Labor Act has worked without a secondary boycott ban. 
In the act's 63-year history, the secondary boycott has been used only three 
times in major railroad disputes. Until now, it has never been attempted in a 
major airline dispute. 
</P>
<P>
If federal judges had not blocked a secondary boycott, the mere threat of a 
prolonged one might have forced President Bush to convene an emergency board. 
Then, emergency board recommendations, either adopted by Eastern and the 
machinists union or, if necessary, enacted by Congress, would have terminated 
this now seemingly interminable dispute.

THE PROCLAIMERS' PURITY, PASSION

Yes, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, there is "quiet rock music" 
-- and the Proclaimers are a band that can wear that tag proudly. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the Scottish group is incapable of the energy and force to run 
afoul of the Central Park noise regulations -- the case that prompted Marshall 
to ask if rock has to be so l-o-u-d. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart of the Proclaimers' artistry, both on their new Chrysalis album 
and in their Southern California debut Wednesday night at the Bacchanal here, 
is their intimacy. For a band whose name suggests bold declarations, the 
Proclaimers speak with unusual gentleness and grace. The most affecting songs 
are as natural as the well-wishes of an old friend or the reassurances of a 
loved one. 
</P>
<P>
This warmth is accented by the vocal blend of the bespectacled twins who 
founded the band. Though they have been described as the Everly Brothers of 
Scotland, Craig and Charlie Reid, 26, don't reach for the sweet, choirlike 
harmonies of the Everlys. Rather, their voices, featuring a sometimes heavy 
brogue, weave together in an everyman bond that reinforces their themes of 
concern and support. 
</P>
<P>
More important is the Reids' writing. Their best songs about optimism and faith 
sound as if they are straight from the heart. "Sean," for instance, is a song 
about the birth of a baby that seems like a pure flush of emotion -- an uncanny 
capturing of a moment of joy: "Sean, I sat awhile on clouds to ask God if he's 
living / I should have spent the time on knees / In thanks for what he's 
given." 
</P>
<P>
The Proclaimers convey an equal intimacy in songs about social discontent. 
</P>
<P>
There is frustration and bite when the Reids strike out at social-political 
apathy in "Cap in Hand," but "What Do You Do?" captures marvelously the 
disillusionment of running against the political tide. Sample line: "What do 
you do? / When democracy fails you / What do you do / When minority means you?" 
</P>
<P>
The musical vision in these numbers is so personal that at times Wednesday the 
band's other five members almost seemed like intruders on stage. The point was 
underscored when the brothers stood by themselves midway through the 70-minute 
set and sang the wistful "Letter From America," a reflection on loyalty and 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
The Reids may feel the added instrumental bite is needed for variety and punch, 
but the Cowboy Junkies' recent success demonstrates that audiences will respond 
to intimate music when it is heartfelt. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean the Reids should return to their early folk-duo days. There 
were several times in Wednesday's performance when the band -- whose 
arrangements are nicely tailored with accordions and violins as well as guitars 
and drums -- was in perfect step with the brothers. Among them: a rollicking 
rendition of the old R&amp;B hit "(I'm Gonna) Burn Your Playhouse Down" and a 
version of their own "The Joyful Kilmarnock Blues" that had a revival-tent 
fervor. But the Reids could better showcase the intimacy that is their primary 
strength by combining two or three of their more delicate songs in an acoustic 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the show wasn't perfectly designed, the Proclaimers showed that they 
have a kinship with some of the most valuable and uplifting new forces in rock, 
including the Waterboys and Hothouse Flowers. In a pop world filled with 
calculation and self-conscious cleverness, this is music abounding with purity 
and passion. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which was scheduled to close the first leg of its U.S. tour Thursday 
night at the Roxy in West Hollywood, is expected to return to the West Coast in 
late April to resume the tour.

LEHNHOFF STAGES MODERN VERSION OF 'SALOME' AT MET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, Nikolaus Lehnhoff directed an epochal production of Richard 
Strauss' "Salome" in San Francisco. Dark, bleak and semi-abstract, it turned 
out to be a model of enlightened contemporary stagecraft. It respected the 
spirit of the decadent libretto while blithely redefining the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Now, trendily aggressive and progressive to a fault, Lehnhoff has created a 
"Salome" for the Metropolitan Opera that violates the spirit and the letter of 
the original. It looked fascinatingly awful at Lincoln Center on Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, a painful irony here. The Met doesn't dare or care to go 
modern very often. When it finally does, it goes wrong. First "Bluebeard's 
Castle" and "Erwartung." Now this. 
</P>
<P>
One can find much to admire in this emphatically original "Salome" -- so long 
as one doesn't happen to admire the specific intentions of the composer. 
Lehnhoff has invented lots of amusing gimmicks, some of which are mutually 
complementary, and he splashes them all across the vast Met stage with bravado. 
Jurgen Rose has created a staggering array of sleazy visual images that exert a 
compulsion all their own. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Wechsler has bathed the scenic orgy in expressionistic light and, where 
unavoidable, smothered it in moody shade. 
</P>
<P>
The stubbornly antiquated synopsis in the house program insists that the 
biblical action takes place "on a moonlit terrace of King Herod's palace in 
Judea." No way. 
</P>
<P>
Lehnhoff and Rose have given us a supersleazy basement in some black-walled, 
semi-expressionistic, neo-Nouveau disco. There is no moon. But there are lots 
of corpses lying around, not to mention glitzy matrons, supernumerary bimbos 
worthy of Weill and Brecht, and thugs borrowed from "Guys and Dolls." 
Picturesque and oh-so-meaningful poses are struck on fire escapes, amid oil 
barrels and in jarringly mis-angled doorways. 
</P>
<P>
This, clearly, is a nasty new world gone askew. It is delineated with careful 
thought, executed with loving detail. The effort is wasted, alas, within the 
given musico-dramatic context. 
</P>
<P>
The characters who inhabit the crazed environment are just that: characters. 
There is a petulant lady in a pink pomponed birthday-party dress who, in some 
sort of snit, peels off a few layers of outer skirts and throws her white 
gloves at a funny little guy in a tiger-skin shirt who does a lot of ranting. 
The lady, according to the program, is Salome. The funny little guy is Herod. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is a portentous hippy who lives under a subway grate and wears a 
white robe. That's John the Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
And we mustn't forget the dame with the spiked heels who has trouble navigating 
the raked ramps and can't seem to decide if she is supposed to impersonate 
Margaret Dumont or Mae West. That's Herodias. She makes her lascivious exit, by 
the way, on the arm of the big, bare-chested black slave who acts as the 
Baptist's decapitator. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, there is a potentially beguiling parody hidden somewhere among all 
this puerile indulgence. Too bad it has so little to do with Strauss' shocking 
eroticism, psychological thunder and poignant catharsis. 
</P>
<P>
Given the weird comings and goings on the stage, not to mention the vocal 
shortcomings and shortgoings of a mostly second-string-cast, Marek Janowski did 
the wisest possible thing in the pit. He put his head down and made music -- 
loud, clean and fast. 
</P>
<P>
The Salome at this performance -- possibly a dubious choice in the first place 
-- was supposed to have been Eva Marton. The Hungarian diva hastily left town, 
however, pleading illness after a well-publicized disagreement with the 
management regarding future assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Her alternate turned out to be Katarina Ikonomu, a Greek soprano from Tashkent 
who has sung the same role in the presumably more congenial productions of 
Paris, Zurich and Charleston. She looked reasonably attractive in her silly 
Shirley Temple costume and pouted deftly. However, she sketched Salome's 
insinuating, arching conflicts in bright, somewhat shrill tones that proved 
notable neither for accuracy nor steadiness. 
</P>
<P>
In the climax of the terminal scene, she clutched the freshly severed head of 
Jochanaan to her breast without besmirching her lily-white bodice with so much 
as a drop of blood. Even more disconcerting, she suggested that her lyric 
resources were too frail to compete with the lush, orgasmic utterances of the 
orchestra. Under the circumstances, it seemed compassionate as well as 
convenient for Lehnhoff to have her drop dead long before Herod, impotent and 
unattended, could order her execution. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Clark, Bayreuth's Mime, was the buffonesque Tetrarch. Mignon Dunn served 
as his blowsy bride. Bernd Weikl barked mightily as the bearded Baptist in the 
basement (when the technicians didn't turn off his sub-stage microphone). 
</P>
<P>
The top ticket for this performance cost $98. The house was not sold out.

'SANSEI': AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a loud noise coming from the Mark Taper Forum -- louder than any we can 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the noise is the Asian-American band Hiroshima. And the cause of 
it all is "Sansei," a musical-theatrical construct based on the lives of 
bandleader Dan Kuramoto, his ex-wife and koto player June Kuramoto, drummer 
Danny Yamamoto and taiko percussionist Johnny Mori. As the musicians perform, 
actors impersonating them step forward and talk to us cloaked in their new 
personas. 
</P>
<P>
This is another of the Taper's self- and socially conscious ventures into the 
tortuous mine field of commissioned sociodrama. Like its most obvious artistic 
predecessor, "Green Card," developed at the Taper in 1986 to explore the lives 
of Los Angeles' newest immigrants, "Sansei" is a pseudo-play. 
</P>
<P>
Verbally, it is a collage of monologues consisting of personal reminiscences, 
peppered with a few cultural gags and attempts at a sort of poetic social 
commentary addressed directly to the audience and redolent most with 
self-congratulation. Call it collective kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, unlike "Green Card," it's a terrific concert. 
</P>
<P>
Visually, "Sansei" also offers satisfactions. Mark Wedland has provided a 
handsome structural set of platforms and grids that come alive under Jeff 
Ravitz's kaleidoscopic lights (assisted, in the musical portions, by David E. 
Freeman). Between the set and the dancing lights (also used to focus our 
attention), there is at least one memorable image: that of Johnny Mori in 
traditional Japanese dress (Lydia Tanji designed the costumes) going at the 
taiko while Lane Nishikawa, portraying Johnny, tells us how he came to play the 
instrument and improvise it from wine barrels when he couldn't afford to import 
the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sansei," the program tells us, was "created" by the band members and 
"developed" by director Robert Egan. Where it departs from the presentational 
stasis of "Green Card" is in its integration of words and music and one other 
thing: While it is often a clumsy or entirely superficial effort, it does make 
a stab at living up to its title (Sansei means third generation 
Japanese-American) by illustrating the extraordinary mix of cultural influences 
that have shaped and will continue to shape the inhabitants of our new world. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it is not surprising that some of the other, newer Hiroshima band members 
bear names reflecting this ethnic mix: Dean Cortez, Kimo Cornwell, Allen Hinds 
and a lead singer named Machun. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Kuramoto (played by Marc Hayashi) is Sansei but grew up in East Los Angeles 
and extols the virtues of the burritos and taquitos at that end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
June (performed with some depth and great polish by Natsuko Ohama) grew up 
rebellious and in her efforts to assimilate tried to give up the koto; only a 
persistent teacher who regularly sought her out and dragged her to classes kept 
her on track. 
</P>
<P>
Nishikawa as Mori talks about discrimination in Utah, where he and a group of 
friends were denied service in a coffee shop because, by the blackest irony, 
they were mistaken for American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mashita as Yamamoto tells of his extreme isolation as a student at UCLA. 
None of them knows where Tule Lake might be, though all of them know it was the 
location of a wartime internment camp. To these third-generationists, their 
Japanese ancestry is at once immediate and remote. 
</P>
<P>
That must be why the band, which mixes the koto, shamisen and taiko with 
synthesizers, electric keyboards and guitars, is known chiefly for instrumental 
jazz with its roots firmly in black music. The result (including fine 
renditions of "Living in America" and "Thousand Cranes") is an exciting musical 
Big Mix, in a way the parallel theatrical format never touches: spontaneous and 
organic. 
</P>
<P>
For all its good intentions and its sporadic flare-ups of interest, "Sansei" 
remains a concert trying to "pass" as drama. Its content is super thin, the 
personal histories trivial or limited and, when a real issue comes along -- 
such as race discrimination in the recording industry, Dan and June's divorce 
or Dan's addiction to drugs -- they're all but passed over in a fast line or 
two, countered by a good deal of chatter about rebirth and self-assertion. 
</P>
<P>
To bring the spoken content of "Sansei" up to the level of the musical one 
would have taken far greater courage. There's plenty of intercultural nastiness 
festering out there in the real world. This could have been an opportunity to 
explore it. It would have taken another kind of gumption to look at things 
head-on, squarely and honestly. Instead, "Sansei" pays lip service to the 
problems and offers a happy Hollywood ending. 
</P>

After playing in the more modern Ford Auditorium in recent years, the Detroit 
Symphony Orchestra next season will move back to historic Orchestra Hall, which 
musicians call an acoustic gem. Orchestra Hall, built in 1919, was scheduled 
for demolition in 1970 -- to be replaced by a fast-food restaurant -- when 
enraged patrons mounted a campaign to save it. The restoration is not yet 
complete and will continue in phases over the next several years, but about $2 
million in renovations will be made to the hall before the orchestra starts its 
season on Sept. 21. The tune is not entirely upbeat in Detroit, however. The 
orchestra is hurting financially, and still trying to recover from a 12-week 
musicians strike late in 1987 that caused subscription losses, the 
organization's main source of earned revenue. ALEENE MacMINN

Rumors of marital problems aside, Amy Irving is flying in from London, where 
she is on a publicity tour for "Crossing Delancey," to honor husband Steven 
Spielberg at the Moving Picture Ball on April 1. Irving is one of a dozen stars 
who will take part in what the ball's organizers are mysteriously calling "an 
unusual journey into the world of Steven Spielberg." Other Spielberg friends to 
perform that night are John Candy, Sean Connery, Danny DeVito, Richard 
Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Goldie Hawn, Penny Marshall, Rhea Perlman, Patti 
Austin, and the man behind "Roger Rabbit's" voice, Charles Fleischer. ALEENE

Debbie Gibson's long-running No. 1 album, "Electric Youth," hasn't lost its 
charge. Its major contender for the No. 1 position on the Billboard magazine 
pop chart is the new Madonna album, "Like a Prayer," which is likely to debut 
on the chart next week. Incidentally, Madonna's single by the same name is 
going up the pop singles chart like a rocket. It's No. 11 after just three 
weeks. Vanessa Williams' single "Dreamin' " just jumped three places to No. 9 
-- her first Top 10 single. 
</P>
<P>
* "Everything" has been a roller-coaster album for the Bangles. A few months 
ago, it was written off as a flop. But hit singles have kept the 6-month-old 
album, which is up to No. 22, alive. Their "Eternal Flame" is the new No. 1 pop 
single.

The joint national boards of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American 
Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) have unanimously approved 
the early contract settlement reached last weekend with the Alliance of Motion 
Picture and Televisin Producers and the three television networks. Secret 
ballots will be mailed to members for ratification, with an April 28 return 
deadline. The contracts cover 102,000 film and prime-time television 
performers, and the settlement came two months before negotiations were to 
begin.

BEAUTY MEETS THE BEAST AGAIN AT TRIBUTE TO WRAY AND 'KONG' 
</P>

One of the most indelible images in the history of the movies is the giant 
gorilla scaling the Empire State Building while clutching Fay Wray in his 
immense fist at the climax of "King Kong." To see the 1933 film today is to 
realize how much fun the getting there really is -- especially now that "King 
Kong" has been restored to its original grandeur by Turner Entertainment. It 
will screen today through Sunday at the Nuart as part of a tribute to Wray, 
whose autobiography, "On the Other Hand," has just been published. 
</P>
<P>
"King Kong" is the screen's ultimate Beauty-and-the-Beast fable, and it endures 
through the power of an innocence that has all but vanished from the screen, 
and from our lives as well. The Kong-Wray relationship seethes with an implicit 
sexuality that seems free from calculation, a quality those who attempted a 
remake in the '70s could not hope to duplicate. There is no question that "King 
Kong" continues to disturb us on a level that resists articulation (but invites 
all manner of interpretation, including the comforting notion in the depths of 
the Depression that the forces of a modern technological society will 
eventually prevail). Offended by various Freudian-like analyses, Merian C. 
Cooper maintained to the end of his life that his film was "never intended to 
be anything but the best damn adventure picture ever made." 
</P>
<P>
The film was primarily the inspiration of Cooper, who wrote the original story 
with Edgar Wallace and who directed the film with Ernest B. Schoedsack. After 
an exposition-heavy opening, it proceeds with the pace and excitement of an old 
serial, with a cliffhanger finish to every sequence. Wray plays an unemployed 
New Yorker who faints into the arms of Robert Armstrong, a maker of jungle 
adventure films whose work has been criticized for its lack of "love interest." 
(Armstrong's breezy character seems an amalgam of Lowell Thomas and Frank 
"Bring 'Em Back Alive" Buck.) In a flash, Wray is off to the East Indies with 
Armstrong and Bruce Cabot, a first mate who insists that a ship is no place for 
a woman but who, of course, swiftly falls for Wray. 
</P>
<P>
Producer David O. Selznick's grand manner emerges in the expedition's discovery 
of an uncharted, mysteriously walled-off island and in the appearance of Kong 
and various dinosaurs, the justly celebrated creations of Willis O'Brien, whose 
work may seem primitive in the age of Spielberg but whose effects seem 
perfectly attuned to the elementary nature of the film. 
</P>
<P>
When "King Kong" was rereleased in 1938, the Production Code Administration, 
which established severe new restrictions in 1934, demanded a number of cuts. 
By the late '50s, they had been restored to the film but they were grainy 
blowups of 16-millimeter footage. These inserts have now been replaced by 
35-millimeter footage provided to Turner Entertainment by a film collector in 
exchange for a print of a 300-foot color sequence in the 1925 "Phantom of the 
Opera." As might be expected, one of the censored portions showed Kong 
shredding Wray's clothes, but the others depicted Kong's ferocious destruction 
of a number of humans who had the misfortune to get in his way. These sequences 
are tame by today's standards, and they intensify by contrast the poignancy of 
Kong's tender feelings for Wray. 
</P>
<P>
Wray will speak after the 7:30 Saturday showing of "King Kong." On Friday the 
film will be accompanied by "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933); on Saturday by 
"The Most Dangerous Game" (1932) and on Sunday by "Doctor X" (1932). Wray was 
the leading lady in all three. The first and the third are elegant (if hokey) 
horror pictures, directed by Michael Curtiz and fine examples of early color; 
the second is remembered fondly by Wray in her memoirs. Screening schedule:

Post-Modern architecture meets old Op art in the work of Allen Harrison. He 
makes painted wood wall reliefs. His characteristic format is a stepped pyramid 
shape put together with blocks of wood. They jut back and forth from the 
surface. Works are then painted with areas that look like stacks of chromatic 
paint cards which recede and advance like some illusionistic computer graphic. 
Some simpler formats look like an updating of the shiny '60s planks of John 
McCracken. Harrison's work is timely and fun to see -- a kind of visual 
xylophone -- but its appeal is almost entirely to the rational side of the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers will remember James Murray as a local Photo-Realist back in the 
'70s. He re-emerges with about 20 handsome landscape drawings in rich, sooty 
charcoal. One grandiose beach sunset has the bravura of Albert Bierstadt's work 
and the whole is as romantic as Caspar David Friedrich. Formats are long and 
horizons low, so great skies dominate. All works are untitled but waft with 
strong suspicions of L.A. terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Squeezing panoramic scale into small spaces gives the black drawings an 
intimacy that has a wonderful visionary edge like the work of Marvin Harden or 
Vija Celmins. Smoke belching from huge chimneys of refineries is dwarfed by 
nature's clouds. Nightscapes dotted with city lights see the insignificance of 
humankind's great power plants and yet know we are poisoning the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The work is too poetic for mere social criticism. An image of an unfinished 
freeway and a metal cage as tall as a royal palm speak of failed utopias and 
lost Edens. Murray has found rich territory. (Tortue Gallery, 2917 Santa Monica 
Blvd., to April 27.) WILLIAM WILSON

Bay Area veteran Tom Holland turns up with a substantial show of some 20 large 
abstract paintings. In characteristic fashion, some hang on the wall while 
others in plexiglass and aluminum formats are bent into three dimensions and 
stand about, looking very much like sculpture. An impressive job called "Mann" 
hangs from the ceiling like a giant mobile. We think of Frank Stella as the 
artist who exploded painting into 3-D but -- if memory serves -- Holland was 
there first, grommeting away. 
</P>
<P>
Although lacking the high profile reputation of some of his peers, Holland is 
an established talent who pursues his star steadily if sometimes unevenly. The 
look of present work is slightly troubled and Neo-Expressionist. Formats 
incline to dark, fuming Cubist envelopes shot through with wedges and shafts of 
limpid color applied with frustrated tenacity. Their scrubby appearance is the 
natural result of forcing paint onto resistant metal and plastic surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
If these works could be played on a musical instrument, it would have to be an 
organ with rich bass sonorities and flute-y high notes. The paintings are big 
and Baroque, but if they have a theme it might be "What ever happened to the 
good old days?" A painting on an oval format ruminates on the great moment of 
Analytic Cubism in Paris. There are whiffs of Delaunay's Orphism in Holland's 
symphonic color and of Constructivism in the way he puts it all together. 
</P>
<P>
Thoughts of his own salad days in the '60s recall an artist like Ron Davis. 
Mostly, however, the brooding, nostalgic character of the work ties Holland to 
his own Bay Area tradition, its beginnings in visiting Abstract Expressionists 
and its culmination in Richard Diebenkorn. To his credit, Holland rarely lapses 
into eccentricity but fights the good fight for Serious Painting. As it has 
been making a comeback of late, he seems to be winning. (James Corcoran 
Gallery, 1327 5th St., to April 15.) WILLIAM WILSON

Comic strip cesspools, used as metaphors for humiliation, and tattered 
crocheted toys that whittle away at society's sexual role playing make up the 
recent handiwork of artist Mike Kelley. Weird yet amazingly familiar, his 
drawings and objects nag at the human conscience by using things from everyday 
life rather than the realm of high art. In his hands, the Sunday funnies and 
all the stuff grandma ever knitted the kids for Christmas become part of a 
larger narrative. It's a raucous conversation packing a truck load of 
disappointment in the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley clothes his moral dissatisfaction in an irreverent Benny Hill attitude 
that takes aim at all sorts of structures of supposed superiority. Even the 
whitened sanctuary of the gallery is not immune. This exhibit is hip deep in 
thrift shop bargains. The floors and walls are littered with used, handmade 
stuffed toys roughly sewn and bound together in a "Manly Craft" parody of the 
womanly arts. The brutality of the gesture forcibly confronts social attitudes 
towards masculinity, craft, play and sex. In Kelley's art every hand-stitched 
memento comes with an emotional edge of controlled violence rather than 
romantic nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley's hokey, tattered materials return art to the immediacy of the real 
world just as the cartoon drawing's irreverence uses art to question the value 
of human life and the nature of dignity. Part of the enjoyment of his work is 
that it deals so intelligently with vital issues of ethics and morality -- even 
if they do come wrapped in a Hefty cinch sack like a muttering street person.

In his first American exhibition Korean sculptor Jung Yong Chaing shows the 
human figure, nude and unadorned, dancing against the cutting restraint of a 
tightly wound cord. The small and beautifully proportioned female bodies cast 
in bronze are reminiscent of Robert Graham's idealized nudes, but Chaing's 
figures are more animated and alive. Figures such as "Dancing" don't so much 
appear to balance on one foot as they seem to be doing a swift jig, gesturing 
with graceful fingers like Siva Nataraja, the Indian image of life as a dance 
in time and space. 
</P>
<P>
While figures move in fleshy vibrancy against the tightness of a slim cord, 
Chaing's solitary head sculptures are too often cold and studied. Instead of 
exuding life, they seem to merely describe an emotion and lack the vitality of 
the complete figures. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the oil-on-linen still-life paintings of Roger Campbell are cool, 
spartan arrangements of small household appliances juxtaposed with single 
fruits or vegetables in a window niche. These contemporary genre paintings 
lovingly catch the bright flatness of California light at different times of 
day. This subtle passage of time, marked off by faint color changes on a wall 
just outside the window, unites the dissimilar man-made and natural props. It's 
a delightful subtlety that would be welcome in paintings such as the heavily 
symbolic image of containment, "For the Roid." (Koplin Gallery, 8225 1/2 Santa 
Monica Blvd., to April 15.) SUVAN GEER

CD CORNER: WELK GROUP EXPANDS BLUES CATALOGUE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Because of its success with such artists as Joan Baez and the Weavers, Vanguard 
Records has been widely regarded as chiefly a folk music label. However, the 
company also has an impressive blues catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
The Welk Record Group, which purchased Vanguard in 1986, emphasizes that side 
of the company's history with the recent release of five blues-related CDs. The 
albums are appearing in compact disc for the first time and most haven't been 
available in vinyl for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The "Great Bluesmen/Newport," a 71-minute collection drawn from Newport Folk 
Festivals between 1959 and 1965, features tracks by Robert Pete Williams, Sonny 
Terry and Brownie McGhee, John Lee Hooker, Rev. Gary Davis and Mississippi Fred 
McDowell. Originally released in vinyl as a double album, it is now in a single 
CD (or cassette) at regular prices. To make it fit on a single CD, some music 
from the original Vanguard album was deleted. 
</P>
<P>
The four other blues packages are all in the Vanguard Midline CD series and 
should retail for around $11. They are Skip James' "Today," Junior Wells and 
Buddy Guy's "Coming at You," James Cotton's "Cut You Loose" and Mississippi 
John Hurt's "Last Sessions." 
</P>
<P>
On the folk side, Vanguard has just added six catalogue albums to the Midline 
CD series: Country Joe McDonald's "Thinking of Woody Guthrie," Cisco Houston's 
"Sings Woody Guthrie," "The Weavers at Carnegie Hall, Vol. 2," the Weavers' 
"Almanac," Liam Clancy's "Liam Clancy" and "The Best of John Herald and the 
Greenbriar Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The new titles bring to 36 the number of blues and folk titles in the Midline 
CD series and to 31 the number in the "twofer" packages. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Crawford, vice president and director of sales and marketing for the Santa 
Monica-based Welk Record Group, said Volume II of the "Great Bluesmen/Newport," 
featuring mostly unreleased material, is due later this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Crawford said Samuel Charters, author of the widely acclaimed 
""The Country Blues," is designing some CD-only folk compilations, including 
some unreleased material. And due early next year: a three-disc Joan Baez 
anthology box along the lines of Bob Dylan's "Biograph."

Ah, the good ole days. That's what this 40-minute video is all about -- the 
President playfully snaring balloons on the convention stage, "Ron for King" 
pickets waving in the audience, "Ronnie" telling jokes about farmers and 
Russian peasants and how old he is: He quotes George Washington, but "I didn't 
actually hear him say it"; "When I go in for my physical, they don't ask my 
age; they just carbon date me." This is a collection of the nicer moments of 
his stand-up career. Whatever your politics, this guy scored with a joke.

***** "Early Summer" 
</P>
<P>
Sony. $59.95. 
</P>
<P>
Shot two years after his masterpiece, "Late Spring" (1949) -- and, like it, a 
winner of the Kinema Jumpo "Best Film" poll -- Yasujiro Ozu's drama of a family 
in flux, and the elaborate machinations around the betrothal of their eldest 
daughter, is very much a variation on a theme. Once again, Setsuko Hara must be 
pushed out of the nest to marry. Once again Chishu Ryu does the pushing. Once 
again we get a bittersweet sense of loss: the marriage dubious, the family 
forever disrupted. Once again, Ozu's script, co-written with constant colleague 
Kogo Noda, is a marvel of organic detail and deceptive naturalism. Ozu's late 
style -- the serene, easy flow, the smooth succession of floor-level interior 
shots, the quietly restrained acting, the mastery of intimate psychology and 
the subtle portrayal of Japanese society in transition -- are all in place. 
Newcomers to his work, however, may be mystified; they should start with "Late 
Spring" or "Tokyo Story."

This week's big video release is "Big" (CBS/Fox, $89.95, PG). Following by a 
week the video release of another Tom Hanks picture, "Punchline," this 
comedy-fantasy is about a boy who wishes himself into adulthood, carrying his 
pubescent mind along for the wild ride. "Funny, warm, sophisticated and highly 
imaginative," wrote Kevin Thomas in The Times. Also highly successful, with a 
$111 million box-office gross. 
</P>
<P>
Many fans of director Costa-Gavras felt betrayed by "Betrayed" (MGM/UA, $89.95, 
R) -- or at least disappointed. This time his political interests centered on 
white supremacists in America's heartland, as conveyed in a script by Joe 
Eszterhas ("Flashdance"). "The result," wrote Sheila Benson in The Times, "is a 
loosening of the trademark Costa-Gavras tension," though she found Debra 
Winger's performance as an FBI agent "warm" and "believable." 
</P>
<P>
Federico Fellini's first two films, "Variety Lights" (co-directed by Alberto 
Lattuada) and "The White Sheik" are being released this week, after 
rescheduling, by Connoisseur Video for $59.95 each. The same company also has 
Michelangelo Antonioni's "The Eclipse" and Kaneto Shindo's "Onibaba" for $79.95 
each. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated's swimsuit video isn't the only one. "The Fashion Report 
Swimsuit Edition" (Twin Tower, $14.95) is a 45-minute tape hyped as "the new 
swimsuit video that even women can enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
Body and mind come into play in "Positively Yoga" (Hay House, $24.95, 62 
minutes). Information: (213) 394-7445. TERRY ATKINSON

MOVABLE FEASTS: SAVORING THE STUFF AT SAVORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Savories. That's the name of a new take-out shop/cafe on Beverly Drive. At 
first, I imagined a store filled with fussy tinned things, finnan haddie 
(that's smoked haddock from Scotland) and olives as varied and briny as they 
come. Was I ever wrong. The goods here are freshly made and scrupulously 
undersalted, with an allegiance, in fact, to things not savory but sweet. "Eat 
dessert first, life is uncertain." That's what the sign on the counter says. 
</P>
<P>
People in the Savories neighborhood already pile in for jumbo-sized hot, fresh 
muffins, with flavors (blueberry, corn and Cheddar, something 
chocolater-than-thou) that change daily. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling that life's uncertain? Savories' wet, nutty fudge-like brownies would 
be a steadfast way to blast through space. (Yes, dessert's coming first today.) 
</P>
<P>
The buttery, thick bread pudding ($5.99 per pound) with vats of hard sauce is 
completely satisfying (the gentleman serving us kept spooning the topping on . 
. . ). 
</P>
<P>
A good measure of the Nourishing Food is equally pleasing. I know that the 
exquisite curried chicken salad ($9.50 per pound), with its fat raisins, mango 
chutney, toasted almonds and lushly coated chicken, is halfway to dessert, but, 
really, it's one of the best in its class. The lean honey-mustard boneless 
grilled chicken breast ($8.99 per pound) tastes of wood cooking, and is totally 
luscious. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertain life that this is, of course, not everything turned out to be equally 
mesmerizing. The black bean salad was refined and distinct with a swell little 
kick of cumin, ($6.50 per pound). The Mexican chicken salad, all mashed up, was 
muddy and confused. The Greek salad with lots of fresh oregano and a pleasing, 
creamy feta ($6.50 per pound) was very light while the wild rice, pine nut and 
pepper salad was absolutely indistinct. Sesame noodles were underflavored, 
raddiatore with a frothy pesto ($7.99 per pound) were more assertive and fun to 
eat. Green bean salad was lethargic, penne with "tomato pesto" was boring, but 
the spinach lasagna was lusty, fluffy and reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in the mood for exotica, Savories sells Tuscan biscuits, honey dashed 
with whiskey, and shelves full of other upscale delicacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Savories, 240 South Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. (213) 276-9481. Open 
Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Saturday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Closed Sundays. MasterCard 
and Visa. Street parking.

A SEA-CHANGE AT GULLIVER'S IN MARINA DEL REY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's obvious now that Gulliver's was all wrong for Marina del Rey. Flagons of 
ale, serving wenches, the beef of Olde England -- pshaw! A boaty seafood 
restaurant, that's what the Marina really wanted all along. 
</P>
<P>
So the old Gulliver's has been metamorphosed into Marinela -- stripped and 
sanded and put through a total sea-change so that the wood no longer looks dark 
and clubby but sun-bleached and salt-pitted. The ceiling is now full of 
bright-colored catamaran sails and the effect is quite boaty indeed. In fact, 
the decks can get pretty crowded on a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Avast the hearty trencherman motif; Marinela is for oceanic grazing. There are 
only six steaks and chops against a couple of dozen seafood entrees, to say 
nothing of 50-odd appetizers and salads. The owner is also the proprietor of 
the Bicycle Cafe, so we can expect a degree of eclecticism: the odd dash of 
curry, salmon with dill here and there, a New England clam chowder. Mostly, 
though, the food is Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
And altogether it's pretty lively -- things like charred swordfish with lime 
butter, or an appetizer of scampi grilled until they get an almond-like flavor, 
served on three-colored pasta. It must be said that Marinela does sometimes go 
overboard on pasta. The well-cooked osso buco (oddly topped with orange peel 
instead of lemon peel) comes with linguine instead of rice, practically 
impossible to eat with the wide-tined fork and the thin sauce. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Marinela announced it would be a Basque restaurant. All that's 
left of that idea, apparently, is a simple dish of chicken stewed with 
tomatoes, peppers and strong-flavored, paper-thin slices of Basque ham, and a 
fish chowder called thoro (often spelled ttoro, and correctly pronounced 
something like "choro" in Basque). However you spell it, thoro is a winner, 
thickened with toasted bread crumbs and strongly dosed with saffron. 
</P>
<P>
Saffron, in fact, is a dominating note here. There's a wonderful appetizer of 
poached oysters flavored with saffron and aniseed and topped with a buttery 
froth. There are mushrooms stuffed with crab in a surprisingly serious crab 
sauce (more saffron), and very acceptable paella with chicken, mussels, clams 
and saffron. Of course there's bouillabaisse, consisting mostly of shellfish in 
this case, with a lot of saffron and Pernod. 
</P>
<P>
The small onion tart on the appetizer list is a little odd, a puff pastry shell 
filled with threads of onion that have been fried dark brown in oil and topped 
with some black olives. It's savory but rather oily, and really more like an 
overgrown canape than an onion tart. The only real clinker I've found here, 
though, was a shrimp cocktail with shamefully mushy prawns. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert there are a lot of ice creams in such concoctions as a mocha and 
hazelnut coupe, but mostly it's a big pastry selection. The most distinctive 
are a warm apple tart (made with ordinary apple slices rather than the usual 
paper-thin ones) and an elaborate strawberry shortcake, more or less a frosted 
cake with whole strawberries in the filling. 
</P>
<P>
So it's the end of a beef-oriented era at this location. Those sounds you hear 
are the clatter of mussels in sauce poulette and the crunch of calamari. And 
the creaking of the yardarm and the keening of the gale, too, I suppose. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinela, 13181 Mindanao Way, Marina del Rey. (213) 821-8866. Open for lunch 
and dinner daily. Full bar. Parking lot. American Express, Diners Club, 
MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $41 to $73.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: ROARING WITH LAUGHTER AT POMODORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The morning after my dinner at Pomodoro, 133 N. La Cienega, Beverly Hills, 
(213) 652-7666, my dining companion called to tell me that he couldn't remember 
when he'd had more fun. 
</P>
<P>
This is not, you understand, because the meal had been so wonderful. I think 
the giggles started when we discovered that "aragosta e fagioli" is translated 
on the menu as "lobster and white clam salad" (fagioli are white beans). Then 
the bread turned out to be remarkably hard (considering that the restaurant had 
only been open two days), the waitress had never opened a bottle of wine 
before, and the waiter appeared with a dish of veal asking, "Who gets the 
chicken?" When the waiter walked over with a plate of pasta, insisting that it 
was the antipasto I had ordered, we began roaring with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
You might expect a really rough opening from an inexperienced restaurateur. But 
Pomodoro is owned by the Ruggeri family, who run the famous Bices in Milan, 
Sardinia and New York. They have spent a lot on their debut in Los Angeles, 
bringing in famous designer Adam Tihany to redo the old Bistango, and hiring 
big publicity guns. 
</P>
<P>
It will undoubtedly improve. Meanwhile, eat a little designer pizza, sip some 
San Pellegrino, have an espresso, some gelato -- and enjoy yourself.RUTH REICHL

350 ARRESTED FOR ABORTION PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
OPERATION RESCUE, PRO-CHOICE GROUPS IN ANGRY ORANGE COUNTY FACE-OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Militant anti-abortionists and a coalition of pro-choice demonstrators 
converged by the hundreds on an Orange County family planning clinic Thursday, 
engaging in an angry confrontation to determine whether pregnant women could 
make their way inside. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes after the clinic in Cypress was supposed to open, scores of 
police stepped in and began arresting hundreds of members of Operation Rescue, 
from churches here and around the country, who are seeking to create havoc at 
Southland abortion clinics during Holy Week. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said 350 members of the group were arrested for blockading the 
offices of the Family Planning Associates medical group, as was one 
counter-demonstrator. 
</P>
<P>
The chaotic but largely peaceful struggle, planned for months and carefully 
choreographed by both sides, was expected to be but the first of a series of 
similar clashes at Southern California clinics through Easter eve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Protesters Expected 
</P>
<P>
After the Thursday morning clash, the Operation Rescue people expressed some 
dismay that more protesters did not take part in the initial skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
"My disappointment is that this represents only a fraction of the membership of 
some larger churches in this area," Joseph Foreman, national field director for 
Operation Rescue, said as he watched the day's events. "This place (the clinic) 
does not have to exist." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Martinez, a member of the National Organization for Women, said, 
"Operation Rescue didn't accomplish anything today in terms of stopping women 
from exercising the right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
More than two dozen clients eventually were able to get into the clinic with 
the help of pro-choice escorts wearing orange-colored vests, but not before 
Operation Rescue "sidewalk counselors" showed them photographs of fetuses and 
called out, "Save your baby!" or "Don't kill your baby . . . This is murder!" 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortionists sang "Amazing Grace" and "Jesus Loves the Little 
Children" while refusing to move from doorways. They went limp as Cypress 
police hauled them off one by one to be cited and released. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteers Chant 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pro-choice volunteers chanted, "My body's nobody's body but mine" 
and told police, "Read 'em their rights and take 'em away." 
</P>
<P>
Some patients who were not immediately able to get through the demonstrators 
were given temporary shelter in a small business school across the street until 
police and pro-choice escorts could get them into the clinic through a side 
door. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, anti-abortion protesters descended on the car of a young couple, 
plastering the windshield with pictures of dead babies. The woman put her head 
down on the steering wheel and appeared to be crying. A dog in the car began 
barking wildly. 
</P>
<P>
When protesters refused to leave the couple alone, the angry man began pushing 
one of them. Finally, the woman persuaded him to get back into the car and they 
drove away. She shouted out the window, "You people have no right to do this!" 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old girl who was seeking an abortion decided to go to another clinic 
rather than face the crowd and the cameras because she was afraid her parents 
would see her picture. "The poor little girl was scared to death," said 
Katherine Cammack, executive director of Barclay College, the business school. 
</P>
<P>
The New-York based Operation Rescue had promised to gather thousands of 
anti-abortion activists for the Southern California effort, envisioned as one 
of its most ambitious in a series of similar protests held across the country 
since a debut last summer at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice groups have marshalled hundreds of their own people in a bid to beat 
the Operation Rescue forces to secretly targeted clinics, and thus prevent the 
anti-abortion forces from blockading the doors. 
</P>
<P>
Although there had been claims that more than 2,000 people from throughout the 
country would come here to take part in the crusade to shut down Southern 
California abortion clinics, Operation Rescue official Ken Tanner estimated 
that about 85% of Thursday's sit-in participants were from Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look Toward Saturday 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue officials had predicted that 3,500 would participate during 
the three days. On Thursday, however, Tanner said he expected a total of 2,000, 
and said Saturday should be the biggest day. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue claims to have had 20,000 people arrested at anti-abortion 
sit-ins throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles area "Holy Week of Rescue" was organized to bring attention to 
the U.S. Supreme Court's impending reconsideration of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 
case that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
A federal court last week issued an injunction prohibiting the demonstrators 
from placing themselves within 15 feet of a clinic doorway. Operation Rescue 
members declared their intention to violate that order -- and were as good as 
their word. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Police Lt. John T. Schaefer estimated that more than 600 
anti-abortionists joined the demonstration at the clinic while about 150 
pro-choice advocates showed up to counter them. Estimates by some reporters 
were lower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
70 Officers Assist 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, 70 officers from seven jurisdictions, including the Orange County 
Sheriffs' Department, were on hand to make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Although rumors persisted that clinics in Los Angeles and elsewhere were about 
to be hit with demonstrations, and as pro-choice groups waited at scattered 
locations to respond, the Cypress sit-in was the day's main event. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief Robert L. Vernon of Los Angeles, after meeting with 
about a dozen top officers at the department's Emergency Command Center, said 
Thursday afternoon that he was sure that the Operation Rescue demonstrators 
would turn their attention to Los Angeles either today or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"My best guess is the biggest demonstration will be on Saturday," Vernon said. 
"It's the biggest business day for some of the clinics." 
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the Police Department will be ready either day and added, "We 
will respect rights, but we won't put up with any foolishness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leader Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested Thursday was Randall Terry, the 29-year-old founder of 
Operation Rescue from Binghamton, N.Y., who was exhorting his followers through 
a bullhorn to slow down the arrest process by refusing to tell police anything 
until given permission by the campaign leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Like the others, he was holding a psalm book and went limp as five officers 
carried him to a police van. He lay on the passenger seat murmuring "Holy 
Jesus" while his supporters chanted, "Justice, justice, justice!" 
</P>
<P>
Police took most of those arrested to nearby Cypress City Hall where they 
quickly overflowed the City Council Chamber and had to be moved to the Cypress 
Community Center tennis courts for processing. 
</P>
<P>
They were cited for remaining at the scene of an unlawful assembly, a 
misdemeanor, and were released after being given dates in late April to report 
to West Orange County Municipal Court in Westminster for arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
The first to be released on her own recognizance was Aleta Matthews of 
Torrance, who said she intends to appear for her arraignment on April 26. "I 
wouldn't miss it," she said. Arrested about 9:30 a.m. and released early in the 
afternoon, she pronounced the experience "absolutely worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Others said after they were released that during the several hours they 
remained on the tennis courts, they prayed and listened to short sermons by the 
12 to 15 ministers who were among them. But it was about 1 p.m. before portable 
toilets were brought in, one person said, and there was some anxiety because 
police had advised people to drink water so the sun would not make them ill. 
</P>
<P>
The location of the demonstration was kept secret by Operation Rescue leaders 
until all of the participants were ready in cars and vans to depart from the 
Melodyland parking lot in Anaheim before sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the group departed in one caravan for the clinic at 9461 Grindlay 
Street in Cypress, while the others -- referred to by the leaders as the "Delta 
Force" -- awaited further instructions. They, too, were dispatched to the 
clinic to sit in doorways. 
</P>
<P>
Some pro-choice people -- part of a coalition including Planned Parenthood, the 
American Civil Liberties Union, NOW and the California Abortion Rights Action 
League -- reached the clinic ahead of the first Operation Rescue wave. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, there were alternate layers of demonstrators: anti-abortion 
protesters in Operation Rescue T-shirts and pro-choice supporters in orange 
"Escort" vests and purple armbands. They carried blue-and-white signs reading 
"Keep Abortion Legal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Each Other Ill 
</P>
<P>
The two sides almost seemed intent on making each other ill. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
Sue Coorey, 33, a member of a Pentecostal church in Agua Dulce, held a poster 
showing the bloody, severed head of a fetus. A foot away, Anthony Herick, 20, a 
Harvey Mudd College engineering major, waved a placard bearing the photograph 
of a bloody nude woman he said had died after a botched abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress police warned demonstrators that they were participating in an unlawful 
assembly and that they would be arrested if they refused to move from the 
doorways. Most pro-choice people moved away, but anti-abortionists remained 
where they were. 
</P>
<P>
As officers waded in to carry them off one by one, the protesters went limp. 
And, as instructed by their leaders, others crawled in to take the places of 
those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, whose car was surrounded by "sidewalk counselors" as she entered the 
two-story office building, said later: "I don't know why everybody assumes 
you're there for an abortion. It's nobody's business why I was there. I could 
have been there to go to the dentist." 
</P>
<P>
As the last of those arrested were released Thursday afternoon, Operation 
Rescue leaders called it a day and repaired to Anaheim for another nighttime 
rally at Melodyland where, one of them said, they would "prepare spiritually 
for future protests."

BIPARTISAN U.S. ACCORD REACHED ON NICARAGUA; 
</P>
<P>
OUTLINE CALLS FOR BUSH TO SEEK PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN EXCHANGE FOR OK OF 
NON-LETHAL CONTRA AID

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration and leaders of both parties in Congress reached 
agreement Thursday on the outline of a bipartisan policy on Nicaragua, the 
first such consensus in almost a decade of U.S. attempts to deal with the 
Sandinista revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, hammered out in two weeks of hard bargaining on Capitol 
Hill, Congress will approve a 10-month renewal of non-military aid for the 
Contras who have been fighting to overthrow the leftist government, 
Administration officials and members of Congress said. 
</P>
<P>
In return, they said, the Administration will commit itself to pursuing a 
peaceful, political solution to the Central American conflict, with the 
eventual goal of returning the Contras to civilian life in a more democratic 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III were still calling 
Republican senators Thursday evening, trying to win their agreement to the 
final version of the plan, aides said. A senior Administration official warned 
that the pact "could still come unglued" because of remaining opposition from 
both hard-line liberals and conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
But barring any last-minute hitches, White House officials said, Bush plans to 
announce the bipartisan pact after a meeting with congressional leaders this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"The point of this plan is to end the era in which Nicaragua was a contentious, 
divisive issue and to produce a policy which will clearly be United States 
policy -- not just the Administration's policy or the Democrats' policy," a 
State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping the Contras in place as a viable military force, which is a 
pressure point against the Sandinistas. . . . And now the Administration can 
begin to do its job, which is to use diplomatic pressure to bring democracy to 
Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement appeared to be a victory for both Baker, who devised and 
negotiated the pact, and House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), who delivered the 
support of a majority of House Democrats by holding out for a key amendment: a 
clause that allows Congress to halt aid to the Contras if it decides that the 
Administration is not pursuing a peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The willingness of both sides to seek a consensus represents a major shift. The 
Reagan Administration had doggedly sought military aid for the Contras and 
showed little taste for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we are united, we succeed in foreign policy, and where we're divided, we 
fail," Baker said earlier this week. "We've been divided on Central America; 
it's been a very emotional and divisive issue for eight to 10 years. I think 
that before we can anticipate success in the region, we're going to have to get 
our act together up here . . . and pursue a unified approach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Baker Is Sincere' 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Jim Baker is sincere," Wright said in an interview Wednesday, before 
the agreement was reached. ". . . Essentially, what has to be done is to give 
our colleagues (in Congress) an adequate assurance that our commitment is to 
the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement sets out a two-page statement of U.S. policies and objectives in 
Central America and pledges the Administration and both parties in Congress to 
work for their fulfillment, officials said. Its main provisions are that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The United States will support the peace process already launched by the 
presidents of the five Central American nations to reach negotiated solutions 
to the region's internal conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The United States will continue to press for full democracy in Nicaragua, 
including free and fair elections in February of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the same time, Congress will approve renewed non-military aid for the 
Contras for the 10 months beginning May 1, to maintain the rebels as a 
potential threat until the elections are held. The aid will be provided "at 
existing levels," meaning about $5.2 million a month, according to 
Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In return, the Administration will ensure that the Contras do not receive 
secret military aid and do not engage in offensive military action against the 
Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As democracy is achieved in Nicaragua, the United States will support the 
voluntary demobilization of the Contras and their reintegration into Nicaragua 
or relocation elsewhere in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The United States will also work to protect its own security interests in 
Central America, and will negotiate directly with the Soviet Union to reduce 
Soviet aid to Cuba and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Active Role Seen 
</P>
<P>
Once the new, bipartisan policy is announced, the Administration is expected to 
take a more active role in the Central American diplomatic process than before, 
officials said. Among several actions under consideration, they said, Bush may 
name a special envoy to the region and Baker may visit the four U.S. allies 
there -- El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica -- as early as next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Among their aims, they said, will be to focus attention on Nicaragua's internal 
political system so that the Sandinistas' movement toward democracy, or their 
lack of movement, becomes the main issue in the area's diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal, at least on paper, is a free election in Nicaragua next 
February, and a political situation in which the Contras voluntarily disband. 
But senior Administration officials acknowledge that they are still skeptical 
that the Sandinistas are willing to meet U.S. demands for more democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't performed yet, have they?" asked one. 
</P>
<P>
If diplomacy fails, Administration officials say that they reserve the right to 
ask Congress for military aid for the Contras to restart Nicaragua's guerrilla 
war. But Wright and other Democrats adamantly insist that they will never agree 
to renewed military aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pact Marks 1st Success 
</P>
<P>
If the bipartisan pact on Central America holds up, even if only on Capitol 
Hill -- it will be the Bush Administration's first solid foreign policy 
success. Bush and Baker sought the unusual policy agreement, aides said, 
because both are convinced that the Administration's success in foreign affairs 
depends directly on the breadth of bipartisan support it can command. 
</P>
<P>
Within the first weeks after Bush's election last November, Baker met with 
Wright in a long session to seek bipartisan cooperation. The meeting, at the 
apartment of former Democratic Party Chairman Robert S. Strauss, quickly turned 
to the thorny problem of Nicaragua, according to a source who was present. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after Inauguration Day, Baker told his new aides at the State Department 
that a bipartisan agreement on Nicaragua was one of his first priorities. 
</P>
<P>
On March 2, Baker quietly unveiled his proposal in meetings with Senate 
Republican leaders -- and, again, with Wright. A senior Administration official 
told reporters that the goal of U.S. policy in Nicaragua has shifted from 
overthrowing the Sandinistas to merely "containing" them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feverish Negotiations 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Baker's plan won remarkable support from both Democratic and 
Republican congressional leaders, weary of the long battles over Nicaragua 
policy. But last week, resistance to the plan increased among both liberal 
Democrats and conservative Republicans, prompting Baker to launch a feverish 
round of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptical Democrats, led by Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), complained that they 
were being asked to give the Administration a blank check. "I am simply looking 
for an escape hatch" if things go wrong, Obey said. 
</P>
<P>
His "escape hatch" turned out to be an amendment to the plan that Baker 
accepted on Thursday. Under the amendment, the Administration can provide the 
Contras with aid from May through November but must seek the approval of 
congressional leaders before releasing any aid after that. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, officials said, some conservative Republicans complained that 
the plan went too far toward endorsing the goal of disbanding the Contras. The 
peace plan approved last month by the Central American presidents calls for 
dismantling the rebel army, but Administration officials contend that Nicaragua 
must achieve internal democracy first. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the conservatives were unhappy with the language (in Baker's plan) 
about relocation" of the Contras, one Administration official said. He said 
that Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) had expressed 
reservations about that provision. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, officials said, Baker won the approval of the liberal House 
Democratic leadership before he was able to tie down the approval of his own 
conservative allies.

HOUSE, DEFYING VETO THREATS, OKS WAGE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The House, defying threats of a presidential veto, voted Thursday to raise the 
federal minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by late 1991, 30 cents higher 
than President Bush has said he would accept. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders said that the vote, 248 to 171, is likely to spur the 
Senate into approving an even higher minimum wage -- possibly $4.65 an hour, as 
Senate Democrats have proposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs 'Training' Pay 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the vote is substantially short of the two-thirds' majority that 
would be needed to override a veto. And the House bill would allow a subminimum 
"training" wage -- 85% of the prevailing minimum wage -- only for a worker's 
first two months on a job, less than the six months sought by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's position is firm . . . " Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said 
Thursday. "We're hanging tough." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee and the chief sponsor of the Senate bill, held out the 
possibility that the Democrats might be open to further bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
He urged Bush to "refrain from further veto threats until he sees the shape of 
the bill that Congress finally sends him. This is an excellent opportunity for 
Congress and the Administration to demonstrate that they can work together." 
</P>
<P>
The $4.55-an-hour figure voted by the House was billed as a bipartisan 
compromise. The House Education and Labor Committee originally had sought $4.65 
but agreed to a 10-cent reduction to halt defections by conservative Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The House rejected, 218 to 198, the Administration's $4.25-an-hour proposal. 
Before finally approving the bill, House members voted, 240 to 179, to approve 
the $4.55 figure. 
</P>
<P>
On final passage, 226 Democrats and 22 Republicans voted for the measure, while 
147 Republicans and 24 Democrats opposed it. The California delegation 
essentially split along party lines, with two exceptions: Rep. Charles Pashayan 
Jr. (R-Fresno) voted for the compromise bill, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over how much to increase the federal minimum wage is mainly a 
political one. Economists say that the economic impact of a higher minimum wage 
is likely to be modest because labor is already in such short supply that few 
jobs are still paying the federal minimum. 
</P>
<P>
And in some states -- such as California, where the minimum is $4.25 -- state 
law already provides for a higher wage than federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the issue has become a major rallying point for Democrats and 
organized labor. The federal minimum wage has not been increased since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), urging House approval of the 
compromise proposal, told lawmakers that "it isn't enough, but it certainly is 
better than nothing. I'm asking you for this vote today . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Bush has insisted on including a so-called "training" wage for new workers on 
grounds that employers might cut back on hiring if they are forced to pay a 
higher minimum wage to inexperienced workers. He wants the training wage to be 
today's $3.35-an-hour minimum. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing only a 60-day training period, the House-passed bill 
would apply the training minimum only to new workers with no experience. 
</P>
<P>
The full minimum wage would rise to $3.85 an hour on Oct. 1, $4.25 a year later 
and $4.55 in October of 1991 -- a year before Bush's proposed $4.25 would go 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise measure would also increase the number of businesses that are 
exempt from having to pay the federal minimum wage. Currently, employers whose 
gross earnings are less than $362,000 a year are exempt. The bill would raise 
the figure to $500,000.

SALES TAX INITIATIVE TO PAY FOR SAN DIEGO JAILS STRUCK DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a decision that could have far-reaching implications, a Superior Court judge 
on Thursday struck down a half-cent sales tax narrowly approved by San Diego 
County voters last June to raise $1.6 billion for new jails and courts on the 
grounds that the measure violated Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling that county officials "purposely circumvented" Proposition 13's 
requirement of a two-thirds vote for approval of new taxes, Riverside County 
Superior Court Judge Gordon Burkhart accepted opponents' arguments that voters' 
50.6% support for the sales tax was insufficient for its adoption. Accordingly, 
Burkhart ruled the Proposition A election invalid. 
</P>
<P>
That decision not only will exacerbate, at least temporarily, San Diego's 
longstanding problems of jail overcrowding and a badly overextended court 
system, but also has statewide import. 
</P>
<P>
If upheld on appeal, Burkhart's ruling could pose problems for other counties 
that were closely watching the San Diego case for guidance on meeting criminal 
justice and other needs. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials had not had an opportunity to review the ruling, but a 
spokeswoman for the county Transportation Commission said it did not appear the 
ruling would disrupt an existing half-cent sales tax for transit. That tax, 
which generates more than $300 million a year for rail projects and bus 
service, was approved by 54% of the voters in 1980. In 1982, the state Supreme 
Court ruled the tax did not violate Proposition 13 because it was not a 
"special" tax requiring two-thirds voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
But commission spokeswoman Erica Gobel said it is not clear how Thursday's 
ruling might affect a possible future ballot drive officials are considering to 
increase the sales tax for highway projects. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit that spawned Thursday's decision was heard in Riverside County 
Superior Court last December, with that site having been selected because of 
San Diego judges' obvious conflict of interest on a matter affecting future 
courtroom space. 
</P>
<P>
Legal ratifications of Proposition A, lawyers on both sides of the case agree, 
would make it easier to fatten civic treasuries by eliminating the need for the 
formidable two-thirds margin for new taxes mandated by Proposition 13, the 
landmark property tax-cutting initiative approved by California voters in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to win a case against the government or to overturn an election, 
but we always felt we had the facts and the law on our side," said a jubilant 
Thomas Homann, one of seven attorneys who filed the lawsuit on behalf of two 
Libertarian Party members and a leader of the 100-member United Taxpayers of 
San Diego. "It's gratifying that the judge saw Proposition A for what it was: a 
ruse to circumvent Proposition 13." 
</P>
<P>
County leaders sought to minimize their disappointment by describing Thursday's 
decision as simply the first round in a legal battle expected to ultimately 
reach the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed, but this isn't the end of the world, either," 
Supervisor George Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, attorney Louis Katz, Homann and their five colleagues described 
the 1987 state legislation that set the stage for last June's Proposition A 
campaign as a "sham" that illegally circumvented both the spirit and letter of 
Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 law set up the Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency to 
administer revenues generated by Proposition A -- estimated at $1.6 billion 
over its 10-year life. The funds, in turn, would be spent in accordance with 
plans developed and approved by the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The primary purpose behind the creation of the agency, Katz argued, was to 
"exploit loopholes" in Proposition 13 created by California Supreme Court 
rulings exempting local agencies not authorized to levy property taxes from the 
two-thirds vote requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Because the financing agency was not empowered to levy a property tax, 
officials reasoned that a simple majority vote would be sufficient for approval 
of a sales tax measure to support the agency's work. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the tactic argued that because the agency's expenditures were 
governed by plans drawn up and approved by the county Board of Supervisors, 
which does have power to levy a property tax, the whole notion was a sham to 
bypass Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Burkhart agreed, writing that the financing agency "was founded solely 
for the purpose of avoiding the strictures of Proposition 13."

PROGRAM WILL PAY TEENS NOT TO BECOME PREGNANT AGAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of high school girls in San Mateo County will be entering a program 
soon in which they will be paid $10 a week not to become pregnant -- again. 
</P>
<P>
As a one-year trial program sponsored by the Planned Parenthood organization, 
only teenagers who have become pregnant before will be invited to participate. 
</P>
<P>
"We reward young people who do well in school with scholarships. It's sort of 
the same thing," said Cathleen Gentry, an associate director of the San Mateo 
County chapter of the Planned Parenthood Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said the novel pay incentive program will be extended only to teen-agers 
who have become pregnant earlier because studies have shown that young people 
who have had the experience are 50% more likely to get pregnant again. 
</P>
<P>
She said that payments are also intended to persuade the teen-agers to attend 
weekly support group meetings regularly. At these sessions, they will discuss 
decision-making, peer relations and other issues affecting teen-age mothers, 
Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to start next month with 10 teen-agers from Redwood 
High School in Redwood City and from a community learning center in East Palo 
Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Because Planned Parenthood counselors usually recommend teen-agers maintain 
abstinence as the best method to avoid pregnancy, Gentry said much of the time 
will be used to teach the teen-agers how to say no to sex. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just about birth control. There are so many issues that result in 
teen pregnancy," Gentry said. "It will be run like a club. And you can only be 
a member if you don't get pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
The San Mateo County program is modeled after a pay incentive Planned 
Parenthood program in Denver that has been in existence since 1985. A Bay Area 
businessman, who heard about the Colorado program, offered Planned Parenthood 
$12,000 to start a similar program in San Mateo County. 
</P>
<P>
If the program proves successful, Gentry said the program's benefactor, who 
wants to remain anonymous, would like to extend it to other teen-agers in the 
county and expand it to the greater Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said the Colorado program succeeded in reducing the rate of pregnancy 
recurrence from 50% to 17%. 
</P>
<P>
But an official at the New York-based Alan Guttmacher Institute, a group that 
studies population trends, said the program is no more successful than other 
pregnancy counseling programs that did not use cash incentives. 
</P>
<P>
California has the highest teen-age pregnancy rate in the nation, with 142.7 
pregnancies for every thousand teen-agers between the ages of 15 and 19, 
according to a 1985 population and reproduction report published by UC San 
Francisco. In San Mateo County, the rate is 26.8 for every thousand teen-agers 
in the same age group, the same report stated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pregnancy Rate 
</P>
<P>
The national teen-age pregnancy rate was 111 per 1,000, according to a 1980 
report published by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The group will not use regular pregnancy tests, but instead will rely on the 
honor system and the grapevine to ensure that members do not become pregnant. 
"If someone gets pregnant, the other girls will know," Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood initially discussed restricting how the teen-agers should 
spend their money, but later chose to leave it to their discretion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to build up their decision-making. We'd be contradicting 
ourselves if we told them how to spend it," Gentry said.

Some 13,300 chocolate Easter bunnies distributed to schools and other

of several complaints about glass or similar objects found in the candy, 
company officials said Thursday. 
</P>

New Jersey authorities said testing confirmed that a sliver of glass was 
embedded in one piece of the candy made by Scott's of Wisconsin that was turned 
over to state officials for testing. No injuries were reported.

Authorities said product tampering was not suspected and a problem at the

HALL BREAKS DOWN ON WITNESS STAND; 
</P>
<P>
TEARFUL SECRETARY TELLS OF CHANGING MEMOS, HER REGARD FOR NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former White House secretary Fawn Hall, who wept repeatedly on the witness 
stand Thursday, said she was "very upset" by the 1986 firing of her boss, Lt. 
Col. Oliver L. North, and by "very confusing" recollections of altering and 
removing sensitive documents in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
As she testified a second and final day at North's federal court trial, Hall 
first broke down when she was pressed by prosecutor John W. Keker about how she 
had altered National Security Council memos at North's direction. She answered 
rapidly in an exasperated tone and overrode an effort by U.S. District Judge 
Gerhard A. Gesell to calm her down. 
</P>
<P>
An annoyed Gesell then told her: "Please keep your mouth shut when I'm 
talking." Hall bit her lip, asked for a break and began weeping as the judge 
called a 10-minute recess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tears Come Again 
</P>
<P>
But, an hour later, her tears came again when Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's 
attorney, gently asked her about working for North and whether she knew North's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
After brushing her eyes, she said that North had been "a very inspirational, 
tireless boss" and that she had met his wife, Betsy, one Easter. When she was 
unable to continue, Gesell said that jurors could take their morning recess a 
few minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes filled with tears a third time -- but she regained her poise and 
continued -- in telling the jury that former President Ronald Reagan's firing 
of North on Nov. 25, 1986, "was very unfair and I was very upset." 
</P>
<P>
Hall added that she has been through "very confusing" times in trying to answer 
questions about how she altered and shredded documents and removed other files 
in response to inquiries from Congress, from a federal grand jury and now from 
trial attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did Not Lock Doors 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't lock the doors and pull down the shades or anything," she said of 
what has been called her "shredding party" with North shortly before his firing 
as a National Security Council official. 
</P>
<P>
"It was no big deal. But, in hindsight, it was a very stupid thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
When she said that "I was concerned about security . . . protecting the 
operations for rescuing hostages" in which North had been involved, Hall was 
brought up short by Keker. The prosecutor forced her to acknowledge that all 
the documents she altered, shredded or removed under her clothing had to do 
with North's support for the Nicaraguan Contras, which he was seeking to 
conceal, rather than his past efforts to free American hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell later reminded jurors that there are no charges of illegality involving 
the White House efforts to free hostages in which North took part. 
</P>
<P>
North is being tried on 12 felony charges, including false statements to 
Congress to conceal his efforts to assist the Contras with money and military 
advice at a time when Congress had prohibited direct and indirect U.S. military 
aid. Other principal charges are that he destroyed documents and obstructed 
congressional and presidential inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draws Packed Courtroom 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a strand of pearls and a belted blue dress with large polka dots, Hall, 
who became an instant celebrity when she testified at nationally televised 
congressional hearings two years ago, drew a packed courtroom for Thursday's 
testimony. At least another 100 spectators were waiting in the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing her testimony, which was given under a promise of immunity from 
prosecution, a defiant Hall told reporters outside the courthouse: "Hopefully, 
the good guy will win." 
</P>
<P>
"Why was it so tough in there?" a reporter shouted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when people portray you as a witness for the prosecution, when 
you're a witness for the truth," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell recessed the trial until Tuesday morning, giving jurors a four-day 
holiday that includes Good Friday as well as Easter Monday.

STUDY SHOWS YOUNGER WOMEN IN N.Y. CITY HAVE 1-IN-77 AIDS VIRUS INFECTION RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One in every 77 women of childbearing age in New York City is infected with the 
virus that causes AIDS, according to a new study that officials say offers one 
of the first accurate pictures of how the disease is spreading in the 
population at large. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of infection in infants born in New York state, one of the first in 
a series being conducted by 44 states and territories, also found that one in 
every 151 women of childbearing age statewide is infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
</P>
<P>
"I would certainly think the word 'alarming' would be an apt descriptor," said 
Dr. Lloyd F. Novick, the New York state health official who headed the study. 
". . . A key aspect to follow is (whether) this rate of infection will decrease 
or increase over time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Published in Journal 
</P>
<P>
The survey results, published today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn., are among the first to be published in the nationwide series. The 
studies may eventually offer the only truly representative estimate of the 
extent and direction of the virus' spread. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results from a similar California study indicate the infection rate 
among childbearing women is much lower here than in New York, offering what 
public health officials say is a valuable opportunity to slow the spread of 
AIDS in that crucial group. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps the health department know where there's a problem, what it is, is it 
changing over time," said Dr. Timothy J. Dondero of the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control. "It doesn't answer all the questions, but at least it tells 
them where they need to focus." 
</P>
<P>
The New York study -- intended to measure the infection rate among childbearing 
women, monitor trends and help pinpoint AIDS education and prevention efforts 
-- was based on blood samples required by law to be taken from every baby born 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Samples Taken Over Year 
</P>
<P>
Samples were taken from 276,609 newborns between Nov. 30, 1987, and Nov. 30, 
1988. Antibodies to the AIDS virus were detected in 0.66% or 1,816 newborns 
statewide. The rate in New York City was 1.25%. Blacks and Latinos were the 
hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of those newborns will turn out to be infected, the researchers noted. 
They estimated that about 40% were actually infected, while the remainder will 
prove to be uninfected but temporarily carrying their infected mother's 
antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Novick noted that the estimate of 726 infected babies in a single year 
contrasts sharply with the number of pediatric AIDS cases reported in the 
state. Only 117 cases were reported in 1987; the cumulative total through 1988 
was only 422. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very different from the type of estimate one gets from looking at the 
reported cases of AIDS in New York," Novick said of his findings. ". . . It's 
likely that there are many more children (infected or with AIDS) in the 
community than what we know about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Directs Health Center 
</P>
<P>
Novick is the director of the state's Center for Community Health. 
</P>
<P>
In California, a similar study by the state Department of Health Services found 
the rate of infection among newborns to be 0.083% -- compared to 0.66% in the 
New York study. Los Angeles County officials put the rate among childbearing 
women in the county at 0.042%. 
</P>
<P>
The only other published results from the studies throughout the nation came 
from Massachusetts, where the rate was 0.21%. Alluding to preliminary findings 
from other states, Dondero called the New York numbers "the highest of the 
states we're aware of at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Novick's study did not explore how the mothers had become infected. But the 
geographical patterns of infection correlated with areas of high drug use. The 
areas with high infection rates were the same communities that have high rates 
of drug-related hospital discharges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Findings 
</P>
<P>
That observation is consistent with previous findings that intravenous drug use 
and sex with infected partners are the leading causes of HIV infection among 
New York women (although the overall HIV infection rate among drug users in New 
York City and San Francisco appears to be leveling off). The virus is 
transmitted sexually and through the exchange of blood -- for example, in 
shared needles. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say surveys like the one in New York may end up providing the only 
truly representative picture of the epidemic's spread. Most other studies of 
the extent of infection focus on more narrowly defined groups and are less 
representative of the general public.

SAFETY OF AIDS HOME TEST KITS STILL DOUBTED BY FDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal health officials Thursday said that they remain skeptical about the 
"safety and accuracy" of new home testing kits for detecting the AIDS virus and 
said that the government must be cautious before approving their sale. 
</P>
<P>
Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Frank E. Young, testifying before a 
House subcommittee, said that a final decision has not been made on the home 
testing kits. The FDA has rebuffed company requests to market the kits and 
plans a public hearing on the issue next month. 
</P>
<P>
But some manufacturers charged that the FDA was unfairly blocking their 
marketing efforts by refusing to review their license applications for the 
kits. They contended that the kits, by allowing maximum privacy, would 
encourage testing more people for the virus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gathering More Information 
</P>
<P>
Young said that the FDA is gathering more information on the kits and will ask 
company representatives to address the health agency's concerns at an April 6 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Caution at this time is prudent," Young said before the House Small Business 
Committee's subcommittee on regulations, business opportunities and energy. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that federal officials fear at-home AIDS test results would be 
unreliable, both because the tests would be performed by untrained people and 
because some people may not be able to follow the directions accurately. 
"Nothing can substitute for well-qualified individuals using . . . effective 
tests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that further problems could result when blood samples drawn with the 
kits were shipped to a laboratory for analysis. Delays in arrival of the sample 
and exposure to temperature extremes could affect the results, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Call Lab 
</P>
<P>
After sending off their blood samples, those tested could call the lab about a 
week later, identify themselves with a special code number and receive the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the at-home tests said they are concerned that those testing 
positive would not receive proper counseling. "Patients may quickly interpret 
positive results as a virtual death warrant," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the 
subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"In the hands of the untrained, the unscrupulous and the insensitive, home AIDS 
testing can inflict considerable human damage," Wyden said. 
</P>
<P>
Elliot J. Millenson, president of Cross Industry Management of Rockville, Md., 
complained that the FDA has refused to review license applications for any 
company developing home testing kits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Feasible to Implement' 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of home testing makes sense," Millenson said. "It is feasible to 
implement, and the potential benefits appear to be far greater than potential 
risks." 
</P>
<P>
Millenson, whose company has developed a home testing kit, said that 
professional counseling would be provided to people using the kit. But critics 
said that the telephone counseling may be inadequate for a disease that is 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the FDA, by adopting a cautious stance on home testing kits, does 
not intend to discourage people from taking the AIDS virus test. With testing 
now available at many clinics and other health facilities, "we're not robbing 
people of access to tests," Young said.

Police launched an investigation Thursday after Western journalists 
photographed plainclothes police officers who had pasted press signs on their 
car to disguise their identity while investigating Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The incident drew a formal complaint from the Foreign Press Assn. in Israel, 
which said in a letter to the government that such action places journalists 
"at great personal risk" and urged authorities "to cease such behavior 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
The army and other security agencies repeatedly have denied rumors that their 
agents pose as reporters to get into Arab areas to observe suspects and make 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Journalists' Fears 
</P>
<P>
Journalists covering the 15-month Palestinian uprising have expressed fears 
that such activity could endanger them if Arabs became fearful of vehicles with 
press tags. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said there were two policemen involved, "but it 
was the idea of just one of them, his own personal idea." 
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner David Krauss has asked that an officer be appointed to 
investigate the matter, Sandori said. 
</P>
<P>
The policemen will remain on duty while the inquiry is made. "The policeman 
(whose idea it allegedly was) did not break the law, but of course this is a 
case of ethics," Sandori said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spotted by London Crew 
</P>
<P>
Among the journalists who saw the undercover policemen using a car with a press 
sign was a crew from the London-based Visnews television agency. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Sposito, the Visnews bureau chief in Israel, said a team first noticed 
the car parked near one of the gates to Jerusalem's Old City. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a late-model Subaru, a rental car, with handwritten press signs in the 
front and rear windows," Sposito said. " 'Press' was written in English." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crew Becomes Suspicious 
</P>
<P>
The crew became suspicious when it did not recognize the men in the car and 
photographed them. 
</P>
<P>
About three hours later, Sposito said, Visnews photographed the same two men 
arresting Palestinian women after a stone-throwing incident in an Arab East 
Jerusalem neighborhood, Sposito said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both were armed with sidearms and had handcuffs," he said. "One was talking on 
a police radio, and one was dragging a Palestinian girl away after arresting 
her." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arab Boy Reported Killed 
</P>
<P>
In the continuing violence, soldiers shot and wounded six Palestinians on 
Thursday in the Gaza Strip. In the West Bank, 12 people were wounded and a 
14-year-old boy was killed, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the village of Usarin, south of Nablus in the West Bank, Maher Shakid Said 
died after being shot in the chest, according to officials of Ittihad Hospital 
in Nablus. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a military court sentenced four Palestinian guerrillas to life 
imprisonment for trying to enter Israel from Lebanon last year. The 
Palestinians confessed to the attempt and said they belonged to the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical Syrian-based faction of the 
PLO.

Yasser Arafat said Thursday that the second formal meeting between U.S. and PLO 
representatives was encouraging and reflects the desire of both sides to make 
the dialogue a success. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the content of the meeting was positive and bore the stamp of 
seriousness. . . . This is an indication of the interest which we and the U.S. 
Administration are giving to this dialogue," he told a news conference here. 
</P>
<P>
To a reporter who asked the smiling chairman of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization whether Wednesday's meeting was responsible for his good mood, 
Arafat replied, "Yes, exactly." 
</P>
<P>
He described the meeting between U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. and 
Yasser Abed-Rabho of the PLO executive committee as "positive and serious" but 
gave few details of the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau and Abed-Rabho met for 4 1/2 hours at the Tunisian government's 
guest house. Afterward, Pelletreau declined to talk about the meeting and 
referred all inquiries to the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who received a detailed briefing into the early hours of Thursday, 
played down the differences between the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the two sides have the firm will to pursue this dialogue and bring 
it to a fruitful conclusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Americans ask him to stop the 15-month-old uprising in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that has taken the lives of about 400 
Palestinians? 
</P>
<P>
"No one presented such a request, and no one can ask a people to stop resisting 
an occupation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication whether a third meeting was scheduled, but the PLO 
chief's mood suggested that the dialogue will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the agenda was loaded with a lot of subjects to be discussed 
shows clearly the importance given to it both by the U.S. Administration and 
the PLO," he said. "Its importance is even greater if you take into 
consideration all the Israeli efforts to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Palestinian measures to reduce tension in the Middle East, Arafat 
said the query should be addressed to the Israelis because "it is they who are 
causing tension, with the Israeli army and the armed settler groups using force 
against the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat was asked about the unexplained delay in organizing an exile Palestinian 
government and said the Palestine National Council wants to include 
representatives of Palestinians living inside Palestine, which includes Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know how the Israelis will react to those who are appointed," he 
said. "Will they deport them, or put them in jail, or put them to death?"

NUCLEAR FUSION EXPERIMENTS WERE STARTED 'FOR THE FUN OF IT'

SALT LAKE CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dramatic finding that could propel two virtually unknown chemists into 
scientific history began to take shape five years ago on a hike up Millcreek 
Canyon on the outskirts of Salt Lake City and culminated in a fateful decision 
in a family kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton in England and 
B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah, who for years had been intrigued by 
what they termed inexplicably "odd" data from separate research efforts, sat 
down in the kitchen of Pons' Salt Lake City home and agreed to embark upon an 
experiment "for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
"We like to talk about things that people ought to have done but haven't and 
whether we can do them," Fleischmann said in an interview here. "Sometimes we 
like to talk about the impossible just for fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the idea was so stupid that we decided to finance it ourselves," he 
added at a press conference. They invested $100,000 of their own money in the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they say they have accomplished something that has eluded researchers for 
more than 30 years -- the successful creation of a sustained nuclear fusion. 
</P>
<P>
Although their findings have yet to be confirmed by independent researchers, 
Fleischmann and Pons may have opened an unexpected threshold in fusion research 
that could usher in a new age of limitless, safe and pollution-free energy. 
</P>
<P>
The two researchers are virtually unknown among the cadre of physicists who 
have been pressing costly government-funded research programs into controlling 
fusion reactions. 
</P>
<P>
But Fleischmann and Pons said they believed that it was their expertise in 
chemistry -- augmenting their knowledge of physics -- that led to the 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"Without our particular backgrounds, you wouldn't think of the combination of 
circumstances required to get this to work," said Pons, 46, a slightly graying, 
immaculately tailored man with a Julius Caesar haircut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Combination of Knowledge' 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we are singularly fortunate in having the combination of knowledge 
that allowed us to accomplish a fusion reaction in this new way," Fleischmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The path to the discovery began in the late 1960s, said Fleischmann, a native 
of Czechoslovakia and naturalized British subject who will celebrate his 62nd 
birthday on Wednesday. Fleischmann was conducting research on the separation of 
hydrogen and deuterium isotopes at the University of Southhampton. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of enriching deuterium, Fleischmann noticed what he termed "odd" 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Pons, who studied under Fleischmann in 1975 as a graduate student in England, 
noticed similar oddities years later in separate research on isotopic 
separation in electrodes. 
</P>
<P>
It was during one of Fleischmann's annual visits to Utah to compare notes and 
to conduct joint research that the two began to seriously focus on the unusual 
findings. Hiking into Millcreek Canyon in the Wasatch Mountains, both 
researchers said they became increasingly excited about the possibilities. 
Discussion during a subsequent drive across Texas to attend a scientific 
conference settled the issue. 
</P>
<P>
A month later they met in Pons' family kitchen and drafted plans for the 
experiment that led to Thursday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Had to Try It' 
</P>
<P>
"The stakes were so high with this one, we decided we had to try it," 
Fleischmann said. "It had a one-in-a-billion chance of working, although it 
made perfectly good scientific sense." 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, they reported, there were strong indications that they were 
onto something important. But they also realized their approach was unorthodox. 
Rather than apply for a government grant, they used their own money. 
</P>
<P>
During the next five years they improved, tested and retested the procedure on 
weekends and at night in Pons' lab at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
What they achieved, they said, was the first nuclear fusion reaction at room 
temperature, a reaction that they said they sustained for hundreds of hours. In 
a phrase, they were getting back more energy than they were putting into the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, the discovery could lead eventually to the use of nuclear fusion 
for the world's energy needs. Many believe that it could replace fossil fuel 
like coal, gas and oil, which is being depleted and is a major cause of such 
environmental problems as urban air pollution, global warming and acid rain.

The Zimbabwe Red Cross has launched an appeal for donkeys to replace 
wheelchairs used by disabled people in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the point of giving a disabled person a wheelchair in the rural areas 
where you know it's unnavigable and long distances are involved?" spokesman 
Victor Chitongo asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A donkey has been found to be suitable because it's unlike a wheelchair which 
needs repairs," he said. "It feeds while the user is in class." 
</P>
<P>
Chitongo said the society is willing to pay about $15 for each donkey, about a 
tenth the cost of a wheelchair.

President Bush, stepping into a State Department spat, worked out a compromise 
with Paul H. Nitze that keeps the veteran arms control specialist working for 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a part-time basis, Administration 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Nitze, 82, wanted to stay on the job full-time as the Administration prepares 
to resume negotiations with the Soviet Union on nuclear weapons reductions. 
But, the officials said, he initially was offered only the role of 
ambassador-emeritus, meaning he would be on occasional call, and turned it 
down. Nitze's resignation as a full-time adviser, effective May 1, stands.

SAUDI OIL OFFICIAL'S SON SURRENDERS ON 1982 CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A powerful Saudi Arabian oil official's son who jumped bail seven years ago 
after conviction on a reckless driving charge in Santa Barbara County has 
turned himself in, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tarek Abdulhadi Taher, 31, a former UC Santa Barbara student, fled in 1982 
after being sentenced to serve 45 days in jail for racing his Ferrari on U.S. 
101. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Santa Barbara County Dist. Atty. Darryl Perlin said a highly placed U.S. 
State Department lawyer unsuccessfully asked at that time that the case be 
dropped in the interest of good relations with oil-rich Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Taher was rearrested on a fugitive warrant three years later in Boston but 
disappeared once again when a judge there allowed him to remain free on 
$100,000 bail, rather than the $5 million requested by Santa Barbara County 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
He was not heard from again until this week, when his attorney telephoned, 
Perlin said. Taher surrendered himself Wednesday in the court of Municipal 
Judge Frank Ochoa, who -- under an agreement with the prosecutors -- ordered 
him to serve his 45-day sentence on a work furlough program. He will spend 
nights and weekends in jail while being allowed to work for a Santa Barbara 
real estate firm on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Simple ... Case' 
</P>
<P>
Perlin said the district attorney's office agreed to the deal because "it is a 
simple misdemeanor case and he is eligible for that (work furlough) anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said, "We feel this is one of the most significant cases ever 
handled by our office . . . because it took on international implications." 
</P>
<P>
He said that a senior U.S. State Department attorney called to express concern 
that "the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia could be 
jeopardized" if the matter was pursued. 
</P>
<P>
Perlin said the State Department lawyer pointed out that Taher is the son of 
Dr. Abdulhadi H. Taher, governor of the Saudi Arabian government-owned company 
that develops the Mideast nation's petroleum, petrochemical and mineral 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy who always got his way," Perlin said Thursday. "He finally came 
around."

 AZUSA SUED OVER MINING OF CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Azusa has been sued by two environmental groups claiming that it 
was negligent in fashioning a compromise last year to allow a controversial 
rock quarry to continue mining Fish Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by the Forest Preservation Society and the Committee to Save 
the Foothills, claims that the city has been negligent in the way it issues 
permits and oversees the 190-acre site mined by Azusa Rock Inc. A Pomona 
Superior Court judge has ordered the city to respond by April 19. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit asks Pomona Superior Court Judge Thomas F. Nuss to force the city 
to apply current state mining and environmental laws to the quarry. Such 
regulations would require a potentially lengthy and expensive environmental 
impact report, which the city and Azusa Rock contend is unnecessary.

SUSPECT WOUNDED;

<P>
4 ARRESTED IN MURDER AT AUTOMATED TELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four suspects have been arrested in the robbery and slaying of a man after he 
made a withdrawal from an automatic teller machine at a Northridge savings and 
loan, Los Angeles police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects, Elisaia Reupena, 26, was arrested late Wednesday in a 
Torrance hospital where he was being treated for gunshot wounds suffered during 
the struggle with the victim, Aslam Hasham, 29, of Canoga Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hasham was shot to death at 8:45 p.m. Tuesday in the Coast Savings parking lot 
at Nordhoff Street and Tampa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The other three suspects, Stephan Rice and Marty Mares, both 20, and a 
17-year-old boy, were arrested Thursday at their homes in Granada Hills, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All four, described by investigators as longtime friends, were being held 
without bail on suspicion of murder and could face charges in other robberies, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Valley Holdups 
</P>
<P>
"It is believed these four suspects were responsible for a number of ATM 
robberies throughout the San Fernando Valley," Lt. Harvie Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hasham was shot during a struggle with a gunman who accosted him 
after he made a withdrawal from an ATM at the side of the bank. Two of Hasham's 
friends, Omar Nasib, 27, and Shaharyar Shafquat, 20, were robbed by a second 
gunman while they sat nearby in a car. They were not hurt. Police declined to 
say how much money was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Reupena, believed to be from the Granada Hills area, was first questioned by 
police late Tuesday when officers were called to Granada Hills Community 
Hospital by staff members who reported a gunshot victim. 
</P>
<P>
Eubank said Reupena was being treated for wounds in both legs and told officers 
that he had been standing on a curb on Balboa Boulevard when he was hit by 
gunfire from a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
Reupena became a suspect in the Hasham slaying because police said they found 
no evidence of such a drive-by shooting. Meanwhile, investigators on the ATM 
case determined from blood and other evidence at the shooting scene that two 
people had been shot, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Knew Suspect Shot' 
</P>
<P>
"We knew one of the suspects had been shot," Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Reupena was transferred to the Torrance hospital for an unknown 
reason, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives were able to gather evidence linking him and his three friends to 
the robbery and slaying, Eubank said. But he would not elaborate on that 
evidence or on what part each of the suspects is believed to have played. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe all four went there with the intention of committing a robbery," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During questioning Thursday, one of the suspects admitted to investigators that 
the foursome had committed numerous robberies of ATM customers in recent weeks, 
Eubank said. He said detectives are attempting to learn the extent of the 
robbery spree.

SEPARATE CASE FOCUSES ON CARE HOME; 
</P>
<P>
STATE REVOKES LICENSE OF BABY-SITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State regulators, in separate actions, have revoked the license of a Canyon 
Country baby-sitter and accused the operator of a Canoga Park care home of 
intimidating its mentally handicapped residents. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Barone, a 54-year-old baby-sitter, is accused by the California 
Department of Social Services and the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office of breaking the leg of one infant and breaking the wrist of another on 
separate occasions last year. 
</P>
<P>
Barone was investigated but never charged in the 1985 death of an infant girl 
who had been in her care, and she remains under investigation in the case of a 
child who suffered a cut and bruises while at her home last year. The girl who 
died was the sister of one of the boys abused by Barone, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second action, state social services officials have announced that they 
intend to revoke the license of Joyce Steele, a care-home owner accused of 
intimidating, humiliating and hitting residents, most of whom are teen-agers 
and suffer from mental handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
Steele has contested the accusations and remains in business pending a hearing 
scheduled in June, according to Phillip Torres, a social services staff 
attorney assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the incidents center on Steele's handling of residents she said ate too 
much while at school, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Steele allegedly challenged a resident to eat a whole loaf of bread and when 
the man complied, he became ill and vomited, according to a social services 
report. She also forced a resident to attend school in a T-shirt that stated: 
"I'm not here to learn, I'm here to eat," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said Steele and her son, Mark, hit several residents. None of the 
incidents resulted in injuries requiring medical attention, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case involving the baby-sitter, the Department of Social Services 
initially suspended Barone's license pending a hearing, but it was 
automatically revoked when Barone failed to contest the accusations, according 
to Debra L. Ashbrook, a department lawyer who handled the case. Ashbrook said 
Barone, a licensed baby-sitter for 15 years, will not be allowed to apply for a 
new permit until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Barone was arraigned Jan. 24 and released after posting $7,500 bail. She has 
pleaded not guilty to two counts of child abuse and one count of corporal 
injury to a child. A pretrial conference is scheduled today in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Barone broke the right wrist of 3-month-old Jonathan 
Chong while baby-sitting for the child Dec. 28. Chong died Feb. 15 of an 
unrelated illness, said his father, Taek Y. Chong. 
</P>
<P>
Barone is also accused of breaking the leg of Michael Donato, who was 2 months 
old when the incident occurred in May. The boy suffered additional injuries, 
including bruises to his hands, chest, back and penis, when Barone baby-sat him 
July 11, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
Barone refused to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
According to a county Sheriff's Department report, Barone acknowledged during a 
polygraph test that she may have accidentally injured the boys. But her 
attorney, Robert R. Keimach, denied that his client abused them. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Barone was investigated after Jennifer Donato, Michael Donato's 
sister, died of head injuries, possibly caused when the infant fell from a 
table while in the care of her parents, Anthony and Charlotte Donato of Canyon 
Country, authorities said. No charges were filed in the case because coroner's 
investigators determined that the girl died as a result of an accidental fall, 
according to the sheriff's report. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also stated in the report that doctors who examined Jennifer Donato 
believed that her death was caused by severe shaking. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Coppola Jr., the parents' attorney, said Michael Donato, now 1, and 
his 7-year-old sister, Danielle, have been in protective custody since shortly 
after Michael was injured in July. Coppola, who is representing the Donatos in 
an ongoing custody case, refused to discuss details of the matter. An attorney 
from the county counsel's office, which is representing the county in the 
custody case, also refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Danielle Donato spent four months in protective custody after 
Jennifer's death, which sheriff's investigators said occurred under "suspicious 
child-abuse circumstances," according to the sheriff's report.

RESULTS OF STUDENT SENATE VOTE DUE TODAY; CHICANERY LIVES ON

Hanh Cao was angry. Her roommate was frightened. They had just learned that a 
right-wing student group called Young Americans for Freedom spiced up a press 
conference by proclaiming, "Death to Hanh!" 
</P>
<P>
Who is Hanh Cao and what is her crime? 
</P>
<P>
She is a USC student. She is in charge of the student body elections. 
</P>
<P>
Plainly, campus politics at USC are not for the timid. The death ditty -- just 
a joke, the YAFers say -- is only one episode in what ranks as a vintage year 
on a campus where political chicanery is something of a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Such second-drawer Watergate figures as Ronald Zeigler, Dwight Chapin, Gordon 
Strachan and Donald Segretti learned a few tricks here. Assemblyman Patrick 
Nolan (R-Glendale), now a subject of an FBI probe of alleged Capitol 
corruption, was not merely a Trojan, he was once Tommy Trojan, riding Traveler 
in the Rose Parade to the strains of "Conquest." Nolan was also, as a student, 
a YAF leader. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the power struggle essentially features the reigning Student Senate 
against a coalition of YAFers and other conservatives bent on takeover. Win or 
lose, conservatives say, their campaign is another sign of the growing 
conservatism on the nation's campuses.

Today, student officials are expected to announce the results of what has been 
the nastiest election in many years. Or rather, the nastiest two elections. The 
first election, two weeks ago, was voided amid charges of ballot-box stuffing. 
Some students admitted to a student judicial council they had voted more than 
once. 
</P>
<P>
YAFers, in turn, suggest this was an election Ferdinand Marcos would have 
loved. The Senate, they say, conspired to cheat them out of victory in the 
first election. (Those allegedly tainted ballots, for the record, were never 
counted.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Don't Care 
</P>
<P>
Before the drama becomes overwhelming, however, it is well to remember most USC 
students don't give a hoot about campus politics. More than 15,900 
undergraduates are eligible to vote; about 2,000 are expected to bother. 
</P>
<P>
Such apathy is bemoaned by student politicos. After all, they point out, the 
32-member Student Senate -- half graduate, half undergraduate -- controls 
nearly $1 million a year, funding some campus groups and disappointing others. 
It has pushed for such popular student causes as increased campus security, 
extended library hours and improved parking facilities, with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
This Senate has also tried to have a voice in what is sometimes called The Real 
World. It has attempted, unsuccessfully, to pressure USC's Board of Trustees to 
withdraw investments from corporations that do business with South Africa. Part 
of the idea, says Senate President Phil Clement, is to change USC's image from 
the "University of Spoiled Children" to the "University of Social 
Consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
But "this divestment thing," as conservative undergraduate Brad Walters put it, 
became a touchstone for campus conservatives. A coalition formed that includes 
several present and former members of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, in addition 
to the YAFers. The conservatives put together a full slate of 16 undergraduate 
candidates and at least one graduate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Presidential Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Segal, past president of the "Phi Delts" who is expected to graduate in 
June, assumed a leadership role and entered the race for a graduate seat. 
Inspired by a class taught by well-known Los Angeles political consultant 
Joseph Cerrell, Segal developed a game plan he called "a microcosm of the 
presidential election." 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Bush people turned that election into a referendum on liberalism, 
the student conservatives made their contest a referendum on the Senate, 
arguing that it is too liberal to represent USC's student body. In addition to 
divestment, they attacked Senate "junkets" and funding for a gay and lesbian 
students group. 
</P>
<P>
Student senators counterattacked, labeling YAF as extremist. "I've been quoted 
as saying YAF is half a step left of the skinheads, and I do believe that," 
Clements said recently. The Student Senate, on the other hand, is a mix of 
liberals, moderates and conservatives that fairly reflects USC's student body, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
YAF President Ken Dubberly, 21, concedes that his group has an image problem -- 
so much so that he has left references to YAF off some campaign advertisements. 
Dubberly insists the USC chapter, which claims 75 members, is part of the 
conservative mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"People call us racist, but we're not," he said. "People call us Nazis, but I 
don't think those people know the meaning of fascism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Irregularities 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, some conservative candidates were accused of campaign 
irregularities. Under the election rules, the 16 undergraduate seats are 
divided among four constituencies: four seats representing the Greeks, four 
representing residence halls, four for students who live off-campus in the 
immediate ZIP code area and four for commuter students. 
</P>
<P>
Five conservatives, including Segal, were disqualified for running for seats 
for which they did not qualify. Later, some were reinstated -- but only as 
write-in candidates. "I was railroaded," Segal said. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the first elections, from March 6 to March 10. More than 2,300 
students voted, the most in years, but there were numerous charges of 
ballot-box stuffing -- students were able to enter the voting area more than 
once because lax poll watchers did not cross off their names the first time 
they voted. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the student Judicial Council wiped out the election and ordered 
stricter guidelines for a replacement contest. Candidate eligibility rules were 
clarified, and the manager of the first election -- a conservative -- was 
stripped of his duties. In stepped Hanh Cao, a member of the Judicial Council 
who had run elections in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Clement denies YAF allegations that student government leaders conspired 
against conservatives, noting that he and other senators had argued to let the 
first election stand. 
</P>
<P>
"They say the rules were designed to keep them out," he said. "Well, they're 
the ones who are breaking the rules. The rules were designed to keep out the 
people who break the rules." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tactics Tame Now 
</P>
<P>
Cerrell, the influential political science instructor, sees USC's current 
electoral troubles as tame compared to the "shenanigans" of yore. When he 
attended USC in the 1950s, he once hired a stripper named "Patti Waggin" to 
drum up support for his candidate among the fraternities. Even so, "my guy 
lost," Cerrell said. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, troubles in the 1971 student election prompted the USC 
administration to abolish the old government system and develop a new one. 
Clement maintains that political life has been relatively clean over the last 
few years, especially when contrasted with other campuses. At student 
leadership conferences, Clement says, politicians from other schools sometimes 
boast about how they've rigged the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conservatives accuse Clement and other senators of rigging this 
one, they at times have proved to be their own worst enemy. Such was the case 
at the press conference held last weekend to denounce the senate's handling of 
the election -- marred when at least one YAFer proclaimed, "Death to Hanh." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned on campus this week, the group's leaders initially disavowed any 
knowledge of such statements. "It's stupid to call for someone's death. We're 
not right-wing death squads roaming the campus," said YAFer Wayne Bowen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Joke 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, Segal offered another version of the press conference after 
complaining that published reports blew it out of proportion. What really 
happened, he said, was that the guys were getting their picture taken, and 
instead of saying "cheese," somebody said, "Death to Hanh." Just a joke, he 
stressed. Others confirmed this account. 
</P>
<P>
That is the version that Hanh Cao accepts. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Death to Hanh' . . . that's what makes them smile," the election 
commissioner said. "Right now I want to treat it like it never happened and 
just do the elections and get it over with. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I won't have to deal with these people again."

PAYING TO UPGRADE TREATMENT SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
SEWER BILLS SEEN NEARLY DOUBLING BY '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diegans' monthly sewer bills will nearly double and could go higher by 1995 
to pay for the multibillion-dollar cost of upgrading the city's sewage 
treatment system, according to a report released Thursday by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
With six plans for the mammoth public works project still under consideration, 
monthly sewer bills -- now $13.52 for a single-family household -- would rise 
to $25.19 under the cheapest, $2.4-billion alternative and could jump to $33.36 
under the most expensive, $4.2-billion plan, the report shows. 
</P>
<P>
The two alternatives now favored by sewer-system planners and some San Diego 
City Council members would increase monthly sewer bills to $26.30 or $27.94. 
Those two systems would cost $2.5 billion and $2.72 billion. The $4.2-billion 
alternative, which would involve pumping effluent over the Laguna mountains for 
agricultural use in the Imperial Valley, is considered extremely unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The city is upgrading its sewage-treatment system to comply with the federal 
Clean Water Act, which set a deadline of last July 1 for U. S. cities to 
install technology required to remove 85% to 90% of suspended solids from 
sewage -- so-called "secondary" treatment. The city's "advanced primary" system 
removes 75% of the solids. 
</P>
<P>
The construction prices also include the substantial cost of further cleaning 
the water so that it can be recycled for irrigation and other uses, a process 
known as water reclamation that the city believes will be essential to 
counteract water shortages forecast for coming years. 
</P>
<P>
The federal and state governments have sued the city over how quickly the new 
system will be installed and, as part of the suit, are seeking fines that could 
cost the city millions of dollars for past sewage spills into the ocean and 
local waterways. 
</P>
<P>
The projected sewer bills for the 1 million city members of the Metropolitan 
Sewerage System are smaller than predicted a year ago, when some officials 
suggested that they could rise to nearly $40 per month in three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
About 25% of the cost of each alternative is for unknown contingencies such as 
labor strikes, equipment delivery delays, archaeologic discoveries, permit 
delivery delays or fires that could drive up the final costs. Deputy City 
Manager H.R. Frauenfelder said that the money will almost certainly be spent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have too much contingency built in. I think we'll use it," 
Frauenfelder said. 
</P>
<P>
The estimates do not include inflation or Mayor Maureen O'Connor's attempts to 
convince the federal government to contribute as much as 55% of the costs, the 
amount given to other cities before grant funds dried up. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of using some of that money to construct a treatment system, the city 
chose to get waivers from Clean Water Act regulations until 1987, when O'Connor 
convinced the council to abandon that policy. O'Connor adopted that policy only 
because she was promised Environmental Protection Agency assistance in winning 
financial help, said Paul Downey, the mayor's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little High' 
</P>
<P>
The prices "are, from our perspective, a little high, because we are hopeful of 
getting federal funding, and we'd like to get it at the 55% level," Downey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts, an architect of the council's water reclamation policy, 
said Thursday that the city must pursue the federal funding in concert with 
Boston, Seattle, San Francisco, Portland, Me., and other cities facing 
similarly large construction bills. 
</P>
<P>
However, an aide to Bruce Henderson, the most outspoken council critic of the 
construction plan, said that the sewer bill projections are grossly 
underestimated, and could reach $50 per month when the costs of inflation, 
future development and cost overruns begin to become apparent. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and consultants planning the project envision a system capable 
of handling 340 million gallons of sewage each day by the year 2050, a 
substantial increase from the 190 million gallons currently produced each day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Million Gallons Reclaimed 
</P>
<P>
They also want to reclaim 120 million gallons of water daily by 2010. The 
current system reclaims about 1 million gallons of water daily. The 
alternatives include secondary treatment at the city's existing Point Loma 
sewage treatment plant, and at new plants in the North City, the South Bay or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the scenarios, water reclamation would occur at the new plants and 
at satellite plants throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Design of the system could begin by late 1990 or early 1991, and the first 
ground-breaking would be two years later. Frauenfelder declined to comment on 
when the system might be completed because that subject is central to the 
city's legal battle with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which is 
seeking an earlier completion date than the city believes it can meet. 
</P>
<P>
Frauenfelder said that sewer bills are not expected to rise substantially after 
1995, except to reflect inflation. The city's Water Utilities department 
expects to ask for the first of a series of price hikes this summer, he said.

4 TEEN-AGERS DENY TORCHING SCHOOLS IN ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Escondido high school students denied Thursday that they had a part in 
four arsons at Escondido schools and were ordered to undergo psychiatric tests 
while remaining in custody at Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The four are a 17-year-old senior at Valley Continuation High School charged 
only in the March 10 fire and burglary at an Escondido High School portable 
classroom, a 16-year-old sophomore girl at Valley charged with two counts of 
burglary and two of arson involving fires at Orange Glen High School and Del 
Dios Middle School, and two teen-age boys, charged with arson and burglary in 
each of four fires that caused more than $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, handcuffed in pairs, appeared Thursday morning before Superior 
Court Judge Sheridan Reed, presiding judge of the juvenile courts, who denied 
petitions from three of the youths for release to their parents and ordered the 
psychiatric examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Richard E. Mills, representing one of the youths, argued that the boy 
had no criminal record, would not be a danger to society and should be allowed 
to return to his classes so he can graduate in June, and also return to his 
after-school job. 
</P>
<P>
But Reed said she will release the youngsters only after court-ordered 
psychiatric exams are completed and some showing can be made that the arsons 
were "a total aberration" in the behavior of the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Three fires set last Saturday night destroyed the theater arts section of the 
Escondido High multipurpose building and heavily damaged the cafeteria and 
food-preparation areas of the same building, gutted three classrooms and 
damaged others at Orange Glen High and caused about $35,000 damage to a 
portable classroom and storage building at Del Dios. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos O. Armour, chief deputy district attorney for the juvenile courts, said 
his office will seek to try all four teen-agers as adults because of the major 
damage that occurred and the possibility that loss of life could have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Armour acknowledged that the four had no criminal records but pointed to the 
"thousands of North County citizens" who were traumatized by the torching of 
the three Escondido school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Reed set April 11 hearings for the decision on whether the four will be tried 
as adults or juveniles. If tried as adults in Superior Court, two of the youths 
could face maximum prison terms of up to 36 years -- six years' sentence on 
each of four arson counts, and three years' sentence on each of the four 
burglary counts, Armour said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of the four teen-agers sat in Reed's courtroom during the brief 
hearing, their eyes on their youngsters. The four suspects, clad casually in 
sweat-shirts, T-shirts, slacks and jeans, were brought into the court through a 
back entrance. The four kept their heads bowed during much of the hearing, not 
returning their parents' stares.

 EX-RESTAURATEUR HELD ON THEFT CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Torrance restaurateur who prosecutors say used bogus checks to steal 
almost $250,000 before fleeing to Australia seven years ago was ordered held 
without bail Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Magistrate George King agreed with the prosecutor who said that James 
McGrail, 52, who was extradited to the United States last week, is "a severe 
risk for flight." 
</P>
<P>
McGrail, who owned the now-defunct Bounty Restaurant, is charged with two 
counts of transporting forged checks and three counts of bank larceny. 
Officials said the former Palos Verdes resident altered a $125 insurance draft 
issued to pay for his son's medical bills so that it read $125,000 and 
deposited the check in the Torrance branch of Security Pacific Bank, along with 
a stolen check for $172,879 from a bank in Essex, England. 
</P>
<P>
McGrail has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Alan Launspach, argued that McGrail 
should have been granted bail because he had the opportunity to flee while free 
on bond in Australia -- where he fought extradition for three months -- but did 
not.

 DRIVE SEEKS TO BAN BEACH CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Santa Monica slow-growth activists launched an initiative drive 
Thursday to ban the construction of hotels, motels and large restaurants on 
Santa Monica Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the newly formed "Save Our Beach Committee" said they hope 
to gather 10,000 signatures to put the initiative on the ballot in a special 
election later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Gilpin, a veteran of previous slow-growth campaigns, said she and a 
handful of activists began the drive because of a "flood" of hotel and motel 
construction in her beach neighborhood in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed initiative would target a zone from Santa Monica's northern border 
along Ocean Avenue and Nielson Way to the city's southern border, with the 
exception of Santa Monica Pier.

PERJURY PROBE ASKED IN BEER-WORK CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County public works supervisor's denial that he granted overtime 
work to employees in exchange for cases of beer prompted a Civil Service 
Commission officer on Thursday to call for an investigation into possible 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Bonilla, a bridge maintenance superintendent, had appeared at a three-day 
hearing and refuted charges that he handed out the extra work assignments to 
employees who brought him cases of Corona beer. 
</P>
<P>
But after half a dozen workers testified that they took part in the 
beer-for-work swap, hearing officer Arnold L. Faber questioned Bonilla's denial 
and said that he had "never seen a witness so blatantly lie." He said he would 
recommend that the district attorney investigate the case for possible perjury 
charges.

 UNIVERSAL, GARNER SETTLE OUT OF COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor James Garner's $16.5-million lawsuit against Universal Studios, scheduled 
to go to trial Monday after a six-year wait, was settled out of court Thursday 
for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
Garner sued the Universal City studio for fraud, deceit and breach of contract 
for paying the actor what he said was a mere fraction of the 37.5% of earnings 
from reruns and foreign sales of his 1974-80 TV series "The Rockford Files" 
promised by his contract. Garner had charged that creative bookkeeping on the 
part of Universal had cheated him out of his share of the show's net profits in 
syndication, leaving him with $249,000 out of gross revenues of $119 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I can live with this deal, and live very comfortably," Garner said in a 
prepared statement. Although it was part of the terms of Garner's agreement 
that the amount of the settlement not be revealed, Garner had previously turned 
down an offer from Universal of more than $6 million.

QUAKE-DAMAGED LIBRARIES TO BE CLOSED; 
</P>
<P>
9 OF 10 DATES SET; 5 OTHERS ALREADY SHUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE and BOB POOL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian Renaissance-style structure on Workman Street a few miles east of 
downtown is an architectural gem, honored as one of Los Angeles' most 
distinguished buildings when it was constructed in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two-story, yellow brick-stucco building has become an integral 
part of the Lincoln Heights community as a Los Angeles Public Library branch 
housing about 39,000 books and a public meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, it was on the Board of Library Commissioners agenda as one of 
10 inner-city libraries to be closed because of structural damage sustained in 
the October, 1987, Whittier earthquake. All were given closing dates Thursday 
except the Lincoln Heights branch. 
</P>
<P>
Five other inner-city branches, also damaged in the quake, already have been 
shut down. Four of these five have been moved to temporary, storefront 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The city, lacking sufficient funds to make the old buildings safe, has decided 
to close them until enough money is found to bolster them. The federal 
government and the city have together earmarked a total of $16 million toward 
the 10 libraries, but the city must come up with another $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Los Angeles City Council asked voters to approve a bond 
measure that would have provided remodeling funds for the branch libraries and 
the fire-ravaged Central Library downtown. But it was narrowly defeated after 
it was opposed by Councilman Nate Holden, who vigorously objected to including 
the Central Library.

City voters will again be asked -- on April 11 -- to approve a bond measure, 
but this time the Central Library is not included. Holden, who is running for 
mayor, said he supports this measure, which calls for $53 million to repair or 
expand these and other old libraries and to build three new ones in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Heights got no closing date Thursday only because Department of 
Building and Safety officials have not yet submitted one to the library board, 
a library spokesman said. However, it is one of the branches facing serious 
financial problems -- requiring $1.3 million for reconstruction with, so far, 
only $250,000 in hand. 
</P>
<P>
The branch's librarian, Jose Taylor, said in an interview that he is optimistic 
that city officials will somehow find a way to save the historic building. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they will come up with money one way or another," said Taylor, 58, who 
has been the branch's chief librarian for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
If the bond issue is again rejected -- it needs a "yes" vote of at least 
two-thirds of the ballots cast -- Taylor said he was confident lawmakers "would 
try again" to raise the cash. Simply closing down the branch was unthinkable, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holden wondered why the library board did not wait to proceed with the closing 
preparations until voters can decide on the bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
Fontayne Holmes, assistant director of the library branches, said the bond 
measure would come too late to avoid closing the libraries for at least a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a ploy," Holmes said. "We would be dealing with this even if there 
was no bond issue. But passage of the bond will help us deal with this problem 
in a speedier manner." 
</P>
<P>
The following Los Angeles branch libraries have been targeted by the Board of 
Library Commissioners as seismically unsafe, and face closure:

LATINOS IN U.S. URGED TO MAKE THEMSELVES COUNT IN 1990 CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to improve the historical under-count of Latinos by U.S. Census 
takers, officials and activists in Los Angeles and in other areas across the 
country launched a campaign Thursday to encourage Latinos to "make themselves 
count" in the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
The official 1980 count missed as many as 10% of U.S. Latinos, according to 
campaign organizers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Latinos have been "denied full representation in our society," 
said Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who joined other campaign 
supporters at a press conference at Olvera Plaza downtown. She noted that 
census figures are the basis for distributing billions of dollars in government 
funds, as well as for congressional reapportionment and the redrawing of local 
political districts. 
</P>
<P>
Molina added, "Californians as a whole will be shortchanged if Hispanics are 
under-counted." 
</P>
<P>
About a fourth of the state's residents are Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong community outreach and national media campaign, sponsored by the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and funded by $450,000 in 
corporate and foundation grants, will work to enlist the support of Latino 
leaders, local organizations, churches and schools in a broad-based community 
education program, said Jose Garza of MALDEF. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign will focus on the Southwest, where nearly two-thirds of the 
nation's Latinos live, as well as the Chicago area, with its growing Latino 
population, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign organizers said they hope to make the slogan "!Hagase contar!" (Make 
yourself count!), a Latino household phrase by April 1, 1990 -- the day of the 
national decennial count. 
</P>
<P>
The effort's national media campaign has enlisted the support of Univision, the 
largest Spanish-language television network in the nation. Plans are to produce 
an array of television spots as well as special news programs and a telethon to 
educate the Spanish-speaking public on the importance of the census, network 
representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
The network and MALDEF were involved in similar though more modest campaigns a 
decade ago for the 1980 Census. That was the first time that Latinos played a 
role in helping the Census Bureau get a more accurate count of the Latino 
population, as well as in promoting it in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1980 Census was the best count ever of Latinos, recording a 61% 
increase in the population, it still missed a sizable chunk. This hard-to-reach 
segment includes illegal immigrants mistrustful of government agencies, the 
homeless and poor families doubled up in apartments or living in garages or 
other unconventional housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we make a concerted effort to inform our community about the importance 
of the census . . . many people will be left out," Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Census is expected to show an increase of more than 5 million Latinos 
nationwide, for a total of nearly 20 million, according to various estimates. 
About 1.3 million of that increase is expected to occur in Los Angeles County, 
where Latinos are projected to become one-third of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Reapportionment based on the 1980 Census is credited with a doubling of Latinos 
in Congress and the election of hundreds of Latino officials across the 
country. The 1990 Census holds even greater promise for Latinos, according to 
Latino activists and demographers. They say that Latino organizations are 
better prepared than ever to use the new Census figures to gain a more 
equitable share of government funds and political representation.

POLICE KILL 2 MEN, WOUND WOMAN IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In separate shooting incidents, Los Angeles police officers killed a pair of 
suspected car thieves after chasing them into Culver City and critically 
wounded a knife-wielding woman in Hollywood, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An officer was shot in the wrist and a police dog was killed in the Culver City 
incident; a bystander was wounded in the head by a fragment from a police 
bullet in the Hollywood shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Both episodes occurred Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The first began about 9:30 p.m., when Hollywood Division Sgt. Richard Dedmon, 
39, was flagged down by a bail bondsman at Yucca Street and Whitley Avenue, 
police said. As Dedmon and the bondsman spoke, they were approached by 
Catherine Hernandez, 32, who appeared to be drunk, according to police reports. 
Dedmon ordered her to leave, but Hernandez instead pulled out a large folding 
knife and allegedly threatened the officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight Shots Fired 
</P>
<P>
Dedmon called for backup and, when other officers arrived, they shot Hernandez 
with a Taser gun, a device that fires electrically charged darts that 
temporarily incapacitate a person. Hernandez, however, pulled out the darts and 
jumped onto the hood of a parked car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
When she allegedly lunged at Officer Julie Boyer, 30, she, Dedmon and Officer 
Joan Leuck, 29, fired a total of eight rounds, striking Hernandez in the left 
leg, both arms, and the lower back. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was in stable 
condition Thursday afternoon. Hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Hernandez 
sustained eight wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman walking across the street at the time of the shooting, Peggy 
Erickson, 18, was grazed in the left temple by a bullet fragment. She was 
treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City shooting occurred about 11 p.m, two hours after motorcycle 
officers from West Los Angeles chased two suspects in what turned out to be a 
stolen car. The pursuit ended at Washington Boulevard and Bledsoe Avenue in 
Culver City when the car crashed into a curb. 
</P>
<P>
After jumping out of the car, the driver, identified as Jorge Jaramillo, 17, of 
Silver Lake, fired once at officers, missing them, according to police. After 
other officers arrived, a house-by-house search was begun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer, Dog Shot 
</P>
<P>
K-9 Officer John Hall, 41, and his dog, Liberty, were searching a garage in the 
4100 block of Bledsoe Avenue when they were hit by gunfire from a storage room. 
Hall was shot in the right wrist; Liberty, a female Rottweiler, was struck in 
the chest. Although wounded, Hall returned fire and took up another position 
near the front of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Police Department press release, Jaramillo suddenly emerged from 
the storage room and Hall fired several more shots from his 9-millimeter 
pistol, fatally wounding him. 
</P>
<P>
A second K-9 officer, Sgt. Mark Mooring, 38, then sent his German shepherd, 
Friday, into the garage and found another suspect, Amir Abedi, 18, a San 
Fernando Valley resident. When he allegedly pointed a handgun at Mooring, the 
officer fired his pistol three times, killing Abedi. A .22-caliber revolver was 
recovered from the suspect, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall was in good condition at UCLA Medical Center where he was treated for a 
fractured arm. Liberty, who had participated in 250 searches and was credited 
with 103 arrests in two years on the force, died at a local veterinary office. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's shooting was not the first for Mooring and Hall, both 17-year 
veterans of the department, records show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspect Killed 
</P>
<P>
Last June, both officers participated in the killing of a 16-year-old burglary 
suspect, who had fatally shot a rookie police officer minutes earlier. After 
the suspect was found in the attic of a North Hollywood house, Hall and Mooring 
were among four officers who shot the suspect three times in the face when he 
repeatedly tried to reach for a gun, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Two years before that shooting, Hall participated in the hunt for three men who 
had allegedly fired on police officers during a chase. After finding one of the 
suspects hiding in a carport in South-Central Los Angeles, Hall and another 
officer killed him after the suspect allegedly reached for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's shooting was Mooring's fourth since 1985, records show. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1985, he and another K-9 officer confronted a suspected auto 
thief who was hiding under a pickup truck in Van Nuys. After the suspect 
announced, "I ain't going back" and "rapidly moved his left arm" as if to arm 
himself, Mooring and the other officer wounded him in the shoulder, hips and 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, Mooring and his dog attempted to flush a prison escapee from 
the crawl space of a house on Mt. Washington. According to reports, when the 
escapee appeared to reach for a revolver, Mooring fired three rounds at the 
escapee and two other officers fired a total of four shots, killing the 
escapee.

MIURA DENIES PLOTTING TO HAVE WIFE MURDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Japanese businessman denied Thursday in a Tokyo court that he conspired to 
have his wife murdered in Los Angeles eight years ago in order to collect more 
than $750,000 in life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Kazuyoshi Miura, who initially was regarded as a victim when he and his wife 
were shot during what appeared to be a street robbery, has also been charged 
with murder in Los Angeles. But Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said at the time the 
charges were filed last May that Miura will not be prosecuted here if he is 
convicted of murder in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Miura, 41, already is serving a six-year sentence in Japan following his 1987 
conviction for the attempted murder of his wife, Kazumi, in a hammer attack in 
their Los Angeles hotel room in August, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Girlfriend Convicted 
</P>
<P>
Miura's former girlfriend, pornographic film actress Michiko Yazawa, who 
wielded the hammer, was convicted by the Japanese court as an accomplice in 
that attempt and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 18, 1981 -- three months after the unsuccessful murder attempt -- Miura 
and his wife were shot as they walked along 1st Street near the Department of 
Water and Power in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Miura was shot in the leg, but his wife, then 28, lapsed into a coma and died a 
year later in a Japanese hospital after she had been flown home in a U.S. 
military plane. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Miura was seen as an unfortunate tourist victimized by random 
tragedy. He came under suspicion in 1984 when questions about the killing were 
raised in the Japanese news media. 
</P>
<P>
Accused of being the gunman was Yoshikuni Okubo, 36, an Osaka native who 
graduated from USC then became Miura's agent in Los Angeles, buying American 
fashions for export to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conspiracy Alleged 
</P>
<P>
Japanese prosecutors alleged in their letter of indictment filed last November 
that Miura took out a life insurance policy on his wife and then conspired with 
Okubo to kill her because he needed money to cover losses in his importing 
company. 
</P>
<P>
According to his attorney, Yoichi Kitamura, Miura told the Tokyo district court 
on Thursday, "I did not kill nor swindle insurance money at all." 
</P>
<P>
The denial was made during the opening hearing in his trial. The next court 
session in the case will be April 28. 
</P>
<P>
Okubo also denied any involvement in the shooting during the court hearing, the 
defense lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Okubo admitted to the court, however, that he had violated Japanese laws on 
possession of firearms by keeping a rifle from 1982 to 1987, the attorney said.

THREE ARRAIGNED IN DEATH OF INFANT AT LOMITA DAY-CARE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last November, authorities reported that 16-month-old Michele Heasley had died 
after being found comatose at a Lomita day-care home. 
</P>
<P>
In the two weeks that followed the girl's death, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department made some troubling announcements: 
</P>
<P>
The toddler had been strangled. She also had been sexually assaulted. Two other 
children who had been cared for at the home showed physical symptoms of sexual 
molestation. 
</P>
<P>
The case arrived in Torrance Superior Court this week, four months after the 
girl's death, with the arraignment of the home's operators -- Robert and Linda 
Zieger -- and their 19-year-old daughter, Laura. All three pleaded not guilty 
to charges of felony child endangerment and of violating the state Health and 
Safety Code by operating without a license. 
</P>
<P>
They are free on $3,000 bail each. The Ziegers have been ordered by the state 
Department of Social Services to discontinue operation of their day-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty on the charges is six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baffling Case 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they still have not determined exactly what happened at the 
Zieger home on West 262nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have a young child die and you can't show the cause of death, 
it's frustrating," said Sheriff's Lt. Gil Leslie, who is supervising the 
investigation. "We don't have the whole truth yet." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Mike Clark, who represents Robert Zieger, sees the 
4-month delay in filing criminal charges differently. Clark said it shows the 
prosecution's case is weak. 
</P>
<P>
The scope of the case changed last month when the county coroner's office made 
a second examination for sexual abuse and found that Michele Heasley's body 
showed "no evidence of recent or old trauma." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Rod Leonard said the supplementary autopsy shows that the 
initial conclusion that the girl was sexually assaulted was incorrect. That 
aspect of the investigation has been closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the sexual abuse allegation that led to the medical examinations of 
12 other children cared for by the Ziegers, and the finding that two girls 
under the age of 2 had been molested, authorities said. Those findings are 
still valid, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Continues 
</P>
<P>
An official, who asked not to be named, said the Sheriff's Child Abuse Unit is 
still trying to determine who molested the two girls and whether the abuse 
occurred at the day-care home. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, homicide detectives said they are still working on the Heasley case. 
"We are investigating it as a murder until it is proven differently," said Lt. 
Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy showed that the girl died of "ligature" strangulation after a rope 
or cord was wrapped around her neck two or three times. 
</P>
<P>
The only other potential witness in the room with the Heasley girl was another 
infant, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the child endangerment charge "most accurately reflects the offense 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
"This is grossly negligent conduct," Leonard said. "You expect someone to watch 
your child when you take them there, not to put them in another room where they 
can . . . strangle as a result." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Ziegers have hampered the investigation by first presenting 
contradictory accounts of the girl's death and then by refusing to speak to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators' reports, Laura Zieger said she left the Heasley 
girl napping at 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 14 in an upstairs bedroom. Laura said that 
when she returned an hour later, the girl was not breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Zieger, 48, and Linda Zieger, 47, confirmed that account. 
</P>
<P>
But children at the home, including the Ziegers' 12-year-old daughter, said the 
infant was actually found in a downstairs bedroom, a report said. 
</P>
<P>
The children also told investigators that the Ziegers sometimes used "harness 
devices" to tether children to walls, a report said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives who searched the house found neither harnesses nor the "cord-type of 
material" that the coroner said was used to strangle the girl.

MOBIL LOBBIES MORE AS PRESSURE BUILDS IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As pressure builds locally for tighter controls on its Torrance refinery, Mobil 
Oil is looking to state legislators in Sacramento for help. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil has stepped up its lobbying efforts at the state Capitol in the three 
months since an initiative campaign was launched in Torrance to force an end to 
the use of acutely toxic hydrofluoric acid at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
An excess of the lethal chemical in a refinery unit that produces unleaded 
gasoline caused a thunderous explosion and two-day fire at the sprawling 
refinery in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Danger 
</P>
<P>
Although the release of a small amount of the chemical caused no injuries, the 
explosion focused attention on the potential danger to the community posed by 
its use. In sufficient quantities, hydrofluoric acid forms a ground-hugging 
cloud that can be deadly to all exposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
Since the explosion, Mobil has nearly tripled its annual political 
contributions to state legislators, according to reports filed with the 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
In recent meetings with state lawmakers and legislative aides, Mobil lobbyists 
and officials have expressed concern that the Torrance initiative could 
threaten their refinery operations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are really trying to do is protect our investment here," Mobil 
refinery manager Wyman D. Robb said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
A legislative aide who met with Mobil lobbyists said: "These people seem to be 
legitimately frightened that their major Southern California refinery could be 
shut down. . . . Their motives are to save their facility." 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance refinery, one of the largest in the state, supplies 12% of 
Southern California's gasoline. It uses hydrofluoric acid to boost the octane 
of gasoline, and Mobil has estimated that it would cost $100 million to switch 
to sulfuric acid, the catalyst used by most other major refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mobil has yet to seek legislation to preempt the city of Torrance from 
regulating hydrofluoric acid, lawmakers, legislative aides and Mobil 
representatives said that is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked to them about various legislative ideas," Robb said. "There are a 
lot of options that we've discussed." He said that preempting the initiative is 
"something we might want to explore further with them." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil is concerned that local regulation of toxic chemicals such as 
hydrofluoric acid is inconsistent with state controls, Robb said. "When cities 
get into this, that takes away some of the conformity and consistency that 
probably should be in place for the whole state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The local initiative, sponsored by Torrance Councilman Dan Walker, would 
severely limit the storage of hydrofluoric acid at Mobil and any industrial 
site in the city, effectively forcing the refinery to abandon use of the 
chemical. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Risk to Public 
</P>
<P>
A Mobil-financed study released last week said use of the acid poses almost no 
risk to the public. Consultants who prepared the report estimated that the risk 
posed by continued use of the chemical at the Torrance refinery is 1.21 
fatalities per 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Walker disputes that conclusion, and the City Council this week voted 
unanimously to hire its own consultant to analyze the Mobil consultants' work. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only one sure way to prevent a catastrophe and that's to eliminate 
the threat," Walker said. "The only way to eliminate the threat is to eliminate 
the storage of significant quantities" of hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said he soon will begin gathering signatures on the initiative, and he 
predicted that "the people of this community are going to tell Mobil Oil that 
there are going to be some changes made." 
</P>
<P>
Former Torrance City Atty. Stanley E. Remelmeyer, in a report to the City 
Council, said there is no state or federal legislation that preempts Torrance 
from regulating hydrofluoric acid, although the Legislature or Congress could 
pass such a bill. 
</P>
<P>
"One would expect that, if cities and counties start passing ordinances 
concerning hydrofluoric acid, then the oil companies would go to the 
Legislature to get it preempted," Remelmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said he would not "go public" with Mobil's strategy for opposing the 
Torrance initiative. But interviews with lawmakers and legislative aides 
indicate that preemptive legislation is likely to be a part of that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) said Mobil representatives 
discussed their concerns about the initiative, but did not ask him to author 
preemptive legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe they would find a legislator that would do that," said 
Felando, whose district includes the refinery. "Mobil Oil needs to get in there 
and clean up their own act. If they had been paying more attention to their 
plant and safety, they wouldn't be in the predicament they are in." 
</P>
<P>
The November, 1987, blast was one of a series of explosions, fires and 
accidents that claimed three lives and caused a dozen serious injuries at the 
refinery in the last two years. The latest accident occurred Tuesday, when two 
Mobil maintenance workers were seriously burned and a third suffered minor 
injuries when hot oil and steam shot from a pipe they were working on. 
</P>
<P>
Felando said the oil company "ought to be doing something to alleviate (public) 
concerns, so people aren't living in fear." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil also has met in the past several months with other South Bay legislators, 
including Sens. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) and Ralph C. Dills 
(D-Gardena), and Assemblymen Dave Elder (D-San Pedro) and Richard E. Floyd 
(D-Carson). 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, whose district includes the refinery, said he would not be inclined to 
carry preemptive legislation. "On local land use matters," he said, "I don't 
think that Sacramento ought to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd is also dubious. "We are not giving them a way out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Legislature's two committees on toxic substances, 
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park) and Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles), said they were contacted by Mobil lobbyists in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner, who chairs the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials 
Committee, said Mobil representatives mentioned the initiative. "They were 
saying they had concerns," she said, but they did not request legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said his staff has met with Mobil representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil lobbyist Fred Taugher did not return telephone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Robb, who said he has made one trip to Sacramento to meet with legislators, 
said: "There is nothing mysterious or secret about what we did up there. We 
talked to our legislators just like any other business or industry." 
</P>
<P>
But legislative aides, who deal regularly with industry lobbyists, said Mobil 
lately has been trying to raise its profile in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike Chevron or Arco, Mobil has never had a strong presence up here," a 
legislative consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
The increased lobbying comes in spite of the fact that Mobil has been reducing 
its presence on the West Coast. With the sale last year of a refinery in 
Ferndale, Wash., the Torrance facility is Mobil's only refinery on the West 
Coast. The company also has sold its Northern California service stations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Contributions 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contribution reports show Mobil has nearly tripled its political 
contributions since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That year, Mobil's California political action committee gave $24,450 to 
legislative candidates. The only contributions to South Bay legislators 
included a $400 check to Felando and $800 to Dills. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil also spent $190,000 in an unsuccessful effort to prevent passage of 
Proposition 65, the toxics-control initiative on the November, 1986, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Mobil made a single $500 contribution until Dec. 23 -- less than a 
month after the Torrance explosion -- when the company sent out $35,350 in 
checks to 43 incumbent legislators. Mobil gave $2,000 to Dills, $1,000 to 
Beverly, and $500 each to Elder, Floyd and Felando in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mobil gave $71,000 to legislative candidates and two Los Angeles 
city officials. Mobil sent $1,000 checks to Dills, Beverly, Elder and Felando, 
and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. Checks for $500 were sent to Floyd, Sen. 
Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) and Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Elder returned the money four months later. "Sending the money back should have 
told them that, at least in this legislator's mind, accepting a contribution 
would not be appropriate and that in my view they are not good corporate 
citizens," Elder said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Mobil dramatically increased its political contributions, Robb said: 
"Our PAC has recognized the importance of California. We probably are behind 
other industries and oil companies."

SCHOOL THROWS IN TOWEL ON SAVING GYM; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER 6 MONTHS' WORK, ONLY WAY TO REMOVE ASBESTOS IS TO RAZE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only gymnasium for school children on Santa Catalina Island contains so 
much asbestos that it cannot be made safe, officials have decided, so it is 
being torn down. 
</P>
<P>
For six months, workers from the mainland had been removing the carcinogenic 
material, used for fireproofing and insulation. Then officials from the Long 
Beach Unified School District and the California Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration concluded that there was so much asbestos behind the building's 
walls and ceilings and beneath the floor that it could never be removed 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the gym started coming down. 
</P>
<P>
Enshrouded in plastic to prevent asbestos dust from escaping, the free-standing 
corrugated-steel building is being razed by a demolition crew. The district 
spent $400,000 to remove the asbestos and expects to spend another $200,000 on 
the demolition, said district spokesman Richard Van Der Laan. Avalon residents 
have watched the gym's destruction with regret and nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
"In our small community, there are an awful lot of residents who had memorable 
moments in that gym," said Jon Meyer, principal of Avalon's four schools. "The 
attitude is one of sad resignation." 
</P>
<P>
The building has been "kind of a landmark in Avalon for a number of years," 
Meyer said. It was donated to the school district in the 1950s by the Wrigley 
chewing gum family. 
</P>
<P>
Since asbestos removal closed the gym, basketball games have been played in the 
ballroom of the city's ornate Casino. Assemblies have been held in shifts in 
the school's 185-seat auditorium or on the baseball field. Graduation 
ceremonies, usually held in the gym, will be held in the ballroom's auditorium 
until a new gym is built, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But prospects for a new gym are uncertain, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The school district is facing a budget deficit and doesn't have the money to 
build a gym at Avalon, Van Der Laan said. There are no plans or cost estimates 
for a new gym, but the district is applying for funding from the State Board of 
Education, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An architect will visit the school grounds next week as a preliminary step 
toward drawing up plans for a gym, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to raze the present gym was based on the recommendations of a 
private asbestos abatement company and an independent laboratory, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing the gym's airborne asbestos level to the federally accepted standards 
of one fiber per cubic centimeter or less was "technically impossible" in the 
old, poorly constructed building, said Ron Tessada, maintenance director for 
the school district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complete Removal Impossible 
</P>
<P>
The substance was "all over the building, and even under the building," Tessada 
said. "We would have had to cut holes in the hardwood floor and vacuum it out." 
</P>
<P>
Removal was especially frustrating because areas full of asbestos were 
continually being found, often in parts of the gym the cleanup crew could not 
reach, Tessada said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real bear for us," Tessada said. The district has incurred a 
"horrible" expense in its efforts to get the asbestos out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the $600,000 cost was the expense of shipping asbestos-removal 
equipment back and forth to the island by barge, Tessada said. Other expenses 
included housing the five-member removal crew in a $1,000-a-month Avalon 
condominium for six months to avoid daily commuting to Catalina. Debris from 
the demolished building will have to be shipped to a toxic waste site near 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
But the district is hoping to defray part of the cost with money provided by 
Proposition 79, the $800-million School Facilities Bond Act passed last 
November, Van Der Laan said. 
</P>
<P>
The act set aside $100 million for "identification, assessment and abatement of 
hazardous asbestos materials" in the state's schools. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has applied for reimbursement of the entire cost of 
removing the asbestos, as well as 75% of the cost of tearing down the building, 
Van Der Laan said. 
</P>
<P>
David Zian, a school facilities program analyst with the state's Lease-Purchase 
Asbestos Abatement program in Sacramento, said the district is eligible under 
Proposition 79 for reimbursement of 75% of the demolition costs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the State Allocation Board has not decided whether to reimburse the 
district for the cost of removing the asbestos, Zian said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the absence of a gym has taken a toll on student life, parents, 
teachers and students said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 1 School Dance 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Vojkovich, 16, said there has been only one school dance this year, 
instead of the usual five or six. "It's a bummer, kids are really depressed," 
said Vojkovich, who is a junior. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a gym has left some student athletes with "not very much to do 
anymore," said Terry Stonier, a 16-year-old junior. 
</P>
<P>
Vojkovich and Stonier, both members of the girls' basketball team, said they 
may quit the team if there is no place to play home games. Otherwise, they 
would have to make as many as 10 trips to the mainland next season. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon teams must take a boat and a bus to get to such games, and stay 
overnight in a hotel. Usually there are about four such trips a year, and the 
teams usually play two games per trip. Road trips are tiring, students said, as 
well as expensive because they must pay for their own meals. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Santa Catalina Island Co. allowed the school to use the Casino 
ballroom for home basketball games this year, the ballroom is being renovated 
for the Casino's 60th anniversary and will be unavailable next year, said 
company spokesman Ron Doutt. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's not the school's fault," Vojkovich said. "I know it takes a long 
time to get money (for a new gym), but it's just not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Tanya's mother, Carol Vojkovich, said many parents are upset over the loss of 
the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's all the school district's money going, if they can't have a new gym?" 
she asked. "The kids have nothing else to do. That's what the boys and girls 
look forward to during the winter, that's the only sport."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County health officials said Thursday they plan to start a special mosquito 
eradication program in parts of Oceanside after a report last week that a 
migrant farm worker had malaria. 
</P>
<P>
Indications are that the farm worker, who has recovered, was infected with the 
disease outside the county, but officials want to take extra precautions here 
and have begun fogging sections of northeast Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking this action because traps, which we set immediately after the 
case was reported, caught a sufficient number of the mosquitoes capable of 
carrying the disease," said Larry Aker, the county's assistant deputy director 
for environmental health services. 
</P>
<P>
Aker said that, because only one of the 24 mosquito species in the county is 
capable of carrying the disease, "it is unlikely that a person bitten by a 
mosquito would come down with malaria." 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified farm worker had been sleeping outside near the San Luis Rey 
River and had worked in other counties before coming to the Oceanside area, 
said county health services spokeswoman Elaine Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of malaria include high fever and chills. 
</P>
<P>
Moise Mizrahi, chief of the county's vector control division, said the case is 
"not an outbreak" of malaria. 
</P>
<P>
The northeastern areas of Oceanside are scheduled to be fogged through Saturday 
with insecticide that is considered harmless to humans, though some people may 
have allergic reactions, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
People in the area are advised to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, 
especially at night when mosquitoes are most active, to avoid getting bitten.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: SAVORING NORTH ITALIAN CUISINE IN NORTH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it opened a few years ago, Scalini was particularly attractive as the 
destination of a Sunday drive in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant still looks across Via de la Valle at polo grounds and open 
fields, but the nearby hillsides that formerly grew dun-colored brush and 
sprinklings of wildflowers now sprout expensive housing tracts. In its mood and 
menu, Scalini seems well able to match its neighborhood as the landscape 
becomes progressively more urban. 
</P>
<P>
The place always has been somewhat urbane, especially during the racing season, 
when many of its patrons smelled of thoroughbreds, Kentucky blue grass and the 
Saratoga turf club; in fact, the formality of the dining room and the casual 
tone of the clientele combined to produce a sense of sophistication rarely 
found in these parts. At the time, the menu was pleasantly ahead of itself, and 
if other Italian houses in North County have caught up, Scalini has held its 
own. A couple of recent visits turned up cooking that was consistently 
well-prepared and well-presented. 
</P>
<P>
The common denominator that unites the disparate styles and elements of Italian 
cookery is garlic, and if one enters on a busy night it is the scent of garlic 
sizzling in olive oil that forms a first and lasting impression of Scalini. 
Most of the entrees, which are relatively restrained and "northern" in their 
approach, avoid garlic, but first courses and pastas are transformed by an 
almost abandoned use of it. 
</P>
<P>
A primary example of the way garlic can change the direction of a dish is the 
penne all'arrabiata ("raging" pasta). This is a common Italian presentation of 
tube-shaped macaroni tossed with a lightly cooked tomato sauce spiked with bits 
of hot red pepper. A little garlic usually seasons the sauce, but Scalini 
throws in a large spoonful of coarsely chopped, raw garlic, which supplies a 
sensation of heat quite different from that touched off by the peppers. The 
result is delicious, with the only caveat that the penne may not make the best 
prelude to a social situation. 
</P>
<P>
The antipasto table also includes tidbits that sigh with garlic's heavy breath. 
Especially notable here are the the slices of eggplant and zucchini that have 
been grilled, then marinated in olive oil. Topped with slivers of strong, musky 
Parmesan, these vegetables make particularly savory mouthfuls. The buffet 
usually offers six or seven items -- sliced tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and 
basil leaves, a cloying chicken salad in homemade mayonnaise, excellent 
marinated olives, a cold compote of chick peas and tuna -- and a little of each 
will be included on the antipasto plate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elegant Pizzas 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen puts a great deal of emphasis on starters, and, in addition to the 
cold antipasti, it turns out sauteed shrimp finished in the arrabiata style; 
puff pastry filled with shellfish in a creamed tomato sauce; snails served in a 
fashion similar to the "bourguignon" style that turns up on so many menus, but 
here with the addition of mixed herbs, and steamed mussels in a broth flavored 
with herbs, garlic and tomato. 
</P>
<P>
Four rather elegant pizzas make prime candidates to be shared as first courses, 
but because the restaurant often serves a round of dough topped with olive oil, 
garlic, salt and basil as a snack while guests read the menu, the pizzas can 
seem rather beside the point. Nonetheless, it is an impressive selection that 
begins with the Margherita (according to Neapolitans, the one true pizza), a 
pie topped simply with tomato, mozzarella, basil and oregano. More elaborate 
versions include the "moskovskaya," a theoretically Russian variation topped 
with cream cheese, smoked salmon and caviar, and the house special, which 
combines sun-dried tomatoes with cheese and sweet peppers. 
</P>
<P>
The pasta list perhaps takes itself too seriously because it excludes the 
simple, classic sauce of quickly cooked tomatoes seasoned with nothing more 
than a little basil and salt. Spaghetti or vermicelli topped with a bit of this 
at times seems the perfect kickoff to an Italian meal, and it is a little 
surprising to not find it on an otherwise far-ranging menu. 
</P>
<P>
There is a close cousin to it, though, the capelini Santa Margherita, or thin 
pasta tossed with chopped raw tomato, basil, mozzarella and garlic. There is a 
pleasing lightness to this dish, even though it is rather substantial. The 
pasta mood grows racy with the fusilli alla Mediterranea, or twists in a spicy 
sauce of sausage, cured black olives, tomato and seasonings, and mellow with 
the elegantly restrained ravioli boscaiola, which swim in a tomatoed cream 
sauce filled out with porcini mushrooms and bits of Italian pancetta bacon. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees definitely take the tone identified these days as "Northern Italian," 
but, despite the general restraint there are plenty of such typical accents as 
lemon, rosemary and other strong herbs and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
Grilled fresh salmon arrives in dill sauce, grilled swordfish with capers and 
lemon butter and sauteed scallops in a sauce of grain mustard and cream, and 
any of these preparations would be equally at home in a French restaurant. More 
specifically Italian are the excellent grilled lamb chops, beautifully crusted 
and redolent of rosemary and garlic; the sea bass amalfitana, finished with a 
fresh tomato sauce, olives and basil, and the veal scallops in a choice of 
lemon butter or Marsala sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting-sounding veal dish, the vitello Scalini, was one of the 
kitchen's less successful offerings, because it featured a gravy-like sauce 
that appeared to have been thickened with flour, something generally not done 
in Italian sautes. It also went shy on an advertised component, eggplant, 
offering only a tiny scrap of it under the coverlet of prosciutto melted 
fontina cheese that draped the sauteed veal scallops. 
</P>
<P>
The menu closes extravagantly with lobster fra diavola, a spicy dish that 
includes a brandy flambe in its preparation, and with the interesting hybrid 
called filetto Rossini. The Italians claim this decidedly French combination of 
grilled beef filet, foie gras, truffles and brown sauce as their own, because 
it was the notorious favorite of composer Giacomo Rossini. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert tray is the one perfunctory presentation of the meal. It includes 
profiteroles, the French dessert of ice cream-stuffed cream puffs, and 
tiramisu, the very Roman dessert of whipped mascarpone cheese, flavored here 
with powdered espresso. It is creamy, but not very exciting.

HEAD OF NAVY HOSPITAL GETS NEW POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commander of the Long Beach Naval Hospital is being transferred, but Navy 
officials said last week that the move is not related to recent claims that the 
facility has been dangerously under-equipped. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Clarence William Cote', commanding officer since 1987, will leave 
May 19 to assume command of the Naval Hospital Corps School in Great Lakes, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a regular change of command," said Ensign Richard Dewey, a hospital 
spokesman. "It's a step up in his career." 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, Dewey said, it was unclear who would replace Cote'. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the 114-bed facility -- the only Naval hospital in Los 
Angeles County -- made headlines after a group of physicians in its internal 
medicine department signed a memo saying they would refuse to treat seriously 
ill patients because of conditions at the facility, which they considered 
poorly equipped and under-staffed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dewey, the commander's imminent reassignment is unrelated to those 
revelations.

Sensing victory, the San Pedro right fielder drilled a one-out double to right 
that scored Brian Schiazzano and lifted the host Pirates to a 9-8 Pacific 
League victory over Banning on Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Banning right-hander Mike Busby's first two fastballs had Miller behind 0-2 in 
the count, but he hung a high curve on the next pitch and Miller poked it into 
right center and Schiazzano galloped home with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had to come through," said Miller, who was 0 for 7 in two games against 
Banning to that point and helped Banning score two runs in the sixth when he 
slipped and let Jimmy Gonzalez's hit roll to the fence for a triple. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a strong feeling he'd be throwing me a curve and I choked up on the bat 
and put my mind on hitting the ball." 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro improved to 3-1 in league play and 5-4 overall, while Banning fell to 
3-1 and 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates jumped to a 3-0 first-inning lead and led 4-1 after three innings 
before Banning started chipping away. The Pilots scored two runs in each of the 
fourth, fifth and sixth innings, and their solo run in the top of the seventh 
gave them a short-lived advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Jesse Espinoza drove in Eric Fierro with a fielder's choice in the 
third, and Busby's two-run homer to left pulled Banning's to 4-3 in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots claimed the lead the next inning when San Pedro pitcher Gerard 
Castenada threw wildly to third base on Gonzalez's bunt, allowing Julian Pardo 
to score. One out later Ralph Nuno singled home Espinoza. 
</P>
<P>
Two runs in the sixth allowed Banning to take a 7-4 lead. The Pilots had two 
men on when Gonzalez hit a soft fly down the right-field line. Miller ran it 
down but slipped before he reached the ball and it bounded away as Espinoza and 
Raul Diaz crossed the plate easily. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro climbed back with a four-run sixth that began with singles by 
Schiazzano and Matt Rasband. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez replaced Busby after Schiazzano's hit but was ineffective. After 
Rasband's single, he induced Miller to fly to deep right but walked the next 
three batters, one intentionally, as San Pedro tied the game, 7-7. Busby came 
in again, this time in relief, but the first man he faced, Glenn Merrick, drove 
home Castenada with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Banning wasted no time tying the game in the top of the seventh. Busby's double 
to the base of the left field wall scored Chico Limas, who had opened the frame 
with a sharp single. Fierro then walked. Eric Boysen relieved Castenada and 
recorded the final two outs of the inning to leave the game tied, 8-8, going 
into the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week Banning beat San Pedro, 5-4, but this time the Pirates had 
the home field advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came in here I felt I'd be happy with a split," said Banning Coach Syl 
Saavedra, who watched his team commit seven errors in the contest. "And when we 
were down three runs, I still thought a split would be OK. 
</P>
<P>
"But we came back and took the lead and then go ahead and lose. No, I'm not 
happy with the split anymore. There's just something about playing at San 
Pedro. Something strange always seems to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Boysen (1-0) earned the win, while Busby was saddled with the loss to fall to 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Banning outhit San Pedro, 12-8, as Fierro, Diaz, Espinoza and Busby knocked out 
two hits apiece. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro catcher Dale Johnson was three for four, and shortstop Ken Stapleton 
collected two hits.

RELEAGUING PLAN CALLS FOR ALEMANY TO LEAVE DEL REY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As recently as last season, three of the Valley-area's most prominent Catholic 
high schools competed together in the Del Rey League. But if a releaguing 
proposal is approved by the Catholic Athletic Assn., Alemany, Crespi and Notre 
Dame will play in three different leagues beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame left the Del Rey and joined the San Fernando Valley League this 
school year. Under the proposal, Alemany would leave the Del Rey and join La 
Puente Bishop Amat, Torrance Bishop Montgomery, Santa Ana Mater Dei, Playa del 
Rey St. Bernard and Santa Fe Springs St. Paul in a six-team league of 
coeducational schools. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi would remain in the Del Rey with St. Francis, Loyola and St. John Bosco. 
Those three would be joined by Bosco Tech and Servite in a six-team league of 
boys-only schools. Neither of the proposed leagues has yet been named. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley League of Bell-Jeff, Chaminade, Harvard, Notre Dame, 
St. Genevieve and La Salle would remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Schools have until March 31 to file objections to the plan. The proposal will 
go before the Catholic Athletic Assn. at a meeting next month. Alemany's 
principal, Father Michael Nocita, said that he probably will not object. He 
wants Alemany to remain in a Division I league and is confident that the 
Indians can compete at that level despite a disappointing showing this school 
year. But he has concerns about travel. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any big problems, except travel time, which is an extreme 
drawback," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi Athletic Director Paul Muff said that his school also will support the 
proposal, saying the chances are good it will pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy with it because it keeps the Del Rey together and we have good 
relationships with those schools," he said. "Of course, we no longer have a 
Valley rival in the league and that's a drawback."

SENIOR CHAE-HO CHONG PROVES EQUALLY ADEPT AT ABSORBING AND DELIVERING KEY BLOWS 
FOR CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only time will tell whether the ultra-aggressive, free-swinging Chae-Ho Chong 
leaves a lasting imprint on the way baseball is played at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Matador baseball, however, already has left an indelible mark on Chong. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, judging from the body bruises and ever-present black eye he seems to 
sport, it has left quite a few. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the broken nose Chong suffered last season after being hit 
by a ball while playing first base against UC Riverside . 
</P>
<P>
Or the hematoma that resulted earlier this season when Chong bunted a ball off 
his right eye during practice. 
</P>
<P>
Those are just two of the more sanguinary shots that Chong has absorbed since 
arriving at Northridge by way of Chatsworth High, Arizona State and Valley 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Call him the Say Hey Kid. As in "Hey, watch out!" 
</P>
<P>
"Chae always seems to find the bad hop that goes right to his face," said Mark 
Morton, a Northridge assistant. "He's the kind of guy that has to play really 
aggressive. When he tones it down, he tends not to play the way he's capable." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, be it behind the plate as a catcher, playing first base or winding up 
for a swing in the batter's box, Chong has the ability to shine. 
</P>
<P>
And no matter where he goes, a shiner is an almost certain souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I'm carrying a bull's-eye on my head," Chong said this week 
before Northridge played University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
After batting .387 overall and .407 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
play last season, Chong is also searching for the answer to some 
uncharacteristic difficulties at the plate that have resulted in a .264 
average. 
</P>
<P>
A turnaround by Chong would be welcomed by Northridge (13-8-1, 5-6-1 in 
conference play), which is ranked 12th in Division II and travels to Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo (14-11, 5-3) today for an important two-game series with the 
eighth-ranked and conference-leading Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always dangerous," UC Riverside Coach Jack Smitheran said of Chong. "He's 
a competitor who can really hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
With the bat or on the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-11 and a sinewy 195 pounds, Chong, 21, looks the part of a bruiser. 
</P>
<P>
"He's built like a rock," Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano said. "He's the kind of 
guy you want by your side when you're walking in a dark alley." 
</P>
<P>
But sitting in the bleachers behind home plate at Matador Field, Chong does not 
come off as menacing in aviator sunglasses, a CSUN baseball T-shirt and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three boys -- Jason, a freshman catcher at Northridge, and Kevin, 
a senior outfielder at Chatsworth -- Chae-Ho (pronounced CHAY-ho) resisted 
adopting a Western name to preserve his South Korean identity. His name, 
roughly translated, means "a ball in the summer sky." 
</P>
<P>
As he reflects upon his upbringing in South Korea and his desire to help Korean 
immigrants gain the same opportunities he has enjoyed, it is difficult to 
picture him the brute. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of kids in the Korean community who are abandoned, who are not 
living the life that I'm living right now," he said. "I'd like to get these 
kids together and form a team . . . and help them." 
</P>
<P>
Chong was an aggressive child -- "like a bull in a china shop" -- while growing 
up about 30 miles outside Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's just in my personality," he said. "I'm always feisty." 
</P>
<P>
His fondness for physical contact, he said, did not lessen when his family 
moved to the Koreatown section of downtown Los Angeles when he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have had a short temper," said Chong, whose family moved to 
Chatsworth in 1980. "That's been the biggest problem. Ever since I was little, 
my dad noticed it and was telling me, 'One of these days,' it's going to catch 
up with me and it's going to hurt me. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like every time I get into problems, that's been the case." 
</P>
<P>
Chong said that his temper hampered him at Arizona State where he enrolled 
after batting .406 as a senior at Chatsworth and being drafted by the Baltimore 
Orioles in the 36th round of the 1985 draft. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the talented freshmen that Arizona State recruits each year, Chong 
played for the Sun Devils' junior varsity throughout much of the fall and 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
After months of keeping his emotions in check, Chong's temper flared when he 
made the last out of a loss to Scottsdale Community College in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Our JV team was pretty cocky, so they (Scottsdale players) were all over me," 
Chong said. "I ended up taking on the whole team, trying to fight with them. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day, I came out to play and the JV coach said (Arizona State Coach 
Jim) Brock didn't want me around anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Chong stayed in school and was taken back into the program later in the season. 
He played in the final varsity series against Arizona and collected one hit in 
four at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
That was his season -- and career -- as a Sun Devil. 
</P>
<P>
Chong returned to Tempe for his sophomore year, discovered three junior college 
catchers had been recruited and transferred to Valley for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
Chong batted .321 for Valley in 1987 and transferred to Northridge in January, 
1988, after completing his associate of arts degree. 
</P>
<P>
As he shoots for a strong finish to his collegiate career and a chance at 
professional baseball, Chong said that he has his emotions under control. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working hard to control my temper," Chong said. "I'm always conscious 
about it. I've learned from my mistakes."

LOYOLA'S STRUGGLING SURICO FINDS STUFF AND STOPS UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a tough spring for Steve Surico. After nine rough outings over the 
last two months, Surico has gone from Loyola Marymount's pitching ace to a 
symbol of the team's early struggles. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, however, Surico was a mirror of his old form. He allowed 
only four hits and struck out eight in seven innings in Loyola's 5-2 victory 
over Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The strong outing takes some of the sting out of Surico's swollen 8.64 
earned-run average. Surico's record improved to 2-4, and while that's a far cry 
from the 12-2 mark the big left-hander posted last year as a sophomore, it's a 
beginning. Surico also helped the Lions creep closer to the .500 mark, bringing 
the team's record to 13-14. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I finally started figuring it out today," Surico said. "My confidence 
level hasn't been very high. Earlier, I figured it would all just happen like 
it did last year. But it didn't happen. You've got to go out and do it 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Surico led Loyola's staff in wins and strikeouts (89 in 97 innings). 
For Surico, it just happened in big wins over UCLA, USC, California and Arizona 
State. Then Surico made it happen again in a key victory against Arkansas in 
the NCAA Midwest Regional at Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
But this year the only place Surico has been happening is out of the strike 
zone. Going into Thursday's game, he had surrendered 21 walks in 25 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Against Utah he seemed to solve the mystery of his vanishing control. For the 
first time this year Surico made it through a start without giving up a walk. 
Most of his strikeouts came on big curves breaking through the strike zone into 
the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't been close with my curve ball in any of my outings until today," 
Surico said. "Today was a good place to try to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
Surico's breaking ball was so sharp Thursday that it cost him a run. 
</P>
<P>
Utah second baseman Mike Aranzullo was on third with two out in the fifth 
inning when Surico broke off a big curve to Utah's Travis Hansen that exploded 
in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen missed the pitch by about two feet, but unfortunately so did Loyola 
catcher Miah Bradbury. The ball kicked up out of the dirt into Bradbury's chest 
protector, and when it rolled away, Aranzullo sprinted home on the wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Utah had gotten an unearned run in the fourth when Hansen scored after throwing 
errors by shortstop Darrel Deak and Surico and a sacrifice fly by the Utes' Rob 
Beck. 
</P>
<P>
Despite racking up 10 hits, Loyola struggled offensively. The Lions took a 2-1 
lead in the fourth on a pair of unlikely runs. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Rick Allen, a .413 hitter coming off a two-home run performance in 
Monday's doubleheader against the University of San Francisco, started the 
inning by tapping out a 30-foot infield single that neither Utah pitcher Mark 
Nilson nor third baseman Hansen could handle. Then Greg Wall and Bradbury -- 
both behind in the count -- delivered back-to-back RBI doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions scored three runs in the seventh on a two-run double by Wall and 
Deak's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman right-hander Joe Caruso pitched the final two innings in relief of 
Surico, striking out two, and Deak and Kevin Van De Brake turned a slick 6-4-3 
double play to close out the game.

College of the Canyons loaded the bases with none out in each of the first two 
innings but failed to score and went on to lose to Cerritos, 12-4, in the 
second round of the Allan Hancock baseball tournament in Santa Maria on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who left 15 men on base Wednesday, stranded 12 against Cerritos. 
Randy Cooper led off with a solo home run for Canyons and Gary Morgan had two

the ninth on Matt Arnold's fielder's choice with the bases loaded and a 
run-scoring single by Greg Struhl. Mark Cavaretta was three for four and E. J. 
Pape had two hits and two RBIs for Valley. Tim DeGrasse (6-0) earned the

CLEVELAND COACH STABLE AFTER SUFFERING HEART PALPITATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
Cleveland High baseball Coach Ray Todd is expected to be released from Westlake 
Medical Center today after suffering heart palpitations after Wednesday's 12-12 
North Valley League tie with San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Todd, 55, who underwent bypass surgery three years ago, was taken to the 
hospital late Wednesday evening by his wife Janet. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland assistant Marty Siegel said that Todd complained of a rapid heartbeat 
minutes after the game was called because of darkness at approximately 6:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Todd spent two days in intensive care and was listed in stable condition 
Thursday night, Janet Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been fine all day," she said Thursday night. "We expect him home (today), 
maybe by noon." 
</P>
<P>
With Todd sidelined, Cleveland lost its first game of the season, 9-7, in a 
rematch at San Fernando on Thursday. STEVE ELLING

SPRING FEVER STRIKES LOCAL SURFACE FISH

<P>
Spring brings warmer ocean water and the return to surface game fishing action. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Island provided excellent fishing last week. 
</P>
<P>
Casting with light tackle aboard the Outerlimits from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing, 
six anglers were catching calico bass with squid and anchovies when the action 
got frenzied. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of white sea bass came up slashing the bait and busting tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Smoten of West Los Angeles landed the first, which weighed 14 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Chase of San Pedro had to bring his out of the kelp and landed a 
12-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Ingle of Long Beach went from the stern to the bow in a 20-minute fight to 
keep his fish off the anchor line. It weighed 16 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Carpenter of San Pedro caught two. He bounced a 12 1/4-pounder to the 
deck, rebaited in a hurry and brought to gaff a 17-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
The catch of the sea bass trip was a whopping 22-pounder by Gardena angler 
Darty Cronin using a Mo Jo jig. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th annual Marina del Rey Halibut Derby was a huge success. With 1,200 
anglers bringing in 195 halibut, the largest was caught at Big Rock by Don 
Crisp of Lancaster. He won a trip for two to Australia with his 42 1/2-pounder. 
Ray Hansen of San Pedro won second place with a 25 1/4-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The barge Isle of Redondo is now operating daily and has been relocated on the 
sunken Sacramento Barge in Redondo Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Armstrong of Redondo Sportfishing reports that salmon have been around the 
barge and a possible salmon run could be coming. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a grunion grabber and missed the first runs, a second four-night run 
ends Sunday. This is the last run until June. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: John Van Stone of Santa Monica, fishing aboard his boat the 
Bold Affair off Sunset Beach, caught the whopper of the week when he lowered 
his net to bring aboard a 38-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Lang of Long Beach, aboard the Southern Cal at Catalina Island, won the 
jackpot with a 29-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Juba Wallace of Inglewood, aboard the Redondo Special at Twin Roads, won the 
jackpot with a 20-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Larson of Long Beach, fishing at the 150 Spot aboard the Hitless Miss, 
won the jackpot with his 18 3/4-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Martin of Hermosa Beach, fishing aboard the Redondo Special at Torrance 
Beach, caught an 18 1/2-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Tosh Okamoto of Long Beach, on the Southern Cal at Catalina, won the jackpot 
with his 18-pound lingcod.

S. J. DIAMOND: 'NATURAL' FOODS MAY NOT LIVE UP TO LABEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not satisfied with plenty, Americans want food pure and perfect -- unblemished 
but untreated, plump but not artificially fattened. It should be absolutely 
natural -- just as it came from nature -- but low in salt, cholesterol and 
saturated fat, and high in fiber and vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
Ever responsive, food manufacturers give us goods billed as natural, organic, 
no-sodium, low-cal, even "lite." Quickly queuing up along the cutting edge of 
science, they now provide more calcium and less saturated fat, eager to tell us 
right on the front of the label how they're helping to prevent osteoporosis and 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, front and back of the label may not gibe: Sometimes one giveth 
health and the other taketh away. A "no cholesterol" shortening may list among 
its ingredients saturated fats that spur our cholesterol production. The 
low-fat soup promising reduced risk of heart disease also increases that risk 
with its high, blood pressure-raising salt content. 
</P>
<P>
The question is how best to protect the public against such abuses of its 
trust. Alternatively, one might question whether these are abuses and whether 
the public still has much trust and, therefore, needs outside protection. 
</P>
<P>
Take the "natural" foods, with their connotation of something presented as it 
was constituted in nature, unadulterated. Used with foods, "natural" also 
implies good and healthy: Bread mold and crude oil are also natural, but 
neither is desirable in a diet. Only the Agriculture Department is more 
specific about the word as applied to the meat and poultry products it 
regulates: They can't contain added color or artificial ingredients and must be 
"minimally processed" -- frozen, dried, perhaps cut up for packaging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Stretch Definition 
</P>
<P>
Some foods' ingredients clearly justify the label. Laura Scudder's All Natural 
Peanut Butter contains "Just peanuts . . . that's all!" Miller's 100% Natural 
Unprocessed Bran has one ingredient: 100% unprocessed red wheat bran. Bigelow 
Herbal Garden All Natural Cinnamon Orange Herb Tea has multiple ingredients, 
all patently natural: cinnamon, hibiscus flowers, apples, rose hips, orange 
peel, malted barley, natural flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Other food labels seem to stretch or contract the word's connotation. "Natural" 
may mean that all the ingredients, technically speaking, are found in nature. 
"Natural" yogurts, far from being just cultured milk and a flavoring, may 
include sugar, corn sweetener, modified food starch, gelatin, eggs, turmeric 
(All Natural Johnston's), or cream, tapioca and pectin (Mountain High Natural 
Yogurt), and the "natural" fruit (this in "V. S. Very Special All Natural 
Nonfat Yogurt") is only fruit-like, as in "Peach (corn syrup, peaches, modified 
food starch, natural flavors, citric acid, annato, turmeric)." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes impressive percentages, ultimately nonsense, imply even greater 
naturalness. Capri Sun's 100% Natural Orange beverage, for example, is actually 
only 10% orange juice, its contents water, high-fructose corn sweetener, 
concentrated orange juice, citric acid and natural orange flavor. Similarly, 
Nabisco's 100% Bran cereal contains "100% Wheat Bran," sugar, malted barley 
flour, salt, fig juice and prune juice (the juices elsewhere described as 
"naturally sweet" despite the added sugar). 
</P>
<P>
More absurdly, Aunt Jemima's Butter Lite Natural Butter Flavor syrup "Contains 
No Butter" but something called "natural butter flavor." Lipton's Naturally 
Decaffeinated tea isn't decaffeinated by nature, but washed in "pure, sparkling 
spring water and effervescence like that found in mineral water and club soda." 
And Natural Brew coffee filters are -- who'd have guessed it? -- "a natural 
brown (paper) that hasn't been bleached white." 
</P>
<P>
Some of these labels do seem like false advertising on their front, but there's 
nothing secret: Anyone with two eyes can see the facts on the back. When 
consumers can self-protect, do they still require government help, regulatory 
or legislative? 
</P>
<P>
Reading fine print takes time, of course. "We don't deserve this. We work an 
honest day, and we want an honest deal," says Bruce Silverglade, director of 
legal affairs for the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, 
which urges more comprehensive regulation of food labeling and deceptive 
claims. "The law traditionally has recognized that you can't correct a headline 
in small print," he adds, "and you can't correct the front of a label with the 
back of a label." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "natural" claims are comparatively easy for consumers to evaluate. Other 
claims seem more difficult -- how many calories qualifies as "low calorie"? How 
lean is "lean" meat? -- and the Food and Drug Administration or Agriculture 
Department set standards to which manufacturers must conform in making such 
claims. There are regulations covering sodium (e.g. "sodium-free" means less 
than 5 mg. per serving), calories (e.g. "low calorie" means less than 40 
calories per serving) and leanness of meat, and proposed regulations covering 
cholesterol content. 
</P>
<P>
They may also regulate "disease-prevention claims" -- "statements that relate a 
nutrient to a disease or the prevention of a disease," says Elizabeth Campbell, 
chief of the FDA's regulations and industry activities branch. At the moment, 
such claims (high fiber prevents cancer, low cholesterol prevents heart 
disease) would make the food subject to the FDA's drug clearance rules, but the 
agency wants to make it possible for food labels to educate the public about 
such discoveries. "The science is growing up so fast the FDA can't just say 'We 
don't believe that,' " says Lillie Taylor, FDA supervisory consumer safety 
officer. "We don't want to deny something that might be useful to people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
So with a lot of advice and pressure, the regulators are working up guidelines 
that would permit such "educational" labeling while avoiding its problems -- 
the difficulty of determining scientific consensus behind each claim, of 
keeping manufacturers from touting the health benefit of one ingredient while 
obscuring the danger of others (the low-fat, high-salt product) and of 
standardizing wording so that manufacturers educate rather than promote. They 
have even suggested a new "interagency" agency just to handle the new load. 
</P>
<P>
It almost seems better to let consumers get their diet and health advice -- 
including recommendations for calorie and sodium consumption -- from the 
scientific community and to restrict the front of food labels to words like 
"soup," modified by "vegetable, "yummy," and "good." On the back, there would 
be required disclosure of all ingredients and their nutritional components, so 
consumers could themselves pick out foods that give them the kind and amount of 
nutrition they want. 
</P>
<P>
And every time we fret that we may have deprived the world of a potent and 
objective educational force by not permitting food companies to teach health 
and disease-prevention, we can just consider what many of them did with 
"natural."

CHILEAN FRUIT BACK ON PRODUCE STANDS; BIG CHAINS WAITING FOR NEW SHIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chilean grapes and berries began reappearing in some produce departments 
Thursday as inspectors cleared the first batches of fresh fruit held in cold 
storage since the Food and Drug Administration found two cyanide-tainted grapes 
March 12. 
</P>
<P>
But the Southland's three largest supermarket chains -- Vons, Ralphs and Lucky 
-- said they will pass up the older fruit in favor of fresh supplies aboard the 
freighter America Rex, as will Stater Bros. The freighter is expected to reach 
the Port of Los Angeles today or Saturday, having left Valparaiso, Chile, March 
14. 
</P>
<P>
The America Rex's 195,000 cases of grapes, apples, pears and plums will have to 
go through the same scrutiny as the fruit already ashore, with inspectors 
checking a 5% sample, or a minimum of 15,000 cases. Nonetheless, most stores 
expect to be restocked within a week. But as a result, fruit was conspicuous by 
its absence from most of Thursday's newspaper grocery ads. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first retailers to restock the once forbidden fruit was Irvine Ranch 
Farmers Market in Irvine. Produce manager Jose Galvan said customers are buying 
the grapes, which are labeled by variety -- white or black seedless -- rather 
than by place of origin. 
</P>
<P>
"They taste very good, very sweet," Galvan said. "I had to try them before I 
put them out. There is nothing to be scared of." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, shoppers were split on the subject: Some told reporters that the 
cyanide scare spooked them, while others said it would not stop them from 
buying grapes in the future. While an elderly shopper shunned grapes, saying, 
"I'm not a gambler," Joyce A. Jones of Irvine reasoned that "when they find 
something in just two grapes, that's not too much to be concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
"I would buy them and wash them," added Katy S. Robbins from Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the FDA has only approved inspection procedures for grapes, berries, 
pears and nectarines. Importers are anxious that inspection procedures be 
approved for the Granny Smith apples now arriving -- apples that they also say 
are free of the controversial chemical daminozide, marketed in this country as 
Alar. 
</P>
<P>
The stepped-up inspection procedure is expected to continue through April or 
until the end of Chile's fruit exportations, said Tom Boschee, a produce 
inspector for a major Chilean shipper, David del Curto. 
</P>
<P>
At Christian Salveson Cold Storage in La Habra, one group of newly hired 
inspectors told a reporter that a colleague had found one nectarine that 
appeared to have a needle puncture, which prompted an FDA inspector to 
confiscate the entire crate for lab testing. 
</P>
<P>
So far, importers have been paying the cost of the stepped-up inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Chilean winter fruit industry said that with the 
financial backing of Chile's government, it is ready to resume exportation 
under the "unprecedented inspection procedures now operational at all U.S. 
ports." Ronald Bown, executive director of the Chilean Exporters' Assn. in 
Washington, said Chile will finance the withdrawal of the country's fruit 
already in U.S. distribution channels at the time the FDA found the two 
contaminated grapes in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Eastes, general manager of David Oppenheimer -- California, which 
imports about a third of the Chilean fruit passing through the ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach, said he welcomes financial help for disposing of 
recalled or spoiled fruit in storage. But he noted that none of the other 
importation costs will be covered at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"My crop was shortened," he said, "but, hey! That's better than a lot of other 
scenarios I can think of." 
</P>

contributed to this report.

CHILE, WORLD BANK TO COMPENSATE FOR FRUIT BAN LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government of Chile and the World Bank have pledged financial backing to 
compensate for losses that resulted from the Bush Administration's five-day ban 
on Chilean fruit, officials representing Chilean exporters and U.S. importers 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While details of the plan have not yet been worked out, the promise of 
financial incentives will enable retailers and others in this country to 
destroy fruit that accumulated during the embargo and clear the system for 
incoming shipments from the South American nation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for removing the fruit from the system is the spoilage caused by 
delays, not because the fruit is adulterated," Ronald Bown, executive director 
of the Chilean Exporters' Assn., said at a press conference. "It would take too 
much time, too much money and too much manpower to inspect and clear the fruit 
for return to market. When Chilean fruit returns to the U.S. market, we intend 
to provide only the premium quality the U.S. consumer has always demanded." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Empties Pipeline' 
</P>
<P>
Bown estimated that economic losses for exporters and importers from the ban 
last week would total about $240 million, and officials representing U.S. 
importers said about 3 million cases of fruit worth as much as $75 million will 
have to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
They said prices for consumers may be "slightly higher for the first few days" 
after Chilean fruit returns to grocery store shelves but predicted that "the 
market will return to normal" once the supply reaches its usual volume. 
</P>
<P>
"When you remove this amount of fruit, it totally empties the pipeline, so that 
when you return fruit, the initial demand will be very, very strong," said 
George F. Carstens, president of the American Produce Assn. "We are a supply 
and demand economy, so the initial impact of the first few days may be slightly 
higher in terms of prices to retailers -- which may or may not be reflected in 
prices to consumers." 
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed by the Food and Drug Administration March 13 after two red 
seedless grapes containing puncture marks and minute traces of cyanide were 
discovered in a shipment that arrived in the port of Philadelphia, which 
receives more than half of all Chilean fruit exports. The inspections that 
found the tainted grapes were conducted after an unidentified caller telephoned 
the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, threatening to poison fruit headed for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The ban emptied store shelves across the nation of all fruit of Chilean origin 
and threatened critical damage to the Chilean economy. The United States 
purchases more than half of Chilean fruit exports. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the FDA announced that it would return Chilean grapes and other 
berries to the market under a new, enhanced inspection system here, coupled 
with increased security measures in Chile. However, the FDA said fruit that 
already had left U.S. ports for distribution to markets before the embargo 
would have to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agency's new procedures, inspections have increased to 5% of fruit, 
or a minimum of 15,000 cases from each vessel, whichever is larger. Earlier 
this week, the FDA announced that it also would begin to permit the return of 
Chilean pears and nectarines after inspection. Since the discovery of the two 
cyanide-tainted grapes, no further contaminated fruit has been detected. 
</P>
<P>
Bown said that, despite "losses in the hundreds of millions," the American 
consumer "is ready to buy fresh fruit from Chile." He said importers are now 
reporting back orders of between 500,000 and 1 million cases and "the orders 
continue to arrive." 
</P>
<P>
Fruit exports are the second largest source of foreign exchange for Chile. At 
wholesale, Chilean fruit sold in the United States amounts to nearly $1 billion 
annually, of which $500 million is returned eventually to the Chilean economy. 
More than 10,000 fruit orchard owners in Chile have been affected by the FDA 
ban, along with Chilean packing and shipping facilities, all employing an 
estimated 250,000 workers, for at least a part of the year.

'OSCAR' NIGHT FOR STATE'S AD FIRMS; 
</P>
<P>
IT TAKES STEALTH TO WIN THE TOP PRIZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
An ad for Honda that poked fun at the super-secret stealth bomber flew off 
Thursday night with the West Coast's most prestigious advertising award. 
</P>
<P>
American Honda Motor Co.'s print ad, which compared the design of a Honda 
subcompact to that of the highly sophisticated stealth bomber, won the top 
prize at the 23rd annual Belding Awards at the Century Plaza Hotel. The 
competition -- which received 1,750 entries -- is regarded as the West Coast 
equivalent of New York's top ad awards, the Clios. It is limited to agencies 
with offices in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The agency that created the Honda ads, Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates, won six 
major awards in the competition. Meanwhile, the Venice ad firm Chiat/Day won 
four major awards. Three ad agencies -- and one free-lance duo -- won three 
awards each. In Los Angeles, the Shalek Agency and BBDO/Los Angeles won three 
awards, as did Franklin &amp; Associates of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a Los Angeles-area free-lance team of a copywriter and art director 
walked off with more awards than most of the region's biggest ad firms. The 
team includes copywriter Marc Deschenes and art director Preuit Holland. The 
company Deschenes owns goes by the same name as its phone number, 213-827-9695 
Associates. "I created that name," explained Deschenes, "to get attention at ad 
award shows." 
</P>
<P>
But the big winner was the ad firm Rubin Postaer. The agency's Honda ad -- the 
first print ad to win the top prize in eight years -- shows a Honda CRX Si 
alongside a full-sized stealth model that the agency says it designed from 
available Northrop sketches. The copy in the Honda ad says: "Shrouded in 
secrecy for years, the stealth bomber will soon be introduced to the public. 
For the record, we introduced ours first. The CRX Si." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like the guy who threw his own surprise party," said Larry Postaer, in 
an interview several days before the ceremony. Postaer, executive vice 
president and creative director of Rubin Postaer, was chairman of the judging 
committee of this year's Belding Awards. Judges, however, cannot vote for their 
own agencies in any categories. 
</P>
<P>
"We sometimes wonder if the introduction of the stealth was influenced by our 
commercial," Postaer said. The campaign, which also included television ads, 
began to appear weeks before Northrop officially unveiled the stealth to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Night for Agency 
</P>
<P>
A Northrop spokesman said the Honda campaign did not affect the timing of the 
stealth introduction. "But we did get a good chuckle out of it," said Tony 
Cantafio, vice president of public relations at Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
For Rubin Postear -- which has since donated its giant, $200,000 stealth model 
to the Strategic Air Command Museum in Rapid City, S.D. -- it was one of the 
biggest nights in the 2-year-old agency's short existence. "The Belding awards 
have made and broken several agencies in this town," Postaer said. "Only time 
will tell what it will do to us." 
</P>
<P>
One agency that has built its reputation on winning Beldings is Chiat/Day. This 
year, Chiat/Day entered 186 advertisements in the competition -- nearly three 
times that of any other agency. 
</P>
<P>
While Chiat/Day did collect a respectable four prizes this year, for the second 
year in a row it did not pull in the competition's top prize. Until last year, 
when the ad firm Della Femina, McNamee WCRS won for a "Joe Isuzu" spot, 
Chiat/Day had won the grand prize four years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"Chiat/Day used to stand head and tail above everyone else," said Sandra 
Inbody-Brick, who is president of the ad firm Inbody-Brick &amp; Co. and who 
organized this year's Belding Awards ceremony. "We have more people doing 
better advertising in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy G. Shalek, president of the Shalek Agency, said the results could signal 
an end to the creative dominance of Chiat/Day in the Los Angeles market. "Jay 
Chiat drove the entire Los Angeles ad market to do better," Shalek said. "But 
right now, I perceive that Jay Chiat's priorities are other than running the 
most creative ad agency in town. He wants to have a major, international ad 
agency. And that is entirely different." 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Wolf, president of Chiat/Day's Los Angeles office, sees it a little 
differently. "We don't want to be the most creative ad agency in town. We want 
to be the most creative agency in the world," said Wolf, who was highly 
complimentary of the prize-winning Honda spot. "It's not winning the grand 
prize that matters, but doing terrific work day in and day out for all of our 
clients." 
</P>
<P>
Shalek's agency won several awards for its offbeat print ads for surf wear 
manufacturer Gotcha Sportswear. The ads, which feature photos of people who are 
clearly not surfers, jokingly warn: "If you don't surf, don't start." 
</P>
<P>
Shalek also won an award for a TV commercial for the popular game show 
"Jeopardy." In the ad, a scientist holds up two sealed jars -- one with what 
looks like a large brain and one with a small brain. The scientist explains 
that the brains belong to identical twin brothers -- but that only one of the 
brothers regularly watched "Jeopardy." He holds up the jar with the larger 
brain. "Coincidence?" he asks. "We don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Los Angeles area's largest ad firms were entirely shut out in the 
competition. "When you don't win any, it spurs you on to do better work," said 
J. Craig Mathiesen, chairman of this year's Beldings and president of the Los 
Angeles office of Ketchum Advertising, which won one award in the competition 
for a billboard ad it created for Bear Mountain. "If you don't take risks," 
said Mathiesen, "you don't win Beldings."

GRAND JURY STUDYING HUGHES OPTICS IN ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft is the target of a federal grand jury investigation into the 
quality and delivery of mirrors that it uses in cruise missile guidance systems 
and in a weapons sight for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the company said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the grand jury investigation, which is being conducted in 
Boston, was disclosed in the firm's annual 10K report to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Hughes said it "has been advised that it is a target of 
the investigation" and is cooperating with the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based aerospace firm said the grand jury recently subpoenaed 
records involving Hughes' relationship with the supplier of the mirrors, 
Borjohn Optical Group in Burlington, Mass. The mirrors are made of highly 
polished metal and are supplied to Hughes' Electro-Optical Data Systems Group 
in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, Hughes said the investigation is still in its 
early stages and that the company is conducting its own review. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on that review, we will vigorously defend against any criminal charges 
relating to the circumstances behind the delivery and quality of the two 
missile guidance systems," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said Donald J. Atwood Jr, formerly president of GM Hughes 
Electronics, the GM subsidiary that includes Hughes, had no involvement in 
program. Atwood has been nominated for deputy secretary of defense and is 
awaiting confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
A different federal grand jury investigation that surfaced last year into 
possible mischarging by Hughes for TOW missiles has completed its 
investigation.

America's big chocolate makers are trying to sweeten their Easter profits, and 
analysts say the expansion of special holiday products will increase sales for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when many of the major companies were not involved in 
seasonal-type packaging," said Jan Kitt, associate publisher of The Confection 
magazine, based in Orlando, Fla. Small producers of chocolate bunnies and candy 
eggs provided most of the specialty Easter products. 
</P>
<P>
While industry watchers don't have statistics on who controls what part of the 
Easter market, they agree that times have changed. Chocolate giants such as 
Hershey Foods Corp. and M&amp;M-Mars have entered the fray with seasonal 
versions of their regular products, and manufacturers are giving more attention 
to special holiday displays, Kitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more packages are geared to the holiday season," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easter Variations 
</P>
<P>
The National Confectioners Assn. is projecting sales of $815 million of Easter 
chocolate and candy sales this year, a 2% increase from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Easter's been doing very well," said Dick O'Connell, president of the McLean, 
Va.-based Chocolate Manufacturers Assn. "Part of it is we're going back to more 
traditional thinking in terms of holidays. More attention is being paid to 
chocolate bunnies and fancy Easter eggs and jelly beans -- all the things that 
go with Easter." 
</P>
<P>
Hershey and Mars, which together control most of the domestic chocolate market, 
offer Easter variations of their popular year-round products. Hershey has been 
marketing Kisses wrapped in Christmas and Easter colors for years, but its 
recent acquisition of Cadbury's, which makes several chocolate Easter egg 
products, should boost holiday sales, said spokesman Carl Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
"The company found that there's quite a market for special packaging for 
existing products," said analyst R. Bentley Offutt of Offutt Securities Inc.

SDN Bancorp, parent of San Dieguito National Bank, will allow an agreement to 
sell controlling interest in the bank to Wall Street Financial Corp. of 
Honolulu to terminate March 31, the deal's expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
SDN Bancorp, which will also terminate a franchise agreement with Wall Street 
Financial that would have made it a "Wall Street Financial Center," said the 
acquisition encountered unspecified regulatory delays. 
</P>
<P>
The bank has offices in Encinitas and La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the deal last May, SDN Bancorp said Wall Street had acquired a 
4.9% interest in the bank for $92,000 and lent it $408,000. On Thursday, SDN 
Bancorp said the Honolulu investor will remain a shareholder and that SDN 
Bancorp will pay back the loan in September, 1990. The loan would have been 
converted to equity had the acquisition gone through. 
</P>
<P>
With assets of $60 million as of Dec. 31, the bank reported net income of 
$341,000, or $.62 a share for 1988. Despite the termination of the WSF deal, 
SDN Bancorp said its capital position was a "strong" 7.5% of average assets as 
of Dec. 31.

ECONOMIC EXPANSION HELD BACK BY DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economy expanded at a moderate 2.4% annual rate in the last three months of 
1988, the government reported Thursday, but analysts said the figure was held 
down by last summer's drought and masked strong underlying growth at year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic 
health, would have been closer to 3.5% last quarter were it not for the 
drought, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are divided over how much of that momentum extended into 1989, but 
most expect a slowdown as the aging economic expansion stretches through its 
seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter GNP figure was revised upward from an initial government 
estimate of 2% and contributed to growth of 3.9% for all of 1988, the best 
showing since a 6.8% increase in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed Wants to Slow Growth 
</P>
<P>
"The upward revision underscores a banner year for the economy growth-wise in 
1988 and indicates the strong momentum that the economy carried over into 
1989," said economist Allen Sinai of Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Several recent government reports, however, have offered signs the economy 
already may be cooling off in response to efforts by the Federal Reserve Board 
to raise interest rates to dampen inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales, housing construction, orders for durable goods and factory 
operating rates all were down last month, while inflation remained above last 
year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve wants to slow growth to a more sustainable pace to reverse 
what Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has called "disturbing" price increases, 
although some critics are afraid the central bank could go too far and push the 
country into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Lawrence Chimerine of the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the 
critical question is how significantly the economy is cooling, although it 
appears the nation is moving toward slower growth rather than an outright 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much too premature to conclude we're heading into a recession," Chimerine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's anti-inflation efforts and a trade deficit that is worsening as the 
export boom stalls both are expected to contribute to slower growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
GNP growth is likely to decline by more than a percentage point in 1989 to 
around 2.7%, analysts believe, despite an anticipated sharp upswing in the 
first quarter due to a rebound from the drought. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is counting on growth of 3.2% to help it reduce the 
federal budget deficit while adhering to the President's "no new taxes" 
campaign pledge. 
</P>
<P>
The government next month will release its initial estimate for GNP growth in 
the first quarter. Forecasters are pegging the figure at around 4.7%, with a 
2.5 percentage-point boost from the farm rebound masking a broader economic 
slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, said the economy could be 
particularly sluggish in the second half of this year, with the risk of 
recession running at about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Fed had "no choice but to tighten" its grip on the money 
supply, given the troubling inflation numbers, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts warn that the nation could experience a double negative this year 
if the economy cools but inflation fails to respond quickly to that slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be the year in which real growth may be slowing while inflation is 
accelerating," said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
An inflation index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5.3% in the 
October-December quarter, up from 4.7% in the third quarter. Those figures 
represent high levels for the GNP deflator, which had risen at an annual rate 
of 3.8% or less for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate profits, meanwhile, were up 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 14.6% for 
all of 1988, the government reported. Last year's increase was the biggest 
since a 22.4% post-recession jump in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The upward revision in last quarter's GNP figure reflected higher government 
spending than earlier estimated and a smaller drop in business investment.

INFLATION APPEARS TO BE COOLING OFF, BRADY SAYS

<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Thursday that inflation seems to be 
cooling off and suggested that there may be no reason to raise interest rates 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Although the White House and the Federal Reserve have sometimes squabbled in 
recent months over the inflation threat, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated 
Wednesday that he, too, wanted to wait and see what impact the central bank's 
recent credit tightening would have on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the National Assn. of Manufacturers, Brady acknowledged 
differences of opinion but said the Administration was as determined as the 
Federal Reserve to curb inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to have different interpretations of the same economic 
statistics and still share the same goal of fighting inflation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While some economic indicators were of concern, such as the large 1% increase 
in producer prices in both January and February, others were reassuring, Brady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited recent declines in durable goods orders and retail sales as well as 
Tuesday's moderate 0.4% increase in the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Rates Higher 
</P>
<P>
An executive in the audience took issue with Brady's optimism that inflation is 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Nord, president of Schauer Manufacturing Corp., a small Cincinnati firm 
that makes battery chargers, said he was ordering a 6% price increase as of 
today because the cost of his raw materials, including steel, copper and 
cardboard, had doubled in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just begining to pass along to our customers the cost increases we've 
had over the past year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady responded that for competitive reasons not all industries were in a 
position to pass along higher costs to consumers. "The CPI seems to be leveling 
off at a 4% increase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told a House banking subcommittee that the full effects of the Fed's 
tighter policy over the past year have yet to be felt by the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed has gradually pushed up short-term interest rates from about about 6.5% 
last March to nearly 10% today in an attempt to prevent inflationary pressures 
from destabilizing the economy and thereby killing the current expansion, now 
in its seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said there are "significant lags" between the time the Fed pushes up 
interest rates and when economic activity begins to slow in response. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson's observation Wednesday 
that the economy is showing signs of moderating, economists took Greenspan's 
remarks to mean that the Fed would not tighten credit further for now. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said Tuesday that he would be unhappy if interest rate increases 
dampened economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Although he denied any policy differences with the Fed he seemed to be 
signaling Greenspan not to press too hard on the monetary brakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see any actions taken that are going to kill off the growth in 
our economy," Bush told reporters.

LONG-DISTANCE PHONE RATES TO DIP AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
BUT CONSUMERS WILL PAY 30 CENTS MORE PER MONTH ON LOCAL BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long-distance rates for calls between states will drop again April 1, but 
telephone customers will pay correspondingly more -- 30 cents a month -- on 
their local phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
The lower interstate tolls and offsetting increase in local bills stem from a 
Federal Communications Commission program that, over several years now, has 
been shifting to customers a large part of the costs that long-distance 
carriers pay local phone companies for completing calls. 
</P>
<P>
According to an FCC finding released in Washington, American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph will save even more than the company had estimated -- $705 million, 
compared to $533 million. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC study also found that the local phone companies underestimated by even 
more last December when they proposed reducing their long-distance connection 
charges by $489 million to offset the 30 cents they will gain from local 
customers in the form of an increase to the "subscriber line charge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Pass Along Savings 
</P>
<P>
The subscriber line charge has been rising periodically in increments until, on 
April 1, it will peak at $3.50 month. Theoretically, that sum represents each 
phone user's contribution to the fixed costs of maintaining a nationwide 
telephone network, regardless of how much a customer may call long distance. 
</P>
<P>
With residential and business users paying more, AT&amp;T has to pay less under 
the FCC's shared-cost system. And AT&amp;T also must pass along its savings in 
connection charges to its customers in lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T will have to recalculate its interstate tolls now in light of the FCC 
finding, Los Angeles spokeswoman Daylanne Johnson said, but added: "This is 
more good news for our customers, since their rates will be even lower than we 
had anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, the new reduction will follow the pattern that AT&amp;T proposed 
on Feb. 15, based on a $533-million reduction. That called for a rate cut 
averaging 1.6% overall. The April 1 reduction will drop prices nearly 40% lower 
than before the Bell breakup five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the price changes -- under the February proposal, at least -- would vary 
according to a customer's calling habits. For example, rates on about a third 
of AT&amp;T's interstate traffic -- those calls running less than 292 miles -- 
would have increased 4.7%, which AT&amp;T described as "less than a penny a 
minute." On the other hand, rates during normal business hours (8 a.m. to 5 
p.m., Monday through Friday) would have dropped 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The business-day reduction normally benefits commercial accounts more than 
residential customers, who do most of their long-distance calling late at night 
and on weekends, when rates are discounted 35%. The proposal would have trimmed 
that discount to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
A $705-million rate cut would likely exaggerate each of those changes.

Rivals Usually Follow Suit 
</P>
<P>
While AT&amp;T's competitors, principally MCI and US Sprint, are not regulated 
by the FCC -- and thus are not obligated to reduce their rates to reflect their 
lower costs -- in the past they have mimicked AT&amp;T's reductions to maintain 
a pricing advantage in the nation's $50-billion long-distance 
telecommunications market. 
</P>
<P>
The shared cost of the interlocking local and long-distance networks became 
necessary after the breakup of the Bell System owned by AT&amp;T, which 
operated a seamless network through its 22 subsidiary companies. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1984, when AT&amp;T was divested of all local operations to settle 
a longstanding government antitrust lawsuit, those local subsidiaries were 
regrouped under seven regional holding companies, including San Francisco-based 
Pacific Telesis, parent of Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Lubamersky, Pacific Bell's director of access services, said the company 
is "very happy with the (FCC) order" because the reduced connection costs will 
make its services more attractive.

U.S. AUTO SALES RISE 2.8% IN A SLUGGISH MID-MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
New domestic car sales rose 2.8% in mid-March, the auto companies reported 
Thursday. The overall sales total was disappointing, auto industry analysts 
said, and only confirmed a pattern of weakening sales throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
The sales slump is due, they said, to consumer worries about the economy -- 
caused by reports of rising interest rates -- and a lessening of consumer 
demand for autos. 
</P>
<P>
The eight domestic auto manufacturers -- including foreign manufacturers that 
produce cars on U.S. soil -- reported that they sold 194,597 units in the 
10-day period, against 189,245 units in the period last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales were slightly weaker than I expected," said David Healy, an automotive 
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. "They were up a bit from last 
year, but last year's period was very weak. I think you'll see (the sales) go 
down sharply next period. . . . There is a continuing pattern of slowly 
weakening sales that's been going on for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst with J. D. Power &amp; Associates, 
agreed that sales were weak, especially given the fact that auto manufacturers 
launched a new round of incentives just before the beginning of the mid-month 
sales period. He said auto manufacturers are being affected by consumer worries 
about the economy, a lack of demand and overcapacity in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns About Economy 
</P>
<P>
"I think what is causing the slowdown . . . is partially due to growing 
concerns about the economy," Cedergren said. "The other part is the fact that 
demand for new cars is off. We've had four to five years of strong car sales 
that satisfied all of the pent-up demand for new cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that 1989 is going to be the year of reckoning," Cedergren 
added. "If sales continue at this level . . . sales are going to be tough for 
all the manufacturers, because there is so much more availability of new car 
models. Even a slight downturn will cause severe pressure on the 
manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's sales were up 6.1% for the period, while GM's sales rose 2.1% and 
Chrysler's sales dropped 16.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the transplanted auto manufacturers reported dramatic gains, due 
largely to increased production capacity at their U.S. assembly plants. Honda's 
sales of U.S.-built cars rose 24.5%, while Nissan's sales jumped 55.8% and 
Mazda's sales rose 86.3%. Toyota's sales rose a softer 3.3%, and fledgling 
transplant Mitsubishi reported sales of 557 units in the 10-day period.

GROUP OF BLACK WORKERS AT GM BALKS AT SETTLEMENT

A group representing several hundred salaried black employees at General Motors 
Corp. said Thursday that it will file a petition opposing a proposed $3-million 
settlement of an affirmative action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Concerned Black Salaried Employees, feels the terms of the 
settlement are "vague and evasive" and do not address their concerns, the 
group's spokesman, Napoleon Quick, said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement of a class-action suit was reached Jan 13. It covers 
10,000 current and former GM employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana between 
1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman said the auto maker continues to believe that the 
settlement "provides the opportunity to redress some perceived inequities and 
at the same time strengthens GM's existing systems to ensure all receive 
equitable treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Patricia Molloy added that GM believes that the settlement is a 
"win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
Quick said the employee group plans to meet Monday and will present federal 
Judge John Feikens with petitions and a pleading asking for a redrafting of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Feikens has yet to set a hearing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, who is on leave from his personnel job at GM's Saginaw Steering plant in 
Detroit, said the group has 48 specific objections to the settlement, involving 
areas such as promotions, pay raises and benefits as well as performance 
appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said some group members are fearful that GM may retaliate against 
workers who do not go along with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, people are telling me to watch out," Quick said. "We're 
not doing this because we're mad. We're in a predicament we are trying to get 
resolved."

MAGAZINES: HARPER'S OFFERS UP A RISKY SPOOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what may prove to be a much-publicized and controversial package, the April 
issue of Harper's magazine asserts that Jesus would need a comprehensive, 
well-coordinated publicity campaign to make the Second Coming a success in the 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of cover stories meant to parody today's obsession with the media 
blitz, the magazine asked a variety of experts to "offer Jesus frank advice on 
six tasks critical to winning over American public opinion: developing a media 
strategy, writing a monologue for a guest-host appearance on 'Saturday Night 
Live,' redesigning the cover of the New Testament and writing the jacket-flap 
copy, designing a contemporary wardrobe, and developing a storyboard for a 
one-minute television commercial." 
</P>
<P>
Senior editor Jack Hitt, who came up with the idea, said the articles try to 
answer the question "How would Christ get sold?" if he were to reappear on 
Earth as predicted in the Book of Revelation. The point, Hitt said, is to 
satirize the widely accepted notion that politicians, rock stars, denture 
creams and, yes, messiahs, all must employ "the same basic tools" to get their 
message, song or product across in today's interlocking, interdependent system 
of print and broadcast media. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ron Suskind, a former political campaign aide in state and national 
races who wrote the main story for the package, acknowledged that the point of 
the exercise may be missed by those who fail to see any humor in a satire that 
uses religion as a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Braced for the Backlash 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting with bated breath to see what kind of treatment puritanical Boston 
gives it," said Suskind, now editor of Boston Business magazine. ". . . I guess 
we're all waiting to see what the reaction's going to be because it could be 
very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We are not poking fun at Jesus but rather at ourselves. We are doing 
a parody of this huge packaging machine in this country. . . . We are trying 
not to underrate our fellow man and if he doesn't get it, it probably means we 
have overrated him." He conceded that some will see the issue as "probably 
sacrilegious and mean-spirited." 
</P>
<P>
In his memo outlining strategy for Jesus' tour of the United States, Suskind 
advised: "For the first three days, we've planned several miracles of the 
modest water-to-wine variety that should verify Your authenticity but stop 
short of conjuring up the divisive flood-and-fire imagery of Armageddon. We 
want to show a willingness to perform miracles while, at least in the 
beginning, respecting the existing laws of physics. To encourage spontaneity, 
Your itinerary will note various 'miracle opportunities' -- miracle ops." 
</P>
<P>
Suskind also warns that Jesus should beware of the Washington press corps. 
"Leader of the corps is a man named Sam Donaldson, sardonic and versed in human 
sacrifices," he writes, referring to the ABC television newsman. "He is trained 
to ask the question You most wish to avoid. He will try to test and embarrass 
You, probably with one of those theological chestnuts. Our sources indicate he 
will ask: 'If you are omnipotent, can You create a rock You cannot lift?' Think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rags to Heavenly Riches' 
</P>
<P>
The new jacket-flap copy for the New Testament, written by Norton book 
publishing's Gerry Howard, reports that "At the age of 30 Jesus was an obscure 
Jewish carpenter in a backwater province of the Roman Empire . . . today, 
countless millions in every corner of the world call Him Savior. In an age 
devoted to the creation and near-worship of celebrity, His name recognition 
worldwide is uncontested." Describing the work of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John 
as "four novellas," the jacket copy says that each book retells "the compelling 
personal saga of Jesus, a breathtaking rags-to-heavenly riches story of 
struggles and triumphs, of faith and betrayal, of suffering and death -- and 
Eternal Life." 
</P>
<P>
Editor Hitt said he had a tough time obtaining articles suitable for the point 
he was trying to make. "I 
</P>
<P>
had to kill a lot of pieces because a lot of people assumed it was a lampoon on 
Christ," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Hitt and Suskind said they've had little reaction and most of that has 
been favorable. But both expect response -- possibly even fulminations -- from 
unappreciative quarters starting this week. Subscribers began receiving their 
copies of Harper's last week, but the issue is only now showing up on 
newsstands, according to Hitt. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother likes it but he said he wouldn't recommend anybody reprint it in 
the South," said Hitt, a native of South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two, Suskind seems to expect the more dire reactions, both short term 
and long term. For one thing, when he asked eight major political media 
consultants to help with the project, all declined, even though they expressed 
initial delight with the concept. In general, the consultants told him they 
were worried that their participation would "fall into the hands of my 
opponents in the next race and it would be used against my candidate," Suskind 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, Suskind figures he isn't going to be able to work in politics 
again for a long time, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any realm where there are more peculiar resurrections 
than politics," he said. "I will never say never. But I have no plans to return 
to politics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Travelers' Checks 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was voted one winner and one loser in Entree's second annual 
Excellence Awards based on the votes of more than 4,000 readers of the Santa 
Barbara-based newsletter for upscale travelers. The Hotel Bel-Air was selected 
as the best hotel in the United States while another local institution, Spago, 
was voted the "most overrated restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Billionaire Donald Trump's Plaza Hotel in New York was voted -- for the second 
year -- the "most overrated hotel anywhere" as Entree readers overcame "a 
brainwashing plethora of publicity and advertising from the glitzmeister Donald 
Trump." 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter's readers also zinged the Beverly Hills Hotel, "proving that 
even if you are the Sultan of Brunei with a zillion dollars it doesn't mean you 
can have a top hotel." The sultan purchased the landmark hotel in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A San Francisco restaurant, Masa's, was voted the best restaurant in the United 
States, while Taillevent in Paris was voted the best foreign restaurant. London 
got the nod for the best foreign hotel, the Connaught, while the Mauna Kea 
resort on Hawaii's Big Island was voted the "best resort anywhere." Singapore 
Airlines was voted the world's best airline. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also reported other dislikes with airlines, particularly American 
carriers, getting the "most thrashing." Entree's readers disliked airline food, 
shrinking seat space, "babies and parents being bumped into first-class, excess 
hand luggage, lack of safety, chatty captains" and "lack of service." On the 
ground they hated "over-friendly waiters, hotel phone systems, customs, 
mini-bar checks, pretentiousness, smoking, and sloppy, informal service."

LOGAN HAS DESIGNS ON HAVING IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI BERGER, Berger is West Coast editor of In Fashion magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karl Logan is sitting in the Center Hall of the airy Santa Monica Mall 
supervising the final construction phase of his first retail store. Sipping 
black coffee and smoking incessantly, he recalls a fateful night about a year 
and a half ago that would impact the course of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sailing the British Caribbean on vacation," he says with an 
irrepressible grin, "and there wasn't a lot to do but drink tequila and think a 
lot. I was lying there one night looking up at the stars and I made a decision 
that I wanted to have it all. And even if I only got 50% of it, it would be 50% 
more than I had before." 
</P>
<P>
Although the youthful, 39-year-old designer might not yet have it all, he's got 
more now than he's had in the last 20 years that he's been piecing, sewing and 
designing his progressive signature-clothing collections. 
</P>
<P>
The company closed out its 1988 fiscal year with a record $3 million in sales; 
in January he won the California Mart's coveted Designer of the Year Award; for 
spring he introduced a long-awaited menswear collection, and this week he will 
unveil the store he hopes will serve as a showcase for his complete men's and 
women's collections. Not bad for a middle-class kid from Bakersfield, who still 
jokes he "has straw behind the ears." 
</P>
<P>
Just recently, even his personal style has changed. Gone are the trademark 
black beret and shoulder-length locks. Today he sports a short, spiky do and a 
more refined look that includes his own tasteful black-and-white check, 
double-breasted suit, white T-shirt and cutout, peek-a-boo black leather shoes. 
The look is indeed more in sync with the competitive business world in which 
the still rebellious, yet business-minded Logan has become a part. 
</P>
<P>
"When I tell people that I'm opening up my first store in the Santa Monica 
Mall, you should see the looks on their faces," Logan says, and laughs his 
infectious laugh. "But you know what I say to them, 'They spend money in malls; 
they window shop on Melrose.' " 
</P>
<P>
Since joining forces with partner Joseph Morales three years ago, the intrepid 
duo has carefully nurtured the Karl Logan name into a label that commands 
recognition and respect -- even from hard-to-please New York retailers. 
Barneys, Charivari and Saks Fifth Avenue head the list of impressive East Coast 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on, we tried to address the attitude and taste levels of Easterners," 
explains Morales, a former chief operating officer of NutraSweet. 
</P>

"Easterners prefer suitings; Westerners are more casual in their dress. So we 
incorporated both concepts." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, his path has taken him into menswear, where he hopes to loosen 
up the corporate look. Or, as he puts it, "take the gray flannel suit out of 
Wall Street and into Soho. I'm designing for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I make everything I want to wear, but can never find. I want the customer who 
looks aggressive and is progressive, not the corporate guy who lives and 
dresses by rules and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he says: "I would never buy anything that costs more than my 
rent," which is $1,000 for his West Hollywood apartment. 
</P>
<P>
He also believes in putting personal style ahead of fashion: "Fashion is 
something you put on, style is something that you have, it's your sense of wit, 
practicality and what's involved in your life. It's what makes you, you."

2 PHOTO EXHIBITS PROBE THE HIDDEN DEPTHS OF SOUTH

<P>
Two exhibits that opened this month at the San Diego Museum of Photographic 
Arts are tailor-made for the curious, the inquisitive and anyone willing to 
confront the darker recesses in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The photographers are both Southern women of the baby-boom generation, who, 
through their evocative black-and-white images, take viewers on separate but 
challenging journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Fleming Caffery's exhibit, "Bayou Memoirs," is a shadowy excursion into 
the rural South, where she specializes in capturing the raw, unvarnished way of 
life still lived by today's Louisiana sugar cane workers. 
</P>
<P>
In "Family Pictures: A work in Progress," Sally Mann cruises the psyches of 
parents and children, probing the tears, fears, tribulations and joys of 
growing up and rearing children. 
</P>
<P>
Both artists seem to enjoy using light and shadow as compositional elements to 
focus attention on their subjects. Caffery makes maximum use of darkness the 
same way Clint Eastwood used night and shadow to set a mood for "Bird," last 
year's film about jazzman Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Caffery captures the cutting pre-dawn December chill of the sugar cane workers, 
who stand huddled around the flames of a burning tire in a cut field. The field 
is dotted with fires after sundown as the waste cane is burned, filling the 
fading, streaky sky with smoke. 
</P>
<P>
In "Bayou Memoirs," Caffery's technique is not the straightforward 
documentation of a Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans. Nor is it the sugarcoated 
Southern juke joint photography of her contemporary, Bernie Imes. She is more 
of an Expressionist outraged by these conditions, yet in love with her 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
She mirrors the oppressive, unforgiving existence of these workers -- both 
black and white -- with a pervasive gloominess, an encroaching darkness. Her 
full and partial silhouettes -- a face with stubbly chin seen through a window 
screen or a tall, backlighted man with arms raised as if in fond greeting for a 
young child -- tend to distance and even depersonalize her subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Not all is dark. One of Caffery's photographs in the show that was organized by 
museum director Arthur Ollman looks at first like an abstract Jackson Pollock 
painting. But a man's bare arm and the mirror and door handle fittings identify 
the image as that of a pickup truck's door, crosshatched with spattered mud. 
</P>
<P>
Caffery loads another truck photograph with myriad detail. Focusing her lens 
through the windshield, she somehow captures the heat and lassitude of an 
early-August morning as the sun slants through the rear window. The 
bespectacled driver, turning his head, is in shadow. His dog sits hunched 
outside the rear window waiting for work, its silhouette outlined in the 
window's layer of summer dust. 
</P>
<P>
Other shots suggest the poverty of these field hands. Wrinkled and torn 
curtains mute and filter the light that pours into a darkened room. A pair of 
lizards lazily soak up the November sun on a door's torn screen. 
</P>
<P>
A worn-out sock rests on a rough 
</P>
<P>
wooden floor next to a steel washer and a pair of shoes. In the gloom, we can 
barely see the woman's legs that rise out of the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Directly or indirectly, it is the people of Southern Louisiana whom Caffery 
wants us to know. Despite the grind and oppression of their lives, they 
persist. Her picture of a diapered child, laughing with a dim ray of light on 
its soft neck, belies the peasant life that lies in this tyke's future. 
</P>
<P>
Caffery's portraits of these men and women reveal not only weathered and 
chapped hands and faces, but also the spiritual tenacity that transcends their 
lifelong fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Mann's "Family Pictures" exhibit makes up an often surrealistic journey 
through the unconscious. It is filled with photographs that are often 
troubling. The museum has even posted signs advising visitors to use 
discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, who was born and lives today in Virginia, has embarked on a continuing 
project of photographing her three children as they grow up. What distinguishes 
her work from most family albums, aside from the fact that she is a 
professional photographer of rare gifts, is the approach. 
</P>
<P>
Mann is just as willing to shoot her kids at their worst behavior as at their 
best. The contradictory nature of children -- both angel and devil -- is grist 
for her mill. More than that, she chooses to delve into the land of taboos, the 
nightmares parents have for their children: injury, death, physical and sexual 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In "Tobacco Spit," a sweaty chunk of a man in coveralls holds a fragile, blond 
little girl in his strong arms. Mann arranged the picture so that the two are 
in dark shadow, with the midday sun striking only the girl, at once enhancing 
her vulnerability and giving the man a more sinister appearance. The girl's 
intense expression implies that she is more than a bit anxious over the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Mann posed many of these scenes, but caught others as they occurred using a 
large-format 8-by-10-inch camera. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Disputed Banana," a naked, pint-size child clutches a peeled banana in 
her hands and seems to dare Mom to take the forbidden fruit. A spatula on the 
floor hints at events that may have preceded this confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the many arresting images in this exhibit is of Mann's son Emmett 
standing waist-deep in a river. The water is absolutely glassy except for where 
the fingertips of Emmett's hand touch the surface and where the water swirls 
out from his waist. 
</P>
<P>
The patch of water where Emmett stands reflects the light sky. He is framed by 
dark jagged reflections of the woods that seem to be pressing in on him. The 
intensity of his expression mirrors the tension of the moment in the picture, 
title, "Last Time Emmett Modeled Nude." 
</P>
<P>
In "Jessie at Five," Mann captures the essence of precociousness. Although the 
two girls that flank Jessie look like kids, the shirtless Jessie, her blond 
hair in a bob, wearing fake pearl necklace, rhinestone earrings and lipstick, 
looks as sophisticated as any 30-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
The images Mann has made in this exhibit -- from children sitting uncomfortably 
at the hospital bed of their dying grandfather or posing decorously in a tutu 
with a freshly shot deer -- capture the often incongruous process of growing 
up. But, more than that, Mann has accomplished an amazing feat of revealing the 
darker thoughts that parents almost never articulate.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: STAR-GAZING OVER THE TRUE MEANING OF A PLAYER SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Start the parade, toss the confetti. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Sawyer leaves CBS for ABC. Connie Chung leaves NBC for CBS. Mary Alice 
Williams leaves CNN for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Does it matter? Yes . . . no . . . maybe. As TV news anchors like to say, "Stay 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
The new assignments: 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer: Trades prominent role on "60 Minutes" for more money and future as Sam 
Donaldson's co-anchor on ABC prime-time news program. 
</P>
<P>
Chung: No more anchoring Saturday's "NBC Nightly News" and occasional NBC news 
specials. Next stop: anchor role on remodeled "West 57th" and the "CBS Evening 
News" on Sunday, and filling in for Dan Rather. Plus more money. 
</P>
<P>
Williams: Goodby to anchoring CNN's prime-time news from New York with vice 
president's title. Hello to anchoring planned prime-time news series and 
substitute anchoring other news programs on NBC. Plus more money. 
</P>
<P>
What does it mean? 
</P>
<P>
Here is one well-placed CBS News source thinking out loud: 
</P>
<P>
"It's a three-way trade with some women who have proven credentials and a lot 
of box-office personality. It's good business for all of them. Of the three, 
Sawyer has certainly proved herself as a very solid reporter. She's a very 
smart woman. But none of them is an airhead." 
</P>
<P>
The words "box office" stand out. 
</P>
<P>
"Show business is clearly a part of what we do for a living," said Deep Source, 
a serious, seasoned journalist who requested anonymity. "You can argue about 
the box-office draw of each particular woman. What this shows is that there is 
a value placed on not only their ability to report, but also their attributes 
as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Because all of the subjects are female, have the Sawyer, Chung and Williams 
shifts been overcovered? 
</P>
<P>
"They've been doing it with white men for years," Deep Source said about highly 
publicized network talent wars. "The battles over Dan Rather, Ted Koppel, 
Charles Osgood and Charles Kuralt were examples of that. When you get to this 
level of superstardom, it certainly draws your interest. I think it's a measure 
of how much women have advanced in the business." 
</P>
<P>
NBC News has promised to use the reported $900,000 it had been paying Chung to 
hire three more experienced correspondents. Wouldn't CBS News -- which has cut 
back on staff for budgetary reasons -- be better off, too, using the money it 
was paying Sawyer to add reporters instead of the mega-salaried Chung? 
</P>
<P>
"That's naive," Deep Source insisted. "You always will have to have superstars 
to bring people into the tent." 
</P>
<P>
The problems begin when the superstars inevitably obscure the tent. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, this latest episode of musical stars is evidence anew 
of TV's homage to celebrity journalists. Sawyer/Chung/Williams has far less to 
do with the gathering and reporting of news than with super agents and super 
lawyers and with the way news on TV is tailored to and shaped around 
personalities. This is a corporate business exercise played out far above the 
trenches. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that the contracts of Sawyer, Chung and Williams happened to have 
expired in close proximity, and that perhaps gender was not a factor. Yet the 
more compelling scenario finds Chung being hired precisely to replace CBS's 
best-known female, Sawyer, and Williams being hired precisely to replace NBC's 
best-known female, Chung. Networks do business that way. Carrying it further, 
the next move seems to be CNN's, TV's version of the player to be named later. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying all of this is the usual stereotyping -- those reports that 
Barbara Walters was uneasy about Sawyer and that ABC had soothingly assured her 
that she would not be eclipsed by the hiring of Sawyer. As if there were room 
for only one female superstar in each news division. 
</P>
<P>
The Walters story evoked the cliched image of jealous women clawing each other 
like cats. As Chung herself bitterly noted about the story recently: "It's 
always the women who are (seen as) fighting." 
</P>
<P>
As to the "proven credentials" of Sawyer, Chung and Williams, meanwhile, 
opinions surely differ. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some news superstars, Sawyer at CBS was no absentee correspondent who 
let field producers shoulder the entire load. Far from being distinguished, 
however, her work on "60 Minutes" was memorable mostly for her prominence in 
her own stories. 
</P>
<P>
Chung is well liked by colleagues. In reviewing her six years at NBC (after a 
dozen at CBS), however, no highlights come to mind, and a couple of her 
specials were downright embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, in addition to being CNN's strongest anchor -- she especially shone 
during coverage of last summer's political conventions -- oversaw CNN's New 
York bureau. Whether her skills translate to NBC remain to be seen, but of all 
the parties in this "trade," CNN would seem to be the biggest loser. 
</P>
<P>
As with all so-called trades, the outcome may not be known for years. The bet 
here, however, is that the answer is not in the news, but in the stars.

THE BIG MIX;

VIDEO FAST-FORWARDS JAPAN'S TV SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUY AOKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of Los Angeles' Japanese immigrants love TV shows from back home so much 
that they can't wait for them to be aired here on TV or cable. They go instead 
where they can find them faster: at their local gray-market video store. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread practice of renting and selling taped TV shows from Japan is 
accepted by a community hungry for the latest episodes. Older customers and 
middle-aged women head straight for the Japanese soap operas. Middle-aged men 
like drama or ninja-type movies. And the younger crowd goes for suspense, quiz 
and action shows, according to one video store operator. Customers don't seem 
to be bothered by lack of proper licensing -- or even by low-quality 
duplication. 
</P>
<P>
A Little Tokyo video store owner whose shelves were stuffed with Japanese TV 
shows taped off the air -- and who didn't want himself or his shop identified 
-- said his customers include many homesick for their native country, college 
exchange students here for three months and Japanese women married to Caucasian 
men for 15-20 years who still don't understand English well enough to feel 
comfortable here. 
</P>
<P>
The owner has a contact in Japan who tapes TV shows off the air and sends the 
"master" to a tape-duplicating service in Los Angeles. Customers can see the 
programs within two weeks of broadcast in Japan -- a much shorter delay for 
viewers who would otherwise have to wait as long as six months to see those 
same shows here on only a few channels and in limited time periods. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Toyomitsu, manager of the Cinema Club-L.A. video store in Gardena, 
however, refuses to go along with this practice. He claims that his is the only 
store in the mainland United States that doesn't rent taped Japanese TV shows. 
He rents and sells only Japanese and Japanese-subtitled movies -- all authentic 
copies from the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Why not handle TV shows, which would unquestionably boost profits? "For one 
thing," he says with a laugh, "it is illegal. Everybody knows that it is." 
Toyomitsu, 33, who immigrated to the United States when he was 11, opened his 
shop late last year and now carries about 3,000 tapes, including many films 
from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
When he first started his business here, he didn't know what kinds of tapes 
would be popular. "So we took what was popular in Japan and just brought (the 
equivalent of a typical Japanese video) store into the United States." But 
Toyomitsu soon found that tastes here are a little different. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, for instance, he estimates that American movie titles out-rent 
Japanese ones, 8-to-1. Here, it's about 50-50. Gore titles, popular in Japan, 
didn't do well here, and they are now among many of his red-tag specials. He 
researches which titles are popular in Japan and tries to bring them here 
within a month after their release in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his customers keep abreast of new releases through return trips to 
Japan and imported Japanese magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"They're asking for it before I even have it in the store," Toyomitsu said. "By 
word of mouth, they find out what movies are really hot in Japan right now. But 
most of the time, they're asking for the American movies like 'The Last 
Emperor.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cinema Club's 1,200 members (mainly Japanese businessmen and their families who 
have come for a temporary stay of two to three years) pay $4 to rent each title 
for one day. Toyomitsu said he only sells about one or two tapes per month (the 
average cost is about $80). 
</P>
<P>
He also said he copies Japanese movies but doesn't dare rent pirated copies of 
American ones -- his customers know the quality of his tapes won't be as good 
as the originals, but "they don't mind. The customer understands. The customer 
just wants to see the (movie)."

BALLET THEATRE TO RETURN TO MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After eight years of dancing at Shrine Auditorium on its annual West Coast 
visits, American Ballet Theatre will return to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at 
the Music Center for its next Los Angeles engagement in July, 1990, the company 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Dillingham, executive director of ABT, declined to disclose specific 
reasons for the return, but sources close to the company said the move was a 
result of the combination of the public's preference for the Music Center and 
the fact that the dancers feel they look better at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its 50th anniversary season, ABT will perform at the Music Center 
facility for two weeks July 31-Aug. 12. Preceding that engagement, the company 
will dance in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As already announced, ABT will return for a two-week spring season at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center March 6-18, 1990, before making its annual 
visit to the Kennedy Center in Washington in April. 
</P>
<P>
Dillingham said that the ballet troupe is carrying on "further conversations" 
with the L.A. Music Center management regarding future visits to the Pavilion, 
"depending on the schedule there." He said he could not rule out a return to 
Shrine Auditorium, where ABT danced from 1982 until this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Theatre played its first Pavilion engagement in the spring of 1968, 
returning there, after a year's hiatus during which it did not visit Los 
Angeles at all, in 1970. The company then danced at the Music Center every year 
until 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Charles I. Schneider, chairman of the board of Music 
Center Operating Co., said that the Music Center is "delighted to welcome back 
American Ballet Theatre . . . ABT's return is a wonderful addition, indeed, to 
the stellar dance offering by the Joffrey Ballet, the Music Center's resident 
dance company." 
</P>
<P>
Shrine Auditorium officials were not available for comment.

THE PACIFIC CHORALE 'REALIGNS' SCHEDULE WITH NEW CONCERT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to trim expenses, the Pacific Chorale will move one of its 
concerts next season out of the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa for the first time since the group began appearing at the center in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its five-concert 1989-90 season, the chorale will offer a chamber 
concert by the ensemble's 40-member Pacific Singers at Mission San Juan 
Capistrano. The date of the concert will be announced later. 
</P>
<P>
The group also has reduced the number of concerts in its subscription series 
from four this year to three, although the total number of performances will 
remain the same with the addition of a second non-subscription event. 
</P>
<P>
Music director John Alexander refused to describe the move as "a cutback" of 
the chorale's offerings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a realignment of the way we produce," Alexander said. "It will be a 
cutback in expense for us." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said that the program at the mission is "an attempt to see if there 
is an audience for chamber (choral) concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"The center is much better suited for large-scale than for small-scale works. I 
don't think that we can sell chamber works well in the center." 
</P>
<P>
Until last season, the chorale had offered only three subscription concerts at 
the center. Last year, that was expanded to four, but subscriptions fell off. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Alexander said, the Pacific's board was "trying to pull back the 
budget to a realistic figure," but he did not specify any target figure. The 
chorale is operating this year on a budget of about $450,000. Next season's 
budget has not been determined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989-90 season at the center: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oct. 20: Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 2: Works by Praetorius, Respighi and Flor Peeters; plus traditional 
carols. 
</P>
<P>
 -- April 28: Verdi's "Four Sacred Pieces" and choruses from his operas. The 
program will conclude the Chorale's fourth annual Choral Festival, in which 
local high school and college choirs appear in daylong adjudicated performances 
and then join the Pacific in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Non-subscription events: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 18: "Messiah" Sing-Along at the Center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chamber choral concert at Mission San Juan Capistrano: works by Palestrina, 
Debussy, Britten, others. Date to be announced.

Last summer, Charo, the bubbly chanteuse from the Las Vegas Strip, pleaded with 
the dean of the CalArts dance department in an age-old argument that pitted 
commercialism against art. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you know these dancers are stars?" asked Charo, referring to the three 
students she desperately wished to have excused from CalArts for a semester so 
they could continue dancing in her nightclub act. 
</P>
<P>
"They were stars when they got here," replied Cristyne Lawson, the dean. "But 
they'll be artists when they leave. If they want to go with you now, they can." 
</P>
<P>
The students -- Sandra and Linda Cevallos and Herbert Sanchez -- decided 
against putting off their studies. They had performed traditional flamenco 
dance before enrolling in CalArts in 1985, earning about $800 a week with 
Charo. They decided to wait for graduation this spring to rejoin her. 
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, the number of applicants to the CalArts dance 
department has increased by more than one-third. If the Cevallos sisters and 
Sanchez had wanted to leave CalArts, there were plenty of aspiring 
professionals waiting to take their spots. 
</P>
<P>
"More students are applying, and we don't have a program that grows larger," 
said Kenneth Young, director of CalArts admissions. "Dance has become popular 
because television has exposed many people to dance, people who would not 
necessarily go to a live concert." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson agrees that television has had a strong, but not necessarily beneficial, 
influence. "The same kind of people that were students 13 years ago," when 
Lawson came to CalArts as dean, "are the same students now. The difference is 
their perception of dance. They're more familiar with television dancing and 
aerobics, which give people wrong ideas that dancing is only about personality 
and fancy clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson wages her own campaign to strip her students of such notions. Regarding 
Charo, Lawson was not opposed to the commercial aesthetic of the singer's act, 
nor was she against her students earning money. She simply wanted them to 
consider the seductions of being a "star" and to ask themselves why they are 
dancers in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis was easily resolved, said Sandra Cevallos, 24, "because when you're 
on the road performing, you don't have time to take class. And dancers need to 
take class every day. On stage is where you escape from everything. But in 
class is where you learn." 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to CalArts, the sisters were experienced Spanish and flamenco 
performers but neither had taken classes in modern dance or ballet. They had to 
relearn how to move, Cevallos said. The result is greater versatility. 
</P>
<P>
Now when she auditions for TV commercials, videos and dance movies -- something 
she and her sister plan to do more of after graduation -- Cevallos finds that 
she is tougher competition to beat. 
</P>
<P>
But by taking modern dance classes and particularly by studying ballet, which 
is the most disciplined and complex of dance forms, the sisters experienced the 
paradox that signals the transformation of an amateur into a professional 
artist: They realized how little they knew. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you think you've reached the top and that's it, it's all over," Cevallos 
said. "The reason I dance is because I constantly feel as if I can't possibly 
make it to the top. There will always be more to know. And the reason I dance 
is still because I love it, because it's rewarding to make people feel better 
through dance. The reward is not money." 
</P>
<P>
"Before coming to school, everything was more materialistic," said Linda 
Cevallos, 22. "But that's not what life's about. I've discovered that what's 
important is to know yourself. CalArts has made the difference between doing 
what other people want and what I want." 
</P>
<P>
The CalArts program is designed for students who think independently. Unlike a 
college or university dance department in which the student is also expected to 
keep pace in math, English and other academic courses, the CalArts student is 
offered only courses relevant to dance. Such specialization seems to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey of university dance departments in Southern California 
reveals that while CalArts may be experiencing a growth in the number of 
applicants, since 1981, fewer students in local universities have become dance 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents want their children to be more practical. So the incoming students are 
more interested in practical careers than in self-fulfillment," said Carol 
Scothorn, chairwoman of the UCLA dance department, where enrollment is "a bit" 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"We service many more general university students than in previous years," said 
Donald Bradburn, dance lecturer at UC Irvine. "Ten years ago, some of them 
would have swung over and become dance majors, but they aren't doing it now." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Burger, 30, is a graduate student at CalArts who attended UC Irvine as an 
undergraduate dance major. She has had to cope with parents who felt that 
dancing was "too ephemeral" to be a serious profession. And when she was in her 
mid-20s, Burger caved in to the pressure and quit dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to do something else," Burger said. "But there was nothing that made 
me feel I was paying my way on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped dancing because dance is frustrating. It's frustrating not to work 
enough, to not make enough money to support yourself, to not be able to perform 
often enough. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was working for an attorney, I was more frustrated with a paycheck big 
enough to cover everything and have some luxuries," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Burger knows that she is probably too old to have an extended career as a 
performer. Like many other students at CalArts, she anticipates becoming a 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was an undergraduate, I would have laughed if you suggested I didn't 
want to be famous," she said. "I went through the whole thing of caring too 
much about how I looked -- how I pulled my hair back, how I did my makeup. But 
part of maturing is you learn to let go of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who conducts auditions for the CalArts program throughout the United 
States, attracting students from all over the globe, makes an effort not to 
overlook technically imperfect applicants. Her deeper interest is in whether 
they can choreograph. She gives each 20 minutes to make their own dance. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can think on their feet, there's hope," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Mario Tamayo, 25, arrived at CalArts last fall for his first semester as 
an undergraduate. He had been an architecture student at a junior college in 
San Diego and had taken only a year of modern dance classes. But his story and 
enthusiasm captured Lawson's imagination, and she took a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fed up with sitting down all day at my desk. I'd basically decided to 
study architecture to please my parents," Tamayo said. "One day I decided to 
take a dance class that I'd been observing. My first class I was so confused 
and stressed, I couldn't balance on one foot. 
</P>
<P>
"But the concept of spreading my arms and allowing space in -- that opened me 
up. And I realized that being unable to balance had only been a metaphor for 
what was going on inside. I was imbalanced." 
</P>
<P>
Tamayo decided to take action and, initially against his parents' wishes, 
applied to CalArts. "My parents, who immigrated to the United States after the 
Second World War, worried that if their children didn't do American things like 
football, they'd be deported. Consequently all four of my elder siblings who 
have artistic tendencies have suppressed them and are miserable. But I didn't 
and now I'm happy, and my parents are happy because they see what dancing has 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Hiroko Hojo has studied dance since age 4, when her mother led her to a 
traditional Japanese dance class near where they lived two hours south of 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"Since my life memory started, dance is always here," said Hojo, 30. "I can't 
really think not to dance." 
</P>
<P>
Hojo came to CalArts in 1985, originally as a performer in the institute's 
World Music Festival. She hung around the dorms, speaking hardly a word of 
English, and eventually persuaded Lawson to let her enroll in classes. This 
resulted in what she calls a "huge shock." 
</P>
<P>
"I was really impressed because people my age were creating dances. When I 
dance in Japan, there have got to be certain characters, certain feelings, 
certain stories," she said. "Dance is established. But here it's more like 
movement for its own sake. It's not just training for dance, it's training for 
life." 
</P>
<P>
And that, Lawson agreed, is the main purpose of the grueling hours spent in the 
dance studios at CalArts. "Dance is something you do because you have to. There 
is no rational explanation. And it doesn't matter whether the ultimate end is 
commercial dance or concert dance, as long as the students are acceptable to 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Because actually when the students leave here, all we've been able to teach 
them is how to work. You don't teach birds how to fly, after all. You feed 
them." 
</P>

KINGS ARE 4-2 LOSERS IN CALGARY 
</P>

CALGARY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings were within a goal in the second period when Calary's rookie 
defenseman, Ken Sabourin, ran Wayne Gretzky into the boards as Gretzky was 
trying to check him off the puck. 
</P>
<P>
It was chaos from that point on as the Kings lost the hockey game, 4-2, and 
worse, lost three players for the more important game back home Saturday night 
against the Edmonton Oilers, who pulled into a tie with the Kings for second 
place in the Smythe Division by winning Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli will be sitting out a suspension for a spearing penalty, his 
second stick infraction. And Jay Miller and Ken Baumgartner will be sitting out 
suspensions that resulted from the second-period brawl. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames will be without four suspended players when they play the Winnipeg 
Jets tonight -- Mark and Tim Hunter, Gary Roberts and Joel Otto. Otto is out 
for three games for seemingly attempting to strangle linesman Ron Finn later in 
the game. Mark Hunter was already suspended. 
</P>
<P>
When Gretzky landed in a crumpled heap in the corner at 12 minutes of the 
second period, to the rescue came Miller, Baumgartner, Steve Duchesne and Ron 
Duguay, tying up in a scrum with Tim Hunter, Gary Robert, Ric Nattress and 
Theoren Fleury. While the fists, sticks, gloves and helmets were flying in one 
big pileup, Gretzky came crawling out from under and tried to stand back. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as the pugilists started to square off, Gretzky tried to break it up. But 
he couldn't get all the way out of it. Gretzky, whose philosophy is that 
fighting has no place in hockey, had to try to hold at least one Flame at bay, 
because without him, the Kings were outnumbered. 
</P>
<P>
And then, just when the officials seemed to have separated the fighters to 
their respective corners, Tim Hunter flattened Gretzky right in front of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgartner reports: "It was over, and then Tim Hunter came back and hit 
Gretzky again, looking right at me, like, 'What are you going to do about 
this?' 
</P>
<P>
"I took that as a definite challenge. Sabourin hitting Gretzky? That kind of 
hit is part of the game, but we had to come over as a show of force, to show 
that that won't be tolerated. Tim Hunter hitting him again? That's a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
It was Tim Hunter who challenged Marty McSorley in the Flames' game at the 
Forum last Saturday night, so enraging McSorley that he ended up with a double 
game misconduct. Thursday night, there were 193 minutes in penalties called. 
Saturday night, there were 194, including a bunch on McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
That's why McSorley wasn't here tonight. He was afraid the Flames might try to 
take liberties with Gretzky and Co. in his absence. He was right. 
</P>
<P>
When the fisticuffs resumed, there were some strange mismatches that not even 
the shadiest of fight promoters could have dreamed up. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tim Hunter vs. Duchesne? Which left Baumgartner vs. Fleury? 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgartner said: "If Fleury wants to play with the big boys, he's going to 
have to take his lumps. But he's a tough kid." 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls didn't like the idea of Duchesne having to square off against 
one of the big boys. "Timmy Hunter was beating the hell out of Steve Duchesne. 
In the exhibition season, he was beating me up. We've got a lot of tough guys 
if Timmmy wants to fight somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, after that mood-setting brawl, there were more fights and more 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank goodness for the penalties, or we would never have scored," quipped 
Nicholls, noting that the Kings' two goals were both shorthanded goals. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wiemer, the recently acquired defenseman who scored the game-winner two 
nights earlier at Edmonton, evened the game, 1-1, at 19:26 of the first period 
after the five-minute penalty (and game misconduct) on Tonelli. 
</P>
<P>
Wiemer beat goalie Mike Vernon with a slapshot from the left faceoff circle 
that offset the goal scored by the Flames' Doug Gilmour just 1:51 into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Flames scored the next three goals, all on power plays, to take a 4-1 
lead before Steve Kasper added a shorthanded goal at 14:23 of the third period, 
while Nicholls was in the box for roughing. 
</P>
<P>
Fleury scored consecutive goals in the second and third periods, and Rob Ramage 
gave the Flames their three-goal lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings had their chances, getting 27 shots to the Flames' 33. 
</P>
<P>
Cap Raeder, the member of the Kings' coaching staff designated as spokesman, 
said: "I was encouraged by the way we played. We had a lot of good chances." 
</P>
<P>
As for the number of players lost, Raeder said the Kings would likely be 
calling to New Haven, Conn., for some emergency help. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hrudey played well in goal for the Kings, but he had no comment on the 
incident in which Otto was ejected and then suspended. It began when Otto ran 
Hrudey into the boards behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
According to King defenseman Dean Kennedy, who was on the ice at the time, Otto 
never actually punched Finn, but he had "lost it." He was on top of Finn and he 
had an arm on his throat and kept pushing him back to the ice as the other 
officials were trying to pull him off. "I've been in situations like that when 
you get that claustrophobic feeling and you just strike out at anything." 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey said: "I don't have to say anything about it. That's (Otto's) problem." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall says there is no truth to the rumor that the Kings are 
pursuing Vancouver Coach Bob McCammon. "I've heard that one, too," McNall said. 
"But I don't know where it's coming from." McCammon called the talk 
"outrageous."

LAKERS GET BALANCE BACK WITH 115-92 WIN 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sure warning sign of Laker slumps, rare as they may be, is if one player 
dominates statistically. 
</P>
<P>
Balance and consistency among his starters is the way Coach Pat Riley says he 
can accurately measure the Lakers' well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, for the first time in more than a week, the Lakers received 
quality performances from starters and reserves. The result was a 115-92 
victory over the Sacramento Kings before 16,517 fans at the Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The last four games, we've been inconsistent," Riley said. "We haven't been 
getting balance. One guy plays well, but two or three play poorly. You can't 
win that way." 
</P>
<P>
Riley's solution to the Lakers' woes, which included two consecutive home 
losses preceded by two unimpressive close home victories, was to remove his 
starters temporarily at the first sign of slippage. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the team before the game and I told them I was going to play a lot 
of people and see who could perform consistently," Riley said. "Let some of 
them sit a minute or two and think about it. I told them that's the way it was 
going to be for a while." 
</P>
<P>
No Laker regular sat for too long on this night. Despite a shaky first half, in 
which they struggled to take a three-point lead, the Lakers hit the floor 
running in the second half and increased the lead to 13 points heading into the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, when Riley perused the box score afterward, he saw the balance 
about which he had spoken before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, coming off what both he and Riley called an inconsistent 
performance in the previous two losses, recorded his 14th triple-double of the 
season. Johnson had 25 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds. He was particularly 
impressive in the third quarter, when he scored 11 points, including 
consecutive three-point shots that pushed the Laker lead to 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy, shrugging off a poor start, finished with 22 points. He made 9 of 
14 shots, getting hot in the second quarter during the Lakers' comeback. 
Support also came from Byron Scott, who had 20 points, and A.C. Green, who had 
15 rebounds while playing just three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Benefiting from Riley's expanded substitution policy were Orlando Woolridge, 
who scored all 13 of his points in the fourth quarter, and Tony Campbell, who 
scored eight points in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I had not been playing as well as I'd like to the last couple of games," 
Johnson said. "So, tonight, I just wanted to get back into the flow of my game, 
get out running. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was into their games tonight. That was a difference. We need five or 
six guys playing well every game, not just one or two. Everybody was doing it 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, at least. A consistent effort for a full game once again 
eluded the Lakers, but this time they reversed a recent trend by playing poorly 
in the first half and dominating the second. 
</P>
<P>
After making just 40% of their shots in the first half, the Lakers emerged from 
their daze to dazzle the Kings in the third and fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
A renewed emphasis on stopping Sacramento's perimeter shooting -- Danny Ainge 
made only 1 of 7 shots in the third quarter after scoring 12 points in the 
first half -- resulted in a series of Laker fast-break baskets. 
</P>
<P>
At one point midway through the third quarter, the Lakers scored three straight 
baskets via the fast break, Scott and Johnson converting off missed King shots 
and Green scoring on a layup after the Kings made a shot. 
</P>
<P>
That sequence was immediately followed by Johnson's long-distance shooting 
display. The Lakers had a 73-60 lead with just under three minutes in the third 
quarter, when Johnson dribbled upcourt and sank a three-point shot with 2:45 to 
play. That gave the Lakers a 16-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Kenny Smith, who led King scorers with 21 points, countered with a drive 
for a basket. Then Johnson did in the Kings for good by sinking another 
three-point shot 40 seconds after the first for a 79-62 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Sacramento came after that was 12 points early in the fourth 
quarter. The Kings shot just 40% and were outrebounded, 56-41. And the Lakers 
made better than 50% of their shots (52.7%) for the first time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
It became such a Laker runaway that seldom-used reserves Mark McNamara and Jeff 
Lamp successfully executed their give-and-go wraparound pass through the lane 
for the first time since unveiling it earlier in the month in a rout of the 
Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
So, if all is not totally right yet in the Lakers' world, at least they could 
forget that poor first half and dwell on their second. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to have hard times (in a game), have it early," Scott said. 
"But this team has a lot of pride. We can take care of business when we have 
to. That's what we did in the second half tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar made the 17th stop on his farewell tour. To honor 
Abdul-Jabbar, the Kings established an annual scholarship in his name at Cal 
State Sacramento. The scholarship will be awarded to a student based on 
financial need and commitment to fighting illiteracy among underprivileged 
youth in the Sacramento area. Gov. George Deukmejian and King owner Gregg 
Lukenbill presided over the ceremony, which delayed the start of the game for 
30 minutes. "This is a man who is highly talented and very gifted as an 
individual," said Deukmejian, who also presented Abdul-Jabbar with a 
commemorative desk clock. "Going beyond all of his records is the fact he's a 
real champion. He's a genuine individual, a person who carries a quiet dignity. 
. . . On behalf of all the people, we want to thank him for all the enjoyment 
he has brought to California, starting at UCLA and continuing with the Lakers." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar said he has followed the Kings' franchise through many changes. 
"My relationship (with the Kings) goes a long way back -- too long, it's almost 
embarrassing," he said. "I remember listening to the Knick games on the radio 
against Rochester, which was this franchise. I remember playing against 
Cincinnati, and that was this team. Then, I remember Omaha and Kansas City. 
Finally, (the franchise) has a home. I think this is probably the best place 
they could be." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley, who played college basketball at the University of 
Kentucky, said he expected the rumors that he was a candidate for the vacant 
coaching position. "It happened before, about three or four years ago," Riley 
said. "I was rumored to be going there. It's the same thing. I'm not going." 
</P>
<P>
Strange statistic of the day: Before Thursday night, in four games against the 
Sacramento Kings, Laker forward A.C. Green had made 17 of 27 shots. Less 
impressive, Green also had made 17 of 27 free throws.

UNLV TAKES ARIZONA OUT OF THE HUNT; 
</P>
<P>
REBELS WIN ON A 3-POINT SHOT, 68-67 
</P>

<P>
If it had seemed clear that Nevada Las Vegas was the type of team that might 
beat Arizona, it was also clear that the Rebels were the type of team liable to 
botch the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely what seemed to be happening as the Rebels frittered away the 
final 30 seconds of their West Regional semifinal against top-seeded Arizona 
Thursday night. The Rebels trailed by two points as the last handful of seconds 
ticked by. 
</P>
<P>
The clock showed only 10 seconds remaining, and UNLV's Anderson Hunt still had 
the ball outside the three-point line, where he was being guarded by Ken 
Lofton. But they bumped, and Lofton went to the floor. Hunt looked down, then 
back toward the basket. He pivoted, squared and shot. It found the net for 
three points and a 68-67 UNLV victory before a crowd of 16,813 at McNichols 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The second that went off his hand, it looked to me like it was dead-center," 
Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
And it was. 
</P>
<P>
That shot broke a UNLV scoring drought of more than five minutes, during which 
the Rebels squandered a 65-58 lead. Sean Elliott had hit one of his trademark 
fastbreak three-pointers to cut the lead to two, and Arizona took the lead 
shortly thereafter on Matt Muehlebach's follow shot with 1:35 left. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona had the ball with less than a minute left when Muehlebach was called 
for traveling, turning the ball over to UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
After a timeout, the Rebels brought the ball in with the idea of getting it to 
George Ackles or David Butler -- or going for the three-pointer and the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to take time off the clock," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "But 
I'd rather take a three than a two at that point because we're the underdogs. 
If we're the favorite, we play to tie and go to overtime." 
</P>
<P>
Overtime was not in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an excellent basketball game, and I think if we had won, you would 
say we had played hard and well," Olson said. "UNLV certainly played hard and 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that down the stretch we did a great job, down to that final -- that 
final shot. Even on the final possession, we had great defensive position. But 
when Kenny went down, it gave him (Hunt) the room he needed to put it down." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who made five three-pointers and scored 21 points, hit the final shot 
with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him falling, and I shot the three," Hunt said. "I looked down once I saw 
him falling, and I just shot it. . . . Did I think the last shot was going in? 
Yeah, since we won I can say that. But it could have gone either way. I've been 
in a slump. It could have gone either way. . . . Soon as he fell, I looked 
down. Then I just staggered back, and shot the ball." 
</P>
<P>
After a series of timeouts with two seconds left, Arizona threw a desperation 
baseball pass. But George Ackles intercepted it and passed it down to Hunt, who 
danced through the lane, his index finger in the air. 
</P>
<P>
This game was all the more intense because of Arizona's 86-75 victory over UNLV 
in December, when Elliott had 32 points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was different. 
</P>
<P>
"This game, our plan was to try to deny Elliott the ball, and if he got it, to 
play with a cushion. Keep in front of him and don't go for the fake," Tarkanian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, as Stacey Augmon exhibited the skills that have made his 
defensive reputation, that was what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Stacey played absolutely perfect defense in the first half," 
Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott had only six points by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to credit their defense," Elliott said. "They did an outstanding 
job helping out and not letting me do the things I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the Rebels were less successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Stacey started climbing on him a little bit in the second half," Tarkanian 
said. "When you start climbing him, he's just going to go right by you." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott finished with 22 points and 14 rebounds. Anthony Cook scored 12 points, 
and Jud Buechler added 10. 
</P>
<P>
Butler scored 16 points for UNLV, and Augmon had 15, nine more than he scored 
against Arizona in the first game this season. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended Arizona's attempt to return to the Final Four for a second 
straight year, and the Wildcats finished with a 29-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a season-ending loss," Olson said. "Yes, it's bitter." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, trying to return to the Final Four for the second time in three years, 
will face SetonHall Saturday in the Regional final.

MISSOURI APPEARS TO BE ON A MISSION WITH ASSISTANT SERVING AS INTERIM COACH

<P>
The University of Missouri's basketball team, pride of the Show Me State, has 
shown it can overcome turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, who play Syracuse in a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Midwest 
Regional semifinal game tonight at the Metrodome, have made headlines more 
suited to the supermarket tabloids than the sports pages this season. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Kansas City Star-Times had 
published stories examining Missouri's recruiting tactics, Coach Norm Stewart 
allegedly threatened the infant son of Jim Thomas, who reports on Missouri for 
the Post-Dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you trying to hurt me?" Stewart reportedly asked Thomas after a practice 
Jan. 4. "Do you love Timmy? I know some people who can do something about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has denied making the threat, which was reported by the Columbia 
Missourian. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Assistant coach Bob Sundvold was suspended Feb. 8 after admitting having 
paid for a plane ticket for P. J. Mayes, a freshman guard who has since left 
school because he didn't meet NCAA academic standards. The NCAA is 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Sundvold would not be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stewart, 57, passed out on a charter flight to a game at Oklahoma on Feb. 
9. The plane made an emergency landing, and Stewart was hospitalized with a 
bleeding ulcer. When tests also revealed a cancerous tumor on the colon and a 
diseased gallbladder, Stewart underwent surgery. He is recuperating at home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rich Daly, Missouri's only remaining full-time assistant coach, was 
elevated to interim head coach. 
</P>
<P>
And Daly has led Missouri, which hadn't won a postseason game in five years, to 
the NCAA sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
"Missouri seems to be playing on some kind of mission," Tom Penders, Texas 
coach, said after losing to Missouri by 19 points in a second-round game last 
weekend. "They're really a motivated ballclub. I wouldn't be surprised to see 
them make it to (the Final Four)." 
</P>
<P>
Penders credits Daly for Missouri's resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
"Daly's not trying to over-coach. And I think that's smart. I think he has 
asserted some authority. I watched him during the games before we played him 
and I got the feeling that if a (player's) not doing his job, Daly's going to 
take him out of there. It's a very difficult situation that he came into, but I 
think he's taken the attitude that he has everything to gain and nothing to 
lose. And that's the proper way of going about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rich Daly picked up the phone to call home. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, his fingers froze. 
</P>
<P>
"What's my home phone number?" Daly asked a reporter. "Three months ago, I 
could rattle off 150 phone numbers but my mind has been shot since I took this 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Daly has also forgotten to eat and sleep. He spends hours tossing and turning, 
thinking about games. 
</P>
<P>
He used to sleep like a baby when he was Missouri's chief recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
"When things got bad around here, I'd just get a plane ticket and get out of 
Dodge City to recruit," Daly said. "I don't care how good a coach you are, you 
can't win the Kentucky Derby with a Missouri mule." 
</P>
<P>
He was nicknamed Dr. Detroit for his success in signing the seven Tigers who 
call Detroit home. 
</P>
<P>
"Rich Daly is the world's greatest recruiter," Derrick Chievous, a former 
Missouri star, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. "Rich Daly could sell you a 
pair of bad underwear, that's what kind of recruiter he is." 
</P>
<P>
A tireless recruiter who calls seven recruits seven nights a week, Daly has 
easily made the transition to bench coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaching is like riding a bicycle," Daly said. "You never forget how to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
When did he learn to coach? 
</P>
<P>
A native of Moberly, Mo., Daly, 47, began his coaching career at Moberly High. 
He moved on to Moberly Junior College, where he was an assistant under Cotton 
Fitzsimmons, now coach of the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Daly's next stop was Pensacola Junior College in Florida, where he spent six 
years as head coach before leaving for Tennessee Chattanooga, where he spent 
five years as an assistant coach-recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
Daly, who arrived at Missouri in 1983, recruited all of the players on this 
year's squad, which is a mix of inner-city players from Detroit and small-town 
players from Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smith, center from Detroit, arrived at practice the other day wearing a 
coonskin cap, and monster cables, the thick gold rope chains favored by rap 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug's the only guy I know who looks good with a squirrel sitting on top of 
his head," quipped Gary Leonard, senior center. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Church, a senior forward from Palmyra, Mo., looked as if he was ready to 
go deer hunting when he arrived at practice in jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their cultural differences, the two factions peacefully coexist on and 
off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a weird chemistry," said Leonard. "But I think that's what's helped 
us through all this. Everybody's unique, but we all blend together on and off 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Stewart ruled this eccentric bunch with an iron hand, Daly's touch has 
been kinder and gentler. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be Norm Stewart," Daly said. "I've got to be Rich Daly." 
</P>
<P>
So who is Rich Daly? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he comes across as a refreshing change from workaholic coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas many other college coaches are consumed by their jobs, watching tape 
and conducting long meetings and practices, Daly disdains such tactics. His 
well-organized workouts rarely last longer than 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
After replacing Stewart, Daly gave the seniors a role in planning game 
strategy. But the experiment in coaching by committee failed. Missouri, which 
had won 19 of its first 22 games under Stewart, finished the regular season by 
splitting its last eight under Daly. 
</P>
<P>
So Daly began to assert his authority. 
</P>
<P>
He benched guard Byron Irvin, the team's leading scorer, after Irvin had been 
late for practice, and although the players chafed when Daly tightened the 
reins, the new tactics have been productive. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have won six straight in the postseason, including NCAA tournament 
wins over Creighton and Texas. After finishing second to Oklahoma in the Big 
Eight, Missouri won the conference tournament, beating Oklahoma in the final. 
</P>
<P>
So Daly's stock has risen, although he says he'll be content to return to being 
an assistant coach when Stewart returns. Still, Daly aspires to become a head 
coach eventually and realizes that the kind of publicity he is generating can 
help his cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Any assistant that says he doesn't want to be a head coach is lying," Daly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Has Daly's performance helped him? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I haven't gotten any letters. But I don't know if I'd 
want a job at a place that would send me a letter." 
</P>
<P>
For 22 years, Norm Stewart was Missouri basketball. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Tigers on the road to Seattle, he has kept a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not doing (interviews)," Stewart told a reporter who phoned him at home. 
</P>
<P>
When the reporter persisted, Stewart quickly ended the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't understand," Stewart said. "Rich Daly has been appointed interim 
coach and he's doing a wonderful job handling the team. Nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Click. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart did consent to go on a statewide radio talk show last weekend, where he 
made his first public statements since he was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting stronger and I feel good about everything," Stewart said. "Having 
major surgery, I just needed to get back and convalesce and get myself well. I 
try to do everything I can to help my ballclub. But at the same time, I felt, 
one of the first priorities was that I'd better take care of myself. Now that 
I've had a little time, feel stronger . . . it's fine to watch the ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart attended a workout last week and when the team returned home from last 
Sunday's game in Dallas, he met them at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
What did Stewart tell the team? 
</P>
<P>
"He was giving us words of wisdom in his old style," said Church. "It was like 
nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
In reality, though, lots has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Midwest Regional Notes 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (29-4), which meets Louisville (24-8) in the opening game, got a scare 
when forward Kenny Battle twisted his right knee after he slipped on a wet spot 
during Thursday's practice. He's expected to play tonight. Why was the floor 
wet? The Metrodome's roof was leaking. Metrodome officials hope to have it 
fixed by today.

<P>
It's another big weekend for college basketball, but there are a couple of 
other sports programs that deserve attention. 
</P>
<P>
One is Saturday night's Michael Nunn-Sumbu Kalambay middleweight title fight at 
the Las Vegas Hilton on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
The other is a taped adventure film with, of all people, Tim McCarver as host. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim McCarver's World of Adventure," not to be confused with "Pee Wee Herman's 
Big Adventure," is a fascinating film that, in parts, makes the movie, "Jaws," 
look tame. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/2-hour show will be on ABC Sunday at 3:30 p.m., which is right in the 
middle of the college basketball on CBS, so crank up the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
First, a look at the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Greenburg, executive producer of HBO Sports, calls it, "A coming-out party 
for both fighters." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, although widely known in Southern California, is hardly a household name 
elsewhere. His two big fights, against Frank Tate and Juan Roldan, were seen by 
a limited audience on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons Nunn's manager, Dan Goossen, made a two-fight deal with 
HBO was to give his fighter more national exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Nunn, the undefeated International Boxing Federation middleweight 
champion, is considerably better known than Kalambay, who is originally from 
Zaire but now fights out of Italy. He is 46-3-1 with 26 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Kalambay beat Iran Barkley to win the World Boxing Assn. middleweight 
title, which he has been stripped of for supposedly not defending it soon 
enough. But that doesn't really detract much from this matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Said Greenburg: "This should be one heck of a fight. We have two of the most 
gifted athletes in the ring, although neither has gotten the recognition he 
deserves." 
</P>
<P>
HBO's original two-bout, $2.5-million deal with Nunn called for him to fight 
the winner of last month's Roberto Duran-Barkley fight. But that fight turned 
out to be so good that promoter Bob Arum, according to Greenburg, went back to 
HBO and asked if Nunn instead would fight the loser, Barkley, sometime this 
summer, provided Nunn beats Kalambay. 
</P>
<P>
Arum apparently has bigger plans for Duran, such as pitting him against the 
winner of the June 12 Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns bout. 
</P>
<P>
HBO, given financial incentive, agreed to the switch, although Goossen says 
nothing is definite. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concentrating on Kalambay, and haven't looked beyond this fight," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins Saturday night will join Leonard, Duran and Hearns as the other 
big name in the middleweight picture. 
</P>
<P>
If it's Nunn, a Leonard-Nunn fight down the road, provided both get past other 
hurdles first, would figure as a pay-per-view blockbuster along the lines of 
Leonard-Marvin Hagler and Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
HBO's prefight coverage Saturday starts at 7 p.m. No undercard fights will be 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
With the main event scheduled for 7:23, HBO will have plenty of time to profile 
Nunn and Kalambay. HBO even sent a crew to Chiaravalle, Italy, where Kalambay 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Hackman, one of the many Hollywood stars belonging to Nunn's growing fan 
club, will be among those interviewed during the Nunn profile. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the fight will be HBO's regular team of Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant 
and Leonard. It will be Leonard's last assignment for HBO before he goes into 
training for the Hearns fight. 
</P>
<P>
Lampley, who switched from sports to news last summer, views the HBO job as a 
perfect way for him to maintain ties to the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
"During my final year and a half at ABC, I was really getting into boxing," he 
said. "Now I am fortunate enough to have the No. 1 boxing job in the country, 
and it is conducive to my schedule." 
</P>
<P>
His last HBO assignment was the Tyson-Frank Bruno fight Feb. 24, and his next 
one after Nunn-Kalambay will be April 15, when Marlon Starling and Mark Breland 
meet for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
Might Lampley, a Channel 2 news anchorman, someday go back to sports full time? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't at this time imagine doing that," he said. "If I had to choose between 
giving up sports or giving up news, I would give up sports." 
</P>
<P>
Tim's Big Adventure: McCarver was in Los Angeles this week to promote Sunday's 
show, which was produced and directed by Pierre de Lespinois. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think they would have gotten an expert to host this show," McCarver 
said. "I am anything but an expert." 
</P>
<P>
In the show, most of which was taped a year ago, McCarver, who admits to a 
healthy fear of the ocean, goes snorkeling with sea lions in shark-infested 
waters off South Australia, goes scuba diving in the Cayman Islands in the 
Caribbean, and goes to depths of 800 feet in a mini-submarine. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I refused to do was be dropped by rope from helicopter onto a 
glacier," he said. "You know, I've got to think about self-preservation." 
</P>
<P>
During a feature on speed skiing, McCarver braves 75-m.p.h. winds in a wind 
tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"That was tough, really tough," he said. "I had to squat and lean forward for 
four or five minutes, and I got a cramp. You'd think a guy who used to make a 
living squatting behind a plate wouldn't have trouble squatting, but this was a 
lot different." 
</P>
<P>
The most amazing footage is in the show's final segment. A great white shark 
actually swallows a camera, enabling viewers to see its insides. 
</P>
<P>
The camera, McCarver explained, was connected to a pole and pulled from the 
shark. The camera obviously was heavily damaged, and it wasn't known if the 
film was good until the crew got back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
The great white shark segment focuses on Australian Rodney Fox, who began 
studying sharks after surviving an attack in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wade and Debbie Boggs are interviewed by Barbara Walters on tonight's "20/20" 
on ABC at 10 p.m. Debbie is asked if she trusts her husband. "Hmmm. I don't 
think I'll ever have to go through this again because I don't think he would 
hurt me. He knows how bad it hurt me and he loves me too much. I don't think he 
would put me through it again." Boggs, asked how he feels about former mistress 
Margo Adams, says: "Well, I can honestly say I hate her for what's she's done." 
</P>
<P>
"Play Ball With Reggie Jackson," a Saturday morning kid-oriented show which 
begins a 13-week run on ESPN April 1, was originally "Play Ball With Steve 
Garvey." Both the show's sponsor and ESPN decided a change of hosts was 
appropriate. . . . NBC and Vin Scully are close to a deal in which Scully would 
remain with the network as a golf announcer after CBS begins doing baseball in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Caray was a guest announcer on KMPC Thursday during the Angels' 9-1 loss 
to the Chicago Cubs, and later Angel announcer Ken Brett did a pretty good 
Caray imitation. . . . The Nabisco Dinah Shore women's golf tournament, which 
begins next Thursday at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, will 
have all four rounds televised -- the first two on ESPN, the final two on NBC. 
. . . Are you ready for this? Eddie (the Eagle) Edwards is one of the 
announcers for the taped ski-jumping coverage on ABC's "Wide World of Sports" 
Saturday. The Iditarod sled-dog race is the featured segment.

OK OF INSTANT REPLAY IS A PRESENT FOR ROZELLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PALM DESERT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the owners of the National Football League's 28 teams arrived here last 
weekend, the chance for instant replay officiating this fall was as dead as the 
desert surrounding their convention oasis. 
</P>
<P>
At least 12 owners had lined up against renewal and only eight were needed to 
kill it. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Pete Rozelle was for it. 
</P>
<P>
And at Thursday's final session, as Rozelle presided for the last time at these 
winter meetings, the owners decided, 24-4, to keep instant replay for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"(They) acquiesced to the wishes of the commissioner," Raider owner Al Davis 
said afterward. "And that was only fitting." 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle, who resigned suddenly Wednesday in his 30th year in charge, was asked 
if he considered the vote a farewell present. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have got it (without the resignation)," he said. "But it was easier 
this way." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the last chapter in a week of wrangling over instant replay brought a 
typical Rozelle compromise. 
</P>
<P>
He and most of the members of the competition committee were pressing for the 
adoption of TV replays as a permanent feature of NFL officiating. 
</P>
<P>
They were also pressing for a recently perfected technological improvement -- a 
method of instantaneously transferring the sound of the officials' whistles to 
the replay screen. 
</P>
<P>
"But this (technology) would have been too costly for some teams," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
And with a permanent instant-replay rule, the 12-team minority would lose its 
privilege to dominate the majority. A permanent rule requires 21 votes to 
overturn, not eight. 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle decided in the late morning to try for two-thirds of a loaf. 
</P>
<P>
"If we make (instant replay) for another one year only, and if we throw out the 
whistle (technology), who's for it?" he asked the owners. "Let's have a show of 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
When 21 hands went up, Rozelle said: "Motion carried." 
</P>
<P>
For the last three decades, under a commissioner who was 33 when he started in 
1960, the NFL has been doing business that way -- seldom pleasing everyone, but 
seldom really angering anyone, either. 
</P>
<P>
The minority teams, as usual, were allowed to change their votes before the 
result was etched in the book. That left as the opposition only the four 
hard-core dissenters, the Cincinnati Bengals, New York Giants, Phoenix 
Cardinals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle was asked what he had enjoyed the most about the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching the development of the Super Bowl," he said. "We bombed, you know, 
with the first one (in 1967) in Los Angeles. We couldn't sell it out at $7.50. 
But in (recent years), I've felt a high -- to use a term -- each Sunday of the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Who was the greatest player of your time? 
</P>
<P>
"In the last decade, it was probably Walter Payton -- his playing ability and 
as a person." 
</P>
<P>
Your biggest regret? 
</P>
<P>
"Playing those games on Kennedy Sunday -- the Sunday after President Kennedy 
died. My classmate, Pierre Salinger, (a close Kennedy associate), recommended 
that we play, but I wish I hadn't. It has caused too much controversy." 
</P>
<P>
Why do you say the next 30 years will be greater for the NFL than your 30 
years? 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the impact the game will have internationally. With the expansion 
of teams and cable channels, it will become truly worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
What advice do you have for your successor? 
</P>
<P>
"Stay loose." 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle said he started with the Rams in the 1940s at $5,500 a year as an 
assistant publicist. Thereafter, his salary doubled on each rung as he went up 
the ladder, to $12,500 as public relations director of the Rams, to $25,000 as 
their general manager, and to $50,000 as commissioner in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
He is giving up a salary of $1 million now to move into retirement in 
California, where he and his wife Carrie plan to build their new house on a 
two-acre parcel they own at Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
As the owners considered the possibility of hiring two persons for Rozelle's 
job this time, he brushed off two related questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about (it)," he said first. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when asked why he hasn't participated as an arbitrator or adviser in the 
NFL's lengthy, current labor war, he said: "That's not my function." 
</P>
<P>
Some football people, including the Raiders' Davis, think it is. 
</P>
<P>
"(Rozelle) has the power to get in there," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
But most owners agree with Rozelle that an NFL labor fight is between them and 
the players, and that the commissioner lacks a constitutional mandate to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, that is a primary reason why, henceforth, some of them want an NFL 
president as well as a commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
In the present labor fuss, the owners' side of the argument is being carried by 
the management council, whose director is Jack Donlan. 
</P>
<P>
The players object to this arrangement, arguing that Donlan is too far removed 
from the owners to be speaking for them. 
</P>
<P>
An NFL president, on the other hand, would have the prestige as well as the 
power to bargain with the players -- and with the television networks as well, 
among other businesses -- leaving the new commissioner to take charge in such 
areas as morals, integrity and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Art Modell, president of the Cleveland Browns, sees it about that way. Lamar 
Hunt, president of the Kansas City Chiefs, said he's heard all that but is 
still open-minded. 
</P>
<P>
Modell and Hunt were named to the committee to search for a new commissioner, 
as were Wellington Mara, president of the New York Giants; Dan Rooney, 
president of the Pittsburgh Steelers; Ralph Wilson, president of the Buffalo 
Bills, and Judge Robert J. Parins, retiring president of the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for some of the younger, newer owners objected immediately that this 
is an old-guard committee.

LAZERS FACE COMETS IN RETURN TO FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having ended a three-game trip Wednesday by losing to the Kansas City Comets, 
the Lazers hope to get back on track tonight at 8 at the Forum against those 
same Comets. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City, which swept the Lazers out of the opening round of last season's 
playoffs, has won three of five against the Lazers this season, and Wednesday's 
6-3 victory moved the Comets a half-game ahead of the Lazers in the Major 
Indoor Soccer League standings. 
</P>
<P>
About the only bright spot for the Lazers, who have lost five of their last six 
games, has been the play of Hector Marinaro, the league's top goal-scorer with 
42. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers (18-21) have nine games remaining, including two against the Comets 
(17-19).

Doug Rader kept staring at the scoreboard beyond the outfield fence at Angels 
Stadium Thursday afternoon, as if the numbers were going to change. 
</P>
<P>
Cubs 9, Angels 1. Fourteen hits by the visitors. Three errors by the home team. 
</P>
<P>
"What a day," Rader said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the highlight was Lance Parrish's slide into second base," he added, 
recalling how his catcher had broken up a double play in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
"That's lunging a little, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
The Angel manager had just watched his pitching staff absorb another pounding, 
with starter Kirk McCaskill unable to complete his scheduled six-inning round 
and reliever Stewart Cliburn knocked around for five runs in the seventh 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, the team's earned-run average was 5.01. During the club's first 
week here, the Angels have won games by scores of 9-8, 7-6, 7-6 and 4-3 -- and 
have lost games by scores of 12-7, 3-2 and 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
The individual ERAs of the projected rotation: Mike Witt 3.86; Bert Blyleven 
4.29; Chuck Finley 4.50; Dan Petry 12.71; McCaskill 4.79. 
</P>
<P>
The individual ERAs of the projected bullpen behind Bryan Harvey: Willie Fraser 
4.15; Greg Minton 5.63; Bob McClure 0.96; Cliburn 5.40. 
</P>
<P>
Rader was asked if the numbers were starting to affect his blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"No, that really doesn't trouble me," he insisted. "I've got an awful lot of 
confidence in the real nucleus of our pitching staff, the people who are 
pitching the greatest number of innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring training ERAs are a little bit misleading. I really think there are two 
things to keep in mind -- one, you'll never score as many runs during the 
season as you do in the spring, and, two, you'll never give up as many runs. 
</P>
<P>
"The higher ERA generally reflects on three or four people, and if those people 
are vying for jobs, that doesn't speaking highly for their chances." 
</P>
<P>
Include Cliburn in the latter category. The lone holdover from last season's 
opening-day bullpen, Cliburn was victimized by weak defense Thursday -- one of 
the five runs he allowed was earned -- but still looked ragged to Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"He got the ball up," Rader said. "When Stu gets hurt, it's because of (pitch) 
location. Some people can get away with the ball up there, but Stu's not one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Did the outing dash Cliburn's chances of retaining his long-relief position? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it can be that final. That would not be fair," Rader said. "But, 
in all honesty, it certainly doesn't help." 
</P>
<P>
And McCaskill, who threw 105 pitches in 5 2/3 innings, surrendering four runs 
in the process? 
</P>
<P>
"We all know he was behind in the count too much," Rader said. "It seemed he 
was pitching to every hitter, three-and-one, three-and-two. Pitching like that 
is a difficult proposition. No, it's stronger than that -- impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's a tough kid and a competitor by nature. Generally, those kind of 
people find a way. I have a great deal of confidence he'll solve the riddle." 
</P>
<P>
Only 11 more solving days until the season opener.

Pitcher Dwight Gooden of the New York Mets has reached a settlement with the 
city of Tampa, Fla., and three police officers over a brawl during his arrest 
more than two years ago, Gooden's agent, Jim Neader, said. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden was pulled over by Tampa police for erratic driving on Dec. 13, 1986. A 
brawl ensued between Gooden, four friends and police. Gooden later pleaded no 
contest to assault charges stemming from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden filed suit against the city of Tampa and the police for injuries he 
sustained, and countersuits were filed. Neader said all parties dropped the 
suits, but he did not disclose details of the settlements.

NEWSWIRE: LEWIS CRITICIZES JOHNSON, SAYS OTHER SEOUL MEDALISTS ALSO USED 
STEROIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Track star Carl Lewis said Thursday that Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson could 
not have made the Canadian Olympic team without the help of anabolic steroids 
and called for a stepped-up war against use of the performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was awarded the 100-meter gold medal in the 1988 Olympics after Johnson, 
who had run the distance in a world-record time of 9.79 seconds, was 
disqualified when he tested positive for steroid use. Lewis made his remarks in 
testimony at a hearing of a House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Johnson would not have been in the finals or even on the Olympic team" if 
he had not been taking steroids, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee is considering legislation to bar mail and other advertising 
of steroids. The measure would reinforce legislation passed last year, making 
it a federal crime to prescribe steroids without a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis estimated that five to 10 medals were won in the Seoul Games because of 
steroid use. Responding to a question by Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Lewis did 
not name the other steroid users he believed won track and field medals but 
said, "To add to that, some of them were gold medalists, definitely." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Johnson's doctor said that steroid use is rampant throughout all 
sports and asked that the banned drugs be legalized. 
</P>
<P>
"Every athlete in Seoul was on them," Dr. Jamie Astaphan said in an interview 
from his home on St. Kitts in the Caribbean. "If there was any athlete not on 
them, they were probably from Sri Lanka or Timbuktu or some other God-forsaken 
place."

U.S., SOVIET UNION AGREE ON DRUG TESTS, VERIFICATION PROCEDURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an agreement similar to the one signed last year by their governments 
regarding strategic arms reduction, officials of the United States and Soviet 
Union Olympic committees Thursday announced details of a plan that would enable 
doctors to monitor drug tests of athletes in each other's countries. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning as soon as August, athletes in both countries could be tested not 
only during and immediately after competition, which has been the normal 
procedure since international testing was instituted in 1968, but also during 
training periods with only 48 hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the agreement were announced by Baaron Pittenger, U.S. Olympic 
Committee executive director, in a news conference at the UCLA Medical Center 
after three days of meetings on the campus involving seven U.S. and Soviet 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Before going into effect, the agreement must be approved by the USOC's 
executive board, which will meet June 3-4 at Des Moines, Iowa. Pittenger said 
that he does not anticipate significant opposition to the program, which he 
estimated will cost the USOC $250,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tremendously important because of the problem of drugs in sports, 
which was magnified and focused by the Ben Johnson incident but, in fact, was 
universally recognized by sports leaders throughout the world before that," 
Pittenger said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the leaders of the sports world in the East and the leaders of the sports 
world in the West can get together, we can create the atmosphere for a 
successful effort throughout the world." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet officials signed an agreement to wage a bilateral war against 
anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs at Seoul last October, 
less than a week after Johnson, the Canadian sprinter who won the Olympic 100 
meters, had been disqualified because of his positive test for a steroid. 
Negotiations began last November at Moscow and resumed Tuesday at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Although the stakes are vastly different, it was inevitable, because of the 
countries involved, that the negotiations would be compared in the 
international sports world to the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks between Ronald 
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. One U.S. delegate, Dr. Donald Catlin, director of 
the UCLA Paul Ziffren Olympic Analytical Laboratory, even repeated a Reagan 
line when discussing the basic philosophy of the steroid disarmament agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Trust, but verify," Catlin said. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, verification would be provided by doctors who specialize in the 
analysis of drug tests. A U.S. doctor would be based in Moscow, and a Soviet 
doctor would be based in Los Angeles. Both cities have laboratories approved by 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Among other details: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Each Olympic committee would be able to select specific athletes in the 
other country for testing, which could take place at senior or junior meets, 
training camps or during training. The doctors would be allowed to follow the 
entire testing process, beginning with the collection of an athlete's urine 
sample and ending with the laboratory analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Drugs specifically targeted in the agreement are anabolic steroids, masking 
agents and diuretics. Diuretics dilute urine, complicating the detection of 
other substances. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Athletes chosen for testing during training would be given 48 hours' 
notice. They could be tested at locations near their homes or they could be 
asked to report to the nearest IOC-approved laboratory. Their expenses would be 
paid. An athlete who failed to comply and does not have a valid excuse would 
face the same penalties as one who tests positive, a two-year suspension for 
the first offense and a lifetime suspension for a subsequent offense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Administrators, coaches or doctors found to have aided athletes in the use 
of banned substances also would face possible lifetime suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
If the agreement is approved by the USOC in June, Pittenger said that testing 
will be done in both countries in August and September. Officials from both 
countries will discuss the results at an international anti-doping conference 
in October at Moscow, during which other countries will be asked to join the 
agreement. Pittenger said that East Germany, West Germany and Italy already 
have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility to make sure that the rest of the world follows us," 
he said. "If we're unsuccessful at that, we've placed our athletes at a 
disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
Vasily Gromyko, deputy chairman of the Soviet Union's Committee for Physical 
Culture and Sports, echoed that concern. 
</P>
<P>
"We must guarantee our athletes that competitors in other countries will not be 
in an advantageous position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he believes the agreement will be supported by Soviet 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the members of our national teams aware of the agreement," he said 
through an interpreter. "Many athletes expressed a willingness to go even 
further." 
</P>
<P>
Whether U.S. athletes will be as enthusiastic remains to be seen, although 
hurdler Edwin Moses, a U.S. delegate, said that he expects the agreement to 
receive the endorsement of the USOC's Athletes Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last November with the New York Times, the Soviet Union's 
sports minister, Marat Gramov, revealed that about 300 Soviet athletes, some 
elite, were disqualified from national events in the last three years for 
failing drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
Gramov said that many athletes reported that they used drugs because they 
believed competitors from other countries were enhancing their performances 
with banned substances. Many U.S. athletes have presented the same 
rationalization, pointing fingers at Soviet Bloc athletes in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of trust has not always existed between the United States and the 
Soviet Union," said Dr. Ralph Hale, president of U.S. Water Polo and a member 
of the U.S. delegation. "But they seem to trust us, and we seem to trust them. 
Maybe some of the athletes and the officials in different sports will have 
difficulties with that concept." 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said that technicians will tour the Moscow and UCLA laboratories in June 
and July and make recommendations for improving them.

Ryan, 42, who signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers last December 
for a guaranteed $2 million, said he felt the pull as he ran to cover first 
base for Tulsa of the Class AA Texas League, which was playing a Baltimore farm 
team. Ryan faced three batters, throwing 14 pitches, before departing.

Dale Ellis scored 10 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter, including a 
go-ahead layin with 41 seconds left, as the Seattle SuperSonics beat the 
Clippers, 115-112, Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, who scored 31 points in the SuperSonics' 101-96 win over Utah Tuesday 
night, broke a 109-109 tie with his layup on a feed from Nate McMillan. Xavier 
McDaniel's dunk with 21 seconds remaining put Seattle ahead, 113-109. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who got a career-high 24 points from Eric White off the bench and 
21 from starter Quintin Dailey, closed to 113-112 on a three-point shot by 
Ennis Whatley. But free throws by Derrick McKey and John Lucas, and a steal by 
Sedale Threatt closed them out in the final 17 seconds, denying the Clippers 
their fourth win in six tries. 
</P>
<P>
It was their third straight loss by six or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers (14-52) led, 107-105, with 1:55 left on a Charles Smith free 
throw. Threatt's two free throws tied the game with 1:48 remaining, and the 
game was tied again before Ellis' go-ahead basket.

The Clippers outscored the SuperSonics, 12-6, in the final 3 1/2 minutes of the 
third quarter and took a 91-86 lead. White, who came in averaging four points a 
game, scored six in that run and 10 in the period.

Dan Forsman, who has missed the cut in five of his eight tournaments this year, 
fired an opening-round 66 Thursday to take a two-stroke lead over a group of 
six golfers in the $750,000 USF&amp;G tournament at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
In the logjam at four under par were Greg Norman, Tim Simpson, Bill Sander, Tom 
Byrum, Pat McGowan and Lee Chill. 
</P>
<P>
Chill, who has failed seven times to make it through the PGA Tour qualifying 
school, won a spot in a qualifying round Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hallet was alone at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, winner of two consecutive tournaments and the hottest golfer on the 
tour, shot an opening-round 70, putting him in a tie with six other players. 
</P>
<P>
Kite is bidding to become the first golfer since Gary Player in 1978 to win 
three tournaments in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is being played over the 7,106-yard English Turn golf course, 
the first professional event over the links designed by Jack Nicklaus and 
opened to the public last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, playing in the inaugural tournament on his new course, shot a 73. 
</P>
<P>
Allison Finney birdied her first three holes and her final four for a 
seven-under-par 66 and a two-stroke lead over Beth Daniel in the first round of 
the $400,000 LPGA Turquoise tournament at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel birdied five of her last six holes. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Hammel and Joan Pitcock were tied at 69. Jody Rosenthal, Sally Quinlan, 
Carolyn Hill and Jan Stephenson were at 70. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Garbacz, who won her first tournament in 11 years on the LPGA tour last 
week at Tucson, was tied at 71 with five others, including defending champion 
Ok-Hee Ku of South Korea.

UCI'S HOSPITAL HURT BY FUND 'CRISIS,' OFFICIAL WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no diplomas, no paintings, no mementos or miscellaneous clutter to 
testify to Dr. Walter Henry's distinguished career in his new office at the UC 
Irvine College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
There hasn't been time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just finished what I hope will be the most difficult week and a half of 
this job," Henry said, only a little bit facetiously. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, 48, stepped into a storm last week when in his first days as vice 
chancellor of health services and dean of medicine he told the governing UC 
Board of Regents that UCI Medical Center in Orange is on the brink of financial 
collapse. To revive the 493-bed hospital, he said, the medical center might be 
forced to cancel its Medi-Cal contract and halt treatment of the poor except in 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
In his first interview since taking the helm, Henry on Thursday stressed "a 
sense of urgency and a sense of crisis" at the medical center and called on the 
state and county governments to increase reimbursement rates to hospitals that 
treat the poor, the homeless and the chronically ill. To reverse a 
$13.1-million deficit, he said, UCI must dramatically reduce its burden of 
"public" patients, who now make up 65% of all those treated. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get our indigent percentage probably in the 20% range, which is 
where UCLA (Medical Center) is, it's where UC San Francisco is," Henry said. 
"We need to get to that point in order to have the kind of research and 
teaching hospital which is fundamental to our mission as a medical school." 
</P>
<P>
Henry, a member of the UCI faculty since 1978, was president of the medical 
center's staff when Chancellor Jack Peltason asked him to take over after Dr. 
Edward J. Quilligan, former vice chancellor, suddenly resigned last month. 
Henry is regarded as a top heart researcher and an astute administrator, but 
his first and most difficult problem is the one primarily responsible for 
Quilligan's downfall: the ballooning medical center deficit. 
</P>
<P>
UCI officials estimate the hospital will lose $24.3 million in unreimbursed 
care for Medi-Cal clients this year and $11.4 million in expenses for patients 
covered by the county's Indigent Medical Services program. With 6% of the 
county's hospital beds, the university hospital treats 50% of the county's 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is growing -- two of five major hospitals that have contracted to 
provide care for the needy in Orange County terminated their Medi-Cal contracts 
earlier this year, and a third announced plans to drop out of the state program 
in July. The resulting flood of poor patients to UCI is squeezing out privately 
insured patients and is so overloading the hospital that it is forced to 
curtail emergency room admissions and send ambulances elsewhere several times 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
"We must resolve the problems of the UCI Med Center as our first priority," 
Henry said. "I think just for financial reasons we must resolve this problem 
within the next 2 to 3 years. If we do not make changes, the kind of projected 
operating losses that the medical center faces will in the very near future 
become intolerable. . . . It is not the mission of the University of California 
to underwrite indigent care in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "the alarm could have been sounded sooner" and said the 
unraveling of the network of medical care for the poor affects even the 
affluent. 
</P>
<P>
"When hospitals close emergency rooms and go on paramedic bypass, if you happen 
to have an accident on the freeway and are seriously injured, it makes no 
difference whether you can afford to pay or not. You are affected if the 
ambulance that you are in cannot find a nearby emergency room that's open." 
</P>
<P>
UCI officials will bring specific proposals to reduce the medical center's 
indigent load to state and county executives in the next few months, Henry 
said. In the meantime, UCI has requested a 17% increase in its Medi-Cal 
contract. Henry also called on Orange County supervisors to "re-examine their 
priorities and reconsider" the level of county support that he described as one 
of the lowest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in Care 
</P>
<P>
If no accommodation is reached, he said, "indigent patients will be treated on 
an emergency basis, and (indigent) patients who do not constitute an emergency 
will not be admitted." 
</P>
<P>
Daunting as the medical center problems are, Henry said he accepted the vice 
chancellor's post because he believes the university's land, faculty and 
community assets give its medical program potential to become one of the best 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The prospect of helping to implement a vision is something that I find very 
exciting," he said. "I believe I can help guide the faculty through what is 
admittedly a difficult period and I am doing that because I have considerable 
optimism that we can solve these problems and get on with the much more 
exciting aspect of this job, to develop this outstanding health science 
complex." 
</P>
<P>
Henry said he has begun work on a strategic -- and certainly controversial -- 
plan that will chart the course of the medical school for the next 5 to 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Under consideration, he said, is resurrection of plans to build a campus 
hospital, a proposal that was officially abandoned in 1985, when the UC Regents 
bowed to fierce community opposition. Then-medical school Dean Stanley van den 
Noort refused to drop his campaign for the campus hospital, a stand that led to 
his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said that he has not "prejudged" the issue but added that the current 
separation of medical operations at the hospital and science and biology 
departments on the Irvine campus grows increasingly unmanageable as freeways 
linking the two sites grow more congested. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the solutions could be development of an on-campus clinical facility of 
some sort," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
Also up for review is a faculty policy that allows UCI doctors to admit their 
private patients -- those most likely to have insurance -- to other area 
hospitals. No other UC hospital allows its faculty this option. For now, Henry 
said, faculty admitting restrictions would not work at UCI because there is no 
room for additional private patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faculty Support 
</P>
<P>
"We will look at our affiliations with other hospitals as part of the strategic 
planning process. But my personal opinion is that as we reverse the trend of 
increasing numbers of indigent patients and free up beds, I am absolutely 
confident that the faculty will be supportive of the medical center." 
</P>
<P>
The response is an example of Henry's studied and open management style. He is 
a consensus builder, and this strength made him the choice of the usually 
fractious medical faculty when Peltason sought recommendations for a dean last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said he plans to continue to see a small number of private patients and 
will remain active in the American College of Cardiology. His plate is full, he 
agreed, but he said he is encouraged by the positive feedback that he has 
received during a turbulent first 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Henry said, he will get around to hanging a few paintings in his bare 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"Things certainly aren't boring here," he said.

HOT LINE BRINGS TIPS IN KILLING OF SCHOOLCHILD;

<P>
'QUITE A FEW CALLS' TO POLICE REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The search for the killer of 9-year-old Nadia Puente continued Thursday, with 
Santa Ana police sifting through a combination of physical evidence and new 
information supplied through a police hot line. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received quite a few calls on the hot line overnight," said police 
spokeswoman Maureen Thomas, who declined to elaborate about the new 
information. But she said that tips on the girl's kidnaping as she walked home 
from Diamond Elementary School on Monday were being studied by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-grader's body was found early Tuesday morning stuffed in a trash bin 
near Griffith Park Observatory in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the investigation, Thomas said, involves physical evidence, but she did 
not disclose whether it was found where Nadia was abducted or in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't comment. . . . There is physical evidence that does exist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry at Authorities 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the girl's parents expressed "frustration and outrage" toward 
authorities a day after police told them that they had arrested a suspect based 
on strong evidence, then released him hours later. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of like one minute police were telling the mother, 'He's our man.' 
And they (the parents) were put under the impression that police had very 
strong evidence. Then the next minute, they let him go," said Stella Avina of 
the Adam Walsh Center, which has been speaking on behalf of the Puente family. 
</P>
<P>
Avina said the girl's mother is being sedated and the entire family is 
suffering "a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest questions they keep asking themselves is: 'Why?' Why their 
beautiful daughter?" Avina said. 
</P>
<P>
The Puente family had to brace itself for another emotional jolt on Thursday, 
Avina said. The family's youngest boy, 2-year-old Gustavo, underwent surgery to 
remove a tube from his chest that was put there in an earlier bone-marrow 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"You can understand that this is an upsetting time for them," she added. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Thomas said, police met with members of the Puente 
family and briefed them on the investigation. The parents declined to comment 
Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
There has been an outpouring of concern for the girl's family, and an anonymous 
donor has given them $2,900 to cover Nadia's funeral expenses, according to 
Diane Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Thomas, calling the public support "phenomenal," said a Riverside woman 
drove to Diamond school to donate $300 to the Puente family. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the same woman went to a local market, bought groceries for the entire 
family and left them at the school," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Castruita, superintendent of the Santa Ana district, said that school 
officials are trying to gain approval for Nadia's paternal grandfather to enter 
the United States from Mexico to attend next week's funeral. So far, he said, 
they have been unable to arrange it. 
</P>
<P>
A rosary will be said for Nadia by Father Jaime Soto, vicar for the Catholic 
Hispanic Ministries, at 7 p.m. Tuesday at MacDougall Family Mortuary at 1610 E. 
1st St. in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
A Mass will be celebrated at 10 a.m. Wednesday at Our Lady of Guadalupe 
(Delhi), 541 E. Central Ave. in Santa Ana. Interment will follow at Holy 
Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday in Santa Ana, Adam Walsh Center spokesmen called 
for special legislation to protect children, suggesting mandatory 
safety-education programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get away from the idea of the man in the raincoat," said Lynn Day, 
another Adam Walsh spokeswoman. "They (abductors) come in suits and ties." 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Richardson, president of the Santa Ana Unified School District Board 
of Trustees, said he is certain that the district intends to take another look 
at its safety program, especially on advising children to say no to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's role-playing, or bringing police into the classroom, or perhaps a 
combination, saying no is a message that needs to be repeated even to the point 
of redundancy," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, police said, the abductor may have told Nadia that 
he was a teacher who needed help in carrying some books when he lured her 
inside his vehicle, described as a small silver car with black stripes on the 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
Police initially issued a description of the suspect, calling him a Latino man 
with short, dark, curly hair and a goatee. A subsequent composite drawing of 
the suspect depicted a clean-shaven man with straight hair and bangs. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Gonzales, 27, of Garden Grove, who was arrested by police 
Wednesday as a "prime suspect," later was released after eyewitnesses failed to 
positively identify him in a police lineup and his alibi was corroborated. 
</P>
<P>
But police, offering little explanation Thursday, refused to clear Gonzales as 
a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying he's not a primary suspect," Maureen Thomas said, refusing 
further comment on the ground of jeopardizing the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The car Gonzalez had been driving, a small, gray two-door Pontiac, was 
impounded, inspected and then released to him with little explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ruling out any vehicle, including his," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales could not be reached for comment. But a roommate who asked not to be 
identified said that Gonzalez went to work Thursday at a Costa Mesa restaurant, 
returned briefly to their Garden Grove apartment, then left for an undisclosed 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Lt. Bruce Carlson said late Thursday that there were no new 
developments in the investigation of the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson and another of the department's community relations officers, Jose 
Vargas, met with about 30 parents and their children at Diamond school Thursday 
evening in an effort to allay concerns in the wake of Nadia's death, a school 
district spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Thomas said that psychologists who have been available at the school 
since Tuesday night met with 270 parents Wednesday to counsel them about the 
signs that would indicate their children's unspoken fears and anxieties. She 
said they counseled another 30 parents during the day Thursday, some of whom 
were returning for additional help.

400 MOURN VICTIMS OF KOREAN COPTER CRASH 
</P>

The "Home of the Fighting 5th Marines" was silent Thursday morning as more than 
400 Marines and family members gathered at a memorial service at Camp Pendleton 
for the 19 men killed Monday morning in a helicopter crash in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Current and former members of C Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 
friends and relatives, and Marines who just came out of respect, filled the old 
base amphitheater and spilled out onto a gravel road at Camp Margarita, a 
section of the base where 15 of the Marines lived. The other four were based in 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us remember and refocus on the lives of these young soldiers. . . . To 
render and give our honest and unashamed grief and respect that these our 
fallen dead deserve," Lt. Cmdr. Felix Namocatcat said during the the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials are still investigating why the CH-53D Sea Stallion 
helicopter crashed into a dry riverbed near P'ohang on South Korea's eastern 
coast during military exercises with 34 Marines aboard. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the dead, 15 men were injured in the crash. Thursday evening, 13 
of them arrived at the Brooks Memorial Hospital burn center in San Antonio, 
Tex. Another victim, Lance Cpl. Ismael S. Gomez of Santa Ana, is expected to 
return to an Orange County hospital Saturday, officials said. The 15th man, 
whose name was not released, is being kept in South Korea temporarily for 
treatment of head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
All of the Camp Pendleton Marines aboard the downed helicopter were from the 
1st Battalion. That unit, more than 800 strong, left Camp Pendleton last month 
for a 6-month deployment in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Diego County Marine base Thursday, a 21-gun salute and taps ended 
the 35-minute service of prayers, songs and remembrances. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Marines) are in an inherently dangerous profession, and Charlie Company, 
by virtue of the things they had done in the past year and a half, had lived on 
the edge. And the culmination was the disaster in South Korea," Col. Richard 
Rothwell said after the service. 
</P>
<P>
"We do these things not as a monolithic group, but we do these things as a 
family," he said. "Our family is not the same as others -- we're not connected 
by genes or race -- but it's the profession of arms and the commitment to 
preserve our country. And our family is what brings us to these dangers; it is 
also what sustains us when these disasters take place." 
</P>
<P>
Rothwell, commanding officer of the 5th Marine Regiment, said it was one of the 
most decorated teams in the Marine Corps, dating back to World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Jorge Verdugo was a member of that regiment and was well remembered 
by fellow Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to Okinawa together in '87, and we went to the gulf together," said 
Cpl. Ted Thompson after he knelt before a wreath of white and red carnations 
and wept. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a Marine, but he was also a good friend who I could share problems with 
and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
After the service, about 100 Marines lined up to kneel before a rifle and a 
Marine helmet, a temporary memorial for the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Webb, 17, of Encinitas also used the memorial as her way of convincing 
herself that her boyfriend, Lance Cpl. Ronald A. Johnson, 21, of Simi Valley, 
was really gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to admit it at first but knew I had to when they read his name 
from the program," she said. "He was getting out in a few months and was 
looking forward to spending more time with his younger sisters and his mother. 
He had lots of dreams and goals for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have to go (on the trip). He signed up to go. It wasn't a 
requirement. It was just an unfortunate thing."

CHILD PLAYING WITH LIGHTER BLAMED FOR FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire believed to have been started by a child playing with a cigarette 
lighter caused $35,000 damage to a Fullerton apartment and its contents 
Thursday, but a woman and three children escaped unhurt, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The occupant of the apartment, Marie Quinones, and three children were home 
when the fire broke out at about noon in a second-floor unit of a two-story 
apartment complex in the 2300 block of East Commonwealth Avenue, Fullerton Fire 
Department spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause of the fire appears to be the 8-year-old daughter playing with a 
cigarette lighter in one of the two bedrooms," Palmer said. "They all got out 
on their own, uninjured." 
</P>
<P>
There was "very minor damage, less than $500," to a downstairs apartment, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether all three children belonged to Quinones.

GATES LAUDS DISMISSAL OF EX-REPORTER'S SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates said Thursday that he was "especially pleased" for 
his deputies and Santa Ana police officers after a federal judge dismissed an 
$11-million lawsuit brought by a former Orange County Register reporter who 
claimed that he was illegally investigated for writing stories critical of the 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Kelleher ruled in Los Angeles that 
former reporter Charles (Chuck) Cook waited too long to sue Gates over 
incidents allegedly occurring between 1983 and 1985. Gates, the county and city 
of Santa Ana were defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, now editor of the Daily Signal in Santa Clarita, said he will appeal the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"The frivolous nature of Cook's claims indicate the political nature of this 
suit on Cook's part," Gates said. "This decision should be a message to Cook 
and to others who bring lawsuits to achieve their political agenda to quit 
wasting the courts' time and the taxpayers' money to pursue their political 
objectives." 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't like the way I run the Sheriff's Department, they should file as 
a candidate and run against me and let the voters decide," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
In his lawsuit, Cook alleged that Gates and others conspired against him 
because he had written articles critical of deaths in Orange County Jail and 
other issues involving the Sheriff's Department. Cook claimed that Gates 
threatened, harassed and attempted to discredit him to get him fired from the 
Register. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said he did not learn that he had been the target of Gates' investigation 
until February, 1987, when documents were produced in another federal lawsuit. 
That lawsuit was brought against the sheriff and the county by former Municipal 
Judge Bobby D. Youngblood. Youngblood also alleged that he had been the target 
of harassment because of opposition to the sheriff's policies. 
</P>
<P>
The county settled the Youngblood suit out of court, paying $375,000 to 
Youngblood and other plaintiffs without admitting that Gates had done anything 
wrong.

DUMPING PLAN SOUGHT FOR HOUSEHOLD WASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To discourage illegal dumping of household hazardous wastes, county health 
officials are proposing the creation of two special collection stations at 
existing landfills and working with four private stations elsewhere in the 
county to handle such materials. 
</P>
<P>
Operating the pilot program would cost about $1.2 million a year. To pay for 
it, county officials have proposed a 25-cent a ton surcharge on trash deposited 
at county landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is part of a series of changes in landfill fees recommended by 
county health and waste management experts. Under the plan, the basic landfill 
rate on July 1 would jump from the current fee of $11 per ton to $13.75 per 
ton, which includes the surcharge. Fees for individual trucks using the 
landfills would increase from $4 to $5 a load, but the rate for individual cars 
would remain at $3 per load. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposal 
at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fee increases are being proposed to offset the costs of the planned 
closings of the Coyote Canyon landfill south of Irvine and the Santiago Canyon 
landfill east of Orange later this year, and the simultaneous opening of the 
Bee Canyon Landfill northeast of Irvine, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Complying with more stringent environmental regulations for disposing and 
handling trash also has proved more costly for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The special collection stations for household hazardous wastes would be created 
at existing landfills in Brea and San Juan Capistrano. The county also would 
work with private facilities in Anaheim, Stanton, Huntington Beach and Irvine.

JURY BEGINS DELIBERATING SLAYING CASE; 
</P>
<P>
MUST DECIDE WHETHER DEATH WAS MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A powder keg waiting to explode." That's how Gerald Lee Bishop Sr. remembers 
his son's volatile, on-again, off-again relationship with longtime girlfriend 
Marina Garcia of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship turned deadly on June 3, 1988, according to prosecutors, when 
the 22-year-old Gerald Bishop of Westminster strangled and drowned Garcia, then 
buried her body in the desert near Victorville and went back later to dig a 
deeper hole. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is up to a jury to decide what was in Bishop's mind at the time of the 
killing. Jurors began their deliberations in the case in Orange County Superior 
Court on Thursday after attorneys presented their closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors will have to determine whether Bishop killed his longtime girlfriend in 
a fit of rage over her desire to end the relationship and thus, as his attorney 
says, should be convicted of manslaughter; or whether, as prosecutors maintain, 
Bishop acted deliberately to commit an act of murder. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction could mean the difference between Bishop spending the rest of 
his life in prison -- the upper term if he is convicted of first-degree murder 
-- or serving an 11-year maximum prison sentence for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"There was clearly premeditation in this killing, and we want to see him held 
accountable for it," Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard F. Toohey, the prosecutor in 
the case, insisted in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
That was the line of argument that Toohey stressed Thursday morning as he 
presented his closing argument in a Santa Ana courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"There was absolutely nothing sudden" about the killing, Toohey told jurors. 
"There's no question that this was an intentional act." 
</P>
<P>
And the evidence of that, he said, is "overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
The day before Bishop strangled and drowned the 23-year-old Garcia in the 
bathtub of her Huntington Beach home, the prosecutor said, Bishop had indicated 
to a friend his plans to kill his estranged girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
And once the act was done, Toohey said, Bishop tried to cover it up by cleaning 
up her residence, then taking the body out to the desert outside Victorville 
and burying it. 
</P>
<P>
He later returned with his brother to dig a deeper hole, fearful that the body 
might be vulnerable to coyotes or discovered by passers-by, the prosecutor 
said. And he then tried to get rid of Garcia's car by giving it to a hitchhiker 
who apparently did not know how to drive and got in an accident near Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Once arrested, Bishop told police that he did not know Garcia's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
That version of the events surrounding the killing remains essentially 
unchallenged by defense attorney David Biggs, who declined to have Bishop take 
the stand to testify in his own defense during a trial that began last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Heat of Passion' 
</P>
<P>
Biggs, seeking a manslaughter conviction for his client, told the jury that 
Bishop killed Garcia in "the heat of passion" and that her death was the result 
of "an emotionally straining relationship" which erupted into a sudden, vicious 
quarrel between the pair. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, who has graduated from high school but had learning difficulties, had 
no intention of killing Garcia that day, his attorney argued. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Bishop Sr. does not believe his son is a murderer, either. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an extremely volatile relationship -- two kids chasing each other 
and fighting for the better part of 5 years," the elder Bishop said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody was going to get seriously hurt, and it just happens that she was the 
one. I think he was caught up in a set of circumstances that allowed this to 
happen -- but not deliberately," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
"And the irony of the whole thing is that he still loves her. He tells me that 
all the time."

inning, Golden West's Craig Paquette doubled home a run with two outs. Dan 
Villegas then doubled home Paquette to pull the Rustlers (12-7) to within one, 
9-8. However, with the tying run on second, Josh Bammer grounded out to end the 
game.

Sixteen of the nation's best college softball teams have converged at Cal State 
Fullerton this week for the opportunity to gain respect and, perhaps, rise in 
the national rankings with a good showing in the Pony tournament. 
</P>
<P>
For 29 players, it's also a chance to again play in Orange County, where they 
played their high school softball. Kelly Davidson, a sophomore out of Fountain 
Valley High School, traveled the farthest of the 29, arriving with 
Northwestern's team from Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
There's also Terry Carpenter, who returns with Fresno State; Nicky Luce, who 
pitches just up the freeway at Cal Poly Pomona; and Michele Granger, whose 
swollen pitching hand has limited her to four games with California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to be home," said Carpenter, who struck out 411 and walked 10 at 
Edison last year. The right-hander has a streak of 36 consecutive scoreless 
innings for top-ranked Fresno State, including a two-hit shutout against 
Bowling Green Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Every team out here has someone I know from summer ball or from Orange 
County," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the 16 teams competing in the tournament have at least one Orange 
County player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great crop of talent in Orange County," Fullerton Coach Judi Garman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of coaches get a good chance to see the Orange County talent at the Titan 
Softball Complex, where many high school teams play in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to tell (the coaches) not to come, but they come anyway," said Garman, 
whose Titans are ranked fifth in the nation. "We get our share, but there's not 
enough room for one school to recruit all the best. This is the place to come 
and recruit, though." 
</P>
<P>
That has been magnified the past two years, when some of the best players in 
the country have come out of Orange County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The freshmen are coming in and doing a great job," Garman said. "Like one of 
our seniors said, 'I'm glad I'm a senior, because these freshmen and sophomores 
are so good that they'll beat me out for my spot.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of the 29 Orange County players, 16 are freshmen and sophomores. They include: 
Deanna Mays of Nebraska, who helped Kennedy to the 3-A title last year as a 
first baseman; Michelle Shean, a utility player at Oklahoma State who last year 
was an infielder at San Clemente; Gina LoPiccolo, a sophomore hitting .282 for 
Fresno State, who started at third base four years at Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the nation's top seven teams and nine of the top 20 are competing in 
the tournament, which began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
After three days of pool play, the teams break into brackets Saturday and play 
until the championship game Sunday at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County players in the tournament, their hometowns and schools are: 
Julie Standering (Anaheim) Arizona, Denise Correa (Cypress) Cal Poly Pomona, 
Lori Thompson (Anaheim) Pomona, Carey Hess (Anaheim) Cal State Fullerton, Jill 
Matyuch (Placentia) Fullerton; Tiny Glomboske (Placentia) Fullerton, Mich 
Debree (La Habra) Fullerton, Nikkie Lewis (Anaheim) Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the tournament are Martha Noffsinger (Huntington Beach) Fresno State, 
Marian Mendoza (Garden Grove) Cal State Long Beach, Ruby Flores (Buena Park) 
Long Beach; Annette Gonzales (La Habra) Long Beach, Kellie Kane (Costa Mesa) 
Long Beach, Lisa Pederson (Cypress) Long Beach, Janelle Frese (La Palma) 
Nebraska, Cindy Michik (Fullerton) New Mexico State, Cindy Gossmer (Anaheim) 
U.S. International University, Nora Flores (Buena Park) USIU, Shannon Riley 
(Cypress) USIU, Kelli Thomas (Laguna Niguel) USIU, Amy Geldbach (Los Alamitos) 
USIU, Kelly Winkler (Huntington Beach) USIU.

GRANGER ITCHING TO RETURN TO PITCHING FOR CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every pitch makes her eager, every out haunts her desire to play, every inning 
simply frustrates her. Michele Granger is suffering from softball withdrawal, 
and tossing the habit has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
Granger, the heralded Valencia High School pitcher who has returned to Orange 
County this week, is bothered by a swelling in her pitching hand. Her team, the 
14th-ranked California Golden Bears, are competing in the Pony tournament at 
Cal State Fullerton, but Granger will be doing what she's done best for the 
past month -- watch and cheer from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
It has been nine years since she started competing in softball, and being 
forced into a spectator's role only makes her hurt more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really frustrating," Granger said, while her teammates warmed up Thursday 
for a game against Northwestern. "It's been somewhat boring since I've been 
hurt. I basically just sit and watch while they ice my hand. I'd much rather be 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
What's worse, no one knows exactly what's wrong with her left hand and no one 
can say when she will play again. When Granger throws, the swelling starts. 
When she's done, her fingers look like sausages. 
</P>
<P>
"They still don't know what's wrong," she said. "They (team physicians) have 
been doing rehabilitation on my arm to keep it in shape." 
</P>
<P>
The swelling began bothering her earlier this season, but the freshman managed 
a 2-2 record in four games, striking out 37 with an 0.56 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
At Valencia, she set a number of national high school records, including career 
strikeouts (1,635), career no-hitters (36) and career perfect games (nine). She 
also helped lead the United States to the 1986 Women's World Championship and 
helped her U.S. team to the gold medal in the 1987 Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
All those pitches in all those seasons took their toll on her arm. Although the 
doctors don't think that's the problem, Granger says it might have something to 
do with it. "That's my opinion at least," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a very easy year last year -- easy in that I didn't pitch a lot of 
warm-ups or practices -- but I was throwing a lot again this year," she said. 
"I think it was my fault. If you are throwing on an injury, it's going to get 
worse. I ignored it for a while and kept pitching." 
</P>
<P>
The pain won't leave her alone now. She can't wait for the day when the 
swelling subsides and the competition resumes. "The season's almost half over," 
Granger said. "I just hope it's not too distant."

Permits for construction of single-family homes in Orange County fell through 
the floor in January, the Construction Industry Research Board reported. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments issued permits for 480 houses during the month, down 29% from 
a year ago when 670 permits were issued. Across the state, permits for houses 
rose 14% from a year ago, the research board reported recently. 
</P>
<P>
Permits for multifamily units -- apartments and condominiums -- didn't fall 
nearly as far as houses in Orange County. That's partly because multifamily 
construction has already dropped in Orange County and around the country due to 
changes in the federal tax laws that eliminated tax benefits for building 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, construction of multifamily units was off nearly 23% 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, permits for all types of residential units in the county fell 21% 
in January from a year ago.

VENEZUELA CURRENCY DEVALUATION SENDS SHOCK WAVES THROUGH ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Financial Times

<DATELINE>
<P>
CARACAS, Venezuela 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sharp devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar decreed last week by the 
government of President Carlos Andres Perez is sending shock waves through the 
economy, which relies heavily on imports. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for many goods and services are rising steeply, and the economy will 
most likely suffer a substantial contraction this year, after registering a 
4.2% increase in gross domestic product in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Most car assembly plants have closed down temporarily and many other companies 
have curtailed operations until they work out plans for coping with the new 
situation, especially in terms of financing imports and servicing foreign debt 
under the new foreign exchange system. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies will be forced into severe financial straits, or even 
bankruptcy, by the new exchange policy, which has almost doubled the 
local-currency cost of imports. 
</P>
<P>
The government, concerned at the dismissal of an estimated 10,000 private 
sector workers in recent weeks, with the prospect of more to come, ordered a 
120-day freeze on dismissals only 1 day after the devaluation took effect. This 
and other recent social welfare moves may mean the government is not willing to 
permit a socially and politically painful restructuring of the Venezuelan 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The recent devaluation is part of a general economic program announced by the 
government on Feb. 16 that includes removing most controls on prices and 
domestic interest rates, reducing tariffs attempting to lower the government's 
fiscal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The new exchange policy eliminates a dual-rate structure under which Venezuela 
had an official exchange rate of 14.5 bolivars per U.S. dollar and a free 
market rate. It establishes a system whereby a single, floating rate is set 
during daily free-market trading at commercial banks and exchange houses. 
</P>
<P>
Although the government has not made the situation entirely clear, it appears 
that the floating rate will apply to all but a handful of international 
financial transactions. This means that it will cover all imports, public- and 
private-sector foreign debt of $33 billion and a big share of $6 billion in 
outstanding letters of credit owed by Venezuelan importers. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the expectations of many, the bolivar has strengthened since the 
devaluation was decreed last week, moving from just over 40 per dollar to 36.3 
at close of trading on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The old official rate was used for most of the country's international 
transactions, including imports (around $11 billion last year) and foreign debt 
repayments. The impact of eliminating this rate is great, since the country 
must import most of the raw materials and components used by industry, as well 
as around half of its foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a devaluation penalizes importers financially while it rewards 
exporters, and in Venezuela the government is by far the top exporter. In 1987, 
for example, private-sector exports were only 5.4% of the country's total 
exports of $10.6 billion, while private companies accounted for 77% of total 
imports of $8.8 billion. The situation was not much different last year. 
</P>
<P>
The new exchange rate system should spur investment in non-petroleum exports, 
but the process of converting Venezuelan industries into exporters on a 
substantial scale could take 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Before most private companies even consider the possibility of making new 
investments for export business, they must grapple with a variety of serious 
problems directly related to the devaluation, such as outstanding foreign debt, 
letters of credit and a domestic market reacting to sharply higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Repayment of over $6 billion in letters of credit, for example, presents a 
dilemma above and beyond other existing obligations to foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
Until the March 14 devaluation, the government had guaranteed foreign exchange 
to private companies at the official exchange rate of 14.5 bolivars per dollar 
to settle letters of credit. Now, however, under a new government scheme, only 
a portion of outstanding letters will receive foreign currency at the old rate. 
</P>
<P>
The president of a big vehicle assembly plant said privately that the industry 
had about $700 million in outstanding letters and that the government plan 
meant they would get around 40 cents on the dollar. Losses for this sector 
alone, a major employer, will be huge, and some foreign companies may be forced 
to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
As the effects of this devaluation begin to be felt, business analysts in 
Caracas are concerned about two other key factors. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's devaluation is part of an economic adjustment plan, worked out by 
the government and the International Monetary Fund, meant to let Venezuela 
develop a more competitive economy with reduced government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
But the government, traumatized by riots 3 weeks ago and worried that higher 
prices and joblessness could provoke another social explosion, is maintaining 
some of its paternalistic tendencies. It is trying to cushion the effects of 
the program for workers by establishing obligatory private-sector wage 
increases and by offering a range of costly new social welfare benefits. In 
addition to several socially minded measures already announced, the 
administration is rumored to be contemplating a job-creation program to keep 
unemployment down in a country where it has been traditionally low. 
</P>
<P>
But the economy will hardly become more competitive if widespread bankruptcies 
occur over the next 2 to 3 years, and the only private companies rich enough to 
pick up the pieces are the existing oligopolies that already control big 
sectors of Venezuelan industry and commerce.

MENDELSSOHN STRING QUARTET PLAYS HAYDN, SHOSTAKOVICH, DVORAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sunny extroversion of Haydn and the knotty, shifting moods of Shostakovich 
evoked sympathetic responses from the New York-based Mendelssohn String Quartet 
at Laguna Beach High School on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the lush Romanticism of Dvorak remained a closed book. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps part of the problem is that over the past 3 years, the youthful quartet 
-- which was formed only a decade ago -- has lost its original first violinist 
and violist, a major disruption in such a group. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the picture in the program provided by the Laguna Beach Chamber Music 
Society did not represent the quartet that actually played as part of the 
society's series. 
</P>
<P>
Violist Ira Weller, who is seen in the picture, has been replaced by Kathryn 
Murdock (who appeared with the quartet when it played a similar concert in Los 
Angeles about 3 months ago). 
</P>
<P>
First violinist Ida Levin joined the group in 1987. Only violinist Nicholas 
Mann and cellist Marcy Rosen remain from the original quartet, which was one of 
the winners in the 1981 Young Concert Artists' International Auditions. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently there has not been enough time to combine focus with depth and 
variety. (Or even, evidently, to pose for a new photo.) On Wednesday, the 
music-making occasionally was tentative and over-dominated by Levin. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in Haydn's Quartet in C, Opus 20, No. 2, the players maintained light, 
buoyant and bright textures, skittering nimbly through the final four-part 
fugue as if it was an elfin scherzo composed by the quartet's namesake. 
</P>
<P>
In Shostakovich's Ninth Quartet, the players imparted vigor and clarity to the 
composer's tense, impacted rhythms and his kaleidoscopic textures and 
ruminations. 
</P>
<P>
If they failed to make the work a strongly personal document, their formal 
approach was workable. 
</P>
<P>
Not so in Dvorak's Quartet in A-flat, Opus 105, where the ensemble's patrician 
clarity and balance, restraint in vibrato and lack of full-bodied utterances 
all suggested a deliberate -- but wrong-headed -- purgation of the composer's 
19th-Century rhetoric or, worse, perhaps even ignorance of appropriate style. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Levin could be edgy, forced and aggressive in tone, particularly 
under pressure, while Mann and the others remained steadfastly self-effacing. 
</P>
<P>
All that remained of the composer's wondrous music was its structural outlines, 
hardly a fair trade for the missing expressivity.

BURDON: LOT OF VOICE, BUT A LITTLE RESPECT, PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, the good news about Eric Burdon's performance Wednesday at the Coach 
House: The 47-year-old British singer is not an oldies automaton, cranking out 
a rote greatest-hits set. And time hasn't diminished the force and violence of 
his voice, which came as a revelation amid the '60s British invasion, when his 
Animals offered a tough, blues-based, street-knowing alternative to Herman's 
Hermits. 
</P>
<P>
Expecting some bad news now? Burdon's 15-song set at the San Juan Capistrano 
club provided an ample supply. That great voice was squandered on both faceless 
new material and careless remakes from his catalogue. Nearly every Animals' 
classic in the set was extensively reworked by Burdon and his four-piece band, 
but rather than recasting the songs into something still emotionally viable, 
Burdon seemed intent on negating their power. 
</P>
<P>
The uptempo arrangements of "It's My Life" and "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" 
may have been chosen simply to allow Burdon to get them over with sooner. On 
the latter song, Burdon tossed out most of the original lyrics and melody, 
offering rambling cliches and snatches of "On Broadway" in their place. 
</P>
<P>
At nearly every turn, the singer seemed intent on distancing himself from his 
Animals' material, even screaming "I hate this song!" repeatedly before 
performing a largely overblown encore of "House of the Rising Sun." The title 
of Burdon's autobiography is "I Used to Be an Animal, but I'm Alright Now," and 
indeed, one got the feeling that Burdon judges his music on how far removed it 
is from his past, rather than on where it might be headed now. It's an 
understandable quandary: What self-respecting person wants to enter his 50s 
still repeating the job he had in his teens? 
</P>
<P>
But self-respect, or respect of any manner, might have been the chief thing 
lacking from Wednesday's show. One need only hear Bruce Springsteen's chilling 
live version of "It's My Life" or Elvis Costello's passionate cover of "Don't 
Let Me Be Misunderstood" to know that there are new, powerful, immediate 
interpretations still to be found in the song. 
</P>
<P>
And here was Burdon -- still possessed of the voice that first allowed those 
singers, and the rest of their generation, to find meaning in those songs -- 
treating them like a last-minute homework assignment. 
</P>
<P>
That loss wouldn't be nearly so dire were Burdon's current material worth his 
voice. Instead, the songs, drawn chiefly from 1988's "I Used to Be an Animal" 
album, served only to remind that most of Burdon's greatest moments started 
with someone else's pen. For every "When I Was Young" or "Sky Pilot" that 
Burdon did create, there were innumerable "Year of the Gurus" and "Black 
Plagues" best consigned to the patchouli patch, and his current songs are 
kindred to those, composed of overused riffs, negligible melodies and 
declamatory froth. 
</P>
<P>
Burdon seems also to have lost touch with the blues and R&amp;B music which 
once inspired him. A tribute to blues slide-guitar master Elmore James, "No 
More Elmore," was more than devoid of both the spirit and feel of James' 
floor-shaking music, offering instead a mighty white excess of screeching, 
interminable virtuosity from all corners of the stage. If James weren't already 
dead, hearing this could certainly have hastened his demise. Similarly the 
closing encore of Lloyd Price's "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" sounded as if it had been 
birthed in Ritchie Blackmore's trousers rather than New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
There were some, though far too few, saving moments to the performance. The 
bluesy ballad "Going Back to Memphis" gave his voice something worth digging 
into, supported by a spoken middle where he recalled the dichotomy of being in 
Memphis in 1966, seeing the "New South" in the person of Otis Redding, and that 
same day witnessing a Klan-cross burning. "Believe me, it was nothing like 
Madonna's new video," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And despite his disclaimer preceding "House of the Rising Sun," Burdon's 
singing sometimes struck with the foundation-rending passion he had found for 
the song a quarter-century ago. It's a shame that he didn't more often use that 
legacy as something to build on, rather than escape.

AIDS THEME DARKENS ARTIST'S PLAYFUL VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE MCKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Masami Teraoka has always taken a tolerant view of the folly of humankind. A 
social critic in the tradition of Daumier and Thomas Nast, he's explored man's 
ignorance and short-sightedness with the wise bemusement of an indulgent 
parent. Frantically racing about, soiling his own nest, a slave to sensual 
pleasure, blind to the glory of nature, man is obviously a rather foolish 
creature, but like a mischievous dog that persists in chewing up the paper, you 
love him anyway. Teraoka affects a sharp shift in tone in his latest series, 
however. A mournful requiem for AIDS and a warning of even darker days to come, 
"Waves and Plagues" speaks with a grave sense of finality altogether absent in 
previous work by this enormously popular artist. 
</P>
<P>
On view at the Long Beach Museum of Art through April 25, "Waves and Plagues" 
may be a bit too heavy for Teraoka's longtime fans who have loved his work for 
its playful handling of erotica (one of the cornerstones of Japanese art) and 
the comical collision of the cultures of Japan and America. A master of the 
visual pun, Teraoka has explored pollution and the corruption of tradition as 
symbolized by such things as the junk food industry and the tourist trade, and 
invariably made his point with an extremely light touch. If you failed to get 
the message or the jokes in his delightfully naughty paintings, you could 
always luxuriate in their overripe beauty or marvel at Teraoka's dazzling 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, virtually impossible to miss the point in this new work; these 
pictures resonate with an overwhelming sadness that's both moving and 
unmistakably grim. "Waves and Plagues" is but the latest in a spate of 
exhibitions designed to increase public awareness of the AIDS epidemic, and the 
recent death of esteemed photographer Robert Mapplethorpe will no doubt 
generate a few more. (LACE presented a survey of AIDS-related art last fall, 
and a similar exhibition of photographs by Rosalind Solomon opens at UC San 
Diego on Tuesday). Born in Japan in 1936, Teraoka immigrated to the United 
States in 1961 and became caught up in the then-burgeoning Pop art movement. 
Synthesizing the disparate influences of Japan, America and Pop, he arrived at 
a unique style rooted in the traditional Japanese printmaking form known as 
Ukiyo-e. A vibrant yet meticulously controlled woodblock-print technique, 
Ukiyo-e became popular in Japan in 1615 and thrived until 1868 when it 
disappeared. Basically a form of genre art, Ukiyo-e is comparable to modern-day 
comic books in that these images are often inscribed with text illustrating a 
corresponding story. Teraoka revived the style and made it current by using it 
to tell modern stories loaded with hip nuances, and his reputation spread like 
wildfire after his first major one-man show in 1975. (The fact that his work 
reproduces extremely well didn't hurt.) 
</P>
<P>
Teraoka's longtime preoccupation with nature and eros dovetail perfectly in 
AIDS, which he perceives as a metaphor for the wrath of nature and a 
foreshadowing of even greater ecological disasters to come. He delivers his 
warning here in the form of complex parables, many of which employ the 
structure of Kabuki theater. The recurring motifs in these highly detailed 
compositions function on multiple levels; the snake, for instance, symbolizes 
the AIDS virus, while condoms represent salvation and the forethought one must 
now bring to sex. 
</P>
<P>
Tormented, angry figures wear blue makeup which signifies that they've died but 
are unable to rest in peace. "He died but his soul hasn't really passed on yet; 
it wanders around," reads the text on a particularly powerful image. The lush 
beauty of Teraoka's watercolor style juxtaposed with the anguish and confusion 
of the figures in these images makes them doubly heartbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago, Teraoka relocated from Los Angeles to Hawaii, and not 
surprisingly, the shift in locale is reflected in his art. Whereas previously 
his work occasionally verged on being hysterically busy, "Waves and Plagues" 
exudes a quiet, somber simplicity (which could, of course, have something to do 
with the subject matter). Life in a tropical paradise has also increased his 
concern with ecological issues, and he's begun doing straight landscapes, a few 
of which stand among his finest work. "Pali Lookout," a small landscape of a 
bank of green cliffs eroded by the sea, pulsates with a mysterious ambiguity 
that leaves it open to more varied interpretation than his narrative scenes 
allow. 
</P>
<P>
However, the occasional luminous landscape does little to disguise the fact 
that Teraoka is essentially a fin de siecle artist working at the top of his 
form. Fin de siecle is a French term describing the final flowering of a 
culture that's become so perversely overwound and diseased that it's on the 
verge of blowing apart; that's pretty much what "Waves and Plagues" is about.

The buzz: "It's about time." That's what movers and shakers are saying about 
the salute to James Roosevelt planned for May 20 at the Irvine Hilton and 
Towers. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College is planning the gala benefit dinner, which has Sen. Pete Wilson 
heading up an honorary committee that includes former Presidents Richard M. 
Nixon and Gerald R. Ford; Peter Ueberroth; Gov. George Deukmejian; Athalie 
Clarke, and Barbara Grant, widow of actor Cary Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Chairing the dinner committee is Doy Henley, CEO of Aeromil Engineering in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
According to Vaughn W. Kelley, director of community relations and special 
events for Chapman, the college plans to present a Roosevelt Award each year to 
an individual who exhibits the "dedication to higher education and public 
service" that Roosevelt has made his life's work. The award will probably 
include a college scholarship, Kelley says. "Our board is working that out." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the event -- $300,000 is hoped for -- will be used to endow the 
Roosevelt Award program. 
</P>
<P>
More than 800 guests are expected to attend. Tickets are selling for $150 each, 
and tables are being sold in the $1,500 to $10,000 range. Roosevelt, eldest son 
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, is a Chapman College trustee. He lives with his 
wife, Mary, and daughter, Becky, in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For arts' sake: Christopher Kennedy Lawford, son of Pat Kennedy Lawford and the 
late Peter Lawford, is expected to attend a benefit sale of art by the 
handicapped April 1 at Galerie Olivia in Newport Beach. Proceeds will benefit 
Very Special Arts California, an educational affiliate of the John F. Kennedy 
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. VSA, founded by Jean Kennedy 
Smith in 1974, is now an international program; its mission is to help 
individual handicapped people through encouraging them to express themselves 
artistically. On the sponsoring committee with Lawford is Marylyn Pauley, vice 
chairwoman of community relations for the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
The 8-month-old gallery, which specializes in original European oil paintings, 
is owned by George Townsend and Franklyn Richards. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's entertainment: Paul Newman. George Burns. Julie Andrews. Glenn 
Close. Liza Minnelli. Diana Ross. Those are but a few of the few hundred stars 
who lit up Spago last year at super-agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar's post Academy 
Awards smash. Let's face it. There's not another party like it in the universe. 
And only somebodies gain admittance. ("You're somebody if you're there, whether 
you're somebody or not," chirps one giggling insider.) But take heart. Orange 
County will be stunningly represented at the nouvelle-pizza party when Newport 
Beach model Tina Schafnitz makes her entrance with husband Matt, an insurance 
broker. What to wear? Tina knows. A showstopper, of course. But she hasn't 
decided which showstopper. "It will either be my black-and-white by Gildas or 
my charcoal-with-pearls by Bob Mackie," says the statuesque blonde with the 
saucer eyes. We're rooting for Gildas. He's from Orange County too. 
</P>
<P>
Morsels: When charming Fernanda Gilligan, a vice president with Tiffany &amp; 
Co. in New York, attended a recent benefit at Tiffany in Costa Mesa, few guests 
realized that they were hobnobbing with the former stepdaughter of one of New 
York's reigning hobnobbers, supreme socialite Mercedes Kellogg Bass. Gilligan 
-- a bright-eyed fireball whose well-shod feet are planted firmly on the ground

chic Iranian-born Manhattanite who recently wed Sid Bass. While Gilligan was in 
town, she stayed at the Newporter Resort -- "It's so California!" -- and took

Leave it to billionairess Leona Helmsley of New York to wear le dernier cri in 
fashion at the Ritz-Carlton hotel last week when she and hubby Harry's Helmsley 
Palace received the Five Diamond Award from the American Automobile Assn. The 
queenly brunette was all the rage in diamonds and rubies and a cloud of floaty 
chiffon, the gala look that's so in for spring. Helmsley admitted that she had 
never heard of Orange County before she came to Dana Point. But she said she 
had heard of the Amen Wardy boutique in Newport Beach. She spent a day there 
and "bought a bunch," she said. As for O.C., Leona, who has mansions in all the 
right places, pronounced it "beautiful." "I like it. Truthfully, the air is 
clear here. You have the sea." (For trivia lovers: Harry owns the Empire State 
Building, and last year he lit it up for Leona's birthday. But Leona wasn't 
saying which birthday.) . . . .

Birraporetti's in Costa Mesa will be the happening place Tuesday night after 
"Elvis: A Musical Celebration" makes its debut at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center. The 20-member cast -- along with Elvis seem-alikes Johnny Seaton, 
Julian Whittaker and Terry Mike Jeffrey -- will mingle with Center board 
members and enjoy a '50s theme party, complete with 45 r.p.m. records dangling 
from the ceiling. (In a perfect world, the Center board would all show up in 
blue suede shoes.) Be there or be square.

'ONE BIG FAMILY'; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD GATHER TO FURTHER THE CAUSE OF FRIENDSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LYNDA KIM, Lynda Kim is a senior at Cypress High School, where she is the 
editor of the school newspaper, Centurion Scroll, the historian for student 
government, president of the physics and calculus clubs, vice president of the 
International Club and a member of the California Scholastic Federation.

From Japanese kimonos to Pakistani fashions, from Korean barbecues to 
all-American hamburgers, from African, American and Latin rhythms to a Hawaiian 
hula dance . . . the International Days festival at Cypress High School 
celebrated a coming together of nations. 
</P>
<P>
The third annual festival, with "A Little Peace of the World" as its theme, was 
sponsored by Cypress High's International Club. About 30 foreign exchange 
students attending high schools throughout the Southland spent last Friday on 
the Cypress campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the world as one big family. Its members create barriers out of fear and 
ignorance. Understanding and friendship melt the barriers," said Hillary 
Marshall, a 17-year-old senior and president of the Cypress International Club. 
</P>
<P>
"People need to understand one another through knowledge of others' cultures," 
said Marshall, who spent last summer as an exchange student in Argentina. 
"World understanding through knowledge and friendship -- that's what it's all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
International Day's busy schedule included classroom visits by the exchange 
students, a multicultural fashion show, a parade of flags and international 
food booths operated by campus clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think International Day was great," said Pia Hakio, a 17-year-old exchange 
student from Finland who is a junior at Norwalk High. "I met so many exchange 
students from this area. I especially liked the party and the fashion show." 
</P>
<P>
Freddy Graubner, a 17-year-old senior at Lakewood High, is an exchange student 
from West Germany. "I loved it because all the nations came together and we all 
had the same feelings inside," he said. "It was like we're all the same and not 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lasse Makela, a 17-year-old junior from Finland who attends Gahr High in 
Cerritos: "I liked visiting the classes. They treated me really well. They 
wanted to know about my country, they asked questions, and they didn't put us 
(the exchange students) down." 
</P>
<P>
It is through such organizations as AFS International, Youth for Understanding, 
and Europe Foundation that exchange students are paired with their host 
families for a semester, a school year or the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students attending International Day were making their first visit 
to the United States. Their thoughts about this country, its people and 
educational system seemed to differ as much as their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came to California, I wanted to see all the famous places like 
Disneyland and Hollywood," Hakio said. "I liked Disneyland a lot, but Hollywood 
wasn't as glamorous as I thought it would be. I really like to go shopping. 
Also, there are so many channels on TV. In Finland, we only have three 
channels." 
</P>
<P>
Isabelle Boutin, a 17-year-old senior from Canada attending Long Beach Poly 
High, said Southern California was not all she expected. "What I expected was 
warmer weather. I thought I was going (to go) to the beach every day. But the 
weather is cooler, and you have other things to do than just go to the beach -- 
you have to go to school, do homework and stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to live in Southern California (permanently). It's too 
stressful here because there's too much population." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Yaman Atatus, an 18-year-old from Turkey who attends Newport Harbor High, 
said, "I used to watch a lot of American TV programs back home. Shows like 
'Dynasty' give a bad impression of America, but I learned that it's not really 
like that here. 
</P>
<P>
"Our culture is probably moving towards America. We have McDonald's, the beach 
life. . . . You know, we have almost the same life back home. The difference is 
that we kept our tradition. We try not to let go of it. For instance, we 
probably treat old people with more respect in Turkey." 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Englert, a 17-year-old senior from West Germany attending Anaheim High, 
said, "What I hate about America are the families who are total couch potatoes, 
but then you can't really go out in the field and the nature to get fresh air 
if you live in a really big city like Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
Sanne Simonsen, a 17-year-old from Denmark attending Cypress High as a senior, 
said, "I like California sun, the beaches and that most people are pretty 
friendly and open. The best thing is that things are happening all the time 
here. I like that." 
</P>
<P>
"We were warned about the pollution and other problems in California through 
the media back home," she added. "One bad thing (in California) is that you 
have to depend on family and friends to pick you up all the time. But my host 
family and friends are really nice about it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Graubner: "There are so many rules here, especially in school. People 
don't set standards and rules for themselves because there are so many put upon 
them. It's not like that in (West) Germany." She said there are open campuses 
at schools in her homeland, and although the legal drinking age is 18, the law 
is hardly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Turning their thoughts to education, the exchange students unanimously 
preferred their own countries' systems. 
</P>
<P>
Dejan Aleksic, 17, of Yugoslavia, a senior at Newport Harbor High, explained: 
"School is different. In Yugoslavia the students stay in one class all the 
time, and the teachers go around from class to class. Also, we have more 
subjects to learn in one year. I would usually have to take about 13 subjects 
every year." 
</P>
<P>
Said Englert: "I like the sports in American schools, but I like (schools) in 
Germany better because you learn much more. You learn more because the teachers 
really motivate you to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Said Andersen: "It's nice that you get to go around to different classes and 
see different people every period, but on the other hand, you don't know your 
classmates very well. Also, I think the (school) work is a lot easier here 
(than in Denmark)." 
</P>
<P>
Another major difference was pointed out by Simonsen, who said, "We call our 
teachers by their first names. We also have more discussions in class." She 
added, "The (education) system in Denmark is not as stressful as the system in 
America because we do not have as many tests there." 
</P>
<P>
Added Simonsen:"I don't want to stereotype, but most teen-agers in America are 
a little more superficial than teen-agers in Denmark. (American teen-agers) 
care a lot about the way they look. They wear more makeup here. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing is that Denmark teen-agers have more freedom, like staying out 
late. Maybe that's because it's safer in Denmark." 
</P>
<P>
Added Andersen: "I think American kids, when you make friends with them, it's 
not really a close friendship. It's like when you see them, you say, 'What's 
up, dude?' and that's it. Also, you can't say this about everybody, but I think 
teen-agers here are immature." 
</P>
<P>
Englert agreed with Andersen. "I think they (American teen-agers) care too much 
about how they are on the outside. I didn't really find a lot of people I could 
talk to seriously. They just see things on top and not look in deeper." 
</P>
<P>
Added Hakio: "In Finland, parents trust teen-agers more than parents here do. 
Teen-agers are more free there." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would consider making the United States his permanent home, 
Atatus said, "It's nice here, but (Turkey) is also nice. And my country needs 
well-educated people (because) we have problems to solve. Maybe one of the 
people who will solve them is me."

STOPPING SMOKERS BEFORE THEY START

Reasoning that the best way to break the smoking habit is to stop it before it 
begins, sponsors of the successful tobacco tax initiative Proposition 99 said 
they want to focus their anti-smoking education campaign on school-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to teach every child about the hazards of smoking," said Dr. W. James 
Nethery, chairman of Coalition for a Healthy California. He added that "90% of 
all smokers start by the age of 19, and 60% begin by the age of 14." 
</P>
<P>
Key members of the coalition are the American Lung Assn., the American Cancer 
Society, the American Heart Assn., the Planning and Conservation League and the 
California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99 imposed a 15-cent-a-pack tax increase on cigarettes and placed 
comparable tax increases on cigars and other tobacco products. The new taxes 
will raise about $650 million a year, which will go into anti-smoking education 
campaigns, health care, cancer research and enhancement of natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of Proposition 99 said they want legislation that will earmark 70% of 
the money for programs aimed at school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
School districts will be eligible to apply for the Proposition 99 money, but so 
will community clinics, volunteer health agencies, local health departments, 
and hospitals and community clinics.

PROTESTERS BLOCK CLINIC AT LONG BEACH;

<P>
PROTESTERS BLOCKADE L.B. CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH and CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 300 anti-abortion protesters blockaded a Long Beach women's clinic this 
morning, drawing another counter-protest by pro-choice groups and inviting 
arrest for the second day in a row -- but police finally decided not to 
accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
After a five-hour standoff, police announced that there would be no arrests 
because the protesters were cooperating, were moving back from the building and 
apparently planned to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Operation Rescue leaders said they had contingency plans to blockade 
another clinic at an undisclosed location if they were not arrested in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Until the sudden reversal, arrests appeared imminent. By late morning, after 
officers declared that those sitting in front of entrances to a medical 
building at 28th Street and Pacific Avenue were violating the law, only about 
150 of the protesters remained seated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police in Two Rows 
</P>
<P>
Members of Operation Rescue, determined to close Southern California abortion 
clinics with three days of sit-ins, appeared at their target of the day, the 
Women's Care Medical Group Inc., shortly after 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
They immediately drew a contingent of counterdemonstrators from the nearby 
headquarters of the Family Planning Assn. of Long Beach, one of the 
mobilization points for pro-choice forces waiting to see where the 
anti-abortionists planned to strike. 
</P>
<P>
The shouting began as the anti-abortionists sat five deep on three sides of the 
building and pro-choice activists ringed them with "Keep Abortions Legal" 
placards. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of Pacific Avenue, which was closed to traffic, about 60 helmeted 
Long Beach police officers stood in two rows waiting for orders to start making 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 10 a.m. -- although the clinic had yet to open -- Long Beach 
police tried to escort a patient and a receptionist through the blockade. They 
were blocked from entering by the anti-abortionists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Papers Served on Terry 
</P>
<P>
That, police said, meant that the law had been broken. They prepared to begin 
making arrests, allowing all those who did not wish to be arrested to move 
outside a yellow tape. Apparently all the pro-choice people and half of the 
anti-abortion demonstrators moved away from the building. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Terry, the 29-year-old Binghamton, N.Y., founder of Operation Rescue, 
was with his demonstrators and was served papers in connection with a federal 
lawsuit filed three years ago by the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, whose name was added to the suit recently, and three other people are 
charged with racketeering, extortion and stealing fetal parts in connection 
with protests in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 350 Operation Rescue people and one pro-choice demonstrator were 
arrested in Cypress for failing to leave the scene of an unlawful assembly. 
They were cited and released on their own recognizance after being ordered to 
face arraignment in West Orange County Municipal Court in late April.

BIPARTISAN CONTRA AID PLAN UNVEILED BY BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush today unveiled a bipartisan Contra aid plan as the first plank 
of his emerging foreign policy, outlining a $4.5-million-per-month program that 
commits his Administration to support Central American peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement for the first time offers money to the Nicaraguan rebels that can 
be used to resettle in their homeland and rejoin political life there, and 
breaks a long partisan stalemate over U.S. policy toward the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it mean an end to the war? Let's hope so," said Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, a chief architect of the accord. Bush said, "The burden of proof 
is on the Sandinista government to comply" with democratization promises made 
to their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One Voice' 
</P>
<P>
With congressional leaders of both parties at his side, Bush said, "We will be 
speaking with one voice," striking a sharp contrast to what was perhaps the 
most divisive issue of the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for the continuation of non-lethal humanitarian aid 
through February, 1990, the date set for elections in Nicaragua. Baker said it 
would amount to $4.5 million a month for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
"With regard to Nicaragua, the United States is united in its goals: 
democratization, an end to subversion and destabilization of its neighbors, an 
end to Soviet Bloc military ties that threaten U.S. and regional security," the 
agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
It noted that under existing agreements among the five Central American 
countries -- Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala -- 
"insurgent forces are supposed to voluntarily reintegrate into their homeland 
under safe, democratic conditions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relocation Aid 
</P>
<P>
The money provided under the agreement is expected to be approved by Congress 
soon after it returns from its Easter break next month, can be used for 
voluntary relocation aid, the agreement stated. Only the money, not the policy 
statement, needs congressional approval.

ANAHEIM STING OPERATION RECOVERS $1.4 MILLION IN GOODS; 105 CHARGED

<P>
A stolen property sting operation believed to be the largest ever in Orange 
County ended this morning with charges filed against 105 suspects and recovery 
of nearly $1.4 million in items that were allegedly sold to undercover Anaheim 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Chief Joseph Molloy announced at a news conference that about 
half of the suspected thieves had been arrested this morning by eight teams of 
officers in Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. Anaheim Police Lt. 
William Wright said about half of the 105 suspects charged were already in jail 
on other charges. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests -- made in surprise visits to the suspects' homes -- culminated a 
10-month investigation conducted by six officers of Anaheim's Special 
Operations Division Crime Task Force Unit, who bought everything from stolen 
tractors to television sets and guns from the suspects. The undercover officers 
said they bought the property from the suspects out of a rented Anaheim 
apartment, where the 220 purchases were videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said the officers paid about $29,000 to suspects to recover the stolen 
items -- or about 2 cents on the dollar. Police said officers were able to 
return 99% of the property.

Nepal's lifelines were almost completely cut today as India closed vital routes 
between the landlocked Himalayan nation and the rest of the world as part of a 
trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Trade and transit treaties between the countries expired Thursday with 
negotiations for renewal at an impasse. India, which blames Katmandu for the 
problem, today closed all but two of the 13 transit routes on their common 
border, Nepali officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mountainous Nepal, sandwiched between India and China, relies on India for 
almost half its total imports and most essential commodities. Although Katmandu 
has said there are comfortable reserves of essential commodities, rationing of 
kerosene and other basics has already begun.

The lawyer of an alleged gang leader being hunted for the kidnaping of a former 
Belgian prime minister has been arrested on suspicion of masterminding the 
abduction, the prosecutors office said today. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Vander Elst, 41, was placed under arrest after nine hours of questioning 
on suspicion of being "the author, co-author or an accomplice in the kidnap" of 
Paul Vanden Boeynants, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Other accusations included extortion and forgery. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer denied the accusations, saying he was faced with the problem of 
professional secrecy in defending himself, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Vander Elst represents Patrick Haemers, 36, the alleged leader of a gang being 
hunted by police for a string of unsolved violent crimes, including the 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Vanden Boeynants was snatched in the garage of his Brussels home on Jan. 14 and 
released a month later after a ransom of up to $2.5 million had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there were three elements which led to the arrest of Vander 
Elst, who lives in the same apartment building as Vanden Boeynants. 
</P>
<P>
He had seen some of the suspected kidnapers after they had rented a villa in 
the northern French resort of Le Touquet where Vanden Boeynants was manacled to 
a wall for a month. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer had also received phone calls from public booths in Le Touquet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition his fingerprints were found in a Brussels apartment police think 
the gang used when it planned the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Haemers, billed as Belgium's public enemy No. 1, has been on the run since 
escaping from police custody in a commando-style raid 19 months ago.

The Union of Flight Attendants called off its five-day strike against Frank 
Lorenzo's Continental Airlines today but refused to admit the walkout had 
little impact on the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Continental had reported only a handful of flight delays and put the number of 
strikers at only 180 out of 6,500 flight attendants. But the union, which 
claimed 1,200 attendants walked off the job, maintained it caused disruptions 
of Continental's flight schedule throughout the job action. 
</P>
<P>
The union said its short-lived strike also accomplished the objective of 
publicizing the flight attendants' poor working conditions. Continental flight 
attendants have worked more than five years without a contract.

CHINA ATTEMPTS TO GRAPPLE WITH 18.5% INFLATION

China, struggling to stem record inflation and public unrest over the spiraling 
cost of living, announced a series of measures today to restore central 
government price controls that were dropped under the country's economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The measures, the latest taken by the government in a sweeping retrenchment of 
the market-oriented reforms launched by senior leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978, 
were announced by a Chinese official at a meeting of the ongoing session of 
China's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The package included a ban on local governments' approving price hikes without 
authorization from Beijing. The meeting was reported by the official New China 
News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Price reform -- ending artificially set low prices and allowing the market to 
reflect major commodity prices -- has proven the most controversial of the 
economic reforms. Although giving incentive to producers, it has contributed to 
record inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vast Consumer Demand 
</P>
<P>
Inflation, unknown in China until recent years, ran officially at 18.5% last 
year and is estimated unofficially at more than 30%, in part reflecting vast 
consumer demand on a still-inefficient supply system and erratic monetary 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng, in a speech Monday to the opening session of the National 
People's Congress, the nominal legislature, called inflation the key problem 
the country faces and warned of several years of tighter central control and 
austerity. 
</P>
<P>
At an NPC session today, Ma Kai, vice director of the State Price 
Administration, said the State Council, China's cabinet, would set "price 
control goals" for provincial and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, officials would "concentrate pricing power in the 
central government," adding that no local government would be allowed to 
approve price hikes on goods without State Council authorization. 
</P>
<P>
The measures also include efforts to increase the supply of daily necessities, 
tighten controls on prices of energy, raw materials and agriculture-oriented 
products, possibly through price ceilings, and establish a system by which 
local governments would apply in advance to hike prices of major commodities.

Planters LifeSavers Co. hopes customers hungry for nostalgia will savor the 
return of its old-fashioned flavors not seen on store shelves in decades. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Holland plant recently began producing the "Limited Edition 
Nostalgia Flavors" -- "Lic-O-Rice," "Choc-O-Late" and "Pepsin." Stores began 
carrying them a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the limited edition flavors were developed in the 1920s. 
Lic-O-Rice and Pepsin were discontinued in 1938, and Choc-O-Late was produced 
until 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society's general interest in nostalgia is booming these days, and many 
Americans associate LifeSavers candy with warm memories of their childhood and 
quieter, simpler life styles," said Jeff Walters, associate product manager for 
the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the three flavors will be sold for a limited time in a 
response to consumers' requests. 
</P>
<P>
When LifeSavers candies first rolled into stores in 1912, Pep-O-Mint was the 
only flavor available. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, 45 flavors have been sold at various times, and 34 billion 
rolls have been purchased. Currently, 17 flavors are on the market.

About 225,000 foreign tourists visited Cuba last year, a 13% rise over 1987, 
according to National Tourist Board figures published today. 
</P>
<P>
They included 31,000 visitors from socialist countries. 
</P>
<P>
That share has remained stable over the last few years, and the government has 
launched an ambitious development plan to attract more hard-currency tourists 
with the aim of luring 600,000 visitors from the Western world by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The travel board said earnings increased 20% over 1987. It gave no exact 
figures, but that increase would mean that hard-currency income from tourism 
topped $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
The official target is to have this revenue grow tenfold by the year 2000, 
which would then make tourism the island's top hard-currency earner.

Supplies of meat and frozen foods reached the strike-bound capital of Corsica 
for the first time in a week today as trade unionists gradually lifted a 
blockade of the island's ports and airports. The arrival of 1,500 metric tons 
of food was greeted with relief by crowds of Corsicans hit by shortages of 
meat, cigarettes and medicine during strikes over the high cost of living on 
the Mediterranean island. 
</P>
<P>
Trade unionists, who stopped work five weeks ago demanding a bonus to offset 
high prices, appeared to have virtually lifted their seven-day blockade of sea 
and air traffic. Some French airline companies announced resumption of 
scheduled flights on the eve of the Easter break, and chartered flights from 
Britain and West Germany were also due to land. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of the CGT trade union, Noel Zicchina, escaped an 
assassin's bullet Thursday night as he and hundreds of fellow trade unionists 
occupied the port at Ajaccio. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 civil servants and private sector workers -- a quarter of the 
Corsican work force -- are on strike. The government is resisting their 
demands, saying taxes have been scrapped on items such as cigarettes and 
alcohol, and other goods are subsidized.

CALLBOARD'S 'ON TINA TUNA WALK' -- IT'S A GAY COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Glines' "On Tina Tuna Walk" that opened Thursday night at the Callboard 
Theatre in West Hollywood sounds like specialty sushi or stir-fried tuna. It is 
neither. Call it specialty theater. The name refers to one of the walkways in 
the Pines on Fire Island, an overtly gay community, and the comedy that follows 
is not "John Loves Mary," but Michael loves Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Comedy requires complications. These are provided with unbridled zest and 
campiness by Michael's friends Eddie (Eddie Cobb), Russell (Scott Allyn) and JJ 
(Jay Acovone), the only straight guy in the group. In their effort to cure 
Michael (Gregg Marx) from pining after his dead lover, they set him up with 
Paul (Michael Hartson), a ringer for the dear departed. 
</P>
<P>
The plot's twists and turns are seriocomic soap opera, less important than the 
mix of printable and unprintable -- often zinging -- one-liners on which they 
rely. Glines has a generous heart and knows how to put a play together. In 
Eddie, the mother superior who runs the show and rules the roost (variously 
outfitted as Lady Bracknell, Tokyo Rose or whatever else), he captures the 
epitome of the pushy-hilarious queen. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb, who inspired as well as created the role Off Broadway, gives an 
unfettered, outre performance worth the price of admission. He is ably 
supported by everyone else and except for a couple of brief sags in the second 
act, director Peter Pope (who staged "Torch Song Trilogy" on Broadway, produced 
by Glines) knows how to balance restraint and excess and keep the comic tempo 
thumping. 
</P>
<P>
The smart set, costumes and lights (by Matthew Moore, Ina Raye and George 
Gizienski, respectively), give a lift to the Callboard stage. 
</P>
<P>
"On Tina Tuna Walk" is slight fare, but fun. It won't be for all markets. It is 
comedy about and aimed at the gay community for which it's bound to hold the 
greatest appeal -- and which should keep it running for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8451 Melrose Place, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 3 and 8 
p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: $15; (213) 466-1767.

ICE CUBE KEEPS COOL, CHILLS CLASH

<TEXT>
<P>
Rap music, already widely linked in the public mind to gang violence, came 
within a heartbeat of another black mark Thursday night when a fight broke out 
near the stage during N.W.A.'s concert at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
It was an especially delicate moment because N.W.A. is the hot new Los 
Angeles-area group whose sometimes X-rated tales about gang violence are 
already drawing criticisms from those who feel the records glorify gang 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the regular precaution for rap shows at the 2,500-seat theater, 
security guards held hand metal detection devices against everyone who entered 
the building and made women open their purses. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the atmosphere was calm as the three opening acts served up rap with 
varying degrees of effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
But the intensity level increased dramatically when N.W.A. walked on stage 
shortly after 9:30 and soon went into "Gangsta, Gangsta" and "---- tha Police," 
two of the most provocative numbers on the quintet's "Straight Outta Compton" 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the equally graphic "Dopeman," the fight broke out and a chill 
of tension swept the hall. Ice Cube, one of the principal N.W.A. writers and 
rappers, saw the flurry of activity and was faced with a challenge. Would he 
maintain the group's "neutrality" stance or simply ignore what was going on to 
appear cool? 
</P>
<P>
In a brave and revealing moment, Ice Cube, 19, stopped the song and used the 
microphone to try to combat the potential flare-up. Speaking in the same angry 
tone as the song, he shouted: "This ain't (the movie) 'Colors'. . . . You 
didn't come to see a fight, you came to see a concert.' " 
</P>
<P>
With the help of security guards, order was quickly restored, although about 40 
males later spilled outside, causing nearby Anaheim police to dispatch a dozen 
squad cars. The youths then raced away; no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the theater the concert continued uneventfully. Ice-T, who helped 
popularize the L.A. gangster rap image, was the evening's headliner, but N.W.A. 
was the more galvanizing force. For all its crudeness, the group -- which also 
includes Eazy-E, MC Ren, Dr. Dre and D. J. Yella -- exhibits a sense of 
artistic spirit and vision.

<P>
In the second major management change at the syndicated program in the last 
five months, "USA Today on TV" got a new executive producer Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kirby, who has been president and general manager of Gannett-owned KOCO-TV 
in Oklahoma City, will start work Monday out at the Rosslyn, Va., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bellows, who stepped in as managing editor last fall, replacing Steve 
Friedman as executive producer when the widely publicized but overproduced week 
night show faltered and almost died in the ratings, will return to New York, 
where he will continue to serve as a consultant to the program. 
</P>
<P>
Bellows succeeded in turning the program around, eventually reducing the number 
of anchors from four to two and establishing a more conventional format that 
has slowly rebuilt viewership at most of the 150 stations still on the client 
list. In February, the program had a national Nielsen rating of 6, up 11% from 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Tinker, president of GTG Entertainment, Thursday praised Bellows as a 
"brilliant editor who came to 'USA Today on TV' at a critical time in its first 
year. He has completed the task of reshaping the show and giving it new 
direction. As we've always planned, Jim will now return to his home in New York 
and will continue to serve as a valued consultant to our show."

The daughter of former Detroit Tigers pitcher Mickey Lolich has been placed on 
three years' probation for stealing $70,000 in coins and jewelry -- including 
her father's 1968 World Series ring -- from her parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland County Circuit Judge David Breck on Thursday also ordered Stacy 
Michelle Lolich, 19, to undergo periodic drug testing and abstain from alcohol. 
Breck said he doesn't believe she has a substance abuse problem but he ordered 
the tests as a safeguard. Stacy Lolich and John Ellenbrook, 22, of Lake Orion 
were charged last July with stealing the items from her parents' home in 
Washington, Mich. Some items were recovered.

The investigation of gambling allegations involving Cincinnati Reds Manager 
Pete Rose has expanded into a multi-state inquiry into sports betting linked to 
organized crime, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Daily News in a copyrighted story said a source close to the inquiry 
said investigators are looking into allegations of substantial debts Rose may 
owe to bookmakers with alleged ties to organized crime. The newspaper did not 
identify its source. 
</P>
<P>
The widening investigation of Rose's alleged gambling will delay any action by 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth until at least next week, the newspaper quoted a 
source in the commissioner's office as saying. The source said, "With all the 
additional information coming in, the investigation has become far-reaching," 
the newspaper reported.

The head of the Environmental Protection Agency ordered a review today of a 
controversial, $500-million dam project in Colorado, saying he is concerned 
that the dam "could result in very serious adverse environmental impact." 
</P>
<P>
The Two Forks dam project on the South Platte River southwest of Denver has 
been approved by the Army Corps of Engineers, but the EPA can veto it if it 
determines that the dam would be environmentally harmful. Environmentalists 
have said that the EPA's decision on the dam will be a barometer of how the 
Bush Administration intends to deal with such issues.

Because of an error by L.A. International Airport officials, The Times was 
given incorrect figures for the number of January tons of cargo. The correct 
comparative figures for L.A. International Airport in January were: 90,264 tons 
of cargo in 1989 and 91,318 tons of cargo in 1988, representing a 1% decrease.
