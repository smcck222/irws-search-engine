BIG LEAKS IN THE EXPLOSIVE FILE; 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISTS NOW ON THE DEFENSIVE -- FOR A CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Semtex is an odorless, pliable, enormously potent explosive, virtually 
undetectable by conventional airport-screening devices or sniffer dogs. A mere 
200 grams of the chemical -- about 7 ounces -- is enough to blow an airliner 
out of the sky. Tragically, it's been used to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
Residues of Semtex were found in the wreckage of a French UTA DC-10 that 
exploded over Niger in 1989, killing 170 people. Security experts say Semtex 
destroyed Pan Am's Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 
people. Czechoslovakia is the sole manufacturer of Semtex. In the 1980s, its 
Communist regime sold Libya 1,000 tons of the stuff. Dictator Moammar Kadafi 
didn't buy all that Semtex to blast tree stumps out of the desert. Instead, 
Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist President Vaclav Havel now confirms, Kadafi 
gave much of it to terrorists. Hundreds of innocent people died as a direct 
result. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia is now out of the Semtex exporting business, but, unhappily, 
terrorists aren't out of Semtex. Havel calculates that there is enough in 
hostile hands to present a threat for decades to come. This is only one of 
probably many revelations about the extent of past Communist links with 
terrorism that can be expected to see the light of day as Communist rule in 
much of Eastern Europe comes to an end. 
</P>
<P>
The files of the security and intelligence services of East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania -- assuming they aren't destroyed -- could 
prove to be especially revealing. All of these countries are known to have 
given training and equipment to terrorists and facilitated their clandestine 
travel. In some cases it's clear that Communist secret services worked 
intimately with other regimes to provide such aid. East Germany's notorious 
Stasi, for example, is believed to have cooperated closely with Syria to aid 
terrorist activities in Western Europe. What's emerging as the East European 
world changes is the good chance that a bonanza of information and insights 
about terrorism could soon become available, even as the networks that 
terrorists could once count on in these countries are shut down. The bad guys, 
for a change, would be going on the defensive.

PEACE PROSPECTS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ARABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must protest. Your Op-Ed Page of March 8 demonstrates very little objectivity 
and a great deal of anti-Israel bias. The columns, "Dollars to Settlements, 
Dollars Less in Aid" (by Alton Frye) and "Kohl Doesn't Show Effects of Winds of 
Reconciliation" (by William Pfaff), are prime examples as is the devious Conrad 
cartoon ("After the peace treaty is signed, we'll determine the borders!"). 
</P>
<P>
The Frye column is so badly twisted it would be utterly impossible to reply to 
it in a letter. The Pfaff column states, "The territory in question (Poland's 
annexed German border) was lost as a consequence of war . . . a war of 
aggression launched by Germany, a fact Kohl has seemed to deprecate. This war 
had, as one of its objectives, to 'erase from the human mind' even 'the concept 
of Poland.' " 
</P>
<P>
Exactly! Just substitute the Arabs for the Germans in wartime and Israel for 
Poland and you have the present picture. 
</P>
<P>
After all the wars initiated against Israel by Arab states, the total blackout 
of Israel from Arab maps, the kidnapings, hijackings, terrorist bombings, 
wouldn't you say Israel has good reason to doubt her enemies motives and 
promises? It would seem Israel's crime, in the eyes of the world, was in 
winning defensive wars no one expected her to win against great odds. 
</P>
<P>
As William Buckley Jr. ("Annex the West Bank") puts it, "To declare, simply, 
that by right of conquest, the West Bank is theirs and therefore it follows 
that everyone who lives and works there is a guest of the government of Israel. 
The 1967 war was initiated by Jordan and was won triumphantly by Israel; from 
which it follows that it is entitled, if it chooses, to hang on to conquered 
territory."

Buckley's column is representative of a racist, might-over-morality ideology 
that is becoming obsolete in the wake of the dramatic collapse of oppressive 
regimes in Eastern Europe and the impending demise of apartheid in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley writes that a perpetuation of Israel's subjugation of Palestinians by 
annexing the occupied territories would lead to "the kind of strategic 
composure that comes from the knowledge that that is the way things are, and we 
had all better get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Before proposing such a ridiculous scheme, Buckley should consider how other 
peoples have "gotten used" to repression. If there is anything we have learned 
from recent events in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, it is that no government 
can impose its iron will on an entire population indefinitely, and Israel is no 
exception.

GROWTH IN SAN LUIS OBISPO

<TEXT>
<P>
I'm afraid that Deasy must be confused by the incessant wind and ambient 
radiation that inflicts that region of the state between Buellton and King 
City. 
</P>
<P>
There is no San Luis Obispo County. I have been told that there is a San Luis 
Obispo somewhere in Mexico; perhaps along the Pacific coast. In my travels I 
have usually found that region midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco 
dominated by boring dry hills, twisted dead trees, an immense nuclear reactor 
and the largest prison population for any region its size in the state. The 
traveler is well-advised to drive I-5 when going north or south; food and 
lodging are reasonable along that ever-fascinating rural wonderland.

In response to Frye's column: 
</P>
<P>
Poland, Panama, Nicaragua and other countries have to beg for foreign aid 
crumbs while Israel without any debate or public discussion received another 
$200 million in military aid, which increases the acknowledged military aid 
package to $2 billion (March 9). 
</P>
<P>
Aid to Israel must be linked to progress on peace, which Israeli intransigence 
is impeding. Logically, if there is peace, then the need for weapons will 
diminish -- a Middle East "peace dividend." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, let's not squander our "peace dividend" by financing a Middle East 
missile race.

We are outraged with President Bush's statement questioning Jewish settlement 
in East Jerusalem. Jews have the unassailable right to live in any neighborhood 
in Jerusalem, just as all people do. 
</P>
<P>
We at Hadassah remember when the city was divided before 1967 and Jews were 
prohibited from living in East Jerusalem. We remember when our hospital on Mt. 
Scopus was cut off and the doctors and nurses were brutally ambushed and 
murdered. Jewish holy places were destroyed and Jews could not pray at the 
Western Wall. The city was a battle zone. 
</P>
<P>
Since its reunification in 1967, Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, has 
flourished. The city is free, united and at peace. At Hadassah's hospital on 
Mt. Scopus, people of all faiths receive equal care. 
</P>
<P>
Today, people of all religions and backgrounds live and worship freely in all 
parts of Jerusalem. Christians, Jews and Muslims have unrestricted access to 
their holy places. This is the current status of Jerusalem, and it is not 
negotiable.

DEBATE OVER YOSEMITE'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several commentaries on Yosemite Valley, including David Brower's "Give 'Em 
Bouquets, Not Bricks" (Editorial Page, March 10), brought back memories of my 
father's story of his first visit to Yosemite in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
He told of the train trip from Los Angeles to El Portal and the ride into the 
valley on a stagecoach. "Breathtaking, peaceful beauty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His next trip to Yosemite Valley was in 1940. His comment after that trip was, 
"The automobile has ruined my beautiful Yosemite."

U.S.-BUILT CAR, TRUCK SALES DECLINE 9.5%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of North American-built cars and trucks tumbled 9.5% in mid-March 
compared to a weak period last year as the absence of big rebates, especially 
on trucks, showed its effect, auto makers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The nine major auto makers with U.S. plants said they sold cars and trucks at 
an average daily rate of 35,497 during March 11-20 this year, compared to a 
rate of 39,225 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales slipped 8.9% while truck sales were down 10.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The slide in truck sales, which make up 38% of all vehicles sold in the United 
States, may end soon. On Thursday, General Motors Corp., for the first time, 
offered $1,000 rebates on its three-vehicle line of front-wheel-drive minivans. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. already was offering a $500 rebate on its Aerostar minivan. 
</P>
<P>
When Chrysler Corp. offered incentives on its market-leading minivans in late 
December and January, sales soared. But since the incentives expired, sales 
have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler led the decline in mid-March sales with a 29.9% drop in car sales and 
a 23.3% decline in truck sales, combining for a 26.6% overall sales skid. 
</P>
<P>
"The minivan incentives probably created a lot of sales for them but pulled 
sales from March," said auto analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; 
Co. of New York. "More definitively, the Omni-Horizon has been discontinued, so 
they are not pushing those." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler stopped making those subcompact cars, which accounted for about 79,500 
sales last year, in early February when the No. 3 auto maker closed a plant in 
Detroit. The company currently has no large-volume subcompact car. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-March sales at GM and Ford fell less drastically than at Chrysler. GM's 
combined car and truck sales were 9.5% lower during the period and Ford's were 
down 8.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in mid-March last year were below what proved to be the trend for the 
entire year, and this year the demand appears down from that.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has scheduled a news conference for 
Monday to unveil its plan to offer MasterCard and Visa credit cards in a bid to 
boost revenue from consumers, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
An AT&amp;T spokesman confirmed that the company has planned a news conference 
for 1 p.m. EST Monday for "a major consumer service" announcement but declined 
to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
The company has said it is investigating financial services products and 
recently hired several top-notch people from the credit card and financial 
services industry. 
</P>
<P>
"People are speculating it is either a MasterCard or Visa," said Greg Sawers, 
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Analysts previously said AT&amp;T 
has hired a financial services banking firm to process credit card services 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said they expect there will be some start-up costs that could 
shave a few cents off AT&amp;T's 1990 and 1991 earnings but that the cards 
should eventually boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T shares, which trade ex-dividend Monday, closed up 12.5 cents at $41.50 
and were the most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

PEOPLE: RICHARD KEATING QUITS TOP POST AT SKIDMORE, OWINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran architect Richard Keating, who designed the Columbia Savings &amp; Loan 
office building in Beverly Hills, has announced his resignation as 
partner-in-charge at the Los Angeles office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, 
effective Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, 45, joined the Los Angeles office in May, 1986, after leaving the 
Houston office, which he opened and ran for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
He first joined the firm in Chicago in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an amicable parting of ways," Keating said in a news release. He could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"My years at SOM were good ones. I feel well prepared for a change, and I am 
excited and energized by the prospects of a new challenge," said Keating. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Keating will continue to work for Skidmore, Owings &amp; 
Merrill, overseeing projects under way, such as the Pacific Atlas Office 
Building &amp; Hotel in Los Angeles, said Deanie Nyman, his spokeswoman. Nyman 
said Keating will announce his plans in October. 
</P>
<P>
When he first joined the Los Angeles office, Keating quickly restructured it. 
"The design ideas, the quality of the detailing, the caliber of the management 
were all below the levels we demand," he said in a 1988 interview. 
</P>
<P>
Among his high-rise projects, Keating designed the 50-story Trammel Crow Center 
(formerly the LTV Tower) and the 55-story Texas Commerce Tower in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
A San Francisco native, Keating graduated from UC Berkeley.

S&amp;L Cuts Capital Needs: Glenfed Inc., the parent of Glendale Federal Bank, 
said it improved its capital position by paying another party to cover 
potential losses on $1 billion worth of home loans that it sold to investors. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the move, Glenfed said it now needs about $24 million less 
capital to meet tougher new federal standards for S&amp;Ls. The capital 
standards are designed to force S&amp;Ls to have a cushion against losses. 
Glenfed declined to reveal the terms of the deal or name the other party. 
Glenfed had assets of $25.26 billion as of Dec. 31.

MONEY TALK: HOW TO BUY TREASURY SECURITIES BY MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I need information regarding the purchase of Treasury bonds, bills 
and notes. At what locations can they be bought? Is there a fee? Are there 
specific times during the year when they are for sale? Do you pay federal taxes 
on them? Do you pay state taxes on them? -- A. H. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Treasury securities, the generic name for bonds, bills and notes, can 
be purchased from several outlets. Banks and brokers sell them, but often 
charge a fee of as much as $25 per security. Perhaps you might be more 
interested in making your purchase directly from the U.S. government, which 
charges no fee. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds, ranging in maturity from 10-30 years, are available in $1,000 increments 
to a maximum of $1 million from the Federal Reserve Bank or any of its 
branches. The Los Angeles branch is located at 950 S. Grand. You may also buy 
bonds by mail through the Bureau of the Public Debt, Washington, 20239. 
Personal checks are accepted. Bonds are traditionally auctioned four times a 
year -- in February, May, August and November -- and the interest rates paid by 
the bonds are set then. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bills and notes are shorter-term instruments than bonds. T-bills, as 
they are known, are sold in 3-, 6- and 12-month maturities and are available in 
$5,000 increments from a minimum of $10,000 to a maximum of $1 million. 
Three-month and 6-month bills are auctioned every Monday; 12-month bills are 
sold once a month. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury notes come in a variety of maturities and amounts. Two-year and 
three-year notes are available in increments of $5,000 from a minimum of $5,000 
to a maximum of $1 million. Four-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year notes are available in 
increments of $1,000 from a minimum of $1,000 to a maximum of $1 million. 
Two-year notes are sold monthly; the rest are sold quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
You may buy any of the bills or notes directly from any Federal Reserve branch, 
or by mail. Before buying through the mail, you are well advised to establish a 
"Treasury Direct" account with the Federal Reserve. For appropriate forms, 
Southern California residents may write to the Federal Reserve at P.O. Box 2077 
Terminal Annex, Los Angeles, Calif. 90051. Mark your envelope "Attention: 
Securities Information." You may also obtain a detailed auction schedule by 
writing to the same address. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have opened a mail-order account, you may order T-bills or notes by 
sending a check payable to the Federal Reserve Bank. Treasury bill purchases 
must be accompanied by a cashier's check; for Treasury notes, a personal check 
will suffice. Again, Southern California residents would reach the local 
Reserve branch at P.O. Box 2077 Terminal Annex, Los Angeles, Calif. 90051. 
Certified mail is recommended to ensure that the order arrives at least one day 
prior to the auction. 
</P>
<P>
Interest paid on Treasury securities is exempt from state and local taxes but 
not federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Few Are Eligible to Choose Own Tax Year 
</P>
<P>
Q: I don't quite understand the optional taxable year section of my income tax 
form. May I pick the beginning and end of my own tax year? This would be 
helpful since my last paycheck for 1989 covered only until Dec. 17. Can I just 
make my tax year from Jan. 1 to Dec. 17? Also, I was married on Dec. 31. Must I 
file as married, or -- if my tax year ends Dec. 17 -- may I file as a single 
individual? It would be nice to avoid the "marriage penalty." -- A. R. 
</P>
<P>
A: For a variety of reasons, which we'll detail below, you are probably stuck 
with the traditional Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 tax year like the rest of us. Further, 
because you were married as of Dec. 31 -- and regardless of the tax year matter 
-- you are required to file your tax return as married. 
</P>
<P>
According to our tax experts, the provision for choosing the taxable year is 
meant for businesses, not individuals, unless you can persuade the Internal 
Revenue Service that you have a pretty good reason for deviating from the pack. 
And even if you could persuade the IRS, you would have to select the dates of 
your tax year the very first time you filed your income tax return. Finally, 
your tax year must end on the final day of a month.

PERSONAL FINANCE: SIFTING FACTS FROM THE CONFUSION ABOUT IRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tax-filing deadline is near. Do you know what you should do with your 
individual retirement account? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many folks don't. Financial institution hype and lingering tax 
reform confusion has left many investors with misconceptions about IRAs. Many 
are still eligible for IRA deductions but don't know it. Others are eligible 
but should put their money in some other tax-deferred vehicle. Others put IRA 
money in all the wrong places. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the most common IRA misconceptions: 
</P>
<P>
"IRAs are the best way to defer taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Several tax-deferral vehicles are generally considered superior to IRAs. 
One is the 401(k) company savings plan. It allows you to contribute as much as 
nearly $8,000 each year on a before-tax basis -- far more than the $2,000 IRA 
limit. And many companies match your contribution by as much as 50% -- no IRA 
does that. 
</P>
<P>
Another superior vehicle -- if you are self-employed -- is a Keogh plan. It 
allows you to contribute and deduct far more than the $2,000 annual limit on 
IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if you cannot deduct your IRA contributions, consider tax-free municipal 
bonds or tax-free bond mutual funds. Their interest income accumulates tax free 
-- rather than just tax deferred as in an IRA. And you won't incur an early 
withdrawal penalty if you need to sell them to get cash. 
</P>
<P>
"The safest investments, such as certificates of deposit, are most suitable for 
IRAs." 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Your IRA investment mix should be determined by your age and tolerance 
for risk. If you are younger and far away from retirement, you can and should 
take greater risks; invest at least some of your IRA in stocks, which have a 
higher potential for appreciation in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
You can invest IRA money in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, junk bonds, U.S. Eagle 
gold coins, real estate investment trusts -- almost anything except such risky 
investments as commodity futures. Indeed, advisers say, most investors' IRAs 
are not diversified enough. You don't have to have all your IRA eggs in one 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have a retirement plan at work, I'm not eligible for an IRA." 
</P>
<P>
Fact: If you participate in a company retirement plan and your income exceeds 
certain levels, your IRA contributions are not deductible. But you can still 
have one. And the buildup of earnings in IRAs is always tax deferred. That's a 
powerful advantage over taxable investments outside an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't invest in an IRA because I don't have $2,000." 
</P>
<P>
Fact: You could put in as little as $1 to an IRA, although banks and brokerages 
usually require minimum contributions of at least $25. So don't choose not to 
contribute to an IRA just because you don't have $2,000 available at any one 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I must make my annual IRA contribution all at once and by the April deadline." 
</P>
<P>
Fact: You can contribute to your IRA any time and as often as you like, 
provided that your total contributions per year don't exceed $2,000. However, 
contributions must be made before the April tax-filing deadline (April 16 this 
year) to be eligible for deductions on the previous year's return. Some 
companies offer payroll savings plans that allow you to have a certain amount 
deducted from your paycheck and deposited automatically in an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
"Once my money's in an IRA, I can't get access to it without incurring a tax 
and penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Fact: The law allows you to roll over IRA money once every 365-day period, and 
the money is not taxable to you -- nor are you liable for the 10% early 
withdrawal penalty -- as long as you roll it back into an IRA within 60 days. 
That, in effect, allows you to borrow short term from your IRA. Just be sure to 
put it back within 60 days.

TOKYO MARKET'S ADVANCE HELPS DOW RISE 8.56 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market scored a modest gain Friday, helped by an overnight rise in 
the Tokyo stock market but pressured by fears of higher U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks gained 8.56 points to close at 
2,704.28, after a steep 32.21-point loss Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached a modest 132 million shares, 
compared to 175.9 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 884 up, 571 down and 527 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"We did see some decent buying this morning," said Tom Callahan at Yamaichi 
International. "Psychology is recovering; maybe the worst of the blood bath is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's move was not nearly strong enough to offset the massive selling 
pressure that left the Dow index down 36.94 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the market tried to stage a comeback. New York traders picked up the 
trend in Tokyo, where the badly battered market rebounded Friday from a sharp 
loss. The key Nikkei 225-share index rose 528.82 points, or 1.77%, to 30,372.16 
after a 3.13% fall Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The market also got a boost from the Commerce Department's report of a modest 
3.3% rise in February orders for durable goods after a record fall in January. 
</P>
<P>
The market, however, sagged quickly following a news report from Japan that the 
Japanese government may issue dollar-denominated bonds in an effort to support 
the sagging yen, raising fears that the bond market may be flooded with a new 
supply of issues that would lower prices and lift interest rates on bonds. High 
interest rates could also pressure stocks. 
</P>
<P>
IBM was down 1 1/2 at 105. A newspaper report said the computer giant has told 
customers it won't deliver an upgrade to its line of mainframe computers this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices also closed sharply higher on London's Stock Exchange, propelled 
by a burst of buying when a new two-week trading account opened. The Financial 
Times 100-share index was up 25 points, or 1.1%, at 2,283.9 at the close. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Rise on Economic Signs 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices posted small gains after a volatile session during which prices 
climbed on new signs of economic weakness and fell on worries that the Japanese 
may start issuing dollar-denominated securities. 
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/8 point, or about $1.25 per $1,000 
in face value. Its yield slipped to 8.47% from 8.48% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices initially rose after the government released its 
durable goods report. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year bond rose more than 3/4 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 in face 
value, on that news. 
</P>
<P>
But Wood said prices lost ground after the news report that the Japanese 
government may be considering issuing dollar-denominated securities. 
</P>
<P>
The report raised fears that the market would be unable to absorb the extra 
bond supply. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Goes Higher Except Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mostly higher in domestic and foreign trading but fell sharply 
against the yen as investors regained some confidence in the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a rise in interest rates in Japan and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 
recovery following a string of steep losses helped support the yen, which 
itself has fallen sharply in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc., said traders 
believed that Japanese yields would go even higher, which would make the yen 
even more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to 154.30 yen in New York from 155.095 late Thursday. In Tokyo 
early Friday, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to a closing 155.07 yen, and in London, 
it was quoted at a sharply lower rate of 153.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Gold Futures Fall in Heavy Selling 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices tumbled to 4 1/2-month lows Friday on New York's Commodity 
Exchange amid heavy European selling as the dollar resumed its advance against 
most other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, silver also retreated; grains and soybeans fell; 
energy future advanced, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $5.30 to $5.60 lower, with the contract for delivery in 
April at $389.40 an ounce, the lowest settlement for a near-month gold contract 
since Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures ended 4.1 to 4.7 cents lower in New York, with March at $5.043 
an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said buying interest in gold has faded as prices have skidded from 
near $430 an ounce over the past six weeks. April gold fell by $11.50 in this 
week alone. 
</P>
<P>
Gold is traded in dollars on the world market, so a stronger dollar makes the 
metal more expensive in terms of other currencies, discouraging foreign buying. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said gold's decline in the face of global political and economic 
uncertainty suggests other factors are also at play.

TV'S 'FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS': IS IT DISGUISED CHILD ABUSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My, but isn't Mr. Rosenberg righteously upset over children being "injured" on 
"Funniest Home Videos." 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that there are thousands of incidents of murder and other violent 
crimes, child abuse and abandonment, portrayed on television each year. 
</P>
<P>
Now along comes genuine slices of life in "Funniest Videos," and Rosenberg 
rises up to censure it on humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Normal" TV and movies are far more destructive in their indoctrination than a 
few home videos.

Thanks to Rosenberg for taking a responsible stand. As a mother of two, I have 
applied many an ice pack and more than a few Band-Aids. I just didn't know 
enough to have the camera rolling when those unfortunate household accidents 
occurred!

FACES . . . : FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Though "The Godfather" was released nearly two decades ago, people still 
recognize Abe Vigoda for his role in the Oscar-winner as the Mafia leader, 
Tessio -- especially airline stewardesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy the cassette of the film and read me all my lines," he says. "They go 
over to me and say, 'Will you get me off the hook for old time's sake?' They 
say, 'Hello, Tessio. How are you?"' 
</P>
<P>
Vigoda, 69, was a 30-year veteran of the New York theater when he was cast in 
"The Godfather." Suddenly, he was hot property. Hollywood beckoned and the New 
York-native landed prominent roles in such films as "The Don Is Dead" and 
"Newman's Law," and became a major TV star as the grumpy, tired Detective Fish 
on the comedy series, "Barney Miller." But after Vigoda's spin-off series 
"Fish" was canceled in 1978, the actor seemed to disappear from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're not on TV in a regular basis people feel you're retired," Vigoda 
confesses. "But that was never the case with me. I have always worked." 
</P>
<P>
Vigoda has spent most of the past decade keeping busy by doing theater. 
</P>
<P>
It was out of left field, Vigoda says, that he was cast as John Travolta's 
feisty 100-year-old grandfather in last fall's surprise blockbuster, "Look 
Who's Talking?" He hasn't stopped working since. 
</P>
<P>
Vigoda's co-starring in the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan comedy, "Joe Versus the 
Volcano," and the Mafia comedy, "Keaton's Cop," in regional release. 
</P>
<P>
In "Joe," written and directed by Oscar-winner John Patrick Shanley of 
"Moonstruck" fame, Vigoda plays an unhappy Polynesian chief. "I had never met 
John, but he supposedly wrote this part for me," says Vigoda. "The film is sort 
of an offbeat comedy with tragic social significance. It's an epic." 
</P>
<P>
Vigoda is overjoyed Hollywood is knocking on his door again. "I'd like to 
continue doing feature films," he says. "But if a new series came along. . . ."

FACES . . . : A BLUESMAN'S SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call him "King of the Blues, but to hear B. B. King tell it, he doesn't 
live the life of royalty. 
</P>
<P>
"In this business, I've never felt like I had it made. It seems I'm never 
better than my last performance, almost as if I'm auditioning every night," 
says King, 64, who is mounting a European and Middle Eastern tour. 
</P>
<P>
Coming from this soft-spoken gentlemen of the 12-bar form, who tours up to 250 
days a year, these startling statements sound more like a reality check than a 
spoiled child's whinings. "Blues music has not been in the mainstream of music, 
it's not economically stable," says the great singer and guitarist, who 
headlines a show with Millie Jackson and Bobby "Blue" Bland Sunday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre in Universal City. "I would have to work a week to earn 
what my friends in rock or soul would do in a night. I feel I have to work this 
much in order to survive." 
</P>
<P>
King says that getting airplay for blues artists is gradually improving. 
"Listen to your radio and see how many blues records you hear," suggests the 
musician whose last hit record was 1969's "The Thrill Is Gone." "There aren't a 
lot but there are some. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock and rollers have been a big help too. Some of the people have said they 
started by playing the blues and that opens some doors, and hopefully my 
association with various groups (like U2, with whom King recorded in 1988, and 
Bonnie Raitt, who sang background vocals on his latest album) will open a few 
more doors to B. B. King." 
</P>
<P>
King feels the timeless quality of blues will, little by little, win more fans. 
"I believe that blues music, if it's played well and presented well, would be 
enjoyed by most people," he says. "Some people say blues is dated. Well, they 
play Mozart and Brahms and nobody calls them dated." ZAN STEWART

SANTAMARIA: TRUE TO ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mongo Santamaria, who was distilling Afro-Cuban sounds when that form of fusion 
was a brand new conversation piece, opened Tuesday with his band at Catalina's. 
</P>
<P>
The diminutive Havana-born maestro, almost buried behind his conga drums, is 
fielding essentially the same genre of jazz-inflected music that played a major 
role, during the 1960s, in the absorption of Latin rhythms into jazz, blues and 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
The octet, composed of two saxophones, trumpet, piano, electric bass and three 
percussionists, depends heavily on its rhythmic components. The arrangements 
for horns (among them William Allen's "Quiet Fire" and pianist Bob Quaranta's 
"Home") are no more sophisticated harmonically than they were two or three 
decades ago. The blend became less bland when the saxes switched to flutes and 
the capable trumpeter, Ray Vega, picked up his fluegelhorn. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian elements that have overlapped at times with Afro-Cuban music play 
an all but inaudible role here. The occasional unison vocals, and the repeated 
figures by the percussion section, evoked memories of pre-Castro Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
What interest the band generates is mainly provided by Eddie Rodriguez, equally 
nimble on bongos, cowbell and chekere, and by John Andreu, who plays drums and 
timbales. Except for a few blues touches in an alto solo by Bob Porcelli, the 
saxophones offered little individually in the way of originality or excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the most familiar and invigorating moments were provided in an 
encore, "Watermelon Man." Herbie Hancock, who wrote and recorded it in 1962, 
has since moved far beyond the brand of Latin jazz this song typified; 
meanwhile, Santamaria and his men remain loyal to their early roots.

'TENANTS' A CLEVER SOCIAL SATIRE THAT MAY BE METAPHOR FOR IRAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darioush Mehrjui's "The Tenants" (Monica 4-Plex) is a fresh breeze from Iran, 
of all places. Social satire is not what one would expect from the Iranian 
cinema just now, and it's all the more enjoyable as a result. What's more, the 
humor of this film, said to be the most popular in the history of the Iranian 
cinema, couldn't be more universal. 
</P>
<P>
On the desert-like outskirts of Tehran there stands, virtually in the middle of 
nowhere, a seedy apartment house that gives fresh meaning to the concept of 
shoddy construction. Ceilings are falling, pipes are bursting, but Abbas 
(Ezatolah Entezami), the paunchy, middle-aged manager, has reasons of his own 
for not only not making repairs but also forbidding the tenants to do so 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the fur starts to fly, with much shouting and fisticuffs and lots 
more people getting into the act, such as disgruntled repairmen who discover 
that no one is willing to pay them and several unscrupulous real estate 
wheeler-dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, amid the almost nonstop bombast, we realize that Mehrjui is viewing all 
these people in the round, with compassion and without passing judgment. That 
the tenants are in the right and Abbas is in the wrong does not prevent Mehrjui 
from illuminating the foibles of human nature in one and all and, beyond this, 
celebrating everyone's fundamental humanity. The film runs a bit long for a 
comedy, but its extra time is well spent. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, "The Tenants" is a surprising film for Mehrjui, a top Iranian 
filmmaker for two decades, considering the somberness of the two films, "The 
Cow" (1968) and "The Cycle" (1974), for which he is known in the West. The 
first deals with the dependency of a peasant (also played by Entezami) upon his 
cow, and the second, a masterpiece in the Neo-Realist style, tells of an old 
man and his grandson who come to Tehran in the last years of the shah's regime 
only to become destroyed by its corruption. 
</P>
<P>
If in that film the old man becoming forced to sell his blood takes on a 
clearly critical symbolism, can we not then take the apartment house of "The 
Tenants" (Times-rated Family) as a symbol of the state of contemporary Iranian 
society? Master of allegory that he is, Mehrjui shrewdly leaves the answers up 
to us.

HUMOR WEARS THIN IN 'GREATER TUNA' AT WESTWOOD PLAYHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Vacation in Texas -- and see why it's like visiting a whole other country." 
</P>
<P>
This was the first commercial message I heard from my car radio as I drove home 
from "Greater Tuna" at the Westwood Playhouse Wednesday. It almost could have 
been part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
The denizens of Tuna, Texas' third smallest town, are definitely different from 
you or me. This is not an affectionate tribute to our common humanity. It's a 
cartoon that depicts Tunans as intellectually and spiritually blighted folk who 
deserve nothing more than a few guffaws. 
</P>
<P>
They get those guffaws in "Greater Tuna." For those who have never seen Joe 
Sears and Jaston Williams playing 10 Tunans apiece, in the show they co-wrote 
with director Ed Howard, that may be enough. 
</P>
<P>
However, for those who already saw Sears and Williams do their show at Las 
Palmas Theatre in 1984, or at one of their other venues around the country or 
on Home Box Office, another visit to "Greater Tuna" may seem more like "Lesser 
Tuna." 
</P>
<P>
On second viewing, admiration for the performances, the costumes and the wigs 
gives way to impatience with the thinness of the writing and the supercilious 
quality of the laughter that results from such a shallow script. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the performances, costumes and wigs have slipped. Sears plays the big 
movers and shakers of Tuna, while Williams plays the little whiners, and 
neither of them indicates that this is their umpteenth time around the track 
with these characters. 
</P>
<P>
The two of them are funniest in drag. Williams endows the gun-hawking Didi 
Snavely with a ragged, nobody-knows-the-trouble-I've-seen voice; sighs 
magnificently as teen-aged Charlene Bumiller, who's traumatized over not making 
cheerleader; and minces majestically as Vera Carp, vice president of the Smut 
Snatchers. 
</P>
<P>
Sears' Bertha Bumiller is the most rock-solid characterization on stage, 
despite (or because of?) the mismatch between her girth and that sickly-green 
pantsuit she wears. His Aunt Pearl is a not-so-distant relative of Jonathan 
Winters' Aunt Maude. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Fisher's costumes are still a hoot, if hardly unexpected. For example, 
old Aunt Pearl wears lots of pearls, even on the hottest day of the summer, 
even as she goes about poisoning dogs in order to protect her chickens. R.R. 
Snavely (Sears again), who witnessed an unidentified flying chalupa, has a 
belly that will never stop sticking out from behind his denims. Vera's little 
hat looks like it, too, might be an unidentified flying object. 
</P>
<P>
There's a disdainful quality to most of the laughter this show provokes. The 
bigotry and narrow-mindedness of the Tunans and their ghastly fashions will 
allow enlightened Westsiders to congratulate themselves for not living in small 
towns. This is the cheapest kind of satire -- it makes its audience more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
The writers hardly bothered with hypocrisy, which should be a mother lode for 
small-town humor. For example, the title of a winning school essay is "Human 
Rights: Why Bother?" This gets a quick laugh, but it would have been a richer 
joke if the essay praised values that the writer's behavior then mocked. 
</P>
<P>
The only slight exception to the detachment we feel toward these people is with 
Bertha. In the big city, people have to cope with impossible children just as 
Bertha does. But some of our connection with her derives from hearing her admit 
that life isn't so rosy in Tuna. In other words, even Bertha confirms our 
prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
The show doesn't sound updated. When Bertha discusses books that should be 
removed from the library, her first targets are "Roots" and "Bury My Heart at 
Wounded Knee" -- '70s books that would probably have been replaced by fresher 
targets by now. While a change on this level would be superficial, at least it 
might give this "Tuna" a sharper hook. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10886 Le Conte Ave., Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 6 and 
9 p.m., Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m., indefinitely. $17.50-$25; (213) 410-1062.

SAN FRANCISCO'S 'KRAZY KAT': BETTER SCENERY THAN BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before "Dick Tracy" reaches the big screen and "Archie" hits network prime 
time, here comes "Krazy Kat" (the ballet), another vintage comic strip newly 
peopled for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Based on George Herriman's classic triangle -- dog loves cat but cat loves 
mouse -- this one-act dance-parable enlists principals and soloists from San 
Francisco Ballet, the choreography of Brenda Way (founder/director of the 
modern-dance company ODC/San Francisco) and a pile of snazzy jazz records by 
Jelly Roll Morton, Charles L. Roberts and William Bolcom. 
</P>
<P>
At the War Memorial Opera House on Thursday, however, "Krazy Kat" clearly 
belonged to painter Wayne Thiebaud, who created enormous still-life cutouts and 
landscapes (some massive enough for Wagnerian opera) in luminous watercolor 
pastels. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes black curtains and small scenic units isolated a character in space 
(Krazy Kat alone in the night). More often, the vista expanded to a full, 
multilevel stage with giant palm trees and other scenic elements providing an 
environment for dances by an 11-member "Cartoon Chorus (the dailies)" dressed 
in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
Besides punctuating the discontinuous, quasi-narrative episodes involving Krazy 
Cat, Ignatz Mouse and Offisa Pup, this chorus served as Way's primary 
choreographic focus -- dancing much more than the principal characters. 
However, their flurries of loose, wiggly, slumpy movement -- mostly performed 
in place -- never looked as purposeful or interesting on the big stage as such 
inspired scenic diversions as a "Swan Lake"-style procession of oversized ducks 
and a leisurely boat chase. 
</P>
<P>
Way seemed to be aiming for an anarchic, off-the-wall style -- a ballet made up 
as it went along in contrast to the rigid every-finger-in-place premeditation 
of the classical repertory. Nice idea, but her impacted vocabulary and 
constricted sense of space never yielded much satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
In the title role, the winsome Grace Maduell got a major solo only at the very 
end -- a katastrophic antiklimax. Val Caniparoli made a very appealing Offisa 
Pup but scarcely danced at all. And, as Ignatz, Christopher Stowell attacked 
his showcase opportunities energetically without making them particularly 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the otherwise familiar program: an uneven performance of James 
Kudelka's "Comfort Zone" that came fully alive only in the passages dominated 
by Elizabeth Loscavio, Antonio Castilla, Jamie Zimmerman and/or Christopher 
Boatwright. Helgi Tomasson's "Menuetto" featured excellent principals -- Evelyn 
Cisneros, Jim Sohm, Sabina Allemann and Ashley Wheater -- each of whom, alas, 
seemed to have a different concept of placement, timing and style.

CRAMER AT AMBASSADOR: LULL IN AN ELEVATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listening to Floyd Cramer's music at the Ambassador Auditorium on Wednesday was 
a bit like getting stuck in an elevator with a Muzak sound system. 
</P>
<P>
How about a medley consisting of "Yesterday," "Bridge Over Troubled Water" and 
"The Way We Were"? Or a collection of such piano-oriented pop masterpieces as 
"Near You," "Maple Leaf Rag" and "Boogie Woogie" (the Tommy Dorsey version)? 
Still, you had to give Cramer credit for knowing his audience, which reveled in 
every minute of a collection of pieces that lacked only an 800 number to order 
"Piano Versions of the World's Greatest Country Songs." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, traces of the Cramer who was Nashville's first-call studio piano 
player for years burst through the laundry list of standard songs. "Georgia on 
My Mind" received a thoughtful interpretation and "Last Date," Cramer's 1960 
chart-topper, was one of the evening's most appealing numbers. DON HECKMAN

'MASTERPIECE THEATRE' TOUCHES A HURTFUL NERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've all read novels that were difficult to get into but, once in, cast a 
spell that compelled us to the bloody end. That's precisely the case with the 
three-part "Masterpiece Theatre" adaptation of the 1894 Irish novel, "The Real 
Charlotte" (beginning Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, 8 p.m. on 
Channels 40 and 24). 
</P>
<P>
The novel -- a social brew of villagers and tenants and gentry and beggars -- 
was written by two Irish spinster cousins who signed their work Somerville and 
Ross to mask their identities as women (whose real names were Edith Somerville 
and Violet Martin). Their story, as host Alistair Cooke says, "touched a 
hurtful nerve in Irish country life." And the production, shot in Ireland, 
captures the story's grand passions as they creep up on you with a kind of 
bucolic languor. 
</P>
<P>
The entitled character (Jeannane Crowley) is a plain-looking, bossy, scheming 
woman whose malice, unleashed late in the second installment, helps destroy her 
Anna Karenina-like vivacious cousin (Joanna Roth). Nobody kisses the Blarney 
Stone here. "It's as if Thomas Hardy had been dropped into County Cork," 
murmurs host Cooke, whose commentaries create an indispensable context and 
should be required listening (especially his unusual postscript after the final 
episode). 
</P>
<P>
Somerville and Ross weren't writing satire. Their characters, in Bernard 
MacLaverty's teleplay, are largely derisive peasants and aristocrats who debunk 
the myth of Ireland's fanciful past (which was the credo of Ireland's 
high-flown literature of the period). RAY LOYND

HAVES VS. HAVE-NOTS IN 'THE OUTSIDERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Half the budget must have gone for grease. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years after Francis Ford Coppola's movie "The Outsiders" comes his Fox 
television series "The Outsiders," premiering at 9:30 p.m. Sunday, thereafter 
to air at 7 p.m. (Channels 11 and 6). 
</P>
<P>
Like the movie, the series is based on the S.E. Hinton novel about some 
troubled young guys in the 1960s and takes place in a small Oklahoma town where 
the blue-collar greasers and rich-kid socs (pronounced soshes) are in eternal 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The noblest of the greasers are the orphaned Curtis brothers, who face one 
crisis after another in trying to remain together and out of the clutches of 
the welfare agency. Oldest brother Darrell (Boyd Kestner) is the moralizing 
head of the household and main breadwinner. Younger brother Ponyboy (Jay R. 
Ferguson) is the novel-reading literary light. And middle brother Sodapop 
(Rodney Harvey) is a somewhat unpromising work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Darrell's oldest friend, love-making, law-breaking, head-cracking 
Tim Shepherd (Robert Rusler) is also his biggest headache in addition to being 
the greasers' point man for fistfights, staredowns and various other clashes 
with the socs. 
</P>
<P>
Of which there are no more than, oh, half a dozen an episode. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of "The Outsiders" is class conflict -- just about everything is 
defined in those terms -- with the have-nots resenting being exploited and 
patronized by the haves. As a rule, the greasers take the high road on "The 
Outsiders" (Tim excepted) and the socs -- who are a bunch of spoiled snots -- 
the low road. 
</P>
<P>
Although the characters are too inconsistent to be entirely believable and 
often act too inanely to be respected, there are enough nice moments here to 
lift "The Outsiders" above the ordinary and give it promise. Yet "The 
Outsiders" depicts a pretty dismal world, giving us corrupt, sadistic cops and 
rotten rich who spend their waking hours plotting how to oppress the poor and 
dirty-fingernailed. What's more, even the show's young target audience may 
ultimately tire of week after week of greasers and socs sneering and snarling 
at each other. HOWARD ROSENBERG

Photo, VISIONS: Ikebana, the ancient Japanese art of flower arranging, begins 
in the garden with the selection of just the right pieces. Mary B. Taylor Hunt, 
who has been teaching ikebana classes at Huntington Botanical Gardens for more 
than 30 years, gathers branches, then carefully snips them and places them in 
the vase. Her floral arrangements will be part of the San Marino League's 
ikebana show, which continues today from 1 to 4 p.m. in the Ikebana Garden of 
the Huntington's Japanese Garden. Jose Galvez

DAY HIKE: BORREGO PALM CANYON IS CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF STATE'S DESERT SCENERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than half a million acres of Colorado Desert are preserved in Anza-Borrego 
Desert State Park. The state park, California's largest, includes virtually 
every feature associated with a desert -- washes, badlands, mesas and palm 
oases. 
</P>
<P>
The park stretches almost the length of San Diego County's eastern border 
between Riverside County and Mexico. Anza-Borrego Desert State Park's size 
means it is vehicle-oriented. Most of the popular scenic attractions can be 
reached via some semblance of roads. 
</P>
<P>
But to visit a tranquil place like Borrego Palm Canyon, you must hit the trail 
-- a pleasant chore indeed. Borrego Palm Canyon is the third-largest palm oasis 
in California, and was the first site sought for a desert state park back in 
the 1920s. It's a beautiful oasis, tucked away in a rocky V-shaped gorge. 
</P>
<P>
The trail visits the first palm grove and a waterfall. (A longer option takes 
you farther up-canyon.) In springtime, the trail to the falls is one of the 
most popular in the park. During the warmer months, you'll have the oasis all 
to yourself. Watch for bighorn sheep, which frequently visit the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: The trail begins at Borrego Palm Canyon Campground, 
located one mile north of Anza-Borrego State Park Headquarters. Day-use fee is 
$3 per vehicle. Trailhead parking is available at the west end of the 
campground near the campfire circle. 
</P>
<P>
You may park for free at the Visitor Center (one of the best in the whole park 
system and well worth your time) and walk a mile to the trailhead. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: Beginning at the pupfish pond, walk up-canyon past many desert plants 
once used by the Indians for food and shelter. Willow was sought for 
home-building and bow-making; brittle bush and creosote were used for their 
healing qualities; honey, along with mesquite and beavertail cactus, was a food 
staple. Shallow Indian grinding holes can be seen in the granite. 
</P>
<P>
The broad alluvial fan at the mouth of the canyon narrows and the sheer rock 
walls of the canyon soon enclose you as the trail continues along the 
drought-reduced seasonal stream. 
</P>
<P>
If you're already surprised at how an apparently lifeless canyon could provide 
survival ingredients for the Indians, you'll be surprised once more when 
Borrego Palm Oasis comes into view. Just beyond the first group of palms is a 
damp grotto, where a seasonal waterfall (reduced to a mere trickle at last 
report) cascades over huge boulders. The grotto is a popular picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
From the falls, try an alternate trail back to the campground. This trail 
follows the south side of the creek, past magnificent ocotillos, and gives a 
different perspective on this desert environment. 
</P>
<P>
You can also continue hiking up the canyon. The path is more difficult 
up-canyon after the falls, with lots of dense undergrowth and boulders. 
</P>
<P>
To continue to South Fork (where palms, not the Ewings, reside), hike past the 
"tourist turnaround" up the canyon. The canyon is wet, so watch for slippery, 
fallen palm fronds. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon narrows even further and the trail dwindles to nothing. Parallel the 
stream bed and boulder-hop back and forth across the water. The canyon zig-zags 
quite a bit, so you can never see more than a few hundred yards ahead. The hike 
is well-worth the effort, because most of the clusters of palms in the canyon 
are found in the upper reaches. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon splits 1 3/4 miles from the falls. Straight ahead, to the southwest, 
is South Fork. The rocky gorge of South Fork is smothered with bamboo and 
difficult to negotiate. South Fork ascends to the upper slopes of San Ysidro 
Mountain (6,417 feet). 
</P>
<P>
The Middle Fork (the way you came) of Borrego Palm Canyon is dry and more 
passable. It's possible to hike quite a distance first up Middle Fork, then 
North Fork of Borrego Palm Canyon, but check with park rangers first. It's 
extremely rugged terrain. 
</P>

Government troops repelled attacks by ethnic Mon insurgents on a key town in 
southern Myanmar (Burma) after six hours of fighting that killed at least 50 
people, a military spokesman told reporters in Yangon, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said 300 rebels launched simultaneous pre-dawn rocket attacks in 
the town of Ye, about 150 miles east of Yangon, then tried to blow up a key 
railroad bridge. Government troops immediately counterattacked, he said. 
Forty-three Mons, four soldiers and three civilians were reportedly killed. The 
Mons are among nearly a dozen ethnic minority groups fighting for regional 
autonomy and protection for their languages and cultures.

A former Scoutmaster was sentenced Friday to 42 years in prison for molesting 
15 children, most of them Boy Scouts in his troop. 
</P>
<P>
James Buxton, 43, of Wonder Valley, a community outside Twentynine Palms, 
pleaded guilty in February to 18 counts. He will be eligible for parole in 
about 19 years. Buxton was a Scoutmaster in the Morongo Basin area in 
southeastern San Bernardino County. The molestations took place in 1988.

Census takers on Friday went into the fields of northern San Diego County at 
dawn to recount migrant workers, but the effort drew criticism from homeless 
advocates, who said they were "suspicious" of the results because the Census 
Bureau provided no advance notice. Despite the skepticism, census officials 
proclaimed that they now had a "quality count" of the migrants. The Census 
Bureau, acknowledging it had botched the count earlier in the week, said it 
made procedure changes, using more bilingual census takers and retraining 
"enumerators" before embarking on the recount.

<P>
A physician who admitted over-prescribing drugs to a 67-year-old patient before 
her death in 1988 has been put on probation and temporarily banned from 
administering some medicines. Municipal Judge Janice McIntyre-Poe also ordered 
Dr. Peter M. Lewis, 65, to perform 160 hours of community service, to keep 
records of all controlled substances he prescribes and to let another physician 
monitor his prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis pleaded guilty two months ago to over-prescribing drugs to Joan M. 
Culver, 67, wife of retired Riverside Press-Enterprise Co. President Arthur A. 
Culver. In a wrongful-death suit filed against Lewis, the Culver family accused 
him of prescribing 12,560 doses of medication, including phenobarbital, a 
sedative, during the two years before the woman's death. Lewis faces a state 
licensing hearing in August.

FLAVIO CABRAL; POPULAR L.A. MURALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flavio Cabral, a popular Los Angeles artist and muralist in the 1960s, has died 
of heart disease. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura resident died Thursday at Westlake Medical Center, according to a 
spokesman for the Armstrong Family mortuary in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral's work ranged from large murals for public buildings to portraits, and 
from streamlined figures to surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
Former Times art critic Henry J. Seldis praised Cabral's "extremely skillful 
stylizations, which appear nostalgic at first glance (and) project an aura of 
timelessness." Seldis commented that Cabral's "craftsmanship and sense of 
composition deserve wide approval." 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, the Los Angeles City Council purchased Cabral's portrait of the late 
Rufus B. von KleinSmid, former chancellor of USC and president of the city's 
Library Commission, to hang in the Central Library, which is currently under 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
While working as an art instructor at Valley College in 1962, Cabral painted a 
66-foot mural on panels for the library of Fulton Junior High School in Van 
Nuys, where he had previously taught. The mural depicted the evolution of water 
navigation from early Egypt to modern times. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral's work was exhibited by the Stendahl Galleries, the Dalzell Hatfield 
Gallery and the Heritage Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Louise.

CHARGES DISMISSED IN OJAI 'IMPOSTOR' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An alleged con artist who claims to be an innocent 17-year-old teen-ager won 
the first round of his latest legal battle Friday when a Municipal Court judge 
dismissed four felony counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors said they will refile the charges against David Michael Murray, 
31, who is being held without bail in the Ventura County Jail on charges of 
parole violations in California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing on the California parole charge, stemming from a 1980 
auto theft conviction in Ventura, has been set in Ventura Superior Court for 
next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who calls himself Shi Stone and says he is the son of an Air Force 
colonel wounded in the Panama invasion, was cleared Friday of three counts of 
theft by fraud and one of obtaining a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had charged Murray with two counts of defrauding Ken and Dorothy 
Johnson of room and board expenses and $145 in checks used to open a bank 
account and pay for a cooking class and driving instruction fees at an Ojai 
high school, where he enrolled as Shi Stone during a four-week stay with the 
Ojai family. 
</P>
<P>
The other two charges stemmed from claims by a pharmacy owner that he was 
defrauded of a blood coagulant worth $1,600, and that the coagulant was a 
controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons had agreed to be Shi Stone's legal guardians and enroll him in 
school after receiving phone calls from a man who claimed to be an attache at 
the U.S. Embassy in Panama. The alleged impostor was arrested on March 1 after 
school officials became suspicious of his identity. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday's hearing, Dorothy Johnson testified that she had seen her 
husband once give Murray $20 in cash and that she gave Murray $1 every day "to 
buy a soda in school" to complement the packed lunch she prepared every day. 
</P>
<P>
She also said the family spent more than $600 in food and utility bills as a 
result of Murray's stay. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Giser, owner of The Medicine Shoppe, said he agreed to fill Shi Stone's 
prescription in exchange for forthcoming payments from a federal agency, or 
from money that Shi Stone's father would be mailing him from Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas Hutchins ruled that even though Murray might have lied about his 
age, the prosecutor had failed to prove that money was the reason he was 
welcomed into the Johnsons' house. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a colorful story. I haven't heard evidence that he said he was in need 
or had no money," Hutchins said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the alleged prescription drug fraud, Hutchins said, the prosecutor had 
only established that Murray took the medicine, promised to pay for it, and 
still has not. 
</P>
<P>
"That occurs in ordinary commerce every day," Hutchins said. "If that 
constitutes fraud, then every merchant who defaults on a payment would be 
guilty of it too." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacey Ratner moved to dismiss the fourth count of fraud 
after learning that the blood coagulant was not a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
But, the prosecutor said, she was disappointed with Hutchins' decision on the 
other fraud charges. "I think the judge applied a higher standard of proof than 
what is normally required," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratner said she would refile the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who was quoted by police detectives as challenging them to "try to pin 
me with whatever you can" hours after being arrested, remained serious during 
the trial. He never looked at the Johnsons during the trial and was not called 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"He can make all the challenges he wants," Ratner said. "I don't think he's 
going to get away with it."

LEGISLATURE: ASSEMBLYWOMAN SUNNY MOJONNIER OF ENCINITAS AND COLLEAGUES CALL ON 
SERGEANTS-AT-ARMS TO PERFORM AS CHAFFEURS, ERRAND RUNNERS AND VALETS.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Marc Mojonnier can't find a ride home, he doesn't worry. 
</P>
<P>
One call from his mom -- Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier -- and a state-paid 
sergeant-at-arms whisks over to a Sacramento high school to drive the teen-ager 
home in a state car, on taxpayer time. 
</P>
<P>
And, when the Encinitas Republican herself needs a lift after partying at a 
fund-raiser, one sergeant-at-arms plays chauffeur while a second follows in 
Mojonnier's car to make sure it is in her garage for the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trouble-shooters," Mojonnier said of the sergeants-at-arm. 
</P>
<P>
But critics have long claimed that Mojonnier and some of her colleagues are 
abusing their privilege by turning the sergeants-at-arms into high-priced 
personal servants. A review of 1989 legislative logs by United Press 
International and The Times shows that lawmakers such as Mojonnier continue to 
call on the 80 sergeants-at-arms and chauffeurs to perform such tasks as 
picking up laundry, standing in line at the bank, turning off kitchen 
appliances and making sure there is enough cat food in the house. 
</P>
<P>
The more visible tasks for the sergeants, who are given badges and cost 
taxpayers more than $2 million a year, are to provide security for lawmakers 
and keep order during legislative floor and committee sessions. They shush a 
noisy crowd, carry notes to legislators during committee hearings and screen 
visitors to the Assembly and Senate floors. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, legislators began using sergeants for transportation to 
the airport. Since then, their duties have multiplied to the point that they 
perform even the smallest tasks at the whim of lawmakers, records show. 
Newspaper stories have revealed that the sergeants-at-arms have been used to 
fetch a legislator's birth-control pills, as well as to buy live mice for a 
prominent Assembly member's pet boa constrictor. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that they're there to accommodate the legislators and their time 
constraints," said Bob Connelly, chief administrative officer of the Assembly 
Rules Committee. Any task is deemed to have a legislative benefit, he said, "if 
it saves a member time or assists them in performing a function." 
</P>
<P>
However, Danny Lynch, a former Assembly sergeant who quit to become a private 
investigator, told UPI last week that the job has become nothing more than "a 
glorified bellboy position." 
</P>
<P>
"You go under the pretense of being a peace officer, and you get a badge, but 
it pretty much stops there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the possibilities for abuse, the Senate has tried to rein its use of 
sergeants, but the Assembly allows wide discretion. The sergeants themselves 
are told to remain quiet about legislative requests, a policy that continues 
even after some leave their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I picked up a girlfriend one day and a wife the next, 
and I just kept a straight face," former sergeant Lydia Sims told UPI. Sims 
recently received a $95,500 settlement in her sexual harassment lawsuit against 
the Assembly and her former supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The review of last year's logs reveals a number of instances in which Mojonnier 
and other lawmakers used the sergeants in a manner more befitting the Morgan 
Freeman character in the movie "Driving Miss Daisy." The review shows: 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier routinely uses sergeants-at-arms, calling on them at least 62 times 
last year to pick her up at home, drive her cars, chauffeur her children, haul 
wine from her car to her office and make sure she got home safely from evening 
excursions. She called on sergeants to drop off or pick up her son 22 times 
from classes at Kennedy High School, about 7 miles south of the Capitol. One 
notation shows that a sergeant took the teen-ager home from school, then drove 
him to the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier also acknowledged that she once sent a sergeant to Nevada City to 
deliver a sleeping bag, blankets and snacks to her son, Marc, who at the time 
was enrolled in a private school there. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) called on the sergeants last November to 
drive his wife from their Placerville home, 40 miles outside of Sacramento, to 
the San Francisco airport to greet their son. Chacon at the time was stuck in 
San Diego, where his flight to Sacramento was delayed two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland) sent a sergeant to his home to turn off 
his crock pot and put it in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblymen Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) and 
other legislators hitched rides to the Capital Athletic Club, only 4 blocks 
from their offices. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco, Mojonnier, and a host of other legislators routinely use sergeants to 
drive them to restaurants only one or two blocks from the Capitol. 
Assemblywoman Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon) once had a sergeant drive her to 
Weinstock's department store, just two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than drive himself to his Santa Clara home on weekends, Assemblyman John 
Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) has a sergeant drive his convertible so he can 
rest or read. Another sergeant-at-arms follows in a second car to take the 
first driver back to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) had cat food delivered to his home and office. 
Sergeants-at-arms told UPI that Robbins once asked that his cat be brought to 
the office, but the request was refused. 
</P>
<P>
Other jobs for sergeants have included taking lawmakers or their children to 
ballgames, movies and rock concerts. They have also fetched prescriptions from 
nearby drugstores, purchased underwear, carried out household garbage and moved 
furniture into lawmakers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators such as Mojonnier say having the sergeants perform these tasks is 
important because it saves time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working 12, 15, 18 hours a day," Mojonnier said this week. "Everybody 
suffers. Our families suffer. These are things you do. . . . The workload is 
such that it's not out of line." 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier said that, as a single mother, the use of the sergeants is 
particularly crucial in tending to her son, Marc. Most of the time, she said, 
he rides to and from school with friends, but there are occasions when he is 
left stranded and she can't get away from the public's business. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people in the private sector who use their staffs to do these 
things," she said. "Working mothers are the ones who are going to use it more." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case more than a year ago when, Mojonnier said, her son, Marc, 
then attending a private school in Nevada City, called during a cold snap. "I 
didn't realize it was so cold, and he called and said he was freezing," 
Mojonnier recalled. "He needed to have a sleeping bag and blankets brought up 
to him, so I sent some blankets up and some food." 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier said there is another reason for calling on sergeants-at-arms after 
hours: "In this state, you have laws that you don't drink and drive, and there 
are a lot of different functions" that legislators attend. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that it took two sergeants to help Mojonnier home on the evening 
of Feb. 15, 1989. One picked her up at the Hyatt Regency hotel -- right across 
from the Capitol and the site of many receptions -- and drove her home at 11:49 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, a second sergeant drove Mojonnier's car to her south 
Sacramento residence, the records show. 
</P>
<P>
On July 17, Mojonnier kept the sergeants hopping. A sergeant took her home at 
5:45 p.m., then, at 6:06 p.m., drove her to Ricci's, an Italian restaurant and 
bar near downtown. At 7:58 p.m., another sergeant picked Mojonnier up at the 
restaurant and drove her to an outdoor theater, Music Circus, where she watched 
a performance. A sergeant returned to pick her up at 10:18 but had to return at 
11:10 p.m. because the "member (was) not ready," according to the logs. 
</P>
<P>
While lawmakers intone the merits of ride-sharing to the public, they often 
have separate cars pick them up at the airport, even if they are on the same 
flight, or their arrivals are only a few minutes apart. 
</P>
<P>
On the Senate side, UPI reported that logs show Robbins regularly using 
sergeants-at-arms to carry his boots to be shined on the first floor of the 
Capitol, to carry personal and campaign letters to a secretarial service and to 
ferry his girlfriends to the airport, where the sergeants also retrieve the 
tofu he has delivered by plane. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins also called on sergeants to fetch cat food, a notation in the logs that 
he disputes. The legislator said the errand was actually to retrieve an 
antibiotic for Daisy, a 6-year-old office cat that was suffering from a 
digestive ailment. Robbins said he paid the Senate Rules Committee $1,260 in 
the last year to cover the cost of personal services provided by the sergeants. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins told The Times that his use of the sergeant-at-arms was "appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly would never want to tell the people of the San Fernando Valley 
that some Valley park measure or transit measure . . . lost because I was away 
from the Capitol running a personal errand, picking up medication for my cat or 
something similar."

PEARCE RECEIVES LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: TWO JURORS HAD FAVORED DEATH IN THE GAS CHAMBER. BUT, AFTER HAMMERING 
IT OUT, SYMPATHY FOR THE FORMER TEACHER'S AIDE, WHO WAS CONVICTED OF HIRING TWO 
TEEN-AGERS TO KILL HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND, WON OUT. 
</P>

<P>
A Vista Superior Court jury decided Friday that Roberta Pearce deserved 
sympathy and spared her from the gas chamber for hiring two teen-age boys to 
murder her estranged husband. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of death, the 42-year-old former Escondido teacher's aide was sentenced 
to life behind bars without parole for the crime that involved sex, drugs, a 
kitchen knife and a carpenter's hand ax. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour of deliberations, the jury was deadlocked, 10-2 in favor of life 
in prison, but after Judge Franklin Mitchell Jr. ordered them to try again, 
jurors debated for two more hours and emerged to announce a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Harold Pinaire of Oceanside said afterward that it took some convincing 
to sway the two women jurors who wanted Pearce's death. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't see the good in Roberta Pearce, we had to keep hammering away," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the brutal death of Wayne Pearce, who was stabbed and hacked 23 times 
on Jan. 31, 1989, Pinaire said the jury was moved to compassion by the sad 
events in Pearce's life leading up to her husband's killing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrendous," Pinaire said. "He walked out on her for another woman. She 
wasn't going to have any children. She thought she might have had breast 
cancer. I know it had to play something on her mind." 
</P>
<P>
Pearce was expressionless as the sentence was read to the court, just as she 
was on March 12 when she was convicted of first-degree murder. She showed no 
sign of relief that the death penalty wasn't imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Her brother, Haskell Meadows, later said "she cannot understand how she was 
found guilty" to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
Though he said she was bearing up under the strain, "She's scared because she's 
going to be going to prison. She said she's heard there's a lot of fights in 
jail." 
</P>
<P>
However, the legal saga of Roberta Pearce might not be finished. 
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to appear again before Mitchell for formal sentencing May 11, 
and her co-defense counsel, Brad Patton, indicated that he will probably file 
motions for a new trial. He declined to say on what basis. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Department G, so humid that a small floor fan was pointed toward 
the jury box, is a place far from the reality of most of Pearce's 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
She was raised in a middle-class, devout Christian family in a tiny Tennessee 
town, married at age 16, and bore two daughters before a divorce from her first 
husband in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she married Wayne Pearce and wound up in North County, where she 
was a teacher's aide at Orange Glen High School in Escondido. There, she made 
some devoted friends among the faculty, who remembered her in courtroom 
testimony as caring for difficult students, loving her pets, and desperately 
wanting a baby with Wayne Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
After 41 years of an ordinary life and 14 1/2 years of marriage to Pearce, her 
world crumbled. He left her for a younger woman and she lapsed into a tawdry 
life. A 16-year-old girl, Mandy Gardiser, became her housemate, and soon, 
Pearce's ranch house in Valley Center attracted other youths. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony, she admitted smoking marijuana with the youths and to having 
sexual relations with one teen-age boy, Frank Rodriguez. The prosecution 
claimed she hatched a scheme for two other boys, Isaac Hill and Anthony Pilato, 
then 15, to kill her husband in exchange for each receiving a car and part of 
Pearce's benefits from her husband's $200,000 life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Pilato ambushed and mortally wounded Pearce with a knife from Roberta 
Pearce's kitchen and a carpenter's hand ax as he left for work. They were found 
guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to the California Youth Authority 
until they reach age 25. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder for 
his role. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce's murder conviction carried special circumstances -- murder for 
financial gain and lying in wait -- which set her penalty at either death or 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
All this week, jurors heard testimony. They heard sometimes emotional pleas to 
spare Pearce because she had led a good life until she crumbled when her 
husband destroyed their marriage and her chance for a child. The defense also 
claimed the murder plot was invented and perpetrated by the youths. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tim Casserly, argued that her crime was so 
cold and calculated -- hiring teen-agers and being angry with them when Wayne 
Pearce didn't die immediately -- that only death was the right penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Even after jurors decided on life in prison for Pearce, Casserly insisted the 
crime merited the ultimate penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't be advocating a position we didn't think was appropriate," he 
said. "They voted for life and we accept that." He wasn't certain in which 
state prison Pearce would serve her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But juror Pinaire said the panel felt that despite the crime, her teaching 
skills could still be useful to society, which helped make her worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Roberta Pearce can do something for the prisoners or even society 
itself, even though she's confined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the two jurors who initially voted for the death penalty are women, 
"which was a surprise to me. I kind of figured they'd be more sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
The jury was composed of seven women and five men, most of whom declined to be 
interviewed after sentencing. Said one woman, "It's done, it's over with. 
That's it." 
</P>
<P>
For Pearce's family, that may not be it. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Herbert Meadows, said, "We kept telling her don't give up hope, 
we'll have an appeal."

REPORT BACKS SHRINKING BORDERS OF PORT DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
BOUNDARIES: THE OXNARD PORT DISTRICT, WHICH IS SEEKING TO EXPAND COUNTYWIDE, 
SHOULD INCLUDE ONLY OXNARD AND PORT HEUNEME, LAFCO SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The boundaries of the Oxnard Port District should be shrunk to include only the 
cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme and their unincorporated areas, according to 
a staff report released Friday by the Local Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The district now includes Camarillo and parts of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The report supports proposals made by the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, 
but directly contradicts a proposal by the Oxnard Port District, which wants to 
expand its borders countywide. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO commissioners, who decide matters of annexations for cities and special 
districts, are scheduled to rule on the recommendation after a public hearing 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Shrinking the district, for which the boundaries were set in 1937, could allow 
the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme to raid district funds, diverting them 
into city coffers, Edward Millan, district board president, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's phase one of a plan," Millan said. "Phase two would be to dissolve the 
district and make the port a department of the cities" of Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"The cities would then gain access to the district funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Braitman, executive director of LAFCO, disagreed. Laws are in place 
to prevent cities from spending port district funds on anything other than 
port-related business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe this is an effort to balance the cities' budgets on the back 
of the port district," Braitman said. 
</P>
<P>
At stake, port officials say, is their effort to expand the activities at the 
Port of Hueneme, which the district operates. Without the increased prestige of 
a countywide district, their efforts to make the waterway a U.S. port of entry 
would be jeopardized, they say. 
</P>
<P>
The upgraded status would bring increased business and revenue to the port and 
the county, port officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
Braitman, however, argued that the residents of Oxnard and Port Hueneme -- who 
bear most of the brunt of truck traffic to and from the deep-sea port -- would 
be better served by a smaller district. According to the staff report, trucks 
make trips to or from the port an average of 286 times per day. 
</P>
<P>
If the two cities were the only ones included in district boundaries, their 
voters would decide issues such as port expansion, he said. If the district 
were countywide, voters who live 30 miles away from the port would decide on 
issues that affect Oxnard and Port Hueneme, Braitman said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's report was the most recent in a series of maneuvers by the district, 
the cities and LAFCO. In August, Oxnard and Port Hueneme proposed that other 
cities be excluded from the district. To counter that proposal, port district 
directors proposed that the boundaries be enlarged to include the entire 
county. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, LAFCO supported a proposal for countywide boundaries. But information 
provided by Oxnard and Port Hueneme -- as well as Fillmore, Ojai and Santa 
Paula, which opposed the expansion -- changed Braitman's mind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Port of Hueneme's two main shipments are bananas and cars, and it serves as 
a main terminal for most offshore oil activities. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding the boundaries would bring no additional revenue to the district 
because it does not collect property taxes, although that is within its 
jurisdiction, Braitman said. It derives fees paid by ships that unload cargo at 
the port. 
</P>
<P>
The port has a $26-million payroll and generates $143 million for the county's 
economy, according to the staff report. Eighty percent of the money generated 
by the port directly benefits the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, according 
to a 1989 study commissioned by the two cities.

PICTURESQUE SCHOONERS TO HOIST SAILS IN RACES FOR MUSEUM'S BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Landlubbers who associate schooners with large glasses of beer might be 
disappointed, but San Diegans who link schooners with sailing will be smiling 
this weekend and next as San Diego turns into the schooner capital of North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
The first of several schooner-only races will begin at 11 a.m. today outside 
Oceanside Harbor, when 18 of the ships glide down the San Diego County coast to 
a finish line off of Mission Bay. The Downwind Classic Schooner Race, part of 
the San Diego Spring Schooner Festival, which takes place this weekend, will 
benefit the San Diego Maritime Museum Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The schooner fleet will rest on Saturday and return to racing Sunday, meeting 
off the Mission Bay Channel entrance for a 1 p.m. start. The Billy Bones 
Traditional Schooner Race will end at a finish line in San Diego Bay. Proceeds, 
again, will go to the San Diego Maritime Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those 18 boats -- as well as six or seven additional schooners -- will 
race again March 31 and April 1 in the America's Schooner Cup race hosted by 
the Kona Kai Yacht Club. Next weekend's races will benefit the Navy Relief 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kona Kai races will be very spectator-friendly," said Joe Ditler, one of 
the organizers of the races. "You can see them from Shelter Island, Harbor 
Island, all around the bay." 
</P>
<P>
Schooners, picturesque boats that now carry mainly passengers on charter 
outings, once played an integral role in the West Coast's sailing fleet, 
according to Ditler, whose Coronado-based media promotions firm is known as 
"Schooner or Later." 
</P>
<P>
"Old pictures from the 1800s showed San Diego Harbor filled with schooners," 
Ditler said. "They carried everything you could imagine." Schooners were 
preferred to other types of sailboats because they were fast and, unlike 
square-rigged sailboats, they could easily sail both up and down California's 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Square riggers would come around and land in San Francisco, and you could sail 
them down the coast in a fast reach," Ditler said. "But, because of their 
square sails, they couldn't go back upwind. They'd have to ride out half way to 
Hawaii and come back in, which is a long and not very practical route." 
</P>
<P>
"The vogue thing to do is refurbish old schooners or build new ones from old 
designs," Ditler said. "They're a complicated ship, they have a lot of canvas 
and they take a large crew to sail." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is home to about 15 schooners, each of which has "a long, interesting 
history," Ditler said. Although the schooner design originated in Holland in 
the 1600s, American designers refined the boats during the late 1800s and early 
1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Two local schooners, Bagheera and Dauntless, were designed by John Alden, who 
"was to yacht designs what Porsche was to automobile racing," Ditler said. "He 
designed many successful boats."

SILBERMAN JUDGE REJECTS BID TO DISMISS CASE BECAUSE OF INFORMANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Friday rejected a claim by Richard T. Silberman's lawyers that 
FBI agents committed a grave error in building the money-laundering case 
against the prominent San Diego businessman by using an informant with a 
purportedly lengthy history of violence. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving refused to dismiss the charges against 
Silberman because of the use of the informant, Robert Benjamin, even though 
defense attorneys had argued that the practice involved "outrageous" government 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Irving also refused to order prosecutors and FBI agents to turn over to defense 
lawyers any more information on Benjamin or to hold a special hearing on the 
defense contentions, the judge's law clerk said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Irving's ruling marked the latest in a series of decisions he has issued over 
the past month rejecting every significant pretrial defense effort to strike 
any of the seven counts against Silberman, who served as a top aide to 
then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and three other men are accused of 
laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent allegedly characterized as the 
proceeds of Colombian drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman is scheduled to stand trial alone April 25. Petti and the three 
others are scheduled to be tried July 17. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing this week, Silberman's San Francisco-based defense attorneys had 
argued that Benjamin, the government's key informant in the case, has such a 
lengthy history of threats and violence that the case had to be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, lawyer James J. Brosnahan said Benjamin's record of violence 
dates to 1969, called him "psychotic, schizophrenic (and) dangerous" and 
claimed it was a gross error to use him against Silberman, who has no criminal 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder, the lead prosecutor in the case, said 
at the hearing that Brosnahan's allegations were largely "wild allegations" 
that were based on claims from Benjamin's ex-wife and stepson. Prosecutors 
believe that neither is particularly credible, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
It was through Benjamin, a convicted felon who had become a cooperating witness 
for the FBI, that Silberman met the undercover FBI agent, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said at the hearing that he was not prepared to rule at the time because 
both Brosnahan and Gorder had given him new material about Benjamin to review. 
On Friday, Irving called both lawyers and informally told them he was rejecting 
the defense contentions, adding that he would file a formal written order 
later, the judge's law clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk did not elaborate on the reasons behind the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan declined to comment on Irving's ruling. Gorder could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
With the primary defense pretrial motions concluded, the next major hearing in 
the case is set for April 10: a defense request to move the trial to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys contend that Silberman cannot get a fair trial in San Diego 
because there has been so much publicity about the case since he was arrested 
last April 7 in a Mission Bay hotel room.

TEACHERS OFFER NEW CONTRACT PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School trustees in Santa Paula Friday were studying a new teachers' proposal 
designed to end an impasse in contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
A representative for teachers in the Santa Paula Elementary School District 
declined to reveal the proposal's contents. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers had at first demanded an 8.03% increase in wages. The district had 
countered with 5.03%. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute grew hotter this week as teachers refused to perform any 
extracurricular duties for which they are not specifically paid. Parents 
stepped in to help prepare for a Science Fair scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. David Phillips said the tactic has had little impact on the district. But 
Ken Kleveland, vice president of the Santa Paula Federation of Teachers, said 
the slowdown has been effective in pressuring the district. 
</P>
<P>
After submitting the new offer Thursday night, Kleveland said Friday that he 
believes a strike may be inevitable. The teachers' current three-year contract 
expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The board first wage increase offer of 5.03% was retroactive to Sept. 1, 1989, 
costing a total of $376,666 for 144 teachers. The teachers' federation asked 
for 8.03%, retroactive only to Jan. 1, a proposal that was rejected by the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Of major concern to the teachers is how their wages compare to those of 
teachers in other county districts, Kleveland said. Newly hired teachers, who 
start at $20,120, make an average of $1,000 more a year than their county 
peers. Those who have worked in the district for five years receive $800 more, 
but 10-year veterans receive $500 less. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-year veteran teachers are paid $1,200 less a year than their peers 
elsewhere in the county, Kleveland said. The scale tops out at $39,936 for 
those who have received all step increases. EMELIA CHAFFEE

AUDIT CLEARS MANAGERS OF DEAF CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An audit begun after the forced resignation of the director of CSUN's National 
Center on Deafness has found that the center's financial difficulties were 
caused by overstaffing and an increase in students' demands for services. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge administrators said the audit found no misappropriation of 
funds or intentional mismanagement of the center's $1.2-million 1989-90 budget, 
which was nearly exhausted by February, four months early. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very complicated set of circumstances," said Bob Suzuki, vice 
president for academic affairs. "Things were not well looked after." 
</P>
<P>
An internal audit, expected to be completed next week, calls for cutting 
clerical and student positions from the center in an effort to keep the center 
financially solvent through the end of the semester. Even so, Suzuki said, CSUN 
will have to spend about $50,000 to subsidize interpreting services, which help 
deaf students attend regular CSUN classes. 
</P>
<P>
The director of the deaf services center, Victor H. Galloway, resigned March 6 
after administrators accused him of mismanaging center funds. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway has acknowledged that expenditures got out of control, primarily 
because the number of students, as well as their needs and demands for 
interpreters, mushroomed this year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the additional interpreter costs, Suzuki said, the center became 
slightly top-heavy in clerical and professional positions after moving into a 
new, $2.7-million building a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They had just moved into a new building, they had a lot of space," he said. "I 
think they began to think very expansively. I think there were a lot of good 
intentions about trying to expand the scope and all of that, but unfortunately 
they didn't have sufficient funds to expand that far." 
</P>
<P>
To cut costs, CSUN administrators plan to transfer at least one and possibly 
two center secretaries to other areas of the college, Suzuki said. The center 
will save about $5,000 by farming its work study students out to other 
departments. Center travel accounts have been frozen and supply purchases will 
be cut back. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, administrators will try to solicit additional funds from the 
federal and state government to run the center in the future, he said. One 
proposal is to tie the center's budget to the number of students enrolled 
there.

STUDENTS STUDY BIAS AND THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tamika Westfield, a black teen-ager at Canyon High School, recalled with 
exasperation a question by fellow students at the predominantly white campus in 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
"People asked me if I was in a gang because I wore a Raiders jacket," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students around her laughed, shaking their heads and rolling their eyes in 
disbelief. But other students nodded knowingly. It's hard to wear black and not 
be called a gang member, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Westfield and 99 other Canyon students shared other stories of insensitive 
remarks, double standards, sexism, stereotypes and blatant bigotry during a 
daylong seminar Friday designed to promote cultural understanding at the high 
school. By day's end students drafted a plan to promote racial harmony on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes funny, sometimes eerily moving, the seminar forced students to 
evaluate how they view and behave toward others unlike themselves. The ethnic 
composition of the campus is changing, said social science teacher Julia 
Howelman, and school officials hope the seminar will help prevent ethnic 
conflicts from erupting in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's do something before it happens," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With a minority population of 21.4%, Canyon High is the most culturally diverse 
campus in the William S. Hart Union High School District, said English teacher 
Jody Monteleone. The percentage of minority students is small compared to the 
inner city, but the campus is a rare common ground for different races in the 
predominantly white Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The demographics of the valley, however, are slowly changing. Ten years ago, 
one of every 300 students at Canyon was black, Howelman said. Today, one of 
every 40 is black. One out of every six students is Latino, almost twice the 
ratio of 10 years ago, Howelman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 students were nominated by teachers to attend the seminar, which 
included group discussions, videotapes on racism and stereotypes, and a somber 
speech by David Okasaki, a teacher from Saugus High School who told how his 
parents were imprisoned in an internment camp for Japanese-Americans during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in a concentration camp," he began, "an American concentration 
camp." The room, earlier that morning filled with laughter when students 
discussed the moral implications of ethnic jokes, fell silent as students 
listened to Okasaki describe how the memories and shame of the camps scarred 
his parents' lives and his. 
</P>
<P>
"As I grew up, I didn't like who I was," he said. "I didn't like being 
Japanese." He and his family had to prove they were Americans after the camp, 
he said. His voice tinged with regret, he said he never learned to speak 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
During a group discussion, some students complained that some teachers 
occasionally make ethnic jokes. The teachers recently attended a seminar 
similar to Friday's program, and Monteleone said she hoped that session had 
influenced the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"If your teachers have been telling ethnic jokes in class, I hope that's 
stopped," she said. "If your teachers are doing that in class, if you are 
offended, I hope you tell them." 
</P>
<P>
Students confronted their own prejudices as well. "I'm not that prejudiced -- 
only gays," said James Brimidge, 18, a senior. "That's the only thing." 
</P>
<P>
Brimidge, who is black, also complained that he, like Westfield, had been 
judged by his clothes and the color of his skin. "The way I dress is different, 
and they immediately thought I was in a gang," he said of other students. 
</P>
<P>
Howelman conceded that "we have a real gang fear up here." Some parents 
recently asked school officials if Canyon had gang problems because Latino 
students were gathering in front of the school to socialize, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very much aware that this community does have prejudices that you've 
gotten from your parents and other adults," Howelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, maybe we should start teaching parents," said John Bibi, 17, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something you guys can do," Howelman replied.

LAWYERS REPORTEDLY TOLD OF PROBABLE INDICTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
LETTERS: FEDERAL PROSECUTORS NOTIFY 15 TO 20 ATTORNEYS AND ASSOCIATES, OFFERING 
THEM A CHANCE TO MEET WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS BEFORE AN INDICTMENT IS 
HANDED DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About 15 to 20 Los Angeles-area lawyers and their associates have been informed 
by federal prosecutors that they are likely to be indicted on racketeering 
charges stemming from an elaborate insurance fraud, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Letters sent Thursday and Friday by the U.S. attorney in San Diego offered the 
lawyers and others a chance to meet with Justice Department officials in 
Washington on April 2 or April 3, before an indictment is handed down. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. George D. Hardy acknowledged that the letters had been 
sent but declined to give further details. "All I want to confirm is letters 
went out to different individuals, giving them an opportunity to meet with 
officials in the Department of Justice, and that's all," Hardy said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Another source close to the case expressed concern about the letters becoming 
public, saying, "It clearly wasn't intended to be known." 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, four lawyers and three other people have pleaded guilty 
to mail fraud in the case, involving a group of Los Angeles-area lawyers whom 
prosecutors have called the "Alliance." Two other attorneys have been indicted 
on charges of lying to a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
But the letters suggest that the massive indictment long expected in the case 
may be close at hand. Rumors have circulated since last fall that as many as 20 
more attorneys and their associates might be indicted under the federal 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, leading legal experts to 
say the case may emerge as one of the largest prosecutions of attorneys in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The act, known as the RICO law was meant to be used to prosecute organized 
crime, but also has been used extensively in drug and white-collar crime cases 
that involve a pattern of criminal activity. In RICO cases, the government has 
sweeping powers to freeze suspects' assets before trial. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department policy affords RICO targets a pre-indictment hearing with 
the department's organized crime and racketeering section, in which the 
suspects can explain why they should not be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Juanita Brooks, a lawyer for attorney Lynn B. Stites, whom prosecutors had 
previously identified as the key target in the case, declined to say whether 
Stites had received a letter. 
</P>
<P>
A San Fernando Valley attorney said in the past to be a target told The Times 
on Friday that he had not received a letter. "Maybe that's a good sign," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Alliance case involves a network of lawyers who allegedly conspired to 
manipulate complex civil cases to extract huge defense fees from insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers, most of them sole practitioners or members of small law firms in 
the Valley, West Los Angeles or Beverly Hills, appeared together in a number of 
complex civil litigations in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties from 
about 1985 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, insurance companies and those who have already 
pleaded guilty in the case, the lawyers sometimes paid kickbacks to their 
clients for the right to defend them at insurance company expense. 
</P>
<P>
They allegedly performed exhaustive and needless pretrial discovery work to run 
up defense bills, and filed baseless cross-claims, or secondary lawsuits, 
against one another's clients, to increase each attorney's workload and fees. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, both defense and plaintiffs' attorneys purportedly were Alliance 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers helped draft the lawsuits filed against their clients, 
taking care to include precise language from insurance policies that would 
require insurers to pay defense costs. 
</P>
<P>
According to some estimates, the lawyers may have billed insurers as much as 
$200 million, but it is uncertain how much of that may have been unnecessary or 
fraudulent.

EXXON TO HIRE 600 TO BUILD OIL FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Exxon Co. USA will hire 600 workers, many from Ventura County, to build new 
onshore and offshore oil-processing facilities in Santa Barbara, the company 
announced Friday from its Thousand Oaks production office. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Contractors Assn. applauded the announcement as a 
much-needed boost to the county building industry, which says that there have 
been fewer local projects because of growth controls in cities throughout the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"That will have a very positive effect on our industry," said Steve Blois, a 
Ventura contractor who is association president. 
</P>
<P>
The distance from Ventura to Santa Barbara is no deterrent for construction 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Work's work. They'll drive," Blois said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the project, now in its second phase of development, is 
expected to begin this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon signed a subcontract agreement Friday with Ebasco Constructors of Santa 
Ana, which agreed to hire most workers from Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis 
Obispo counties. Because Ventura has far more construction workers than the 
other two counties, the force will come predominantly from Ventura, Exxon 
spokesman Brian Dunphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has already completed one phase of construction on the project, which 
includes two new offshore platforms and a gasoline- and oil-processing plant 
onshore. The onshore facilities, where the 600 will be employed, will be about 
20 miles west of Santa Barbara in Las Flores Canyon, between Refugio State 
Beach and El Capitan Ranch Park. 
</P>
<P>
The two platforms, named Harmony and Heritage, will be farther north and 
farther out to sea than Hondo, Exxon's only operating platform in the Santa 
Barbara Channel. Their metal frames are in the water now, and their upper level 
decks will be constructed in Texas and shipped next year. 
</P>
<P>
Dunphy said the two platforms and the processing plant should be operational by 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
However, before the first oil is pumped, the project will be subject to 
scrutiny by Santa Barbara County officials, who will ensure its compliance with 
county permit restrictions. JOANNA M. MILLER

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ex-convict wanted in connection with a narcotics violation was arrested 
Thursday in Ocean Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fred R. Griffith, 29, was arrested at 7:30 a.m. at a motel in the 5000 block of 
West Point Loma Boulevard, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
He said Griffith had 43 doses of LSD in his possession and is being held in 
lieu of $8,000 bail at County Jail on suspicion of being an ex-convict in 
possession of a gun and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Stephens, 32, was also arrested at the motel on suspicion of credit 
card theft. He is being held in lieu of $53,000 bail on suspicion of 10 counts 
of burglary, 10 counts of forgery and drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens had two credit cards that belonged to residents of Rancho Santa Fe and 
Las Cruces, N.M., Robinson said, adding that the credit card owners had 
reported the cards missing March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Paxton found a new bicycle, a police scanner, radar detector and other 
equipment worth $15,000, in the motel room, Robinson said. Police are 
investigating.

BURNING BODY OF BOY FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified boy, about 7 years old, was apparently killed and set afire in 
the Santa Susana Knolls area south of Simi Valley, the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's body was found by Ventura County firefighters who were trying to 
extinguish a brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that a flammable liquid had been poured on the body and ignited, 
Lt. Kathy Kemp said. A pair of handcuffs was found near the body and may have 
been used on the boy before the fire, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was between 6 and 8 years old, Kemp said. Investigators from the 
Ventura County medical examiner's office were unable to identify the boy. He 
was described as white with brown hair, wearing a T-shirt, shorts, socks and 
tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
An intensive search of the area with the help of two Sheriff's Department 
helicopters failed to turn up any suspects, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities found the body after two motorists reported a brush fire near Black 
Canyon Road south of Santa Susana Pass Road about 11:50 a.m., Kemp said.

APARTMENT CONVERSION ANGERS TENANTS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: UNITS WERE LEASED BARELY TWO WEEKS BEFORE EVICTION NOTICES WERE POSTED 
BECAUSE OF A PLANNED CHANGE TO CONDOMINIUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Tenants of a Van Nuys apartment building are angry over a sudden decision by 
their landlord to move them out and auction off their 49 units as condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the tenants of the Cabrito Park Condominiums, which have been rented 
for the past six years as apartments despite the building's name, live paycheck 
to paycheck and have little money for security deposits and other expenses. 
Others are elderly or physically disabled and some say they were allowed to 
move in by the building's management only weeks before eviction notices were 
posted without warning March 16. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Lardner, the building's manager who is also a part owner of the property, 
said he and his partner have given the tenants more advance notice of the 
evictions than is required by law and have assured tenants in writing that they 
will get their security deposits back. 
</P>
<P>
But tenants such as Mary Ann Emmons, 26, say such explanations are little 
comfort. Emmons, who is six months pregnant, said she moved into the building 
in February so she could relax when her baby came. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford anything more than $800 a month for rent," she said, adding 
that she has made several unsuccessful inquiries about other similarly priced 
apartments since the eviction postings. "That's why this place was so 
appealing." 
</P>
<P>
Lois Sotello, who helped organize two tenant meetings this past week to discuss 
the 45-day eviction notices, said the group wants the building's owners to give 
them more time to move, to pay their relocation expenses and to return security 
deposits to tenants before they move out. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 of the tenants met for a second time on Wednesday in an effort to 
resolve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to move out, but they have to work with us," said Sotello, 
referring to the owners of the building in the 8000 block of Langdon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Lardner said the building has been losing more than $100,000 annually, while 
the owners tried to sell the whole building. He said he decided only earlier 
this month to auction the units off as condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"I have told them that we will work with them in any way possible," Lardner 
said. "I don't know what these people want." 
</P>
<P>
E. H. Schultz, a co-owner of the building, acknowledged that new tenants should 
not have been allowed to move in as late as early March. But he blamed a 
miscommunication between Lardner and the on-site manager for the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"If she rented some apartments on March 1, then that was a mistake," Schultz 
said, referring to the on-site manager. "Those units should not have been 
rented." 
</P>
<P>
Pamela L. Brown, an attorney with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal 
Services, said the building's owners have complied with the law by giving the 
tenants at least 30 days notice of an eviction and by promising to return 
security deposits within 14 days after they are forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the need to quickly find an apartment has been unsettling for the 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Blanche Johnston, 87, who only moved to Cabrito Park in January, barely scrapes 
by financially and is unable to move to a new apartment without assistance. "I 
just don't know what I'm going to do," she said. "I get Social Security and a 
small pension . . . but I have expensive medication, insurance and I'm 
disabled. I don't have the money to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Steele, a tenant who also helped organize Wednesday's meeting, said 
the evictions are part of a larger problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand where homeless people come from now," he said. "This guy might be 
within his legal rights, but I don't think he handled the situation very well."

FIREFIGHTERS GET COURSE IN STUNT SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The subject was maiming, shooting, electrocuting, exploding and incinerating 
the human body. 
</P>
<P>
The script was filled with hits and squibs, mortars, blanks, soft grain caps 
and blood bags. 
</P>
<P>
The theme, odd as it may seem, was safety. 
</P>
<P>
For about 50 Glendale firefighters assembled on temporary bleachers behind a 
movie studio in south Glendale on Friday afternoon, it was probably the most 
engaging two hours of formal instruction they've ever sat through. 
</P>
<P>
One of them even got splattered on the forehead with a blood-soaked plug of wax 
that was shot from a blowgun. In Hollywood, that's a "head hit." 
</P>
<P>
The exercise was part of an eight-hour course all Glendale firefighters will be 
taking during the weekend, covering just about everything the movie industry 
does that could be a real-life threat to life and limb. The curriculum was 
designed by the state fire marshall to improve the supervision of studio and 
location shooting by fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
Even as instruction was under way Friday, State Fire Marshall James McMullen 
awarded a plaque to Glendale Fire Chief John M. Montenero, honoring Glendale as 
the first city in California to put all its personnel through the course. 
</P>
<P>
Though hardly the movie capital of the world, Glendale has its own share of the 
action. The course was being offered at the Glendale Studios on South Glendale 
Avenue, where the game show "Jackpot" was shot earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The city also hosts up to four or five location shoots a week, which interest 
the department because they use such equipment as 1,000-watt lamps, mobile 
generators, fueling trucks and high-tech vehicles, like a camera boom truck 
that can go 85 m.p.h., with four-wheel electric power and six-wheel steering. 
</P>
<P>
Each time a crew sets up, a fire inspector will drop by to check things out, 
said Capt. Steve Wood, who was supervising the training program. 
</P>
<P>
In the more traditional portion of their instruction, the firefighters observed 
displays on the use and abuse of the most common type of equipment they will 
encounter on movie locations. 
</P>
<P>
Then they went to see Kevin McCarthy of Players Special Effects, who showed 
them the proper way to evoke every form of annihilation without hurting a soul. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy blew up charges called hits and squibs to break cables, demolish wood 
and explode a blood bag on his assistant's chest. He fired zirconium-loaded 
plastic balls out of an air gun to simulate strafing runs. He demonstrated 
various smoke machines and flash explosives. He lit a homemade flame thrower he 
uses to ignite stunt workers in fireproof suits. 
</P>
<P>
After splattering an entry wound on the fireman's forehead, McCarthy used a 
protective rig strapped to his assistant to demonstrate the technique of 
simulating a bullet's exit. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you ready to gore out?" he asked, touching the ignition wires to power. 
</P>
<P>
"Blood" splattered from the assistant's back onto a white backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
The firemen applauded the effect. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing up, McCarthy set a stunt man afire and made a mushroom cloud with 
gasoline in a mortar. The fireball went 30 feet in the air, the concussion 
setting off car alarms all around. 
</P>
<P>
Wood phoned fire dispatchers to tell them it was only make-believe.

PARKS WORKER WINS HEARING ON PROMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County hearing officer -- reviewing an employee's complaint that 
he lost a promotion to a "crony" of a Parks and Recreation Department official 
-- has found that the deparment violated Civil Service rules. 
</P>
<P>
William de la Garza, a 29-year county employee, contended that Henry Roman, a 
friend of a department official, was appointed to a regional director's job 
that de la Garza said had been promised to him. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing officer will recommend that de la Garza be placed in the position 
on a temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
Rees Lloyd, attorney for de la Garza, contended Roman was hired "under the 
guise of a training assignment," and had less experience in parks matters than 
de la Garza. 
</P>
<P>
John Huerta, a lawyer for the county, said Roman was a friend of a department 
official but denied that was a factor in his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Roman apparently was interviewed for the job at a French restaurant. Asked 
about that, Huerta said, "The county did not pick up the bill."

Armed men and soldiers shot to death 14 members of previously tolerated 
civilian defense groups, and angry mobs captured and killed three thugs, radio 
stations in Port-au-Prince said. The state hospital said that it treated at 
least 20 people for gunshot and machete wounds. Since Sunday, at least 40 
people have been reported killed in nightly shootings that were widely 
attributed to gangsters and to those still loyal to ousted leaders Lt. Gen. 
Prosper Avril and Jean-Claude Duvalier.

CENSUS STAGES A RECOUNT IN NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Census takers went into the fields of North San Diego County at dawn Friday to 
recount migrant workers, but the effort drew criticism from advocates for the 
homeless, who said they were suspicious of the results because the Census 
Bureau provided no advance notice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the skepticism, census officials proclaimed that they now had a 
"quality count" of the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel comfortable not only with our procedure, but with the execution of 
those procedures," said Dan Conway, a Census Bureau spokesman. "We're better 
organized this morning than we were 48 hours ago, and we now have a complete 
count of the migrant workers in North County." 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Weiler, assistant regional census manager based in Van Nuys, said 
workers only revisited half of the migrant camps that need recounting, and they 
intend to count the others sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we did have sufficient staff to at least start the process," Weiler 
said. "What we had done was a portion of the recount today, and we will do 
another portion next week." 
</P>
<P>
The conflicting comments from census officials and the apparent secrecy with 
which the recount was conducted have some homeless advocates saying the Census 
Bureau dealt in bad faith. The bureau, which acknowledged it had botched the 
migrant count earlier in the week, had said it would make procedural changes, 
use more bilingual census takers and retrain the "enumerators" before embarking 
on the recount. 
</P>
<P>
"I am suspicious," said Connie Saldana of Hispanic Services of the North County 
Interfaith Council who helped identify camp sites of homeless migrants. "It's 
curious that they did it so fast, and I would rather have seen them take a 
different method of counting." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Saldana nor any other homeless service provider was notified of the 
recount before it was conducted, nor were any media agencies, said Conway. 
Previously, census officials had said a recount probably would not take place 
until next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely feel that they were being sneaky about it," Saldana said. "To me 
it's very clear that they were trying to do it without any observers. I know if 
I had known about it, I would have gone again to observe." 
</P>
<P>
"I think part of it is that the Census Bureau was thinking, 'If there is any 
criticism, why have someone around to watch us count' ?" said Irma Castro of 
the Chicano Federation. "I don't think that anyone really feels that they did 
it right." 
</P>
<P>
When the original count of homeless people was conducted Tuesday night and 
Wednesday morning, the Census Bureau involved most homeless advocates in the 
area and alerted all the news outlets. Even before the count began, homeless 
advocates had decried the methodology being used as inadequate. But census 
officials said the recount showed that they recognized their shortcomings and 
were willing to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the ultimate evaluators. We know what we did and did not do," Conway 
said. "I think there's a certain level of credibility gained because we 
recognized that our original efforts did not meet our own standards." 
</P>
<P>
Conway said a recount had to be done quickly because the homeless population 
moves quickly and the bureau wanted an accurate demographic picture of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to move swiftly and we were focused on the operational 
component of the project, not the promotional component," Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Census Bureau officials said shortly after the original count that, in 
order for a recount to take place, they would "have to go back and do some 
reworking" of the operational plan and the number of sites visited, and 
retraining of enumerators and supervisory roles. 
</P>
<P>
"We need everything in place before we do this," said Weiler, the regional 
census official, on Wednesday. He added that a recount was not likely until 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, 250 enumerators from the Census 
Bureau's Carlsbad office took part in the nationwide operation to count the 
homeless. After the count was completed, Weiler reported that he had "a little 
bit of a concern in terms of the North County area," specifically that many of 
the migrant homeless were not interviewed and only head counts were taken. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that we feel we missed anything (in North County). It's that the 
enumerations should have been face-to-face," Weiler had said Wednesday. "One of 
the things we want to get is not just the head count but accurate 
characteristics as well." 
</P>
<P>
But migrant workers in the McGonigle Canyon area near Rancho Penasquitos said 
they were not interviewed by census workers on Wednesday morning and that no 
census workers were seen Friday at this, one of the largest migrant campsites 
in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"All they did was count people. They didn't ask the questions that they were 
supposed to ask," said Marco Antonio Guevara, who, like others interviewed at 
the camp, had experienced several censuses in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, it's all theater. They want to do what is necessary 
for their bureaucracy, but they don't really want to count us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of 30 people interviewed in the canyon off Black Mountain Road, none of them 
had been interviewed in-depth by census takers on the original count, and none 
had seen any enumerators on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Several people said census takers had trouble communicating with them during 
Wednesday's count, and, as far as they could tell, enumerators just took head 
counts. One migrant worker noted that people were leaving for work when the 
census takers arrived, making it difficult to get an accurate count. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an eleventh-hour final decision to do the recount, and we couldn't say 
we were going to do it until we knew we were going to do it," Conway said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The recount was conducted between 4:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. Friday by 70 
enumerators and nine supervisors. The count was preceded by a three-hour 
training session that began at 1:30 a.m. in the hope that mistakes made 
previously would not be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
The North County migrant homeless population was the only population that 
required a recount from the original count of the homeless, according to a 
Census Bureau spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on when to do the recount was based on the availability of 
bilingual enumerators to effectively do a count, Conway said, since there were 
very few Spanish-speaking census takers covering North County during the 
original operation. Bilingual enumerators who worked in other parts of the 
county were recruited to help in the North County recount. 
</P>
<P>
"Every team that was sent out this morning (Friday) had at least one bilingual 
speaker, sometimes more," Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made to go on with the count at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. Of the 
1:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. training session, Conway said, "We trained them on the 
importance of interviews, how to do interviews, and the techniques involved, 
and not just to do head counts." 
</P>
<P>
"We had improved training, and a select number of enumerators from the previous 
night. We used the ones that understood the process the best, and we had more 
supervisors for the recount," Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
Enumerators outnumbered supervisors in the original count by 20 to 1, while the 
ratio in the recount was 8 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The recount focused only on those areas of North County that had specific 
problems with enumerators not conducting interviews of the homeless, he said.

CONTRAS WILL DISBAND, SAYS ARCHBISHOP

<TEXT>
<P>
Nicaragua's Contras agreed Friday to begin disbanding their troops in Honduras 
by April 20, five days before a new civilian government is to take over in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of Managua, announced the 
agreement after a seven-hour meeting with leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance 
and representatives of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
The communique said the U.S.-backed rebels agreed to demobilize the 10,000 
fighters in bases in Yamales, Honduras, near the Nicaraguan border. It said the 
3,000 guerrillas inside Nicaragua would move into security zones supervised by 
Obando y Bravo and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's conservative, pro-American coalition defeated the leftist 
Sandinistas in the election, which was monitored by several thousand 
international observers. 
</P>
<P>
The communique said the rebels agreed to demobilize because the Feb. 25 
elections had "established a process of democratization" in Nicaragua. It did 
not mention when the disbanding would be completed. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels called for an immediate cease-fire between the Sandinista armed 
forces and the Contras inside Nicaragua to be supervised by the United Nations 
and Obando y Bravo. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's delegation to the talks agreed that the new administration would 
provide pensions to Contra widows and orphans and to wounded rebel veterans in 
"recognition of their patriotic labors." No details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamorro administration also promised to "assure the rehabilitation and 
social readaptation" of those affected by the war and to seek humanitarian and 
medical aid for the duration of the demobilization. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the rebels met with Obando y Bravo and Chamorro's representatives 
had come to Honduras to persuade the rebels to disband before her April 25 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
"In Central America, the time has come for arms to be silenced to make way for 
the search for a lasting regional peace," Obando y Bravo said before talks 
began at Toncontin air base outside the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of the armies also should be reduced for the purpose of seeking 
civilized solutions to the serious problems that afflict the great Central 
American nation." 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said he fully supports the agreement to 
begin disbanding the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"As president of Nicaragua I fully support this accord. I believe it goes in 
the direction of achieving peace and eliminating the war that has caused so 
much suffering, so much harm to the Nicaraguan people," he told reporters at 
the Managua airport, where he met representatives of the church and the new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who said the Contras must disband, has asked Congress to 
approve a $300-million aid package for Nicaragua that includes $45 million to 
demobilize and relocate the Contras and 42,000 relatives living in the base 
camp in Yamales, Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamorro delegation also agreed to set up a commission including 
representatives of the new government and of the Contras to monitor 
demobilization. The commission and humanitarian aid for the rebels and their 
families were conditions the Contras set for demobilization at the outset of 
Friday's talks. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels went into the talks with a long list of demands, including several 
-- such as the demobilization of the Sandinista army -- that would have 
required the agreement of the Sandinistas. The Sandinistas were not represented 
at the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Other rebel demands that were not part of the agreement: 
</P>
<P>
* The right to reclaim or receive compensation for property confiscated by the 
Sandinista government.

MEDFLY FIND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SPURS GROWER FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
State agriculture officials announced Friday that a single Mediterranean fruit 
fly has been discovered in Riverside County, marking a leap by the pest into a 
new corner of Southern California and raising the possibility of aerial 
spraying and quarantines on its orchard-rich lands. 
</P>
<P>
The immature female Medfly was trapped in a commercial orange grove Wednesday 
in the community of Woodcrest, about 45 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wallace, Riverside County agricultural commissioner, said intense trapping 
has begun over 81 square miles to determine if the fly is an isolated find or 
the first sign of a full-blown infestation in Southern California's richest 
agricultural county. Infestations already are being battled in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying or a quarantine on crops is not yet required because only one 
fly was found, Wallace said. But with the weather warming and plenty of food 
available for the pest around Woodcrest, he said the situation is precarious. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been worrying all my life about this day," Wallace said. "It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Word of the find spread quickly through Riverside's agricultural community, and 
the reaction among growers and political leaders was one of alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Los Angeles and Orange counties, Riverside County remains heavily 
reliant on agriculture. An infestation could wreak havoc on the county's 
leading crops, among them oranges, grapefruit, wine and table grapes, and 
dates. The citrus industry alone accounts for $175 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Norton Younglove, whose district includes the orange grove in 
which the Medfly was found, said he was "disappointed and extremely worried" 
when he learned of the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"We, like anybody else, hate to see this rascal running loose in our county," 
Younglove said. "I only hope it's just one isolated incident. . . . If we let 
that fly get established, it could have a very serious impact on Riverside 
County's economy." 
</P>
<P>
The Woodcrest discovery is the second in Southern California in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
A single immature female was found in Diamond Bar on Tuesday, prompting some 
scientists advising the state in the eradication program to question the 
current strategy against the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Henry J. Voss, the director of the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture, announced that he was rejecting the panel's advice and set a May 9 
deadline to end aerial spraying over the current infestation zones. In a switch 
of tactics, helicopter-borne pesticides will be replaced by sterile flies, 
released by the millions, in an effort to breed fertile Medflies out of 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
The panel unsuccessfully argued that the sterile flies should be held in 
reserve so there would be enough to combat any new outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Carey, a UC Davis entomologist and a member of the science advisory 
panel, said the discovery in Woodcrest shows that any optimism about beating 
the Medfly may be premature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear we have to rethink strategy now," Carey said. "I think we still 
need to find another fly or two, but it's becoming clear that it is throughout 
the Los Angeles Basin and that it is widespread and not contained." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County Supervisor Walt Abraham said the state's recent declaration 
that the Medfly problem was under control was "not too wise." 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the kind of situation you can ever totally beat," Abraham said. 
"We're treating it as a dire emergency. The stakes are very high." 
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely, absolutely shocked," said Tom Mazzetti, who farms 2,000 
acres of citrus and is president of Blue Banner Packing Co. in Riverside. "They 
hadn't found a fly in months and the state was planning to stop spraying a 
month early, so we were all optimistic. Now this. We just hope to goodness they 
don't find anymore and this is the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
An infestation, Mazzetti said, "would be devastating. If we get quarantined, 
there go our foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about the lost jobs," he added. "There's the trucking industry. The 
workers at the harbor. I don't think anyone realizes the impact this pest could 
have on our state." 
</P>
<P>
Mazzetti said he spent much of Friday fretting about the Medfly find with 
colleagues in the industry, worrying about the what-ifs that inevitably 
accompany such a discovery. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran grower said that if aerial spraying of malathion became necessary, 
he hoped his more urbanized neighbors would be more understanding than other 
Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Younglove was less hopeful: "I think the old-timers would be 
less upset, because they're accustomed to living with agriculture. But we have 
many citizens who have moved here from Orange County and L.A., and they won't 
feel any different than the people who are still there." 
</P>
<P>
The fly was found in a tree on the John Gless Ranch, a commercial citrus 
operation located just outside the southern boundary of the city of Riverside. 
The unincorporated area once was carpeted with verdant orange groves, but today 
it is dominated by new housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers held out hope that the discovery was an isolated find or that the 
fly was actually a misidentified sterile fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I think there is an awful lot of overreaction," said John S. Gless, 
ranch manager. "I believe the chances are it's a sterile fly." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Fisher, a state entomologist who worked on the identification, said there 
is a slight possibility that the fly is one of millions of harmless sterile 
flies that have been released in Southern California over the last few months 
to eradicate the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Sterile flies are dyed and are easily identifiable by a colored mark on their 
heads, although occasionally there are undyed sterile flies that must be 
dissected to confirm that they are sterile. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Fisher said there was no dye visible on its head, but the fly's 
organs were too badly decomposed to verify its identification. "It's a 90% to 
95% probability that it's wild," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERS HOLD UP ARMORED CAR GUARD IN STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two robbers waylaid an armored car guard carrying cash into a home improvement 
store in Van Nuys Friday, shot him in the hand and fled with a bag of money, 
witnesses and Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
It was at least the 19th such robbery in the Los Angeles area since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A suspect, who was not identified, was later arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers -- guns drawn -- followed the guard through the Home Depot store on 
Roscoe Boulevard, said an employee, who asked not to be identified. When the 
guard did not surrender his money "they shot him," the employee said. The 
guard, who was not identified, was treated at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHAMBER TO GIVE CONTROL OF HOLLYWOOD SIGN 
TO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has agreed to surrender control of the 
landmark Hollywood sign and dissolve a trust fund of more than $250,000 set up 
to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the money will go to the city Recreation and Parks Department, which 
will assume responsibility for maintaining the sign, sources said. The group 
has also reportedly agreed to repay the trust more than $40,000 in interest, in 
addition to the $45,000 in interest it voluntarily repaid last June after 
allegations became public that it mishandled funds earmarked for the sign's 
upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber's decision comes as the attorney general's office was about to 
conclude an audit of its finances.

LIBRARY'S FATE STILL A TALE OF SUSPENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Public Library Commission has postponed a decision on the fate 
of a historic 64-year-old library building after an emotional battle of book 
lovers at a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 mid-city residents crammed into the Washington Irving branch 
library Thursday night for the hearing on a library administration proposal to 
construct a larger facility several blocks away from the current Arlington 
Avenue site. 
</P>
<P>
The Irving branch, a 3,918-square-foot stucco-and-brick building, was named to 
the city's list of historic monuments four years ago. It would be turned over 
to the city for undetermined use if the commission builds a new library on a 
Washington Boulevard property now occupied by a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
A slight majority of the 39 neighborhood residents addressing the commission 
favored retaining the old building, which is named after the 19th-Century 
author of "Rip van Winkle," the tale of a man who awakens after 20 years' sleep 
to find everything different. The airy Irving library, which would have to be 
upgraded to meet earthquake safety standards, has itself undergone no major 
physical changes since its construction in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
"What I value is being able to bring my 3 1/2-year-old to a place where you can 
still open the windows," said educational researcher Harry Brown-Hiegel. "And 
(this is) a place that you can say: This is what my granddaddy went to." 
</P>
<P>
However, a sizable minority of the witnesses spoke in favor of a new library 
building on the site of Freddy Dee's Carwash, 13 blocks to the west. 
</P>
<P>
"As a writer, I have to go to the Hollywood branch to do serious research," 
said author Kirk Honeycutt. "This service area is in crying need for a new 
library." 
</P>
<P>
Other proponents of a new building handed the commissioners statements of 
support from principals of five schools close to the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
After the 2 1/2-hour hearing, which library officials said drew the largest 
turnout in recent memory, the commission voted unanimously to postpone a 
decision until its May 3 meeting.

REPORTS OF CHEATING BRING CALL BY FIRE CHIEF FOR NEW JOB EXAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Chief Michael Freeman called Friday for the retesting 
of about 5,000 firefighter applicants who recently took an entry-level aptitude 
examination marred by reports of possible cheating. 
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded that the results of this test cannot be relied upon," Freeman 
said. "I think confidence in the results has been damaged." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said he has asked the county's Internal Services Department, which 
prepared, administered and provided security for the challenged exam, to 
prepare and administer a new test. He estimated that retesting will cost tens 
of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"We will notify all the candidates that took this test and advise them of the 
date and time for retesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman's actions came swiftly on the heels of a hurry-up ISD investigation of 
rumors that an unknown number of candidates may have breached the security of 
the test by studying the actual examination in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Reports on Thursday alleged that authorities had received a copy of an exam 
used to tutor some applicants that was exactly the same as the official 
version. But Freeman said on Friday that investigators determined the tutoring 
exam is not an exact copy of the official test. 
</P>
<P>
"They (ISD investigators) did determine there was no security breach in that 
they have accounted for all test booklets that were used," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said, however, that there were a "significant number of the same 
questions available to candidates" who may have had copies of the tutoring 
exam. But Freeman said it is possible that the verbatim questions could have 
come from previous tests or from practice exams. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman noted that tutorial sessions are provided by a number of organizations, 
and it is difficult to target anyone for wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," Freeman said, "it does not appear that there were improprieties on 
anyone's part. Of course, I will continue to gather information and develop a 
complete picture of what occurred. If additional action is necessary, I 
certainly will take it." 
</P>
<P>
County investigators were unavailable late Friday to comment on how many 
questions on the official test of department applicants recently could appear 
in verbatim form elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it was not immediately known how long it will take ISD testers to rewrite 
the entry-level examination, aimed basically at testing mechanical aptitude, 
and re-administer it to thousands of candidates who hope to be included on the 
Fire Department's hiring list. 
</P>
<P>
The potential candidates also face crucial oral interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department is offering about 200 jobs to the thousands of candidates 
who have been tested recently. The last qualifying exam was administered about 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think . . . it goes without saying that there is a tremendous interest in 
the job," Freeman said.

RESEARCHER TO CLARIFY TIES TO DRUG COMPANY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: JOURNAL WILL FOLLOW UP UCLA DOCTOR'S EDITORIAL ON VACCINES WITH 
STATEMENT HE IS CONSULTANT TO A FIRM THAT MAKES THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prominent UCLA researcher, who wrote an editorial dismissing the likelihood 
of neurological illness from pertussis vaccines, will publish a clarification 
noting that he omitted mentioning he is a paid consultant to a vaccine 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James D. Cherry, a professor of pediatrics, agreed to the clarification 
after the Journal of the American Medical Assn. learned that he failed to make 
the kind of financial disclosure required of journal authors since last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Cherry's financial disclosure was incomplete, and we will be publishing 
his statement of clarification in the next available issue of JAMA," John 
Hammarley, science news editor for the American Medical Assn., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry, a longtime vaccine researcher, is a consultant to Lederle Laboratories, 
one of two U.S. manufacturers of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) 
vaccine. He has also received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of 
research grants from Lederle and other firms. 
</P>
<P>
In the editorial, published Friday in the journal, Cherry endorsed the 
conclusions of a paper published elsewhere in the issue in which researchers at 
Vanderbilt University studied 38,000 vaccinated children and found no increased 
risk of seizures. One of the authors of that paper also failed to disclose his 
ties to Lederle. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry said he chose not to mention his ties to Lederle in the disclosure 
statement he submitted to the journal. In an interview Thursday, he said he 
believed such a disclosure was not necessary since the editorial concerned DTP 
vaccines in general, not one in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular editorial relates in no way to a specific manufacturer, it 
relates to pertussis vaccine," Cherry said. "Anybody who has done any research 
in fields like this has done contract studies with various companies. 
</P>
<P>
"When I signed this thing, I actually thought about it, and I read it sort of 
carefully because I know this is a sensitive area," he said. "As it turns out, 
I did think about this. I thought this is generic, not really specific." 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose this week when a reporter for a Boston television station 
learned of Cherry's ties to Lederle and his failure to declare them. The 
reporter, with WHDH-TV, contacted Cherry, who says he then contacted the 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
Since October, the journal has required all authors to identify "any 
affiliation or financial involvement that may be considered a conflict of 
interest." The new policy was prompted by a growing national concern about 
ethics in biomedical research. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosed information may or may not be published along with the author's 
paper. The journal's editors decide whether the information is important for 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edward A. Mortimer Jr., a co-author of the Vanderbilt paper, acknowledged 
Thursday that he, too, failed to disclose he is a paid consultant to Lederle. 
As with Cherry, he said Lederle pays his university, and the money goes back 
into research, not into his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Mortimer, whose case has not been brought before the JAMA editorial board, 
pointed out that most experts in the field have ties to companies.

HARMON, THREE KICKERS AMONG SIX NEW CHARGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Chargers had a busy day in the free-agent market Friday, announcing they 
agreed to terms with six players, most notably running back Ronnie Harmon, a 
former first-round draft choice of the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Three kickers were included in the group, but none was Mike Lansford, the Rams' 
all-time leading scorer who worked out for the Chargers Thursday. The biggest 
addition was Harmon, the former Iowa player and 16th player taken in the 1986 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers beat out Phoenix and Washington for Harmon's services in what was 
an active few days of talks involving the teams and Lou Oppenheim, Harmon's New 
York-based agent. The Chargers did not release details of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, 25, had been a disappointment in Buffalo since the Bills drafted him 
with the intention that he would become their top running back. He instead 
became a role player, most noted for his receiving ability; he actually has 
more career receiving than rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
In four seasons, Harmon has rushed 244 times for 968 yards and three touchdowns 
and caught 144 passes for 1,452 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also has returned a 
total of 48 kickoffs for 1,009 yards, an average of 21.0 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Harmon carried only 17 times for 99 yards but caught 29 passes for 
363 yards and four touchdowns. His best season was 1987, when he rushed for 485 
yards and two touchdowns on 116 carries and caught 56 passes for 477 yards and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said through a spokesman that the 
acquisition of Harmon and the earlier Plan B signing of running back Thomas 
Sanders from the Chicago Bears will not affect the Chargers' interest in 
running back Gary Anderson, the 1988 team most valuable player who sat out last 
season in a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon is the second Plan B player the Chargers have taken from the Bills. Last 
week, they announced the signing of punter John Kidd, a six-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the three kickers apparently means an end to Chris Bahr's 
Charger career. Bahr, 37, was signed by the Chargers as a Plan B player last 
year after 13 seasons with the Raiders and Cincinnati Bengals. He was left 
unprotected under Plan B by the Chargers this year. 
</P>
<P>
In line to replace Bahr are John Carney, a Plan B free agent from Tampa Bay; 
Fuad Reveiz, released last season after four years with the Miami Dolphins, and 
Barry Belli, a former Fresno State player who has spent time in training camp 
with New England and the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
This does not necessarily mean the end of the Chargers' interest in Lansford, 
Beathard said through the spokesman. The Chargers are awaiting a contract 
proposal from Lansford's agent, Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
The other two players who agreed to terms with the Chargers were linebacker 
Henry Rolling, a 1987 fifth-round draft choice who was released by Tampa Bay 
last season, and defensive lineman Nate Hill, a 1988 sixth-round choice of 
Green Bay who since has spent time with Indianapolis and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, who have agreed to terms with seven Plan B players, also lost 
their third Plan B player Friday when punter Hank Ilesic signed with the Rams. 
Ilesic, who joined the Chargers before the third game of 1989 after 13 seasons 
in the Canadian Football League, was expendable after the signing of Kidd.

SCOTT HAS HIS MIND SET ON A CARLSBAD COMEBACK 
</P>

<P>
Steve Scott in person is a little different from Steve Scott in a news release 
for the Carlsbad 5,000 meter road race. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is in an unusual situation for this time of year, anyway. The Carlsbad 
race is Sunday, and Scott -- who has twice run world 5,000 bests in it -- is 
attempting to regain his championship rather than defend it. After three 
consecutive victories, he slumped last year and finished sixth as Yobes Ondieki 
lowered the world best to 13:26. 
</P>
<P>
Which leads to the news release, which contains this quote from Scott: "I'm 
coming back with a vengeance this year. I was embarrassed in 1989 in front of 
my hometown crowd, and it's a very important 1990 goal to win this race. It's 
my race, I designed the course and helped create the event. I will win it again 
in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Strong words, and they came up again one morning earlier this week. It was a 
postcard-perfect day, warm and sunny, and the light was shining through several 
large windows in Scott's open, airy house. 
</P>
<P>
The man who uttered those words was sitting in a chair in his living room with 
a 4-week-old boxer puppy on his lap. The puppy was sound asleep. Scott 
chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that," he said. "I think I'll revise the press release a little. I think 
I'm physically and mentally ready enough to win. I'll go out and race, and if I 
don't win, I will have been beaten by a better person on that day. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't have physically, I think I can make up mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, the thinking man's runner, has been working on his mental approach 
during the past year. He found himself a local coach who stresses the "mental 
and spiritual side" of running and even took some time off. Neither a San 
Diego-area coach nor a break had been on his itinerary before. 
</P>
<P>
Not that anything was wrong with his way. Way back when, the four-minute mile 
used to be magic. Scott has broken it 125 times. He has run in two Olympics. 
Scott, 33, was the top-rated miler in the United States for 11 years before 
slipping to second, where he is now, behind Jeff Atkinson of Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
He has a nice house, a high school sweetheart as a wife, two children, three 
dogs, two cats, two chinchillas and a boa constrictor named Larry. Larry Boa. 
</P>
<P>
Trim and barefoot, wearing a T-shirt and shorts, Scott stretched in his chair 
and looked as if he didn't have a care in the world. He talked, he smiled, he 
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
You looked hard. It didn't matter. At a glance, in these surroundings, you 
wouldn't know that the past year has been one of his most difficult. Starting, 
roughly, with Carlsbad a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Outside of last year, Carlsbad has always been fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott has always been proud of his consistency. He has never suffered a major 
injury. His body has always obeyed the commands he gave it, through interval 
training, long distance runs and weights. 
</P>
<P>
"Faster," said the mind, and faster the body would go. 
</P>
<P>
"Harder," said the mind, and harder the legs would pump. 
</P>
<P>
But toward the middle of 1989, suddenly, his body wouldn't go faster, and his 
legs wouldn't pump harder. 
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the year, when you're supposed to be at your peak, I totally 
fell apart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing fifth in the 1,500-meters in the 1988 Olympics, he kept on 
pushing himself. He didn't take a substantial break. He thinks he paid for it 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is different in an Olympic year," he said. "The stress, strain, 
travel and expectations. I think it's very important to take a complete break 
for a substantial period of time after a year like that." 
</P>
<P>
But he did not take that break. He finally hit the wall during the European 
season last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I'm supposed to shine, and I sputtered," he said. "I was running 
on empty for so long, and finally I reached the end and just stopped." 
</P>
<P>
At first, he kind of semi-stopped. He would take a couple of days off, start 
training again, not feel right and then take a couple of more days off. He 
tried running intervals, he tried running distance. He was without a coach, 
drifting along, confused. 
</P>
<P>
"You reach that point where there is nobody there to advise you, and you're 
just lost," he said. "That's when I decided I needed someone." 
</P>
<P>
He had someone, Arch Jelley, from New Zealand. But it was a long distance 
relationship, and Scott wanted someone closer to home. So, when he was in 
London in July, he looked up Al Gilbert, a 62-year-old retiree who lives in 
Leucadia and formerly taught and coached at Chula Vista High School and 
Southwestern and MiraCosta Community Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was in London to visit his daughter Cindy, a high jumper on the 1972 
U.S. Olympic team and friend of Scott's. Scott worked out under Gilbert's 
supervision once in London and then came home and took two months off. He 
worked out in a pool six days a week during September and did nothing in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful," he said. "The quickest month of my life. It was tough to 
get motivated again, which probably shows I should have taken more time off." 
</P>
<P>
But the Scotts were having an addition built onto their house and, well, they 
had to pay for it somehow. That meant Steve had to get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
But during his time off, he learned a valuable lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"There are situations where you have to force yourself to take time off," he 
said. "In future years, I'll take off as much time as I need." 
</P>
<P>
He called Gilbert when he was ready to start training again, and he now works 
in front of Gilbert a couple of times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tackling more the mental approach to running," Scott said. "A lot of 
form work. At the same time we work on form, we're working on the mind. We're 
trying to open up mentally and not be restrained by our own thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even come close to understanding it, but we've let it work for us, 
and I think that's one of the biggest positive changes that have occurred this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
So once again, he thinks he is running in the right direction. And now, for the 
first time, he isn't under pressure to repeat in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a blessing in disguise," he said of the 1989 loss. "It wasn't a 
close loss; it was a blowout. Now, I can have fun. Last year, it wasn't as much 
fun going into the race because I felt the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Because Carlsbad is one of his pets, he talks world-class acquaintances into 
entering. But because the race does not pay appearance fees, only prize money, 
nobody is obligated to show up. So Scott will have a difficult time sizing up 
his competition until he steps to the starting line. He mentions Doug Padilla, 
who dominated the indoor track season this winter, and the kid from Algeria, 
Nourredine Morceli, a student at Riverside Community College who ran a personal 
best 3:55 mile in The Times' indoor meet in February. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know if (Morceli) is coming or not," he said. "Time-wise, I think 
it will take a 13:30-type effort to win. Maybe faster, depending on who shows 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Then he paused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about what everybody else is doing," he said. "I have no control 
over that. My own mental fitness and preparedness for the race are the only 
things I have control over." 
</P>
<P>

BAD DAY FAR BEHIND FOR ALOMAR; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? TWO YEARS AGO, THEY SENT HIM DOWN. 
</P>

<P>
It hardly seems possible. Come on, can it really be? Just two years? 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like it happened a long time ago," Padre second baseman Roberto 
Alomar said, "but if it really was a long time, then how come I remember it so 
clearly. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember every single detail of that day. Everything. Maybe someday I'll 
forget. But when bad things happen, you tend to remember everything." 
</P>
<P>
It was two years ago today, in a smoked-filled room at the Ray Kroc Complex, 
that the decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Velazquez Alomar was going to be sent down to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
The only question: Who would tell him? 
</P>
<P>
This was a kid who was hitting .360 in spring training. He was superb in the 
field. He stole the hearts of everyone who watched him. 
</P>
<P>
But after determining that a 20-year-old was too immature to inherit the 
Padres' starting second base job, Manager Larry Bowa and President Chub Feeney 
told Alomar the following day. The reaction was uncontrollable tears. Alomar 
was left alone with his sorrow in the training room, trying to regain his 
composure. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew that Robbie got a raw deal," said former Padre infielder Tim 
Flannery, "but that's the nature of the business. I remember going into the 
trainer's room that day and just saying, 'Keep your head up. The right time 
will come for you. You're going to be playing a long, long time in the big 
leagues. You're not even going to remember this day.' " 
</P>
<P>
You don't think this is a crazy business? 
</P>
<P>
In the time it has now taken Alomar to reach the ripe old age of 22, Bowa and 
Feeney have been fired, Flannery has retired and Alomar has emerged as one of 
the better second basemen in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable, isn't it?" Flannery said. "There's no one like him. There's 
not many guys I'd go pay and watch play, but this kid's worth the price of 
admission any day." 
</P>
<P>
For a guy who's barely old enough to buy a drink and still can't purchase so 
much as a beer without being carded, he's as much a key to the Padres' success 
as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Lest you forget, it was Alomar who batted .326 in July, .321 in August and .365 
in September last season. It was Alomar who finished runner-up in the Silver 
Bat award among second baseman with his .295 average, 56 RBIs and 42 stolen 
bases. And it was Alomar who finished runner-up for the Gold Glove, with his 
range helping disguise a league-high 28 errors. 
</P>
<P>
The only flaw in this guy's resume is that it'll be 43 more years before he 
starts drawing a full pension. 
</P>
<P>
"People are already telling me I'm going to be in the Hall of Fame, and I'll be 
so rich," Alomar said, "but I just smile and nod my head. I'm not going to go 
around saying, 'Robbie Alomar is a great second baseman.' If you guys want to 
say it, go right on ahead, but leave me out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the same guy I always was, it's just the thing that I've always dreamed 
for is coming true." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if he hadn't started having this dream 20 years ago, he would realize the 
significance of his meteoric rise through baseball. But when you've dedicated 
your whole life to the sport well before the senior prom, why should you be 
surprised by success. 
</P>
<P>
"All Roberto ever said was how much he wants to play baseball," said Maria 
Alomar, Roberto's mother. "I told him, 'Robbie, it's not so easy.' But he says 
to me, 'Mama, I want to play baseball in the major leagues. If I don't, I'll 
cry.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's all he ever thought about. He didn't even play any other sports. I'm 
telling you, it was his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one night I woke up at 3 o'clock in the morning. I got up to go to 
the bathroom. The light was on in Roberto's room. I opened the door, and there 
he was, exercising. Can you believe it? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the hardest day in his life was when Sandy (Roberto's father) finished 
his career in Texas. Robbie cried, he cried so much. He said, 'Dad, I want you 
to keep playing. Please play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Sandy Alomar, now the Padres' third-base coach: "When I was with the 
Angels, Robbie was 2 years old. He knew all of the Angels' players by their 
numbers. I could say a number, and he'd tell who it was. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had to punish him, I never had to spank him. All I had to do was take 
his bat and glove away. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no doubt in his mind, and eventually mine, he was going to be a 
big-league ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
Little did Sandy Alomar, or anyone else for that matter, realize just how good 
he might become. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that Sandy Alomar was a pretty fair second baseman in his day, 
playing 15 years in the big leagues and earning an All-Star berth in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Well, in two full seasons, his kid has driven in more runs than Sandy did in 
eight and hit more homers than he did throughout his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask me to compare us," Sandy Alomar said, "but what's there to compare? 
There's no comparison. He's bigger. He's stronger. He's faster. There's nothing 
left any more." 
</P>
<P>
Alomar, who will become the first Padre since Juan Bonilla (1981-1983) to be 
the opening day second baseman in consecutive seasons, has just one regret. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Sandy Jr., won't be along to see him. 
</P>
<P>
The master plan was for the Alomars to become the Ripken family of the National 
League; father in the third-base coaching box, Sandy behind the plate and 
Roberto at second. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, everything was put on hold, if not forever terminated, on Dec. 6 when 
Sandy was traded to the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you the truth, it feels strange without him," Roberto said. "You're 
together for so long, and you talk about how we'll one day play together, and 
then he's gone. 
</P>
<P>
"But I know deep in my heart, this is the best thing for him. He's in the big 
leagues, and that's what's important." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sandy Jr.: "It feels weird being in a different camp all these years, and 
now being in Tucson, but I know this is best. Maybe it's best for San Diego, 
too. I hope they remember me if Joe Carter (acquired in the Alomar trade) has a 
good year and they get into the World Series. The least they should do is get 
me tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the hardest part of this is being in a different league. It would have 
been fun to play against Robbie and then throwing him out while he's trying to 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
"But you know what would have been the best thing? Watching Robbie play every 
day. I know he's my brother, but he's so good you forget he's part of your own 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Funny what can happen in two years, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst has been chosen to start the season opener against the Dodgers on 
April 9, according to sources. The Padres are not expected to make the official 
announcement for about a week, but the Padres have already plotted a pitching 
rotation that has Hurst going in the opener for the second consecutive season. 
Hurst will start the Padres' first exhibition game Monday against the Angels 
and will be relieved by Mark Grant and Pat Clements. The Angels have scheduled 
Mark Langston, Mike Witt, Bryan Harvey, Scott Bailes and Bob McClure to pitch 
in the game. On Tuesday, Eric Show, Rafael Valdez, and Craig Lefferts are 
scheduled for the Padres. Calvin Schiraldi will start in the 'B" game. Andy 
Benes is the scheduled starter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres tentatively are scheduled to make up three of their canceled games 
against the Dodgers at the conclusion of the season Oct. 1-Oct. 3 at Dodger 
Stadium. They will make up their three-game home series against the Cincinnati 
Reds during the season. . . . Bip Roberts, who has been on a hitting tear ever 
since camp opened, was merciless in batting practice Friday. He hit a ball that 
nailed pitcher Greg Harris in the ribs early during batting practice and a few 
minutes later hit a ball up the middle that grazed coach Greg Riddoch. "Son, 
you should sit down right now and come back in April," said Amos Otis, the 
batting coach. . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon, wanting to make sure his 
veterans are physically ready before they play in any exhibitions, has decided 
to keep four of his starters on the bench Monday: first baseman Jack Clark, 
center fielder Joe Carter, catcher Benito Santiago and shortstop Garry 
Templeton. . . . Alex Cole, who will start in center field for the exhibition 
opener, has been timed in 6.1 seconds in the 60. Does he think he can beat out 
Bo Jackson for the unofficial title as baseball's fastest player? "I don't 
know," he said, "but I'd sure like to give it a try." . . . The Padres made 
sure that drinking was cut to a minimum Friday night; they scheduled physicals 
for Saturday morning, prohibiting consumption of food and liquids after 10 p.m.

DID REFEREE STEELE HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Replaying the Chavez-Taylor fight on tape, I saw the intense single-minded 
concentration of an example of how good a referee can be. 
</P>
<P>
The questioning of Taylor immediately after the count was over and the 
incredible compassion on Steele's face as he wrapped his arms around Taylor 
gave me insight into the best referee I have ever seen. What showed on Steele's 
face was care, love and sorrow that he had to stop the fight, but he had to 
stop it. 
</P>
<P>
I wish the rest of the governing parts of the sport acted with the integrity of 
Richard Steele.

HARMON OF MICHIGAN MADE A DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Murray did nicely in his farewell piece on Tom Harmon, all the way up to 
where he stated, "You never went into a room with Harmon without someone coming 
up to you and recalling, 'the day you beat us at Minnesota . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
Wrong, In Harmon's career at Michigan, his team never beat Minnesota, taking 
three consecutive losses, and that fact was always a thorn in his memory and a 
point of pride with Gopher fans and Coach Bernie Bierman.

HARMON OF MICHIGAN MADE A DIFFERENCE

Every person in radio and television sports broadcasting is able to do a better 
job because of Tom Harmon. In 1958, he gathered together a group of sports 
announcers to end the second-class citizenship under which we worked. 
</P>
<P>
We had to wait outside press conference rooms after major sports events until 
the print media representatives had concluded their questioning of players and 
coaches. Then we were allowed to conduct a second press conference with 
fatigued athletes. Getting locations at many sports events found us pushed away 
from the center of action in favor of the print media. 
</P>
<P>
That day we formed the Southern California Sports Broadcasters. Tom led the 
fight to get us nothing more than equal opportunities to cover sports events 
and press conferences. His name and his reputation, plus his announcing of 
sports events from coast to coast, gave him many opportunities to carry on the 
fight.

LATIN BASEBALL PLAYERS ARE STILL FACING MAJOR-LEAGUE BARRIERS

<P>
For many baseball executives, the ideal player is a white farm boy from Iowa. 
Many baseball executives were once, not coincidentally, someone very much like 
that themselves. They threw balls against a barn one day and were in the big 
leagues the next. Either that, or they played eight years in the Three-I 
League, scratching and spitting and otherwise trying to be the American ideal. 
</P>
<P>
None of them grew up in the Dominican Republic. Or wore heavy gold chains. Or 
spoke Spanish as a first language. Or was dumped at age 16 in a foreign country 
where he couldn't even order dinner. In Pedro Guerrero's first year in America, 
he ordered chicken every night, that being the only food word he knew. He would 
also cry himself to sleep, an experience he shares with virtually every other 
Latin player who makes his way to the United States, where all the fields are 
fields of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Bautista, raised in a Dominican family of 16 children, arrived at 
Kingsport, Tenn., a farm club of the New York Mets, at age 16. He knew a little 
English, having spent some of his childhood in New York, living with an aunt. 
But he didn't know much else, except that he was scared and lonely and couldn't 
figure how he was possibly going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I cried," he says now. "I cry every night. I want to go home, to be with 
my mother. I was very, very lonely." 
</P>
<P>
He stayed, as many Latins do, because baseball is the most visible route out of 
the poverty that afflicts the Caribbean nations and much of Central America. 
And now, nine years later, Bautista is struggling to find a place in the 
Baltimore Orioles' starting rotation, hoping to be a success story. 
</P>
<P>
But that's hardly the entire story. Here's another part: There was the baseball 
executive who once confided to me that Dominicans were stubborn and 
uncoachable, if not outright dangerous. Then there was a rival general manager, 
in the 1987 season, who said that the Toronto Blue Jays would inevitably fold 
in the stretch because they fielded too many Latin players. 
</P>
<P>
And this, too: Bautista takes aside younger Latin players and warns them 
against speaking Spanish too loudly in the clubhouse. "Some players get mad," 
he says. "They think these guys talking Spanish are talking about them. They 
yell, 'Speak English. Speak English."' 
</P>
<P>
Latin players are different. Ask anyone. Name your five favorite head cases, 
and I'll bet four of them are Latinos. Who are the hot dogs? Who are the 
malcontents? Who doesn't quite fit in? 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in baseball is that we don't take the time to understand the Latin 
player," Orioles Manager Frank Robinson says. "We typecast them because that's 
the easy thing to do. There are cultural differences that we don't take into 
account. Latin culture is different from American culture. The language is 
different. A Latin player might be flashier or more flamboyant, but that might 
be part of his culture. We need to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Bautista has the look. You can't help but notice that. He has a certain swagger 
and wears a certain cut of clothes. Add the gold chains and the designer shades 
and you have a style that was once called machismo. He pitches that way, too, 
or so it's popularly understood. He pitches with a swagger, trying to fire 
fastballs past batters who, instead, too often hit them out of the park. Last 
year, he bombed out after some early promise to take his place in Rochester. He 
had a bad back, he says, that he didn't tell anyone about, and he had a 
blistered finger no one could stop from bleeding. No one could staunch the 
bleeding from the mound either. And now, he faces a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
Is Bautista too stubborn to learn? Or is there a language problem that gets in 
the way of the kinds of nuance that make good coaching meaningful? And how can 
you tell the difference? 
</P>
<P>
"For many Latin players, language is the big problem," Robinson said. "They 
can't read a paper. They can't order from a menu. They can't watch TV. And on 
the field, you don't know how much you're saying is being understood. Even with 
Bautista, who speaks pretty good English, you don't know exactly how much he 
understands. A young player is not going to stop you in the middle of 
explaining something and ask you to slow down. If you ask him if he 
understands, he just nods. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking too much of that player, to be away from home, to speak another 
language when we don't bother to learn his, and then to play baseball, too. 
It's amazing to me how many do make it." 
</P>
<P>
Many do, of course. Just check the rosters. Bautista hopes to be the right kind 
of statistic, and says that after nine years the language problems don't amount 
for much in his case. But he says, too, that he translates English into his 
head into Spanish and then answers questions in his head in Spanish and 
translates them back to English. He says it makes him tired sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
He was tired Thursday, but only from running. In the off-season, he pitched 
winter ball, as usual, and worked on straightening out his forkball. He thinks 
he can be a better pitcher this year and is ready to start, relieve or do 
whatever he can to make the club. He isn't worried about not getting a fair 
shake. 
</P>
<P>
"All the players here are treated the same," he says. 
</P>
<P>
They all should be, with Robinson as manager. He understands prejudice, of 
course, having dealt with it. He understands stereotyping, having dealt with 
that, too. In Robinson's day, it was often the black player who didn't fit in, 
who was the hothead, who was the hot dog. And Robinson knows, too, about 
dealing with cultural differences. Once when he was managing in the off-season 
in a small town in Mexico, he left because he couldn't deal with being the only 
person who spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball must address this situation," Robinson said. "It wouldn't be that 
difficult. In our organization, we should have someone in every town to help 
the Latin players, someone they can turn to when they've got a problem. We 
should have English classes for them, not so they won't speak Spanish, but just 
so they can do the simple things to get along. And why can't managers be 
required to take Spanish classes? We expect them to come over here and adjust 
to us, and we don't make any effort to adjust to them." 
</P>
<P>
Bautista and others try to take in the younger Latin players. They teach them 
how to order from a menu, how to shop at the mall, how to get along with the 
coaches and managers. They talk to them in Spanish about coping in a place 
where they speak English, and they talk to them quietly, just so no one 
misunderstands.

MARSHALL, MADAGAN BATTLE AT FIRST BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For an organization whose primary concern in recent years was first place, the 
new topic of conversation for the New York Mets is first base. Now that Keith 
Hernandez has taken his Gold Glove and his ailing legs to Cleveland, there is 
uncertainty at what was the most secured position on the Mets. In reference to 
the most famous of all baseball questions, the answer favored here in the first 
week of an accelerated spring training camp is two's on first. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates, reading from left-handed hitter to right, are Dave Magadan and 
Mike Marshall. Magadan, a line-drive hitter with limited power, was the heir 
apparent when Hernandez was told that he would not be tendered a new contract 
in the aftermath of the 1989 season. Marshall, a bigger man whose power surges 
occasionally have been short-circuited by lower back problems, was acquired 
from the Los Angeles Dodgers in December in the trade that sent the unhappy 
Juan Samuel to greener pastures. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the transaction, there was little indication of the competition 
to come. Manager Davey Johnson said that he was undecided about using Marshall 
in the infield or in the outfield. He hadn't started a game at first base since 
midsummer 1988, and of his 836 starts with the Dodgers, 732 were as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
But in the time since the locks were removed at the St. Lucie County Sports 
Complex in Florida and the 1990 Mets streamed through the gates, Johnson 
developed a Marshall plan. "I'm not going to have him take any fly balls for a 
while," the manager said at the start of another prolonged session. The only 
glove Marshall removed from his locker Thursday was a black first baseman's 
mitt, with a hint of gold at the tip. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to work out at first," said Marshall, who stayed on the field 
after his scheduled time to take short-hop throws from Coach Bud Harrelson. 
"I've been around a little while. It's a cliche but I'll do what's best for the 
team. They think it's best that I'm at first." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as two years ago, Marshall had to beg off first base because it was 
placing added strain on his back. He moved to rightfield, where he started the 
last 88 games in the Dodgers' championship season. Nineteen eighty-eight 
happened to be the only season in the last six in which Marshall's name did not 
appear on the disasbled list. 
</P>
<P>
"First base is more demanding," he said, "but I'm healthy enough to handle it 
now. I'm confident I can play there every day." 
</P>
<P>
There is reason to believe that management is envisioning just such a 
possibility. Johnson prefers to platoon only if the two players fit the same 
slot in the lineup, but Marshall is an ideal fifth or sixth hitter and Magadan 
is better suited to the top of the order. Although the manager conceded that 
the job probably will not be won before the team breaks camp, he said, "I'd 
like to see first base handled by somebody in the early stage of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Magadan said that Johnson hadn't spoken to him about the situation. "But I'm 
sure he knows what he's going to do," Magadan said. "He's not going to base it 
on 10 spring training games." What about the manager's contention as recently 
as two weeks ago that he didn't have a position for Marshall? "I think he did 
that to be diplomatic," Magadan said, "to appease me." 
</P>
<P>
It did not go unnoticed that Frank Cashen had referred to Marshall as a "hidden 
treasure" after the completion of the deal. The general manager noted Thusday 
that the slugger had averaged .270, 20 homers and approximately 80 runs batted 
in for each of his full major-league seasons. "In today's lexicon," Cashen 
said, "that's considered a superstar. But he's still a relative unknown." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall agreed with the assessment. "I don't complain, do things like that," 
he said. "But I don't think I ever got my due. I protected (Pedro) Guerrero, 
then I batted behind (Kirk) Gibson, then Eddie Murray. And the only thing I 
ever got attention for was the games I missed with my back." 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, Marshall is an answer to one of the more interesting trivia questions 
in recent years. In 1988, Gibson's MVP season, who led the Dodgers in RBI? 
Gibson had 76, six fewer than Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the luxury of batting fifth in L.A., behind the two best hitters," 
Marshall said. "But if I bat sixth here, either me or Dave, the pitcher may be 
a little dizzy by the time he got to me. After Howard (Johnson), Darryl 
(Strawberry) and Kevin (McReynolds), you're going to be in situations where you 
drive in a lot of runs. This lineup should really test you." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly if Marshall can restore some of the right-handed power that 
declined last year with the falloff of McReynolds and the disappearance of Gary 
Carter. His back sidelined him for the entire month of June in 1989 and it 
curtailed his season in September. For the first time in his career, he failed 
to hit as many as 16 homers or drive in at least as 50 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, playing in only 105 games, Marshall hit more homers (11) and drove in 
almost as many runs (42) as all the Mets first basemen totaled in 162 games. 
That may explain why there was excitement in Al Harazin's voice Thursday when 
the club's senior vice president watched Marshall drive balls to distant 
sections of the field during batting practice. "I think he's going to have a 
big year," Harazin said. "He's looked great, and he's motivated." 
</P>
<P>
After putting away his bat, Marshall reclaimed his glove and went to school at 
first base long after most of his teammates had headed for the showers. As long 
as he performs adequately in the field and stays healthy, the man may find a 
steady job in New York. "I want to watch them both defensively," Johnson said. 
"I know what both are capable of offensively, but I have a better read on 
Magadan."

DETROIT CRANKING OUT A BIG WINNER

Bill Laimbeer looked at his interrogator with the condescending expression he 
usually sports during interviews. The question: Was he worried. 
</P>
<P>
"About what?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
About whether his Detroit Pistons might tail off at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a stupid question." 
</P>
<P>
Well, isn't it possible that Detroit, which has gone 25-2 since Jan. 23, which 
already has a playoff spot clinched, which has the best record in the league at 
51-16, might at some point go flat? Might lose again? 
</P>
<P>
"Next question," Laimbeer said. "We've got enough guys on our team that we 
don't have flat games." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, the Pistons really don't seem to have flat games. And what's 
strange about it is no one in the league acts surprised anymore. Detroit 
routinely gave a good Chicago Bulls team a 25-point shellacking at home. Well, 
what can you do? They're the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"Detroit plays with a lot of confidence against us," Michael Jordan said the 
other day. "Because they know that they may have certain stronger points than 
we have, and they know they can go to them at any time and win the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons have guards Joe Dumars and Isiah Thomas, forward James Edwards and 
Laimbeer, not to mention a strong corps of reserves. All signs strongly point 
to the Pistons returning to the NBA finals in June. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's recent run has been remarkable, an eight-week stretch in which 
they've stormed to the league's best record. Before Thursday night's 115-110 
loss in Houston, they'd won 12 straight, one short of the string they ripped 
off before losing in Atlanta Feb. 23. During the second run the Pistons beat 
Chicago (twice), Phoenix, San Antonio, New York, Utah, Atlanta and 
Philadelphia. That's a good chunk of the contenders list. 
</P>
<P>
Six more victories would have put the Pistons in select company. Four teams 
(the Rochester Royals, Philadelphia Warriors, New York Knicks and Boston 
Celtics) won 18 straight, and the Milwaukee Bucks and old Washington Capitols 
won 20 in a row. The all-time record is the Lakers' 33 straight from November 
1971 to January 1972. 
</P>
<P>
But the streak wasn't the thing. It's the way Detroit is taking good teams 
apart, at every venue. 
</P>
<P>
For motivation, there's the repeat notion. The Pistons are ahead of their pace 
of last season, when they went 63-19 and lost only two of 17 playoff games. It 
also helps that Los Angeles is on their heels for the best record in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
But, often the Pistons have forgotten about the opponent and figuratively 
played against themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's good to do that," said Dumars. "Sometimes it's not. With this 
team here you just have to play good basketball. But if you get caught up in 
that (playing against the game), you can get in trouble. We just concentrate on 
what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Lakers Coach Pat Riley often uses the book "The Art of War" to explain the 
mindset of his team during the past decade. The Pistons make no such analogies. 
They just shut down opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I read that (book) when (his son) was a kid," said Chuck Daly, the Pistons 
coach who has pushed all the right buttons of late. 
</P>
<P>
Two major factors have been at play. Edwards, who replaced John Salley at 
starting power forward early in the season, has been a stabilizer in the front 
court, allowing Laimbeer to drift out to the foul line and higher to set picks 
or shoot jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
And Dennis Rodman became a starter when Mark Aguirre hurt his back in a Jan. 21 
loss to the Lakers. That's when the Pistons started their run. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Pistons already were leading the league in fewest points allowed 
when the streak began, they've shaved almost a full point off that average, to 
an even 97 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents are shooting a league-low .443. The Pistons have held teams under 100 
points this season a league-high 37 times. And Detroit has won 30 games by 10 
points or more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much their quickness out front," Washington guard Darrell Walker 
said, referring to Dumars and Thomas. "Those guys are talented. They're going 
to score some points. I don't care who's guarding them. But I think their 
defense is what's really the key to their basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get in the playoffs, you've got to stop people in a half-court game, 
and they can stop you. Because they're big and they step over and they're 
aggressive and they bump you when you go through the lane. They bump you every 
chance they can bump you. And I think that's what separates them from the rest 
of the teams in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say, " 'God, I have to go out there and work, work, work. I don't 
want to do that,' " Rodman said. "That's an advantage for me." 
</P>
<P>
Now Detroit has the luxury of choosing to go strictly for offense off the bench 
(Aguirre and Vinnie Johnson), or a combination (Aguirre and Salley). Or, as 
they did in the fourth quarter against Chicago last week, the Pistons can still 
go for the full defensive look, leaving Rodman, Dumars and Edwards in with 
Salley. That group, with Johnson, blew out the Bulls in Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the rush to get on their charter, Roundball One, and get out of 
town. The Pistons are always in a hurry to get to the next game, to get another 
one under their belts and get closer to the playoffs. No music in the locker 
room. Just their trainer, Mike Abdenour, screaming, "Let's go, let's go!" every 
eight seconds or so. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't worry about (other people)," Daly said. "We just do what we do. We 
have a lot of guys who like to compete, like to get out and play. That's all it 
is, is hard work."

EMPIRE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;

ESPERANZA SHOWS SIGNS OF RECOVERY

<P>
No one is ready to say that the Esperanza High School baseball program has 
returned to glory. Not yet anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But judging by Friday's performance, there are a few Empire League coaches who 
might be concerned that the Aztecs are indeed back. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza defeated Loara, 12-1, behind a 15-hit attack at Loara. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting better every week," Esperanza Coach Mike Curran said. "But I 
don't think you can compare us to the great teams we've had in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's better than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs made three consecutive appearances in the Southern Section 
championship game. They won the title in 1986 and finished second the following 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
But Esperanza slipped last season and kept slipping. 
</P>
<P>
"I've blotted last season from my mind," Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs finished 10-11-1 last season, 4-10-1 in league play. That was good 
for fifth place, the team's worst showing under Curran. 
</P>
<P>
But those days may be behind Esperanza, which returned three starters from the 
1989 team. The Aztecs are 7-2, 3-0 in league play and tied for first with Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can judge anything by three games," Curran said. "But we 
seem to be executing a lot better this season. We're doing the little things, 
like moving runners over and hitting behind runners. We have some concerns 
about the pitching, but today, we put everything together -- the hitting and 
pitching." 
</P>
<P>
The Saxons (2-8, 1-2) can testify to that. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Loara didn't help itself with five errors and four wild pitches. 
However, Esperanza really didn't need the help. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Redington led Esperanza with four hits. The Aztecs had four extra-base 
hits, including a grand slam by Greg Hauser -- the No. 9 batter in the order. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 1-1, after two innings, but Esperanza scored two in the 
third and two in the fourth. Redington singled and scored in the third, then 
doubled home a run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Hauser had the big hit in a five-run fifth, driving a 2-2 pitch over the 
354-foot sign in left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
"This was by far our best showing offensively this season," Curran said. "We 
seemed to get a hit every time we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
Shade Summers (4-0) allowed six hits, three of which came in the second inning 
when the Griffins scored their only run. 
</P>
<P>
Redington went the final two innings, striking out three. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Katella 11, Cypress 8 -- Danny Allen had a grand slam and a double to lead 
Katella (2-1, 7-3) at Cypress. Kevin Smith had three hits, including two 
doubles, for Cypress (0-3, 1-9). 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 10, El Dorado 6 -- Anthony Napolitano had three hits, including a

EBY NEEDS NO ADVICE TO COMPLETE 6-2 WIN OVER THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't bother Mike Eby when he's on the mound. Just let him pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Eby, a senior left-hander for Westlake High, didn't appreciate Coach Rich 
Herrera's visit in the bottom of the seventh inning of a Marmonte League game 
at Thousand Oaks on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And Herrera didn't appreciate his 6-foot-2 pitcher not appreciating it. 
</P>
<P>
Without anyone's advice, Eby had coasted for six innings as Westlake built a 
four-run lead. But when Eby walked Bryan Corey on five pitches to begin the 
seventh, Herrera went to the mound and an exchange of clearly audible 
expletives ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Eby, in effect, told Herrera to beat it. Herrera, not in so many four-letter 
words, told Eby to shut up and throw strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Eby did. Six pitches later, after a double play and a game-ending popup, Eby 
(3-0) had what he wanted: his third complete-game victory as Westlake (9-0, 3-0 
in league play) moved into sole possession of first place with a 6-2 win. 
</P>
<P>
Shuffling a changeup and curve, Eby dealt Thousand Oaks (5-1, 2-1) its first 
loss with a three-hitter. He worked rapidly, making only 86 pitches. He struck 
out three and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't trying to give (Herrera) lip," Eby said. "I just wanted to tell him 
that I know what my job is and I'm going to throw strikes. I was throwing 
strikes for six innings. I must have been doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Said Herrera: "He didn't want me out there. It's like he gets in a groove and I 
might have gotten in his way." 
</P>
<P>
Eight times Eby needed only one pitch to retire a batter. His only mistake was 
a high fastball to Lance Martin, who drove it over the center-field fence in 
the second for his second homer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks scored its other run in the third on a throwing error by Westlake 
second baseman Rick Wolters that allowed Brian Capella to dash home from 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"He has great control of his pitches," said Martin, who was one for two with a 
walk. "He had control of everything he threw." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake tagged three Thousand Oaks pitchers for 11 hits, including six off 
starter Scott Barkman (2-1), who gave up four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake scored a run in the first on a leadoff triple by Rob Neal and a single 
by Tim Falsken. Run-scoring singles by Sean Howard and Keenan McAluney keyed a 
three-run fourth inning. In the fifth, Keith Hess hit a two-run home run off 
reliever Mike Lee.

CSUN VOLLEYBALL TEAM FINDS NO ROOM AT TOP AGAINST USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was nothing to lose and a lot to gain for the Cal State Northridge men's 
volleyball team against USC on Friday night in a Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball match at USC's Lyon Center. 
</P>
<P>
But about all that Northridge gained was more respect for USC, which came into 
the match as the nation's top-ranked team in the latest Tachikara coaches' 
poll. The Trojans swept the Matadors, 15-13, 15-9, 15-7, in a match televised 
live on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good team," Northridge middle blocker Coley Kyman said of USC. "They 
played well. We couldn't get any breaks." 
</P>
<P>
USC, which improved to 14-1 and 10-1 in conference play, maintained its 
one-game advantage in the WIVA's Wilson Division over Long Beach State (9-2), 
which beat Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
For the sixth-ranked Matadors, positioned comfortably in second place in the 
WIVA's DeGroot Division, the match wasn't as crucial. With five WIVA matches 
remaining, Northridge (11-8, 6-5) cannot catch division-leading UCLA (12-2), 
but is well ahead of third-place Pepperdine (4-9). 
</P>
<P>
The top three teams in each division will advance to the conference tournament 
and the tournament champion will receive the conference's automatic berth into 
the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"(The match) really doesn't mean much in terms of standings," Northridge Coach 
John Price said. "The most important thing to gain from this match was 
experience. We're probably going to meet them again in the tournament. That's 
when it counts." 
</P>
<P>
USC dominated the match early, building a 6-0 lead before Kyman registered the 
first Matador point. Northridge battled back, tied the game at 11-11, then went 
ahead, 13-11, on Gary Reznick's dink shot before giving up four unanswered 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"After we went up 13-11, we just broke down," Kyman said. "I think that set the 
tone for the rest of the match." 
</P>
<P>
Price agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We were close," Price said, "but they just played unbelievable defense that 
kept them in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge broke a 6-6 tie and held a 9-6 advantage in the second game before 
USC reeled off nine points in a row, primarily on the hitting of Bryan Ivie and 
the blocking of Dan Greenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
Ivie had 21 kills while Greenbaum had seven blocks. Kevin Shepard and Jason 
Perkins chipped in with 15 and 13 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Coffman led Northridge with 19 kills. Kyman and Raphael Tulino, who 
recorded two service aces, had 17 and 14 each.

NORTHRIDGE GIRL BREAKS SWIM MARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kristine Quance, a 14-year-old Northridge girl, set national and Southern 
California age-group records in the U. S. Swimming Senior National Short Course 
championships, which concluded Friday in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Quance broke Tracy Caulkins' national record in the 13-14-year-olds' 200-yard 
breaststroke Tuesday with a time of two minutes, 15.61 seconds, good for sixth 
place overall in the meet, open to swimmers aged 11 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
Caulkins set the previous mark of 2:15.86 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Quance, a freshman at Granada Hills High, also set Southern California age 
13-14 records in the 200 individual medley and the 400 IM. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, she won the 13-14 200 IM with a time of 2:02.44, good for fifth 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Quance broke the Southern California record with a 4:16.76 in the 400 IM 
Thursday, winning her age group and finishing fifth overall. 
</P>
<P>
Quance was the only representative of the Valley Aquatics Swim Team at the meet 
but still swam well enough to finish 22nd in the girls' team standings. 
</P>
<P>
Former Cal State Northridge swimmer Jeff Kubiak placed in both breaststroke 
events at the open U. S. Swimming Short Course championships, also in 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
Kubiak, swimming for Austin, Tex.-based Longhorn Aquatics, was second in the 
200 breaststroke Tuesday at 1:58.24, and fourth in the 100 breaststroke 
Thursday with a 54.92.

SAILING: LIBBIE KAMISUGI HOPES TO BECOME THE FIRST WOMAN TO ENTER THE 
MALE-DOMINATED WORLD OF AMERICA'S CUP RACING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since she was 12, Libbie Kamisugi had dreamed of making an ocean crossing 
in a sailboat. Now she is on the verge of making a historic crossing, entering 
the male-dominated world of America's Cup racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, it was beyond my vision," Kamisugi said Friday afternoon on board the 
12-meter America II in San Diego Bay. "I never thought I'd have the 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a week before Philip Freedman, chief executive officer of the Betsy 
Ross group, announces his choice of skipper for the syndicate's entry. But 
Freedman has made it clear that Honolulu's Kamisugi is the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
"I have files on five women," Freedman said. "We looked at all the best 
professional women, and we felt because it will be the first time a woman 
skippers an America's Cup boat, we had to have the most experienced one." 
</P>
<P>
Kamisugi has finished three Los Angeles-to-Honolulu TransPac races, finishing 
second in her class last year and fourth overall in 1983. She has sailed in 
many major regattas and was one of the first International Offshore Rule racers 
to receive major sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman said Kamisugi is well-suited to handle the heavy scrutiny the first 
female skipper in America's Cup competition would most likely face. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to be put under a microscope," Freedman said, "but she's not 
intimidated. She'll be one tough cookie." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman is being scrutinized already. Critics say he's trying to attract 
greater sponsorship, and publicity, by fielding a boat skippered by a woman and 
with several female crew members. 
</P>
<P>
"People say we're doing it to get sponsors, but so far, our sponsors aren't for 
women's products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman notified Kamisugi six weeks ago of his intention to have a woman on 
one of his boats -- the Betsy Ross group plans to race two -- for the 1992 
America's Cup. She was quick to tell him she wasn't interested in a crew 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"She said to me, 'I'm not a crew member, I'm a driver,' " Freedman said. "I 
like that she's not petite and quiet like you think she is." 
</P>
<P>
But petite she is. At 5-feet-4, 115 pounds, Kamisugi said she even hopes to 
shed a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely strong for my size," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kamisugi said he began lifting weights as the result of a conversation she 
overheard in the early 1970s. Before she made her first TransPac crossing, she 
was bothered when she heard a sailor talking about the dangers of a woman 
competing in such a race. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd never take a girl on TransPac," Kamisugi said. "He said he could 
just see himself falling overboard, and this little fragile hand with finger 
polish is going to pull him out? 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that. I said to myself that I'm going to be as strong as I can be 
because that could happen. If you weren't strong enough to hold onto someone, 
they could die. I took that very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
While she does have polish, it's in her sailing and not just her nails. 
</P>
<P>
Said one crew member on board America II: "I've followed her career for five 
years now, and she's good." 
</P>
<P>
The Betsy Ross will be the first time a U.S. boat in the America's Cup will be 
named after a woman. Freedman said he came up with the name when he considered 
Ross' role in the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a first," Kamisugi said. "Provided the performance is good, it'll show 
that women aren't really disadvantaged in certain positions on sailboats. I 
think there's a place for men on boats, but there's a place for women, too." 
</P>
<P>
Kamisugi grew up in Chicago and began sailing in small boats on Lake Michigan 
when she was 11. At 15, she won her first championship against men. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never raced with or against women, I've always raced with and against 
men," she said. "I grew up with a mixed identity. I didn't know I wasn't 
supposed to do those things. My father always told me there wasn't anything I 
couldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
Neither is Kamisugi as serene as she appears to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a very pushy leader," she said. "I speak softly, but it's not that I 
don't take control. I do, but I run a democratic ship compared to many." 
</P>
<P>
Kamisugi traces her reputation to tenacity and a willingness to learn from 
those around her. When she first started sailing big boats in Honolulu, she 
challenged herself to sail the short distance to the island of Hawaii and not 
get sick. She accomplished that goal in part. 
</P>
<P>
"I got good at being sick," she said. "I kept doing it until I got used to 
getting sick. It's not like I don't have the same problems as other people do 
(at sea), it's just a willingness to stick out there and suffer." 
</P>
<P>
And she isn't too proud to surround herself with experts and learn from them. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever possible," she said, "I will take on board my boat the very best 
sailors I can get. I welcome their input. I try to profit from their experience 
so when I get off, I'm better than when I got on."

DAVE DISTEL: PROFESSORS GWYNN, CLARK GIVE CARTER NATIONAL LEAGUE LESSONS 
</P>

<P>
Joe Carter swung and lifted a high fly ball to center field. Tony Gwynn watched 
from right as the ball landed harmlessly a few feet short of the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
"Home run in Cleveland," Gwynn cackled. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, caught off guard, laughed so hard he had to step out of the batter's 
box. 
</P>
<P>
He stepped back in, still chuckling, and hit the next pitch deep to left. 
Again, it fell just short of the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
"Home run in Boston," Carter yelled. 
</P>
<P>
And Gwynn cackled again. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no Clevelands or Bostons for Joe Carter in 1990. This is a year 
of adjustment to a new team and a new league for the man the Padres obtained in 
the off-season trade that sent Sandy Alomar Jr. to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a few games with the Chicago Cubs at the end of the 1983 
season, Carter has been a career American Leaguer. He knows where to go for 
seafood in American League cities, how baseballs bounce off the walls in 
American League parks and what American League pitchers are likely to throw him 
when they are behind in the count. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, he finds himself in a different world. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always looking for good restaurants," he said. "Any suggestions?" 
</P>
<P>
But restaurants are not exactly at the top of his list. Carter's idea of a 
feast is a fastball down the middle or maybe a hanging curve. And he wants to 
know what each pitcher is likely to feed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have a little advantage," he said, "because I have Tony Gwynn and 
Jack Clark to talk to. I want to find out how they pitch to Jack. And Tony 
knows pitchers like a book." 
</P>
<P>
Carter will learn different things from Gwynn than he will from Clark. He will 
learn what a pitcher throws from Gwynn and where it is likely to be thrown from 
Clark, the reason being that pitchers approach guys such as Carter and Clark 
differently than they approach Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys," Gwynn said, "are threats. Make a mistake with those guys, and 
it's out of the park. Make a mistake with me, and I hit maybe a single to left 
field." 
</P>
<P>
So how might Mr. Gwynn be of some help? 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest advantage you can have as a hitter is to know the pitchers," he 
said. "You need to know what a pitcher throws when he's behind in the count, 
what he throws when he's ahead in the count, what he throws when he has to make 
a pitch. It helps to have an idea what you might see." 
</P>
<P>
When, I wondered, would they begin talking about specific pitchers? That 
opening day date with the Dodgers, after all, is only a little more than two 
weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
"Start?" Gwynn said. "We've already gone over the whole Dodger staff. 
Hershiser. Belcher. Wetteland. All of 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who has considerable experience in both leagues, has very good news for 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gonna see a lot more fastballs," Clark said. "He's a good fastball 
hitter, so that should be right up his alley. He's a perfect fit for this 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn nodded his head. 
</P>
<P>
"When we see American League teams in spring training," he said, "we see more 
breaking balls than we do in our league. The pitcher gets behind 2 and 0 and he 
throws a changeup or a curve. Pitchers get behind in our league, and you'll 
usually see something hard." 
</P>
<P>
That, to a power hitter like Carter, is a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Carter's concern for pitchers is likely mirrored by pitchers' 
concern for Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go up there thinking so much I forget to swing," he said. "I'd 
like to think they're doing some thinking about me." 
</P>
<P>
There is certainly cause for pitchers to be a bit worried about Joe Carter. The 
man has averaged 31 home runs and 108 runs batted in over the past four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"He's wearing the same color I'm wearing . . . and I'm glad," said Bruce Hurst, 
who faced Carter when he was pitching in Boston. "He used to come into Fenway 
Park and just tear the place down." 
</P>
<P>
While Carter is picking Gwynn's brain about Dodger pitchers, the Dodger 
pitchers will be picking the brains of people such as Jay Howell, who played 
against Carter in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be really leery," Clark said. "He's such a dangerous hitter 
that they will be very careful what they give him." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so maybe he won't see as many fastballs as he might like. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, position in the batting order will have a lot to say about that. 
Carter and Clark will undoubtedly bat fourth and fifth, the fourth guy getting 
many more pitches to hit than the fifth. Manager Jack McKeon has not made up 
his mind yet, but Carter's speed makes him a logical choice to bat ahead of, 
rather than behind, the slower Clark. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Carter himself seems totally delighted with everything about his 
new league, team and home. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," he said, "from what I've heard, only about 40 billion people would like 
to move to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
And . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I hear Jack Murphy Stadium is a great place to hit."

It's hard to say what will generate the most excitement at tonight's 2-A/3-A 
All-Star boys' basketball game at Serra High. Will it be the players' 
performances or 3-A Coach John Farrell's attempts to work 16 bodies into the 
32-minute game? 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, 2-A Coach Dennis Kane of San Diego High selected just 11 players 
for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going into this game to showcase the kids," said Farrell, coach at 
Torrey Pines. "We're not cutting anybody. Who am I to cut a kid? They've all 
earned the right to be here. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main thing is to get them all in. If we win the game, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Four of Farrell's players no longer need showcasing. Monte Vista's Joe McNaull 
(San Diego State), Shane Knight (Brigham Young) and Kyle Armstrong (Navy) have 
signed with Division I schools, and J.J. Stokes has signed with UCLA to play 
football. 
</P>
<P>
The other 12 are looking for someone to take a flyer on them. 
</P>
<P>
Only two 2-A players, Dee Boyer (Lamar) and Tony Clark (Arizona), have their 
college plans finalized. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' game begins at 7 p.m. The girls' game is scheduled for 5 p.m. DAVE

DANIELS: HEART TESTS SHOW NO TROUBLE

<P>
Kal Daniels said Friday a series of tests detected no trouble with his heart, 
and he plans to join the Dodgers on the field Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I feel great," the outfielder said from his Warner Robins, Ga., home 
after undergoing nine hours of tests at an Atlanta clinic Friday. "The doctors 
told me the only problem I had was that some of the muscles in my heart were 
overdeveloped, something like that, something real complicated. But they told 
me I don't need any medication. They said I don't need to worry about anything. 
I'm ready to play ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers refused to confirm such results Friday, saying the results had yet 
to be interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting a group of people together to look at the results. . . . I 
can't get that information out of there yet," said Dr. Michael Mellman, Dodger 
team internist and one of Hank Gathers' physicians before the Loyola Marymount 
basketball star died March 4. "As soon as the final determination is made, we 
will discuss it with Kal and issue a full statement." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said the Dodgers were cautious because their Los Angeles cardiologists 
had yet to examine the results. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors said they weren't announcing it because they wanted to clear it 
through all of their channels," Daniels said. "But they told me I was fine, and 
that's all I needed to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said he would begin the 10-hour drive to Dodgertown Friday night and 
would miss today's workout because of his late arrival. Mellman said the 
Dodgers were aware that Daniels was driving to camp, and he admitted that if 
the results had been negative, Daniels may not have been allowed to travel. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had knowledge of something terrible, he would have been immediately 
directed toward more tests or treatment," Mellman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I was ready to play a couple of days ago," Daniels said. "It was them 
who said I couldn't. Then when I got in there for the tests, doctors said a lot 
of athletes are being forced to go through this because of what happened to 
Hank Gathers." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, 26, underwent Friday's exam -- which included a treadmill test and 
echocardiogram to determine heart structure -- because of an irregularity 
discovered during a treadmill test Monday in Atlanta. Daniels said that at the 
first exam, "they told me I had an irregular heartbeat, and that it was 
probably no big deal, but they just wanted to be safe rather than sorry." 
</P>
<P>
If Daniels' biggest worries indeed are just his knees, prayers would have been 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been hoping and praying for the man," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If Daniels' surgically repaired right knee allows him to play on opening day as 
he claims, that will make things easier on the Dodger outfield. Having lost 
Kirk Gibson perhaps until May, Lasorda will play Daniels in left field and 
could even bat him leadoff, considering Daniels' career .407 on-base percentage 
is second only to Boston's Wade Boggs' mark among active players. Daniels has a 
career .302 batting average in four seasons, with 77 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda's physique is in jeopardy. Lasorda has learned that his right knee 
requires major surgery, yet he said will not undergo an operation. Thus, he 
will no longer be able to run, and even his daily walks around National League 
cities have been placed in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"No operations for me, man," Lasorda said after learning the results of 
Thursday morning's X-rays. "These knees have done me fine so far, and I'll keep 
living with them." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda admits that he could have trouble maintaining his weight, which dropped 
last season from 218 to 178 in a highly publicized diet. But he said he would 
think of something. 
</P>
<P>
"I can always ride a bike," Lasorda said. "Or, I could just stop eating." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said his knee problems are a result of constant use. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I told the doctor, if you had a truck pounding on its wheels for 62 
years, don't you think after a while it would need new wheels?" Lasorda said. 
"But I'll be fine. I'll live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Four days into spring training and one of Fred Claire's off-season 
rehabilitation projects is hurting. Pat Perry, signed from the Chicago Cubs 
despite rotator cuff shoulder surgery, felt pain Friday after throwing off a 
mound Thursday for the first time since his operation on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like a toothache," said Perry, who officials hoped would compete for 
the left-handed reliever's spot after compiling a 1.77 ERA in 35 2/3 innings 
for Chicago last season. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said he threw for 12 minutes, which may have been too much. But he said 
he couldn't help himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The competitive nature in an athlete kills you," Perry said. "I get here, I 
see all these other guys winging the ball. I think, 'Why can't I do this?' and 
then I try to do it." 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head. "Oh well. I guess one day I will be winging it again." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Strasser, Dodger assistant trainer, said Perry's soreness could be a 
byproduct of a three-week spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what happens in a short camp," Strasser said. "We have been telling 
the players to be careful and Tommy (Lasorda) tells them to be careful, but in 
general, a lot of players just don't understand their bodies enough." 
</P>
<P>
Perry's condition will be evaluated daily. Jay Howell, another reliever, also 
is ailing. He received an injection in his left knee Thursday for bursitis and 
felt better Friday.

GEORGIA TECH BEATS CLOCK (?), MICHIGAN STATE IN OVERTIME

<P>
A fraction of an inch, a tick of the clock. One went against Georgia Tech, one 
went against Michigan State, and Friday night's NCAA Southeast Regional 
semifinal went into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
That was fine with Georgia Tech forward Dennis Scott, who sank a shot nobody 
contested and brought the Yellow Jackets to the doorstep of the Final Four with 
an 81-80 victory at the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
Scott decided an emotional, intense game by driving past Michigan State forward 
Dwayne Stephens across the lane and hitting a hanging seven-foot shot with 
seven seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets (27-6) nearly won the game in regulation on a shot at the 
buzzer by freshman guard Kenny Anderson. Anderson launched the shot with 
Michigan State holding a 75-73 lead, but when the ball swished through the 
hoop, only questions remained. 
</P>
<P>
Did Anderson release his shot inside or outside the three-point line? 
</P>
<P>
Did Anderson release the shot before time expired? 
</P>
<P>
Anderson earned a split decision. Officials ruled that Anderson's right foot 
touched the three-point line -- making the shot worth two points -- and 
determined that the shot beat the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Result: A 75-75 tie and another five minutes of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In that overtime, Scott would get the time to cast the winning shot, but 
Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote argued that he never should have had the 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the game in regulation but lost the game in overtime," Heathcote said. 
</P>
<P>
Heathcote said he didn't believe Anderson's shot beat the buzzer, but his main 
complaint concerned the official timekeeping during the preceding moments. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson had pulled Georgia Tech to within 75-73 with six seconds left in 
regulation. Michigan State inbounded the ball and Smith was fouled with five 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Heathcote contended that, in reality, three or four seconds were left. 
</P>
<P>
"We inbounded the ball and held the ball for two or three seconds," Heathcote 
said, "and we look up at the clock and only one second's run off. We were 
incredulous, jumping up and down on the bench. I don't even know who I can 
appeal to." 
</P>
<P>
When Smith missed the front end of a one-and-one free-throw situation, Georgia 
Tech rebounded and had five seconds to get the ball to Anderson for a mad rush 
down the court. 
</P>
<P>
At four or three seconds, Anderson doesn't have enough time to get off a shot, 
Heathcote said. 
</P>
<P>
Even at five seconds, Heathcote wasn't sure the shot beat the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
"The buzzer here, you can't hear it over the crowd," Heathcote said. "They have 
a little tiny buzzer. If I can't hear the buzzer, how are (the officials) going 
to hear it with A-1 noise?" 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, of course, sided with the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I beat the buzzer," he said. "I know that for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech Bobby Cremins was quick to fall in line with that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw it up and the official was right there -- 'Touchdown!' " Cremins 
said. "I didn't understand the controversy. The shot was definitely good." 
</P>
<P>
When the officials concurred, Cremins could live with the two-point ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me, 'The basket counts, but it's only good for two,' " Cremins said. 
"I accepted that, because I felt we could beat them in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State (28-6) took a 78-77 lead in overtime on a three-point basket by 
guard Steve Smith, who finished with a game-high 32 points. Anderson came back 
to hit a 12-foot running jump shot, putting Georgia Tech ahead, 79-78, with 
1:07 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans regained the lead on two free throws by Stephens with 23 seconds 
left, before Scott delivered the game-winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who ended with 18 points, sank the shot with seven seconds on the clock. 
But Michigan State didn't call timeout until four seconds were left. The 
Spartans inbounded the ball to Smith, who began dribbling downcourt with his 
head down, not picking up Heathcote's frantic signal for a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Those seconds proved critical. When play resumed, Michigan State had only time 
for a hurried 35-foot shot by Ken Redfield over two Yellow Jacket defenders. 
</P>
<P>
A little more time might have meant a much better shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We wasted (three) seconds there," Heathcote said. "I was yelling, 'Timeout, 
timeout.' I don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike regulation, the clock ran out too quickly for Heathcote in overtime.

LIONS REFUSE TO LET SHIP BE GROUNDED

He comes to America from an empire far, far away -- OK, Sweden -- bearing a 
name that definitely belongs inside a spaceship alongside Luke Skywalker and 
Han Solo and Princess Leia, yet it was an utter coincidence that Per Stumer 
picked a particular film to identify with after Loyola Marymount's 
spine-tingling escape Friday night, after overthrowing the Men of Wimp. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like 'Star Wars,' " Stumer said. "It's like there's some Force out there, 
looking out for us." 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, it is. Somebody obviously has sprinkled a little stardust on these 
Loyolans, giving them some dumb luck to go along with the hustle and bravery 
and skill that already had carried them this far. Because, as anyone who saw 
this NCAA West Regional game could plainly see, Wimp Sanderson's Alabama 
slama-jamas did everything a basketball team could do to stop Loyola Marymount 
-- and still couldn't stop it. 
</P>
<P>
The score was 62-60, Lions over Crimson Tide, in a game played at what the 
winners considered to be warped-speed. Slow. Much too slow. So slow, Stumer 
said, "It was like learning how to walk." So slow, that for the Lions to score 
as many points as they did five days before against Michigan, they probably 
would have had to play another 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, with a measly 22 points on the scoreboard, with Alabama's 
defenders having plastered themselves so close to the Lions that they appeared 
to be dirty-dancing, Paul Westhead looked his Loyola players in the eye and 
sent them back out with a rallying cry that is not destined to go down with the 
great pep talks of the ages. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, guys," Westhead said, "we only need 104 more points to get our average." 
</P>
<P>
Funny team, this Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
So funny, it might just laugh all the way to the NCAA Final Four in Denver next 
week -- you know, explore the Final Four frontier, go where no Westchester team 
has gone before. We don't know why any team would dare run with them ever again 
after seeing what happened here Friday, nor do we know how the high altitude of 
Colorado might affect the way they play, but we do know that the Lions have 
seen the future, and they are still in it. 
</P>
<P>
FULFILL THE DREAM, someone scribbled on the locker-room blackboard before the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Within five minutes of the end of the game, a Loyola man had picked up a piece 
of chalk and altered the message. Now it read: 
</P>
<P>
FULFILLING THE DREAM. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, leave it to a Loyola player to say that he would prefer to play 
Nevada Las Vegas, a school that has turned out dozens of NBA stars, than play 
Ball State, a school that has turned out David Letterman and the guy who draws 
the comic strip of Garfield the cat. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to play Ball State," Jeff Fryer said. "Let's play Vegas. I don't 
ever want to play another game like this one." 
</P>
<P>
What Alabama did took nerve. Nobody wants to slow things down to defeat a 
regional tournament's 11th seed. No major university wants to kowtow to the 
style of some little Catholic academy with 3,500 students. Nobody in the Final 
Four is likely to alter its style once it has gotten so far. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Loyola will be off and running again against UNLV come Sunday. 
No more of these 60-point things. Off they go, back into the 100s. 
</P>
<P>
And there are no more truly intimidating, skyscraper centers left in the NCAA 
tournament, no Alonzo Mourning or Derrick Coleman to soar above the 
little-bitty Lions under the basket. Sometimes it seems as though Per Stumer is 
the only guy Loyola has who isn't built like a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
The junior packs 210 pounds on a 6-7 frame, and throws it around pretty good. 
He was actually laughing -- laughing -- in the face of Alabama's 6-8 Melvin 
Cheatum, daring him to shoot, trying to needle him into doing something foolish 
with the basketball, after Cheatum had been instructed by Sanderson to hold it 
as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Stumer has this great, ear-to-ear smile, and a retainer that he pops in and out 
of his mouth from minute to minute. It is his responsibility to haul down some 
of the rebounds that Hank Gathers used to get, even though he is clearly a 
forward, not a center. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, he did exactly that. Stumer got 12 rebounds, more than anybody on 
the floor. Six of them were on offense. And one of them came in the final 
minute, an absolute season-saver. When Fryer missed, Stumer lassoed the ball 
and fed it right back to Fryer, whose three-pointer put Loyola ahead, 60-58. 
Hey, when the Force is with you, the Force is with you. "We're getting to be a 
pretty fantastic story," Stumer said. "Don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
Science fiction, kid. Science fiction.

UNLV ESCAPES BALL STATE, 69-67, WILL PLAY LOYOLA NEXT

That comfortable lead Nevada Las Vegas had from the start Friday night turned 
suddenly, excruciatingly uncomfortable for the Rebels with less than two 
minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
That was when Ball State's Billy Butts went up for a three-point shot and made 
it, cutting UNLV's lead to three points. A little more than 30 seconds earlier, 
Ball State's Chandler Thompson had made a three-point basket. Together, they 
cut a nine-point UNLV lead into three, and together they put second-ranked UNLV 
a big play or two from going home. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV held on for a 69-67 victory in front of 14,262 at the Oakland Coliseum 
Arena in a West Regional semifinal only after UNLV center David Butler 
intercepted a weak lob pass in the middle of the lane from Mike Spicer in the 
final seconds, preventing the Cardinals from getting off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The victory sends UNLV into the final eight for the second year in a row and 
the third time in four years. The Rebels will play Loyola Marymount Sunday for 
the West Regional championship and a trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV defeated Loyola, 102-91, when the teams met early this season. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV (32-5) gave the Cardinals plenty of opportunities to replace the Rebels as 
the team in Sunday's final, missing three of four free throws down the stretch. 
Greg Anthony missed the front end of a one-and-one opportunity twice in the 
final 34 seconds, including one with 18 seconds to play, giving Ball State a 
chance to tie the score or win. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked like we had a pretty good lead there, like we had things pretty much 
under control," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "But it was a game we could 
conceivably have given away at the end." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV led by 11 points midway through the second half, but as it did all game, 
Ball State came back. There was no bigger reason for that than the Cardinals' 
rebounding. Despite being a smaller team, Ball State outrebounded UNLV, 51-36. 
</P>
<P>
"They got some second shots," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon led UNLV with 20 points each. Chandler Thompson 
scored 21 for Ball State, and Paris McCurdy added 17.

Ball State (26-7) ended its run after beating Oregon State and Louisville in 
dramatic games. Of three NCAA tournament games the Cardinals played, none was 
settled until the final minute. One, the Oregon State game, wasn't settled 
until time had expired, when Paris McCurdy made a free throw to complete a 
three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
They came close, too close for UNLV's comfort, to winning a third. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tribute to the heart these kids play with," Ball State Coach Dick 
Hunsaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, Ball State had beaten only one team ranked in the top 25 in 
its history. That was in a 1974 victory over Cincinnati, then ranked 20th. 
After the first and second round of the tournament last week, that total had 
tripled with victories over 22nd-ranked Oregon State and 16th-ranked 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Their two victories marked the first time a Mid-American Conference school had 
won two NCAA games since 1964, when Ohio University beat Louisville and 
Kentucky before losing to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV took a 17-6 lead, but Ball State cut it to three. By halftime, UNLV led 
41-33, despite shooting only 42%. One of the reasons UNLV still led was that 
Ball State made only 10 of 35 shots, or 29%. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State's Curtis Kidd had thought playing against UNLV's inside players 
might be easier than playing against Felton Spencer, Louisville's 7-foot 
center. He found out differently. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd was guarding Larry Johnson in the first half. After 20 minutes, Johnson 
had 16 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 32 of UNLV's 41 first-half points came from inside players, although 
not all of them came from inside -- Johnson got three of his points on one 
shot, a 20-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the Rebels had little trouble getting the ball inside, they 
missed 10 shots in the lane in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the blowout predicted by many. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people told me today it would be a blowout," Augmon said. "I told them 
they were wrong."

FOR O'MARA AND WARD, ROSE BOWL RIDE IS TRIP INTO PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johnny O'Mara and Jeff Ward are the old guard of motocross at 28. They are old 
enough to remember what racing was like five years ago when O'Mara won the 
Supercross at the Rose Bowl, and Ward won the American Motorcyclist Assn. 
stadium series championship the same night. 
</P>
<P>
The Kawasaki teammates will be the only riders left from the 1985 event who 
will race tonight when the Camel Supercross series returns to the Rose Bowl for 
the 20-lap Coors Extra Gold Super Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it was five years ago," O'Mara said. "I remember it like it 
was last year. Winning was easier back then. About the only ones who figured to 
win were David Bailey, Wardy, RJ (Rick Johnson) and myself. Nowadays there are 
so many guys, it makes it tough to even finish up close." 
</P>
<P>
O'Mara, who will turn 29 Sunday, was born in Pasadena and lives in Simi Valley. 
He won five races and the Supercross championship in 1984, but his last stadium 
victory came in the '85 Rose Bowl race. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm older and wiser, and I think I'm riding as good as ever," he said, 
"but if you don't get off the line quick and stay out of trouble, you're not 
going to have a chance against all the new guys coming up. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week (in Las Vegas), I rode really well and finished seventh. I'm looking 
forward to riding in the Rose Bowl again. The course the Mickey Thompson people 
laid out seems to be a good one, and maybe Pasadena will be good luck for me." 
</P>
<P>
Ward, the Supercross champion in 1985 and '87, won in the Rose Bowl in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference is that a few years ago there were so few top riders that I 
could ride injured and still finish in the top five, maybe even second," Ward 
said. "Now it's a struggle to get in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
He rode in pain most of last season after injuring his foot during practice for 
the season opener at Anaheim. Ward missed the first five races but returned to 
win the national 500cc championship and become the first rider in motocross 
history to win championships in all four major AMA series. 
</P>
<P>
From Mission Viejo, he won the national 250cc in 1985 and '88 and the 125cc in 
'84 to go with his 500cc and Supercross titles. 
</P>
<P>
Ward is seventh in the standings this season with a victory in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Matiasevich, a rookie Kawasaki rider from La Habra Heights, is leading 
with 134 points, to 120 for defending series champion Jeff Stanton, a Honda 
factory rider.

UMPIRES TO PROTEST, SKIP SPRING TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Major league umpires, angry because they were not consulted about the revised 
regular-season schedule, said Friday they would protest by not working spring 
training games. 
</P>
<P>
Richie Phillips, head of the umpires' union, called it "a very, very symbolic 
protest." He said its intent was to prod owners to resolve differences over 
compensation for canceled exhibition games and other matters arising from the 
32-day lockout. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the protest would not affect the regular season and that umpires 
would be ready to work on opening day April 9. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary fight is over the lack of respect on the part of the owners and 
the callous attitude they have toward the umpires," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Gorman, Boston Red Sox general manager, called the umpires' move "hard to 
believe. It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said that he had filed a charge of unfair labor practice with the 
National Labor Relations Board, saying the owners hadn't bargained in good 
faith and changed working conditions without consulting the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
"They are willing to suffer (a) loss of pay for the spring training games in 
order to level this protest with the owners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The union encouraged minor league umpires to work the spring training games, 
which start Monday. Phillips said there would be no picketing at the game 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't consider this a strike," Phillips said. "It's not a boycott. It's a 
refusal on the part of the umpires to be recalled." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Merhige, a spokeswoman for the American League, and Katy Feeney, a 
spokeswoman for the National League, both said "professional" umpires would be 
on hand for Monday's games. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Lawrence, head of minor league umpire development, said his staff was 
"preparing to fill the void." 
</P>
<P>
"Any umpire who is not under major league contract can work," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said he last talked with representatives of the owners Thursday 
afternoon and told Commissioner Fay Vincent of his pending action Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"If they sat down and bargained in good faith we could probably settle in a 
half hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball announced Thursday that it will play a full 162-game schedule, 
extending the season for three days and making up during the year other games 
lost because of the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said this probably meant fewer off days for umpires, who already have 
"onerous" work and travel schedules. He said umpires should be compensated for 
the living expenses they incurred while standing by during the lockout.

RELAY RALLY GIVES TEXAS LEAD OVER USC, 360-291

<P>
Texas extended its lead over USC at the NCAA swimming and diving championships 
when Doug Gjertsen passed Dan Jorgensen in the last leg of the 800-yard 
freestyle relay Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After two days, Texas leads USC, 360-291. Stanford is third with 231 points. 
UCLA is sixth with 175. 
</P>
<P>
Texas led the relay until the 600-yard mark, when Dave Wharton of USC passed 
Matt Stahlman of Texas. Wharton made up more than one second on his leg. But 
Gjertsen was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Gjertsen, who earlier won the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:33.15, caught 
Jorgensen with 100 yards left and held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was confident that I could have swum faster in the relay, but I have a lot 
of swims tomorrow," Gjertsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Texas entered the session with a 17-point lead, but USC overtook the Longhorns 
for the team lead, 204-201, after three events. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton opened the evening by winning the 200-yard medley relay in an NCAA, 
American, and U.S. Open record time of 1:27.31. UCLA finished second, also 
under the old record. 
</P>
<P>
USC made its move in the 400-yard individual medley when Dave Wharton won for 
the third year in a row. Ray Looze, also of USC, was second. Wharton's time of 
3:43.62 was well off his record. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton led by a body length after 100 yards and steadily pulled away. Looze's 
time of 3:47.08 was a lifetime best. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-yard butterfly, Anthony Nesty of Florida pulled away from the field 
to win with a time of 46.62 seconds. Although Shaun Jordan of Texas finished 
second, USC continued to hold an advantage because Erik Ran finished fourth and 
Brad Bailey was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Nesty, who won the 100-meter butterfly at the Seoul Olympics, trailed Ran at 
the 50-yard mark and pulled ahead at 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Trojans' advantage was short lived. Texas won the next two events, 
Gjertsen the 200-yard freestyle and Kirk Stackle the 100-yard breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
In the next event, the three-meter springboard, Donie Scott of Southern 
Methodist defeated Thursday night's one-meter champion Mark Lenzi of Indiana, 
974.55-663.90.

ORANGEMEN WHO CAN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT BEATEN BY MINNESOTA

<P>
Clockwork Orangemen, they weren't. They didn't shoot free throws. They didn't 
get the ball to Derrick Coleman down the stretch. They didn't take care of any 
of the details that should be as automatic as breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse neglected the little things and the little team, turning the Minnesota 
Golden Gophers into the latest giant-killers in the wild and unruly NCAA 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, fourth in the Big Ten Conference, seized the opportunity in a major 
way -- the Gophers shot an astounding 79.2% in the second half -- and upset 
second-seeded Syracuse, 82-75, in the semifinals of the Southeast Regional 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Minnesota (23-8) reached the NCAA's final eight for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
With the defeat, Syracuse (26-7) failed for the third consecutive year to 
return to the Final Four, where it left business unfinished in the 1987 final 
against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's game, the Orangemen were eight minutes from victory. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Coleman disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, consensus All-American and potential No. 1 pick in the 1990 NBA draft, 
didn't shoot during the final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough time for sophomore center Tony Scott (scoring average: 5.5 
points) to get off five shots and miss four of them, including a layup and a 
forced three-pointer, the latter coming with just under a minute to play and 
the Orangemen down, 76-73. 
</P>
<P>
But Coleman, a 6-foot-10 senior with an 18.0 scoring average and 55.8% 
shooting, couldn't find time to get off one shot. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim credited Minnesota's double-team strategy, which 
consisted of 6-6 forward Richard Coffey fronting Coleman and waiting for help. 
</P>
<P>
"They did about the same job most people do in trying to come back and 
double-team him, bump him and push him out," Boeheim said. "It created some 
shot opportunities (for Scott), and I think Tony got some good shots for the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
But not his last shot. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's hurried slingshot barely kicked off the front of the rim and ricocheted 
into Minnesota hands. A quick foul of Gopher guard Kevin Lynch followed, and 
Lynch made both free throws for a 78-73 lead with 32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Another errant three-point shot, this by Syracuse freshman guard Michael 
Edwards, brought another Minnesota rebound, another foul and two more free 
throws by Gopher Walter Bond. 
</P>
<P>
With 24 seconds left, Minnesota had an 80-73 lead and its trip to the final 
eight all but assured. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stunning victory in many ways. Syracuse outrebounded Minnesota, 43-32, 
and had more offensive rebounds -- 24 -- than defensive. During one second-half 
stretch, the Orangemen took 11 shots in three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse also had more free-throw opportunities than Minnesota -- 20-19 -- but 
converted only eight of them. At one point, the Orangemen were four for 15 from 
the foul line. That's 27%. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers made 13 free throws, good for 68%. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Minnesota's shooting: 58.9% for the game, 79.2% for the 
second half. In the final 20 minutes, the Gophers attempted 24 shots and netted 
19 of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventh-nine percent," Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins said as he stared at a 
stat sheet. "I would take that from the free-throw line." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Boeheim would have taken 50% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
But with Syracuse, there is nothing free about these throws. For the season, 
the Orangemen shot just 65.3% as a team, with two regulars, center LeRon Ellis 
(52.1%) and guard Stephen Thompson (50.2%), barely breaking even. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we can do about it," Boeheim said with a shrug. "We've been 
shooting it better lately, but we missed some big ones tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Such missed opportunities played right into the Gophers' hands. Syracuse held 
Minnesota's best player, Willie Burton, in check, limiting him to 12 points, 
but were burned by the Gophers' backcourt. Lynch made seven of 10 shots for 18 
points, and Melvin Newbern was nine for 15 for 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve center Bob Martin added 10 points, sinking four of his five field-goal 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
"We got strong leadership from everybody tonight," Newbern said. "We're not 
just one individual who has to do everything." 
</P>
<P>
Haskins marveled at the defensive accomplishment of Coffey, who gave away four 
inches to Coleman but didn't give up a shot during the last eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Richard's an NBA-caliber player," Haskins said, "and the defensive job 
he did tonight proved that." 
</P>
<P>
That assignment is commonly known as denying your man the ball. Friday night, 
Coffey took it to preposterous extremes.

NICKLAUS CHALLENGED, CHALLENGER AS SENIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are mixed emotions among his fellow golfers as Jack Nicklaus prepares to 
play in his first official tournament on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus will tee off Thursday in the first round of the Tradition at Desert 
Mountain in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a cold reception from some seniors -- especially Dave Hill, 
because of Nicklaus' comments. Some thought he had demeaned the 50-and-over 
group. 
</P>
<P>
But a majority, including Lee Trevino, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Chi Chi 
Rodriguez, welcome Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
The Tradition is one of just three senior events Nicklaus plans to play as a 
"rookie," and his presence has made the field for the 72-hole, $800,000 
tournament the best in the brief history of the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
The tour has grown quietly from two tournaments with a total purse of $250,000 
in 1980 to 42 with almost $18 million in prize money this year. 
</P>
<P>
Then Nicklaus shattered the seniors' serenity, telling Golf Digest he really 
wasn't much interested in joining the old-timers. For one thing, he thought he 
could still win on the regular PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
It was especially upsetting to many when he said: "Fellows who were marginal 
players on the regular tour are now doing quite well as seniors. I don't find 
it a challenge to play against the same guys I've beaten for 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Hill was outraged. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought Jack was quite a guy," Hill said. "I don't any longer. He's 
an . . . I hope that some of us marginal players can hammer him at Scottsdale. 
I'm going to be doing my best. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I'd like to know: Who does Jack consider a marginal player? Is Tom 
Kite (the all-time leading money-winner) a marginal player? I won 12 
tournaments on the regular tour, and so did Kite." 
</P>
<P>
Dave's younger brother, Mike, who won the only senior tournament this year 
Trevino entered and didn't win, said he wasn't much concerned about Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'll play much," Mike Hill said. "But that's all right. We're 
better off having fellows like Lee, who feels he should put something back into 
the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, 60, flashed a knowing smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the same way when I turned 50," he said. "I thought I could still beat 
the juniors. I wasn't ready to admit I couldn't win on the regular tour. Once I 
understood, I have had nothing but fun. It'll happen to Jack, too." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus has said he has a challenge again, adding: "My goal is to be the first 
to win on both tours (in the same year). I don't know why I can't. I feel 
better than I have in years. I really think the exercise program I've been on 
has brought my game back close to where it was 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
He made the statement before he played in his first three events on the regular 
tour this year. At Pebble Beach, he finished at 300, beating only one player 
who made the cut. At Doral, in Florida the first week in March, he shot 289, 
one over par, but still beat only six golfers. He missed the cut in the Players 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino expects a big effort from Nicklaus in the Tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing," Trevino said. "He'll be ready. He said those things 
just to get the seniors riled up. He needs a challenge, and that's what he got. 
</P>
<P>
"You know he'll be ready at Scottsdale. I welcome him. He brings out the best 
in all of us. I seem to play better when he's out there. I'm fortunate that I'm 
at the top of my game right now. I'm looking forward to the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus might have a bit of a home-course advantage, having designed the 
6,837-yard Cochise layout. Last year, the seniors voted it the best-conditioned 
course on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason Nicklaus is playing in the tournament -- which is trying to 
become the seniors' Masters -- is that it does not have a pro-am. One of 
Nicklaus' magazine comments was, "I don't want to play pro-ams on short courses 
with no roughs." 
</P>
<P>
Several seniors were asked if they could remember winning a tournament 
head-to-head from Nicklaus. Most couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I remember," said Al Geiberger, who won 11 events on the 
regular tour and has won five on the senior circuit, "is sitting in the locker 
room and watching on TV as Jack won a tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Littler, who will be 60 in July, had some success against Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
"When I won the Canadian Open in 1965," Littler said, "Jack was a shot ahead of 
me with two or three holes to go, and I caught and passed him. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a three-way playoff in the World Series of Golf in 1966 with 
Nicklaus and Al Geiberger and I won it." 
</P>
<P>
He added facetiously: "I did well against him. I must have beaten him 20 times. 
Come to think of it, I don't think he lost 20 tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez wondered if some of the seniors had forgotten just how good Nicklaus 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the greatest of all time," Rodriguez said. "Actually, he didn't play the 
regular tour. If he had, he would have won 200 tournaments. We shouldn't get 
him upset. You know what a Bear does when he gets angry. He eats you up." 
</P>
<P>
In another recent interview in Golf World, Nicklaus backed off a little in his 
comments on the senior tour but did not retract what he had said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never intended to belittle the tour or the players," Nicklaus told the 
magazine. "They are friends of mine. I have been beating them, but they beat 
me, too. I guess the main problem is I think I can still win on the regular 
tour." 
</P>
<P>
The Tradition will be the start of something for Nicklaus. Throughout his 
career, while his children were young, he never played in more than two 
successive tournaments. But following the Tradition, he'll play in the Masters 
and then the Senior PGA. He will wind up his senior schedule with the Senior 
TPC in June. 
</P>
<P>
After that, his plans might depend on how he fared against his old -- and young 
-- friends.

HOCH SHOOTS 68 TO LEAD AT BAY HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Hoch, playing despite tendinitis in his left hand, shot a four-under-par 
68 Friday to take the second-round lead in the Bay Hill Invitational at 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Hoch had five birdies and a bogey despite "mis-hitting the ball all over the 
place" and was at seven-under-par 137 after two trips around the 7,114-yard 
course. That was a shot better than Jay Don Blake, Larry Nelson, Corey Pavin 
and Billy Andrade. 
</P>
<P>
Blake, in his fourth year on the PGA Tour, had the day's best score, a 66 that 
included eight birdies -- including five in a row starting on the 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Watson, Curtis Strange, Billy Mayfair and Craig Parry were two shots back 
at 139. Mark McCumber, Paul Azinger, Robert Gamez, Nick Price and Kenny Knox 
were at 140. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I'm hitting, I should have missed the cut," said Hoch, a 10-year tour 
veteran with four victories. "I haven't hit a solid long iron yet. . . . I was 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Hoch, who suffered a torn ligament earlier this year, said his hand hurts after 
every swing "but I'm playing through it. My doctor said to stop if the pain 
gets too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Hoch lives at Bay Hill but said he doesn't play the course often. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson shot a 71 to go with his first-round 67. Pavin shot his second 
consecutive 69 and Andrade, a third-year pro, had a 70. 
</P>
<P>
"Things just went right for me today," said Blake, whose best finish was a tie 
for third in last year's Atlanta Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, starting his 17th year on the tour, was so disgusted with his putting 
that he gave his putter to a small boy behind the 18th green and went shopping 
for another one. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Byrum, the first-round leader with a 64, fell apart on Friday, bogeying 
nine holes on the way to an 81. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got nothing to say," Byrum said after finishing the disastrous round that 
tied the high score of the opening round by Mike Nicolette. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Jones sank a 17-foot birdie putt at the 18th hole to cap a 
three-under-par 70 and take a one-shot lead over Donna White and Kristi Albers 
after the second round of the LPGA Turquoise Classic at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who was tied for second place after an opening-round 69, started on the 
back nine and went to six-under with birdies on the par-four 12th and par-five 
13th holes. 
</P>
<P>
After bogeying Nos. 16 and 18, she birdied Nos. 2 and 4 before her decisive 
putt off the fringe at No. 9 for a seven-under 139 total at the halfway mark. 
</P>
<P>
Albers, a non-winner in five years on the tour, shot a bogey-free 70 to take 
the early second-round lead. She started the day in a five-way tie for ninth 
place. 
</P>
<P>
White, who was a stroke off the lead after an opening-round 69, shot a 71 for a 
six-under 140 total on the 6,514-yard Moon Valley Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
First-round co-leader Cindy Figg-Currier and Janet Coles were both at 
four-under 142 through 36 holes. Figg-Currier had a 74 and Coles shot 69. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mowry shot a six-under-par 66 and grabbed a one-stroke lead after the 
first round of the Grandslam Championship at Kurimotomachi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Chi San-hsu of Taiwan was a shot behind at 67. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, the leading money winner on the Seniors Tour, Don January, Dave 
Hill and Japan's Hideo Jibiki shot 69s and were tied for third.

RAMS SIGN SECOND PLAN B FREE AGENT, ILESIC, UNPROTECTED BY CHARGERS 
</P>

<P>
One week after punter Dale Hatcher signed with the Green Bay Packers, the Rams 
announced Friday the signing of punter Hank Ilesic, who had been left 
unprotected by the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Ilesic, 30, joined the Chargers after the second game of the 1989 season and 
finished with an average of 40.1 yards on 76 punts. 
</P>
<P>
He came to San Diego after a 13-year career in the Canadian Football League, 
which he joined out of high school. Ilesic played six seasons for Edmonton and 
seven for Toronto, averaging 45.4 yards a kick in his CFL career. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams lost interest in Hatcher after he finished last in the NFC with a 38.8 
average last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have signed two Plan B free agents, Ilesic and guard/center Joe 
Milinichik, and have lost three -- guard Tony Slaton, safety James Washington 
and Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Mike Lansford worked out for the Chargers Thursday and also is 
considering an offer from the Phoenix Cardinals. Receiver Ron Brown said he 
probably will make a signing decision Monday, and teams still in the running 
include the Denver Broncos and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Plan B free agents have until April 1 to sign with other NFL teams. CHRIS

NEWSWIRE: FORMER BADGER COACH JARDINE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Jardine, former Wisconsin football coach who had a heart transplant last 
year, died Friday morning of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for University of Wisconsin Hospital said Jardine's death was not 
due to rejection of a donated heart he received in transplant surgery on June 
16, 1989 at UW Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jardine, 54, was admitted to the hospital Wednesday when he complained of 
shortness of breath. His condition worsened and he was unconscious and being 
maintained on life support systems in intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Jardine was the Badgers' coach in 1970-77, posting a 37-47-3 record in eight 
seasons. His only winning season was in 1974, when the Badgers went 7-4, 
including a 21-20 upset of Nebraska in a nationally televised game. In 1977, 
the team started 5-0 and won a spot in the top 20 rankings only to lose its 
last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Jardine resigned Nov. 7, 1977, after the fourth consecutive defeat.

CANADIENS SLOW CAPITALS' RUN 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Montreal Canadiens have faltered on the road this season and find 
themselves in third place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
But there are nights when the Canadiens' chief offensive threat, Stephane 
Richer, makes himself at home anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case Friday night at Landover, Md. Richer scored two goals to lead 
the Canadiens to a 4-2 victory over the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals, trying to clinch a playoff spot in the Patrick Division, missed a 
chance to pull into second place in the division. 
</P>
<P>
In the Patrick, only the New York Rangers have clinched a playoff spot. The 
other five teams are all in contention for the other three berths. 
</P>
<P>
Richer, a 50-goal scorer in 1987-88, has 48 goals. 
</P>
<P>
Canadien goalie Patrick Roy, in winning his 30th game, faced 20 shots and only 
four in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals might have to win three of their last five games to be assured of 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Craig Coxe scored the tiebreaking goal with 3:14 
left to lead the Canucks at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
A victory would have put the Jets two points out of second place in the Smythe 
Division. The Edmonton Oilers have 85 points and the Jets have 81. DAN HAFNER

START ME UP: MCHALE FUELS CELTICS, 101-98 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Bird is getting most of the credit for the resurgence of the Boston 
Celtics. He should, but another reason is Kevin McHale. 
</P>
<P>
Most of this season the veteran forward has been coming off the bench trying to 
provide instant points. It wasn't until Coach Jimmy Rodgers put McHale back in 
the starting lineup that the Celtics made their move. 
</P>
<P>
McHale scored 27 points Friday night at Boston and the Celtics, after almost 
wasting a 31-point lead, defeated Atlanta, 101-98. 
</P>
<P>
Since McHale returned to the starting lineup, the Celtics have won six out of 
seven to move into second place in the Atlantic Division, 1 1/2 games behind 
the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics took a 71-40 lead with a little more than four minutes left in the 
third quarter before Kenny Smith, who had all his 19 points in the second half, 
brought the Hawks back. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the last minute the Hawks cut the Celtic lead to three points. But 
with 24 seconds to play, they allowed the Celtics to run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
McHale was concerned about the Celtics letting the Hawks back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't play like we did in the second half and expect to win a lot of 
games," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Celtics' last seven games, McHale has averaged 27 points and taken much 
of the pressure off Bird. 
</P>
<P>
While the Celtics are making a fight for another division title, the Hawks 
(31-36) are in danger of failing to make the playoffs. After their third 
consecutive loss, they are in eighth place in the East -- the last playoff 
spot, but only a half-game game ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 106, New York 93 -- They will probably stagger to a playoff spot, but 
the Knicks' collapse seems nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks couldn't even make a game of it on the road against the team with 
the worst record in the NBA and lost their fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Dell Curry made 10 of his 14 field goal attempts, including three in a row in 
the closing minutes and the Hornets led almost the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets (13-53) led by 16 points in the middle of the third quarter and, 
despite 32 points and 14 rebounds by Patrick Ewing, the Knicks never again were 
closer than eight points. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks led the Atlantic Division almost from the start of the season and 
were still on top last Sunday. The loss to the Hornets dropped them into third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The slump began before Charles Oakley, their leading rebounder, was lost for 
the season and the Knicks show no signs of pulling out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 115, Sacramento 99 -- The 76ers are playing well, but the way the 
Celtics are going, even Charles Barkley isn't claiming the division title. 
</P>
<P>
On a night at Philadelphia in which Barkley and Hersey Hawkins were both six 
for 18 from the field, the 76ers still had a rather easy time winning their 
third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento's Wayman Tisdale had 27 points and 11 rebounds, but the Kings, after 
a good first quarter, fell to 5-28 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins finished with 21 points, seven during a 17-2 run that broke the game 
open early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 102, Cleveland 95 -- Despite his painful thumb, Michael Jordan started 
firing again at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In recent games Jordan had been reluctant to shoot, but he took 32 shots, 
making 18, in 40 minutes to lead the Bulls to their 15th victory in their last 
17 games. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 14 points during the first quarter to get the Bulls going early. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers could have moved into eighth place in the East with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 106, Golden State 91 -- The Warriors need to be at full strength to have a 
chance on the road against a good team. 
</P>
<P>
With their best player, Chris Mullin, still out because of a lung infection, 
they were no match for the Jazz at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone had 27 points and the Jazz, leading all the way, improved their 
record at home to 32-4. 
</P>
<P>
Although he missed all eight of his shots from the field, the Jazz's John 
Stockton had 15 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 120, Minnesota 99 -- The Johnsons, Eddie and Kevin, teamed up to hand 
the Timberwolves their 22nd consecutive loss on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson, who has been in a shooting slump, was 14 for 22 from the field 
and had 37 points. Kevin Johnson had the sixth triple-double of his career -- 
13 points, 10 rebounds and 18 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 106, Miami 103 -- Derek Harper clicked from long range at Miami and the 
Mavericks held on for their third victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Harper sank a club-record seven three-pointers in 11 attempts and finished with 
34 points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 125, New Jersey 109 -- Rik Smits had 30 points and 14 rebounds in the 
game at Indianapolis as Pacers (34-34) handed the Nets their 22nd consecutive 
road loss and ninth consecutive defeat overall. DAN HAFNER

'STAR WARS' SCORES GO DIGITAL AT LUCAS' SKYWALKER RANCH; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: JOHN WILLIAMS LEADS A HAND-PICKED ENSEMBLE OF 95 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
MUSICIANS THROUGH A NEW RECORDING OF SELECTIONS FROM THE BLOCKBUSTER FILM 
TRILOGY. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The force was definitely with John Williams and George Lucas this week. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years after film maker Lucas first pitted Luke Skywalker, Princess 
Leia and Han Solo against Darth Vader, he invited his favorite movie composer 
to his sumptuous 3,000-acre Skywalker Ranch in the rolling hills of Marin 
County for a two-day "Star Wars" taping session. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, about to enter his 11th year as conductor of the Boston Pops, briskly 
and congenially led a hand-picked ensemble of 95 Northern California musicians 
through the recording of 13 selections from the blockbuster film trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting compact disc, the first digital recording of "Star Wars" tracks, 
is scheduled to be released by Sony Classical Productions this fall. 
</P>
<P>
For Williams, 58, less press-shy than the reclusive Lucas, the project is 
particularly poignant. The original "Star Wars" sound track, recorded in 1977 
at the defunct Denham Studios' Anvil scoring stage near London, won the 
composer one of his four Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
According to Williams, it was when Lucas learned that the British studio would 
be torn down that he got the idea to build his own world-class facility, over 
the objections of underlings who deemed it too ambitious and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Untold millions of dollars later, Williams and the Skywalker Symphony, as the 
collection of free-lance musicians is called, reaped the benefits Monday and 
Tuesday as the sounds of "Princess Leia's Theme" and other melodies 
reverberated through the 30-foot-high room. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a treat to see George's dream be realized," Williams said during a lunch 
break, pointing out the state-of-the-art "mixing" console and the studio's 
undulating mauve walls and ceiling, where panels can be shifted to change the 
acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the gaggle of performers, engineers and production people imported for 
the session agreed that Lucas, a legendary big thinker, and the studio's 
designer, Tomlinson Holman (also the developer of the THX "The Audience Is 
Listening" movie-theater sound system), had outdone themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no doubt one of the finest studios in the world," said Mark Genfan, an 
engineer with Sony Classical Productions in New York. Even so, Sony brought in 
its own sophisticated recording equipment, including a machine that records 48 
separate tracks on a half-inch tape. 
</P>
<P>
At midday, producer Thomas Z. Shepard said with a disappointed sigh that the 
project would wrap up by late afternoon, absolutely on schedule and too 
speedily to suit him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stay here a month," said Shepard, who flew in from New York and 
was one of the lucky ones staying on the premises. "I've never yearned for 
inefficiency so much." 
</P>
<P>
Skywalker Ranch, headquarters of Lucasfilm Ltd., covers nearly 3,000 of Lucas' 
4,700 bucolic acres, of which 95% has been permanently dedicated to open space.

The main offices are in what appears to be a large white Victorian mansion, 
with big front porch, gingerbread trim, leaded glass doors and redwood 
paneling. Although the place looks fit for a king, no one lives full-time on 
the ranch. But during the day, the ranch is home to about 150 employees who 
work in post-production, licensing and other of Lucas' busy divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old recording studio -- which has been used by such diverse 
performers as Bobby McFerrin, Huey Lewis &amp; the News, the Grateful Dead and 
the American Baroque Ensemble -- is housed down the road in the brick and wood 
Tech Building. It was built to look like a winery, complete with fledgling 
vineyard, and faces an artificial lake where ducks and egrets splash. Lucas 
installed the lake for fire protection; the ranch has its own firefighting 
squad and two shiny red firetrucks. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas has scattered throughout the buildings an impressive collection of French 
movie posters, paintings by such artists as Norman Rockwell and Maxfield 
Parrish and memorabilia from his movies, including a model of Yoda, the wise 
Jedi master who taught Luke Skywalker how to use "the force" to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The "Star Wars" taping was a reunion for the Skywalker Symphony, which was 
first assembled from various Bay Area groups for Linda Ronstadt's Grammy 
Award-winning album "Cry Like a Rainstorm -- Howl Like the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who lives with his wife, Samantha, in Westwood when he is not touring 
with the Boston Pops, said he was impressed with the orchestra's skill. "We're 
rehearsing on the spot," said the composer, dressed casually in black pullover, 
gray slacks and running shoes. "It's going very well." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Star Wars," "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi," 
Williams and Lucas have worked together on the "Indiana Jones" trilogy directed 
by Steven Spielberg, another longtime Williams associate ("Jaws," "Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T."). 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was executive producer of last year's "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade," for which Williams' music has been nominated for an Oscar. (The 
prolific Williams, who spends about three months on each score, is also up for 
an Academy Award Monday for "Born on the Fourth of July.")

GAO OPENS INVESTIGATION INTO FUNDING OF 'OBSCENE' ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. General Accounting Office said Friday it had opened an investigation 
of alleged improper funding of obscene artworks by the National Endowment for 
the Arts, responding to a demand for a probe earlier this week by Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
A GAO official, however, said a preliminary reading of the NEA's 1990 
appropriation bill, which precludes funding of obscene works unless they meet 
high standards for artistic excellence, appears to give the arts endowment 
extremely wide leeway. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was brought into the NEA 
controversy by Helms when the North Carolina senator asked, in a letter dated 
March 6 but not made public until this week, for an inquiry into "possible 
violations of law by the NEA." 
</P>
<P>
John E. Frohnmayer, the arts endowment's chairman, said GAO investigators were 
meeting Friday afternoon in Washington with endowment officials. "I believe we 
have been very diligent," he said. "I do welcome the review. If there are 
things that need to be remedied, I'm the first one that wants to remedy them. 
But, if not, I hope this impartial review lays the issue to rest." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Wray, the GAO's associate general counsel, confirmed the agency is 
responding to a demand by Helms that it investigate possible violations of 
restrictive language in the arts endowment's 1990 funding bill. The rider was 
inserted as a compromise to resolve an intense controversy last year in which 
Helms attempted -- unsuccessfully -- to ban federal funding for any art that 
was obscene, indecent or even just offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Wray said clear questions exist over whether the restrictive language, which 
permits funding of any arts project that meets high standards of artistic 
excellence, has any practical effect on banning federal funding of anything. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the restriction is written leaves the endowment some discretion in 
what to fund and what not to fund," Wray said. "It certainly gives them the 
right to make a judgment. If they make the determination (that a possibly 
obscene work had exceptional artistic merit), there would be no illegal use of 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
A Helms spokesman said the senator would have no statement on the NEA 
controversy until at least Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Helms letter included a list of nine specific arts projects that Helms 
contended were illegal under the terms of the 1990 appropriation law. But while 
many of the examples were works or shows that had previously been brought into 
the arts endowment controversy, all nine examples appeared to have been 
projects funded by the NEA before the current appropriation bill went into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
The major elements in Helms's complaint included "Witnesses: Against Our 
Vanishing," an AIDS-related show at a New York City gallery that precipitated a 
major NEA crisis last November when Frohnmayer first rescinded -- then restored 
-- NEA support, and "Modern Primitives," another 1989 show. 
</P>
<P>
"Modern Primitives" featured body piecing and piercing of the genital organs. 
It was organized by an arts group in Seattle and exhibited at Southern 
Exposure, a gallery affiliated with San Francisco's Project Artaud. 
</P>
<P>
The Helms list also included a 1989 performance by Annie Sprinkle, a 
controversial New York performance artist, to which conservatives objected. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not question that the endowment's chairman (Frohnmayer) may be sincere in 
his assertion that none of the NEA funds are being used to support such 'art,' 
" Helms said, "but the evidence to the contrary is so compelling that it is 
imperative that there be an objective investigation."

RAMADAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The holiest month on the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims with daytime 
fasting and devotion, will begin next week after the first appearance of the 
new moon's crescent. The Islamic Center of Southern California has calculated 
that Tuesday will be the first day of the fast, but other centers have 
indicated that the observance should begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: Ramadan is the month on the lunar calendar when the Prophet Mohammed 
(570-632) was said to have received the first revelations of the Koran, the 
holy scriptures of Islam. Fasting is one of the pillars, or obligations, of the 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVANCES: Faithful Muslims are expected to neither eat nor drink between 
daybreak and dark during the 28-day month with exceptions made for the very 
young and old, the sick, pregnant women and those with physical problems. If 
necessary, the fasting time may be made up at another time or by contributions 
to feed the poor. The period brings together families and friends for evening 
dinners and Koran reading and prayer. Humility and compassion toward others is 
emphasized. The month ends with the sighting or calculated appearance of the 
next new moon.

DESCANSO GARDENS SPRINGING INTO BLOOM WITH ANNUAL FLOWER FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today marks the beginning of a monthlong celebration devoted entirely to 
beauty: The Festival of Spring Flowers at Descanso Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The festival begins with the Pasadena Garden Club's two-day flower show and 
continues through April 22 when the San Fernando Valley Rose Society holds its 
annual rose show and sale. 
</P>
<P>
According to George Lewis, Descanso Gardens superintendent-horticulturist, the 
festival is one of the world's greatest flower shows. Visitors will see a 
panorama of annuals, perennials and flowering trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
Visualize hundreds of thousands of flowers in a tranquil, spacious setting. 
There are miles of paths throughout the 165-acre grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis says the festival is designed to be "free and flowing." Most flower shows 
last only a few days; while the flowers may be at their peaks at the beginning 
of the show, they deteriorate toward the end. By using growing flowers, 
Descanso Gardens assures visitors of spectacular blooms the entire month. 
</P>
<P>
For an introduction and overall view of the gardens, Lewis suggests that 
visitors take the 45-minute guided tram tour. 
</P>
<P>
One of Descanso's most prominent attractions is the Camellia Forest. Here is 
one of the largest plantings of camellias in the world -- thousands of shrubs 
featuring more than 600 varieties. Some of the shrubs are almost 50 years old 
and more than 20 feet tall. Showing large blooms in white, pink, rose, scarlet 
and variegated pink and white and red and white, the shrubs are nestled among 
California live oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
A special feature of the 25-acre Camellia Forest is the display of a type of 
camellia called "reticulatea," which has huge, wavy blooms measuring up to nine 
inches in diameter. The reticulate varieties were discovered in China during 
World War II. Ten varieties were brought to Descanso from the Kunming Temple of 
China in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Bulbs -- more than 30,000 tulips, 10,000 daffodils, 2,000 glads and thousands 
of others -- have been specially placed for the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Descanso offers the largest flowering collection of tulips on the West Coast 
with more than 15 varieties planted in the Tulip Walk and along other bedding 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Other special features of the Festival of Spring Flowers include a landscape 
designer-created Display Garden, an Old English Garden, an Award-Winning Iris 
Garden and beds of annuals and other plants. 
</P>
<P>
In the Display Garden, designers have created displays to suit different 
landscaping needs. 
</P>
<P>
The Old English Garden is across from the Tram Station and features plants 
found in an old English countryside garden -- hollyhock, day lilies, 
snapdragons, foxglove, buddeleja, penstemon and others. 
</P>
<P>
The Iris Garden displays gold cup and silver medal winners. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the gardens, Lewis has extensively incorporated a concept he calls 
"two-story bloom," planting bulbs among beds of low-growing annuals. 
</P>
<P>
The regular attractions at Descanso Gardens also warrant a visit during the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
* Two rose gardens -- Modern Roses and Roses of Yesterday -- are found on the 
grounds. Only the Modern Roses garden will have bloom during the festival. It 
features an array of hybrid tea roses. 
</P>
<P>
* Bird fanciers will appreciate the Bird Observation Station. The ponds are a 
regular stopping point for wild waterfowl and other birds. 
</P>
<P>
* Azalea varieties in the gardens will begin their bloom, as will many native 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
* Descanso Gardens has the largest collection of native live oak trees in 
Southern California, as well as redwoods, pines, cedars, firs and flowering 
fruit trees that should be at their peak during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Descanso Gardens is at 1418 Descanso Drive, La Canada Flintridge. Open daily 
except Christmas Day. Hours: 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission: adults $3; seniors 
and students $1.50; children 5-12 75 cents, and children under 5 free. Tram 
tour of the gardens: $1.50. For information, call (818) 790-5414.

NOT YOUR GARDEN VARIETY CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The competition is tense. The rules are exacting. One little slip and you're 
out. 
</P>
<P>
This is a gardening contest? 
</P>
<P>
Yes -- and not just any old garden-variety one. It's a Gardening Club of 
America garden show, sanctioned by one of the oldest gardening groups in the 
country and stricter than you ever may have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
All the attention to detail makes it tough for exhibitors but wonderful for 
visitors, who can see dozens of perfect, unusual specimens during an 
afternoon's visit to a GCA show. 
</P>
<P>
And this weekend you can visit one of these Cadillacs of flower shows: The 
Pasadena Garden Club -- one of three GCA clubs in Southern California -- is 
holding its annual competition. Open today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., 
the show will be in Van De Kamp Hall at Descanso Gardens. The show kicks off 
the annual Festival of Spring Flowers at the gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours is considered a small flower show," says Peggy Stewart, publicity 
chairwoman for the event. But that doesn't exempt it from the regulations found 
in a half-inch-thick handbook mandated by GCA. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, contestants must fill out entry cards with complete botanical 
names of each plant in an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to say daisy isn't enough," Stewart says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the club has to provide GCA-approved judges, and 51% of the 
entries must be from GCA members. 
</P>
<P>
"The show must be open to the public and the schedule should be 'creative and 
interesting to exhibitors and the public,' " Stewart says. 
</P>
<P>
The show is divided into two broad sections -- horticulture and floral 
arrangements. These sections are then divided further; for instance, 
horticulture includes cut specimens, potted plants, parent plants and 
propagation, and "card table" -- a catchall category for plants that don't fit 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Floral arrangement is the section that is typically most enchanting to show 
visitors -- if for no other reason than the whimsical, old-fashioned names 
given to the different divisions. 
</P>
<P>
What would you imagine "Tea for Two" might mean? To the Pasadena Garden Club, 
it's "two complementary arrangements of fresh flowers in teatime containers. 
Accessories permitted. To be displayed on a neutral covered table 36 inches 
high in a neutral-colored niche 27 inches high by 24 inches wide by 18 inches 
deep." Whew! 
</P>
<P>
Other divisions include "My Favorite Things," "Farmer in the Dell," "Easter 
Parade" (in which contestants decorate a hat of their choice) and "Blue Skies" 
(an entire picnic scene set up in a room-size cubbyhole). And each division has 
rules as specific as those for "Tea for Two." 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that contestants stick to the rules, exhibits are checked by a 
"passing committee" for compliance. 
</P>
<P>
"The people on this committee bring show schedules, a red pencil and measuring 
tape," Stewart says. "They have to be sure the arrangement is in good 
condition, not drooping, no insects, and that the flowers are in excellent 
shape with no holes in them." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a delicate job," says Cynthia Lewis, who, along with Susan Seidel, is 
chairing the show. "The passers have to have experience and tact and a helpful 
spirit because they can help an exhibitor come into compliance if something is 
a little wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Lewis says, the miniatures can't be more than 5 inches in any 
direction. The passing clerk may see something just a bit over the specified 
size and she can help the exhibitor either pull it out or snip it off so that 
it's not visible to the judges. 
</P>
<P>
The passing committee member may also keep things from entering that wouldn't 
have a chance in the judging. 
</P>
<P>
"The job is to keep the exhibitor from being embarrassed publicly," Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
Entries were "passed" Friday morning and judged Friday afternoon; by the time 
the public arrives today, ribbons will be displayed and the winners announced. 
</P>
<P>
Many guests marvel at how fresh the arrangements stay throughout the weekend: 
Flowers you cut yourself at home always seem to sag considerably faster. Peg 
Stewart offers some tips to make cut flowers last as long as possible: 
</P>
<P>
* As soon as you cut a flower, plunge the stem into a bucket of water. Bring 
the blossom inside and put it into the container of "conditioning solution" you 
prepared before your foray into the garden (a teaspoon each of bleach, sugar 
and vinegar and enough water to fill a small bucket). Cut the stem again under 
water to keep it from sealing as it would normally. 
</P>
<P>
* For your vase, use a mixture of one-third Sprite and two-thirds water. Rush 
the flowers from one solution to another, and replenish the vase frequently. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement you put in the middle of your dining room table may not be as 
ornate as, say, "Get Me to the Church on Time," but it will last a lot longer 
than you're probably used to. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Garden Club show is free.

<TEXT>
<P>
Police and prosecutors loyal to Moscow spread throughout Lithuania on Friday 
and the leader of the breakaway Baltic republic accused Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev of waging "psychological war" as the Kremlin bore down 
hard to halt Lithuania's bid for independence. 
</P>
<P>
As tensions mounted, the Soviet government ordered U.S. and other foreign 
diplomats here to leave, giving two American diplomats now in the city 12 hours 
to depart. The diplomats, based at the U.S. Consulate General in Leningrad, 
said they would leave as soon as travel arrangements could be made. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve days after Lithuania's legislature voted overwhelmingly for 
independence, the Kremlin's grip tightened immensely, with the Soviet Interior 
Ministry, which handles law enforcement, beefing up local units and the KGB 
recalling reservists for its border guard and dispatching additional troops and 
equipment to the frontier. 
</P>

Before dawn today, a column of almost 100 military vehicles rolled through the 
center of the Lithuanian capital, the Associated Press reported. The convoy 
moved along the main highway through the heart of Vilnius in the early morning 
darkness without stopping, the news service said. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency Tass spoke direly of the Lithuanian government 
provoking "anarchy in all its forms" by its recent actions, and a KGB general 
warned of possible North Atlantic Treaty Organization action to exploit the 
disorder. Such official talk has frequently been employed by the Kremlin 
leadership to prepare the nation for major actions or shifts in policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are under constant pressure from outside . . . (and) in Lithuania itself, 
in the form of a foreign army," Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis 
declared. "The size of that army keeps growing. It is openly demonstrating that 
it is armed and very strong and ready for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet military helicopters hovered over this city of 579,000 people, dropping 
Russian-language leaflets giving the text of a Wednesday directive from 
Gorbachev condemning the secession as illegal and decreeing measures to 
reassert Moscow's control. 
</P>
<P>
Visa-free travel between Lithuania and neighboring Poland was suspended, and 
the Soviet government ordered steps taken to bar entry to journalists and 
people "inclined to unlawful actions," effectively increasing the isolation of 
this Ireland-sized republic as it faces the might of the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry, in a dispatch carried by Tass, indicated that units 
loyal to Moscow are now deployed throughout Lithuania, from the Polish frontier 
to the border with the republics of Byelorussia and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
"Steps have been taken to strengthen the protection of important federal 
installations," the ministry said. "Patrols, stationary posts and mobile 
transport inspection groups are operating on all motor-ways, including in 
border areas." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow-based ministry said its officials are overseeing confiscation of 
firearms in line with Gorbachev's directive, the first real use of his expanded 
powers as Soviet president, a new government post he was elected to last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said it sent in "groups" of officials but did not reveal 
their number or functions. As well as overseeing the nation's fight against 
crime, prisons and other police matters, the ministry has its own armed force 
of about 340,000 men. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Valentin K. Gaponenko of the KGB border guard told Tass that local 
reserves have been mobilized to reinforce detachments patrolling the Lithuanian 
stretch of the Soviet-Polish border. The Interfax News Agency said a special 
squad of senior Soviet prosecutors arrived in Vilnius on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep of these concerted actions showed Gorbachev's Kremlin moving 
resolutely to take command of key sectors while allowing Landsbergis and his 
allies, at least for a time, to remain in power, even if their orders will now 
go unheeded by many officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian president, in his remarks to the republic's Supreme Council, or 
Parliament, said the Soviet military was reinforcing local garrisons, as it 
moved from economic measures against secession to a show of force. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing maneuvers and new units being transferred here, and how they are 
demonstrating their arms and their presence," Landsbergis said. "We see this as 
part of a psychological war -- a certain kind of psychological warfare is being 
waged against Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene had complained Thursday of increased 
activity by the 30,000 Soviet soldiers that she estimated are stationed in the 
republic, and demanded an explanation from Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Landsbergis' charge that new detachments were being sent, 
an official in the Soviet Defense Ministry's external relations department in 
Moscow said, "We have no such information." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities barred journalists from going to Lithuania on Friday because 
"the situation is changing there," a Foreign Ministry official told 
representatives of the British news agency Reuters in Moscow on Friday night. 
Dozens of foreign correspondents were drawn to Vilnius to cover the republic's 
dramatic March 11 independence proclamation and the escalating crisis with 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters already in Vilnius were apparently unaffected by the new ruling, 
which springs from Gorbachev's directives on Wednesday ordering tighter 
controls on who is allowed to enter Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president also gave Lithuanians seven days to surrender their 
firearms, or have them confiscated. On Thursday, he instructed Landsbergis to 
stop Lithuanians from signing up for volunteer groups designed to replace the 
KGB border guard and Soviet police, and gave him until today to report on what 
has been done. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said Friday night that 5,500 firearms had been seized or handed in over 
the last two days. However, the Soviet television news program Vremya estimated 
that there is a total of about 30,000 firearms registered in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered acts of defiance were reported Friday. In Kaunas, a reserve 
lieutenant colonel who heads the local branch of a paramilitary organization 
that prepares young men for the army refused to hand over his arsenal. Military 
units intervened to seize 873 firearms and over a half-million cartridges, Tass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Yonova, 30 paratroopers commanded by a general surrounded a shooting range 
and demanded that all weapons be surrendered. The Lithuanians refused, and 
negotiations were still going on Friday night, said Edvard Tuskenis of the 
government Information Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow authorities acted in force to oppose decisions taken by the secession 
government, with Tass reporting that Lithuania's negation of Soviet laws 
"cannot but provoke anarchy in all its forms." 
</P>
<P>
Acting Soviet Prosecutor General Alexei Vasiliev rejected as illegal the 
appointment Thursday of a new top prosecutor, noting that the constitution 
empowers only the prosecutor general in Moscow to make such an appointment. 
Gostelradio, the Soviet broadcasting authority, said Lithuania had no right to 
dissolve its local branch. 
</P>
<P>
But the most worrisome comment for average Soviet citizens were those of 
Gaponenko, the KGB border guard chief, who said he couldn't rule out the 
possibility that "the adversary might use the unstable situation and attempt 
some sort of action on the state border of the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
"In recent days, warships of member countries of NATO have been observed" off 
the Lithuanian shore, he told Tass. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian government Information Bureau said in a statement Friday that it 
had become increasingly evident that the Soviet Union is preparing to use force 
to crush the secession attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We turn with hope to the nations of the world, governments of nation-states 
and all people of goodwill, to request that protests be made against the 
possible use of any form of coercion and violence against a peaceful member 
state of the world community, Lithuania, and its citizens," said the statement, 
which repeated a plea made by Landsbergis. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, helicopters dropping leaflets flew close to the vast, 
brightly lit hall where the Supreme Council now meets. Several deputies 
chuckled grimly at the din, symbol of Moscow's continuing power over the 
would-be independent state. 
</P>
<P>
As control over much of Lithuanian life seemingly slipped through their 
fingers, the lawmakers gathered in their gold-toned chamber to choose 18 
ministers to take the reins of government. One would be a defense minister, but 
without an army. 
</P>
<P>
The legislature was to meet through the night to quiz candidates for the 
ministerial jobs and make appointments. Landsbergis said the haste was 
necessary so that Lithuania could present a united front and "speak to the 
world also in the name of an already confirmed Council of Ministers." 
</P>
<P>
The republican president met Friday night with three Soviet generals to fix the 
status of at least 840 young Lithuanian men who have recently deserted from the 
Soviet Army.

PRESSURE ON TILL 'SENSE PREVAILS,' LIGACHEV SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The Soviet leadership is prepared to increase political and economic pressure 
on Lithuania until "common sense prevails" and it abandons its attempt to break 
away from the Soviet Union, a senior member of the Communist Party's ruling 
Politburo warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev, describing the Baltic republic's declaration of independence 
as a grave crisis for the Soviet Union, said in an interview with The Times 
that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the country's leadership are ready to 
implement "a whole range of measures" to force Lithuania to drop its secession 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev unequivocally ruled out once again the use of military force against 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to take any military measures to resolve this issue, 
absolutely not," he said. "We still believe, at least up to this moment, that 
in the end common sense will prevail there. We have to show patience here, but 
at the same time determination." 
</P>
<P>
Although regarded as the voice of conservatism on the Politburo for his 
forthright adherence to traditional socialist values, Ligachev was clearly 
speaking for the whole Soviet leadership as he declared with "full frankness 
and full authority" that Moscow is determined that the Lithuanian secession not 
succeed, at least not in such a unilateral way and not at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Our president is in a very resolute mood," Ligachev said of Gorbachev. "He 
will take political measures against this, he will take economic measures, and 
he is absolutely dedicated to the enforcement of Soviet laws in this 
constituent republic, in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, Gorbachev has issued a series of orders with the aim of 
asserting the central government's authority in Lithuania and preventing the 
nationalists there from implementing their plans for independence. 
</P>
<P>
Following a plan of graduated measures, he put Lithuanian factories and other 
enterprises owned or managed by the central government under the direct 
authority of Moscow; dispatched internal troops to tighten security at key 
installations, such as the Ignalina Atomic Energy Station; ordered the Interior 
Ministry and the KGB, the country's security and intelligence agency, to 
strengthen their control of borders and on foreigners in Lithuania; ordered 
Lithuania to stop formation of its own border force and customs service; 
ordered Lithuanian citizens to surrender all weapons, and sent a high-level 
team of prosecutors to Lithuania to enforce the federal constitution and 
national laws there. 
</P>
<P>
How much further Gorbachev will go, Ligachev suggested, stressing the Kremlin's 
firmness on the issue, depends on how long the crisis lasts; Moscow is prepared 
to increase the pressure until the Lithuanians back down. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the danger, and we shall continue to take measures, quite 
adequate measures," Ligachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev emphasized that the Soviet leadership does want a political settlement 
of the crisis, but he said that talks would have to be on Moscow's terms. 
</P>
<P>
"They want us to negotiate with them, but we have already declared with full 
responsibility, and we continue to maintain, that we will never engage in 
negotiations with the current leadership of Lithuania," he said. "But we are 
prepared to resolve any problems, whether economic or social, that are 
discussed with other constituent republics in ordinary and established ways." 
</P>
<P>
The difference between "negotiations" and "discussions" is crucial for both 
sides. Moscow and Lithuania interpret "negotiations" to mean talks between two 
sovereign states, thus implying Soviet recognition of Lithuania's independence. 
They interpret "discussions" to mean simply talks between two parties without 
regard to status. 
</P>
<P>
While this difference is now a barrier, it could become the basis of a 
compromise in which Moscow calls the talks "discussions" and pretends not to 
hear when Lithuania calls them "negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Parliament has named a delegation to represent it in 
"negotiations" with Moscow, but the talks have been stalled -- except for a 
brief, half-hour, midweek meeting between Gorbachev and two Lithuanian members 
of Parliament -- by the lack of agreement on their goals and status. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow's view, Lithuania's decision to re-establish the independence it had 
before it was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 was "an 
anti-constitutional takeover," Ligachev said, and the move violated both the 
Soviet constitution and national legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"No organ of whatever republic has the right to bypass the Supreme Soviet 
(legislature) of the Soviet Union and without obtaining the prior agreement of 
other constituent republics to, for example, suspend the Soviet constitution on 
its territory, as Lithuania did," Ligachev contended. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that issues connected with secession of a constituent republic must, 
first of all, be the prerogative of the entire population of that republic. I 
believe that in deciding such matters, a referendum should be held." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Communist Party is appealing to those Lithuanian Communists 
who remained loyal to it when the Lithuanian branch of the party declared 
itself independent from Moscow in December. Citizens' committees are being 
established to demand "strict observance of the Soviet constitution and keeping 
Lithuania within the Soviet Union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that the decision to declare an independent Lithuanian state received 
a very mixed reaction in Lithuania," he said. "So far, the majority of workers 
do support that declaration, but we are confident that, as events develop, the 
trend among the people will intensify in favor of keeping Lithuania in the 
Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev accused the Lithuanian leaders of failing to assess the consequences 
of their action, of refusing to take account of its impact on the country as a 
whole and, consequently, of jeopardizing the political, economic and social 
reforms now under way here. 
</P>
<P>
"We could, in fact, create very serious difficulties for the new leadership, 
but we are thinking about the people, about the ordinary citizens of the Soviet 
Union who live in Lithuania. So, we cannot deliberately inflict damage and 
create economic hardships." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev said that Lithuania's bid for independence is a serious threat not 
only to the Soviet Union's integrity as a state but to the ultimate success of 
the reform program known as perestroika. The realistic but long-term solution 
of all the Soviet Union's nationality problems, including the Lithuanian 
crisis, he said, lies in the success of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have developed, widely and in depth, democracy and self-management by 
the people, the degree of acuteness of ethnic problems will decline," he said.

STATE STUDY SAYS COURTS ARE RIFE WITH SEX BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE SYSTEM: JUDICIAL COUNCIL COMMITTEE URGES DOZENS OF REFORMS TO IMPROVE 
WOMEN'S STATUS. 
</P>

<P>
A special committee of the state Judicial Council, ending a landmark three-year 
inquiry, reported Friday that it had found widespread sex discrimination in the 
California courts and proposed dozens of reforms aimed at improving the status 
of women in the system. 
</P>
<P>
The group urged, among other things, the adoption of new ethical codes 
requiring judges to act against bias in the courtroom and barring them from 
belonging to discriminatory clubs, expansion of legal protections for victims 
of domestic violence, and changes in the law to enlarge child-support awards. 
While not formally recommending such action, it said that appointment of more 
women to the judiciary would substantially curb sex discrimination in the 
judicial process. 
</P>
<P>
The committee cited instances of "openly hostile" behavior and demeaning 
remarks by judges against female lawyers, litigants, witnesses and other 
participants in court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, while emphasizing that such incidents may occur only rarely, said it 
had received complaints that unnamed judges had engaged in unwanted sexual 
advances, erected pin-up pictures in chambers, told dirty jokes and read 
sexually explicit magazines on the bench. One judge, it said, reportedly 
described women lawyers as "menopausal dabblers" who entered the profession 
only after completing the duties of motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry, one of the first in the nation, was launched under former Chief 
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and continued by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, 
the current chairman of the 22-member Judicial Council, the policy-making arm 
of the state judiciary. At present, 29 states have undertaken similar 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The investigating panel, known as the Advisory Committee on Gender Bias in the 
Courts, was chaired by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman and 
state Sen. Diane E. Watson of Los Angeles. The 34-member committee -- made up 
of judges, lawyers, legislators and court administrators -- held public 
hearings throughout the state, conducted surveys of judges and attorneys and 
visited jails where women are in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman stressed that sex bias did not originate in the courts, but rather was 
a reflection of "society as a whole." But he noted that committee members "did 
not realize the extent" of the problem throughout the state. Watson declared: 
"The system is wrought with gender bias and didn't even realize it." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, presiding over a council meeting here Friday, welcomed the 680-page 
report and its 65 recommendations as a "comprehensive review" of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that "there will be some who will emphasize the negatives in 
the report," Lucas said he saw the wide-ranging investigation as evidence of 
the "vitality and accountability" of the state judiciary. "Has any other 
profession been so willing to take on this important inquiry?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The exhaustively detailed report examined complaints of bias throughout the 
system and offered a multitude of proposals to curb discrimination. It 
concluded that sex bias "influences the decision-making and courtroom 
environment" of the California justice system. The judiciary, it said, "must 
respond with clear, decisive and immediate action" to ensure fairness in 
decisions and practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Across the board, we see one common thread -- and that is the lack of 
credibility that women receive, whether they are lawyers or other participants 
in the process," Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin, vice-chair 
of the committee, told reporters. "When women are considered less credible, 
that's inevitably going to affect the substance of a case." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations, if adopted, would require action by an array of 
governmental and legal entities, including the Legislature, the State Bar, the 
California Judges Assn., the state's law schools and the Judicial Council 
itself. The report will undergo further study by a council subcommittee led by 
state appellate Justice Ronald M. George of Los Angeles, with final action on 
its findings and recommendations expected this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the report: 
</P>
<P>
* Concluded that there would be "substantial amelioration" of sex bias in the 
courts if more women were appointed to the bench. At present, 196 of the 1,481 
judicial positions in California -- or 13% -- are occupied by women. In a 
survey of the current judiciary, 64% of the women judges agreed that sex bias 
was "widespread;" by contrast, 23% of the male judges saw such discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
* Asked that judicial ethical canons be revised to provide specifically that 
judges should not belong to clubs that practice "invidious discrimination" and 
to impose the obligation on judges to refrain -- and prevent others -- from 
exhibiting prejudice in court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
* Urged that time limits be expanded on emergency protective orders issued to 
prevent the recurrence of domestic violence -- the victims of which are 95% 
female. New rules should provide that temporary restraining orders are 
available at all court hours and that law enforcement officers can issue such 
orders at all other times. 
</P>
<P>
* Found that child support awards are too low and inadequately enforced. New 
legislation should be enacted to assure that children, after their parents are 
divorced, share in the increased earnings of the wealthier parent. The duration 
of child support should be extended to age 21. 
</P>
<P>
The report also concluded that "stereotypes and prejudices" too often influence 
the outcome in child-custody disputes. There is a tendency to "doubt the 
credibility" of female parents and characterize them as "hysterical or 
vindictive" when they make a claim of child abuse by their spouse. 
</P>
<P>
* Reported that instances "abound" of biased conduct by attorneys. Female 
lawyers report "they have been sexually propositioned by male attorneys, (been) 
the object of their offensive jokes or sexual innuendoes, and the subject of 
their discussions of sexual attributes." One woman lawyer claimed that an 
unnamed prosecutor called her and said that if she agreed to go out with him, 
he would dismiss charges against her client. Another female lawyer said she had 
been called an obscene name by her opposing attorney, but that when she 
complained, the judge said the comment was only "advocacy." 
</P>
<P>
* Recommended that court authorities give higher priority to establishing 
waiting rooms for children of court participants. The lack of child care 
"limits a woman's access to court," the committee said, and represents a form 
of "institutionalized gender bias."

CONTRAS TO START GIVING UP ARMS AND DISBANDING 
</P>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heeding a face-to-face appeal by Nicaragua's Roman Catholic prelate, Contra 
leaders agreed Friday to end their war against the Sandinista government and 
start disbanding their 12,000-member U.S.-backed guerrilla army. 
</P>
<P>
The vaguely worded agreement, signed in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, obliges all 
rebels based in that country to hand their weapons to an international 
peacekeeping force by April 20, five days before Sandinista President Daniel 
Ortega turns over power here to a newly elected pro-American government. 
</P>
<P>
But it set no deadline for armed rebels inside Nicaragua, who make up at least 
one-fourth of the Contra force. Under the accord, they would concentrate in 
cease-fire zones under international supervision, turn in their weapons and 
return to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
A top Contra commander, Oscar Sovalbarro, signed the accord with Cardinal 
Miguel Obando y Bravo and two representatives of Nicaraguan President-elect 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro after six hours of talks at a Honduran air base. 
</P>
<P>
Their communique, read aloud by Obando y Bravo, said Chamorro's victory in the 
Feb. 25 elections "allowed a triumph of the people's will to establish a 
democracy" after eight years of rebel efforts to oust the Sandinistas by force. 
</P>
<P>
"This permits us to declare emphatically that we have decided to begin the 
process of general demobilization of our forces, starting with the disarming of 
those who remain in Honduras," the agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega embraced the cardinal upon his return to Managua and said he would 
instruct the Sandinista army to respect the agreement. He joined with the 
Contras, the political opposition and the Honduran government in describing it 
as historic. 
</P>
<P>
"If the letter of this accord is applied, there will not be a single armed 
Contra in Nicaragua by April 25," he said, insisting on an interpretation not 
explicit in the communique. "In conditions of peace, we can then confront the 
grave economic and social problems that affect all Nicaraguans." 
</P>
<P>
But the Sandinista leader expressed concern over the absence of the top rebel 
commander, Israel Galeano, from the talks. He also said that hundreds of rebels 
had infiltrated from Honduras into Nicaragua in recent weeks, apparently intent 
on eluding any agreement to close their camps in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure there are some who want to stir up the troops to continue the war," 
Ortega said. "But this agreement has to be respected because it interprets a 
national consensus that the war must end." 
</P>
<P>
Since his electoral defeat, Ortega has pressed insistently for rebel 
disarmament as a condition for a peaceful hand-over of his power by his 
revolutionary government. After his victorious rival joined last month in 
urging the Contras to come home in peace, Ortega restored a cease-fire, and 
leaders of Chamorro's National Opposition Union began talks with Contra 
commanders. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which financed and trained the Contras, and the Honduran 
government, their increasingly reluctant host, stepped up the pressure for 
disarmament. Vice President Dan Quayle met with rebel leaders last week and 
Honduran President Rafael L. Callejas arranged Friday's talks, sending an air 
force jet to carry the negotiators from Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
It was the presence of the cardinal, the Nicaraguan most trusted by many Contra 
fighters, that apparently swayed rebel leaders. Entering the talks, he declared 
that "the time has come for the guns to be silenced." 
</P>
<P>
"He's the person they respect," said Aristides Sanchez, a leading civilian 
adviser to the rebel commanders. "They are religious and he has been their 
protector." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, concerned about their safety as civilians in Nicaragua, greeted 
negotiators with a long list of demands, including one that Sandinista forces 
be disarmed along with their own fighters. 
</P>
<P>
That demand was dropped, Sanchez said, after Chamorro adviser Antonio Lacayo 
assured them that the new president will exercise full control over the armed 
forces after taking office. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the duty of the new government of Nicaragua to watch out for the 
security of our people," Sovalbarro told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra war, which has claimed nearly 30,000 lives, began three years after 
Sandinista guerrillas overthrew the Somoza dictatorship in 1979. The insurgency 
began to fizzle after the U.S. Congress ended military aid in February, 1988.

After a Contra-Sandinista peace accord signed two years ago Friday broke down, 
Central American presidents began pressing the rebels to disarm, in exchange 
for free elections in Nicaragua. The latest regional accord, last Aug. 7, 
created a task force of peacekeeping observers from the United Nations and 
Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
Distrustful of those organizations, the rebels agreed Friday to accept them as 
long as Obando y Bravo worked with them. Ortega said a small U.N. peacekeeping 
force already here will be expanded and start drawing the cease-fire zones, 
while a joint commission of Contra leaders and Chamorro aides works out details 
of the peace accord.

SOUTH AFRICA BREAKING THROUGH DIPLOMATIC BARRIERS;

APARTHEID: DE KLERK'S REFORMS TURN THE TIDE FOR ONCE-SHUNNED REGIME.

The scene in President Frederik W. de Klerk's anteroom this week was his 
government's dream come true: Heads of state and foreign ministers cooled their 
heels for half-hour meetings with South Africa's white leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just flabbergasted by the whole thing," said Alayne Reesberg, a Foreign 
Ministry spokeswoman who watched the parade. "We couldn't even process all the 
requests to see him. If only he'd grow a twin. We could have used one." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a half-century, South African officials have been walked out on, 
stood up, snubbed, burned in effigy and even assaulted by foreigners at 
international forums. 
</P>
<P>
What they have never been is in demand. 
</P>
<P>
But almost every leader attending Namibia's independence festivities this week 
wanted to meet De Klerk, who has released black political expression and 
scheduled "talks about talks" with the African National Congress, the 
government's primary black-nationalist opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In three days, De Klerk met with the presidents or foreign ministers of 19 
countries, most of which have no diplomatic ties with Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the apartheid system of racial segregation became the law in South 
Africa, shortly after World War II, "has there been such a demand from so many 
world leaders to see a South African head of state," South African Foreign 
Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha said, clearly enjoying the brief diplomatic thaw 
occasioned by Namibia's independence. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's meetings marked an important turning point for South Africa's 
white-minority-led government, which has chafed for years under diplomatic 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, people didn't even want to be seen having contact with South 
African politicians," said Michael Hough, director of the Institute for 
Strategic Studies at the University of Pretoria. "But it's not a disgrace to 
talk to them any more. That is an important psychological barrier that's been 
crossed." 
</P>
<P>
None of the foreign leaders promised to establish formal links with South 
Africa or to end international sanctions, imposed because of the apartheid 
system. But there was great interest in De Klerk and his desire to launch 
negotiations with the voteless black majority. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that our aim was a new constitution, which will have the support 
of the majority of all South Africans," De Klerk said. "While white domination 
should come to an end, care should be taken to avoid a situation where one form 
of domination is replaced by another." 
</P>
<P>
However, the recently legalized African National Congress has renewed its call 
on foreign powers to sever diplomatic relations with Pretoria. And ANC Deputy 
President Nelson R. Mandela criticized Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
for traveling to South Africa to see De Klerk this week. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who met Baker and many others in Namibia, maintained that such a 
high-profile visit by Baker, the first by an American secretary of state in 12 
years, would suggest that De Klerk has dismantled key parts of the apartheid 
system, which he hasn't. Baker replied that De Klerk needs to be encouraged to 
continue reform. 
</P>
<P>
However, most world leaders preferred the neutral ground of Namibia, which 
celebrated independence after 75 years of South African colonial rule, to meet 
De Klerk. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was among those who 
held lengthy talks there. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more diplomatically significant meetings were those with South 
Africa's harshest critics. These included the chairman of the Organization of 
African Unity; Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak; the chairman of the Nonaligned 
Movement, Janez Drnovsek, of Yugoslavia, and Nigerian President Ibrahim 
Babangida. 
</P>
<P>
The willingness to talk to De Klerk indicates that Pretoria's image is slowly 
beginning to improve, analysts say. But increasing contact with foreign 
governments also invites pressure on South Africa to move faster on reform, 
they add.

BAKER VISITS SOWETO, VOWS TO URGE END TO 'DISTRESSING' APARTHEID;

SOUTH AFRICA: THE SECRETARY OF STATE ALSO MEETS WITH ANC OFFICIAL WALTER 
SISULU.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, his consciousness sharpened by a quick 
tour of South Africa's largest black township, said Friday that he is 
distressed by what he saw and is even more determined to push for an end to 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
After four days of intense diplomacy in the affluent, swimming-pool-studded 
neighborhoods of South Africa and neighboring Namibia, the trip through Soweto 
marked Baker's first look at the living conditions of southern Africa's 
majority black population. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker had deplored the apartheid system of racial segregation at every 
opportunity, he had not had a chance to look closely at its victims. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite distressing," Baker said. "I think it is necessary for the system 
to be abolished." 
</P>
<P>
Even in Soweto, the sprawling black township of 2.5 million outside 
Johannesburg, Baker spent most of his time with the relatively well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
He breakfasted with anti-apartheid community leaders at a U.S. Information 
Service library, conferred for about an hour with African National Congress 
official Walter Sisulu at Sisulu's modest stuccoed house, watched preschool 
children bounce happily on a trampoline and walked through an education center 
financed by the South African business community. 
</P>
<P>
It was only on a brief drive through the Mshenguville squatters camp that Baker 
confronted the true poverty of tin-and-tar-paper shacks without electricity, 
running water or other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Baker did not stop, viewing through the windows of his limousine the squalor of 
life just 25 miles from the high-rise buildings of Johannesburg and the gold 
mines that help support the South African economy. A motorcade of security 
personnel and reporters followed in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu is a longtime associate of black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, 
and, like Mandela, has spent most of his adult life in South African prisons. 
Sisulu urged the United States to withhold its support for South African 
President Frederik W. de Klerk until the white-minority-led government keeps 
its promise to end apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Mr. De Klerk is making an effort," Sisulu said. "We have 
appreciated the start he has made. We want to urge Mr. De Klerk to be a bit 
speedier about things. The very first stage has not been completed." 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu, recently released after 25 years in prison, talked to reporters after 
showing Baker around the tidy kindergarten that is attended by his 
grandchildren. The school is across the street from Sisulu's house. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the secretary that we are very grateful to the people of America for 
the support they have given us over the years," Sisulu said. "We will expect 
more support as days go by." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials arranged the visit to Soweto to balance Baker's 
talks Thursday in Cape Town with De Klerk and other top officials of the 
government, which marked the end of Washington's diplomatic isolation of South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The visit was planned as a high-visibility "photo opportunity," exploited both 
by the State Department and the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
While Baker was meeting with Sisulu and his wife, Albertina, children at the 
school entertained television crews by shaking their fists and chanting "ANC, 
ANC, ANC" as soon as the cameras began to roll. 
</P>
<P>
The visit gave Baker a chance to renew his acquaintance with Albertina Sisulu, 
an anti-apartheid leader who became the first ANC representative to meet 
President Bush when she visited Washington last year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite De Klerk's liberalizing steps, Sisulu told Baker that conditions for 
blacks remain deplorable. Poor schools and inadequate housing, he said, amount 
to "dynamite for violence." 
</P>
<P>
Although De Klerk's government is scheduled to open unprecedented talks with 
ANC leaders next month, Sisulu said true negotiations over the future of the 
nation cannot begin until the government makes more fundamental changes than it 
has carried out so far. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Soweto is synonymous with the struggle of South Africa's black majority against 
apartheid. The sprawling township outside Johannesburg was the scene of a 
famous, tragic protest by black schoolchildren. On June 16, 1976, thousands of 
them marched against a decree requiring some classes to be taught in Afrikaans, 
the language of the Dutch white minority. When pelted with stones, police 
opened fire, felling Hector Peterson, 13. Riots ensued in what became known as 
the Soweto uprising. Violence spread, and in the next eight months, hundreds 
died in anti-apartheid protests.

THATCHER DETERMINED TO CARRY ON DESPITE BY-ELECTION SETBACK; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: LABOR'S WIN OF A 'SAFE' TORY SEAT MAY REFLECT A TIDE AGAINST HER. BUT 
SHE REJECTS 'TRIMMING AND TURNING.'

A "disappointed" Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that despite one 
of her Conservative Party's most humiliating by-election defeats in more than 
half a century, she will stick to the policies that have kept her in office for 
nearly 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a 'fair-weather' party," the 64-year-old prime minister stated in a 
letter to party Chairman Kenneth Baker. "We are not for trimming and turning." 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives were drubbed at the polls Thursday in a semi-rural 
constituency north of Birmingham where they had enjoyed a large majority at the 
last general election in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Final results announced early Friday showed the rival Labor Party candidate, 
social worker Sylvia Heal, taking 49% of the vote, against 33% for her 
Conservative competitor, publisher Charles Prior. The remaining votes were 
shared among other candidates representing smaller parties. 
</P>
<P>
Heal's 9,449-vote margin of victory marked a stunning turnaround. In 1987, John 
Heddle won the seat for the Conservatives with a 14,654-vote cushion. Heddle's 
suicide last December triggered Thursday's special election to fill his vacant 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was widely seen here as evidence of a powerful anti-Thatcher tide 
among voters that seriously jeopardizes her chances of gaining a fourth term in 
office at the next general election, which must be held before mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said the voting had marked more of a turning 
point for the Conservative Party than for his own. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to have to make up their minds how quickly they get rid of Mrs. 
Thatcher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Baker, the prime minister acknowledged that the voters of the 
Mid-Staffordshire constituency had "taken their chance to send us a message" 
about high mortgage interest rates and an unpopular new local taxing scheme. 
"These matters are naturally of concern to us all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thatcher insisted, "I know that by continuing the policies which have 
served us so well, we will win back the support of the electors of 
Mid-Staffordshire at the next general election." 
</P>
<P>
A close Thatcher aide said the prime minister considered the Mid-Staffordshire 
result to represent a protest rather than a sea-change in the national 
political mood. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling parties here traditionally suffer a slump in the middle of their terms 
of office. They almost always recover somewhat before the next election, 
although sometimes not enough to stay in office. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest British Broadcasting Corp. compilation of the four most 
important polls here, Conservative support nationwide has fallen to 30% from 
45% at the beginning of 1989. The party won the 1987 general election with 
43.3% of the vote. Satisfaction with Thatcher's leadership stands at an 
all-time low of 26%, the BBC said. 
</P>
<P>
What most worries the Conservatives is that the erosion in support has come 
mostly among those people who have been the primary benefactors of Thatcherism: 
young homeowners and skilled workers. They are hit hard by one of Europe's 
highest inflation rates and a government policy of keeping interest rates high 
that has pushed mortgage payments up by several hundred dollars.

DOEMITZ, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As policy makers debate how German unity might come about, the small Elbe River 
town of Doemitz has already made unification a fast-unfolding reality. 
</P>
<P>
The land mines along the border and the death strip that formed part of 
Europe's East-West divide and kept two generations of locals from getting even 
a decent look at the river have been dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
A ferry, leased by the neighboring West German authorities across the river, 
once again links Doemitz with the Elbe's west bank. Work is scheduled to start 
later this year to rebuild the bridge just north of town that was destroyed by 
low-flying American bombers in the final days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the West German Plus and REWE supermarket chains have been 
through, and town officials now talk of transforming an abandoned munitions 
factory site into a Western-backed commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't move fast, events will pass us by," explained the town's affable 
mayor, Helmut Geschwentner. "There's a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
In this once-bustling river port of 3,500, it is easy to feel the powerful 
sense of release from an unhappy past and an urgency to make up for lost time. 
A similar mood in other East and West German communities is helping to drive 
the two Germanys toward each other far faster than expected. 
</P>
<P>
No negotiations are needed here, no formal accords. In Doemitz, unity means 
through traffic and a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we're in the middle of Europe again," said Wolfgang Nowe, an 
instructor at an agricultural college. 
</P>
<P>
But the political change has also brought an emotional roller coaster. On the 
December morning that ferry service began, the town was on such a high that the 
local school principal simply dismissed classes and urged his excited pupils to 
go and watch. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, the mood darkened when the young Communist mayor, Geschwentner's 
predecessor, had a nervous breakdown and resigned. He had defied regional party 
discipline to approve the ferry service, and among his critics in the party 
hierarchy was his own father. 
</P>
<P>
In February, three full months after East Germany's neo-Stalinist regime 
collapsed, residents learned of a secret-police safe house in their midst that 
no one in the close-knit community admits to knowing existed. Since then, 
rumors have bubbled that three or four residents worked as informants, but so 
far there is no proof. 
</P>
<P>
The wounds of a divisive election campaign and nagging doubts about the future 
also have sobered those basking in the glow of their new freedom. A similar 
malaise has unsettled many of East Germany's 16 million people and has led to 
the curious mixture of hope and concern about the future that now grips the 
country. An eagerness to end this uncertainty with swift unification is seen as 
a key reason for the surprising success of the conservative Christian Democrats 
in East Germany's first free elections last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Many here are still trying to get over the shock of viewing their town for the 
first time from the West German side of the Elbe. 
</P>
<P>
"We never knew how fenced in we were," a secretary in the mayor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Nowe, "It was a crushing experience to look back at that fence; it was 
something to be ashamed of. People are still trying to work through what has 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a sense of disillusionment that prominent figures who served the 
Communist order, such as judges and public prosecutors, remain in place. 
Residents say that even those few party officials who have been arrested still 
receive full pay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like de-Nazification, where we saw all those people get their jobs back," 
Nowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these concerns, however, optimism here overrides doubt. West German 
economists believe border towns such as Doemitz will be among the first East 
German communities to reap the economic benefits of unification if residents 
are prepared to commute. 
</P>
<P>
One resident noted that her son, a draftsman, soon would have the choice of 
keeping his current salary of $220 per month or going across the river to earn 
nine times that much doing the same job. 
</P>
<P>
"Commuting could be a very important issue," said Norbert Walter, chief 
economist of West Germany's largest bank, the Deutsche Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The quiet suspicion that greeted a foreign visitor to Doemitz last summer has 
been swept away by the change, replaced instead by smiles and jokes about 
becoming accustomed to traffic noise. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not be as peaceful, but we're just happy the fence is down and we're 
free," retired shop assistant Ritte Wilkens said. 
</P>
<P>
Amid this freedom, the process of knitting East and West Germany together goes 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Residents talk of Hamburg once again becoming the nearest city for big shopping 
trips, of re-establishing ties with Dannenberg across the river and of school 
visits to far-off places. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 10 cars in the Town Hall parking lot on a recent day carried West 
German license plates, and West German tourists stroll around with cameras, 
some returning for the first time since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Six small, state-owned building industry enterprises have restructured 
themselves as a single public company and already are taking delivery of 
materials, apparently on credit, from a family-owned West German firm. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Geschwentner, that family holds the original title to the 
property on which the six enterprises sit. 
</P>
<P>
"This just happened last week," he said with a smile. "In five years, we'll be 
prosperous. We'll have the bridge. Then we'll be as we were."

Fugitive Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar on Friday denied the government's 
contention that he was behind the assassination of leftist presidential 
candidate Bernardo Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the Patriotic Union, Diego Montana Cuellar, meanwhile, said in 
a televised interview Friday on the news program Cinevision that his party is 
withdrawing from the May 27 general elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriotic Union, Conservative and Communist parties all asked the governing 
Liberal Party of President Virgilio Barco Vargas to postpone the elections, 
saying they fear for the safety of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The government, fearing the start of a new offensive by drug traffickers, 
strengthened security in the capital, Bogota, after street demonstrations 
Thursday by protesters accusing the government of complicity in the murder. 
Jaramillo, the candidate for the Patriotic Union Party, was gunned down at the 
main Bogota airport Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone caller who claimed the assassination for the Medellin cocaine 
cartel said Cesar Gaviria, the Liberal Party presidential candidate, would be 
the next victim. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo's body was to lie in state in the National Capitol until it is flown 
today to his hometown of Manizales, 120 miles west of Bogota, for services. 
</P>
<P>
An official government communique released Thursday accused Escobar, reputed 
head of the Medellin cocaine cartel, of hiring the teen-ager accused of 
carrying out the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would I attack someone who has always shown himself to be in favor of 
dialogue with drug traffickers?" Escobar wrote in a letter to UP leader Montana 
made public Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the gunman was paid about $650 or $750 in advance by the 
Medellin cartel to kill Jaramillo, who was on his way to a Caribbean holiday 
with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Escobar, a high-living billionaire, is the cocaine trafficker 
most wanted for extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo, 38, died in a Bogota hospital two hours after being shot four times 
in the chest and stomach by the assassin firing a submachine gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The government identified the gunman, seized at the airport, as Andres Arturo 
Gutierrez of Bogota. He had not been charged.

U.S. PROPOSES RULES TO UPGRADE NURSING HOME AIDES' TRAINING

Federal health officials Friday proposed long-awaited rules for nursing homes 
requiring that nurses aides meet competency standards and that residents be 
screened for mental illness and retardation. 
</P>
<P>
The rules proposed by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan 
carry out some of the major nursing home reforms enacted by Congress in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We've waited a very long time to get these regulations. They are incredibly 
important," said Barbara Frank, associate director of the National Citizens 
Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, a consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, states would develop training and competency standards for 
nurses aides and publish lists of those who met the requirements -- as well as 
aides found to have abused or neglected patients or stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
As of Oct. 1, nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid could employ 
only aides who met the standards. Training would have to be given free to 
workers, and there are some exceptions for people already hired. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said that the law was needed because "a lot of nursing homes hire people 
directly off the street without giving them proper supervision or training." 
</P>
<P>
People entering nursing homes would be tested for mental retardation and 
illness, and residents would be screened annually to make sure they are not 
being "warehoused" in such facilities, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
When a person who has been a resident of a nursing home for less than 30 months 
is found to be mentally ill or retarded, the state must arrange or provide 
treatment at a more appropriate facility. Longer-term residents could receive 
treatment without moving from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the mentally ill and retarded have favored such measures, saying 
thousands of nursing home residents should be in other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"There are far too many people with mental retardation living in nursing homes 
who are not receiving the care they need," said Martha Ford of the Assn. for 
Retarded Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns have been raised, however, that people turned away because they are 
mentally ill or retarded will not receive any care and could wind up homeless.

<P>
Only two years ago, a Navy commander who had done a bang-up job of training 
Bolivian naval officers to run anti-drug river patrols turned down an offer to 
extend his six-month tour with the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
As a career move, "it would have been to his detriment to continue to assist 
us," recalled DEA Administrator John C. Lawn, who was so pleased with the 
commander's performance that he had personally urged him to extend his 
temporary assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, a stint with the DEA, as part of the military's expanded 
participation in federal anti-drug efforts, would be viewed as career-enhancing 
instead of damaging, Lawn said. Although the military has had to adjust to its 
role in the drug fight, the joint effort is starting to mesh, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawn, in an interview this week marking his career switch from federal drug 
enforcement chief to New York Yankees executive, discussed the military 
campaign and his "sense" that President Bush will break with precedent by not 
turning to the FBI to find Lawn's successor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he underscored the renewed threat to the United States of heroin 
smuggling, rejecting suggestions by critics that the DEA's warnings about 
heroin were motivated by the desire for a bigger budget. 
</P>
<P>
Lawn's praise of military cooperation was voiced a week after the Pentagon 
announced unprecedented drug-interdiction initiatives, including an increase in 
the number of military personnel assigned to full-time details with other 
federal agencies involved in the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
Only 40 U.S. military personnel served with drug-fighting units of the Justice 
and Commerce departments in 1989, but about 275 will be assigned to those 
agencies this year. 
</P>
<P>
More significant than those numbers, however, is a change of attitude that Lawn 
said stemmed from the emphasis placed on anti-drug work by Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's a two-year assignment and it's career-enhancing," Lawn said. As a 
result, he said, it is in an officer's "best interest to seek out such an 
assignment." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the expanded role of the military in anti-drug campaigns has caused 
some headaches. The Navy's plan to station a drug-interdicting armada off the 
coast of Colombia was denounced by Latin American leaders and was shelved. 
</P>
<P>
"The military are take-charge people," Lawn said, "so there was a learning 
curve and sensitivity training that the military and intelligence communities 
had to go through." 
</P>
<P>
Military officials "had to recognize that sovereignty issues are most important 
and that the role of the DEA is not unilateral enforcement action, but one of 
working with local counterparts" overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that the military planners remembered the difficulties of 
Southeast Asia (Vietnam) and felt that, if given the mission, they should carry 
it out without guidance from other components that had been involved," Lawn 
continued. "That period of sensitivity training is over, and the military and 
intelligence communities clearly understand the role they will be playing." 
</P>
<P>
Lawn said that he did not expect the President to turn to the FBI when choosing 
the next DEA chief, although both Lawn and his predecessor, Francis (Bud) 
Mullen, were veteran FBI officials before taking command of the drug agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The visibility of the DEA in Congress and at the White House is now such that 
I believe the candidates will be individuals of substantially higher visibility 
than people from a domestic law enforcement environment," Lawn said. 
</P>
<P>
By moving outside the FBI to find Lawn's replacement, Bush would underscore the 
independence of the DEA, which, during President Ronald Reagan's 
Administration, was often regarded as a subordinate unit of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Lawn said that he had been asked to "be available" to discuss the job's 
requirements when Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh begins drawing up the list of 
possible nominees to recommend to Bush, a process that Lawn and a Justice 
Department spokesman said has not begun. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Thornburgh picked the DEA's second-ranking official, Terrence 
Burke, to become acting administrator after Lawn officially departed on Friday. 
Burke, 51, has held several DEA posts and served overseas with both the drug 
agency and the CIA, which awarded him the Intelligence Star of Valor, the 
civilian equivalent of the Medal of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
Lawn, who is retiring after 27 years of government service, will become vice 
president and chief of operations for the Yankees. He is an acquaintance of 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and will handle business affairs for the 
team.

MOYNIHAN TAX CUT PLAN GETS BOOST FROM PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DEMOCRATS ON LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEE PRAISE 
PROPOSAL TO TRIM LEVY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. BACKERS SEE CAMPAIGN ADVANTAGES.

<P>
Democratic leaders acted on two fronts Friday to seize the initiative in the 
national economic policy debate with President Bush by promoting a 
controversial proposal to cut the Social Security payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
In New Orleans, the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrist elected 
officials, gave a warm reception to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), 
author of the controversial proposal to reduce the payroll tax from the current 
6.2% to 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan, whose appearance highlighted the opening session of the council's 
two-day policy conference, charged that the Bush Administration was "looting" 
the Social Security trust fund to help reduce the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"You could go to jail in other walks of life for doing that," Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan's proposed rate cut would provide workers who earn the Social Security 
maximum -- $54,300 in 1991 -- with a tax savings of $600 a year. It would put 
Social Security on more of a pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the surpluses now 
being used to defray the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) praised the Moynihan approach for reducing the 
tax burden on middle-income taxpayers and for protecting the trust fund. "If we 
(Democrats) don't stand for those principles, what do we stand for?" Penny 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Indianapolis, the Democratic National Committee moved toward 
adoption of a resolution endorsing the Moynihan proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, submitted by New York state party chairman John Marino at the 
instigation of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, was taken up Friday by the DNC executive 
committee. It was expected to receive the backing of the full DNC, the party's 
governing body, at today's's session. 
</P>
<P>
Flying to New Orleans from Indianapolis for a brief visit, Democratic National 
Committee Chairman Ron Brown called the Moynihan plan "a stroke of genius." 
Brown said that Moynihan "has touched a real nerve by daring the Administration 
to come clean and admit to what they've been up to." 
</P>
<P>
As Brown and other backers of the Moynihan plan pointed out, the New York 
senator's proposal offers Democrats several political advantages. 
</P>
<P>
First, it focuses attention on the Bush Administration's use of the Social 
Security trust fund, which has been growing steadily in recent years, to reduce 
the size of the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it helps Democrats shed their traditional reputation as tax boosters by 
casting them as tax cutters instead. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it could strengthen the appeal of the Democrats among lower- and 
middle-income wage earners, who Moynihan contends bear an unfair share of the 
nation's tax burden and who have defected from the Democratic Party in large 
numbers in the past three presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to have a floor debate on cutting Social Security versus cutting 
capital gains," said Democratic House Whip William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, 
referring to Bush's proposal to reduce capital gains taxes to spur economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Gray predicted that if Moynihan's proposal reaches the House floor it would 
pass overwhelmingly. "This is good policy, and it's good politics, too," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all participants in the Democratic Leadership Council session were 
enthusiastic about the Moynihan plan. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.) cautioned Democrats that "we should be careful in 
our glee and excitement" until a way has been devised to offset the decline in 
general revenues, which would significantly widen the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
By Moynihan's calculations, his proposal would cause a loss of $62 billion in 
tax revenues over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Another objection was raised by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee, who worried that enactment of the Moynihan plan would 
touch off "a tax cut bidding war" between Democrats and Republicans in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Friday's developments represented the biggest boost for 
Moynihan's proposal since he introduced it late last year to the surprise and 
consternation of many Republicans and some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who voiced objections to specific aspects of the Moynihan plan 
indicated they would be willing to consider a modified form of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen, for example, said he would study the possibility of simply rolling 
back the payroll tax increase that went into effect this year, when the payroll 
tax rate jumped from 6.06% to 6.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House majority leader who is heading a 
task force to develop a Democratic tax strategy, said he could not predict 
whether the Moynihan proposal would receive widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
But Gephardt said Moynihan had "tapped two very important issues," by focusing 
attention on the use of the Social Security trust fund and the tax burden on 
middle-class wage earners. "Democrats are going to try to embody these themes 
in the positions they take," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The generally positive reaction to the Moynihan plan at the New Orleans meeting 
contrasted with a lack of visible interest in a deficit reduction plan offered 
two weeks ago by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski proposed freezing most government spending programs, including 
cost of living increases for Social Security beneficiaries, while raising taxes 
on oil, pollutants, alcohol and tobacco. Many Democrats regard the proposal as 
politically risky, particularly in the absence of strong backing from the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Moynihan proposal has been sharply criticized by the Bush Administration. 
Budget Director Richard G. Darman has contended that by increasing the budget 
deficit, the plan risks "fiscal policy havoc." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has labeled the plan "a charade" designed to get him to raise income taxes 
to meet the increased burden on the deficit.

An oil tanker spilled about 150 gallons of oil into the Delaware River on 
Friday, the Coast Guard reported. Workers at the Sun Co. refinery dock noticed 
the spill as the 865-foot tanker Nike was unloading its cargo of light crude 
oil from Nigeria, officials said.

SEARCH ENDS FOR 9 ON CAPSIZED BOAT

Coast Guard on Friday suspended its search for the bodies of nine men presumed 
drowned after their fishing trawler capsized and sank in the frigid Bering Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing vessels rescued 22 crew members who had abandoned the sinking ship on 
lifeboats. 
</P>
<P>
They were reported in good condition aboard a trawler that was taking them to 
Dutch Harbor, about 250 miles southeast of the accident site. 
</P>
<P>
The nine were lost Thursday when the 162-foot Aleutian Enterprise sank, 
according to the Coast Guard, which said there was little chance that their 
bodies would be found. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a very good search yesterday," Lt. Brian Flory said Friday. "We think 
we would have found anyone who was afloat." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the sinking was unknown, said Christopher Haley, a Coast Guard 
spokesman. Weather was reported to be fair when the early afternoon accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
None of the crew was wearing survival suits, Haley said. Coast Guard officials 
said a person could not survive the frigid 32- to 34-degree water more than 30 
minutes without insulated survival gear.

WITNESS SAYS POINDEXTER DID NOT HIDE MISSILE DEAL;

IRAN-CONTRA: BUT CIA OFFICIAL TESTIFIES FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE OMITTED FACTS

A veteran CIA official testified Friday that former National Security Adviser 
John M. Poindexter did not attempt to cover up a controversial 1985 shipment of 
U.S. Hawk missiles to Iran that led to the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
But Norman H. Gardner Jr., a congressional specialist for the CIA who was 
present when Poindexter briefed members of Congress in 1986, said that 
Poindexter omitted some facts during the session, including former President 
Ronald Reagan's written authorization of the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner appeared as a defense witness as Poindexter's trial completed its third 
week. The former White House official is charged with five felonies for 
allegedly conspiring to cover up the scandal, obstructing congressional 
inquiries and making false statements to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the counts involve charges that Poindexter misled members of the House 
and Senate intelligence committees by falsely claiming that neither he nor any 
other U.S. official had prior knowledge of a shipment of U.S. Hawk missiles 
from Israel to Iran in November, 1985. The arms shipment was intended to help 
free U.S. hostages in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prosecution presented earlier witnesses to back up the charges, 
Gardner said that Poindexter told legislators during the Nov. 21, 1986, meeting 
that "we did not have all the facts about that flight" and that some U.S. 
officials may have had prior knowledge of it. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner conceded that Poindexter, however, never told members of Congress about 
Reagan's written authorization for the 1985 shipment, known as a presidential 
"finding." 
</P>
<P>
"Did anyone ask him about a finding?" inquired Joseph Small, a lawyer for 
Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
"No, they did not," Gardner replied. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner said that Reagan signed the finding, which was drafted by the CIA, two 
months after the shipment on Jan. 17, 1986. Other witnesses have said the CIA 
recommended the presidential action because Congress had forbidden any shipment 
of U.S. arms to nations that supported terrorism unless the President issued a 
finding that such a shipment was in the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
Previous evidence at the trial has shown that Poindexter tore up the finding in 
late November, 1986, because it linked the arms shipment to attempts to free 
U.S. hostages, a statement that conflicted with Reagan's pledge that he would 
not negotiate for hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner drew an expression of skepticism from U.S. District Judge Harold H. 
Greene when he said a chronology that Poindexter had helped prepare stated 
truthfully that the CIA believed the shipment contained oil-drilling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"The CIA shipped something to Iran, to a hostile country that was almost at war 
with the United States, and the CIA didn't know what was in there?" Greene 
asked, frowning. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right," Gardner replied. 
</P>
<P>
He said that at the request of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, an aide to 
Poindexter, the CIA arranged for one of its chartered airlines to fly the 
shipment from Israel to Iran. North had described the cargo as oil-drilling 
equipment, Gardner explained. 
</P>
<P>
At the last moment, however, the crew of the airplane became aware that the 
cargo was actually missiles and reported that information to CIA headquarters, 
he testified. 
</P>
<P>
But on cross-examination, associate prosecutor Christian Mixter pointed out 
that one CIA chronology reported that the agency first learned of the cargo 
from the Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner testified this was incorrect, declaring: "There was a great deal of 
confusion about the flight."

VAN DE KAMP DEFENDS AD CRITICIZING FEINSTEIN RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial candidate John K. Van de Kamp Friday defended a new TV 
commercial that he is running, saying that its criticism of Dianne Feinstein 
was designed to present parts of her record as San Francisco mayor that she had 
left out of her own commercial last month. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than defend all six charges in his ad, Van de Kamp chose to focus on 
one: the projection by Feinstein's successor, Mayor Art Agnos, that the city 
would have a $180-million budget deficit for fiscal 1988-89. Agnos blames the 
projected deficit on her spending policies in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, who left office in January, 1988, blames the projected deficit on 
factors beyond her control, including the settlement of expensive lawsuits 
against the city. 
</P>
<P>
To which Van de Kamp said Friday in Santa Monica: "Clearly, one of the two 
Democratic candidates for governor is either wrong or simply being untruthful." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp then issued a challenge to Feinstein to clear up the questions of 
responsibility for the budget deficit matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll put up one-half of the money it would require to have any of the Big 8 
accounting firms resolve the issue . . . Dianne Feinstein can put up the other 
half." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein adviser William Carrick responded: "This is basically a hotdog 
maneuver designed to pump up John Van de Kamp's failing campaign, and we're not 
playing that game. Standard and Poor's of New York gave the city an AA rating 
in August, 1988, months after Dianne left office, and said the following: 'The 
AA rating also reflects management's willingness to adhere to sound fiscal 
policies.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although Van de Kamp said last fall that "people are tired of negative 
campaigns, tired of negative candidates," his new ad criticizing Feinstein's 
record is definitely in the negative category. 
</P>
<P>
But a Times analysis of the six specific charges in the ad found that Van de 
Kamp had taken some liberties with Feinstein's nine-year record as mayor, 
blaming her for some problems left by the late Mayor George Moscone, problems 
she moved to solve in her tenure.

VIETNAMESE EDITOR LATEST TO BE THREATENED BY RIGHTISTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The editor of one of the largest Vietnamese-language newspapers in the United 
States has received a death threat from a right-wing group. 
</P>
<P>
The typewritten communique accuses editor Yen Ngoc Do and several other 
prominent Vietnamese-Americans of unspecified pro-Communist activities. It 
threatens to execute them on April 30, the 15th anniversary of the fall of 
Saigon, unless they stop their activities. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is the latest in a barrage of threats, beatings, arsons and 
shootings by right-wing groups. Since 1980 their targets have included 
Vietnamese-Americans who either advocate normalization of relations between the 
United States and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam or are otherwise perceived 
to be less-than-zealous anti-Communists. One of Do's trucks was set ablaze last 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the death threat were mailed to at least 20 newspapers and community 
groups in Orange County and San Jose. The letter was released to The Times by a 
community activist who hoped that public attention would prompt authorities to 
crack down on violent extremists. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose attorney Liem Huu Nguyen, who was also named in the death threat, said 
Friday that the violence has succeeded in silencing political discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of unofficial censorship stronger than any kind of government 
censorship that I know," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese refugees have intently followed the collapse of Communism in Eastern 
Europe, upheaval in the Soviet Union and Vietnam's recent policy of doi moi, or 
liberalization, which some hope will pave the way for better relations with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese-American conservatives oppose establishing diplomatic relations, 
ending economic sanctions or lifting travel restrictions unless democratic 
reforms are enacted. They have publicly denounced doi moi as a "fake." 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible to say anything reasonable or moderate under these 
circumstances," said Nguyen, who advocates closer ties. "The idea of 
anti-Communism to these people is to kill all the Communists." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, after a Garden Grove newspaper publisher died in an arson fire, the 
FBI announced an investigation into political violence in Vietnamese exile 
communities in the United States. No arrests have been made. Los Angeles FBI 
spokesman Jim Nielson declined any comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As editor of the Westminster-based Nguoi Viet Daily News, which appears six 
days a week and reports a circulation of 10,000, Do said he has been threatened 
and warned to "keep quiet." His car was vandalized three times last year and 
once this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last April 24, arsonists set fire to a Nguoi Viet pick-up truck and scrawled a 
threat in Vietnamese on the newspaper's wall: "Nguoi Viet, if you are VC (Viet 
Cong) we kill." 
</P>
<P>
Do said Friday he does not know what prompted the latest threat. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated March 13 with a Santa Ana postmark, was signed by a group 
that has not been heard from before. It warns that priests, intellectuals, 
journalists and businessmen "have tried to work with the Communists because 
they think the Communists are now changing," an apparent reference to doi moi. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, the San Jose attorney, advocated reconciliation between the United 
States and Vietnam at a conference in August.

County residents have taken to changing and/or making additions to their homes 
at a furious rate. Last year the value of residential alterations and additions 
was $240 million, an increase of 26% from 1988 (or 22% in inflation-adjusted 
dollars). The increase is a continuation of the upward trend in residential 
alteration spending, in place since 1985 and almost double the amount of 1984. 
Last year's figure is highest in the county in 10 years.

<P>
There are some exceptions to the countywide trend, though, as valuations in 
Brea, Laguna Beach, La Palma and the unincorporated areas dropped below their 
1988 levels. During 1989, the city recording the largest amount on such 
residential changes was Anaheim, with $28 million, or 12% of the county total. 
Here's how the various cities compared:

DISCOVERY: LOS ALAMITOS MUSEUM

The Los Alamitos Museum will appeal to those who like to prowl through attics, 
looking at old photographs, award certificates, medals and memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
The displays lack a central focus, but perhaps that is what gives the museum 
its charm. Housed in an old adobe brick fire station on Los Alamitos Boulevard, 
it serves as a community storehouse of assorted memories. 
</P>
<P>
Most items on display date from the late 1800s. Tools from the community's 
first woodworking and blacksmith shops are there, including the blacksmith's 
well-worn leather apron. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the room is the cross that stood atop the Community Congregational 
Church, built in 1896. The building was torn down in 1966, and the cross is all 
that remains. A sign informs visitors that the bullet holes in it "attest to 
the shooting skills of early Los Alamitos residents." 
</P>
<P>
The history of the Los Alamitos Sugar Co. is documented in a photographic 
display. During its prime, the once-thriving industry produced 300,000 sacks of 
sugar each year, made from locally grown beets. The evolution of Los Alamitos 
is depicted as well, since the sugar industry, which began in 1897, changed it 
from a farming community to a boom town. The factory, which employed 300, 
closed in 1925 after a soil infection ruined the crops. 
</P>
<P>
Also located in the museum is the Los Alamitos Hall of Fame, which resembles a 
family trophy collection. Included in the displays set up to honor local 
athletes are tributes to distance swimmer Lynne Cox, diver Pat McCormick and 
gymnast Cathy Rigby. Cox, who swam the Bering Strait from Alaska to the Soviet 
Union in 1987, plans to symbolically link the two Germanys in May by swimming 
the Spree River through East and West Berlin. McCormick and Rigby competed in 
the Olympic Games and are still active promoters of U.S. Olympic activities. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hall of Fame is not just for athletes. Space is being made to honor 
Myldred Jones, a Los Alamitos resident who founded Casa De Bienvenidos, a local 
youth shelter. 
</P>
<P>
An interesting sidelight is the antique medical equipment, including a 
physician's portable pharmacy. The black leather kit contains vials of every 
pharmaceutical compound available at the time of its manufacture in the early 
1900s. The kit was taken along on house calls and prescriptions were prepared 
by the physician at the patient's bedside. The medical equipment was never used 
in Los Alamitos but was donated by two local collectors. The old-fashioned 
stethoscopes, ether masks, surgical needles, extractors and glass hypodermics 
provide an oddly fascinating display. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 2 to 4 p.m. Tuesdays and Sundays. Special tours available by 
appointment.

U.S. RENEWS CALL TO KEEP DRUG SUSPECT IN BAJA JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned that one of the most wanted men in Orange County's war on drugs is 
being released illegally from a prison in La Paz, U.S. officials in Mexico said 
Friday that they have renewed a protest to keep the suspect jailed until 
attempts to extradite him have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials said they have complained to Mexico's Foreign Ministry 
that Daniel James Fowlie, 57, the accused patriarch of a vast drug-smuggling 
operation, has been periodically released from Centro de Readaptacion Social to 
go fishing and take care of personal business. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reports that he has been let out of prison and we are very concerned 
about those releases," said a U.S. Embassy officer in Mexico City, who 
requested anonymity. "He is supposed to stay in jail." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Thursday that Fowlie, who has been contesting his 
extradition for three years, has been granted furloughs to go marlin fishing, 
visit his beachfront house and work on real estate projects in Cabo San Lucas, 
a burgeoning resort on the tip of Baja California. The popular spot for 
American sportsmen is about 140 miles from La Paz, where Fowlie is imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. Embassy officials, American citizens detained in Mexican 
prisons while contesting their extradition to the United States are not 
supposed to be released until the proceedings have been concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie, whose alleged drug-smuggling ring was headquartered on a secluded 
ranch, has been fighting his extradition to Orange County on 49 drug charges 
since his capture by Mexican agents south of Acapulco in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that 
Fowlie smuggled hundreds of thousands of pounds of marijuana and lesser amounts 
of cocaine into the United States through Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Once the drugs were in the United States, prosecutors charge that Fowlie and 
others processed and packaged them at Rancho del Rio, a 213-acre Orange County 
ranch with 12 structures built of imported logs, tile and river rock. 
</P>
<P>
So far, five people, including Fowlie's two sons, have been convicted in 
connection with the alleged scheme, and his rustic property on some of the 
county's most valuable undeveloped land has been confiscated under federal 
asset-seizure laws. The ranch was used by President Bush as a backdrop for a 
national address on drugs last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators also say that Fowlie is important to them because he 
might know about the reputed drug lords who are suspected in the 
torture-slaying of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique Camarena 
Salazar in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated attempts over two days, the commandant of Centro de 
Readaptacion Social could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But a Mexican official familiar with the Fowlie extradition case said it would 
be improper for prison officials to grant the suspect even a temporary release. 
</P>
<P>
"The correct thing is for him to stay; the incorrect thing is for him to 
leave," said Sergio Padilla, a judicial director of the Foreign Ministry's 
political affairs department. Padilla added that he did not know the details of 
Fowlie's incarceration and was not authorized to discuss any protests by U.S. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie, who told The Times in an interview that he has been released from 
prison on several occasions, denied any impropriety and said his periodic 
releases are legitimate work furloughs. He said he has never tried to escape 
and is always escorted by an armed guard from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City first lodged a formal complaint with the 
Mexican government in November after a U.S. vice consul from Tijuana visited 
the prison and demanded to see Fowlie. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy officials said a prison guard told the vice consul that Fowlie was away 
from the prison, but Mexican authorities later denied that he was absent. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Friday that they renewed their complaint, using information 
from The Times' article detailing Fowlie's releases from prison. In addition, 
officials said, the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana has been instructed to again 
attempt to determine whether Fowlie has been periodically released from 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Usually granted four-day passes, Fowlie retires to a rock-and-tile house he 
built on secluded beach property where his prized pit bulls stand guard and 
passing gray whales blow clouds of mist into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie is a man of several talents; his engineering skills and construction 
equipment have been enlisted by a Mexican real estate company with plans for a 
shopping center. And the bar association of Baja California commissioned him to 
paint a long-eared horned owl for Carlos Salinas Gortari, the president of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In prison, Fowlie wears his own clothes, usually jeans and flannel shirts. He 
is on a first-name basis with the staff, and the atmosphere in the prison yard 
is more akin to a city park. To help him take care of businesses on the 
outside, his Jeep Cherokee is parked on prison grounds and he has hired an 
errand boy for $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie said he was granted periodic passes from prison in 1988, but the 
privileges were suspended until last December. Since then, his releases have 
resumed because of a recent Mexican court decision opposing his extradition, he 
said. It is not known how many times he has been released. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, officials have never heard of any 
court decision rejecting the United States' extradition request, but 
information about court rulings is sometimes unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, officials said, a federal judge in La Paz ruled that it would be 
possible to extradite Fowlie. Embassy status reports on Fowlie's case show that 
he lost two other appeals of decisions approving his return and the issue is 
now before the Mexican Supreme Court for a final ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Experts in Mexican law and U.S. diplomats say that Fowlie's conditions of 
confinement during his extradition proceedings are typical of people who have 
money, prominence or the persuasiveness to convince authorities that they will 
not escape if released for short periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not supposed to leave the facility. They have everything they need 
there. My reaction is that this is clearly irregular," said professor Jorge A. 
Vargas, director of the Mexico-U.S. Law Institute at the University of San 
Diego School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
If Fowlie is being released improperly, Vargas said, it could trigger a "very 
serious" investigation by Mexico's judicial authorities, including the attorney 
general's office and Ministry of the Interior. Specifically, he said, there 
might be violations of the country's Penitentiary Act, which spells out the 
rights of inmates and the duties of prison authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not surprised," said Enrique Ramirez, a San Diego attorney who 
specializes in Mexican law. "It sounds to me like he's got the kind of benefits 
that money can bring you. And, if that is the case, he is going to have to keep 
paying for them."

MYSTERIOUS AILMENT TAKES A HEAVY TOLL AMONG THAIS; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHEAST ASIA: THE SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED NOCTURNAL DEATH SYNDROME HAS KILLED 
HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN. DOCTORS REMAIN BAFFLED.

<P>
A decade-old medical mystery that has confounded investigators in the United 
States and Southeast Asia by killing young, apparently healthy Asian men in 
their sleep has taken a new turn with the deaths in a single day of two Thai 
construction workers in the island republic of Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, Wichit Khamwaen, 45, and Sitthi Sataisong, 27, apparently died in 
their sleep before dawn Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sitthi's roommate told authorities that Sitthi had trouble breathing during the 
night, but he could not revive him. 
</P>
<P>
A third Thai died Wednesday, bringing to 13 the number of Thai workers who have 
died this year in Singapore under similar mysterious circumstances -- heart 
failure in the middle of the night, with no apparent symptoms or causes. 
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Ministry of Health said in a statement Sunday that about 200 
young Thais have died of the mysterious illness since 1983; about 20 young and 
seemingly healthy Thais died last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have told the 
Singaporeans of similar deaths in the United States involving Southeast Asian 
immigrants. The U.S. deaths from the so-called Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal 
Death syndrome average nearly four a month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Thai Ministry of Labor reported Wednesday that of the 1,000 
Thais who have died in Saudi Arabia in the past two decades, about 60% died of 
unexplained heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The unexplained deaths have stunned the estimated 200,000 Thais in Singapore, 
where they provide mainly low-cost labor as domestic servants and construction 
workers. Concern is so great that the Thai government dispatched a team of 
medical investigators from the Public Health Ministry to Singapore last week, 
but they returned home Tuesday without having solved the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come up with any conclusion," said Ong-art Klamphaiboon, the public 
health official who led the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Ong-art said the circumstances of the deaths in the Singapore cases appeared 
similar to those reported among Southeast Asians in the United States, a large 
percentage of whom live in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
One clue that was examined and then rejected was a method used by Thai 
construction workers to cook sticky rice, a staple of their diet. The workers 
used sections of plastic pipe as a steamer for the rice. When burned, the 
plastic material, also known as PVC, can give off poisonous gases. 
</P>
<P>
But Handrick Ng of the Singapore Health Ministry said the Thai workers were not 
raising the pipes to sufficiently high temperature to produce those gases. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible link being investigated is that all of the men who have died 
in Singapore are apparently from the same northeastern region of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Ng said researchers are considering the possibility that the workers succumbed 
because of some reaction to stressful work in the different climate. Northeast 
Thailand is primarily highland terrain, while Singapore is flat and tropical.

ARMBANDS PROTEST HARRIS EXECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Orange County courtrooms and at the offices of the public defender, black 
armbands are becoming a familiar sight. 
</P>
<P>
And if attorneys Denise Gragg and Roger Alexander have their way, many more 
armbands will be visible before the planned April execution of Robert Alton 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to attract attention to the first person to be put to death in the 
California gas chamber since 1967, Gragg and Alexander, who are both deputy 
public defenders, began passing out armbands last week. Harris, who is 
scheduled to die April 3, was sentenced to death for the 1978 murders of two 
San Diego teen-agers. "We just felt so helpless about the whole death penalty 
issue," Gragg said. "We are hoping that the armbands will at least start people 
thinking and talking about what the death penalty really means." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Public Defender Carl Holmes says most of the 120 attorneys in the 
office are wearing the armbands because they deal directly with clients put on 
death row. 
</P>
<P>
Several attorneys from the public defender's office say they will attend the 
all-night vigil for Harris at San Quentin April 2. "We are stressing that 
murder is wrong no matter who commits it, and that the public should understand 
the reality of that," Alexander said. ALLISON SAMUELS

HONIG TELLS PLAN TO STEER MORE TO COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State superintendent of public instruction Bill Honig on Friday detailed an 
ambitious partnership plan between community colleges and high schools, aimed 
at steering 25% of high school graduates to four-year universities and another 
25% to community colleges or technical schools by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before educators gathered at the Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa 
Mesa for a "Plus in Partnership" conference, Honig warned that the plan cannot 
work unless educators make "a radical shift in the way we do business." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to reconstruct our entire curriculum," Honig said in his 
luncheon address. "We're going to have to redevelop courses. . . . We're going 
to have to make structural changes within our classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership plan -- known in education circles as "articulation," or a 
planned process linking together two or more educational systems -- calls for 
teachers at both levels to form curricula that will smooth the transition 
between high school and college or technical school. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring will also help direct students bound for four-year colleges 
to the appropriate high school courses to pursue career goals. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, Honig said, is to raise the percentage of high school graduates 
seeking bachelor's degrees from current levels of about 12% to 25% by the year 
2000, and of those seeking associate's degrees or completion of technical 
school from the current 19% to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate plan, Honig said the state hopes to develop partnerships with 
business that would steer an additional 40% of graduates directly to the 
workplace, leaving a projected dropout rate of about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make it in this country on how effectively we get these kids 
into technical jobs," Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said partnership programs between high schools and community colleges 
should be geared toward four areas of academic achievement: basic academic 
skills, helping students develop personal goals, training students to work in 
groups (or "cooperative learning") and specific technical training. 
</P>
<P>
David Mertes, chancellor of the state's community colleges, preceded Honig at 
the podium and said educators will "have to rise to new levels of interaction 
with each other" to succeed in bridging the gap between secondary schools and 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
He also said concerted efforts by college and business recruiters must be "an 
ongoing act" if students are to be comfortably eased into institutions of 
higher learning or the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said that while teachers, administrators and businessmen facing a severe 
shortage of technical workers are eager to start the program, developing lines 
of communications among institutions will be difficult and take time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about institutions that have never worked together," Honig said 
after his address. "We're talking about making teachers at two different levels 
jointly responsible for 100 students." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the potential obstacles, Honig added, educators throughout the state 
are "very excited" about the partnership plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to say to you that it is very high on our agenda," Honig told the 
audience. TONY MARCANO

GIRLS' DRILL TEAM EARNS TRIP TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach High School girls' drill team has wowed judges at 
competitions during the past six months, including an outing last week that has 
earned it a ticket to take the show overseas this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-member squad will perform today in the USA Nationals at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the team's first appearance since winning the large drill team 
division title at last Saturday's prestigious Miss Drill Team USA. That victory 
earned the division's national championship and a berth, along with teams from 
17 other high schools across the country, in the international finals to be 
held in August in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
It marks the first invitation the school has ever received to the international 
competition. The 1984-85 team won the Miss Drill Team USA title but that was a 
year before the worldwide finals were instituted. 
</P>
<P>
This year's squad has placed first in the large military division of each of 
its six competitions during 1989-90. If the squad wins today and again at its 
final event next month, it will complete its first season without a loss since 
the championship squad of five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The key to this team's success, said first-year coach Linda Stewart, has been 
the girls' discipline. The girls practice as a full squad three hours per 
night, five nights a week, in addition to five extra hours' minimum they are 
required to work in their smaller groups, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the squad's time the next four months will be devoted to raising money 
for the Japan trip, which will cost $900 per person, she said. The team has 
held several fund-raisers already this year, and earlier this week Stewart 
formally requested a grant from the city. City officials have yet to respond to 
the request. JOHN PENNER

CHP GOLD ZEROES IN ON SPEEDING TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officials in Santa Ana on Friday unveiled a new, 
well-disguised squad car that they hope will help slow down speeding big-rig 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The new car, which is painted gold with white doors instead of the traditional 
black-and-white, is one of 16 Highway Patrol cars being deployed up and down 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
The cars will be driven by CHP officers in full uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Injury and fatal accidents in which a truck driver was at fault have climbed by 
nearly 68%, from 3,320 in 1982 to 5,565 in 1988, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the CHP conducted a yearlong pilot program in which specially marked 
vehicles were assigned to five freeway segments with heavy truck traffic, 
including Santa Ana and Westminster. State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) 
authored legislation ordering the study. The program reduced the number of 
truck-caused injury accidents by 11.2% compared to the previous year. Fatal 
accidents caused by trucks dropped 33%.

FESTIVAL SLACKERS SENT TO HOOSEGOW

<P>
Until Friday, Manh Che had never been behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday morning, a posse of sorts barged into a Carl's Jr. where Che is 
manager and hauled him off. 
</P>
<P>
Che was busted, jailed and forced to pay bail -- all of $1. And all in the name 
of fun and tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not sure what happened," Che, 25, a Laguna Niguel resident, said 
after being released. 
</P>
<P>
Che was an unknowing participant in Hoosegow Day, the day before the Swallows 
Day parade, when anyone in San Juan Capistrano spotted with a cleanshaven face 
or without Western garb can be taken to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Under direction of the Fiesta Assn., the group that puts together the annual 
Fiesta de las Golondrinas, two posses take to the streets in search of 
unsuspecting locals. 
</P>
<P>
One posse is stationed outside the Swallows Inn, using a jail set up alongside 
Camino Capistrano. The other posse roams the streets with a portable jail. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone caught without the appropriate duds or facial hair winds up in jail. A 
button labeled Smooth Puss or a garter, either purchased for $1, will buy 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The bail money will be used to help put on next year's Swallows Day events, 
said Mike Rosenberger, a deputized member of the posse. 
</P>
<P>
After rounding up Che and others in the restaurant's parking lot, the posse 
moved to a nearby Ralphs market and booked about eight employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The store's running on automatic pilot," Ralphs employee Joe Incando of San 
Clemente said from behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosegow Day tradition dates back to when Judge Richard Egan, a county 
sheriff and supervisor who arrived in San Juan Capistrano in 1868, ran the town 
out of his home on Camino Capistrano. The jail, then in his back yard, was the 
original hoosegow and still stands in the Los Rios district of town. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta de las Golondrinas will wrap up today. The Swallows Parade through 
town will start about 11 a.m. LEN HALL

LEGION OF LATIN STUDENTS TO ARRIVE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not quite sure whether or not Mars and Apollo are related? Confused over the 
meaning of veni, vidi, vici? Curious about how to throw the discus while 
wearing a toga? Well, California Latin students will address those issues and 
others this weekend at the annual state Junior Classical League convention in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The students, members of Latin clubs at their schools, will gather at 
University High School in Irvine, the home of the nation's second largest Latin 
club. Student organizers have spent the year preparing for the three-day event 
and say that this week has been the busiest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's chaos, total chaos," said convention co-chairman Aaron Shapiro, one of 
the 236 members of University High's club. "There're about 1,300 students 
coming, and right now it's really hectic." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 49 schools from across the state are scheduled to attend the 
convention, and students traveling long distances will be housed with the 
families of Orange County students. 
</P>
<P>
The convention includes everything from a quiz bowl on mythology to a written 
language and grammar test to team chariot races. 
</P>
<P>
Participants can enter any of the events, as well as help make a team banner or 
scrapbook relating to this year's theme. The theme is based on a quote from 
Virgil's epic poem "Aeneid" and translates: "Perhaps one day it will be 
beneficial to remember these things." 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Shu, a senior at University High and the state's Junior Classical League 
president, said the annual event is a memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
"It really brings the state together," Shu said. "You can see Latin and Roman 
and Greek culture at work." 
</P>
<P>
This is the 35th year for the convention and the second time in the last four 
years that it has been held at University High. This year's keynote speaker 
will be former Los Angeles Rams football player Rosey Greer. LAURA MICHAELIS

EX-O.C. TRAVEL AGENT INDICTED IN FRAUD CASES

A former Orange County travel agent was indicted Friday on charges that he 
defrauded American Express out of about $39,000 in 1986 and soon afterward 
defrauded the airline industry of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Adil Masood, 46, a Pakistani citizen residing legally in the United 
States, is accused of committing eight counts of mail and credit card fraud 
while operating his travel agency, Pega Seas Inc. in Anaheim, said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Jean Gilliland . 
</P>
<P>
Masood is accused of concocting bogus credit charges to transfer $39,000 to his 
merchant account. He allegedly posed as a tour guide booking travel groups, but 
the travelers -- and their credit card numbers -- didn't exist, said Los 
Angeles Police Department Detective Bob Hill. 
</P>
<P>
When American Express officials caught on to his scheme after a few weeks and 
put an end to it, Masood disappeared, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
He resurfaced in late 1986 in San Bernardino where he allegedly defrauded major 
airlines and the Airline Reporting Corp., which oversees ticket sales, of more 
than $1 million, Hill said. Masood allegedly sold discount tickets to customers 
of his Sun Tours 'N Travel but never passed along the fares to the airlines, 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Masood, who is a now a fugitive, faces of 12 counts of mail, wire and credit 
card fraud for his alleged activities in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
His indictment comes after several years of investigation. Masood is the first 
of several people expected to be named as part of a travel industry fraud ring, 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're good. They know the travel industry," Hill said of the ring members. 
"It was very well organized." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Masood could face 110 years in prison and hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in fines and restitution, Gilliland said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Los Angeles Police Department, the Secret Service and the 
San Bernardino police investigated the case.

SCHROEDER ADJUSTS TO TIME ON BENCH; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: CATCHER WOULD PREFER STARTING, BUT HE'S LEARNING TO MAKE THE BEST OF 
ROLE AS LANCE PARRISH'S BACKUP.

If he were younger and his dreams grander, Bill Schroeder might chafe at being 
trapped behind so strong and skilled a catcher as Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
But at 31, Schroeder has accepted that he is destined to play a supporting 
role, not the lead. He merely wants to play it well, and the success of the 
elbow surgery he underwent last September indicates that he could play it 
better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder played 41 games last season before he was forced to have arthroscopic 
surgery, during which team orthopedist Lewis Yocum removed calcium deposits and 
other loose particles from Schroeder's right elbow. His rapid recovery from the 
procedure, which was less serious than the ligament-repair surgery he underwent 
on the same elbow in 1985, has drawn raves from Manager Doug Rader and has 
renewed Schroeder's enthusiasm for his job. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill's swinging the bat better than anyone in camp," said Rader of Schroeder, 
a career .241 hitter who batted only .203 last season. "He's pain-free in his 
throwing, and everything is just perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Friday he is no longer frustrated at playing second-string. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was four years ago, I would have been, but at this point in my career, I 
accept the role of playing behind him," said Schroeder, who began his career 
with the Milwaukee Brewers and was traded to the Angels in December of 1988 for 
infielder Gus Polidor. "I just want to do the best I can at this job and stick 
around as long as I can. Whenever the opportunity presents itself, I want to 
catch well, whether it's once in a while or on an everyday basis if Lance gets 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my seventh year coming up. I'm willing to accept that this is what I'm 
going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Because Schroeder is progressing so well, the Angels probably won't need to 
keep a third catcher on their 27-man roster when they open the season. If they 
decide to keep an extra catcher, it would probably be Ron Tingley, whom they 
acquired from Cleveland last September. Joe Orton, who spent most of last 
season with double-A Midland, Tex., is regarded as a strong prospect who needs 
starting experience at the triple-A level this season. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, who will be 34 in June, caught 124 games last season despite knee and 
rib bruises sustained in an Aug. 5 home-plate collision with the Brewers' Glenn 
Braggs. The after-effects contributed to his late-season batting slump, as he 
hit .176 in August and .219 in September and October, and had only seven RBIs 
in that span. 
</P>
<P>
Well rested after the prolonged winter, Parrish said he feels strong, and he 
doesn't intend to cut his workload this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll catch as many (games) as they want me to, basically," he said. "I don't 
really have any numbers in mind. I just want to stay healthy and do the job." 
</P>
<P>
That may mean Schroeder won't play more games than he did last season, but a 
strong elbow means he can enjoy them more. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling real good at the plate. I worked hard at it and did some of the 
things DJ (Deron Johnson, the Angels' hitting instructor) told me," said 
Schroeder, who has adjusted his grip on the bat and his stance at Johnson's 
urging. "I feel like I'm hitting the ball better to the opposite field and I'm 
getting some power behind the ball to the opposite field. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got cut, I had some doubts about whether this was going to work, 
and I still had some in the first couple of weeks afterward, when it hurt so 
much. But as the winter went on, I realized that my arm is stronger than it 
ever has been." 
</P>
<P>
So is his desire to work with a pitching staff that ranks among the league's 
best. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of fun last year, the pitchers and catchers," Schroeder said. 
"Lance and I brought a lot to the pitchers, and the pitchers brought a lot to 
what we could do. It was a matter of them maturing, and I think (Bert) Blyleven 
had a lot to do with that because of his experience and the atmosphere he 
created in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping everybody improves this season. To do well in our division, we need 
a better performance from everybody, and I think we can get it. When you add 20 
wins from Mark Langston, you know this team is going to be right there."

BLYLEVEN ASKING FOR RENEGOTIATION

Bert Blyleven's agent, Dick Moss, has asked the Angels to renegotiate the 
38-year-old pitcher's contract to extend it beyond this season and pay him at a 
level commensurate with what Moss called Blyleven's "Hall of Fame credentials." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, who was 17-5 last season and the American League's comeback player of 
the year, has 271 major league victories. The Angels exercised their option to 
renew his contract for this season at $1.225 million. His contract also calls 
for several award bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Angel pitchers will earn higher salaries this season: Mark Langston, 
who will earn $1.5 million and already received a $1.5-million signing bonus, 
and Mike Witt, whose salary is $1.310 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been chatting about doing something," Moss said Friday after talking to 
Dan O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice president for baseball operations. "We had 
a very nice preliminary chat. I feel, and most people feel, Bert's one of the 
top pitchers in the game and he's still pitching in his prime. Those 
circumstances make it appropriate to talk about the future." 
</P>
<P>
Moss declined to specify the number of years or dollars he and Blyleven are 
seeking. He also said he is not concerned about working out a deal immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have to do anything, but they recognize that Bert is going to be a 
free agent at the end of the season and they can do something a little more 
favorable," Moss said. "What he's earning now does present an inequity compared 
to the top pitchers in the game." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice president for baseball operations, did not 
rule out renegotiating Blyleven's contract, but said it's not among his top 
priorities. O'Brien spoke in place of General Manager Mike Port, who was ill 
with a stomach virus Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael (Port) and I have discussed it, but there are other major concerns at 
the moment, like getting ready for the season," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, who lives in Villa Park, wants to remain with the Angels but is not 
worried about renegotiating the contract right now. "I'd definitely like it to 
happen if it can be worked out," Blyleven said. 
</P>
<P>
Official word on the rescheduling of the Angels' first six games is due today 
from baseball officials in New York. It's expected that the Angels' three-game 
series at Seattle, originally set for April 3-5, will be made up in three 
visits on what were to be off days. The Angels' first series at Oakland, 
originally scheduled April 6-8, will instead be played Oct. 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
That eliminates the need to schedule doubleheaders late in the season, an idea 
Manager Doug Rader had strongly opposed as being "dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Armas still has not contacted the Angels to confirm that he will report to 
Mesa. However, O'Brien and Manager Doug Rader said they would welcome 
36-year-old outfielder and said Armas could still make the team. 
</P>
<P>
Armas, who hit .257 for the Angels last season in 60 games, was invited to camp 
as a non-roster player. O'Brien's repeated efforts to reach him at his 
off-season home in Venezuela have been fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to his mother two days ago but she didn't speak English, so I 
couldn't find out what was going on," O'Brien said. "He's out there, and we'd 
like to hear from him." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien discounted reports that Armas did not want to show up because he had 
injured his leg playing winter ball. "We're not aware of that being the 
problem," O'Brien said. "I don't think this is a major interruption. He 
probably recognizes that at this stage of his career, it creates more of a 
problem for him than it does for the club. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a point (when Armas' appearance would be too late). But I can't tell 
you when that would be." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he is not ready to write off Armas. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though this is a shortened spring training, that doesn't preclude him 
(from) making the team," Rader said. "He's not here, and we regret it and he 
regrets it, I'm sure. Hopefully, the situation will rectify itself shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Rader announced his pitching plans for the Angels' first four exhibition games, 
which will be played against the Padres in Yuma beginning Monday. Langston will 
start Monday, followed by Witt, Bryan Harvey, Scott Bailes and Bob McClure. 
Kirk McCaskill will start one game Tuesday, followed by Jim Abbott, Willie 
Fraser and Greg Minton. In Tuesday's B game, Mike Fetters, Mike Erb, Jeff 
Richardson and Cliff Young will pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven is set to start Wednesday, followed by Bailes, Mike Smithson, Mark 
Clear and Mark Eichhorn. Thursday's starter will be Chuck Finley, followed by 
Minton, Rich Monteleone, McClure and Harvey.

Clayton Olivier, a two-time Orange County player of the year in 1979 and '80 at 
Los Amigos High School, has been named the school's varsity basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier, who started three seasons at USC, replaces Famous Hooks, who resigned 
this month after compiling a 33-58 record in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos finished 2-19 in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier, 29, coached the school's junior varsity team to a 12-10 record last 
season and was the freshman coach in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"Clayton was a consensus favorite with the kids and had the support of other 
coaches in our athletic department," said Dave Auxier, Los Amigos athletic 
director. "He has a way of dealing with people, and I thought he would put the 
necessary time in to get the program back on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos was among the county's top programs during Olivier's playing days, 
winning Garden Grove League titles during his junior and senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier, a 6-foot-10, 240-pound center, averaged 30.7 points and 12 rebounds as 
a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier helped USC win the Pacific 10 basketball title in 1985. He spent one 
season playing in the Continental Basketball Assn. before bone spurs in his 
left and right ankles ended his professional career. 
</P>
<P>
Auxier said he interviewed 10 candidates. Don Grable, runner-up for the job, 
will become the school's junior varsity coach.

DICEON OF IRVINE PLEADS NO CONTEST IN WASTE DUMPING; FINED $600,000 
</P>

Diceon Electronics Inc. has agreed to settle criminal charges of illegally 
dumping toxic wastes into the Los Angeles sewer system, with the firm pleading 
no contest to three felony charges and the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office agreeing to drop felony charges against the firm's two top 
officers and one former employee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Diceon agreed to pay a $600,000 fine and was placed on 
three years' probation. Charges were dropped against Roland G. Matthews, 
Diceon's president and chief executive. Peter S. Jonas, executive vice 
president, and Richard Thomas, a former director of manufacturing, each pleaded 
no contest to one misdemeanor charge and were placed on one year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
By pleading no contest, a defendant does not admit guilt, though prosecutors 
consider such a plea equivalent to a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Diceon, one of the country's largest independent manufacturers of computer 
circuit boards, was charged in October with 12 felony and misdemeanor counts of 
illegally discharging acid, lead, copper and other toxics from its Chatsworth 
plant into the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was named in all the counts; Jonas and Matthews were each charged with 
one felony and four misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has been in the forefront of a 
national trend toward seeking criminal prosecution of corporate officers in 
pollution cases, a tactic that prosecutors defend as needed to deter 
environmental crime. Defense attorneys say threatening corporate officers with 
prison sentences is simply a way for prosecutors to force companies to settle 
cases that are complicated and expensive to defend. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, a corporate executive can be subject to criminal 
prosecution only if prosecutors prove that they "knew or reasonably should have 
known" that a hazardous-waste violation was being committed. 
</P>
<P>
David Guthman, head of the environmental crime section of Reiner's office, said 
there were "substantial mitigating factors" in the Diceon case that led his 
office to agree to the reduced charges. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the firm's forthrightness in admitting that violations had taken 
place; the good-faith effort Diceon had made to fix problems with its waste 
disposal system before the criminal proceeding, and the company's record as a 
good corporate citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Joel S. Moskowitz, a well-known environmental lawyer who represented Diceon, 
said the company agreed to the settlement "to avoid the time, expense and 
distraction from the business of the company that a lengthy trial would have 
entailed." 
</P>
<P>
Guthman said the $600,000 fine, though substantial, is not the largest ever 
imposed in an environmental case in Los Angeles. The district attorney's office 
receives 25% of the fine to help pay for other environmental cases. 
</P>
<P>
Diceon, which has been in financial straits as a result of a slowdown in the 
electronics business, said at the time the charges were filed that it had taken 
corrective actions at the Chatsworth plant to prevent further discharges and 
that those measures had been approved by the County Department of Public Works. 
The circuit board plant is now operating normally. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, however, said illegal discharges from the 
Chatsworth plant had continued even after a raid on the facility in January, 
1989, by the interagency Hazardous Waste Strike Force. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews and Jonas were charged on the ground that they must have known of the 
problemsafter the raid.

EX-POLITICAL CARTOONIST BENT ON ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean-Pol d. Franqueuil, who was a political cartoonist in France in a previous 
life, asked 6-year-old Rebecca Nguyen of Fountain Valley what she would like 
him to paint on her bedroom walls. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, June, had commissioned a mural that would cover all four walls, and 
Rebecca was calling the shots. 
</P>
<P>
The artist, a Huntington Beach resident whose caricatures of world leaders have 
appeared in the International Herald Tribune, the New York Times, the 
Washington Post and U.S. News and World Report, listened intently as Rebecca 
said: "I want a jungle scene -- and I don't want it to be boring!" 
</P>
<P>
It's not. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca and her year-old brother, Matthew, now awaken each morning in a room 
covered with images of a tiger feeding ice cream to a hippopotamus, monkeys 
swinging from trees and an elephant carrying a balloon. There's also a farm 
scene with a cow sipping a glass of milk, a singing goat and a pig in a pumpkin 
patch. 
</P>
<P>
Franqueuil smiles when asked about his leap from drawing politicians for an 
international audience to painting animals on bedroom walls. 
</P>
<P>
As a cartoonist who worked briefly in Canada and Japan but made his name in 
Paris, he saw the world political scene as "a big theater, a show. And I found 
the same funny things everywhere -- the same kind of politicians trying to get 
to power," he says. What he's doing now, he adds, "is just another kind of 
show" -- one that's bringing him a growing audience in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Murals he's painted in public places -- including the Olga for Kids clothing 
store in Newport Beach and Puccini Ristorante in Santa Ana -- have stimulated 
the demand for his art in private places. 
</P>
<P>
His beach scene at Olga for Kids caught June Nguyen's eye, and she liked the 
one he did for her store, Kidding Time in Westminster, so much that she offered 
him $3,500 to paint her children's room. 
</P>
<P>
Sami Kanawati, owner of Cliche Boutique in Huntington Harbour, commissioned 
Franqueuil to paint abstract floral designs on his shop's walls and ceiling, 
then asked for a piece for his Huntington Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to a favorite theme, Franqueuil painted a beach scene dominated by a 
bold blue sky. But he wasn't satisfied when he placed the painting on 
Kanawati's stark white living room wall. As he studied it, he saw the canvas 
not as a boundary setting limits but as a base on which to build. And he 
impulsively began expanding the scene on the wall itself. 
</P>
<P>
Kanawati is delighted with the results. 
</P>
<P>
"It's both abstract and realistic. When the painting goes onto the wall, it's 
like it's entering the twilight zone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Franqueuil is as spontaneous in life as he is in his art. He came to Southern 
California from Paris three years ago for a two-week vacation -- and never went 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old, self-taught artist -- who was born in Paris but raised in 
Africa where his father's government post exposed him to politics early -- left 
behind a career in which he had begun to feel stifled by his own success. 
</P>
<P>
"Working for newspapers, you always have deadlines," he explains in a 
pronounced French accent. "It takes so much time and energy that you aren't 
open for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a good living; I had a very comfortable life. But I had to leave that 
world. I had a lot of ideas, but I never did anything with them. Sometimes to 
start something, you have to put yourself in danger." 
</P>
<P>
His new freedom in this country took him in unexpected directions. 
</P>
<P>
He designed his own line of contemporary clothing (which never reached the 
market), started a series of celebrity caricatures (Sylvester Stallone, Eddie 
Murphy, Woody Allen) that he hopes to someday publish in a book, and drew 
caricatures of George Bush, Dan Quayle and Mikhail S. Gorbachev for a line of 
watches that will soon be sold through a mail-order business. 
</P>
<P>
He also began painting on large canvases -- works that have a photographic 
realism in spite of his love for Impressionism. He sold two of his oil 
paintings at an exhibit last year at the Beverly Hills Hotel -- one for $5,600, 
the other for $3,500 -- and he plans to make his work more widely available by 
producing lithographs and serigraphs. 
</P>
<P>
While his paintings are pure Jean-Pol, his murals are a reflection of the 
people who commission his work as well as his own style. 
</P>
<P>
In his choice of colors and subjects, he aims for harmony with the tastes and 
personalities of homeowners as well as the furniture and design of a room, he 
says. He recently spent a day getting acquainted with the Newport Beach 
residents for whom he is doing a family portrait and a large mural -- a $10,000 
project. The mural, which will be painted on canvas and stapled to the wall, is 
being custom-made for a child who asked him to include a carousel, her dog and 
her favorite toys. 
</P>
<P>
Franqueuil tries to look at such work through a child's eyes, which is easy for 
a man who admits that one of his main ambitions in life is having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has one life and one must try to spend it in the least painful way 
possible," he muses. "We have to enjoy all the moments, and that's what I try 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
He enjoys his work so much that he sometimes paints through the night, not 
realizing he has forgotten to sleep until he notices his roommate is leaving 
for work. 
</P>
<P>
Fun also means sky diving, wind surfing, sailing, skiing and traveling -- to 
far-off destinations chosen primarily because he likes the sound of their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
His adventurous spirit was not easily put down when he tried to please his 
mother by enrolling in engineering school in Paris before he decided to pursue 
a career as an artist. He lasted only six months. "I was good," he says. "But I 
didn't think it would be a very exciting life." 
</P>
<P>
Franqueuil has found opportunities for excitement -- particularly in his work 
-- so rich in Orange County that he's decided to stay and become a U.S. 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
It did take some adjusting to reach that decision, however. 
</P>
<P>
An open, laid-back man who makes friends easily wherever he is, Franqueuil 
struggled at first with the impression that people here weren't interested in 
having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very involved with their work, more so than in France. There's not 
much time left for doing things spontaneously." 
</P>
<P>
But as his art attracted attention, he attracted new friends, and he learned 
that "people here do have fun, but they plan for it -- three weeks ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he says: "I like the American way of life. I especially like the way your 
talent is recognized here. In France, I'd have to wait until I was dead to be 
recognized. In Europe, you have old habits, old culture and old ways of 
thinking, and you have to struggle against that all the time. It stops your 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new country and everything has to be tried. Whatever your age, the 
attitude is if you can do something, go for it. There's hope that everybody can 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't find the open display of material success in this county 
off-putting, though he's most comfortable in tattered jeans and work shirts, 
with paint on his fingers and his sleeves rolled up. 
</P>
<P>
"People have money, but they've worked for it," he says. "I like the way 
they're proud of what they get and show it. In Europe, if you get very rich, 
you try to hide it from the poor. Here, you don't have to be ashamed of what 
you have." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes his art will bring him enough success so he can someday buy a boat and 
sail around the world. Flying an airplane, his own, is another dream.

TRENDY COVERINGS AREN'T OFF-THE-WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If your image of wallpaper is cute little patterns in nurseries, bathrooms and 
kitchens, it's time to update your thinking. 
</P>
<P>
And probably your walls. 
</P>
<P>
The world of wallpaper has expanded dramatically in recent years, enabling 
interior designers to create looks they call sophisticated, warm, elegant, 
classic -- anything but cute. 
</P>
<P>
And while the range of wallpaper patterns has grown, consumers have discovered 
other ways of dressing up their walls. They're hiring artists to paint 
everything from simple decorations to elaborate scenes. Or covering entire 
rooms with fabrics as sumptuous as silk and suede. Even designer sheets are 
appearing on today's trendiest walls (at prices as high as $110 a yard for the 
popular Ralph Lauren label). 
</P>
<P>
Upholstered walls provide the most luxurious look -- and almost unlimited 
choices, because any fabric can be applied to a wall, says Janet Kay Lang of 
Soussan Interiors in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't find the pattern they want can have the fabric custom-painted, 
she notes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in California wants their own look," Lang says. With so many fabrics 
available for upholstering walls, she can give her clients that individuality. 
But, she adds, "it's for people who want to make a definite statement." 
</P>
<P>
Among her clients is Fred Gamm, a Huntington Harbour entrepreneur who spent 
$125,000 buying fabric and having it installed on nearly every wall of his 
spacious home. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a different look -- something other than wallpaper or paint," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
He also wanted better acoustics to get the most out of his high-tech sound 
system, so he had the ceilings as well as the walls covered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very contemporary, very dramatic," says Lang, noting that upholstered 
walls can also help create a traditional look. 
</P>
<P>
The dominant fabric used throughout Gamm's home is solid peach with an 
abstract, custom-silk-screened black design serving as a border. A soft plaid 
pattern adds a masculine touch to his home office, and a contemporary flowered 
print brightens up the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Although few projects are as costly as Gamm's, upholstered walls are not for 
the budget-conscious, Lang says. Costs range from $20 to $300 a yard for the 
fabric, plus as much as $35 a yard for installation. (Wallpaper installation 
usually costs $15 to $20 a roll, designers say.) 
</P>
<P>
What makes upholstered walls so different -- and tricky to install -- is not 
just the use of fabric instead of paper, but also the polyester padding over 
which the fabric is laid. 
</P>
<P>
The material can be gathered or quilted for a particularly unusual effect. But 
even when it is laid flat, the padding gives it a three-dimensional look. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa interior designer Patricia Mickey explains: "When you upholster a 
wall, it's more cushy. It's looser -- like a big, fluffy sofa as opposed to a 
tailored one." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey chose the tailored look for the Newport Beach condominium she designed 
in "classic, contemporary Mediterranean" style for Lee West, owner of Newport 
Imports. 
</P>
<P>
She used a combination of the latest wallpapers, textured painting and 
paper-backed fabrics, which hug the wall like paper but have a softer, warmer 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Each room in the 4,000-square-foot condo has a different wall treatment, but 
the same fabric appears in the living room and hallways, and muted earth tones 
are used throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"You need some kind of continuity," Mickey explains. "You don't want it to look 
like a furniture store where every room is a different vignette." 
</P>
<P>
The "theme" wall covering is a lightly blushed, beige-colored fabric with a 
subtle brocade design. It even appears on the vertical blinds, so they blend in 
when closed instead of jarring the eye. Other fabrics used in the upstairs 
rooms include ultra suede and silk. 
</P>
<P>
A beige wallpaper with a soft, textured look appears in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"The direction toward texture is a fairly recent trend," Mickey says. 
"Wallpaper used to be more pictorial and one-dimensional. The texture doesn't 
just give you color or pattern -- it provides ambience." 
</P>
<P>
Textured painting was used to create a special effect in the downstairs 
bathroom, where the walls look like ostrich skin. It took 15 coats of paint to 
create the smooth finish on which countless little "goose bumps" were applied 
by hand. (West, who has an ostrich-skin briefcase and shoes, says he finds the 
texture "interesting.") 
</P>
<P>
Textured painting was also used to make the wine cellar look like a cave, and 
Mickey even gave the laundry room special treatment, covering its walls with 
limestone that also dominates an adjacent bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
West said he was thrilled with the results, which not only gave him something 
unusual but also made his long, narrow condo appear more spacious. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a light, airy feeling that makes it seem bigger than it is, and that's 
what I was after," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey calls the overall look of West's home "avant-garde." She acknowledges 
that most people prefer more traditional -- and less costly -- wall coverings. 
</P>
<P>
For them, vinyl wallpaper is the answer, designers say. There are so many 
options in today's market that even some designers find the choices 
overwhelming. Customers who aren't satisfied with what's ready-made can select 
a pattern and plug in their own choice of colors, says Kim Farthing of Farthing 
Interiors in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
She says the recent trend toward textured painting directly on walls is giving 
way to textured papers because they offer a wider range of colors. They start 
at about $30 for a single roll and go up to $60 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Most in demand, she says, are papers with high-gloss, white backgrounds and 
muted patterns or geometric shapes in pastel shades. 
</P>
<P>
"It's soft, sedate, very elegant. It states class," she says. "It makes your 
room look more spacious. You're providing a soft background on which to build. 
And it goes with contemporary and traditional." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone wants wallpaper to serve merely as a background. Some use it 
to make a statement so strong it becomes a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Layman, a Corona del Mar artist who creates wallpaper and fabric patterns 
for Country Life Designs in Costa Mesa, says the traditional Country French 
look is popular in Orange County, particularly in the beach areas, where homes 
tend to be open and airy. 
</P>
<P>
She paints large bouquets of flowers in bright primary colors against a white 
background for her Country Life designs, which are silk-screened on paper or 
fabric by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fresh, bright, country look. And it's very popular," says Layman . 
</P>
<P>
One of her most recent designs is a green lattice pattern on white with a 
border of roses. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks three-dimensional. It's more than wallpaper. You get the feeling of 
being inside a gazebo," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Layman also creates trompe l'oeil illusions in the murals and decorations she 
paints directly on walls. 
</P>
<P>
"Hand painting on walls is very trendy -- and very expensive," she says, noting 
that her $350-per-day fee is marked up 30% to 50% by the designers for whom she 
works. 
</P>
<P>
She receives many requests for faux windows with country scenes that provide 
the illusion of a view in rooms that beg for a feeling of space, she says. 
</P>
<P>
She also is frequently hired to paint decorative borders on walls in floral 
patterns that match bedspreads, upholstered furniture or tiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I paint flowers on everything," she says. "Flowers are so Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Dussault of Wallpapers to Go in Orange agrees. 
</P>
<P>
She says her customers, who buy paper off the shelf for prices as low as $7.99 
for a single roll, are "very traditional -- they like flowers and lots of 
borders." 
</P>
<P>
"They're papering everything -- bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, kitchens," 
says Dussault. "There's so much available today. There's a wonderful selection 
in florals, pastels, muted colors -- whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
Because there are so many patterns, she says, customers are encouraged to take 
rolls of paper home and tack them on the wall to make sure they work before 
making a purchase. They also can take home oversized books filled with 
wallpaper samples. And Dussault, an interior designer, will visit customers' 
homes for a small fee to advise those who need help making a selection. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Mickey stresses that standard, vinyl wallpaper is "definitely not out 
of style," in spite of the availability of more exotic wall coverings. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be used to add interest to a room at a fairly low cost," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want your walls to make a statement, don't be restricted by the idea 
of wallpaper as background, she advises. 
</P>
<P>
It can be much more, Mickey notes -- "a focal point, a jumping-off point for a 
theme."

<P>
People still hang their own wallpaper, but it takes a bit of courage -- and a 
lot of caution -- to do a good job with today's heavier, more expensive vinyl 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Farthing of Farthing Interiors in Newport Beach suggests hiring a 
professional to hang high-quality paper. But, she advises, make sure the firm 
is licensed and has liability insurance -- and check references. 
</P>
<P>
Brendan O'Shea, a paper hanger and owner of B&amp;M Interiors in Fountain 
Valley, says good references are even more important than a license. And, he 
suggests, don't automatically go for the lowest bid. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to pay $15 a roll minimum to get it hung properly," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He said most people can successfully hang the prepasted, lightweight papers 
they buy off the shelf. But with heavier papers, special pastes must be used to 
avoid staining, and matching up seams is tricky, he says. "A lot of people hang 
the first few strips themselves and then call us to straighten it out." 
</P>
<P>
A common mistake, he notes, is hanging the paper too soon after applying the 
paste. "If you hang it too quickly after pasting it bubbles and wrinkles and 
makes a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Ildi Pal, co-owner of Gotcha Covered in Santa Ana, agrees that simpler jobs can 
be handled by the non-professional. But she says many people assume mistakenly 
that kitchens and bathrooms are easy to paper because they're small. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, she explains, "they're the most difficult because there's a 
lot of cutout work. You have to go around cabinets, doors, counters and 
windows, trying to match the pattern. It doesn't look professional because 
people haven't been taught how to do it, and they don't have the right tools." 
</P>
<P>
She says novices often fail to follow instructions for preparing walls and 
therefore have problems getting the paper to stick properly. Many also end up 
with slanted instead of straight lines because they haven't measured carefully, 
she notes. 
</P>
<P>
However, she says, "the average person can follow manufacturer's instructions. 
It's fairly straightforward. Make sure you have a sharp straight edge and a 
clean sponge." 
</P>
<P>
And, Pal advises, choose your paper with care. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick something more durable for the bathroom or kitchen where it gets more 
wear," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"A big mistake people make is when they buy it, they're not thinking of where 
they're going to put it. Is it going to be a background or will it dominate a 
room?" 
</P>
<P>
If they don't consider such factors, it may be too late by the time they 
realize that no matter how well they hang the paper, they aren't going to be 
satisfied with it, she says. SHERRY ANGEL

ON THE WATERFRONT: DON'T GO OVERBOARD IN THE GALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Life.

<P>
Think you've got it tough whipping up a gourmet meal for four in your 
closet-size kitchen? Try trading places with seagoing cooks concocting dinners 
for dozens in smaller-than-closet galleys that sway under foot. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking afloat requires a detailed battle plan, a steady hand and a cast-iron 
stomach, according to Orange County culinary experts who specialize in 
preparing meals on boats. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a considerable difference between cooking on land and on sea," says 
Jacquie Miller, a caterer with six years experience planning yacht parties. "I 
never take on a party on a boat unless I am familiar with the galley first. " 
</P>
<P>
First, Miller checks out the power source for the galley stove. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard boats, many stoves are electric, powered by an on-board generator. "I 
see the galley and find out what kind of generator they have so I know it won't 
blow all the fuses, which sometimes happens on boats," says Miller, who works 
at St. Ives Custom Caterers in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also measures the oven so she can bring pans small enough to fit inside. 
"You've got to make sure that what you are bringing on board is not too big and 
that it is not impossible to prepare it on the boat. Usually you have a very 
small galley. If it is a sailboat, the smaller sailboat -- if it has a range at 
all -- has three burners on top and only two work." 
</P>
<P>
Checking out the galley is also first on the list for Tim McMillan of 
Stonecreek Caterers in Irvine. McMillan, who does all the catering for a 
Newport Beach charter boat company called Adventures at Sea, also warns that 
most normal catering pans will not fit aboard boats. "Generally, larger boats 
will have a normal-size oven, but smaller boats have ovens a lot smaller than 
what you have at home." 
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of overloading the boat's power supply, McMillan says, he 
brings all his coffee aboard in thermoses. "You don't want too many coffee pots 
you have to plug in. You have to remember to work around having limited power." 
</P>
<P>
You also have to make sure that what you bring aboard -- whether it be coffee 
in a thermos or chicken in a pot -- stays where you put it when the boat gets 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Mosher, food and beverage manager for Hornblower Dining Yachts, has seen 
complete table services go flying off tables. "We were going up to Long Beach 
and it was so rough that all the prepared shellfish and prawns spilled out on 
the floor," he recalls. "So we frantically began calling for replacements from 
other locations." 
</P>
<P>
Another Hornblower yacht motored out with the replacement food and saved the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Although many caterers prepare most of their food ahead and then do the 
finishing work on the boat, at Hornblower Dining Yachts all the cooking is done 
on board. "The food is prepared directly on the vessel," says Mosher, who began 
as a prep cook aboard a Hornblower yacht in Berkeley. "We have our own 
commissary and cut up all our vegetables and meat ahead of time, but everything 
else is cooked right on the boat." 
</P>
<P>
Galleys aboard the four yachts in the company's Newport Beach fleet were 
designed for restaurant-style cooking. The largest vessel, which measures 105 
feet, has an industrial galley complete with four-burner stove, three ovens, an 
electric grill, walk-in refrigerator and freezer. 
</P>
<P>
"But the galleys are designed much differently than on land," Mosher says. "You 
have sea rails everywhere (to hold pans in place). And because everything is 
electric, you have to allow for different cooking times. And your sauces have 
to be thicker because of the movement of the boat. Thin sauces would slide off 
the plate. Also, we shy away from soups because of the movement of the boat and 
the danger of spills." 
</P>
<P>
Besides thin sauces and soups, Mosher says his Newport Beach culinary crew, 
which includes eight chefs, an executive chef and a sous chef, can prepare just 
about anything. "We've even done baked Alaska," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge about cooking at sea, according to Mosher, is making sure 
you have brought everything aboard. Other sea-going cooks with less 
sophisticated galleys agree. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bishop, the 18-year-old Eagle Scout who served as cook last summer aboard 
the 68-foot Sea Scout boat Argus, spent a lot of time planning menus and 
shopping for food. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, who cooked 13 meals each week for 26 kids, knew that if he ran out of 
food during one of the Scouts' week-long cruises, he'd probably have a mutiny 
on his hands. "You get pretty hungry when you've out there," says Bishop, who 
spent six to eight hours cooking each day. 
</P>
<P>
"These were not really gourmet meals," he says. "We had a budget. But generally 
the kids liked the food." 
</P>
<P>
Typical meals included French toast, pancakes, or bacon and eggs for breakfast; 
grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch, and spaghetti, tacos, hamburgers or 
barbecued chicken for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop spent a lot of his time cooking while the boat was under way, often on 
rolling seas that would try the patience of any chef. "The weather would make 
it frustrating," he says. "I remember one time I had all the tomatoes and 
onions sliced up for tacos and I put them on the counter. We began rocking 
around and they flew off the counter. We had tacos without tomatoes and 
onions." 
</P>
<P>
Most sea cooks agree that careful planning is the key to a successful meal. 
</P>
<P>
Patsy Campbell, gourmet cook and weekend boater, often prepares meals ahead of 
time and freezes them. "I keep them frozen until I need them and then bring 
them out," says Campbell, author of a cookbook called "From the Heart of 
Patsy's Pantry." 
</P>
<P>
"I have had up to 30 people on our boat and I did all the cooking for the 
party," she said. "Recently I served a brunch for 12 and I put everything 
together at home ahead of time and then cooked it on board. I even baked a 
coffee cake on board." 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant owner Bryon Kough, who has been sailing and cooking for 30 years, 
says he not only plans every meal for every day he expects to be away, he even 
stows the food in the order he expects to use it. "If you are planning to go 
from here to Honolulu, it is important how you stow everything. I put the first 
day stuff on top and so on," says Kough, whose longest passage was a 23-day 
voyage across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being good planners and organizers, ship's cooks also must have 
strong stomachs so the smell of bacon frying does not bring on a bout of 
seasickness. 
</P>
<P>
"During most Sea Scout cruises one or two kids always suffer from seasickness," 
says Bishop, who is not bothered by the malady. "If you do get seasick, really 
the best thing you can do is eat something."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the alligators was dozing in the dirt and the bear was playing with the 
Rottweiler in a nearby cage. 
</P>
<P>
Charles (Cheater) Bella was giving the timber wolves some fresh water while, 
close by, his mountain lions lazed in the morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
Bella, 44, was about to walk past the alligator when he stopped and gave it a 
friendly pat. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch out," he said. "Sometimes she likes to nibble on toes." 
</P>
<P>
These are better days for Bella, now that the trial is over. He is back tending 
to his strange menagerie. Here, at least he knows where he stands. Outside this 
odd compound, surrounded by a stone wall with barbed wire strung atop it, a man 
can have his good name and livelihood stripped away. That's what happened to 
Cheater Bella. 
</P>
<P>
He was just trying to survive. What he got in return was gunfire, handcuffs, an 
indictment, and a mountain of debt. 
</P>
<P>
Amid his snakes, gila monsters, parrots, hawks and other creatures, he ponders 
his fate and one of the crazier tales of justice turned inside out. 
</P>
<P>
It all started with his helicopter, now gathering dust by the front gate. It's 
the reason the fat lady called. 
</P>
<P>
What happened was a prison break, with Bella at the controls of the helicopter 
that swooped into the state prison recreation yard just outside Santa Fe, N. 
M., in July, 1988. From that time on, Bella's already unusual life did a 
back-flip. 
</P>
<P>
As events unfolded, Bella was charged with conspiracy in the escape attempt, 
although he claimed from the beginning that he flew his chopper with a gun 
pointed at his head. 
</P>
<P>
Anger is a tame word to describe Bella in the months that followed. The 
injustice of it all haunted him. Bella's wife, Carrol, would often awaken in 
the night and find him pacing the floor of their tiny living room. Or he would 
rail about how his business had gone bust since the charges were filed, about 
how the notion of innocent until proven guilty was just a load of bear poop. 
</P>
<P>
There came a time when, despite 20 years of marriage, the couple could no 
longer talk about the case. A relationship forged over the years was developing 
cracks. Dark days, they were, terrible days. 
</P>
<P>
And now, even after the sweet moment of victory in the courtroom, things are 
still not as they used to be. His wife is still by his side, but Cheater Bella 
says he is half a million bucks in the hole. The helicopter used on that 
fateful day has not been flown since because the expense of repairing it is too 
great. He is planning on suing the state of New Mexico until, as he puts it, 
"their pants fall off." All because of one lousy telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
Cheater Bella has always lived by a set of rules that aren't quite the same as 
others, and that has made him something of a legend around El Paso, where he 
decided to stay after being discharged from the Army here more than two decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
He always seemed to have the fastest car in town. They started calling him 
"Cheater" at the drag races because he won much more than he lost and the name 
eventually stuck. Even Carrol, who met him while he was pumping gas at a 
service station, calls him Cheater. 
</P>
<P>
He's quick with his fists when he thinks someone has done him wrong. He has a 
temper, and a deserved reputation as one tough guy. He wrestles with a 
600-pound bear for the hell of it. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years he built up his business of making engines run faster and better 
than anyone else's. He became a pilot. He bought one chopper and then another 
and operated Bear Helicopter Service out of his front yard, which is a 
hodgepodge of old tires and cars and motorcycles and engines and sheds. 
</P>
<P>
He flew as a stunt man in several movies, including Rambo III. A framed photo 
of Bella and actor Sylvester Stallone is prominently displayed in the living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The menagerie began with an injured coyote 20 or so years ago. Now Bella 
doesn't even count all the animals inside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife have been licensed by the state and federal government as 
animal rehabilitators. They take wounded and abused and neglected animals and 
nurse them back to health. Every month, it takes 2,000 pounds of dog food, 600 
pounds of chicken scratch and 900 pounds of meat to keep all the animals fed. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps rattlesnakes in the bedroom and a coral snake in the living room. The 
gila monster is on the front porch, along with the parrots. The wounded hawks 
are in cages off to the side, along with the stiff-legged miniature horse. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when a beautiful silver fox being cared for by Bella died, a friend asked 
him if he was going to skin it for the pelt. He looked at the man like he was 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Bella tells the story, the one that a jury later believed, Carrol was 
actually the one who got the first call from the fat lady. The voice on the 
other end said she was a real estate agent in Santa Fe and wanted to rent a 
helicopter to show a potential customer some ranch land. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Bella was just outside Chicago, making a bid on a B-26 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
So he came back early for the job. And before dawn of July 11, 1988, Bella 
lifted off in El Paso and flew due north toward Santa Fe. There, a 250-pound 
woman emerged from the back of a taxicab. She was wearing a flowered shirt and 
carrying a very heavy bag. In the words of Bella, she was "a big ol' ugly 
sloppy 'ol gal.". 
</P>
<P>
And as Bella described it, the woman did something unusual. She asked to sit in 
the back of the French-built Gazelle helicopter instead of the front seat. When 
the chopper was in the air, she kept telling Bella to change his course until 
they were on a direct line with the state prison. When Bella looked around he 
saw a .357 magnum pointed at his head. There were hollow point bullets in the 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"That can do a tremendous amount of damage," Bella said, in a bit of 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
Those next few minutes seemed like years. He told her he needed to drop fuel to 
compensate for the weight of the escapees. But when he landed to do so, she 
never let him get far enough away to make a break for it. When they were 
getting very close to the prison, he grabbed for the gun, but couldn't pull it 
away. She was strong, very strong, and he had injured his hand a few days 
earlier in a fist fight. 
</P>
<P>
They were screaming and cursing at each other. The helicopter was making a 
steep dive and Bella thought that it would begin to fall apart at any second. 
</P>
<P>
"Death was right in front of her and it didn't faze her a bit," Bella said. "It 
was very obvious she was going to do exactly what she was programmed to do." 
</P>
<P>
So he set the helicopter down in the compound at first base of the ball 
diamond. Three men piled in. The woman, who would later be identified as 
Beverly Shoemaker, handed out more guns from her bag. But the chopper would not 
leave the ground and the temperature gauge was red-lined. 
</P>
<P>
"They're screaming at me to go up or they'll blow my head off," Bella said. 
"They were firing at us from the tower and there was just too much weight." 
</P>
<P>
One of the prisoners jumped out of the helicopter and ran next to it until the 
skids left the ground. He hopped back on as the helicopter gained altitude and 
headed toward a fence. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter clipped the top of that fence and barely cleared a taller one. 
One of the prisoners, Randy Lackey, handcuffed Bella to the helicopter. And 
then the chase began. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the next 45 minutes, the skies over northern New Mexico were 
the scene of as wild a ride as any movie. The escapees' plan was to go to a 
small airport, steal a plane and go to Mexico. With a U.S. Customs Service 
Blackhawk helicopter in pursuit, the prisoners ordered Bella down at the small 
airport in Las Lunas, south of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
They all got out, and Bella, who said he was doing as he was told, shut down 
the helicopter engine. The Blackhawk landed and Bella started thinking the 
adventure was over, that he would be heading home in half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
But to his disbelief, one of the prisoners, Francis Mitchell, began walking 
back towards him, right in front of the Blackhawk and the Customs Service 
officer armed with an assault rifle. He hopped in Bella's helicopter and told 
him to get it off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
When the Blackhawk's pilot saw Bella's rotors begin to turn, he lifted off and 
hovered over the other helicopter, trying to keep it on the ground with the 
downward wash of air. Flying rocks battered the windshield. As Bella's 
helicopter lifted off, he pulled off a remarkable piece of piloting by scooting 
his craft out from under the Blackhawk with only a foot or so to spare between 
the two choppers. According to news accounts printed at the time, Mitchell was 
holding a gun to Bella's head. 
</P>
<P>
A Customs agent began firing at Bella's helicopter. It was about then, as the 
two choppers were racing north toward Albuquerque, that Mitchell realized the 
game was up. Bella set the Gazelle down at the Albuquerque airport and Mitchell 
gave himself up. 
</P>
<P>
Then the police did something Bella did not expect. They put handcuffs on him, 
even though he was still bound by the ones Lackey had put on him during the 
prison break. 
</P>
<P>
That temper of Bella's went through the roof. He had been shot at. They had 
allowed Mitchell back in the helicopter and they were still putting the cuffs 
on him. Hours later, when Carrol received the first call from her husband, she 
had to hold the phone away from her ear. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who had stationed themselves in her living room took notes as Bella 
questioned the collective IQ of the New Mexico law enforcement authorities. One 
of Bella's lawyers speculated recently that the hot temper might have been the 
source of the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he held back his feelings about how stupid they were," attorney 
David Norvell said. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, who was quickly apprehended in Las Lunas, told authorities Bella had 
nothing to do with the prison break, which she pulled out of love for one of 
the inmates, Danny Mahoney. Her lawyer said the same thing. But reports started 
coming out of "inconsistencies" in Bella's story. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who was serving time for murder, told arresting officers that Bella 
was in on the deal. And Lackey, as part of a plea bargain agreement, would 
later testify against Bella. 
</P>
<P>
On Bella's second day in custody, he was charged with conspiracy and three 
counts of aiding and abetting an escape. 
</P>
<P>
Bella's somewhat simplistic view of life has always gone something like this: 
If you do right, you're fine. If you do wrong, you get nailed. He said it was 
not until months after he posted bond that he realized that perhaps his case 
was not so open and shut as he saw it. 
</P>
<P>
He figured he had better find himself some legal firepower, preferably someone 
who knew a lot about helicopters, someone who would understand that he would 
not have taken the Gazelle in for the kind of load he would carry out of that 
prison yard. Bella picked up the phone and called Palm Beach, Fla. The voice on 
the other end was that of helicopter pilot and famed criminal lawyer F. Lee 
Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
The trial lasted 10 days. Dist. Atty. Chet Walter contends to this day that 
Bella would have been convicted had not Mitchell's statement after his arrest 
been thrown out as hearsay. 
</P>
<P>
But when the case went to the jury, Bailey was so sure of the verdict he left 
to catch a plane to Dallas. After less than three hours of deliberation, Bella 
was found innocent on all counts. Then the jurors made a somewhat unusual 
request. They asked if Bella would accompany them to the steps of the 
courthouse for a group photo. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been practicing law for 32 years and I've won a lot and lost a lot," said 
attorney Norvell, "But I've never seen a jury invite a defendant to go outside 
and have their picture taken with him." 
</P>
<P>
When he left Santa Fe after the trial, Bella did a fly-by of the prison where 
his troubles all began. 
</P>
<P>
Bella is back in El Paso with his animals and the strains between him and 
Carrol are gone. It has been more than six months since the jury found him 
innocent, but he is still picking up the pieces, trying to get his debts taken 
care of. It's been rough. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been mauled by lions, and bit by alligators, but those crises seem 
insignificant now. I've found that one of the most difficult things in life is 
to prove your innocence," he said.
