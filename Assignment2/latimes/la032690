PART-TIME COLLEGE WORKERS FEEL EXPLOITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Julia Fye, plain speaking and not shy about voicing an opinion, said she has 
seen working people "wronged too often" to remain quiet while she and other 
part-time employees of the San Diego Community College District are 
"exploited." 
</P>
<P>
Fye, 63 and a widow, and her sister, Ann Hamilton, 57, work occasionally as 
janitors for the district. The two feisty sisters and 148 other part-time 
hourly workers are at the center of a labor dispute that has pitted the 
district and its three campuses against the Service Employees International 
Union, Local 102. 
</P>
<P>
Some part-time employees work up to 194 days a year, with no benefits, paid 
vacations or paid holidays. Others work only a few days each month. Although 
most have worked part time for several years, they keep getting bypassed for 
permanent jobs that become available to less-qualified applicants, the union 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
Each worker interviewed for this story said he or she has endured the 
uncertainties that come with the marginal jobs in the hopes of landing a 
permanent job with the district and the full range of benefits that come with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"If I work for a place a certain length of time, that should tell them I'm good 
enough to work for them," said Fye, who has been a part-time employee for two 
years. "Custodians don't even count to the district. They figure you're dirt, 
and they'll get rid of you along with the dirt you pick up. A person's got 
pride. . . . When you get passed up again and again it's a slap in the damn 
face. It breaks you up." 
</P>
<P>
According to the district's director of personnel, Wayne Murphy, the district 
employs 150 hourly, part-time workers, in addition to its permanent labor 
force. The workers, who are called a "contingent work force" by the union, are 
represented by Local 102, and, theoretically, are used by the district to 
replace full-time employees who are ill, injured or on vacation. Most of the 
part-timers are custodians, but the group also includes gardeners and 
secretaries, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The part-timers do the same jobs performed by the district's permanent 
employees, but at half the pay. State law allows college districts to hire 
replacements from a pool of part-time workers without paying them benefits as 
long as they don't work more than 194 days during the fiscal year that begins 
July 1, said Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Although some workers like Fye and Hamilton are now working about five days a 
month, others are in effect full-time employees who do the same jobs as 
permanent employees for more than six months of the year, but at a cheaper 
cost, said Local 102 organizer Kim Waldron. 
</P>
<P>
"The district doesn't want to admit it, but they're a cheap labor pool. It's a 
great deal for the district; not having to pay benefits or higher wages, but 
the work still gets done," said Waldron. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Lord, yes. It's exploitation," added Fye, who earns $6.33 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he is troubled by charges that the district is exploiting part-time 
workers, most of whom are minorities and women. Budgetary restrictions force 
the district to rely on a system that everyone agrees is flawed, Murphy added. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the only time they are employed is when someone is away from the 
job. Some people who have been around for a while, learn the job, and are 
frequently called to substitute and do put in 194 days. . . . But the district 
cannot magically produce money to hire these people full time," said Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Waldron and the union have asked the district to fill permanent jobs from the 
pool of temporary workers. Murphy dismissed the suggestion as a call for "a 
back-door contract" and said the district prefers having applicants compete for 
available jobs. Recently, the district hired 11 custodians, eight of whom came 
from the ranks of temporary workers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The district doesn't want people brought in without competition. . . . We told 
the union that back-door contracts aren't in the public interest. Potentially, 
neighbors, relatives and friends could be brought in as part-timers to make 
them eligible for full-time positions," said Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants, including those for gardening and janitorial positions, are 
screened by an interview board that includes management representatives. Some 
workers say the process is too intimidating and not always fair. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalio Fuentes, 48, has worked for the district as a part-time gardener for 
more than four years. By all accounts, Fuentes is an exceptional worker who 
requires little supervision, but has been unsuccessful at landing a full-time 
job with the district. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have notified him that he will be laid off, again, at the 
beginning of April, said Fuentes, lest he work more than 194 days and have to 
be paid benefits. Previous layoffs have lasted from one week to a couple of 
months, said Fuentes, who earns $6.02 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm being exploited. If I was not a good worker, they would never 
call me back time after time," said Fuentes. "I've been passed over for at 
least six jobs over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes was interviewed for a permanent job last year, but he "didn't do well," 
said Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Koppel, who is Fuentes' co-worker, charged that Fuentes failed the oral 
interview because of a "Catch-22 situation" imposed by the district. 
</P>
<P>
"They told him to take a translator because he doesn't speak English very well. 
He did as he was told, then they told him they couldn't hire him because he 
needed a translator to communicate with people," said Koppel. "That's nonsense. 
Rosalio may not speak English very well, but he succeeds in communicating with 
you." Koppel, a permanent employee who earns more than $12 an hour, said he 
"feels guilty as hell because Rosalio should have gotten my job." Koppel was 
hired off the street three years ago, while Fuentes was working part time. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time that a position became open, everyone thought it would be given 
to him. . . . He deserved my job because he's better than me," said Koppel "The 
guy's a saint. . . . I've seen him come to work when he's sick, because he has 
no sick leave. There's no better gardener than Rosalio, and the district treats 
him like dirt. It infuriates the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
The district now has an opening for a gardener, and six more gardening 
positions are expected to open up soon. Fuentes is eyeing the positions and 
hopes "that this time my time will come." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy offered Fuentes a little encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"Some, like Fuentes, are hired repeatedly, long-term and are considered 
employees," said Murphy. "Ultimately, I'm sure he will be hired full-term. I'm 
surprised that he hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's promise comes a bit late for Fuentes' family. Because of his frequent 
layoffs, Fuentes' two daughters, ages 19 and 18, were forced to drop out of 
high school and find jobs to help the family. The two young women are now 
working in a laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Other workers charged that they are given job titles that do not coincide with 
the work they perform in order that the district can keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
Stephan Boyle, 37, has worked as a part-time employee since 1980 and is 
classified as a tool room attendant for the automotive, welding and machine 
shops at San Diego City College. Boyle and the union said he is actually used 
as an instructional assistant and lab technician. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my job, but I don't like the wages," said Boyle, who earns $6.23 per 
hour. "I do supply all the special tools and audio visual equipment to the 
students, but I spend a lot of my time instructing them." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle also supervises five student employees, but "I get absolutely nothing 
from this." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here since 1980, but I haven't accumulated any seniority. I'm 
considered a nobody. . . . I'd really like to be permanent. It's only fair. 
When they do, I should get something for the time I've been here. Maybe not 
back pay, but at the very least some recognition," said Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, although not admitting that Boyle is working outside his 
classification, said he sympathizes with him. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation is very unfair to people," Murphy said. "But the idea of giving 
somebody an advantage over others because he's already on the job is not in the 
public interest. But we also don't like having somebody year after year feeling 
exploited, without being put in a permanent position. We're trying to find a 
solution."

SUSPECT IN DEATH OF BOY WAS FIRED BY PTA CENTERS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING A NORTHRIDGE BOY FAILED TO HEED WARNINGS ABOUT 
INAPPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
A former child-care worker, jailed in the slaying of an 8-year-old Northridge 
boy whose body was burned beyond recognition, had been fired in the last three 
months from two PTA-run day-care centers for failing to heed warnings by 
supervisors to stop punishing children so harshly, PTA officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Scott Smith, 21, who is being held at Ventura County Jail for 
investigation of the slaying of Paul Bailly, also was fired from part-time jobs 
at two San Fernando Valley elementary schools after supervisors complained that 
he argued with them and would not obey orders, PTA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's supervisors complained that he would "ridicule and make fun of children 
in a way hurtful to their self-esteem," said Cecelia Mansfield, president of 
the 31st District Parent Teacher Student Assn., which operates day-care 
programs at 17 elementary schools for 800 children in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent job Smith lost was at Darby Avenue Elementary School in 
Northridge, the school the Bailly boy attended and from which he disappeared 
Friday morning after being dropped off by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city school district officials said Sunday that the boy's death 
will prompt a review of the security measures employed by the San Fernando 
Valley PTA's child-care program, which earlier this year received national 
recognition as an outstanding volunteer agency. But after an emergency meeting 
Sunday, PTA officials said the program was not to blame for the child's death. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say Bailly disappeared shortly after being dropped off by his 
mother about 7 a.m. Friday at the Darby Avenue School's PTA-run child-care 
center. The boy's gagged and burned body was found in a field south of Simi 
Valley about noon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was arrested early Saturday near his Canoga Park home after attempting to 
flee from police. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Joseph Harwell said authorities are working to put 
a case together against Smith for presentation to the district attorney's 
office, probably on Tuesday. He said investigators are planning to show Smith's 
photo to potential witnesses today. 
</P>
<P>
But Harwell said they have been unable to find a witness who could put Smith at 
the place where the boy was dropped off Friday morning for school. "That's one 
area we're pursuing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hammond, an attorney for Smith, said Sunday that his client is "innocent. 
They've picked up a suspect and now they're trying to make a motive. I've seen 
no evidence connecting him to the crime." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, an athletic-looking man who frequently showed up to work in shorts and 
carrying a school bag, had worked mornings at the Darby school since September, 
1988. He had completed a yearlong child-care vocational course at Chatsworth 
High School, said Harold Kuhn, executive director of the PTA's Project Latchkey 
child-care program. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was fired in March from Darby school, less than a month after the PTA 
hired a new child-care director there, Kuhn said. Smith had also been fired in 
December from a similar program at the Chatsworth Park School after complaints 
by the director there, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said Smith's supervisors complained that Smith would punish children for 
misbehaving by forcing them to sit on benches for much longer than appropriate. 
Kuhn also said supervisors reported that Smith made fun of children by, for 
example, asking them: "Where did you get those clothes? The Goodwill?" 
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel Wright, a Northridge parent of a boy in the Darby child-care program, 
said his son, Chris, 9, complained that Smith was "aggressive and 
short-tempered" in games with the children. Wright joined other parents who had 
complained to Smith's superiors about his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Wright added that his child told him, "There was a game where they all chased 
Paul (Bailly). Paul, I guess, was 'it' all the time." 
</P>
<P>
After his firing from the Chatsworth Park School, Smith was warned that he 
could also lose his job at Darby if he did not change his attitude, said Kuhn, 
a retired elementary school principal. "He seemed to accept it and said he 
would do better." 
</P>
<P>
But Kuhn began receiving similar complaints from the new Darby school 
child-care director, Candy Bekins, in February. Kuhn fired Smith March 6 at a 
meeting where Smith became very angry, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
"I warned him about making threats to anybody and he said, 'If I'm angry at 
anyone I would take it out on you,' " Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Smith showed up for work briefly and later cursed a PTA 
supervisor over the telephone, Kuhn said. As a result, Kuhn said, he warned 
school officials to watch out for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he saw Smith on school grounds several afternoons last week. 
</P>
<P>
No one answered the front door Sunday at Smith's Gazette Avenue home, where he 
lived with his mother and grandmother in a quiet, middle-class neighborhood of 
large, well-tended homes. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, no one responded at the Reseda Boulevard apartment where Paul lived 
with his mother, Mary Bailly. 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting Sunday with PTA child-care supervisors, Kuhn said parents will 
be reminded that they must accompany their children to and from the doors of 
the child-care classrooms. He also defended the program's security. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything wrong with the procedures as long as they are followed," 
Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents at Darby were issued notices earlier this year reminding them that they 
must accompany their children to the child-care room, PTA officials said. But 
some parents don't follow the requirement because they are often pressed for 
time in the morning, officials said. PTA officials said Paul was not signed in 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley school board member Julie Korenstein said Sunday that she will be 
asking district officials to examine the procedures for background checks 
required of child-care workers using school district property. 
</P>
<P>
Smith applied for the PTA job during the summer of 1988, using a letter of 
recommendation written by the Chatsworth High School instructor of the school's 
"Careers with Children" course, Kuhn said. In the April 25, 1988, letter, Smith 
is described as "friendly, kind and firm with nursery school children," based 
on his work at the high school's child-care center, which is not affiliated 
with the PTA. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had also received a commendation from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for volunteer work with children at the Nevada Avenue School in Canoga 
Park while Smith was still attending high school, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's application for work as a child-care teacher's assistant was approved 
by the state Department of Social Services, which grants licenses to operate 
child-care facilities and conducts criminal record checks on prospective 
child-care workers, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
The 31st District PTA was recently named as one of 13 exemplary volunteer 
programs nationwide by the National Research Council for its child-care 
program, as well as for providing health and dental care to needy students. 
</P>
<P>
The PTA's 7-year-old Latchkey Project currently charges from $8 to $45 a week 
for its before- and after-school care, depending on the parents' income. 
Classrooms are leased to the PTA by the city school district for a token fee. 
</P>
<P>
The Darby school currently has 97 students enrolled in the child-care program, 
making it the largest child-care site operated by the PTA, officials said.

BOCCIE -- RETIREES' OLD BALLGAME; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITIONS: TWELVE COUPLES BUILT A BOCCIE BALL COURT NEAR THEIR OXNARD SHORES 
APARTMENTS YEARS AGO. IT'S STILL IN USE, DESPITE THE PLAYERS' INCREASING HEALTH 
PROBLEMS.

<P>
Twenty-eight years ago, when rabbits still roamed vacant oceanfront lots, Frank 
and Eva Crosetti and three other couples came to Oxnard Shores in search of a 
place to retire. 
</P>
<P>
They hoped to share sea breezes and one another's company as they grew old. 
Before long, the four couples had grown to 12. All were Italian-Americans from 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
They built 12 apartments in a U-shape on two lots and called it Villa Anacapa. 
On the vacant lot next door, they built a boccie (also spelled bocce) ball 
court. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that they would play the ancient Roman game they had learned as 
youngsters. They would roll large wooden balls on a long gravel court, scoring 
points for their skill at knocking opponents' balls away from a tiny ballino 
while staying close to it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The players would gamble a little and argue a lot. They'd sip wine and 
celebrate the day. Over the years, they became an institution in Oxnard Shores. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was young then. They'd drink and have tournaments. Now they're too 
old to drink," says Rosalie Emanuel, who with her husband, James, owns one of 
the units. 
</P>
<P>
But even today, when the weather is good and spirits are high, the men, ranging 
in age from 66 to 85, still play. 
</P>
<P>
"They are rowdy," says young neighbor Jeff Fried, who often joins the game. 
</P>
<P>
Marianne Romo, who lives across Driftwood Street from the court, says: "We can 
hear them out there even with our windows closed. They bet and they argue. I 
think it's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
One recent day six old bowlers were on the court, leaning low to flip green or 
brown boccie balls off their finger tips. Their target was the small ball 90 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
One bowler rolls short of the mark. Nick Bucci, 83, known for his extraordinary 
stroke but sidelined with a heart attack, grunts in disgust: "Come on you guys. 
Don't you know the game?" 
</P>
<P>
Domenico Pesce, or Dominic Fish, 83, responds with a roll that is true: "Come 
in there, come in there. Yeah. Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Then Pesce, who is wearing his official boccie team shirt, apologizes for his 
lack of intensity. If Charlie Dragna and Joe Maestro were here, he says, then 
"it would be a good game. They do bet on the side." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a wife will join in too, the men say. But, as 77-year-old Frank 
Crosetti whispers when his big sister, Lina Del George, is out of earshot: 
"It's a man's game. It's only recently that we let the ladies play." 
</P>
<P>
The men and Del George bowl for less than an hour. The day is gray and 
overcast. They promise that they will be back when it is warmer. 
</P>
<P>
But these days such promises carry less certainty than they once did. 
</P>
<P>
Health problems increase. Builders want to buy the boccie lot. And some of the 
owners are thinking about selling. It cost them $12,500. Now it's worth 
$400,000, says an area real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll sell it one day," Frank Crosetti says. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, adds his sister, Del George: "We have to keep it for the sake of 
the men. It's something for them to do."

THE HIDEAWAY WHERE HEROIN ADDICTS LURK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A spring breeze rustles branches and palm leaves, and carries the voices of two 
homeless men who live and sleep near 10th and Ash avenues, just off California 
163. The breeze also carries the smell of human feces, the songs of birds and 
the whoosh of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
In the shrubbery are pieces of people's lives: a black-and-white picture of a 
child with a pacifier in his mouth. The writing on the back reads: "Linton, 
January 1975, 7 months old." 
</P>
<P>
Another picture, this one of a young woman, was dedicated on Jan. 5 to "Candice 
. . . You've been a great friend." A water-soaked mattress, a brown leather 
shoe and yellow and blue blankets lie at the bottom of a drainage ditch. 
</P>
<P>
The area also holds ample evidence of drug activity. Amid the dry leaves and 
dead branches are hundreds of red, yellow, green, orange and blue balloons in 
which heroin is sold. There also are bottles and cups filled with water to 
liquefy the substance, soda bottle caps and spoons to heat it up, and syringes 
for injecting it. 
</P>
<P>
For people intent on shooting heroin, the California 163 right of way at 10th 
and Ash provides the perfect cover. Users can usually see the police before the 
officers can see them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safe here," said Carlos Lopez, who often goes to the area to shoot up. 
"If I see (police), I throw the stuff away. I don't run," he said. "Even if I 
run, they are going to catch me." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez arrived in San Diego about 18 months ago and began using the deadly drug 
about six months later. A slow-talking, lanky 21-year-old, Lopez said he has 
been trying to kick the habit and has managed to reduce his heroin intake by 
about half. The area is one of many that he frequents downtown. During his year 
of drug use, Lopez said, he has been arrested only once. 
</P>
<P>
He is just one of many who can be found at 10th and Ash. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal activity goes on day and night, including areas behind the downtown 
Travelodge, at 10th and Ash, and Denny's, at 9th and Ash. Managers of both 
businesses said they have worked with the police and Caltrans to minimize the 
traffic of users who trudge through the greenery. 
</P>
<P>
Both said that the drug traffic seems to have diminished recently. 
</P>
<P>
But, within minutes of entering the area Wednesday, two officers walking the 
downtown beat caught a man just as he finished injecting himself with the drug. 
The officers' tan uniforms and quiet steps camouflaged them. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, Tom Boerum and Elliott Stiasny, were standing across a drainage 
ditch when the man looked up. He tried to run but sat down after Stiasny 
ordered him to stop. When Stiasny reached him, a needle, spoon and water-filled 
beer bottle were at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a safe place," sighed the 39-year-old man, as he waited in a 
police car for his arrest to be processed. 
</P>
<P>
Before Stiasny joined the foot patrol, the area was part of his rounds in a 
police car. Because the right of way is part of a busy beat, including the 
southern portion of Balboa Park and downtown, police officers can't concentrate 
manpower on just that area, said Lt. Jim Barker of the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just one of many locations throughout the city" where people shoot 
drugs, Barker said. "Officers go through the area as often as they can." But 
the frequency of forays is reduced by other, higher priority calls. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron Seeden said, "Someone shooting up under a tree is a lower priority than 
someone calling up and saying, 'A guy just put a gun to my head and stole money 
out of the cash register.' " 
</P>
<P>
In July 1987, a fire along the right of way prompted Caltrans to trim brush and 
remove dead fronds from palm trees. But there are still many places to hide, 
said Jim Larson, a spokesman for Caltrans. "It's not a pretty thing. . . . 
(And) not very safe to have people so near the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance crews, he said, clean the area every two or three weeks and always 
find the remains of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Gasca, who became manager of the downtown Travelodge in September 1988, 
said that, when she started, drug users and homeless people often camped behind 
the motel or hung out in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing," she said, "to tell guests, 'Don't leave anything in your 
car that you don't want to lose.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some motel guests were drug users themselves, she said, leaving bloody towels 
and syringes in the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Gasca has tried a number of things to upgrade the area, including complaints to 
the police and floodlights around the motel. She also discreetly checks 
would-be guests for tell-tale signs of heroin use, including lethargy and sores 
on the hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
The police have responded by coming around more often, and the floodlights 
discourage people from hanging around for too long, she said. But deciding whom 
to admit is not easy. "It could be just someone who needs a room," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The measures have helped, Gasca said. "Last weekend all the rooms were full." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the drug activity persists. The whitewashed rear walls of the motel 
were recently spray-painted with the words "Evil Tweak," a slang term for 
heroin users. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, according to preliminary figures of the San Diego County coroner's 
office, 100 people died of heroin-related overdoses in the county, more than 
twice the number that died of cocaine and methamphetamine overdoses combined.

<P>
Two men have been charged with attempted murder in a gang-related shooting in 
December, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A dispute between two rival Filipino gangs led to the drive-by shooting at 3813 
Merrill Court the night of Dec. 23, said Simi Valley Police Sgt. Arch Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
The bullets narrowly missed three residents inside the house. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Clint Gellekanao, 22, of Pico Rivera and Franley Jardeleza, 27, 
of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Handguns were seized in both homes, including a 9-millimeter handgun believed 
to be related to the shooting, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were booked Wednesday on charges of attempted murder and shooting at 
an occupied dwelling, Morgan said. CAROL WATSON

Ventura County's five lawmakers say they strive to put aside personal and party 
differences when decisions are being made to split up state funds for local 
public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn M. Suter, a capital lobbyist for the city of Ventura, agrees that the 
"vast philosophical differences" among the county's three Republican and two 
Democratic lawmakers "don't get in the way of the delegation responding to 
local needs." 
</P>
<P>
She cited a successful bipartisan effort in the past two years to pry loose a 
$3.5-million package to rebuild the Ventura Pier -- severely damaged by storms 
in 1986 -- over the objections of Gov. George Deukmejian's Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The pier funding would never have worked" unless the delegation had banded 
together, Suter said. The delegation includes Sens. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) and 
Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Assembly members Tom McClintock (R-Thousand 
Oaks), Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) and Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
Hart, the area's senior lawmaker, who played a major role in the pier funding, 
acknowledged "one thing that can work to a county's benefit is having people 
from both parties" champion local issues. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock agreed, noting that he lobbied Deukmejian to support the pier 
funding. "The Republicans can intervene with the governor and the Democrats" in 
both houses of the Democrat-controlled Legislature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart also cited cooperation among lawmakers to obtain state transportation 
funds for projects such as the completion of the interchange of the Simi Valley 
and Moorpark freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the efforts have revolved around construction projects. Suter has 
organized delegation members to urge support for a $59,000 grant from the state 
Department of Conservation to expand Ventura's residential recycling program. 
Under the proposal, about 100 recycling containers would be placed at apartment 
buildings, mobile home parks and condominium complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Supervisor Susan Lacey agreed that the lawmakers "seem to work 
well" when local projects are at stake. But, she said, McClintock "has a 
tendency to be less part of it" than the others. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock has been embroiled in an ongoing public feud with the Board of 
Supervisors, especially Supervisor Madge Schaefer, over the county's need for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very liberal board, I'm a conservative legislator, and there's bound to 
be friction on welfare spending, tax increases" and other issues, McClintock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Schaefer complained that McClintock "doesn't have a clue as to what is 
happening in the county."

PARENTS RAISING MONEY TO STOCK SCHOOLS WITH QUAKE SUPPLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caught between a money-short school district and fears for their children's 
lives, San Fernando Valley parents have been forced to pay for bandages, water 
and other earthquake survival supplies in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought -- living in the state of California where there are earthquakes -- 
that our schools would be protected," said parent Candy Stanman, chairwoman of 
the earthquake preparedness committee at Millikan Junior High in Sherman Oaks. 
"I'm very angry about the whole situation. I think the schools are responsible. 
That's their job, to protect the children and the schools." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District expects parents to share the cost of 
preparedness, but PTA leaders face a host of problems in giving students the 
best chance of surviving an earthquake: parent apathy, district rules and a 
lack of action by administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan recently raised about $1,000 for survival supplies from a spaghetti 
dinner. Other schools have been selling cupcakes, holding book fairs, redeeming 
recyclable cans and asking for help from local businesses to outfit each 
classroom with survival goods. 
</P>
<P>
Parents want thermal blankets, food, water, flashlights, hard hats, stretchers 
and crowbars to prepare for a quake that scientists say could devastate the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The school district considers those items essential, but the profusion of 
educational programs competing for funding has dampened parents' hopes for 
disaster preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kurilich, director of the school district's emergency services office, 
said it was unrealistic to expect a district facing a $200-million deficit to 
fund supplies single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what we have to do but we don't have the money to do it," he said. 
"The district looks at this as a joint school and parent effort." 
</P>
<P>
But some parents say that if the district rated preparedness a high priority, 
it would find the funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says, 'Gee, this is important but we don't have the money for it.' 
It's quite sad because it's little children that are going to be victims," said 
Rheva Nickols, PTA safety chairwoman at Kester Avenue Elementary School. At the 
school, $2,000 trickled in over three years to buy 10 55-gallon water barrels 
and other emergency supplies for each classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor funding, some headway has been made. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has equipped each of its 600-plus schools with two 
hand-held radios and first aid kits with enough supplies to care for 100 
injured people for three days. In the last five years, the district has trained 
4,000 school personnel in first aid, held search-and-rescue classes and created 
school drill plans that are mandated by law. 
</P>
<P>
The district has been considering training its 57,000 employees on rescue 
techniques and assigning priorities for medical treatment. And it may revoke a 
rule requiring district approval before schools can hold fund-raisers, take in 
money and accept supplies donated for earthquake preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley's 31st PTA District, which used to prohibit its chapters from 
spending more than $250 a year for earthquake preparedness because unlimited 
spending was considered unfair to schools that didn't have similar resources, 
now advises its 153 Valley schools to work on preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Dixon-Davis, disaster preparedness chairwoman for the 31st District, said 
she plans to ask the district to create guidelines on preparedness, fund a 
permanent emergency services coordinator and provide basic supplies, such as 
water, for all schools. 
</P>
<P>
Since she raised funds for supplies for her children's school seven years ago, 
Dixon-Davis has seen the number of PTAs doing the same thing double. She said 
about 30 schools supplement what the district gave them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting scared. Look at all the earthquakes" that have occurred around 
us, Dixon-Davis said. But she fears the district may tell PTAs: "You do it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Other school districts also expect parents to chip in for supplies, but some 
have bought equipment and cargo-type containers to hold it, along with adhesive 
window film that would stop breaking glass from falling into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
PTA leaders said poor parent participation has hampered their efforts, leaving 
them feeling isolated in their mission. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized right off the bat when we tried to get donations from parents for 
the buckets that it was going to be a long haul," Nickols said. "They want 
something done for earthquake preparation for their schools, but they don't 
want to put a lot of effort into it. It's fear, too. They don't want to think 
about it. " 
</P>
<P>
Nickols was one of five parents with children at Kester who asked the board of 
education in 1988 to decrease the number of non-structural hazards, such as 
windows, that could shatter during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The district will not allow windows to be coated with a polyester retention 
film, even if parents raise the money to pay for it. In past earthquakes, glass 
from school windows has flown across classrooms. No one was injured because the 
quakes occurred while school was not in session. 
</P>
<P>
Kurilich said the district would be liable if parents bought the coating and 
were injured while applying it to the windows. But he said he also recognized 
that the district might be responsible for injuries that result from broken 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
Parents aren't waiting for the district to change its rules. Stanman, 
struggling to gather $2,000 more for supplies, may have to raise money again 
when her 13-year-old son moves on to high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that the school will be really equipped to my satisfaction by the 
time my child graduates," Stanman said. "We'll have a lot more expenses if our 
children are injured and if parents decide to sue the school system for not 
taking action."

TRIAL IN 1983 MURDER FOCUSES ON GUARD DOG'S TRUST OF KILLER; 
</P>
<P>
MYSTERY: WHY DIDN'T DANTE THE GERMAN SHEPHERD ATTACK WHOEVER SHOT HIS MASTER? 
WAS THE DOG LYING DOWN ON THE JOB OR DID HE KNOW THE GUNMAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A German shepherd guard dog named Dante did nothing to stop an intruder who six 
years ago shot and killed the man the dog had been trained to protect, but what 
would appear to be a case of canine cowardice has instead become a key piece of 
evidence in the trial of the alleged killer. 
</P>
<P>
Noel P. Scott, 28, is on trial for the Oct. 16, 1983, murder of his 
grandfather, 70-year-old Louis Fox, partly because he was one of only a handful 
of people who could have slipped into the victim's North Hollywood house 
without being attacked by Dante, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege that Scott, a struggling actor and musician, shot his 
grandfather three times in the head with a .30-caliber handgun after a heated 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
"Noel Scott was possibly closest to the dog next to Lou," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Sidney D. Trapp Jr., the prosecutor in the case. "The grandson was so 
close to the dog that the dog would jump into the pool when Noel swam in it to 
keep the kid from drowning." 
</P>
<P>
The case remained a mystery for five years until a childhood friend of Scott's 
implicated him. The friend's statement supported police contentions that a 
family member must have committed the slaying because strangers would have been 
attacked by Dante, who has since died. 
</P>
<P>
Trapp said Scott had befriended the dog while living at the grandfather's house 
for two months before the murder. There were no signs of forced entry, 
suggesting that the killer knew that Fox kept the sliding glass bedroom door 
open at night so the dog could enter and leave at will, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott has denied guilt, saying he was at a Hollywood dance club when the 
killing occurred. Defense attorney Sherwin C. Edelberg will present his case in 
the next week or two after the prosecution rests. 
</P>
<P>
Scott told police in 1988 that the dog appeared groggy when he came to pick up 
the animal after the slaying, and he suggested that someone had drugged Dante 
to get into the house. But witnesses who saw the dog on the day of the killing 
said it appeared normal. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, Edelberg has questioned the ability of prosecution 
witnesses to accurately remember the dog's behavior before and immediately 
after the murder. He has also challenged their capacity to distinguish normal 
from abnormal behavior in dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Although Scott was not the only one who was friendly with Dante, other family 
members and friends were eliminated as suspects for lack of a motive, Trapp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, on the other hand, was having trouble finding work as an actor and 
musician, Trapp said. He thought that by inheriting Fox's house and stealing 
$20,000 worth of jewelry belonging to his grandfather that he could prevent a 
breakup with his girlfriend, Lise Rothchild, who had begun to think of him as a 
loser, Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
The dog was so intimidating that visitors to the grandfather's house had to sit 
down and let themselves be sniffed by the animal before they could be let in, 
said Richard D. Eget, Fox's roommate at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I would move carefully around the dog," Eget testified in the San Fernando 
Superior Court trial. "I wouldn't want to confront the animal. It was a guard 
dog. It was a mean animal." 
</P>
<P>
Eget was the primary suspect immediately following the killing, but he was 
released after police determined that he had no motive to shoot Fox, who had 
let him live in the house rent-free. The two had met about a year earlier 
through an alcohol rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Dante's role has been a recurring issue in a trial that has dragged on for more 
than two months. The trial had to be delayed by an attorney's illness and a 
juror's work emergency, and Christmas vacation pushed back the date of opening 
statements to mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
The slow pace has prompted Judge Howard J. Schwab to openly express his 
exasperation, saying at one point that he feared the trial would become 
"McMartinized." 
</P>
<P>
Dante's behavior, though important, is not the only clue that Scott committed 
the murder, Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Scott's boyhood friend told jurors Scott asked him three weeks after 
the murder to hock a diamond for him, which investigators later determined most 
likely had come from the grandfather's missing ring. 
</P>
<P>
The same friend testified in January that Scott asked him three days after the 
shooting whether he knew how to alter fingerprints and beat a lie-detector 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks before the shooting, Scott visited Fox's Milbank Street house with 
Rothchild and went through his grandfather's papers, possibly to look for a 
will, Trapp said. He also examined the contents of a jewelry box kept atop a 
dresser in the bedroom, but replaced it when Rothchild said it contained 
inexpensive costume jewelry, she told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The box appeared undisturbed after the murder, but the grandfather's diamond 
ring and Rolex watch were gone, so the killer, Trapp said, must have known that 
the box contained cheap jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's fingerprints were found on a flashlight from Fox's nightstand, 
indicating that he used it to see his target in the dark bedroom, Trapp said. 
Though the handgun has not been recovered, it is believed to be the same gun 
that was found missing from the grandfather's holster after the murder. Three 
.30-caliber shell casings found on the bedroom floor matched bullets stored in 
the grandfather's dresser, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case is not the only one in which a dog's behavior has provided crucial 
clues. But most other such cases have involved tracking dogs who led police to 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have frequently argued that a dog's tracking ability is not 
always reliable and should not be admitted as evidence. But one former 
prosecutor, discussing a recent dog-tracking case in Washington said, "Dogs 
don't lie."

THE HUMAN FACE OF CRIME STATISTICS; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT UP IN A BRUTAL SYSTEM THAT LEAVES THEM 
BEWILDERED AND GIVES THEM LITTLE OR NO CHANCE FOR A FAIR HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM BATSIS, Father Tom Batsis, O.Carm., is an assistant professor of 
education at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The citizens of Los Angeles are outraged at the ever-mounting crime statistics 
resulting from gang violence. This message has been conveyed to the police and 
district attorney, who have vigorously pursued and prosecuted gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Gang crime took on a whole different meaning for me two years ago, when I 
became a part-time volunteer chaplain at Central Juvenile Hall. Up to that 
point I had spent 20 years as an educator, most of my dealings being with white 
middle-class teen-agers and young adults. I did have an appreciation for the 
increased incidence of crime in our community, coming from 10 years of service 
as a chaplain with the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, however, could have prepared me for the shock I experienced as I 
stepped through the gates at "juvie," a facility housing more than 800 male and 
female offenders whose ages range from 10 to 18. Seeing children in jail is an 
experience I will never be comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
One quickly realizes that many of these boys and girls are indeed charged with 
serious felonies. But so many? 
</P>
<P>
There is also the realization that, while many of these young people probably 
have committed the crimes for which they are charged, others have been caught 
up in a brutal system responding to an outraged citizenry's call for vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
To call this a brutal system hardly conveys the reality. Maybe a comparison 
will help. If one of your children was arrested and charged with a criminal 
offense, you would probably react in a predictable manner. You would seek the 
services of a competent attorney and obtain the immediate release of your son 
or daughter from custody. You would expect to speak with your child's attorney 
on a regular basis to discuss the progress of the defense case. The hoped-for 
outcome would be to see that your child receives the best available 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast this situation with what happens to many of the youngsters I 
encounter. They usually come from minority backgrounds where, in many 
instances, English is a second, poorly understood language. Many of these 
children do not even understand why they are in jail. Court-appointed attorneys 
are theoretically representing the interests of these boys and girls, yet the 
attorneys carry such heavy caseloads that they seldom respond to the calls or 
questions of their young clients. The district attorney, following his sworn 
charge and desiring to stay in elected office, pushes for convictions. After 
all, that is what we in the community have demanded. We want criminals off the 
streets and behind bars. Unfortunately, some of these children are not very 
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
All of this took on the terrible face of reality one day in the summer of 1989, 
when I met Jose. He had been arrested in December, 1987, and charged with 
murder. While he was in jail his one remaining parent, his mother, died. Jose 
was denied permission to attend her funeral -- in my opinion an outrageous act 
of insensitivity. His case dragged on for more than a year-and-a-half before 
going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the services of a competent court-appointed attorney, Jose was nearly 
acquitted: 10 jurors favored acquittal but two did not. The district attorney 
decided to retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
Every attorney I have spoken with indicates amazement at the refiling of this 
case. An examination of the facts in the case raises serious questions about 
why it was even tried in the first place, yet the district attorney's office is 
willing to commit tens of thousands of dollars to another trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jose is now into his third year in jail, still awaiting the start of his second 
trial. At times he becomes near-suicidal as he thinks about the losses he has 
suffered, both in terms of family and the years of a youth spent in jail, along 
with the prospects of facing yet another trial with a third court-appointed 
defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time he speaks of the hopes and dreams of any young person. He 
hopes for the day when he can complete his education, begin a career and start 
to think about marriage and a family of his own. All I can do is pray that this 
maddening brutality ends and that Jose's dreams become reality. 
</P>
<P>
You may be asking yourself, "Well, is he guilty or not?" Obviously, I am 
motivated by a conviction of his innocence. However, that is not the question. 
The question remains whether or not Jose, and others like him, can receive a 
fair and impartial hearing in such a system.

WELCOME TO THE FOOD CHAIN, Y'ALL;

<P>
MEDFLY: SINCE THE PEST MAY BE WITH US FOR A WHILE, A FARM BELT NATIVE WONDERS 
IF URBAN AND RURAL INTERESTS MIGHT NOT GET TOGETHER AND FIND A SENSIBLE WAY TO 
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD RHODES, Richard Rhodes, Missouri native and a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
historian, is the author of Farm: A Year in the Life of an American Farmer 
(Simon &amp; Schuster, 1989). He lives in Massachusetts. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Y'all having trouble with them pesky flies again. Four hundred flies is all, I 
hear, trapped around Los Angeles County over the last 10 years. Hell, I've 
known farmers who trapped more flies than that in their pickup cab on a cold 
night. Probably ain't none of my business, but since the state's mixing the 
malathion with corn syrup, sliming your cars and scumming your swimming pools 
with syrup made from good Midwestern corn, I didn't think you'd mind my putting 
my two cents in. 
</P>
<P>
See, farmers got to deal with this kind of trade-off all the time. They take it 
seriously, same as you do, worry about breathing the stuff, worry about their 
kids. But there's humor in it, too, if you look hard. World would be a terrible 
place without a sense of humor. Like Lakewood City Councilman Robert G. Wagner 
saying about the chopper spraying, "I think it's overblown." Well, if it was, 
he wouldn't have a problem, would he? Or this Republican political consultant, 
Sal Russo, saying that fighting the Medfly "needs to be like Panama or Grenada. 
You've got to get in fast and win it or else it's like Vietnam." Was it using 
choppers that brought out that old boy's killer instincts or what? Did we win 
something in Grenada and Panama that I didn't hear about? 
</P>
<P>
Or that Los Angeles Times Poll that showed Republicans were more sympathetic to 
spraying than Democrats. Was that because Republicans own the orange groves, or 
because old George Deukmejian is a Republican and they're standing behind their 
man, or don't they know straight up from apple butter? Then there's the sad 
tale of the Vietnamese people at the nightclub in Garden Grove running out 
scared when the Medfly choppers came roaring over. We watch the 6 o'clock news 
out this way, after supper, and when California comes up sometimes we suspicion 
we might have turned on another weird Hollywood picture show. 
</P>
<P>
It does get to be a mite exasperating for a farmer to hear one more time around 
that city people, however well-meaning, don't mind enjoying the fruits but 
don't want to help shoulder the burden. There's people who go around parading 
for animal rights with meat in their bellies and leather shoes on their feet, 
letting someone else do their killing for them. There's people bent out of 
shape about food prices who don't want farmers to use chemicals to grow that 
food cheap. And there's people who sneeze when a little malathion-laced corn 
syrup tangerine-flakes their cars, sneering about farmers driving tractors with 
enclosed cabs and air-filtering systems. 
</P>
<P>
You've got 250 types of fruits and vegetables in California susceptible to 
Medfly infestation. If that fly gets out into the valleys and the fruit groves, 
farmers are going to have to use a lot more malathion than the state is 
spraying over the Los Angeles area these days. Spray a little in the city or a 
lot on the farm: Welcome to the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
I asked my friend Tom Bauer once about pesticides. Tom's a real farmer out in 
Missouri who harvests a thousand acres of corn and soybeans and wheat and 
raises cattle and hogs. He said he didn't have much truck with pesticides ever 
since he read on the can label about 10 years ago that he was supposed to burn 
his work clothes after he sprayed his fields. He still uses herbicides -- which 
are pesticides for plants -- to keep down weeds. But he's gone to rotating 
crops to fight pests -- corn one year, soybeans the next -- because the same 
bugs don't eat on them. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't be so easy to rotate crops out there in California, since your 
crops are trees. You might think of rotating your fruit trees with Florida's 
every other year. That would make a fine parade, all those trees crossing the 
continent back and forth on flatbed trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Spray the city or spray the farm. That looked like it in a nutshell until this 
entomologist fellow Jim Carey came along. Farmers are slow to take to experts. 
They've been burned. A lot of what farming's about ain't taught in graduate 
school. But Carey's worked up a map and it's hard to argue with. It shows 
Medflies being trapped since 1988 in all six of the areas where they turned up 
in 1980 through 1982, sometimes just a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of the other scientists on the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture's science advisory panel thought that looked more like a continuing 
population than new introductions. One of them, Richard Rice, even allowed the 
reporter who interviewed him to use his name. The panel recommended saturation 
trapping over the next two years to see if Carey's right or wrong. Out here 
we're betting he's right. Flies get around. 
</P>
<P>
If Carey's right, then the Medfly's already your neighbor. You know what that 
means. You Angelenos wasn't standing behind the door when the brains was passed 
out. It means you and the farmers over in the next valley have a common 
problem. You ought to sit down together, listen to your experts (but don't take 
their word for it) and work out something permanent. Something better than 
toad-strangler nights spraying malathion bait. Something fair to both sides, 
city people and farmers trying to grow you a decent crop. 
</P>
<P>
Y'all have howdied, but you ain't shook.

PROS AND CONS OF DECRIMINALIZING DRUGS THE IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For illustrating the opposing mentalities and styles of the doves and the hawks 
in the war on drugs, your juxtaposition of articles March 15 ("It's a Drive as 
Natural as Food or Sex" by Ronald Siegel and "Some Among Us Would Seek to 
Surrender" by Daryl Gates) is the best yet in your series. Siegel, a 
psychopharmacologist at the UCLA School of Medicine, after a professional 
lifetime studying drugs, has logically worked from facts to a sensible 
conclusion (" . . . there is a legitimate place in our society for 
intoxication"). 
</P>
<P>
Chief Gates, fearlessly brandishing absurd analogies and unsupportable 
assumptions, urges us to supply more cannon fodder for the charge of the 
Bennett brigade. Those who fail to rally to this battle cry are "fifth 
columnists." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' central assumption -- borrowed from a Bush Administration official -- is 
"that legalization might lead to a five- to six-fold increase in cocaine use." 
This means that our leaders in this war must envision tens of thousands 
law-abiding citizens restraining forbidden urges all these years only because 
of cocaine's illegality and that legalization would unleash this slavering 
horde. The only thing scary about such a scenario is that it emanates from 
people in power.

PROS AND CONS OF DECRIMINALIZING DRUGS THE IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What I found most interesting in the drug discussion was not what was said, but 
rather what wasn't said by any of the "experts." Not one pointed to the real 
reason why drugs have become a major plague in American society -- the 
powerless and alienation that millions of Americans feel toward their 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1970s, most of the drug users in black communities were musicians 
and a small group of street-corner junkies. Among whites, drug abuse was 
largely confined to Skid Row dropouts and a handful of wealthy entertainers. 
But Vietnam and Watergate changed that. Lawbreaking and the arrogance of power 
by business and government officials bred a deep cynicism in American society. 
</P>
<P>
To escape the feeling of a growing sense of discontent, millions of Americans 
turned to drugs as an attractive means of escape and fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
The drug crisis is a product of the profound social, economic and spiritual 
void in present-day America. More police, prisons, tougher laws, or even 
legalization will not solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The only real solution to the drug crisis is for Americans to have power and 
control over their lives and institutions. Anything less only dances around the 
issue. And that's what your "experts" did.

A WAY OUT OF THE 710 JAM; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 111 PROMISES RELIEF FOR LONG BEACH FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Truck drivers grit their teeth, grind their gears and deride Interstate 710 
running in and out of Long Beach because the pavement is so rough and the lanes 
so crowded. But the fact is, the 710 -- the Long Beach Freeway -- also feels 
like a washboard because it bears the pounding of so much truck traffic to and 
from the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On weekday mornings, the southbound 710 jams up with trucks trying to reach the 
port. In the evening, they clog the northbound Long Beach headed for warehouses 
or the open road. A truck standing idle in traffic can cost the owner as much 
as a dollar a minute. Ripple effects add to the loss. If a container truck is 
backed up on the 710 Freeway when the freighter is due to sail, the export 
cargo subsequently may sit on the dock for a week or more before it can resume 
its journey. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of Proposition 111 at the June 5 primary election will not cure all 
the congestion problems on the Long Beach Freeway, but widening the 710 is one 
of the priority projects eligible for the new gas-tax money. One thing for 
certain is that major improvements of this critical economic artery will be 
long in coming if the proposed gasoline-tax increase is defeated. Also, related 
projects such as improvements along the Alameda Corridor would benefit from the 
10-year, $18.5-billion transportation finance program. 
</P>
<P>
The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are working with railroads and 
neighboring cities to consolidate train traffic to and from the ports onto one 
line. Three railroads now run their own lines into the ports, all with multiple 
grade crossings that cause street congestion. One goal of the Alameda Corridor 
project is to transfer containers directly from the ship onto rail cars, thus 
keeping additional trucks off the 710 and 110 (Harbor) freeways. The 
$500-million project also would improve Alameda Boulevard so that it becomes a 
viable alternative truck route to the ports. 
</P>
<P>
Without the $3.5 billion that Proposition 111 would provide for backlogged 
highway projects, it's not likely the state would have money to spare for the 
Alameda Corridor. The measure also would generate $3 billion for cities and 
counties to use for congestion relief and $2 billion for a state-local 
transportation partnerships -- both potential sources of help for projects like 
the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Congestion costs each California motorist an estimated $1,194 annually, just in 
wasted fuel and lost time. The loss to the Southern California economy runs far 
beyond that. Other ports are trying to lure shippers frustrated by the choking 
congestion around the San Pedro Bay ports. Proposition 111 will not merely 
provide more convenience for California motorists; it will lay the foundation 
for a thriving California economy in the 1990s and into the 21st Century.

How refreshing to have so much discourse on drugs and legalization (Drugs: 
America Looks for the Way Out, Op-Ed Page, March 12-21). Now, maybe we can try 
something new instead of staying with laws that haven't worked. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the numerous authors: Carol Tavris ("Drop the Iron Fist and Try Rules 
of Moderation," March 19) was the most intelligent and should be our new drug 
czar. Terry Williams ("A World Bank for Inner-City Kids," March 19) should know 
that smoking cocaine in crack form screws up people beyond measure -- and comes 
close when it isn't in crack form -- which is why smart people like myself 
would never do that. Free use of some drugs legally, with education, need not 
be tainted by heroin or crack, which owe their markets to addicted abusers 
rather than recreational users, like pot smokers. Police Chief Daryl Gates 
(March 15) spouted off the same old "party line" which is no surprise, but 
totally useless.

BORDERLESS ECONOMY CALLS FOR NEW POLITICS;

ECONOMY: THE WORLD IS ON THE THRESHOLD OF A QUANTUM LEAP IN MATERIAL WEALTH, IF 
IT'S NOT DERAILED BY NATIONALIST EMOTION.

author of Beyond National Borders: Reflections of Japan and the World.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sony purchased Columbia Studios and Mitsubishi bought a substantial 
interest in Rockefeller Center, the opinion pages of American newspapers, 
reflecting the political mood, warned of a "Japanese invasion." Japanese 
commentators responded in their columns and on their front pages with charges 
of "bashing" by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the financial sections of these newspapers discussed the same events in 
terms of "joint ventures" or "corporate tie-ups." 
</P>
<P>
These divergent perceptions -- which are likely to be repeated with the latest 
news that Japanese concerns plan to purchase Southland Corp. (7-Eleven stores) 
and a major interest in Saks Fifth Avenue -- illustrate the conflict between 
fact and myth that has led to so much acrimony between the United States and 
Japan. The opinion pages reflect a fiction rooted in the 19th-Century notion of 
the nation-state. The financial pages reflect the reality of today's borderless 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this borderless economy, the world stands at the threshold of a 
quantum leap in material wealth -- if this promising future is not derailed by 
nationalist emotion. 
</P>
<P>
The economies of the great global triad -- America, Japan and Europe -- are so 
interwoven that loosening a few threads could unravel the entire cloth and 
expose us all to a depression. 
</P>
<P>
We often hear about Japanese investments in America, but tend to forget that 
the reverse situation also exists. IBM Japan has more than 1,000 corporate 
affiliates and more than 19,000 employees in Japan. Texas Instruments is 
Japan's strongest competitor in the production of semiconductors. Estee Lauder 
is Japan's most successful cosmetics manufacturer. In 1989, the top 2,000 
American companies operating in Japan had an annual production value greater 
than that year's $49-billion U.S.-Japan trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
This transnationalism is particularly clear in the auto industry. Ford owns 
about 25% of Mazda. General Motors, with 34% of the stock, is the largest 
shareholder in Isuzu and owns 5% of Suzuki. Chrysler owns 25% of Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan and Toyota have established major auto plants in the United States. 
Honda even exports cars back to Japan from its American plants. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Ford and GM each share about 12% of the European market. Mitsubishi 
and Daimler-Benz are negotiating a plan of intensive cooperation in automobile 
technology, aerospace and microelectronics. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to designate the nationality of these successful global 
corporations. They fly the flag of their customers, not their country. They 
thrive on the loyalty of denationalized consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The key to enduring prosperity for any nation lies in recognizing the emergence 
of the "triad marketplace" and actively participating in it. Insiders will 
prosper and grow strong. Outsiders and protectionists will wither because they 
will be unable to earn the allegiance of consumers who have plenty of choices. 
</P>
<P>
The borderless economy has two key characteristics: global commonality and 
regional differentiation. 
</P>
<P>
As national boundaries lose significance for both consumers and corporations, 
the commonalities of the triad become more important than national differences. 
At the same time, regions within national boundaries have very distinct 
attributes, tastes, needs and interests. This means, for example, that Osaka 
might compete with Tokyo and Los Angeles with New York. 
</P>
<P>
To be successful, corporations must adopt a strategy of "global localization," 
as Sony's Akio Morita has phrased it, or as I prefer, a strategy of 
"insiderization" with a multilocal approach. This simply means that successful 
companies will base their strategies on an appreciation of the unique character 
and needs of regions within national borders. 
</P>
<P>
Most Japanese companies have learned to differentiate their markets in the 
United States by regional attributes. For example, they have seen that 
subcompact cars sell best in the heavily urbanized regions while larger cars 
seem to fit the tastes of consumers in the Midwest and South. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, most American businesses still view Japan from 12,000 miles away. 
At that distance, Japan's regional consumer patterns are as indistinguishable 
as individual stars in the Milky Way. 
</P>
<P>
But the commonalities of the triad economy are far greater than the unique 
attributes of localities. In our management consulting work, we have found that 
80% of what applies in the United States also works in Germany. The consumer 
desires of the Japanese shinjinrui -- the generation younger than 30 -- are far 
more similar to the same generation in Los Angeles or Paris than they are 
different. 
</P>
<P>
As national borders continue to erode, what will emerge? 
</P>
<P>
The future's winners will not be nations, but regions, such as Alsace-Lorraine, 
Wales, Kansai or Orange County. The winning corporations will be those that 
serve the global consumer well. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians around the world will have to turn their energies away from 
preservation of the status quo to the more important mission of creating a 
political framework for the borderless economy. 
</P>
<P>
The European vision does not extend beyond 1992. The Japanese vision is even 
more shortsighted: We have been meekly hiding behind America's nuclear 
umbrella, implementing the obsolescent assignments of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. 
Meanwhile, the end of the Cold War has removed America's postwar sense of 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
A borderless economy inside a political vacuum spells peril. Without a workable 
framework, the danger is great that new villains will be created to put flesh 
on the old skeleton of nationalism. Without the Russians as archrivals, might 
an America without a mission cast the Japanese or Germans in that role? 
</P>
<P>
A xenophobic scenario such as this is what most threatens our full passage to 
the borderless economy. Only the creation of a political culture that 
reconciles the duality of citizen and consumer can clear the way.

THE BLOODY CONTEST OF PEN AND SWORD; 
</P>
<P>
JOURNALISM: THE DEATH TOLL IS LEAPING UPWARD AMONG THOSE REPORTING ON THE 
BATTLES FOR DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN POWER, Jonathan Power is a London-based columnist who writes for 
the International Herald Tribune. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-three journalists were killed on the job in 22 countries last year, the 
highest toll since records have been kept. And now with the execution in Iraq 
of Farzad Bazoft of the London Observer, 1990 already has the makings of 
surpasssing it. In the last three months, journalists have been killed in El 
Salvador, Brazil, Romania and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Bazoft met his gruesome death on the orders of President Saddam Hussein, on an 
unproven charge of spying. Only a week before, an extraordinarily brave Turkish 
journalist, Cetin Emec, chief editor and columnist of the Istanbul daily, 
Hurriyet, was shot to death by marksmen as he left home for work. In what 
turned out to be his last column, Emec wrote of his fears of the resurgence of 
terrorism in Turkey and the role of Syria in promoting it. He also argued that 
Damascus was behind the bombing of the Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland in 
December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, only nine journalists were killed. In 1983, it was 14. (Among them was 
The Times' Dial Torgerson, who was ambushed while driving on the 
Honduras-Nicaragua border.) In 1984, the toll was 21; in 1985, 31; in 1986, 19; 
in 1987, 32; in 1988, 46; last year, 63. The number arrested or detained has 
also shot up, from a low of 72 in 1984 to 225 in 1989. These are the carefully 
compiled figures of Freedom House in New York. They clearly suggest something 
is awry, but what? 
</P>
<P>
Journalism has always been a dangerous profession. During the Vietnam War, more 
journalists were killed (proportional to their numbers) than American soldiers. 
A few years ago, West German insurers gave the longevity of the average 
journalist as somewhere in the late 40s. 
</P>
<P>
But something rather different, without precedent, is afoot today. It is 
occuring in too many countries for there to be one catch-all explanation. What 
is happening, I believe, is a worldwide sea change in how journalists perceive 
their craft. Over the last decade they have become more and more disrespectful 
of those who abuse their power, whether they be governments or guerrilla 
movements. Increasingly, they insist on the hard questions, particularly ones 
that challenge an authority's conduct if it appears to have no democratic base 
and abuses the rights of those with less influence. 
</P>
<P>
This maturation of the journalistic mind is part of the harvest reaped after 30 
years of civil- and human-rights agitation in the Western world. That influence 
has moved like a wave through Western-educated and Western-oriented younger 
people all over the world. Not least, it has affected journalists who occupy 
that highly sensitive and fine-tuned midway point between politics and 
literature and have always wanted to believe that the pen is mightier than the 
sword. The post-1950s movement toward liberty and democracy has encouraged them 
to confront with growing confidence those who use power, wealth or guns for 
ignoble ends. But a price is paid for touching the nerve ends of those who have 
no compunction about being ruthless. The morbidity figures seem to suggest that 
journalists have pushed the frontiers of free reporting so far that they have 
made themselves frighteningly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
The determination to fight with the pen is certainly what drives the Colombian 
journalism fraternity, which has made a greater sacrifice than any other 
national group: 19 journalists were murdered by the Colombian drug mafia last 
year, 86 in the last decade. Along with a number of judges and political 
leaders, the journalists have taken the brunt of the drug lords' effort to 
intimidate Colombian society into cowed submission. Make no mistake about it, 
the Colombian journalists are imbued first and foremost with a sense of 
mission, not to save the bodies and souls of drug consumers in the United 
States, although of course they would be glad to see that happen, but to save 
their own precious institutions of democracy and justice. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy, too, is what drove Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, general director of 
the Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa, to fight the totalitarianism of the 
Sandinistas. Now, victorious at the polls, she is president-elect. 
</P>
<P>
And democracy is what drove a large number of journalists, Chinese and foreign, 
to cover the demonstrations and protests of Tian An Men Square last June with 
an intimacy and daring that was breathtaking. By year's end, at least 56 
Chinese journalists, including some of the most prominent, had been arrested. 
But there remains a strong underground of journalists active in China, working 
by new-day fax and old-day samizdat to keep the cause of democracy burning. 
</P>
<P>
Across much of the world, the battle for democracy and human rights has reached 
a crescendo, and journalists are on the cutting edge, capturing and shaping the 
mood. As the wave spreads, in China again, and in Africa and the Middle East, 
journalists will be there, too, and there will be more casualties.

HOSPITAL RELEASES SAGON PENN AFTER ATTEMPT TO KILL HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sagon Penn was released from Sharp Memorial Hospital early Sunday morning after 
a suicide attempt. A hospital spokeswoman said that Penn, 28, was released at 
3:50 a.m. after being brought in semi-conscious, reportedly from taking a 
combination of sleeping pills and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Penn's girlfriend, Annilie Carmichael, summoned paramedics to her home on 
Caminito Aguilar in Clairemont about 7 p.m. Saturday. Carmichael said that Penn 
had attempted suicide. Paramedics called police to check the apartment before 
treating Penn. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Penn two weeks ago when Carmichael reported that she had been 
assaulted by Penn in her home. Carmichael called police when Penn refused to 
leave. He was later charged with assaulting a police officer who was attempting 
to handcuff him. He was not prosecuted but has a court hearing on April 5, when 
the district attorney's office is expected to argue for a probation revocation. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was sentenced to three years' probation in 1989 after pleading guilty to 
misdemeanor vandalism charges stemming from a fight with an ex-girlfriend's new 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Penn was accused of killing San Diego Police Officer Thomas Riggs and 
wounding officer Donovan Jacobs and civilian ride-along Sara Pina Ruiz. He was 
acquitted of all charges in two separate trials when both juries ruled that 
police had provoked the incident by beating Penn.

KAPSTEIN PROMISES A TEAM WITH PROMISE

<P>
In Jerry Kapstein's whirlwind tour through the Padres' spring-training camp 
Sunday as the club's chief executive, he produced such a variety of campaign 
promises that players were confused whether they still were in Yuma or standing 
on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Listen up: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kapstein pledged that the Padres will be a contending team in 1990, and one 
that will make all of San Diego proud. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Promised the players that their wives now will have a stadium lounge, along 
with increased security at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vowed that the wives will have a bus available for them to travel to Dodger 
Stadium for the season-opener, and a bus to transport them from the stadium to 
the hotel at all road games in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Announced that former Padre pitcher Dave Dravecky, who retired last year 
from baseball because of cancer, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch at 
the Padre home-opener April 10. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Assured the city of Yuma that they will make all attempts to extend their 
spring-training lease past 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Any questions? 
</P>
<P>
"I did a little research with the players and their wives," Kapstein said, "and 
I got a general feeling that the players and their wives were not satisfied 
with the arrangement. So we're going to remedy it. They've had to sit outside 
in the parking lot for their husbands, so I asked our people to come up with 
facilities for the wives where they'll be comfortable and secure at the games. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first thing I wanted to do for our players. For a franchise that 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars furnishing offices, we should at least 
have a wives' room where they'll be comfortable. It only makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
Kapstein, who addressed the team for 10 minutes before they took the field, 
spent the rest of the morning surveying the Padres for the first time since 
being hired a month ago by owner Joan Kroc to oversee all operations. In just 
two hours, he came away believing that this 1990 season might be the most 
special in Padre history. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been tremendously impressed," he said. "There's an attitude and spirit 
that's very positive. It's a great feeling knowing that this club has an 
excellent chance to win the division. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing that can happen in spring training is coming and seeing 
everyone working hard, and knowing in your gut that you don't have a chance. 
Knowing you'll be out of it in June. It's so nice to know that we have a 
legitimate chance. It's foolish to say we have a great club before we start 
playing. But I know it has talent. It has chemistry. It has a very strong work 
ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be an impressive lineup. We've got speed at the top of the 
order, power in the middle of the order, and we have guys protecting each other 
throughout the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing like legitimate optimism in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres pitching rotation has been set for the season: Bruce Hurst will 
pitch the season-opener April 9 against the Dodgers, and will be followed by 
Eric Show, Andy Benes, Dennis Rasmussen and Ed Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great honor to pitch opening day," Hurst said, "but I don't want to 
make too much out of it. It's the day everybody looks forward to. That's the 
game that's always sold out, and then you have 15,000 the next game. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want to blow it out of proportion. When I retire, it's not going 
to be a thing where I say, 'Gee, how many opening days did I pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst is 0-1 with one no-decision in his two previous opening day starts. His 
last season-opener was in 1986 for Boston against the Detroit Tigers. Hurst 
carried a 1-0 lead into the ninth inning. He walked the leadoff hitter, and was 
relieved by Lee Smith. Smith recorded the next two outs, but then gave up a 
two-run homer to Alan Trammell, resulting in a 2-1 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget the headline of the Boston Herald the next day," Hurst said. 
" 'Wait 'til Next Year.' " 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes, who has tendinitis in his right shoulder, said that he felt much 
better Sunday during batting practice. He still has some soreness, but pitching 
coach Pat Dobson said that he pitched the best since camp opened. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to go out there and cut loose," Benes said, "but I know I can't do 
that right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will make up their three canceled games against the Dodgers on Oct. 
1-3 at Dodger Stadium, according to sources. Their three lost home games 
against the Cincinnati Reds, sources say, will be made up July 25 as part of a 
double header; Aug. 1, which originally was a scheduled off-day; and either 
Sept. 21 or Sept. 22, as part of a double header. Their official revised 
schedule is expected to be announced today by the National League office. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres open their Cactus League schedule at 12:05 p.m. PST today against 
the Angels at Desert Sun Stadium. The Padres' lineup, Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said, will be: Bip Roberts, SS; Roberto Alomar, 2B; Tony Gwynn, RF; Fred Lynn, 
LF; Mark Parent, C; Mike Pagliarulo, 3B; Shawn Abner, CF; Rob Nelson, 1B; and 
Bruce Hurst, P. Four of the Padres' regular starters -- first baseman Jack 
Clark, center fielder Joe Carter, catcher Benito Santiago and shortstop Garry 
Templeton -- will not even suit up, McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who have a "B" game Tuesday against the Angels, added another "B" 
game Friday against the Seattle Mariners. They now will play nine games in the 
first six days, with a double header scheduled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get as many games in as possible," McKeon said. "You can practice 
all you want, but it's not the same as game action."

KGTV STICKS TO SHALLOW END IN CHATS WITH S.D. CELEBRITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Barbara Walters has made the celebrity interview into a successful art form, 
cranking out highly rated programs of chats with pop celebrities. The 
questioning rarely goes deeper than, "If you were a tree, what kind of tree 
would you be?," producing light and easy shows with all the meat of a People 
magazine feature. 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10) follows Walters' latest foray into pop fluff tonight with its 
local version of the tried and true format, hosted by "Inside San Diego" 
personalities Laura Buxton and Bill Griffith. It is scheduled to begin at 10 
p.m., depending on the length of the Academy Awards telecast earlier in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
To their credit, the "Inside San Diego" producers found three interesting 
people to spotlight -- former mayor turned radio talk-show host Roger 
Hedgecock, San Diego Union cartoonist and stand-up comedian Steve Kelley, and 
former KFMB-TV (Channel 8) anchorwoman Allison Ross. Hedgecock and Kelley 
proudly carry "controversial" labels, while Ross, who has been laying low since 
being dumped by Channel 8 last summer, has a story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Walters was touted in an article last year for her ability to attract reclusive 
guests to her programs, which is hardly surprising. The celebs love the shows. 
It's an opportunity to present themselves on their own terms, paced by Walters' 
softball questions. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel 10 special follows the format line by line, presenting each of the 
three guests in the cozy environments of their own homes, including Kelley in 
his "penthouse." Rarely scratching below the surface, the show falls far short 
of its promise to present the three as they've never been seen before. 
</P>
<P>
Buxton takes Hedgecock over well-trod ground, playing up Hedgecock's role as a 
family man. It's interesting, but Buxton never comes close to cracking 
Hedgecock's mask, nevertheless presenting a "very personal profile of a very 
private Roger Hedgecock." 
</P>
<P>
Incessantly perky Griffith's chat with Kelley provides the program's biggest 
laughs, and not just from Kelley's jokes. Griffith wades in with such subtle, 
thought-provoking questions as "Are you a racist?" and "Are you sexist?," as if 
Kelley might answer, "Why, yes, I am a racist." Kelley provides some insights 
into the calculating world of comedy, but Griffith's questioning is laughable. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three, the interview with Ross is most interesting because Ross uses it 
as a forum to publicly discuss, for the first time, her problems with manic 
depression and the stress of being a popular anchorwoman. It is a side of Ross 
most haven't seen. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the Ross interview rings shallow. It is hard to feel sorry for 
Ross, who had an unprecedented 11-year run at Channel 8 in a business where two 
to three years is considered long term, and she never faced the type of 
aggressive media coverage found in most cities. Buxton had a far tougher time 
of it, ultimately being fired as KNSD-TV's (Channel 39) main anchorwoman after 
years of competing with Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Ross declines to answer questions about her sudden departure from Channel 8, 
the question on the minds of most viewers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ross (like Hedgecock) has been talking to Channel 10 about a job, 
giving the whole segment the ring of a commercial for Channel 10's next hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the interviews are light and friendly, and will probably be enjoyable to 
viewers who read People magazine and watch Walters' special. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect to get an Esquire feature from People magazine.

GREYHOUND STRIKE BECOMES FERTILE FIELD FOR VIOLENCE

<P>
To expect that one dependent upon his daily wage for the necessities of life 
will stand peacefully by and see a man employed in his stead is to expect too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Industrialist Andrew Carnegie 
</P>
<P>
"Why take it out on the passengers?" Mark Lawson demanded last week after 
somebody fired a small-caliber rifle at a Greyhound bus that was carrying him 
and 50 other people between Roanoke and Christiansburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
That question is being asked with increasing desperation in the wake of 21 
reported bus-sniping incidents -- two of which have caused injuries to 
passengers -- during the 3-week-old strike by 9,000 Greyhound drivers and other 
members of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Locals. 
</P>
<P>
If the polarized history of American labor relations is any judge, no one is 
likely to find a satisfactory answer. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound, echoing generations of employers who view organized labor as a 
"cartel" that uses strike violence to keep wages artificially high, claims the 
shootings are orchestrated by union leaders to discourage ridership. 
</P>
<P>
The Greyhound locals, echoing generations of union leaders who believe much 
strike violence is provoked by management, claim the shootings are the work of 
a handful of "fruitcakes," as one Los Angeles striker described them. 
</P>
<P>
However, according to the few academics who have studied patterns of strike 
violence, there is little reason to be surprised that the Greyhound strike has 
grown so nasty. Although no more than 5% to 10% of strikes involve violence to 
people or property, according to various estimates, the nature of the Greyhound 
strike makes it a virtual breeding ground for an eruption. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers -- unable to slow down the pace of replacement hiring and unable 
to draw their employer back to the negotiating table -- suffer from an intense 
"vulnerability" that classically motivates most strike violence, said Michael 
Wallace, an Ohio State University sociology professor who co-authored an 
article on strike violence to be published later this year in the American 
Journal of Sociology. 
</P>
<P>
Dispassionate observations like Wallace's are rarely part of a strike. Strike 
violence seems to defy such analysis because it traditionally takes place in 
war-like settings in which the propaganda arms of management and labor struggle 
for public sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace and co-author Don Sherman Grant said strikes become violent because 
unions exist in "ambiguous circumstances." In contrast to "outsider" groups 
seeking political recognition, such as 1960s student demonstrators, unions are 
"weak insiders" -- part of the system but always at risk of losing ground. 
</P>
<P>
Unions, which have won only marginal public acceptance as a vital institution, 
cannot afford to employ violence in an offensive manner without "alienating 
allies and sympathizers," Wallace and Sherman said. "However, if their position 
within the system weakens to the point that past gains are jeopardized," or if 
"the union's very existence is jeopardized," violence may be employed by 
frustrated union members. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace said the Greyhound strike meets virtually every test of such a 
scenario: 
</P>
<P>
* It involves workers who can be relatively easily replaced, as opposed to auto 
workers or aerospace machinists, whose training is more extensive and 
specialized. 
</P>
<P>
* It involves an employer who has continued operating, the tactic "most likely 
to provoke a violent response." Greyhound has been hiring permanent 
replacements, not merely strikebreakers. As a result strikers may not get their 
jobs back unless the National Labor Relations Board upholds an unfair labor 
practices complaint. By contrast, the last time Greyhound was struck in 1983, 
its owners responded slowly and were forced to shut the system down entirely 
for two weeks before gradually resuming operation with replacements. 
</P>
<P>
* The people who pose the most direct threat to the union -- the 1,100 
replacement drivers and a far smaller number of union drivers who have crossed 
the picket line -- are spread across the country, rather than concentrated at a 
single work site. That creates unlimited potential for attacks on isolated 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
* The longer a strike is prolonged while the company stays open, the worse the 
union's chances look. As the strike entered its fourth week Friday, Greyhound 
was showing little enthusiasm for resuming negotiations, and many strikers had 
already been forced to seek part-time jobs to support themselves. 
</P>
<P>
* Strikers were on the defensive even before they struck. Their union had 
accepted wage cuts of 8% and 23% in the 1983 and 1987 contracts in response to 
company pleas that Greyhound could not survive in a deregulated market unless 
it cut fares. The current strike came when workers demanded some of the money 
back. 
</P>
<P>
* Strikers have suffered the only fatality of the strike. Veteran driver Robert 
Waterhouse was killed on the second day of the strike when a bus driven by a 
replacement worker pinned him against the wall at a bus depot in Redding. No 
criminal charges have yet been filed against the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Neil N. Bernstein, a labor law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, 
suggested that the shooting at buses is a last-ditch effort to discourage what 
he called "a stampede" of picket-line crossing by union drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been for people shooting at buses, you would have had a 
substantial amount of (crossing) by now," he said. "That's what's really 
holding the strike together. That's what in my mind makes the whole thing very 
troublesome." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said a 1985 Supreme Court ruling allowing union members to resign 
from their union during a strike and return to work without having to pay heavy 
union fines took away a union's traditional power over its membership. "The 
unions have no legal recourse to save their integrity and their supporters' 
jobs," he said. "The only thing they can do is resort to illegal tactics. . . . 
It's a clear sign that the system has broken down." 
</P>
<P>
That Supreme Court ruling is only one of a variety of rulings by courts and the 
National Labor Relations Board in the last decade that have weakened the 
institutional power of unions. These changes, along with more aggressive 
tactics on the part of employers -- including the hiring of replacement workers 
instead of temporary strikebreakers -- are responsible for a drastic decrease 
in the frequency of strikes. They are also responsible, organized labor leaders 
say, for considerable frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound passengers, many of whom continue to ride the strike-plagued system 
because they cannot afford alternatives, have been relatively lucky. Although 
many of the shots have pierced bus windows, the only serious injuries occurred 
March 11 when glass and bullet fragments hospitalized seven passengers on a bus 
near Jacksonville, Fla. So far only one union member has been arrested. He has 
been charged with shooting at a bus in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
As a brief attempt at renewed negotiations fell apart last week, both sides in 
the strike portrayed themselves as victims of intentional violence. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound executives flatly accused union leaders of sanctioning "acts of 
terrorism," ranging from the shootings to nearly 50 bomb threats. Union leaders 
accused Greyhound's replacement drivers of running their buses into nearly 50 
bus-terminal pickets. Greyhound said it would not talk to union negotiators 
until the shooting stopped. Union leaders said they had condemned the violence 
and called Greyhound's demand a dishonest justification for the company's 
intransigence. 
</P>
<P>
James Fox, professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said union 
members who commit violence during strikes "aren't necessarily violence-prone, 
but given the right conditions they can justify violence, the same way we 
rationalize it in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
"Scabs are the enemy. Where the usually violent person is more expressive -- 
violence makes him feel good, he gets a feeling of control, of power -- this 
kind of (strike) violence is instrumental violence. It comes from what 
criminologists call an appeal to a higher loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bleiweiss, a Calabasas union consultant, said he was offended at the 
suggestion made frequently by opponents of unions that unions are particularly 
prone to violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Violence is an integral part of the American psyche," he said. "We talk a good 
game about being pacifistic, and nonviolence is very much in the vocabulary. 
But when you examine any era in American history, when people want something 
passionately enough, they fight for it. It's unfair to say that just labor 
unions do this. Violence in America is a cultural thing. We send our children 
to movies at age 6 and they learn it's perfectly all right to carry a gun and 
use it before the end of the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Management lobbyists, led by the anti-union National Right to Work Legal 
Defense Foundation, have long insisted that changes in federal law are needed 
to crack down on strike violence. They have pushed unsuccessfully for a bill 
that would make strike violence punishable by laws covering extortion.

LIFE AFTER WALL ST. -- RUDE JOLTS; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSANDS OF LUCRATIVE FINANCIAL CAREERS CAME TO AN END WITH THE 'GOLDEN YEARS' 
OF THE '80S. YET NOT ALL VETERANS OF THE BOOM ARE SORRY IT COULDN'T LAST.

<TEXT>
<P>
For nine years, Scott Discount lived the classic '80s success story of the 
young man who finds wealth and status above the restless gorges of Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's living a story that's more typical of the new decade. 
</P>
<P>
Discount was thrown out of work last January when his employer, First American 
Bank, closed the trading desk where he supervised the buying and selling of 
yen, marks and other currencies. In the morning, when he used to wrestle with a 
heaving, $400-billion market, he now drives a circuit of New York food stores 
to drop off the cakes he bakes for his one-man enterprise, "Scotty Wotty's 
Creamy Cheesecakes." 
</P>
<P>
"This has given me a whole new perspective," said Discount, 32, whose high 
school classmates voted him "most likely to succeed" and who earned up to 
$150,000 a year as chief currency trader. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of about 40,000 people thrown out of work at the end of a boom that 
showered wealth on Wall Street for seven golden years. Investment bankers, 
traders, brokers -- and countless clerks and secretaries -- have been cast from 
fabled prosperity into a difficult present with an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
It's a life of rude shocks: dwindling bank accounts, unemployment lines and 
interviews with prospective employers who confide that they always considered 
the Wall Street crowd overpaid and overbearing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the displaced lament that they will never again live in the comfort 
they enjoyed in the palmy '80s. Others are finding that swapping the big bucks 
for more free time and less pressure can be quite agreeable, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
It's all a result of the worst Wall Street downturn since the Great Depression, 
a recession that may leave employment in the industry 65,000 jobs off its peak 
of 262,000 in 1987. The convulsions began with the October, 1987, stock market 
crash and continued with the deterioration of the high-yield junk bond market 
last fall and a slowdown in the pace of corporate takeovers that long nourished 
investment banks with huge fees. 
</P>
<P>
Giant financial concerns such as Merrill Lynch, Shearson Lehman Hutton and 
Prudential-Bache Securities lost money last year. The collapse of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert, mortally wounded by weak markets and legal problems, dumped 
5,300 people on the job market last month. 
</P>
<P>
In the New York area, securities firms have laid off 17,000 employees and 
perhaps thousands of others have lost jobs at Wall Street-dependent businesses 
-- law firms, financial printers, restaurants, limousine services and real 
estate firms. But Wall Street's distress 
</P>
<P>
touches all corners of the economy, and thousands of jobs may also be lost in 
Southern California as the recession ripples through securities firms, pension 
funds, insurance companies, thrifts and other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In their enforced idleness, Wall Street's displaced have had time to think 
about the golden age that is quickly passing into history. Again and again in 
conversation, they recall how people knew the good times had to end, yet they 
spent without hesitation on the restaurant meals, East Side co-op apartments, 
vacation homes and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
They talk about F. Scott Fitzgerald's reflections on a time of ease and excess 
seven decades ago. And they allude to places like Golconda, the jewel-studded 
city of Indian legend. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the young people to enjoy their stroll through Golconda," said one 
former Drexel executive. "And I told them it wouldn't last." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Discount had a trying time at the unemployment office the other day, but 
it could have been worse. He found it reassuring to pull into a parking lot 
filled with expensive cars (including a Mercedes); it was a sign that former 
Wall Street peers were there ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, when he reached the line, one fellow ahead of him was from Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard I was being laid off, I was embarrassed, and at first I tried to 
hide it from people," Discount recalled. "Then I decided, the hell with it -- 
now it's almost in vogue to be in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been traumatic, he says, trying to adjust to the loss of a job that was 
so essential to his identity. "People would ask you who you were, and you would 
say, 'trader,' " he said. "In this situation, you've got to start to think of 
yourself not as a job title but as a person who can solve all sorts of 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The quick change of careers has left him with a few awkward minor problems, 
such as the $1,000 Ralph Lauren suit he sent in for alterations before the 
layoff and hasn't yet retrieved. He doesn't have much use for it now, since he 
makes his deliveries in jeans and tennis shoes and never wears anything 
dressier than khaki slacks. 
</P>
<P>
Discount bakes his cheesecakes from his mother's recipe. He is selling several 
dozen cakes a week to fancy Manhattan stores such as Dean &amp; DeLuca and 
Bloomingdale's. He thinks he can expand the business quickly, but if it doesn't 
work out, he's ready to reconsider his options. 
</P>
<P>
He has had to abandon the idea of buying a house and he can't travel as much as 
he used to. His new work also isn't as intellectually stimulating as the old, 
he acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said: "There's not the ulcer-creating pressure, and if I 
want to go to the zoo in the middle of the day, there's nothing to stop me." 
</P>
<P>
He's a former Drexel executive, now working as a stockbroker and looking back 
on the '80s as some of his happiest years. "There was no better place to work 
on Earth than on Wall Street in the '80s," this veteran of two decades on the 
street says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he believes that the pay and spending habits of Wall Street professionals, 
and their opinions of their own worth, began to get out of line as the Dow 
Jones industrial average moved higher and higher. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the Indians who discovered gushers of oil under our tepees," said the 
executive, who requested anonymity. "What does that say about our talents? I'd 
say the money was a temporary demand aberration -- maybe not a function of our 
particular operating skills. Anybody who assumed it would all continue was 
foolish." 
</P>
<P>
Once a colleague proposed that he hire a young man two years out of business 
school for a salary of several hundred thousand dollars. "Nobody just out of 
school should be making more than the President makes, I told him," he said. 
"We didn't hire the guy." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran doesn't now face a personal financial crisis because he held down 
expenses and saved. He has owned the same house in suburban Westchester County 
for more than 10 years. His two children go to public schools and he drives a 
station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't the same for all of his peers. He knows several who are struggling 
with deep debts they took on to buy company stock, apartments and vacation 
homes. Now some of them are facing personal bankruptcy; others, older men, are 
trying to rebuild their careers at a time in their lives when they had planned 
to cut back their work schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"People accumulated all these things as trophies of new wealth," the veteran 
said, "but they didn't earn them -- they borrowed to take them home. Now their 
jobs are gone and their debts remain." 
</P>
<P>
He would not guess by how much his income might fall this year from its former 
high point, but, he said, he's happy to "get back to the basics of the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
The moneymaking excesses of the '80s were "sort of like eating Big Macs," he 
said. "You eat a few, they taste good; you eat a lot more. Only later do you 
find out about the calories and fat and cholesterol." 
</P>
<P>
It was Thanksgiving week last year when Doris Lederer learned that she had lost 
her job as sales-trader at Salomon Bros.' equity options and futures desk. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real surprise, even though there were signs that layoffs were 
coming," said Lederer, who is 38. She was taken aback because she was No. 2 in 
the department, had a good reputation and was supporting a husband who is still 
in law school. 
</P>
<P>
But losing her job helped her make up her mind to move on to a career that 
would allow her more time with her family, if less compensation. Though she has 
since had other offers from Wall Street, she plans to move this summer to 
Phoenix and open, with her sister, a fashion accessories store they plan to 
call Notorious. 
</P>
<P>
Lederer moved to Wall Street seven years ago after earning a Ph.D. in 
educational psychology. She doesn't regret it. "It was a challenging career at 
an exciting time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A typical trader on her desk earned between $250,000 and $400,000 a year before 
the slowdown, and some earned much more. 
</P>
<P>
But her interest had been flagging. After the 1987 crash, trading was thinner 
and competition for the client's dollar was tougher. 
</P>
<P>
Lederer had grown tired of what she considered the "frat house 
</P>
<P>
atmosphere of the trading floor" and felt that the firm didn't offer women the 
opportunities it held for men. 
</P>
<P>
And the hours were long. Lederer left home in Hoboken, N.J., just across the 
Hudson River from the Manhattan financial district, at about 6:30 a.m., before 
her infant son awakened. By the time she returned at night, he was cranky and 
ready to go to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Often her job involved entertaining clients after hours, too. 
</P>
<P>
Another Wall Street firm recently offered her a job that would have allowed her 
to stay home a little later in the morning -- if she would promise to begin 
selling on the phone before she left. 
</P>
<P>
She considers herself part of a group that some have called the "new 
traditionalists," people who are adjusting their careers to give themselves 
more time for themselves and their families. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Lederer said, she expects to live on half the amount she paid in 
taxes in 1989. "And I expect the quality of my life to improve dramatically," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The young investment banker acknowledges that he is pretty desperate for a job. 
But he wouldn't think of working for the financial-services company executive 
who interviewed him the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy almost said straight out he was glad the people on Wall Street were 
finally getting theirs," the banker said. 
</P>
<P>
The financier, in his early 30s, was talking through a speaker phone from his 
Manhattan co-op apartment one recent afternoon. He has been spending a lot of 
time studying his walls and ceiling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes he can land a job but worries that his next salary won't be 
enough to cover his debts. It's a familiar plaint: He made several hundred 
thousand dollars a year but borrowed heavily to buy two vacation homes and the 
co-op, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
He calls people who now criticize such borrowing habits "incredible 
second-guessers." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us have gotten in jams by borrowing heavily, but others have made 
fortunes with smart leveraging," he said. "Some people were saying in 1983 that 
the expansion couldn't last, but it did -- it went on and on." 
</P>
<P>
The banker concedes that the spending habits of his colleagues did influence 
him to buy more and spend heavily on entertaining. "To be taken seriously by 
these people, you had to live like them. That was business," he says. 
</P>
<P>
As the wind scatters a blizzard of Wall Street resumes, some employers are 
enjoying a buyer's market. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are a few profitable Wall Street investment banks, commercial banks, 
regional investment firms and foreign financial firms that are trying to expand 
their footholds in the United States -- such as Nomura Securities of Japan and 
County NatWest Securities of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Drexel Burnham Lambert refugees are starting investment-banking 
boutiques. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. has hired about 60 people from 
the defunct firm, including corporate restructuring experts, commodities 
specialists and money-managers. Another 40 of them have gone to work for County 
NatWest. 
</P>
<P>
But when some get hired, others may get bumped. While Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
has hired 14 people from Drexel, it also has displaced some employees in its 
Boston office to make room for six bond salesmen from Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Executive recruiters say that the job hunters in the top tier -- which includes 
proven moneymakers -- seem to glide effortlessly to new roosts. There is also 
some demand for younger professionals, perhaps in part because of their lower 
salary expectations and presumed greater energy. 
</P>
<P>
Life may be bitter for those in a middle group who have experience and have 
commanded higher salaries but are deal "processors" rather than deal makers. 
"These guys are turning right and left looking everywhere, until their necks 
are stiff," said Robert S. Rollo, managing director of the Korn Ferry 
International search firm. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's new reality is reflected in the pay packages now offered 
investment bankers with the minimum experience. 
</P>
<P>
Before, a junior banker might have gotten a $50,000 base salary and a 
guaranteed first-year bonus of between $50,000 and $150,000. Now the salary's 
the same but the bonus may be $50,000 at the maximum, said Allan Stern, partner 
in the Haskell &amp; Stern search firm. 
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment has created some incongruous situations. 
</P>
<P>
A recently dismissed trader found herself standing in line in a store with a 
"$1 off" coupon for Pampers -- wearing the mink coat she had bought while 
employed. "My friend who pointed it out was hysterical," the trader recalled. 
</P>
<P>
She used to spend money without thinking. Now she's starting to cook at home 
and goes to restaurants for the late afternoon cut-price dinner specials. No 
more Broadway shows and after-theater dinners; she and her husband go to the 
museums on Friday and Saturday nights, when the prices are low. 
</P>
<P>
They're thinking about selling their East Side apartment before New York co-op 
prices, which have fallen about 15% from their peak, fall further. Then they 
may buy a home in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
But the financial worries aren't as unbearable as the tension she and others 
endured while waiting to find out whether their jobs would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they take you into this room, and a man comes in and says, 'I'm 
going to shoot you,' " she said. "Maybe they do give you the bad news that day; 
or maybe they don't and you have to suffer through it the next day." 
</P>
<P>
In California, Deborah Wall, 34, found out that her Drexel division was being 
closed the day after she made the first payment on a new house in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
That was last May. She was shocked but not immediately frightened because she 
thought she had another job lined up at Citicorp. It was when that expected job 
fell through, in July, that "absolute and total panic set in." 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who had been chief West Coast credit officer for a Drexel division, tried 
to discipline herself to make 10 job-hunting calls a day and set up a number of 
interviews. "If I didn't meet my goal, I'd feel like a failure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall didn't find a job last summer. She spent four months as a temporary 
secretary and only recently landed a job with a venture capital firm. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't bother her that she had to take a temporary step down in her career. 
"The important thing was working and hanging onto the house," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her message for others considering careers with Wall Street firms: "If you're 
looking for stability, you're not going to find it." 
</P>
<P>
Financiers and traders get the attention on Wall Street, but more than 
two-thirds of those who work there -- and most of those who have lost their 
jobs -- are more modestly paid members of support staff, including an army of 
computer operators, clerks, accountants and secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
Since she lost her position as a secretary at Drexel, Nettie Buonomo, 68, has 
worried about losing much of her hospitalization coverage. It was important to 
her because she had a mastectomy last year. 
</P>
<P>
She can apply for Medicare but says has heard stories about how inferior the 
care may be. "I'm scared to death," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Buonomo, who lives with her poodle, Rags, in her seven-room house in Avenel, 
N.J., says she could use some extra money but hasn't decided whether to try to 
find work again. "I should think about looking for another job, but I've been 
too befuddled by what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Buonomo, one of 11 children, describes herself as "one of those old-time 
Italians who really know the value of a dollar." She wants to make it clear 
that she's not crying poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just sorry for those young kids who were used to making the megabucks," 
she said. "What are they going to do?" 
</P>

AT 105, CLAIRE O'ROURKE IS JUST GETTING STARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
QUINCY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the three dozen or so senior citizens who regularly eat their weekday lunch 
at Veteran's Hall in this small Northern California mountain town, Claire 
O'Rourke is a continuing source of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
In part, it's a matter of constancy. As treasurer of Quincy's Senior Citizen 
Nutrition Program, O'Rourke is always on the job, collecting money for the 
$1.50 lunches, doling out change and keeping the books. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, it's a matter of time, and the apparent lack of effect its passing 
has had on O'Rourke. At 105, she is spry, alert and independent. 
</P>
<P>
"Claire is unbelievable. She has a kid older than me," said Jessie Spaulding, 
one of the lunch program's regular diners. He is 82; O'Rourke's only child, 
Francis, will be 84 in May. 
</P>
<P>
"She gets around better than I do," volunteered Fanny Cole, 66. "And, she's old 
enough to be my grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
Tony del Collo, 67, who drives the bus that transports the lunch program's 
patrons, said he can usually count on O'Rourke to help most of his passengers 
on and off the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Said Del Collo: "She helps 70- and 80-year-old men and women. I am always 
astounded by Claire's stamina at her age." 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke, who said she has never been seriously ill a day in her life, takes 
such remarks in stride and counts her blessings. "I'm thankful every day to be 
here, grateful that I am able to do the things I do and get around the way I 
do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She lives alone, cooking her own meals and doing her own housework in her 
143-year-old home. A senior citizen bus calls for her twice a week to take her 
shopping for groceries and other items. She putters in her garden. She has her 
hair done every week. She frequently goes out to dinner with friends and never 
misses the monthly meeting of the local Order of the Eastern Star, a women's 
group associated with the Masons. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke, who stands only 5-feet tall and has always been slightly built, was 
born in the tiny town of La Porte, 40 miles south of Quincy, on Jan. 23, 1885. 
The Civil War had been over for less than 20 years. The population of Los 
Angeles was less than 50,000. Chester A. Arthur was president; Franklin D. 
Roosevelt was a week away from celebrating his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke's parents had seven children; she was the oldest. All were born in La 
Porte's Union Hotel, which was operated by her mother and father. Her last 
sibling died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of a lone wolf. Nobody is left from my earlier years. They're all 
gone. It's scary, but I don't dwell on it. I haven't any idea why I'm still 
here," she mused. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke has lived in Plumas County in the northern Sierra all her life. She 
married a local boy, Leonard O'Rourke, in 1905. She describes him as a 
"jack-of-all-trades" who eventually got into politics. 
</P>
<P>
He served as a county supervisor for 12 years and had been county treasurer for 
two years when he died at age 74 in 1949. She took over the office that year 
and served in it until 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Although she mostly lives in the present, O'Rourke occasionally pauses to 
reflect on the almost unimaginable changes she's witnessed. "When I was a girl 
there were no cars. We rode horses and in horse-drawn buggies. We had no 
electricity when I was young, no telephones, no radio or television, of course. 
All that came later. What a life I've had." 
</P>
<P>
Not that she's ready to call it quits. "You know, I was 14 going on 15 when the 
1800s ended and 1900 began," she said. "I would sure like to see the year 2000. 
That would really be nice. I'm having such a good time that I'm planning on 
hanging around awhile longer."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
TAX MEASURE TAKES NEW TRANSIT PLANNING TACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If California voters approve Proposition 111 in June, billions of dollars will 
be generated for new transportation projects from the Oregon state line to the 
Mexican border over the next 10 years, Gov. George Deukmejian and other 
supporters of the measure say. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111 would double the state gasoline tax over a five-year period, 
increase truck fees and raise the legal limit on state spending. It also would 
lead to dramatic changes in state transportation planning, officials of the 
California Department of Transportation contend. 
</P>
<P>
However, as a $5-million campaign gets under way to promote Proposition 111 and 
a companion measure, Proposition 108, the emphasis is on what the new money 
would buy. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of advocates are fanning out across the state, offering rosy promises of 
new projects if the two ballot measures pass and predicting a bleak, 
traffic-choked future if they do not. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, they talk of building an interchange on Highway 101 at Valley 
Circle in the San Fernando Valley (cost: $25.7 million); of building an 
interchange connecting routes 60 and 71, near Pomona ($42 million), and of 
widening the Simi Valley Freeway ($10.3 million). 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents are being told that the new state money is needed to 
ensure completion of the massive $1.9-billion Santa Ana Freeway widening 
project. In San Bernardino County, some of the new money would be used to build 
California 30, a long-awaited east-west link with Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, the sales teams are saying passage of Propositions 108 and 
111 would mean construction of an interchange between Interstate 5 and 
California 56, near Del Mar; upgrading California 76, near Oceanside, to a 
four-lane expressway; and starting the Interstate 15-40th Street Freeway, among 
about $225 million worth of projects. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Transportation Committee staff members have estimated that Los Angeles 
County would receive about $4.5 billion of the estimated $18.5 billion in new 
revenue that would be generated statewide over the next 10 years. (Of that, 
$15.5 billion would come from increases in gasoline and diesel fuel taxes and 
truck weight fees, the rest from passage of three $1-billion rail bond issues 
in 1990, 1992 and 1994.) 
</P>
<P>
However, supporters are careful not to mention that passage of Proposition 111 
might lead to construction of such controversial projects as the extension of 
the Long Beach Freeway through the city of South Pasadena. That $470-million 
freeway link does not appear on the Caltrans list of projects that would 
definitely be completed but does appear on a list of "possible candidates" for 
Proposition 111 funding.

<P>
State officials warn that Propositions 108 and 111 offer a last chance to 
relieve the traffic congestion that is making life miserable in and around 
California's major cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a window of opportunity to do something about the transportation 
crisis that's coming closer to more and more peoples' doorsteps," Caltrans 
Director Robert K. Best said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to pass the ballot measures means that needed transportation 
improvements would be delayed 10 to 12 years or longer, said Pete Hathaway, 
deputy director for finance of the California Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
However, certain major projects like the 18-mile Century Freeway and light-rail 
project between Los Angeles International Airport and Norwalk ($375 million in 
remaining costs) almost certainly would be completed, although they might be 
delayed if Proposition 111 fails and no other source of funding appears. 
</P>
<P>
The congestion crisis has been building for a long time, as the California 
Transportation Commission's 1989 report to the Legislature made clear: 
</P>
<P>
* Between 1966 and 1986, California's population increased by 42%; personal 
income, adjusted for inflation, by 103%; the total state budget, adjusted for 
inflation, by 130%; but state transportation spending, after inflation, 
declined by 35%. 
</P>
<P>
* The 1989 consumer price index was 325% higher than in 1965, but revenue from 
the state gasoline tax (now 9 cents per gallon) has increased only 30% since 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
* Since 1966, the number of vehicles in California has nearly doubled, and 
miles traveled on state highways have increased by 129%, but state highway 
construction spending has dropped to only 45% of 1966 levels. 
</P>
<P>
* California now ranks last among the 50 states in per capita spending for 
transportation, while only four states have a lower gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these and other factors, the commission found, traffic 
congestion has been growing by 15% to 20% a year in the Los Angeles and San 
Francisco areas; stop-and-go driving conditions exist on 60% of the state's 
urban freeways; and congestion delays amount to about 400,000 hours per day, at 
an annual cost in lost work time of more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has become so serious that Deukmejian has abandoned his 
no-new-taxes approach and is leading the effort to gain voter approval of 
Propositions 108 and 111. 
</P>
<P>
"Freeway gridlock dirties our air," the governor said in a recent statewide 
radio talk. "It diminishes our quality of life. And it hurts our ability to 
create good-paying jobs for your children, because businesses will be forced to 
pack up and move out of our state, unless we take bold action now." 
</P>
<P>
As vital as the new money is, the change in state transportation planning that 
would be triggered by passage of the propositions, especially 111, is equally 
important, Best said. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years we have been designing projects to capture the revenue that was 
available," he said, which mostly has been Federal Interstate Highway money. 
"Now we're trying to turn that around and match the money with the project." 
</P>
<P>
The new approach is best seen in the $3 billion that would be spent on a new 
"flexible congestion relief" program, in which Caltrans engineers and local 
transportation planners would seek alternatives to building more freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll go in and look at all the ways congestion can be relieved in a 
particular situation," Best said. "It might be transit (bus or rail). It might 
be ride-sharing or improving the traffic signal system or upgrading the 
arterial roads that parallel the freeway. Or it might be that expanding freeway 
capacity is the best way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Allan H. Hendrix, chief of program development for Caltrans, said: "This is an 
acknowledgement that you can't solve congestion just with highway solutions." 
</P>
<P>
This new emphasis on flexibility pleases legislators who have criticized 
Caltrans in the past for trying to solve all congestion problems by building 
freeways or adding freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to change Caltrans from a highway department to an agency that 
looks at all the possible solutions to traffic congestion problems," said 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Local transportation officials also seem to be pleased by the new approach. 
</P>
<P>
"This can't help but improve the way we've been making decisions," said Mike 
Hoffacker, executive director of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments. 
"The change will be gradual, but over the next few years I think you'll see the 
projects that are competing for state dollars will be the projects that are 
most effective in dealing with traffic congestion and air quality." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the new flexibility might mean more money for projects like the 
Santa Monica Freeway "smart corridor," where a sophisticated, computerized 
system will tell drivers whether to remain on the freeway or switch to less 
crowded arterial streets. 
</P>
<P>
Or it could mean more money to extend the El Monte Busway to the Ontario 
Airport or to add a bus and car-pool lane to the San Diego Freeway, between Los 
Angeles International Airport and the Orange County line. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Caltrans District Director Keith McKean said, flexibility 
might mean that planners would decide to improve the traffic signal system on 
streets running parallel to the Garden Grove Freeway, instead of adding lanes 
to the jam-packed freeway itself. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, the decision might be to relieve congestion by building 
extensions of the city's successful light-rail system, instead of new freeways, 
said Lee Hultgren, director of transportation for the San Diego Assn. of 
Governments. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan works, decisions like this all over the state will be made by 
Caltrans and by transportation planners for cities, counties and regional 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't design everything in Sacramento," Best said. "We need to have a 
program where state and local players come together to produce the best 
possible transportation plan. . . . We need to go beyond just cooperation (with 
local agencies) and have true integration." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that this would be a new and difficult role for Caltrans, which has 
a history of concentrating on highways and also has been accustomed to getting 
its way, more often than not, in disputes with local officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get rid of the turf-guarding and all of that," Best said. "And the 
way you do it is with money. . . . That's why the new revenue is so crucial." 
</P>
<P>
If Propositions 108 and 111 -- especially 111 -- fail, next year's Caltrans 
budget "will be a disaster," Best said. "Every unit in the department will be 
cut or frozen." 
</P>
<P>
The budget would be cut by at least $300 million in 1991-92, he said, because 
Caltrans would eliminate all outside contracting and would begin to trim its 
own engineering staff. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake retrofitting will continue, financed by the special quarter-cent 
increase in the state sales tax that Deukmejian and the Legislature approved 
after last October's Bay Area quake. 
</P>
<P>
Except for that, "basically, what we become is a maintenance and safety 
operation," said Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago, with little spending on anything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROP. 111: THE FINANCES 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 111 on the June ballot say billions of dollars would 
be generated for new transportation projects if the measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
Where the money would come from: 
</P>
<P>
1: $13 billion, over 10 years, from a 9-cent increase in the state gasoline tax 
and diesel fuel tax -- a 5-cent hike to take effect Aug. 1, 1990, with an 
additional 1-cent-per-gallon increase on Jan. 1 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
2: $2 billion from increased truck weight fees, for trucks over 4,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
3: $500 million from sales tax revenue that would result from the fuel tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
4: $3 billion from three separate general obligation bond issues for urban 
transit, commuter rail and intercity rail projects -- a $1-billion bond issue 
on June 5, 1990, another in November, 1992, and a third in November, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
How the money would be spent: 
</P>
<P>
$3.5 billion to complete projects the state Transportation Commission has 
approved but has no money to build. 
</P>
<P>
$3 billion for urban transit, commuter rail and intercity rail projects (if the 
three bond issues pass). 
</P>
<P>
$3 billion for "flexible congestion relief," which could include rail lines, 
busways, arterialstreet improvements, better traffic signal systems, bike paths 
and many other possibilities, as well as new roads. 
</P>
<P>
$3 billion in direct state payments to counties and cities for local road 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
$2 billion for state-local "partnerships"; this money can be used for a variety 
of transportation purposes but cities and counties would be required to pay 50% 
of the project cost. 
</P>
<P>
$1.25 billion for the Interregional Road System, connecting important economic 
centers in rural parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
$1 billion for "traffic system management" -- such things as ramp meters, 
computerized traffic signal systems and television surveillance of crowded 
highways and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
$1 billion for maintenance and rehabilitation of state highways. (This is in 
addition to the revenue being generated by the special quarter-cent state sales 
tax increase for earthquake repairs). 
</P>
<P>
$500 million for transit operations or construction. 
</P>
<P>
$150 million for sound walls. 
</P>
<P>
$100 million for freeway landscaping.

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: RONALD BELL, SON OF THE LAST MAN EXECUTED IN THE STATE, 
SAYS HE WANTS 'TO USE MY FATHER'S DEATH IN A POSITIVE WAY' AND ABOLISH THE

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald Bell's nightmares have not recurred in years. His period of mourning 
ended long ago. But he will be haunted always by the gruesome images of his 
father's death 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bell is the son of Aaron Mitchell, the last person executed in California, and 
he knows more than any son should about his father's death. An artist was there 
to sketch it. Reporters detailed the final gasps. What Bell doesn't know about 
his father's death, he can readily conjure. 
</P>
<P>
At age 39, Bell is two years older than his father was when he was walked, 
moaning, into San Quentin's gas chamber on April 12, 1967. Bell wasn't there, 
but he can imagine what it must have felt like to be strapped to a chair in the 
small steel chamber, waiting for cyanide pellets to fall into a basin of acid, 
creating the lethal gas. 
</P>
<P>
What strikes Bell as especially unfair about the death penalty is that a man 
isn't given "a fighting chance." As if envisioning himself inside the chamber, 
he said: "Let me run for it. Don't strap me in a chair and give me gas so I 
defecate all over myself, with a bunch of spectators who I can see watching me 
die." 
</P>
<P>
With California preparing to execute convicted killer Robert Alton Harris on 
April 3, memories of his father's final days flood back, and Bell is finding 
himself more determined than ever to pursue what has become his mission. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get involved in abolishing capital punishment nationwide, to try to 
use my father's death in a positive way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell came to that decision after 12 years as an actor in Los Angeles. He landed 
parts, mostly small ones, in television episodes, movies and theater 
productions. He also wrote a play about his father's final days and performed 
the part of his father in a production put on by the Inglewood Theater. 
</P>
<P>
But unable to strike it big, he returned to his hometown of Sacramento in 1987, 
with plans to attend UC Davis. He's been taking classes on and off since then. 
Eventually, he said he intends to go to law school, become a lawyer and defend 
death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by San Francisco defense attorney Robert Bryan, chairman of the 
National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, Bell is taking a role in the 
movement to end capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan met Bell as the lawyer researched Mitchell's case two years ago for an 
event sponsored by Amnesty International. Bryan asked Bell to put his acting to 
use by playing his father in mock trials in which Bryan and a prosecutor give 
closing arguments. In two trials so far, jurors picked from the audiences 
reached verdicts of life in prison, rather than death. 
</P>
<P>
"My father is dead," Bell said. "It is moot." 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a point to the exercise. "I want people to hear Aaron 
Mitchell's side of the story. . . . I want them to leave with a question mark: 
Was this man executed wrongfully? Was he rushed to the gas chamber?" 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's path to the gas chamber began on Feb. 15, 1963. A thief in need of 
money, he had spent the day drinking vodka and sawing off a shotgun. That 
night, he went to the Stadium Club, not far from his home, and robbed it of 
$321. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived as he was leaving. Mitchell disarmed one officer and using him 
as a shield, stepped outside. Officer Arnold Gamble, revolver drawn, was on the 
other side of the door. Guns blazed. Gamble died. Mitchell ran 2 1/2 blocks 
before collapsing. He had been shot seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written of the families of murder victims, how they never forget 
their losses. Such is the case with Gamble's family. His widow told The Times 
five years ago that the memories are so painful that she would not discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Gamble Jr., 14 when his father was killed, told The Times then that 
opponents of capital punishment don't understand the pain of the families of 
murder victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Have they ever known how painful it is? It's changed all of our lives, and 22 
years later, we're still changed. . . . The victims are the ones who are left. 
They can never get away from it," Gamble said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bell called the crime "stupid," and said his father "was a fool." 
But he also believes his father was executed because he was black and that he 
was the victim of racism. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1967," Bell said, "racism was rampant." Referring to his stepmother, he 
added: "The fact that my father was married to a white lady, a beautiful white 
lady, with flaming red hair, didn't help. He drove a white convertible 
Cadillac. He was just in the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
The execution is all the more bitter for Bell because it turned out to be the 
last in California. Courts in California and across the country, besieged by 
legal arguments against capital punishment, imposed a moratorium on executions 
shortly after Mitchell's death. And in 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down 
all death penalty laws. 
</P>
<P>
States quickly rewrote their capital punishment laws, and the Supreme Court 
held the new laws to be constitutional, starting in 1976. California 
reinstituted the death penalty in 1977, but lengthy and frequently successful 
appeals of the sentences have delayed its use. 
</P>
<P>
Bell vividly recalls his visits to San Quentin and the fatherly advice he got. 
" 'Be a lawyer. Get your dad out of prison. Don't do like me. Don't get caught 
up in this stealing and robbing.' He wanted me to be the complete opposite of 
what he was." 
</P>
<P>
Bell last visited his father on April 11, 1967, the day before the execution. 
Mitchell sang the spiritual, "Just a Closer Walk with Thee," so his mother, 
Virgie Mitchell, could hear his voice one last time. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave us an appeal, his final appeal, for us to hand-walk to the judge. And 
we did, me and my grandma," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
To the eyes of a 16-year-old, U.S. District Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli seemed to 
be sitting on a dais 15 or 20 feet high, like St. Peter deciding whether to 
open the gates to heaven. Zirpoli listened, went to his chambers and returned, 
denying the final appeal. 
</P>
<P>
After that final visit with his mother and son, Mitchell returned to Death Row 
and slashed himself with a razor blade. That night, with his execution looming 
the next morning, he picked at his wound and smeared blood on his palms. He 
then stood with his hands out as if he were on a crucifix. In capital 
punishment lore, the scene is infamous. Later, as he sat in the small octagonal 
gas chamber, he mouthed, "I am Jesus Christ" to his pastor, one of 50 witnesses 
who stood outside. 
</P>
<P>
Within the family, there are explanations for these actions. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bell: "His attorney said after the last appeal was turned down, 'The only 
way you're going to save yourself is to try to commit suicide or make them 
think that you're going to try to kill yourself. That will delay it and it will 
give you time to file some more papers.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Our background," Bell continued, "is a religious background. . . . The whole 
thing about, 'I am Jesus Christ,' it's a saying that a lot of people in our 
church use. 'I am Jesus Christ.' It's a way of making amends just before you 
die, hoping that God forgives you for any sin you committed in this life, and 
to accept you into his graces and into heaven." 
</P>
<P>
On the day of his father's execution, Bell went to his high school. 
</P>
<P>
"At about 10:20 that morning, my mom came and got me out of class, and said it 
was all over with, and she took me out of school and we went to my 
grandmother's house." There, the family had gathered to mourn privately. 
</P>
<P>
For a time afterward, Bell turned to crime. "I wanted to be like him then. But 
I was going to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Dolores Bell Lewis, was determined to do whatever she could to keep 
him from ending up like his father, so she moved the family from the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In their new neighborhood in Sacramento, people didn't know Bell as Aaron 
Mitchell's son. He turned to academics, sports and campus politics, becoming 
head of the black students association at his high school. Then the Army 
drafted him, despite his contention that he felt no patriotic obligation to a 
country that had executed his father. Rather than ship out for Vietnam, he went 
AWOL. 
</P>
<P>
After a stay in a stockade and a discharge, he returned to Sacramento and went 
to UC Davis, majoring in drama. He said he dropped out because he didn't 
believe there were parts of any dignity for blacks and headed for Hollywood. 
Along the way, he married twice and fathered six daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bell is calm and articulate when he talks about his father. But the 
execution left its mark. It is hard evidence of society's racism, he believes, 
and it's part of why he distrusts police. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel fortunate," he said, "that I have lived 39 years and never been beaten 
by the police." 
</P>
<P>
Family members say he bears a striking resemblance to his father. His 
grandmother, Mitchell's mother, forever is calling him "A.C.," Aaron Charles 
Mitchell's nickname. Sometimes, when money runs short, Bell said he has thought 
about the illegal ways of coming up with cash. 
</P>
<P>
But he is intent on proving to anyone who might wonder that the son is not like 
the father. "Aaron Mitchell stops me," he said. Besides, if he were to turn to 
crime, he would be letting down too many people. "I'm the only one in my family 
who has a chance of graduating from college," he said.

SENATE RACE AGAINST HILL LACKS SUPPORT, OPPONENT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last January, Democrat Janice Graham was rubbing her hands at the prospect of 
running against Republican Assemblyman Frank Hill in a special state Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
He is on the wrong side of the electorate in opposing abortion, she thought. 
And he has been targeted by the FBI's influence-peddling investigation in 
Sacramento at a time when public attention is focused on political ethics. 
</P>
<P>
In a race against Hill (R-Whittier), Graham predicted that state Democratic 
leaders and California abortion rights groups would mobilize volunteer forces 
for her and contribute thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Graham got her wish to run against Hill when they won their party nominations 
in a special primary election Feb. 5 to replace former state Sen. William 
Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights). But instead of being swamped by money and 
support, Graham has been frustrated by a lack of attention. 
</P>
<P>
She still feels she can win the April 10 election in a predominantly Republican 
district that runs from Laguna Beach in the south to Whittier and West Covina 
in the north. But her effort is going to be more lonely than she anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the state Democratic leadership, she wondered recently, "Why 
wouldn't they take the chance?" Robert Forsyth, a spokesman for Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), put it bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a race that would be very, very, very difficult for any Democrat to 
win because of the (Republican) nature of the registration and the voting in 
that district," he said. "Just as there are certain districts where it's (a) 
given that it is Democratic, there are also certain districts where it's a 
given that it's Republican." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the 31st Senate District is among the most Republican in California -- 
54% of its residents are registered with the GOP and 36% are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Graham also complained about the California Abortion Rights Action League, 
which worked for one of her GOP opponents in the open primary but has declined 
to support her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"They have created a division within the pro-choice ranks in Orange County," 
Graham said. "They tell me I don't have a chance to win and they only back 
winners." 
</P>
<P>
League spokesman Peter Scranton responded: "We only have so much time and money 
to spend. All the professionals seem to think that this one can't be won." 
</P>
<P>
Graham's campaign manager, Peter Remer, said the race was "tougher than we 
realized. Part of the problem is that Frank Hill is a sitting assemblyman and a 
lot of special interests are (reluctant) about going against him." 
</P>
<P>
Remer said, however, that Hill "can be beaten." He said Graham's campaign will 
target Democratic voters with a message that includes abortion rights and 
ethics. And he said it is significant that Hill won the primary with less than 
25% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that is one of the reasons he is running a full-scale campaign 
despite his favored status. Hill said he plans to spend $400,000. Graham said 
she has raised $34,000, but is broke. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest reason Graham was excited last January about a race against Hill is 
the FBI investigation. She expected that the corruption investigation would 
create a chance to seize a solid Republican seat from a weakened candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's Sacramento office was raided by the FBI more than a year ago as part of 
an undercover sting operation that has led to the conviction of former state 
Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) and the recent indictment of former state 
Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Norwalk). 
</P>
<P>
Hill denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged. But to keep the issue 
alive, Graham issued a scathing press release last week charging: "Mr. Hill has 
disgraced the . . . Legislature with his actions and he has clearly shown that 
his vote is for sale to the highest bidder. He has the ethics of a rattlesnake 
-- slippery and slimy and ready to bite." 
</P>
<P>
Sal Russo, Hill's campaign manager, said: "The American public is pretty good 
about recognizing that people are innocent until proven guilty." He said the 
important issues are "bread and butter. . . . They're crime and taxes and 
growth and development."

The winds of change sweeping Eastern Europe have finally reached the world's 
smallest republic, whose Communists -- 1,100 of them -- are preparing to change 
the name and politics of their party. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of the Republic of San Marino, believed to be the world's 
smallest legally recognized Marxist grouping, will discard its name and its red 
star, hammer and sickle logo at a party congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
The party of the tiny, landlocked republic in northern Italy, which represents 
29% of San Marino's 23,000 residents, probably will be called the Progressive 
Democratic Party, a social democratic grouping.

A federal judge today extended a restraining order against enforcement of the 
most restrictive U.S. abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
District Judge Alex Munson had issued a temporary restraining order Friday, a 
few hours after a group of Guam residents and medical groups filed a 
class-action suit. Today he extended the order until May 8, when a trial on the 
suit is scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers the life of the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
It makes it a third-degree felony to perform an abortion or aid in the 
procedure, a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or have an abortion and a 
misdemeanor for a person to solicit a woman to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The law is seen by abortion opponents as a potential vehicle to challenge the 
U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.

The body of a former state legislator abducted by Muslim separatists was found 
Sunday in Kashmir state, and an extremist group claimed that the politician had 
admitted to being a police informer and was hanged. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a patrol found the body of Mir Mustafa on a street in Batmaloo, an 
extremist hotbed in central Srinagar, a city 400 miles north of New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, police said separatists Saturday night shot and 
killed a Congress-I party leader and dumped his body outside his home in the 
Kashmir town of Pahalgam, about 60 miles east of Srinagar. The body of Ghulam 
Nabi Kullar was discovered Sunday morning, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Mustafa and Kullar were the latest victims of separatists who are engineering a 
popular uprising against Hindu-dominated Indian rule of the predominantly 
Muslim Kashmir state, police said.

LOCAL JAILS IN U.S. GROW MORE CROWDED

Although space in local jails rose 44% nationally between 1983 and 1988, an 
even larger surge in inmates cut average space for each prisoner by 6%, the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The increased jail space was outstripped by a 54% increase in inmates, leaving 
nearly 10% of the nation's 3,316 locally run jails under court orders to 
relieve crowding. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates in local jails in California averaged 43 square feet of space, compared 
to the 60 square feet adopted as a standard by the American Correctional Assn. 
California was one of nine states below the national average of 50.9 square 
feet per inmate, according to the bureau, an arm of the Justice Department. 
California also registered the highest average of inmates per jail housing unit 
-- 5.2. 
</P>
<P>
"The management of jail facilities becomes more difficult when more inmates are 
living in high density situations," the bureau noted in its report. 
"Maintaining high population densities in large segments of a jail can affect 
routine activities such as food service, visitation, recreation, medical care 
and sick call, inmate property management and inmates' movements to and from 
court or consultations with attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
From 1983 -- the year of the last previous jail census -- to 1988, the number 
of jail inmates increased from 223,551 to 343,569.

MAN WIELDING SHOTGUN KILLED BY SWAT TEAM

<P>
A man authorities said was mentally ill was shot and killed by members of a Los 
Angeles police SWAT team Sunday after he barricaded himself in a house with a 
sawed-off shotgun and allegedly threatened officers with the weapon, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old man, whose name was not released, was shot at 2:55 a.m. Sunday 
after the officers staked out his Southwest Los Angeles home for more than 
three hours, said Sgt. David Young. 
</P>
<P>
When SWAT team members approached a window near the home's bathroom, the man 
pointed the shotgun at them, Young said. The officers fired at the man, 
striking him several times in the chest and face. He was pronounced dead at the 
scene, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Police surrounded the house after responding to a report from a neighbor that 
the man had a sawed-off shotgun in his hand and "was shaking it in a 
particularly bizarre way," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the man had been suffering from schizophrenia and that doctors had 
prescribed him medication. But he had been off the medication when he was shot, 
Young said. "It was one of those cases that when he took his medication, he was 
OK," Young said. "But he would go for days at a time without taking his 
medication and he would freak out like this." 
</P>
<P>
Officers who saw the man inside the house had tried to talk him into coming 
out, but he refused.

2,000 MARK SLAYING OF ARCHBISHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years and a day after Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero was shot 
to death while celebrating Mass in his country, more than 2,000 people gathered 
Sunday on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall to commemorate his assassination 
and to protest U.S. presence in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Rally participants included members of at least 50 church, labor and student 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators railed at U.S. foreign spending, saying that in the last 10 
years, the country has sent more than $4 billion in military and economic aid 
to military-backed governments in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The assassination of Romero, an outspoken opponent of rightist death squads and 
military leadership, was blamed on a former El Salvadoran National Guard 
intelligence officer. Protesters said that because an arrest by 
government-controlled law enforcement agencies is not likely, the murder 
remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our own people funding this war (in El Salvador)," said Gladis 
Sibrian, of Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front-Democratic Revolutionary 
Front of El Salvador, the strongest of the leftist opposition groups, which the 
Salvadoran government has refused to recognize. "The fighting won't end and 
negotiations over how to run my country are not possible until the U.S. ceases 
funding the Salvadoran government."

CELLIST ABDUCTED FROM CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old UCLA student who plays cello in the El Camino College Symphony 
was abducted Sunday from the Gardena campus where she had gone for a rehearsal, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Marie Carlucci of Torrance was forced into her car in a parking lot on 
the campus at 16007 Crenshaw Blvd. and driven away by two men who appeared to 
be in their 20s, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said she is 5-feet-3, 120 pounds, 
with shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a 
knee-length blue dress, deputies said. Her car is a faded red 1985 Nissan 
Sentra two-door with California license plate number 1LRC307, said Deputy 
Rafael Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Don Carlucci, said she was to play the cello with the El Camino 
Symphony at 3 p.m. and then celebrate her 23rd birthday, which fell on Tuesday, 
with her family. 
</P>
<P>
Her father said she had just finished her junior year as an environmental 
geography student at UCLA and that she lives with a sister and a roommate. He 
described her as "on the quiet side, very intelligent and very likable and 
friendly." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been eight hours since she was abducted, you would think they would 
have located the car," a worried Carlucci added. 
</P>
<P>
One of the kidnapers was wearing a blue jacket, deputies said. Both abductors 
were described as being about 140 to 150 pounds.

RICHARD LILLARD; EDUCATOR, WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Lillard, an educator and writer with a lifelong devotion to the 
environment, has died in a Santa Monica hospital. The retired chairman of the 
English department at Cal State L.A. and award-winning historian was 80 and 
died March 19 of the complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles, Lillard was a prolific author who expressed in print his 
interests in Western history, fiction, the Nevada desert and his own home in 
Beverly Glen Canyon, a patch of verdant wilderness surrounded by the nation's 
second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
In "My Urban Wilderness in the Hollywood Hills," published in 1983, Lillard 
told of the mammals, reptiles and insects on the one-third acre that he 
lovingly tended; of the plants and trees, the swelling buds and the aphids that 
threatened them. 
</P>
<P>
"I both don't belong here and I do," he said of his then-36-year odyssey in the 
chaparral-covered hills. 
</P>
<P>
Lillard earned degrees at Stanford and the University of Montana before earning 
a doctorate in American civilization from the University of Iowa in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
He taught in Montana, Wyoming and Marysville, Calif., before joining the 
faculty of Los Angeles City College in 1933. He later taught at Indiana 
University and UCLA before moving to the Cal State English department in 1965, 
where he was chairman of the department from 1971 to 1974 before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to such books as "America in Fiction," "Desert Challenge," "The 
Great Forest," "American Life in Autobiography" and "Eden in Jeopardy: Man's 
Prodigal Meddling with the Environment," he became an adviser to naturalists 
and entomologists, a reviewer of countless books -- many of those reviews 
published in The Times -- and a contributor to dozens of magazines. 
</P>
<P>
His honors include Guggenheim and Fulbright awards and a fellowship from the 
Huntington Library in San Marino. Last May he was made a fellow of the 
Historical Society of Southern California for his historical and environmental 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently he had edited a yet-to-be-published work by G. Harold Powell: 
"Letters From the Orange Empire." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Louise, and two daughters. A memorial service is 
pending.

SCHOOLS TO CONSIDER CHANGES IN BUSING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: L.A. BOARD WILL TAKE UP REORGANIZATION OF PROGRAM THAT SENDS 
STUDENTS FROM OVERCROWDED MID-CITY CAMPUSES TO SUBURBAN AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a year of unprecedented enrollment growth in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, which sent waves of Mid-City children surging into 
suburban schools, the school board today will consider reorganizing its program 
for busing students to relieve overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
The district grew by more than 15,000 students this school year -- most of them 
in already overcrowded neighborhoods -- forcing its Capacity Adjustment Program 
to quickly find space for almost twice as many children as it handled the year 
before and wreaking havoc on some small suburban schools that suddenly had to 
absorb hundreds of new students. 
</P>
<P>
The students came in by the busload throughout the first several months of the 
school year last fall, forcing receiving schools to scrap carefully conceived 
classroom arrangements and scramble to find enough teachers, supplies and space 
for the new pupils. 
</P>
<P>
Those schools resembled "a (bus) terminal, where kids are getting bused in and 
out," said board member Mark Slavkin, sponsor of the motion to revamp the CAP 
to provide more predictability and stability at sending and receiving schools. 
</P>
<P>
His motion calls on district staff to find ways to channel more money to 
receiving schools for educational programs for new students; match up sending 
and receiving schools according to high school attendance area, so students can 
move through each grade level together; and reduce travel time for bused 
students, some of whom spend up to 2 1/2 hours on the bus each day. 
</P>
<P>
"The CAP program was set up years ago as a stopgap effort to deal with a couple 
of overcrowded schools," said Slavkin, who represents the Westside. "It's time 
we stop to take a look at what we're doing and try to reorganize it in a way 
that makes sense from an educational standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
The chaos that resulted from last year's unexpected enrollment surge led to a 
rash of complaints from parents, teachers and administrators at receiving 
schools, where there were too few bilingual teachers to handle the mostly 
Spanish-speaking newcomers and instructional materials were hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
Many schools had to reorganize several times last semester, breaking up 
classrooms and reassigning teachers to handle new students who seemed to just 
keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
At overcrowded sending schools, new students were squeezed into already-packed 
classrooms or held in auditoriums for weeks, while district officials searched 
for room in other schools and rearranged bus schedules and routes to get them 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"We were operating in a crisis mode, just trying to get them someplace," 
recalled board member Warren Furutani. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say they hope the program will run more smoothly next fall, in part 
because the district's overcrowding relief plan -- which requires more than 100 
schools to increase their capacity by 23% this year -- should create more space 
at both sending and receiving schools, making it easier to find seats for new 
students. 
</P>
<P>
The additional space could also be used to set up special language-assessment 
and instruction centers in receiving schools, where incoming CAP students could 
be tested and taught in their native language, if they were not proficient 
enough to keep up in an English-language class. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment process would allow receiving schools time to arrange for 
placement of the new students and the new bilingual classrooms would relieve 
much of the strain that resulted last year when thousands of students who spoke 
no English wound up languishing in English-only classes at their receiving 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the opportunity now at schools where there will be space to set aside 
two or three classrooms as a place where assessment would take place to see if 
the new student fits into an existing program in the school, and if not, we 
could offer full bilingual classes (in the centers)," said assistant 
superintendent Amelia McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
That model is predicated on the availability of bilingual teachers -- always in 
short supply in the district. But McKenna said a proposal to give receiver 
schools the same priority in the assignment of bilingual teachers that schools 
in predominantly Latino neighborhoods have -- coupled with a $5,000 incentive 
payment to bilingual teachers -- would help the district staff the new student 
centers, if the concept is approved by the board. 
</P>
<P>
The district has also made it easier for school principals to find bilingual 
classroom aides, by establishing a toll-free phone number linked to a computer 
bank of candidates. Last year, many receiver schools had trouble finding aides 
who spoke Spanish to help out in classrooms filled with Spanish-speaking 
youngsters and teachers who spoke only English. 
</P>
<P>
The board is likely to approve Slavkin's proposal today and ask its staff to 
come up with specific plans. But a final vote is probably months away and may 
follow protracted debate, as board members balance their competing interests -- 
making it easier for receiving schools to absorb the newcomers while lightening 
the burden on those students who must travel out of their neighborhoods to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 25,000 children are bused each day from their neighborhood schools to 
less-crowded campuses in the San Fernando Valley, South Bay and on the 
Westside, but space is rapidly disappearing in those schools as well. 
</P>
<P>
Union Elementary School near downtown Los Angeles had been sending the children 
it couldn't hold to Pacific Palisades Elementary, until last fall when that 
school filled up. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Wilbur Avenue in Tarzana had been selected as its next receiver, 
Union had collected more than 40 students to bus out, and that increased to 71 
by October. 
</P>
<P>
Each spring, district officials try to estimate how many students will have to 
be "capped" out of their overcrowded neighborhood schools the next fall, and 
designate receiver schools to bus them to. 
</P>
<P>
Extra teachers are sent to those schools from a special pool of more than 100 
instructors. They are assigned as few as 20 students per class, to leave room 
for new bused-in pupils. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, district officials were caught by surprise by the deluge of new 
students that never let up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The district's Capacity Adjustment Program began 10 years ago, busing a few 
thousand children from packed East Los Angeles schools, to relieve overcrowding 
that had been called one of the "ills of segregation" by the judge presiding 
over the district's desegregation case. Then, there was plenty of classroom 
space at schools a short bus ride away. But since then the district has grown 
dramatically and now nearly 25,000 of the district's 610,000 students have to 
be bused away from overcrowded schools.

1,200 NATURE LOVERS TAKE A HIKE TO PRESS CALL FOR MORE PARKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a thousand nature lovers -- including barefoot hippies, mounted 
cowboys and heavy-breathing runners, invaded the hills above Malibu on Sunday, 
hoping to persuade their leaders and neighbors of the need for more parkland 
near urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by a number of conservationist groups, including the Santa Monica 
Mountains Parkland Assn., supporters said the Los Angeles "March for Parks" was 
expected to be the largest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of other large cities staged similar walks nationwide Sunday to raise 
money for acquisition of parklands. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, nearly 1,200 people set off on the winding trails of Malibu Creek 
State Park seeking a brief respite from the hum and hustle of the crowded city 
before arriving at Paramount Ranch five miles away, where music and 
demonstrations awaited. 
</P>
<P>
The National Parks and Conservation Assn. also took the opportunity to recruit 
walkers and solicit money for its efforts to set aside more parkland. 
</P>
<P>
"This out here, in nature, is the real life on our planet. It doesn't exist in 
the frenzied, chaotic world of the city that we created," said Ronn Hayes, a 
Malibu conservation activist who was master of ceremonies for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the despair in the inner city, we need to make sure we have this land 
for people to re-touch nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the noontime sun burned gauzy fog off the rugged hilltops in Malibu Canyon, 
the dirt trails twisting through scrub oaks were alive with motion: horseback 
riders, speeding mountain bicycles and parents with strollers crisscrossed on a 
maze of trails. 
</P>
<P>
But even as cottontail rabbits dodged into the brush and bird watchers watched 
the creek bed hoping for a glimpse of a rare Eurasian widgeon, the business of 
the city was all to close at hand for some participants. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn!" gasped one man as he ran back toward the parking lot where the walk 
began. "My beeper just went off!" 
</P>
<P>
The meeting place between the urban and the wild was apparent as a group of 
horseback riders warned two boys on bicycles to slow down before racing behind 
the horses in a cloud of dust. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as people are ecologically concerned, I am all for having everybody 
come see this beautiful place," said Hidden Hills resident Ed Berliner, perched 
atop a patient paint horse. "It is nice to come out here without running into a 
lot of concrete and fences." 
</P>
<P>
For many, the lazy creeks and steep hillsides above Malibu reminded them that 
development is gradually swallowing much of the open space around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It is all being used up so fast. It's hard to see this land go down the 
tubes," said Malibu resident Douglas Rucker, listening to a folk singer after 
completing the five-mile walk. "Today is a celebration of the land, but it is 
also a funeral. I hope this makes people more aware of the value of this land."

NEW REGIONAL PARK TO MAKE ITS DEBUT ON SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two miles from the bustling Laguna Hills Mall, a red-shouldered hawk glided 
effortlessly toward a thick grove of gnarly oaks, towering sycamores and brushy 
elderberry trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that. Isn't it beautiful?" county Park Ranger Bruce Buchman called out 
last week, pointing to the bird soaring above the dirt path that winds through 
the picturesque Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years since the county completed acquisition of the 3,400-acre park, 
only a handful of rangers have been able to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
But that will end this week, when the public will get its first opportunity to 
visit the pristine canyons, creeks and crests tucked almost invisibly amid 
fast-developing Aliso Viejo, Laguna Niguel and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It does seem that the park is one of the county's best-kept secrets," said 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who will dedicate the newly opened 
wildlife preserve in a ceremony on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The public will be able to enter the park the following day. 
</P>
<P>
When open, Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park will be the second largest 
regional park in Orange County, surpassed only by the sprawling Ronald W. 
Caspers Wilderness Park in Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
At first, hikers, bicyclists and horse riders will be able to use the park only 
on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the Aliso Water Management Agency will be completing a 
construction project and trucks will stream through the area. Once the project 
is completed in six months or so, the park will be open daily, Buchman said. 
Admission will be free. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of trucks belonging to the water agency and park rangers, 
motorized vehicles, including motorcycles, will not be allowed in the 
wilderness park, and, for now, overnight camping and fires will also be 
prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Even bicyclists will face restrictions in the rangers' effort to keep the park 
as undisturbed as possible. Mountain bikers, who have been known to careen down 
rocky slopes and frighten or injure hikers, will not be able to ride on trails 
narrower than eight feet, Buchman said. 
</P>
<P>
Motorcyclists who have sneaked into the park in the past have left long gouges 
in the cliffs and canyons, and Buchman said it will take years for the scars to 
be completely healed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing what those guys can do in a half-hour," Buchman said as he 
conducted a tour of the park last week. "A motorcycle can cause a lot of 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
As the park develops, project manager Kathie Matsuyama said a few improvements 
will be made, including an educational nature center, a ranger station and a 
limited number of campgrounds, but for the most the landscape will be left 
undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is designed to be exceedingly passive, very natural," she said. "It is a 
very natural coastal canyon and has a nice population of flora and fauna." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are still working to categorize all the plant life that grows 
abundantly in the park's fields and marshes, and the Audubon Society has 
identified more than 90 species of birds living in the canyons. 
</P>
<P>
The area also supports coyotes, mule deer, perhaps a mountain lion or two, and 
a wide variety of other indigenous wildlife that used to roam freely through 
South County. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the area holds a storehouse of artifacts, and archeologists have 
been locating prehistoric campsites and collecting samples from the 
semi-nomadic Indians who once used the hundreds of natural caves in the park 
for protection from the elements. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologist Scott Crownover said that the canyon was once a natural border for 
the Juaneno and Gabrieleno Indians, two of the area's indigenous tribes. 
Several ancient campsites have been found in the area already, and there is the 
possibility that a village once thrived on the park's plains. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some major sites," Crownover said as he spent the day digging for 
shards of flint, burnt rock and other clues to the lifestyles of the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are the park's hidden treasures limited to Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, scientists have found hundreds of fossilized bones of fish and 
water mammals, including whales, that date back millions of years at the site, 
called Pecten Reef, Varner said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he added, the county owns the third largest collection of ancient 
marine artifacts in the country. To house those objects, county officials are 
considering building a 100,000-square-foot natural history and science museum 
at the Moulton Parkway entrance to the park, according to Dudley Varner, 
executive director of the Natural History and Science Foundation of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the artifacts already are on display at the museum's interim site in 
Newport Beach, a 7,000-square-foot facility. But, Varner said, a larger, 
permanent museum is needed because the bulk of the paleontological and 
archeological finds that have been turned up over the years are stored in a 
Santa Ana warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
For now, officials are concentrating on the park, where work began in 1988 
after the county received a large chunk of land from the Mission Viejo Co., 
which donated the property for the park as part of development agreements with 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
But several delays have postponed the park's unveiling. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, for instance, the parkland was the proposed site for a 
much-publicized national fitness center. Headed by former Los Angeles Rams 
coach George Allen, the center would have trained athletic instructors and 
housed fitness researchers. 
</P>
<P>
But Allen couldn't raise the money to open the center, and the county was 
forced to revise the general plan for the area, Matsuyama said. 
</P>
<P>
A general development plan, with a price tag of $1.8 million, is also being 
amended to reflect the county's inability to secure a right of way to build a 
bike path from the park to Aliso Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Landowner Violet Brown, who owns a restaurant and a golf course near Aliso 
Beach, refused to allow the bike path to cross her property, and county 
officials were forced to cut the bike path short and look for alternative 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
Another delay occurred when the county had to negotiate with the Aliso Water 
Management Agency, which owns an asphalt road that runs from Alicia Parkway to 
the agency's plant in Aliso Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The water agency has staunchly refused to allow bicycles or hikers on its road, 
and the county had to grade a new bike path parallel to the road, Buchman said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the park's general development plan is still not complete, county 
officials took the unusual step of opening it anyway, Buchman said. 
</P>
<P>
Buchman said that he expects the park to be even more popular than Caspers 
because of its proximity to populated areas and its rural nature. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really in the heart of South County," Buchman said. "But when you are 
out here, you can really get away from it all. Other than a few power lines, 
there is nothing out here but nature."

WORD 'EDUCATION' JOINING CITY LOGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's logo, which appears on all city vehicles, welcoming signs and 
stationary, is being modified by addition of the words "Education 1st." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David N. Ream said the change reflects the city's commitment to 
education and will play a role in the marketing of the Santa Ana 2000 Plan. 
</P>
<P>
That plan, approved last October at a joint meeting of the City Council and 
Rancho Santiago College Board of Trustees, includes after-school programs at 
all 29 city parks and offers scholarships to promising students. The plan is 
designed to tackle the problems of gangs, drugs, high dropout rates and 
inadequate child care. 
</P>
<P>
The original logo was designed in 1983 to promote business and investment 
opportunities offered in Santa Ana. Ream said the modification will now permit 
use of the logo to promote educational opportunities as well. 
</P>
<P>
Ream said it will cost the city about $10,000 to change all of the logos. The 
new version will be in place within six months. GREG HERNANDEZ

SCHOOL INFRACTION PENALTIES CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For students at El Modena High School in Orange, playing hooky used to mean 
spending a Saturday in detention hall. And if a student ditched the weekend 
punishment, he or she could be suspended for a day -- meaning that one truant 
day resulted in another day out of class. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, students who skip school are not punished with suspensions. 
Instead, they are given demerits that can shut them out of social events such 
as school dances and football, even graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"The premise is that the kids should be responsible for themselves," said El 
Modena Assistant Principal Walter Hess. "We give everybody 100 merits the first 
year they come here. From then on, any time you violate the rules . . . by 
excessive tardiness, truancy, disrupting class, you are assigned detentions." 
</P>
<P>
Each time a student fails to show up for his or her detention hour, he or she 
loses two merits. When a student slips below 90 merits, he or she is barred 
from attending social functions. If he or she falls below 86 merits, 
extra-curricular activities are out. And any student with less than 95 merits 
is not allowed to graduate until the marks have been made up. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started out, (the students) didn't think we were very serious 
about it -- not until the first big dance, when the ineligible students weren't 
allowed to buy tickets," Hess said. "We had a lot of shocked kids the first 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Students can earn back merits by volunteering time for teacher projects or 
cleaning up the campus. On average, about 30 students a day attend the 
detention sessions, and nine or 10 clean up the school grounds or work with 
teachers, Hess said. Currently, 172 out of the school's 1,710 students are 
either on social probation (below 90 merits) or ineligible for all 
extracurricular activities (below 86 merits). 
</P>
<P>
Although students who violate more serious school rules, including those 
against possession of drugs, alcohol or weapons, still face suspension or 
expulsion, Hess believes the program is accomplishing its goals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been pretty successful," he said. "We always have a number of students 
who could care less. . . . I think the people who it's hitting is the average 
Joe Q who just wants to graduate and leave." 
</P>
<P>
Hess pointed out that statistics from the first semester show Orange high 
schools averaged about 225 days of suspension per school. El Modena, however, 
had only 105 total days of suspension during the first semester. LAURA

AS SPACE STATION PREPARES TO GO UP, FEARS GROW ABOUT IT COMING DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
NASA: THE AGENCY SAYS FAILURE IS 'HIGHLY UNLIKELY.' BUT ENGINEERS ARE STUDYING 
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN 'UNPLANNED RE-ENTRY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When things go NASA's way, what goes up doesn't necessarily come back down. 
</P>
<P>
With scores of satellites uneventfully orbiting Earth, the space agency's track 
record is hard to assail. Yet when things go wrong, the failures can be 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
During the 77-ton Skylab's fiery plunge in 1979, there was massive 
hand-wringing around the world. Luckily, the debris fell harmlessly into the 
Indian Ocean and Australia's outback. 
</P>
<P>
But what if something three times the size of Skylab -- or roughly the size of 
the U.S. Capitol building -- were to experience, in NASA's words, an 
"accidental inadvertent re-entry"? 
</P>
<P>
That the much-touted space station, scheduled to be completed within 10 years, 
could fall from the sky, damaging property and taking lives, has largely been 
obscured by the public fascination with its futuristic design and unquestioned 
central role in U.S. space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Now two recent reports have served to spotlight that scenario, one that NASA 
says is utterly remote. 
</P>
<P>
But one prominent space scientist says that simple arithmetic -- based on 
NASA's own numbers -- shows that there is a strong likelihood, not just a 
possibility, that the 500-foot, 290-ton space station could run out of the fuel 
it needs to maintain orbit, thus falling back to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
NASA, in a recently released draft environmental impact statement on the space 
station, said specifically that the chances of the facility ever falling are 
"highly unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
It nevertheless candidly acknowledged that there could be two types of 
"unplanned re-entries" -- controlled and uncontrolled. 
</P>
<P>
In a controlled re-entry, NASA said, the space station could be steered on a 
course of descent that would minimize any "resulting footprint" -- in other 
words, away from population centers. 
</P>
<P>
But an out-of-control space station "could produce a debris footprint at a 
random location," NASA conceded. Its environmental impact statement left the 
rest to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The $30-billion project is considered the steppingstone to the exploration of 
the moon, Mars, the rest of the solar system and beyond. Its construction, not 
yet under way, is expected to take about five years. It will be 1995 at the 
earliest before the first components are launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom -- the largest spacecraft ever assembled -- is being designed to 
spend no less than 30 years in orbit 150 to 270 miles above Earth at 18,000 
m.p.h., circumnavigating it every 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the current designs are to be thoroughly re-examined because of emerging 
concerns among some NASA engineers, expressed in a recent interim report, that 
the space station's intricate components may require extensive repair and 
maintenance in outer space long before astronauts have it fully assembled. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers said the space station could be only 60% to 70% complete before 
space-walking astronauts may have to turn from assembling it to performing 
inspections, maintenance and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"With any long, strung-out process of assembly, you're running a risk of 
components breaking down," said Charles R. Price, a NASA engineer the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most difficult problems is to establish failure rate of components; 
that's predicting the future," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The potential flaws, involving solar power panels, various electronic devices 
and assorted structural components, also could require astronauts to spend 
dangerously large amounts of time working outside the space station, thus 
exposing themselves to excessive radiation and debris. 
</P>
<P>
NASA's environmental impact statement identified several possible causes for 
the space station or some of its components to plunge to Earth: 
</P>
<P>
* Failure of multiple and major on-board systems. 
</P>
<P>
* Collision with natural debris or with the space shuttle, which will ferry 
construction materials, astronauts and propellant fuel to the station. 
</P>
<P>
* Lack of sufficient propellant to stay in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Each scenario is "highly unlikely," NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from any structural damage or mechanical failures, the most likely 
cause of a space station plunge would be that it will run out of propellant, 
causing it to fall out of orbit, said John Pike, associate director for space 
policy at the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The space station is supposed to have sufficient fuel to maintain orbit for 180 
days, although current plans call for refueling every 73 days or so. 
</P>
<P>
But given such a large number of shuttle flights during the 30-year lifespan of 
the space station, Pike reasoned, another catastrophe like the 1986 Challenger 
explosion is inevitable -- a calculation based on NASA's own odds of such a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Another Challenger-like disaster, in turn, would lead to a prolonged grounding 
of all shuttles, thus making the refueling of the space station impossible, 
Pike said. He noted that on each of four occasions when the United States or 
the Soviet Union lost astronauts, manned spacecraft were grounded for more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
After the Challenger tragedy, the Department of Transportation asked NASA to 
assess the odds of a recurrence, and the space agency came up with a worst-case 
scenario of one explosion in every 78 launches and a best-case scenario of one 
in 200. 
</P>
<P>
Based on those projections, Pike said, "that would put it (the next accident) 
in the early next century." 
</P>
<P>
It would take 28 shuttle flights just to lift into orbit all the components of 
the space station. 
</P>
<P>
"Simple math is going to tell you that -- rather than extremely unlikely, as 
they describe it -- one would be surprisingly lucky if it didn't happen," Pike 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Hess, a NASA space station spokesman, warned against automatically 
assuming that the shuttle fleet would be grounded for extended time periods 
after another accident. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't necessarily follow," Hess said, adding that measures such as 
repositioning the space station or rearranging its solar panels could extend 
its orbital life by up to 200 more days. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, added Doyle McDonald, a NASA spacecraft engineer who directed the 
environmental impact statement, any precise calculations should be deferred 
until the space station's final design and configuration are known. 
</P>

<P>
NEW ENVIRONMENTAL CHIEF SETTLES IN WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the city's new "environmental administrator," deals with chemicals that have 
names 18 letters long. But in his first weeks on the job, he seems to have made 
progress in dealing with a far more intricate situation: Irvine politics. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in his first few weeks on the job, he has managed to find favor with 
at least two of the city's primary political forces -- no easy task in a city 
with an upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who championed passage of the city's new ordinance 
banning chloroflurocarbons, said he is impressed with Brown's record of 
scholarship and publication. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sure to put us in the lead as far as air quality and water quality," 
Agran predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Anne Sheridan, Agran's opponent in the mayoral election, said she voted 
against the ordinance because it seemed to be hastily implemented. But of 
Brown, she said: "He's terribly qualified . . . the program is one of educating 
the community. I think that's the role I see him in." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown, 37, talks about using diplomacy rather than politics to convince 
business leaders that complying with the new law does not necessarily mean 
losing money or complicating their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in being perceived as someone who walks around with a 
baseball bat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city passed the ordinance last year, affecting businesses that use or 
produce CFCs, Halon or other substances that are believed to contribute to the 
depletion of the earth's ozone layer. The ordinance covers the electronics 
industry, installers of insulation and the manufacturers of fast-food 
packaging. It is considered one of the most sweeping ordinances of its kind in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
At the time it passed, Brown was working in Massachusetts in the office of Safe 
Waste Management. Peter O'Neil, the director of information at the Department 
of Environmental Management in Boston, said that Brown bucked the theory that 
says environmental issues and business interests never coincide. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael has helped businesses to stay in business, be productive and not 
pollute the environment," O'Neil said. He cited Brown's work at Robbins Co. 
Inc., an Attleboro, Mass., jewelry firm that reduced its chemical use by 82% 
and its use of water from 500,000 gallons per week to 500. 
</P>
<P>
As he tried to settle into an office decorated with two plastic plants and an 
old flyer warning about the dangers of toxic waste, Brown described his new job 
as a continuation of his old one -- helping businesses make pollution laws 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the ordinance is very important because it says to the people of 
Irvine, of the nation and, indeed, the world: 'Look, we don't have to wait on 
this issue,' " he said. "I think this ordinance will show that the business 
community in Irvine can get a head-start on what's inevitable . . . I think 
everyone knows CFCs are going to disappear from commerce." 
</P>
<P>
Brown holds a master's degree and a doctorate from Cornell and a degree in 
politics from UC Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to conduct workshops, to tour plants and provide information to 
businesses for now. When the ordinance goes into effect in July, Brown plans to 
enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to be first," Brown said. "I think we can show it can be done."

<P>
CITY OPENS 24-HOUR INFORMATION LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Stanton has opened a telephone information line that gives 
residents a recorded schedule of events sponsored by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The line, which was installed last month, provides a three-minute recorded 
message containing City Council meeting schedules, the mayor's office hours, 
information on special-interest classes, such as courses on income tax 
preparation, and numbers for city offices. 
</P>
<P>
The message is updated every month. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to develop a device through which we could provide information to 
the community," said Terry Matz, the city manager. "We're providing a summary 
of information that we think people will need." 
</P>
<P>
Matz said members of the council last year suggested the city open an 
information line to keep residents better posted on upcoming events. He added: 
"This is a 24-hour service. We hope people will take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
The Information Line number is (714) 220-0500.

FISHERMEN TAKE CUES FROM DOLPHINS IN RARE PARTNERSHIP 
</P>

By KAREN PRYOR, This article was adapted from a paper published in Marine 
Mammal Science. The original paper was written by Karen Pryor, Jon Lindbergh, 
Scott Lindbergh and Raquel Milano. The four researchers visited Laguna during 
April, 1988, and February, 1989.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what may be a unique swapping of roles, a group of dolphins in a lagoon near 
the southern tip of Brazil seem to be leading the local fishermen in a highly 
successful cooperative fishing operation. 
</P>
<P>
Historical accounts, going back to Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79), offer repeated 
examples of joint dolphin-human efforts to trap mullet against beaches. In 
these accounts, ranging from the Mediterranean to North Africa to Australia, 
men on shore observe mullet traveling along the coast, too far to reach from 
land. If dolphins happen to be passing, the men shout, whistle or slap the 
water to attract the dolphins. If the dolphins then move toward shore, the 
mullet are trapped, and men scoop or spear them in the shallows. 
</P>
<P>
But these events, recorded centuries and continents apart, appear to have been 
sporadic, opportunistic and seasonal examples of joint predation, associated 
with the inshore movement of breeding mullet. 
</P>
<P>
Not so in the 143-year-old dolphin-human fishery at Laguna. A complex 
choreography has evolved in which the fishing is initiated and controlled by 
the dolphins. And as such, the behavior may be unique. 
</P>
<P>
The water at Laguna is extremely murky; visibility is less than a foot. The 
fishermen cannot see the fish and must depend on the dolphin's behavior to know 
when to cast their nets. The dolphins detect fish, round them up and deliver 
them to waiting fishermen near the shore. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing at Laguna occurs primarily on the shores of an inlet that extends 
from the ocean to a brackish lagoon near the center of town. Fishermen and 
townspeople said the fishing takes place all day, every day, except during bad 
weather, and all year except in the Southern Hemisphere winter months of July 
and August. 
</P>
<P>
According to town records, the unusual arrangement began in 1847. Some 
fishermen said their fathers and grandfathers fished with the dolphins, 
sometimes with the same individual animals, many of them recognizable by marks 
and scars. In at least one "family" of dolphins, three generations of 
recognized animals are now working in the fishery. 
</P>
<P>
While mullet are the main catch, other species taken include the Brazilian 
croaker and the black drum. The catch is sold in nearby markets, and the 
dolphin-associated fishery appears to be the primary source of income for about 
100 families. 
</P>
<P>
But this is strictly a business relationship. Like many joint ventures, there 
is mutual respect but no obvious friendship between the partners. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the enterprise usually works: 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen, each with a circular nylon throw-net rimmed with weights, 
position themselves in a single line, a net's diameter apart, in knee-deep 
water parallel to the shore. One or two dolphins station themselves several 
yards outside the line of men, facing seaward, floating or moving slowly at the 
surface. From time to time a dolphin submerges, usually moving seaward, and the 
men ready themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The dolphin reappears, usually in a few seconds, traveling toward the line of 
men. It comes to an abrupt halt and dives just out of net range, 15 or 20 feet 
from the line, making a surging roll at the surface that is quite different 
from normal respiratory surfacings. 
</P>
<P>
The men wait for the dolphin's signal and then cast their nets. Successful 
fishermen return to the beach to harvest their catch, and others replace them 
on the line. 
</P>
<P>
The timing and placement of the net cast are crucial because refolding the nets 
takes time and may cause a fisherman to miss a better opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Cues by the dolphins give the fishermen vital information. The timing of the 
roll indicates that fish are present; the direction of the dolphin's movement 
indicates the location of the fish, and the vigor of the movement appears to 
tell whether the school is large or small. 
</P>
<P>
And what's in this partnership for the dolphin? When the nets fall, the fish 
schools lose their rhythm and cohesion and become easy prey. Individual 
dolphins, including females with calves and at least one dolphin the fishermen 
said was more than 70 years old, can catch mullet with minimal effort. 
</P>
<P>
Successful fishing episodes are often followed by bouts of the dolphins' 
feeding behavior. They dart about rapidly under water, wave their flukes in the 
air and thrust their heads out of water, fish clenched in their jaws. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the human partners are profiting. In half an hour, a single dolphin 
can bring fish to the line six times. In a typical dolphin fish delivery, one 
or more fishermen will catch fish, typically 10 or more weighing up to 4 1/2 
pounds each. One man in a boat, working with a single dolphin, can catch more 
than 220 pounds of mullet in about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing appears to be initiated and controlled by the dolphins. Fishermen 
and their families often wait along the shore in hope of a dolphin's arrival, 
and the process does not begin until a dolphin decides to start work. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a working dolphin leaves the line of men and moves to another section 
of beach; immediately the men run through the water to re-form a line in the 
new site selected by the dolphin. One young male dolphin sometimes makes the 
men move repeatedly, apparently for sport. 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen do not call out, signal or attempt to affect the dolphins' 
behavior, which sets this activity apart from the informal man-dolphin 
interaction in other parts of the world where dolphins have been known to play 
or socialize with swimmers and boaters. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna fishermen do not think they train the dolphins. They never give them 
a fish. They do not attempt to touch them. Several fishermen said it is 
important not to distract the dolphins from their work. 
</P>
<P>
The participating animals have been named and recognized by many fishermen. 
Even animals without obvious marks or scars can be identified by fishermen at a 
distance of 160 feet or more. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins that are not in the partnership are called "bad" dolphins (ruim in 
Portuguese). The ruim may occasionally interfere with the fishing, typically by 
dispersing fish and by damaging nets. Dolphins in the partnership were reported 
by fishermen to be aggressive in defending the fishery. And the fishermen said 
they believe the "good" dolphins stay close to their work, being mostly 
resident in the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Although the human-dolphin cooperative fishing has long been part of daily life 
in Laguna, the situation is fragile. Tourism and increasing industry in the 
state of Santa Catarina are luring fishermen's sons into construction work and 
taxi-driving. 
</P>
<P>
Working dolphins have been drowned in commercial fishing nets offshore, and 
attempts to widen or deepen the lagoon entrance, to accommodate vessel traffic, 
might destroy the principal fishing beaches. Scientists hope to work with 
Brazilian environmental organizations to protect this unique example of human 
and animal cooperation.

SURGERY COULD HELP MORE EPILEPTICS, PANEL ADVISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Up to 5,000 epilepsy patients each year could benefit from surgery for their 
condition, a figure which is 10 times the number of those who currently undergo 
the procedure, a federal advisory panel said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent medical advances in epilepsy therapy, there are still may people 
who suffer from seizures that cannot be controlled by conventional 
anticonvulsant drugs. Many of these could be helped by surgery, said the panel, 
which was convened by the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by seizures that result from a 
malfunction in the brain's electrical system. The surgery involves removing the 
portion of abnormal brain tissue responsible for causing the seizures. 
</P>
<P>
"The operation has become safer and surgeons have become more adept" at 
identifying the precise location where the tissue should be removed, said Dr. 
Lewis P. Rowland, panel moderator and chairman of the department of neurology 
at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But he and other panel members emphasized that the surgery should be confined 
to those patients who do not respond to conventional drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they stressed, the surgery should only be performed in epilepsy centers 
"with multidisciplinary teams of specialists equipped to handle the complex 
preoperative, surgical and postoperative stages." 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of all Americans will have at least one seizure at some time, 
according to the panel, and 150,000 people each year will experience their 
first seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 150,000 each year who suffer their first seizure, about 10% to 20% will 
prove to have "medically intractable epilepsy," or epilepsy that does not 
respond to drugs, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of those with recurrent seizures can be controlled with 
anticonvulsant drugs, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel concluded that epilepsy patients whose seizures originate from one 
region in the brain are the most likely to be helped by surgery. However, they 
said, some patients with multiple seizure sites might also benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Although the surgery is accepted procedure, controlled clinical trials have 
never been performed. Also, there has been some disagreement among 
investigators about how to evaluate patients for surgery, which procedures 
should be done and which methods are best to assess surgical outcome. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there is no precise definition of "intractable epilepsy," Among 
the considerations are frequency of seizures, severity of the attacks and 
impact on the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
"If a patient falls during seizures that occur only a few times a year, 
repeated injuries and trips to emergency rooms can make life miserable," the 
panel said. "Even one seizure a year may disqualify a person from having a 
driver's license." 
</P>
<P>
The panel said that repeated seizures can also have adverse effects on the 
brain, leading to "progressive cerebral degeneration and more severe clinical 
handicap." Also, the group said, chronic use of drugs may cause toxic side 
effects and may also have adverse effects on learning, scholastic achievement, 
development and job performance. 
</P>
<P>
The largest group of surgical candidates includes those who suffer what are 
known as partial seizures in which the patient experiences some loss of 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Surgical success rates for these patients range from 55% to 70%, where success 
is defined as no seizures, with the risk of death and complications less than 
5%, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Deaths are very uncommon and injuries are also very uncommon," said Dr. Edward 
R. Laws Jr., chairman of the department of neurosurgery at George Washington 
University Medical Center. "It is practical now to do this kind of surgery with 
great precision and a reasonable degree of safety."

College women are using condoms more frequently in response to AIDS but their 
sexual behavior otherwise is unchanged from that of their 1970s predecessors, a 
campus survey indicated last week. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers in Rhode Island who queried 132 women students in 1989 found the 
same proportion had six or more lifetime sexual partners as had 486 women who 
were surveyed in 1975, before the epidemics of AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The women of the pre- and post-AIDS eras showed no differences in their 
willingness to engage in oral or anal sex or to have multiple partners, said 
Dr. Stephen Zinner, a professor of medicine at Brown University who helped 
conduct the survey. 
</P>
<P>
While he called the increase in condom use "encouraging," he noted that the 
proportion of women polled in 1989 who had their partners use condoms still was 
only 41%. 
</P>
<P>
"If less than 50% of the women in this educated college group use condoms, one 
would have to wonder what the proportion is in other groups," said Zinner. The 
study appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine.

USC scientists have found that a new drug called flumazenil can effectively 
reverse the effects of an overdose of Valium, Librium and related 
tranquilizers. Flumazenil also reverses the effect of the drugs when they are 
used as an anesthetic in surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Surgery patients were totally awake within minutes of receiving (it)," said 
anesthesiologist Stephen Steen. "You wouldn't know they had had anesthesia." 
</P>
<P>
In a study of 20 orthopedic surgery patients who received the drug and 10 who 
did not, Steen found that those who got flumazenil were significantly more 
alert at 5 minutes and 15 minutes after the surgery, he reported at a meeting 
of the Sixth World Conference on Emergency and Disaster Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great advantage to have patients awake so soon because you can far more 
easily assess if there are any problems medically, surgically, or with the 
anesthesia," he said.

WEST REGIONAL: THE LIONS' DREAM RUN THROUGH THE TOURNAMENT ENDS AS UNLV KEEPS 
PACE WITH THE FAST TEMPO TO WIN, 131-101.

<P>
Before Sunday's West Regional final, all of Nevada Las Vegas' starters 
approached Loyola Coach Paul Westhead, wished him luck and acknowledged his 
team's special journey through the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, players from both sides embraced at halfcourt. 
</P>
<P>
But for the 40 minutes in between of playing time, UNLV handed the Lions their 
most lopsided defeat of the season, ending their emotional quest with a 131-101 
victory to advance to the Final Four in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 14,298 at Oakland Coliseum Arena gave the Lions' Bo Kimble a 
standing ovation when he left the game for the last time in a Loyola uniform 
with 1:03 to play. But UNLV had effectively ended the game much earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In playing what Coach Jerry Tarkanian called their best game of the season, the 
Rebels dominated every aspect -- shooting (59% to 37%), rebounding (61-43) and 
playing a smothering defense that made it difficult for Kimble and Jeff Fryer 
to find shooting room. The Lions committed 24 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV happily agreed with Loyola's desire for a fast pace. Junior forward Stacey 
Augmon got the Rebels going early, scoring 25 of his 33 points before halftime, 
when they had a 67-47 lead. Augmon, who had 11 rebounds and helped hold Kimble 
to 14-of-32 shooting, was named the regional's most valuable player. Kimble had 
42 points. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV forward Larry Johnson finished with 20 points and 18 rebounds, and 
Anderson Hunt added 30 points and 13 assists, making four three-pointers. Point 
guard Greg Anthony had 21 points and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about a 10-point game if we played good," Tarkanian said. "I 
thought we played as well as we're capable of playing. We put together a great 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead, who said he considered UNLV a Final Four candidate when the teams 
played in November, said the Rebels "certainly deserve to be in the Final Four. 
We got the pace we wanted. Las Vegas was just the better team today. I think 
the pace helped them today." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV (33-5) will play Georgia Tech Saturday in the semifinals. Tarkanian is 
making his third appearance in the Final Four, having lost in 1977 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The early pace was scorching but it seemed to favor the Rebels, who pulled away 
from a 4-4 tie with a 12-0 run. UNLV took a 65-44 lead with a 13-2 run midway 
through the half and had a 63-second, 13-0 burst later. Augmon had 25 points by 
halftime and the Rebels were outrebounding Loyola, 30-19, while shooting 62%. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions mounted one threat before halftime, using two three-pointers from 
Kimble and another by Terrell Lowery. Kimble drew a standing ovation when he 
made a free throw left-handed, his tribute to the late Hank Gathers, and then 
made the second right-handed to pull Loyola within 41-37 with 5:22 to play in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
But Anthony made a three-pointer and a three-point play and Hunt got one of his 
five first-half steals in the 13-point burst that made the score 56-39. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble came out shooting three-pointers to open the second half -- he made 
eight of 11 in the game -- and Loyola pulled to 71-60 with 16:50 to play. 
Kimble scored 26 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lions' press failed to disrupt the UNLV attack, and the Rebels quickly 
rebuilt the lead as Hunt made three three-pointers in the next six minutes and 
Johnson began asserting himself inside. 
</P>
<P>
By the 12:25 mark, UNLV had a 94-72 lead, and when Kimble drew a technical foul 
with 10:22 to play, Hunt made the free throw for a 100-74 lead. The Lions were 
out of surges. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said that despite its 23 turnovers, UNLV successfully dodged the press 
early by having its big men pass over the defenders to Hunt up the middle, so 
he adjusted the press after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"We took more risks . . . but if you take more risks that means there's bigger 
gaps," Westhead said. "You either (force turnovers) and get back in the game, 
which I thought we almost did in the second half, or you open up the advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"So I think Hunt got us early and then our own excessive pressure got us late." 
</P>
<P>
Getting past the press meant easy shots for the Rebels. Augmon made 13 of 20, 
mostly on layups and short pullup jump shots. Anthony made eight of 10 shots, 
Johnson 10 of 14. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola could rarely find an opening. Fryer finished with 21 points but made 
only seven of 24 shots. Lowery was the only other Lion to score in double 
figures with 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we got back real fast and took away a lot of their transition game, 
which is really about 80% or 90% of their offense," Tarkanian said. "We had 
three things we had to do: We had to press, we had to score when we got the 
numbers and we had to get back fast to stop the transition. I thought we did 
all three." 
</P>
<P>
While UNLV continues on to Denver, the Lions returned to Los Angeles with their 
second-best record ever at 26-6. They can look back on their own final four -- 
their three tournament victories preceding Sunday's loss after Gathers' death, 
a period during which they received national attention. 
</P>
<P>
In the tournament, Loyola defeated New Mexico State, 111-92; defending champion 
Michigan, 149-115, and Alabama, 62-60. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said this was one time winning was secondary to him. "Today was the 
way the last three should have been, proof the last three were unexplainable," 
he said. "They were examples of the human spirit rising above occasions. But 
we're not angels, and we can't always rise above. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not devastated. When we entered this tournament I made the decision this 
wasn't for winning or losing, but to play hard for Hank. We were playing 
basketball on another level. It wasn't on the level of wins and losses. To play 
hard and care and do quality things, that's enough." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes fans -- and his own players -- recognize his team for its 
talent as well as for its emotional commitment in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I was fearful of, was the more you keep winning, the more you begin 
to think there's something special at work, there's a magic wand touching you," 
Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted it to seem that to get into this tournament this was a magical 
team that is blessed. We got in to play the best basketball we could." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions finished with an NCAA record 122.4-point average and a record 28 
games in triple figures. Kimble, who finished the season with a 35.7-point 
average to join Gathers as back-to-back national scoring champions, smiled when 
he left the court. He, Augmon and Johnson embraced and said they would see each 
other in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be remembered as a team that had heart and showed its love for 
Hank Gathers and basketball," Kimble said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, in a 30-point loss, that seemed enough.

I typed this first line left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Just a little gesture for a little basketball team from a little school down 
the lane. Bye, guys. Thanks for all the Loyola merriment. You lived, you died, 
you laughed, you cried. You got through the worst and gave it your best. 
Thanks, Paul, Bo, Jeff, Per, Tony, Terrell, Tom, Chris, everybody. Many a tear 
has to fall, but it's all in the game. 
</P>
<P>
As of tipoff Sunday, only five universities in America had shots at the 
national championship -- Arkansas, Duke, Georgia Tech, Nevada Las Vegas and a 
3,700-pupil, parochial institute in LAX's flight path that was known as "Los 
Angeles College" when the Jesuit fathers joined the faculty in 1911. Not too 
shabby, Loyola Marymount. There were 292 Division I schools with basketball 
teams. You made the final five. 
</P>
<P>
Just not, alas, the capital-F, registered-trademark Final Four. The knockout 
punch came Sunday, before 14,298 sympathetic witnesses at Oakland Coliseum 
Arena, when an NBA farm club from Nevada that opened Loyola's schedule came 
full circle to close it. The season's final final score, 131-101, leaves 
precious little room for complaint about bad calls or bad luck. The better side 
won. Viva Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions took it hard. Tom Peabody, the battle-scarred, bloody-kneed scrapper 
from Santa Ana who embodied this team's inexhaustible hustle, kept his upper 
lip stiff as long as he could. Finally, everything caught up with him. He broke 
down. Peabody felt the pang of what he and his teammates had been feeling all 
along, the private fears, the well-hidden secret. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been running scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Had the players convinced their ever-expanding audience that they had put the 
horror of Hank Gathers' sudden death behind them? Yes, they had. But it was all 
an act. A brave front. Their facade was cracked Sunday, when Paul Westhead 
second-guessed himself for not preparing his players properly, revealing that 
he simply couldn't bring himself to show them films of Loyola's season-opening 
game against UNLV because Gathers was in them. 
</P>
<P>
The coach thought about taking a team vote. His conscience balked even at that. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have made a technical mistake," Westhead said, wearing a look of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
If so, it was certainly a human mistake. 
</P>
<P>
And, if it means anything, no game film, no scouting report of any kind could 
have dramatically altered the course of this West Regional championship game, 
in which the Runnin' Rebels of Jerry Tarkanian just kept runnin' and runnin' 
and runnin'. The score was 16-4 before the referees got their whistles wet. 
Stacey Augmon, Anderson Hunt, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony, David Butler . . . 
Well, let's just say Las Vegas definitely plays five-stud poker. 
</P>
<P>
To lose to such a team is no disgrace. Loyola's Bo Kimble spoke of "going out 
with class," and risked doing otherwise only by drawing technical fouls in each 
of his last two games. This was hardly the Bo we had come to know. He, too, 
must have been having more trouble than was visible, keeping his private demons 
at bay. 
</P>
<P>
It was exactly three weeks ago Sunday that Gathers collapsed, and so much had 
happened since then. Emotions became askew, and we don't mean only those of the 
players. Others got carried away. "Experts" gave opinions on talk shows, 
proclaiming that Kimble had easily turned himself into an NBA lottery pick, 
that Jeff Fryer had surely shot his way into the draft's first round. Neither 
thing is necessarily true. Fryer can shoot, sure, but he might be fortunate to 
be drafted at all. Shooters of his size and speed are hardly uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a Loyola bandwagon that people climbed onto so much as it was a 
wish-upon-a-star. This was a little made-for-TV-movie of a story, one that 
touched a number of hearts. Loyola Marymount acquired the public sentiment of 
an orphanage. It was more than some happy-go-lucky little underdog. It was a 
basketball team distressed and depressed, showing courage, slaying giants. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas was not a villain here -- this wasn't one of those 
Catholics-vs.-convicts bits -- and warrants whatever further success comes its 
way. OK, so none of Tarkanian's players have yet been nominated for sainthood. 
Said Augmon, the junior from Pasadena who grew up nearer Loyola than most of 
the Lions did: "Remember, they called the Detroit Pistons bad boys, too." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble doesn't think of the Rebels as bad. He thinks of them as good. "Since 
you beat us, you'd better win it all now," Kimble told a couple of them at 
day's end. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount won just about everything else there was to win. Won games. 
Won respect. Won friends. The whole team should put the season to rest with a 
peaceful, easy feeling. Let somebody else run scared for a while. Let the Lions 
sleep tonight.

VINCENT PLAYS NO FAVORITES, BUT FAST BECOMES ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The funniest line ever written about a baseball commissioner came at the 
expense, predictably, of Bowie Kuhn, of whom it was said during the strike of 
1981, "This would never have happened if Bowie Kuhn had been alive today." 
</P>
<P>
The unspoken reference was to Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the hanging judge turned 
commissioner, who is generally credited with having whipped baseball into shape 
after the Black Sox gambling crisis, if in much the same way that Mussolini 
made the trains run on time. Kuhn couldn't whip a meringue pie into shape, much 
less George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
But no one is making jokes about the current officeholder, Fay Vincent, unless 
it's about his name. (David Letterman said that one of the clauses in the new 
labor agreement was that the commissioner, to avoid further embarrassment, 
would from now on be known as Vince.) Vincent was a visible figure in the 
recent negotiations between players and owners, playing the role of 
commissioner as most of us might envision it, which is to say not as an owners' 
toady, in the old style. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't end the lockout himself, but he loomed large, if only by making it 
clear that an impasse was unacceptable to him. In the process, Vincent 
presented himself as the game's conscience, publicly reminding both sides of 
their responsibilities to the paying public. 
</P>
<P>
And in the aftermath of that performance, Vincent could lay claim to previously 
uncharted territory, as a commissioner respected and maybe even embraced by 
players and owners alike. Most commissioners, it turns out, were not liked by 
either side. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, who visited the Baltimore Orioles camp in Sarasota, Fla., Saturday in 
the company of team owner Eli Jacobs, met the press and suggested that he 
didn't understand how a commissioner could avoid becoming involved. It's his 
job, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a commissioner can see baseball being hurt without making an 
effort to do something about it," Vincent was saying. "That's what I'm supposed 
to do. The question really becomes: What can you do that's useful? I tried. I 
like to think I was somewhat useful." 
</P>
<P>
In preparing for the negotiations, Vincent did a little more than just read the 
papers. He even went so far as to consult Marvin Miller, the former union chief 
who is, to most owners, only the devil incarnate. And since the strike ended, 
he has talked repeatedly about the necessity of both sides learning to trust 
the other. He said something remarkable Saturday -- that collusion by the 
owners during the last contract was at the heart of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The owners don't like to talk about collusion, which is not surprising. Most 
guilty parties are loath to discuss their crimes. But it was collusion that 
poisoned the atmosphere of the negotiations, and Vincent not only was quick to 
recognize it, but also was willing to say it aloud. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the single biggest problem in these negotiations was the background 
of collusion," Vincent said. "The element of distrust has got to be improved 
and corrected. Collusion was a very big reality in these negotiations. I think 
it made it difficult for players to trust the owners about the economic future 
of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The players don't trust the owners, but they're coming to trust the 
commissioner. If Vincent is what he appears to be -- an honest man -- then you 
have to wonder about some of his associations. He was once head of Columbia 
Studios, and now he's head of baseball. Integrity is not a word easily bandied 
about in either show biz or the baseball biz. But baseball may be an even 
tougher game. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, his studio did produce "Ishtar," but in Vincent's six months as 
commissioner, he has seen his first World Series interrupted by an earthquake 
and his first season delayed by labor troubles. And now the umpires are making 
his life just a little more miserable. 
</P>
<P>
But if baseball hasn't been so great to him, he has been OK for baseball. His 
predecessor, Bart Giamatti, died and has since been all but canonized as the 
scholar-commissioner who gave literary life to the game. But Giamatti was also 
known as a union buster when he was president at Yale. Who knows how well he 
might have handled the labor impasse? After Kuhn and before Giamatti was Peter 
Ueberroth, who largely took credit for everything that went right in baseball 
and blamed somebody else for everything that went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The new guy seems serious about his job. From all appearances, he's not running 
for governor or for sainthood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's one of the great responsibilities someone can have in life," 
Vincent said. "It's hard for me to think of anything that would be more 
wonderful, exciting and challenging to do than what I'm doing. When the game is 
afflicted, when there are major problems, I take it pretty seriously. 
Therefore, I was very relieved when we got it straightened out. I think it was 
a fitting resolution. I just wish we could have done it a month earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The problem now is next time, which no one wants to be like the past few times. 
Vincent says that there will be no collusion so long as he is commissioner, and 
he has plans to cement his relationship with union chief Donald Fehr. If 
Vincent can smooth the way for an agreement without a work stoppage when the 
contract ends in four years, he would secure a place in commissioner history, 
and without an accompanying laugh track.

SAMUEL STEPPING FRONT AND CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: IS HE A SECOND BASEMAN PLAYING THE OUTFIELD? OR AN OUTFIELDER WHO 
WILL EVENTUALLY PLAY SECOND BASE?

The black baseball gloves arrived earlier this week, wrapped in plastic. Juan 
Samuel picked them up, felt them, then shoved them into the bottom of his 
locker with a thunderous laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman's gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"I will play center field," Samuel pronounced. "Center field." 
</P>
<P>
If he does not convince you, it is because he has not yet convinced himself. 
But too late to back out and too early to plead failure, Juan Samuel has 
reached a personal warning track. There is nowhere else to go. There is nothing 
else he can be. 
</P>
<P>
And so today in Orlando, Fla., in the exhibition opener against the Minnesota 
Twins, he will take his place as the Dodger center fielder of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Or least, of the next month or so. 
</P>
<P>
Those focused on Samuel -- and that will be just about all of the Dodgers -- 
will see a player race across the grass like something out of a high-speed 
movie. They will see a player who can throw the ball as hard as a pitcher, only 
twice as far. But mostly, they will see questions. 
</P>
<P>
Can this two-time All-Star second baseman play center field when, two months 
ago, he said he didn't want to play center field? Can he play center field 
until some club officials get their way and trade for someone such as 
Philadelphia's Len Dykstra, returning Samuel to his original position? Can he 
play center field, period? 
</P>
<P>
How long does he expect to keep those black gloves hidden? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the best answer comes from Samuel's friend Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
"Juan is very happy to be a Dodger," he said. "And in this game, when you are 
happy somewhere, you'll do just about anything." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly a ringing endorsement, but the Dodgers knew they were taking a 
chance when they acquired Samuel last Dec. 20 from the Mets for Mike Marshall 
and Alejandro Pena. 
</P>
<P>
They knew Samuel was unhappy last season. He was converted to a center fielder 
by the Philadelphia Phillies because, he says, they wanted their local hero to 
play second base, and they offered him a multiyear contract not to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"I show I can play second base. I make All-Star teams, and guys who have played 
longer than me have not made All-Star teams," he said. "But they wanted to 
bring in Tommy Herr, who used to live in Delaware. Our general manager, Lee 
Thomas, and Manager Nick Leyva knew Herr from St. Louis and they wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally say, 'You give me a multiyear contract, I will do it.' And they did. 
So I couldn't say no." 
</P>
<P>
That two-year deal was worth $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
As he struggled in the outfield, learning to make catches he once thought 
impossible and over-the-head throws he thought unimaginable, the unthinkable 
happened. He forgot how to hit. His offense dropped and his pride was dented, 
and then, as if that wasn't enough, on June 18 he was traded to the contending 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"To be put in pressure situation when you are still learning a position, it was 
not fun," Samuel said. "It's not good for your head." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention your statistics. By the end of the year he was hitting just .235 
with 11 homers and 48 runs batted in, all career lows. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers knew all this. So why the trade? Some will say because they were so 
desperate for a center fielder, they would have traded for anybody who could 
spell it. Others will say it was because second baseman Willie Randolph will be 
36 and without a contract when the season ends, and that Samuel, 29, would be a 
good replacement if he can survive this summer. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the best explanation is, they made the deal because of The Manny 
Mota Show. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have never heard of it haven't been in front of a television set in 
the Dominican Republic on Saturday mornings from 11:30 a.m. to noon. Although 
Mota is admittedly no Carson -- he does no monologue -- the Dodger instructor 
hosts a weekly sports talk show with a variety of guests, including a recent 
appearance by Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his guests are so big, Mota turns their appearance into a two-part 
series. Last winter, Samuel was one of those guests. During a Wednesday 
afternoon taping, Mota asked him what teams he would like to play for. Samuel 
mentioned the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Samuel had arrived home from the studio, his phone was ringing. He 
had just been traded to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he wanted to come here," said Mota, who has become Samuel's personal 
instructor. "And being such a great, great athlete, we knew we could work with 
him. We knew that if he wanted to be with us, we could make him a great center 
fielder." 
</P>
<P>
"I was very happy with the trade," Samuel said. "The only thing was, we had to 
go back and re-tape the show." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers took advantage of that happiness a couple of days after the deal 
when Manager Tom Lasorda took Samuel to dinner and casually broke the news that 
he would not be moving back to second base. In true Lasorda fashion, he said 
something like, how would you like to be the greatest center fielder in 
baseball history? 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Well, if that's what you want, I am willing,' " Samuel recalled. "I 
want to play for the Dodgers. I like the weather. I like the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
He then showed them how much by working as a center fielder three days a week 
with Mota at a local university, chasing fly balls, working on throws, 
practicing footwork. Mota would schedule a 9:15 a.m. workout, but he said it 
would not be surprising if Samuel arrived 45 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Manny made everything so easy, I could not wait to get to work," Samuel said. 
"Also, I get up early because of a baby in the house." 
</P>
<P>
That work has continued this spring, with Samuel and Mota often together in the 
outfield during batting practice and later. The Dodgers are reassured by his 
work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't find the switch to be too hard," said Bob Bailor, a former 
Dodger who made the transition from second base to the outfield in triple-A in 
1974. In 11 ensuing major league seasons he played 425 games in the outfield 
and 419 in the middle infield. 
</P>
<P>
"Center field is actually easier than the infield," said Bailor, manager of 
Toronto's triple-A Syracuse club. "You have the batter right in front of you, 
you can stretch your arm out on throws, you have a lot of room to run. And you 
have less responsibility than second base." 
</P>
<P>
The job, according to Samuel, still has its drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Such as predictability: "The ball does all kinds of crazy stuff out there!" 
Samuel exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
And endurance: "I get tired just running back and forth to the position," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unknown whether, a couple of months into the season, Samuel will 
succumb to what he perceives as the biggest drawback: That center field is not 
second base. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Samuel said, laughing. "Ask me in June."

DODGER NOTEBOOK;

GRIFFIN BEGINS TO COMPLAIN OF SHARP PAINS IN HIS BACK

<P>
The Dodgers' injury problems, once confined to any number of outfielders, are 
moving closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Alfredo Griffin has begun complaining of sharp pain in his back, a 
pain which he says is worse than the shoulder and hand pain he has endured 
through the past few seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"If the pain is steady, and I know what it is going to be, I can handle it," he 
said. "But this pain, you don't know when it is going to come, and how bad it 
is going to be. And if I finally can't take it, we will have to figure 
something out." 
</P>
<P>
Said therapist Pat Screnar: "He does have stiffness, but he is able to do all 
the work, and it seems to be getting better." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin confirmed his back has been examined, and no problems have been found. 
</P>
<P>
"I will keep playing for as long as I can stand it," said Griffin, 33. He will 
miss today's opening exhibition game against Minnesota. Lenny Harris is 
scheduled as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin won't be the only projected opening day starter left behind. Kal 
Daniels, Willie Randolph, Jeff Hamilton and Mike Scioscia also will not make 
the trip to Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The probable starting lineup will be Rick Dempsey at catcher, Eddie Murray at 
first base, Mike Sharperson at second base, Harris at shortstop, Dave Hansen at 
third, Hubie Brooks in right field, Juan Samuel in center field, and Chris 
Gwynn, Jose Gonzalez or John Shelby in left. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson took batting practice off a tee for the first time since inflaming 
his knee by taking 150 swings last Tuesday. He took just 50 swings and said he 
felt good. "The main thing we're working on now is his hands," said Ben Hines, 
whose skills as one of baseball's best hitting instructors will be needed this 
season as he works with several hitters coming off injuries -- Gibson, Daniels, 
Gwynn and Franklin Stubbs. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Don Aase joined the pregame meeting for the first time, another hint 
that he will be one of three extra players with the Dodgers for the first three 
weeks of the season. He will go to Orlando along with two other contenders for 
the extra spots, pitchers Steve Davis and Mike Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
An NCAA basketball championship could mess up the Dodgers' pitching rotation. 
Mike Morgan, who will probably begin the season as one of six starters, claimed 
he has told the Dodgers that he will return to his hometown and ride in the 
UNLV victory parade April 3 if the Rebels win. That may be a joke, but Morgan's 
intentions are serious. His family still lives in Las Vegas, and he has been 
attending UNLV games since age 3. "I've waited many, many years for this," 
Morgan said with a smile while walking through the clubhouse wearing a hat 
shaped like a shark. "I will not be denied."

"I think everybody is well aware that time is of the essence and we need to 
derive as much from the competition as possible," Angel Manager Doug Rader said 
on Sunday after his team played an intrasquad game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not making evaluations based on intrasquad games and exercises. That's 
irresponsible. The way we compete over the next 14 games is important. More 
needs to be made of these games to get in the proper mind-set." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston is scheduled to pitch the first three innings today, with Mike 
Witt set to pitch the next three. Bryan Harvey, Scott Bailes and Bob McClure 
will finish. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield will rest today because of a minor hamstring pull that 
has not completely healed. 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, Johnny Ray didn't start the intrasquad game after he was hit 
in the head twice in Saturday's simulated game, but he played later and 
pronounced himself fit. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Dan Grunhard, who played at double-A Midland last season, and 
infielder Kent Anderson each had three hits in Sunday's intrasquad game. "The 
Grunhard boy did a nice job," Rader said. "It was nice to see all the kids do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Grunhard is among six non-roster players who joined the team for the trip to 
Yuma. Also taken along were former Phillie third baseman Rick Schu, outfielders 
Reed Peters and Ruben Amaro, Jr., pitcher Mark Eichhorn and infielder Donnie 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn, who pitched for the Atlanta Braves last season and was signed as a 
free agent in December, gave up three runs in his first inning Sunday, but 
Rader was not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very impressed with the guy," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are trying to persuade the Padres to use a designated hitter for 
their series. The Angels might have more of an argument next week, when the 
teams meet again for four games at the Angels' park in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitchers haven't taken batting practice, and they're not likely to get 
any. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd take it (today) at the plate," Rader said. "It's going to be 'Go hit.' 
That's it."

VERSATILE DONNIE HILL HAS A PLACE ON THE ROSTER CLEARLY IN HIS SIGHT

<P>
He can hit from either side of the plate, throw with either hand and play 
second, shortstop or third. With all the things Donnie Hill can do for the 
Angels, it's easy to overlook the two he won't do. 
</P>
<P>
One is play first base. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little short for that," said Hill, who is generously listed on the 
Angels' roster at 5-feet-11. "Maybe when I grow up." 
</P>
<P>
The other thing he isn't likely to do is discuss the eye ailment that 
threatened to curtail his career. An infection that developed in 1987, 
apparently caused by his contact lenses, didn't disappear until he was fitted 
with disposable lenses, which are discarded before bacteria build up on them 
and infect the wearer's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Free of discomfort and distorted vision, Hill has shown enough eagerness and 
versatility in training camp to virtually assure himself of a spot on the 
Angels' roster. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid can play three infield positions and switch hit. There's not too many 
of those around," Manager Doug Rader said of Hill, who was signed as a free 
agent in January and came to camp as a non-roster player. "If he remains 
healthy, he remains in our plans. The only thing that could get in the way is 
his eye problem." 
</P>
<P>
Eye problem? What eye problem? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no eye problem," said Hill, who was born in Pomona and graduated from 
Edison High in Huntington Beach. "It's completely gone now. It affected my 
vision, but it's cleared up and my eyes are fine." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 29, was signed by the Oakland Athletics in 1981 and came up through their 
farm system as a shortstop. He was supposed to start the 1985 season in double 
A, but was moved to second when Tony Phillips was injured during spring 
training. Hill batted .285 that season, with three home runs and 48 runs batted 
in, and hit .283 the next season as the regular second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Hill was traded to the White Sox in December of 1986 and opened 1987 as their 
second baseman, but he was put on the disabled list because of his eye ailment 
early in the season. He returned to the disabled list in July and August 
because of a hamstring injury and platooned at second for most of 1988, when 
his average fell to a career-low .217. 
</P>
<P>
He was released by the White Sox last March, but the A's signed him to a 
triple-A contract with their Tacoma affiliate. He hit .261 in 58 games, but was 
released by Oakland last August. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who was familiar to Rader because of Rader's stint as a coach and interim 
manager in Chicago, is determined to make the most of his ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to camp ready to do everything I could to make the club," said Hill, 
who played second, shortstop and third during Sunday's intrasquad game. "I was 
kind of worried during the lockout, but things have worked out OK so far. I 
look at this as getting another chance to prove I can play." 
</P>
<P>
If he can give second baseman Johnny Ray, shortstop Dick Schofield or third 
baseman Jack Howell an occasional rest without the Angels losing anything in 
the field, he would fit Rader's ideal of stockpiling versatile players. Rader 
has already said he will try second baseman Mark McLemore at third and 
shortstop, and Kent Anderson played some at second and third last season, in 
addition to the 65 games he started at shortstop. Bobby Rose can also play 
second or third. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming so versatile wasn't Hill's original plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland moved me to second in '85, but I really didn't think much about 
playing other positions until then," he said. "As time has gone on, especially 
if you're not starting, it helps to be able to play other positions. I started 
at third in Chicago a little bit, so basically I have quite a bit of time in at 
all three. Normally, I'd say I prefer second base, but I'm comfortable at all 
the rest. Wherever he (Rader) sticks me, I'll just try to do the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels open a four-game exhibition series against the Padres today in Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston is scheduled to pitch the first three innings for the Angels 
today, with Mike Witt set to go the next three. Bryan Harvey, Scott Bailes and 
Bob McClure will finish up. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield will be rested today because of a minor hamstring pull that has not 
fully healed. Ray didn't start Sunday's intrasquad game as a precaution after 
he was hit in the head twice Saturday during a simulated game, but he played 
later and pronounced himself fit. Chili Davis was limited to being the 
designated hitter Sunday because of minor leg tenderness, but Rader said the 
problem is not serious. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Dan Grunhard, who played at double-A Midland, Tex., last season, and 
Anderson each had three hits Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Grunhard boy did a nice job," Rader said. "It was nice to see all the kids 
do well." 
</P>
<P>
Grunhard is among six non-roster players who joined the club for the trip to 
Yuma. Also going were Hill, former Philadelphia third baseman Rick Schu and 
reliever Mark Eichhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn, who pitched for Atlanta last season after several successful years 
with Toronto, was signed as a free agent last December. He gave up three runs 
in his first inning Sunday but Rader was not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very impressed with the guy," Rader said. "He needs to throw forkballs 
consistently. The first few pitches he threw were fastballs. As soon as he 
started throwing forkballs and breaking balls, he started getting people out." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are trying to persuade the Padres to use the designated hitter for 
this series. The Angels' pitchers haven't taken batting practice, and they're 
not likely to get any. "They'd take it (today) at the plate. It's going to be 
'Go hit.' That's it," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Bert Blyleven was elected the Angels' player representative this 
season, replacing Witt. "I've been there before," said Blyleven, who was the 
player representative for the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Claudell Washington worked out at first base in one of the two 
simulated games the Angels played Saturday. He enjoyed it, but not enough to 
make a habit of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I played first base for 30 minutes. I know my career is up," Washington said 
with a mock grimace. "If they had put me over there when I had reflexes, I 
might have had a better chance."

<P>
Jerry Tarkanian locked the locker-room door and told his basketball players 
three things before Sunday's NCAA West Regional title game against Loyola 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"Number 1: I'm going to the Final Four," the Nevada Las Vegas coach began, 
definitely getting their attention. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian waited a beat and added: "You can either go with me or you can watch 
it on TV, it's up to you." 
</P>
<P>
That was for inspiration. The next point was an instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Number 2: No talkin' trash," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Loyola players had pointed out that in their last game with UNLV, the 
Runnin' Rebels had run off their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Chris Knight, elaborating, had said: "Other teams, like a Michigan, 
will yell: 'Where's your jump shot?' But Vegas is like: 'Where's your mother? I 
think she's in my room.' They're such good players -- why do it?" 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the UNLV players played like gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
The third tip from their coach was sound advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Play hard, all day long," Tarkanian told them. "No matter what the score is, 
keep coming hard. These Loyola guys don't quit." 
</P>
<P>
Ahead early, 16-4, UNLV suddenly found itself in a tight contest, 41-37, after 
Bo Kimble's first left-handed free throw and a right-handed one that followed. 
Taking their coach's advice, the Rebels kept playing hard, and won, 131-101, 
never trailing from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian had said the day before the game that Loyola was the only team he 
would concede was better conditioned than the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday, he retracted. 
</P>
<P>
"I changed my mind. I think we're in better shape than they are." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Stacey Augmon led UNLV with 33 points, but guard Anderson Hunt was the 
runningest Rebel, scoring 30 points while steering the fast break and handing 
out 13 assists. He also had six steals and only two turnovers in 34 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"(Loyola) said we'd need oxygen," Hunt said. "They said we couldn't run with 
them. But it was the type of game we dream about." 
</P>
<P>
This is UNLV's third trip to the Final Four. In 1977, the Rebels lost to North 
Carolina in a semifinal game. In 1987, they lost in the semifinals to Indiana, 
the eventual NCAA champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we legitimately have a better chance of winning than in 1977 and 
1987," Tarkanian said. "I think there isn't anyone we can't beat if we play 
well." 
</P>
<P>
With one hour of practice to prepare to play Loyola, UNLV spent 30 minutes 
working on the press. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the Rebels' success against it was an adjustment that put 6-10 
center David Butler in the middle to receive the inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's height allowed him to see over the press, and for the Rebels' quicker 
players to get downcourt and take advantage of the broken court. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV also was effective at slowing the Loyola break, sending Greg Anthony and 
Augmon downcourt quickly and wide enough to guard against the three-pointer by 
Jeff Fryer or Bo Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a 30-point loss, Loyola Marymount Coach Paul Westhead got a kick out of 
the way the game ended -- on a three-pointer by reserve center Marcellus Lee, a 
6-foot-10 senior who had just entered the game. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, a point guard at heart who enjoys attempting three-point shots, connected 
from the right corner with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Westhead said when he addressed the team in the locker room, 
"Believe it or not we had a nice laugh. . . How about Marcellus? We got the 
last one. I am really happy for the guys. I was so happy for Marcellus because 
we're not really in it for the wins and losses. That was a great way to go 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble finished the season with 1,131 points, the sixth-best total in Division 
I history. The only other players to top the 1,100 mark are Pete Maravich of 
Louisiana State (three times), Elvin Hayes of Houston, Frank Selvy of Furman, 
Hersey Hawkins of Bradley and Austin Carr of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
In winning the national scoring title with a 35.7 average, Kimble gave Loyola 
back-to-back leaders. The late Hank Gathers won it last season. The only other 
school with back-to-back scoring champs is Furman, where Selvy led the nation 
in 1953 and 1954, and Darrell Floyd led in 1955 and 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Jeff Fryer broke the NCAA tournament record for three-point field 
goals and attempts. Although he was four of 16 Sunday, Fryer finished the 
regional with 38 successes, breaking the record of 35 set last season by 
Michigan's Glen Rice. His 97 attempts also established a record. 
</P>
<P>
Also, from the free-throw line, Fryer was perfect, 18 for 18. 
</P>
<P>
Erasing a mark that held up for a quarter-century, Nevada Las Vegas' 131 points 
set a record for points in a regional final. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, in a 109-69 rout of Providence, the old record was set by a team with 
a style seldom confused with UNLV's -- Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
Marcellus Lee's last-second three-pointer put Loyola past the 100-point barrier 
for the 28th time this season, another NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we got one laugh today, thanks to Marcellus," Coach Paul Westhead 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With the game long ago decided, Westhead generated most of the excitement in 
the last 10 minutes by drawing a technical foul with 4:12 to play, screaming at 
two officials. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV was ahead at the time, 119-86, but Westhead said it wasn't the frustration 
of the score or the emotions of the last three weeks at work. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly was working the game," he said. "I knew I wouldn't be working it 
tomorrow so I worked it today. I wasn't gonna fold my arms and hope the minutes 
fly away." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Alan Drooz and Robyn Norwood also contributed to this 
story.

SAVARD LIFTS BLACKHAWKS TO 3-2 WIN, 3-POINT LEAD 
</P>

<P>
Denis Savard scored the go-ahead goal, then shared the credit. 
</P>
<P>
Savard's 27th goal with 4:39 remaining lifted Chicago to a 3-2 victory over the 
Detroit Red Wings Sunday at Chicago and gave the Blackhawks a three-point lead 
in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
"(Steve) Larmer knocked (Bernie) Federko off the puck after going behind the 
net, and got it to (Michel) Goulet," Savard said. "It shows how much teamwork 
pays off, especially down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Goulet took the puck away from Mike O'Connell and passed to Savard for the 
game-winner, giving the Blackhawks 84 points to 81 for the idle St. Louis 
Blues. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in only his third game since being released from the federal medical 
center at Rochester, Minn., Bob Probert tied the score, 2-2, at 2:06 of the 
final period. 
</P>
<P>
It was Probert's third goal in three games. His status is day-to-day, 
determined on an individual game basis by his probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Steve Yzerman scored his 60th goal. 
</P>
<P>
N.Y. Rangers 7, Philadelphia 3 -- Kelly Kisio and Mike Gartner each scored two 
goals as the Rangers moved to within two points of their first division title 
in 48 years by beating the Flyers at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Rangers 83 points, their highest total since 1983-84, and 
left them seven points ahead of the New Jersey Devils. The Rangers can clinch 
their first division title since 1941-42 Tuesday night with a victory in 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The loss kept the Flyers tied for fifth place in the Patrick Division with the 
New York Islanders, two points out of a playoff spot. It was Philadelphia's 
38th defeat this season, tying a team mark set in 1971-72, the last time the 
Flyers failed to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
New York led, 2-1, after one period before putting the game away on 
second-period goals by Kisio, Gartner and Troy Mallette. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 4, Buffalo 3 -- John MacLean scored his 40th goal of the season and 
Peter Stastny had two assists as the Devils clinched a playoff berth by downing 
the Sabres at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat snapped a two-game winning streak for the Sabres, who remained five 
points behind first-place Boston and one point ahead of third-place Montreal in 
the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey, which retained its three-point lead over third-place Washington in 
the Patrick Division, had a 4-1 lead and held on after Dave Snuggerud and Dave 
Andreychuk scored 4:17 apart midway through the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, Calgary 1 -- Alan May scored the go-ahead goal in the third 
period on a pass from Geoff Courtnall, who also had two goals as the Capitals 
beat the Flames at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Washington opened a four-point gap on Philadelphia and the New York Islanders 
for the final Patrick Division playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's Al MacInnis scored at 5:19 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, Winnipeg 3 -- Petri Skriko and Paul Reinhart scored third-period 
shorthanded goals within a 23-second span and Brian Bradley tied the score with 
1:26 left in regulation as the Canucks rallied to tie the Jets at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets built their 3-0 lead on first-period goals by Moe Mantha and Brent 
Ashton, plus a second-period score from Paul Fenton. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg moved to within four points of second-place Edmonton in the Smythe 
Division, with three games left for each team. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- Mike Tomlak scored the game-winning goal at 14:11 
of the second period and Pat Verbeek added his 44th of the season as the 
Whalers beat the Penguins at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh remained in fourth place in the Patrick Division despite a 1-7-2 
slide since March 6. The Penguins lead Philadelphia and the New York Islanders 
by two points for the final playoff spot.

PADILLA BREAKS U.S. RECORD, BUT NO WORLD BEST

All Doug Padilla was trying to do Sunday in the Carlsbad 5,000 men's elite race 
was stay in contention. Nothing more, nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty simple strategy, really. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to match whatever move anybody made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What he did was come up with a few moves nobody else made and win in 13:29.50, 
an American 5,000-meter road race record. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla came in just ahead of Mexico's Ignacio Fragoso (13:31) and Kenya's 
Barnaba Korir (13:37). 
</P>
<P>
Elly Van Hulst of Holland won the women's elite race in 15:32.50. PattiSue 
Plumer was second in 15:35 and Annette Peters next in 15:36. 
</P>
<P>
There were an estimated 35,000 spectators. Padilla and Van Hulst each won 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
There were no world bests, noteworthy because of the race's history. The men's 
winner has set a world standard in three of the past four years. Two of those 
were by Steve Scott, who was 10th Sunday. Padilla surpassed Scott's American 
mark of 13:30.2. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real high point," Padilla said. "This is by far the most prestigious 
5K in the world. To come here and have a good race would be great, but to have 
a good race and get the American record is fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, 33, lives in Orem, Utah. He completed his eligibility at Brigham Young 
University in 1981 and got a degree in electrical engineering from there in 
1983. He holds the American track record at 3,000 meters, two miles (indoors) 
and 5,000 meters (indoors). He has run well in 1990, winning the indoor track 
circuit's grand prix, after a rough spell last year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he wasn't sure how he would fare in Carlsbad. He has asthma, and spring 
isn't normally a very good time for that. And, he wasn't happy with his 
performance in Carlsbad last year -- he was so far back in the pack that he 
doesn't even know where he finished. Finally, his wife gave birth to his third 
child two weeks ago, so he hasn't gotten much sleep lately. 
</P>
<P>
He took the lead about 1 1/4 miles into the race and, while never running away, 
fended off the others. 
</P>
<P>
As Padilla approached the two-mile mark, 12 runners were bunched up in a tight 
lead pack. The leaders crossed the two-mile mark in 8:51. Two-and-a-half miles 
in, six runners remained in the lead pack -- but Padilla was ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I could always hear footsteps," he said. "Two guys came up with me and the 
second turnaround (Carlsbad Blvd./Mountain View Dr.) and I had to push to stay 
up. Down the home stretch, Fragoso was right there." 
</P>
<P>
The second turn-around, though, was crucial. There are two on the course, and 
both are hairpin turns, much tighter than what Padilla is used to on a track. 
</P>
<P>
"One difference is, you can get boxed in on either side in a road race," he 
said. "If you're in the second or third lane on a track, you're never going to 
get boxed in. Last year, I bet I lost 30 yards on the first turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
Once he successfully navigated the second turn Sunday, it was just a question 
of hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
"I could feel that I was starting to get tired. My legs were getting tight 
during the last 400 meters. I could see the finish wasn't very far away. I was 
just hoping to get there before my legs fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem Van Hulst faced in the women's race was at the start. The 
elite men and women ran at the same time, and one of the men got tangled up in 
the crowd at the start and fell in Van Hulst's path. 
</P>
<P>
"I jumped over him," Van Hulst said. "I was just hoping I didn't fall. I think 
I was on the wrong side. I started on the left side. Next year, I'll stay on 
the right side." 
</P>
<P>
Van Hulst, who won the 3,000-meter race at the European Indoor Championships 
and holds the world record for that distance at 8:33, also had to contend with 
a pack, albeit smaller, in the women's race. She, Plumer and Peters were close 
the entire way.

NEWSWIRE: HOCKEY PLAYERS FIGHT WITH FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The coach and two players of a minor league hockey team were suspended Sunday 
as the result of a 20-minute brawl between players and fans during a game 
Saturday night at the Seattle Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The stick-swinging free-for-all erupted during the third period of the Seattle 
Thunderbirds' 9-2 victory over the Tri-City Americans in the opener of a 
best-of-nine, first-round Western Hockey League series before 12,075. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Shaw, president of the league's board of directors, said Americans Coach 
Rick Kozuback and Tri-Cities players Terry Virtue and Jeff Fancy were suspended 
indefinitely after officials reviewed the incident. Seattle took a 2-0 lead in 
the series with a 6-2 victory on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The ruckus came shortly after a fight on the ice between Darcy Simon of the 
Thunderbirds and Greg Spenrath of the Americans. A dozen police officers 
struggled to restore order as fans and players swung wildly at each other with 
hockey sticks. Five fans were ejected and four others were arrested. Police 
officer Gary Arnold's mouth was cut during the brawl.

<P>
Defending Formula One champion Alain Prost hopes his victory Sunday in the 
Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo will help his Ferrari team become more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Prost, a newcomer to the team, beat the favored McLaren-Honda team for his 
first victory in only two races since switching to Ferrari. The Frenchman, 
starting sixth, left McLaren-Honda at the end of last year after a season of 
acrimony involving Brazilian teammate Ayrton Senna. 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Berger of Austria, who replaced Prost at McLaren-Honda, started and 
finished second, just ahead of pole-sitter Senna. 
</P>
<P>
"The race proved that the car is very good and very quick," said Prost, the 
Formula One leader with 40 career victories. "I hope we will fight the whole 
year with the McLarens. They still have a small advantage with the engine, and 
we have the advantage with the chassis." 
</P>
<P>
The race, the second of the Formula One season, essentially was decided when 
Senna crashed on the 39th of 71 laps at the 2.7-mile Jose Carlos Pace race 
track. Senna tried to sneak inside Satoru Nakajima on a curve, but the Japanese 
driver blocked the way, knocking off Senna's front spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
Prost and Berger passed, while Senna went to the pits to change his spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
"I went way out to avoid Nakajima and it looked like I had an open track, but 
he suddenly came back toward me," Senna said. "I hit the brake, swerved right 
to move away from him, but his right rear tire took my nose off." 
</P>
<P>
Senna began a desperate attempt to recover, but the new front spoiler didn't 
fit right and kept him from giving serious chase to Prost and Berger. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, who set the track record with a lap of 1:19.899, said mechanical and 
physical problems prevented his catching Prost. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought at one point I had a chance to catch him, but I had a big pain in my 
foot and noise from the clutch," he said. "I also had a problem with smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Prost averaged 117.59 m.p.h. in a race that took 1 hour 37 minutes 21.258 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Nigel Mansell of England finished fourth in the second Ferrari. Belgium's 
Thierry Boutsen was fifth, a lap down in a Williams-Renault, followed by 
Brazilian Nelson Piquet in a Benetton-Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Prost, a three-time Formula One champion, nine points after 
two races. Senna, who won the opening event at Phoenix, leads with 13. 
</P>
<P>
McLaren-Honda has 19 points to 12 for Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Rainey raced into the lead from pole position and held off all 
challengers to win the 500cc Japan motorcycling Grand Prix at Suzuka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But his Yamaha teammate and four-time world champion, Eddie Lawson of Upland, 
retired after spilling on the fifth lap. 
</P>
<P>
Rainey, 29, of Downey, second overall last year behind Lawson, completed the 22 
laps of the 5.86-kilometer (3.66-mile) Suzuka circuit in 48 minutes 52.475 
seconds in sunny but windy weather. 
</P>
<P>
Rainey, second at Suzuka last year, won the first grand prix of the season at 
an average speed of 98.346 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Wayne Gardner, the 1987 world champion, finished second in 
48:55.712. American Kevin Schwantz, winner of the two previous 500cc grand prix 
at Suzuka, was third in 49:08.031. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, the 1989 world champion, fell victim to Michael Doohan of Australia, 
whose Honda skidded and slammed into Lawson from behind when Lawson, in fourth 
place, was jockeying for position in a tight pack of top riders. 
</P>
<P>
He was thrown off and, despite a soft landing in the track-side sand, sustained 
a slight injury to his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Houston of Hickory, N.C., took the lead on lap 43 and kept it in the 
Mountain Dew 400 NASCAR Busch Grand National series race at Hickory Speedway in 
Hickory, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, driving a Buick, started third in the 30-car field. But he quickly 
moved into second place and then around pole-sitter Chuck Bown about 
one-quarter of the way through the 200-lap event. 
</P>
<P>
Houston won $10,205 for his second consecutive victory in the series. His 
average speed was 74.631 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Ellis of Richmond, Va., came from the 19th starting position to finish 
second, five seconds behind Houston. Bown, of Portland, Ore., was third, 
followed by Robert Pressley of Asheville, N.C., and Bobby Labonte of Corpus 
Christi, Tex.

A Master Teacher 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken has been taking time out from preparing his legal defense and 
running a new company to impart some mathematical wisdom to elementary school 
students. Since September, Milken, the former junk bond wizard at Drexel 
Burnham Lambert, has appeared every two weeks to teach sixth-graders at the 
elementary school run by his synagogue, the Stephen S. Wise Temple in Bel-Air. 
He has taught similar classes at other schools. In class, Milken so far has 
shunned the more arcane areas of his expertise, such as calculating junk bond 
yields -- or underwriting fees. 
</P>
<P>
But the classes, described by school officials as extremely popular, do give 
some insight into his own mathematical prowess. Much of his instruction 
involves tricks for doing swift calculations mentally, such as shortcuts for 
doing multiplication without the aid of pencil or calculator. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Howard, the math teacher whose classes he speaks to, says he has also 
taught some rudimentary trading skills, including a unit on bartering that 
required students to imagine that they were stranded on an island and had to 
trade different kinds of scarce food. 
</P>
<P>
Although Milken is under indictment on racketeering and securities fraud 
charges, Metuka Benjamin, director of education at the temple, says she has 
heard no complaints from congregation members about the classes. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin says Milken is teaching for free. 
</P>
<P>
(Milken is contesting the criminal charges.) 
</P>

Schussing Briefcases 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard proves that it is not only strong in the computer field but on 
the ski slopes, as well. For the third year in a row, the Palo Alto company has 
come in first in the Corporate Ski Challenge at Alpine Meadows at Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Harrah's came in second place in the 10-year-old event, which now attracts 75 
corporations, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric was third. Other participating 
companies included Chevron, AT&amp;T and Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
"Corporations are acquiescing to the industrial psychologists' very vocal pleas 
to blend health and fitness with workloads and participating in this event is 
one way of doing it," says Dan Nourse, director of communications at Alpine 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Goodman, a vice president at Digital, puts it another way: "It gives us a 
chance to do something past the usual bonuses and expected benefits." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Time -- at Least Once? 
</P>
<P>
If you hate airline delays -- and who doesn't? -- here's a tip to use when 
you're booking your next flight. In addition to asking your travel agent about 
the cost, arrival and departure times or the availability of your favorite 
seat, also ask about that flight's on-time record. 
</P>
<P>
Few travelers, even the most seasoned, know that such information is available 
for the asking. The key is found in the flight code that appears in airline and 
travel agent computers. 
</P>
<P>
A last digit of "1" means that particular flight has landed on time 10% to 20% 
of the time for the past month, "2" for 20% and 30% on-time arrivals, and so on 
up to a 90% to 100% on-time record. 
</P>
<P>
The data comes from the reports that airlines are required to file each month 
with the government and does not include delays caused by mechanical problems.

MAVERICK ECONOMIST TREADING NEW TERRITORY; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: PAUL KRUGMAN'S MIXTURE OF ANALYSIS AND ICONOCLASTIC VIEWS IS GAINING 
GROWING RESPECT IN ACADEMIA AND AMONG POLICY-MAKERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the rare economist who wins acclaim in both academia and the public arena. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most influential thinkers in the field, such as Robert Lucas of the 
University of Chicago or Franco Modigliani of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, are barely known by important policy-makers and the public at large 
because much of their work is incomprehensible. But popular writers on 
economics, such as MIT's liberal Lester Thurow, Harvard's retired John Kenneth 
Galbraith or free-market evangelist George Gilder, are usually dismissed by 
their colleagues as shallow researchers who pander to fashionable tastes to 
reach the best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
But now one of the most respected young academic economists in the country is 
making a bid for a wider audience with an unusual book that attempts to build a 
bridge between the obscurantism of the research world and the practical 
concerns of policy-makers and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Age of Diminished Expectations: U.S. Economic Policy in the 1990s," 
Paul Krugman, a 37-year-old wunderkind at MIT and a member of the Los Angeles 
Times' Board of Economists, has drawn on some of the most sophisticated 
analysis in the field to try to make sense of the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably an impossible task. But Krugman, in challenging some of the 
conventional wisdom of his own profession as well as public misconceptions, may 
well be charting a new course for others in his field. Krugman's effort marks 
the beginning of a new series of expensive, issue-oriented books by Washington 
Post Co., which owns the Post newspaper as well as Newsweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Serious economics needs a bridge to the world of policy discussion," said 
Robert M. Solow, a prominent MIT economist, "because the people who do the 
research either cannot or will not build the bridge themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his own sterling credentials, Krugman is unsparing in pointing out 
where economists fall short themselves. For example, he explains that 
researchers don't really know why there has been so little gain in the nation's 
productivity -- the output per worker that is ultimately responsible for a 
rising standard of living -- since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"There are, as always, a number of theories, but these amount to little more 
than sophisticated cocktail party chatter," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
"Ignorance of the causes of the problem, though, has never prevented people 
from proposing cures," Krugman adds. "The orthodox economist's prescription, 
for example, is simple: Suffer. Consume less now so that more resources are 
available for investment in plant and equipment or education. You may live 
worse today, but in 10 years -- or is it 20? -- our productivity will be 
sufficiently higher to make up for your sacrifices." 
</P>
<P>
On shakier ground, Krugman also challenges the almost universal belief among 
economists that a U.S. trade war with Japan and Europe would be an unmitigated 
disaster. He contends that the economic costs of erecting a high tariff wall 
around North America would not be much worse than a modest 1% increase in 
unemployment. His analysis, however, seems to ignore the adverse financial 
market reaction that might lead to a far more devastating outcome. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Krugman is wrong on that point, his unique mixture of rigorous 
analysis and iconoclastic views is nonetheless attracting growing respect both 
inside and outside the ivy-covered walls of academic economics. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he does not belong to a particular school or have a specific ideological 
bias," said Rimmer DeVries, chief economist at J. P. Morgan in New York, "he 
always has fresh or novel ideas." And Paul Samuelson, the Nobel Prize winner 
whose textbook has been the most popular college introduction to macroeconomics 
for years, said: "Paul Krugman is a rising star among economists. He is 
informed and sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Krugman's basic question is compelling. Why have Americans been so willing to 
accept the mediocre performance of the U.S. economy over the past two decades? 
In 1967, for example, futurist Herman Kahn published a book in which some of 
the best thinkers of the time expected productivity growth to reach as high as 
4% a year, with 2.5% annual gains considered the most pessimistic view. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine confronting these forecasters with a nation where productivity crept 
up by little more than 1% a year, where real hourly wages fell through the 
1970s and 1980s, where poverty grew in absolute terms. . . . Yet that is the 
economy we've had," Krugman writes, "the economy with which we begin the final 
decade of the 20th Century, and it surely has produced no political upheaval. 
On the contrary, the remarkable fact is that our economic performance today is 
broadly considered a success." 
</P>
<P>
For answers, Krugman looks at several policy problems, such as the budget 
deficit, inflation and monetary policy, trade protectionism and the U.S. 
confusion over how to approach the economic challenge from Japan. He also 
examines the S&amp;L scandal, Third World debt and the explosion of corporate 
takeovers in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The uncomfortable conclusion, in nearly all cases, is that the public and our 
political system is generally content to let problems drift, in large part 
because such a course is so much easier to follow than dealing with any 
disruptions that might flow from any of the alternatives.

Shooting "bio-bullets" at diseased big horn sheep wasn't exactly what Fred Paul 
envisioned when he began tinkering with a new idea for BB guns. 
</P>
<P>
As a researcher for 3M Co., Paul was experimenting with a "safe-shooting" 
water-filled BB when he casually splattered a shot on his office wall. 
"Suddenly it hit me. What I had wasn't a gun. It was a long-range delivery 
device." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years and more than $8 million later, Paul's privately owned 
Ballistivet Inc. is arming ranchers and wildlife veterinarians with guns that 
shoot soluble bullets packed with freeze-dried vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
His aim is to have bio-bullets dominate syringes in the $1-billion vaccine 
sector of the animal health industry. The company also is targeting the 
$4-billion market of antibiotics, wormers, fertility drugs and other 
pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real Buck Rogers deal. It's goofy," said Dr. Jerry Swanson, 
veterinarian for Hitch Enterprises, a 160,000-head feed lot business in 
Oklahoma and Kansas. "But it's really taking off. Pretty soon, every cowboy in 
the high plains will have one of these guns sticking out of his truck window." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the company has only 14 employees, controls less than 1% of the animal 
vaccine market and isn't expected to make a profit until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul, who extracted the technology from 3M in 1983, expects sales to triple 
this year to about 3 million bio-bullets. In addition, the company is moving to 
a new plant capable of making up to 100 million doses a year. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson said the bio-bullet has distinguished itself by adding speed, comfort, 
dosage uniformity and sterility to the vaccination process. The units, fired 
rapidly from up to 50 feet away, penetrate flank muscles and dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, Swanson said, bio-bullets spare cattle the stress of syringe 
inoculations since heavy handling can disrupt a bovine's eating habits for up 
to three days. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Jessup, wildlife veterinarian for the California Fish and Game 
Department in Rancho Cordova, said the patented invention has vastly improved 
the fight against a pneumonia-producing virus killing large numbers of lambs in 
a herd of big horn sheep ranging the Santa Rosa Mountains near Sacramento. "For 
us this is a godsend," Jessup said. "Any alternative to having to catch animals 
is quite useful." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Eis, project manager of bio-production development at rival SmithKline 
Beecham Animal Health Products in Omaha, Neb., said bio-bullets are a 
well-crafted alternative to syringes when used on wild or unpenned animals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to revolutionize the market, and I don't think you are ever 
going to replace the syringe," Eis said. "But it is quite quick and quite easy, 
and there is a niche in the market for that." 
</P>
<P>
In western Wyoming, game wardens are aiming bio-bullets at a herd of 22,000 elk 
to vaccinate against brucellosis, a bacterial disease that kills unborn elk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest wildlife disease program in North America," said Tom Thorne 
of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. "The Ballistivet gun is kind of the 
linchpin to the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
The system also has been used on wild game in Africa and South America, but its 
biggest moneymaking potential is in the domestic 110-million beef cattle 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Paul and Ballistivet President Donald Sturtevant wouldn't disclose sales 
projections, but their product now sells for 47 to 53 cents apiece, about four 
times as much as syringe doses. 
</P>
<P>
Paul said 3M invested $2 million to $3 million to develop bio-bullets but 
decided in 1983 that they didn't fit with its business. Instead of killing the 
project, 3M accepted royalties from Paul, who raised $500,000 in a private 
stock offering to form Ballistivet. A year later he kept the company alive by 
taking out a second mortgage on his hobby farm. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the company has raised $6 million in private stock sales and has 
avoided sizable bank debt. It is marketing the product through distributors who 
handle other veterinary products.

Traffic School Argues Against Change: An attorney for a traffic school that 
employs comedians to teach safe driving argued Thursday in Los Angeles Superior 
Court that a new Department of Motor Vehicles policy would harm the schools and 
the public. 
</P>

The school, Comedians Plus Learn From Us, sued the DMV over a proposed policy 
to list the schools by their state license numbers rather than by name. Judge

U.S.-BUILT CAR, TRUCK SALES DECLINE 9.5%

<P>
Sales of North American-built cars and trucks tumbled 9.5% in mid-March 
compared to a weak period last year as the absence of big rebates, especially 
on trucks, showed its effect, auto makers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The nine major auto makers with U.S. plants said they sold cars and trucks at 
an average daily rate of 35,497 during March 11-20 this year, compared to a 
rate of 39,225 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales slipped 8.9% while truck sales were down 10.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The slide in truck sales, which make up 38% of all vehicles sold in the United 
States, may end soon. On Thursday, General Motors Corp., for the first time, 
offered $1,000 rebates on its three-vehicle line of front-wheel-drive minivans. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. already was offering a $500 rebate on its Aerostar minivan. 
</P>
<P>
When Chrysler Corp. offered incentives on its market-leading minivans in late 
December and January, sales soared. But since the incentives expired, sales 
have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler led the decline in mid-March sales with a 29.9% drop in car sales and 
a 23.3% decline in truck sales, combining for a 26.6% overall sales skid. 
</P>
<P>
"The minivan incentives probably created a lot of sales for them but pulled 
sales from March," said auto analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; 
Co. of New York.

CAARP Sues Commissioner: The California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan filed 
suit against state Insurance Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie on Tuesday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court seeking a court order overturning Gillespie's December, 
1989, denial of a rate increase for the plan, which provides the minimum auto 
liability coverage to drivers who are unable to purchase it in the private 
sector. CAARP appealed Gillespie's 1989 decision to the California Supreme 
Court, which declined to hear the case. (Filed March 20 1990; Case No. C755745)

Unocal to Sell Norwegian Unit: Unocal Corp. said it would sell its Norwegian 
oil and gas subsidiary to a unit of Paris-based Total CFP, a French oil 
company, for $322 million. The sale of Unocal Norge A/S to Total Marine Norsk 
A/S includes Unocal's 18% interest in the Veslefrikk oil field in the North 
Sea, Unocal spokesman Michael Thacher said in Los Angeles. The sale, which is 
subject to Norwegian government approval, is expected to close in May.

PICKING A MUTUAL FUND CAN BE A DAUNTING TASK; 
</P>

INVESTMENT: WITH MORE THAN 2,000 CHOICES, INVESTORS CAN'T BE BLAMED FOR FEELING 
CONFUSED.

There are almost as many ways of investing in mutual funds as there are mutual 
funds, and there are an awful lot of mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say more than 2,000 funds are on the market now, running from the very 
specialized to the very broad. 
</P>
<P>
One new fund, for example, invests only in stocks of foreign utility companies, 
while asset allocation funds invest in stocks, bonds, gold and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Some funds are heavily managed; they exist only to actively trade shares of 
other mutual funds. And others are hardly managed at all, such as the index 
funds that only try to mirror, not better, the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 
500 stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The runaway growth of mutual funds during the past few years can be laid to the 
"if you can't beat them, join them" philosophy of investing, according to 
Michael Hirsch, senior vice president of Republic National Bank of New York and 
a mutual fund expert. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch says people who in the past might have bought and sold individual stocks 
have been frightened out of direct participation by the large institutional 
investors. Instead, these individuals are joining institutions themselves by 
investing through large pools of cash that mutual funds represent. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch believes that individual investors have "no business" buying and selling 
individual stocks. 
</P>
<P>
He warns that it is like "sitting down at a poker game with a $50 stake when 
everybody else has $10,000. You can be the best player in the world, (but) it's 
only a matter of time before you're wiped out." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the wide array of mutual fund choices has become as daunting for 
many as the stock market. An individual investor looking for a solid fund or 
two in which to sock away money for retirement can become paralyzed from the 
profusion of choices. How should the small investor start in funds? 
</P>
<P>
Every expert has his or her own strategy, but they all agree on one point: The 
better mutual funds have performed well in the past. Although financial markets 
change, the solid funds remain solid. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing to me," said Wesley Johnson, an independent broker in Colorado 
Springs, Colo. "I've been tracking 1,500 funds for five years, and the good 
funds are always good, the mediocre funds are always mediocre and the poor 
funds are always poor." 
</P>
<P>
A good starting point, then, is to check rankings in magazines and newspapers 
to see which funds have consistently performed well. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis is on consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about the supernovas, the one-year hotshots," said Hirsch, of 
Republic National Bank. Look for funds that have performed strongly over many 
years, he says. 
</P>
<P>
How many funds should you invest in? 
</P>
<P>
That's a good question to arouse the experts. Hirsch, whose views are 
controversial in some financial circles, believes that no one should invest in 
fewer than five funds and that there's no maximum. Fifty funds or more are fine 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch recommends that investors diversify to the maximum, putting only the 
minimum investment of $1,000 to $2,000 in each fund before moving on to the 
next. Instead of owning one growth stock fund with $10,000 in it, Hirsch says, 
the wise investor should own five with $2,000 in each. Diversify by type of 
investment, fund family and fund manager, Hirsch says. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is at the other extreme. Diversification merely waters down the gain, 
he believes. He tells his clients to pick a small handful of the most promising 
funds and put all their eggs in one, two or three baskets. His approach can 
generate big gains, and big risks, for clients. 
</P>
<P>
More typical is the view espoused by Ron Rough, the research director for 
Schabacker Investment Management, a Potomac, Md., money management and 
newsletter publishing firm. Rough believes that investors with portfolios of 
about $20,000 should aim for about five funds, diversifying not by management 
firm but by type of investment. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Rough recommends a core investment of a growth stock fund, with 
added money in bond, money market, gold and perhaps international stock mutual 
funds. He believes the beginning mutual fund investor should find one mutual 
fund family to stick with. 
</P>
<P>
That brings up the issue of whether it's worth paying fees to buy mutual funds. 
The research is clear that, as a group, funds that charge fees do not provide 
higher returns. Investors who are willing to do their own research should stick 
primarily to the no-load and low-load list. Investors who want a broker to do 
the research will need to buy funds with sales charges in the 6% to 8% range.

CELEBRITY MUD WRESTLING COMES TO ATLANTIC CITY

<P>
Despite what you hear, the high rollers who play in Atlantic City, N.J., aren't 
all flocking to the Taj Mahal casino-hotel, Donald Trump's soon-to-be-opened 
monument to wretched excess. In fact, some of Atlantic City's heaviest action 
involves the property next door to the Taj: Merv Griffin's Resorts 
International casino-hotel. 
</P>
<P>
But unfortunately for Merv, these players aren't throwing their money around in 
the Resorts casino, where he could make a few bucks off them. Instead, these 
guys are playing in the Resorts bankruptcy, where they're trying to make a few 
bucks off Merv. Not to mention off each other. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the adaptable world of Wall Street. A world in which mergers and 
acquisitions action -- or M&amp;A, as it's known -- has all but collapsed. A 
world in which the new game is to try to make money from failed M&amp;A deals 
because there aren't enough new deals to feed everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the nervous energy that used to be put into M&amp;A has been directed 
into this," quips Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., a bankruptcy veteran who is 
advising Resorts' senior bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Resorts, which was supposed to be a tidy, "prepackaged" 
bankruptcy, has turned into a four-way battle, pitting three big bondholders 
against one another and against Merv: 
</P>
<P>
* First Executive Corp., the giant Los Angeles insurance company top heavy with 
junk bonds, which owns more than $100 million of Resorts' most senior bonds, 
which total $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Sabre Associates, a fund associated with the guys who put together Coniston 
Partners but separately run, which controls $20 million to $30 million of 
Resorts' $200 million of second-most-senior bonds. 
</P>
<P>
* Jay Goldsmith and Harry Freund, two of the biggest talkers in the bankruptcy 
world, who claim to control $150 million of Resorts' $400 million of 
least-senior bonds and who seem to have painted themselves into a corner by 
making threats they can't back up. 
</P>
<P>
* Merv, who as the stockholder of Resorts is at the bottom of the pile but is 
trying to climb out by putting $30 million of new money into the company. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought that you needed mud to have mud wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
None of this would be going on had it not been for Merv, the man who made 
hundreds of millions of dollars by creating the "Wheel of Fortune" and 
"Jeopardy" TV game shows but who has blown $60 million and his reputation as a 
smart businessman on Resorts, now known as the Default Show. 
</P>
<P>
Merv, you remember, "won" Resorts in late 1988 after a widely publicized 
takeover battle with Trump but quickly ran into trouble, defaulted on Resorts' 
bonds last August and put Resorts into bankruptcy in December. 
</P>
<P>
That brought in the bankruptcy players, who live in a world in which you not 
only want to make money but also to beat up the other guy. 
</P>
<P>
In the Resorts battle, in which Merv is offering to fork over the $30 million, 
78% of the stock and some new bonds, the idea is to make such a pest of 
yourself that Merv or other bondholders will give you more than Merv's plan 
calls for. 
</P>
<P>
You do this by threatening to invoke bankruptcy rules, under which no one gets 
anything until all the creditors above him have been paid in full. 
Shareholders, who come below the creditors, are last in line. 
</P>
<P>
In a so-called consensual plan, like this one, bondholders can take less than 
full payment provided that half the bondholders in each class, owning 
two-thirds of the bonds, give their consent. Thus, if you control one-third of 
a class of bonds, you can break up a consensual plan. 
</P>
<P>
The risk you run is that the original bankruptcy rules come back into play and 
the bankrupt company may run out of assets before you get paid in full. That's 
known as being crammed down. 
</P>
<P>
One reason there's a compromise here is that, for arcane legal reasons, what 
appear to be the most-senior Resorts bonds might not be senior at all. It could 
take years to sort out. 
</P>
<P>
This prospect, plus the fact that it would probably show a gain on its bonds if 
the Griffin plan is approved, makes First Executive eager to settle. Merv, for 
obvious reasons, also wants to cut a deal. 
</P>
<P>
But Sabre and the Goldsmith-Freund team are making noises. Sabre, which 
wouldn't talk to me, has told other people that it will cram down Goldsmith and 
Freund, as well as Griffin, unless it gets a better settlement. Goldsmith and 
Freund, who have a carefully cultivated mad-dog image, threaten to blow up the 
whole plan. But, as one adviser to the Griffin forces says, "Harry and Jay are 
being less rabid than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, their position doesn't seem too good. They could get killed here, the 
same way they got killed a few years ago when they tried to cram down the 
stockholders of the bankrupt Global Marine Corp. but were themselves crammed 
down by senior creditors. Goldsmith and Freund had an indicated 90% loss, 
although they claim it was less. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith and Freund wouldn't talk to me but sent a public relations man to 
tell me that they have about as much invested in the senior Resorts bonds as 
they do in the juniors -- a claim that provoked howls of laughter from everyone 
I tried to confirm it with. 
</P>
<P>
What will finally happen, probably, is that when the dust settles, something 
like Griffin's plan will be approved. Until then, the Resorts bankruptcy will 
be a better show than The Donald and the Taj. Stay tuned.

OIL ISSUES HEAT UP AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of investors became new believers in oil stocks last year, as demand for 
oil jumped while supply tightened. In fact, 1989 marked a turning point in Wall 
Street's view of the energy business in general: Glut was the watchword of the 
'80s, but the '90s promise rising demand and rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
That thinking sparked a surge in oil stocks last year, and the rally has 
carried into '90. Now comes the test: Can the stocks hold up against an 
anticipated spring drop in oil and natural gas prices? 
</P>
<P>
Oil has already dropped to $20.39 now from about $23 a barrel in early 
February. Barry Sahgal, analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. in New York, 
notes that "there's always a seasonal dip in prices in March and April," as the 
heating season ends. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts see the potential for a bigger-than-normal drop in prices 
soon. Richard Pzena, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., said oil 
inventories usually are drained at a brisk pace in winter. That didn't happen 
this year, because of the warm winter. Meanwhile, OPEC is pumping 24 million 
barrels a day -- 2 million over its limit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So Pzena thinks that prices are going lower and that oil stocks -- most now 
near their 52-week highs -- are vulnerable to a correction. Even if oil just 
stays at current levels, he warns, the price isn't high enough for oil 
companies to show earnings growth versus 1989. And that, he said, will 
disappoint plenty of investors. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts say interest in these stocks remains so strong that investors 
are already looking past any spring weakness in energy prices. "I think that's 
why the stocks haven't been hit" despite oil's slump, Sahgal said. He sees 
supply and demand back in sync by summer, as refineries temporarily closed for 
repair come back on stream and take more crude oil off the market. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Miller, who follows oil drilling and service stocks for Shearson Lehman 
Hutton, admits that if Wall Street is wrong about spring supply and demand -- 
and oil drops another $3 to $4 -- "the stocks are vulnerable." Many oil field 
stocks, such as Baker Hughes and Halliburton, have risen 60% or more in a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller believes that many oil investors are taking the long view -- that 
short-term dips notwithstanding, the energy business is in a sustained up 
trend. "If you look at the worldwide oil demand situation, it's the early 1970s 
again," he argues.

Unstoppable Boeing? Boeing Co. stock has been on a tear: From $61.125 on Feb. 
26, it's now at $73.25, an all-time high. After Boeing hosted an upbeat meeting 
for analysts last week, many raised earnings estimates and reiterated "buy" 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Rubel, analyst at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell in New York, notes 
that Boeing "fits right into the pattern of what investors are looking for 
these days": Strong earnings growth and a healthy balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by a huge backlog of jet orders, Boeing should earn about $6 a share 
this year, versus $2.94 last year, Wall Street figures. In '91, Rubel sees at 
least $7.15. 
</P>
<P>
At $73.25 a share, Boeing's stock price/earnings ratio based on $6 earnings in 
1990 is about 12, versus a market average of 13. So that, too, gives the stock 
continuing allure. 
</P>
<P>
But how much more potential is left in the stock? At this stage, money managers 
are already looking out to 1992, when they fear that development costs for a 
new 777 jet line will begin to crimp profits. Even so, analyst Lawrence Harris 
at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles believes Boeing might reach 
$87 to $90 a share before big investors begin to feel uncomfortable. That would 
be a 19% to 23% rise from here. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, analyst William Deatherage at Dean Witter Reynolds notes that the 
history of Boeing stock is that "it tends to move for long periods of time in 
one direction." In the early 1980s, the stock soared for four straight years. 
The latest up trend began late in 1987 and so has run a little more than two 
years. And if Boeing has ever been primed to pleasantly surprise Wall Street on 
the earnings front, it's now. The current boom in jet orders "is the most 
powerful the industry has ever had," Deatherage said. 
</P>

Briefly: Shares of some Japanese firms traded in this country far outpaced 
Tokyo's rebound late last week, suggesting that some U.S. investors believe the 
plunge there is over. Matsushita jumped $11.625 to $133.75 Friday, TDK rose 
$1.75 to $38, Canon gained $3.125 to $50 and NEC Corp. soared $6.375 to 
$62.625.

SAGET DRAWS STRENGTH FROM LIVELY AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Bob Saget's style as host of ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" is glib 
spontaneity; he comes across as a nice guy who thinks fast and funny, if he's 
lucky. More than likely, the truth is that he operates from a well-rehearsed 
script, with all the ad-libs carefully penciled in. 
</P>
<P>
But after seeing Saget perform Friday night at the Hyatt Regency Alicante's Top 
Secret Comedy Club, it's not a big leap to believe that all his between-videos 
patter is impromptu. Saget's show was less a stand-up act than a prolonged 
conversation with the audience -- some of it was witty, some of it amusing, 
some of it corny, some of it flat. 
</P>
<P>
Whether his stream-of-consciousness manner consistently worked or not, one 
thing kept coming through: Saget is a middle-America ideal, a soft-focused 
comic who rarely threatens, and when he does, it's usually with an unspoken 
apology. He's the type of guy every mother could love, or at least tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, he's perfect for TV. 
</P>
<P>
While he had a few regular bits, Saget generally depended on improvisation -- 
he hasn't done stand-up in a while, so you can forgive him the dearth of 
material -- and he is quick. He's got a bright comeback for everything. 
</P>
<P>
But his riffs didn't carry the lunatic fringe of the great improvisers, like 
Robin Williams or Jonathan Winters. Comics like those two take us into their 
uncanny world and provide a different, charged outlook. Saget maps out more 
familiar, often mundane terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Much of it comes from his audience interactions, and if he has a bunch of duds 
out there, watch out. It's safe to say that Saget, when at his best Friday, was 
only as good as his audience, and he was fortunate to have a lively crowd with 
a few peculiar stories to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Take the woman who had neck problems after her husband sat on her. Saget 
grabbed that almost immediately and used it like a touchstone through his 
hourlong set. When the tempo or attention flagged, he shimmied over to the neck 
lady; the audience loved his pirouettes around her physical troubles. 
</P>
<P>
They talked back to him, he talked back to them, and everybody seemed to enjoy 
it. Even the more constructed bits involved a good deal of give and take, like 
when Saget discussed the merits of stores like K mart and Target. He sang a 
ditty about the two competitors getting along and gabbed about the tackiness of 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before he was inviting comments from people who shopped there. 
Or those who buy clothes at Woolworth's, eat at Denny's or like Judge Wapner on 
"The People's Court." These were sardonic but always friendly exchanges that 
underscored his agreeable approach. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Saget confessed that he used to hate obnoxious people until he 
discovered he was one. True, his routine can be trying, especially when he 
rambles on, and there's an unctuous shading in the rapport he creates. 
</P>
<P>
But obnoxious is too conclusive a word; Saget just doesn't have the edginess to 
assume that description. In some ways, you wish he did.

PIXIES' BLACK FRANCIS WORKS UP A VOCAL LATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memo to Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro and other masters of manic performance: 
Don't look back, because somebody might be gaining on you. 
</P>
<P>
That somebody is a plump, doughy-faced young man from Boston who goes by the 
name of Black Francis. Francis (real name Charles Thompson IV) hardly moved his 
body as he fronted the Pixies on Saturday night at a packed Crawford Hall on 
the UC Irvine campus. Instead, he contorted his voice for 80 minutes until it 
had passed through all the stations of the cross, probed each circle of hell 
and otherwise served as tour guide for an extended journey to the center of a 
very strange mind. 
</P>
<P>
Francis barked and yapped and moaned and screamed, in Spanish as well as in 
English, letting loose the sounds of pain and surprise and animal urgency that 
we'd probably all go around making if we didn't have to keep up a veneer of 
common civility. The Pixies' method is to hack away the crust of custom and 
indifference that usually protects us from the otherwise unbearably searing 
onslaught of experience. 
</P>
<P>
That emotional extremism is what has made the Pixies' three albums special and 
earned them as much critical applause as any of their current peers in 
college/alternative-rock circles. It is one thing, though, for a singer to go 
over the edge in the recording studio, where all that's required is to psyche 
oneself for one psychodramatic take, and quite another to replicate the feat on 
song after song during a concert. The Pixies' reputation as a live band hasn't 
matched their acclaim as a recording band -- understandably so, because few 
performers can be expected consistently to peel back the skin and uncover the 
nerve endings that are set aquiver in almost all of their songs. 
</P>
<P>
At Crawford Hall, Black Francis quivered like some psychic tuning fork, working 
himself into a clenched lather on each song. Or, more accurately, working his 
voice into that lather. While not exactly straitjacketing himself, Francis used 
much less body English than one would expect of a performer howling out the 
feelings in the Pixies' songs. Almost all the time, he simply stood at the 
microphone, playing his guitar and singing with his eyes and face scrunched up. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it was fitting that Francis merely sang like a madman instead of 
running about like one. Coursing through his songs is a deep discomfort with 
physicality. "This human form, where I was born, I now repent," he sang in 
"Caribou." On "Wave Of Mutilation," the idea of human flesh disintegrating into 
formless matter gives rise not to horror but to a song of anthem-like 
affirmation. In Francis' world, decomposition is the path to immortality. 
</P>
<P>
Running headlong into this abnegation of the body is the blazing libido that 
rises up in many other Pixies songs. It's that clash that moves the band so far 
from the routine of ordinary life, where we try to smooth over such 
contradictions, and so deep into a naked tumult of unresolved feeling. 
</P>
<P>
If Francis had spent the whole show screaming and cackling, the Pixies' act 
would quickly have worn thin. But he was expert at shifting registers and vocal 
textures, so that a low growl would turn into a high cry. He also did a good 
deal of solid, straightforwardly tuneful singing in a clear, strong voice. But 
the screams were what drove the mania, in peak moments such as "Monkey Gone to 
Heaven," which ended with Francis howling out apocalyptic numerology in his own 
skewed take on the Book of Revelations. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Kim Deal was an ideal foil for Francis. Her backup singing and shared 
vocal leads were airy enough to cushion his rough edges but also wild and 
trenchant enough in their own right to egg him on. While the other Pixies were 
pictures of intensity, Deal, with her perpetual smile, was an embodiment of 
sheer satisfaction in performing. 
</P>
<P>
Lead guitarist Joey Santiago was an impassive, stolid presence but his 
bone-white Les Paul always stirred sonic motion. Santiago's palette of sounds 
ranged from feedback whines to catchy riffing, all of it applied with skill and 
control that helped take the music to the edge without driving it over a cliff 
into formless noisemaking. Drummer David Lovering's thrash beats, gallops and 
metallic thuds kept the crowd in front of the stage roiling through much of the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The Pixies blazed through 31 songs, including several that don't appear on 
their albums. While one might quibble that a few too many of those were fast, 
thrashing, noisy workouts, stylistic variety was nevertheless a strength of the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
In a neat symmetry, the band opened and closed with modern surf rock -- 
starting with a Surftones' cover, and finishing the pre-encore set with their 
own "Tony's Theme," a wild, hard-driving update of the old surf-instrumental 
standard "Pipeline." In between the Pixies explored a range of other sources. 
"Here Comes Your Man," tacked a zesty Tex-Mex guitar figure onto a zesty pop 
song that recalled the lighter side of the Velvet Underground (Santiago's 
guitar-noise walls showed the influence of the Velvets' darker fabrications). 
The sinister "Mr. Grieves" began with a reggae beat a la Elvis Costello's 
"Watching the Detectives" and ended with the moaning slog of a New Orleans 
funeral march. The encore, "Into the White," was closer to the approach of the 
Pixies' fellow alternative-rock darlings Sonic Youth -- a combination of 
throbbing, swarming guitars and an incantatory lead vocal by Deal. 
</P>
<P>
Those stylistic connections to the past served as the anchor for a highly 
charged performance that took off into the darkness and fascination of our 
uncharted emotions.

Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," the Museum of Contemporary Art was readying its 
own idea of a capital event, the first retrospective of the work of John 
Baldessari, one of the smartest ideas in MOCA's short history. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours before preview and things weren't going very well. The catalogue had 
not arrived from Japan, the show (to June 17) was undergoing a last-minute 
rehanging. Sigh. It looked as if reality was going to act as a metaphor of the 
supposed complexity of Baldessari's work. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it turned out fine. The catalogue by Coosje Van Bruggen came 
galumphing in at the 11th hour. A few helpful insights are wedged into its 
dogged prose. And the show does what it is supposed to do. It clarifies the 
artist in a way no number of single gallery exhibitions can. One is tempted to 
say it immediately promotes him from the most underrated of major California 
artists to the most overrated, but that's a bit too facile. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone not wired to contemporary art, John Baldessari is a 58-year-old 
artist who grew up in the anonymous grubbiness of National City with 
expectations of going no further in life than teaching high school and making a 
bit of a local reputation as an artist. He pursued both dreams and wound up a 
figure of international reputation. Teaching -- at CalArts instead of Chula 
Vista High -- he evolved into a kind of guru. His influence, both direct and 
oblique, is downright astonishing. You can see his fingerprints on virtually 
every member of the younger generation who continues to dominate the high-risk 
lane of today's art from Cindy Sherman to Robert Longo. Nobody knows how long 
this will endure in the quick-extinct ambience of the times, but it is 
nonetheless an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
What did he do and how did he do it? 
</P>
<P>
We think of artists as making their mark by adding something, something 
original. Baldessari has functioned by subtraction. Subtraction is not original 
in contemporary art; it comes from abstract Minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to this revealing show, one had the impression that Baldessari's art had 
at least the virtue of not looking like anyone else's. It still doesn't, but 
now it's clear that its look comes from a synthesis of Pop, Minimalism and 
Conceptualism combined and systematically wrung out like a sponge until 
Baldessari got it where he wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest works on view are late-'60s canvases bearing either lettered 
mottoes, grimy photographs or both. Their debt to Ed Ruscha is clear in one 
called "Pure Beauty," but Baldessari makes it his own by subtracting Ruscha's 
visual charm and turning it into a set of ironic "art lessons," purposely dumb 
like quotes from cheap, How-To art manuals. One begins significantly with the 
title, "Tips for Artists Who Want to Sell." In another, the artist shows a 
tatty snapshot of a man under a palm tree. The whole thing is labeled "Wrong." 
It's amusing, but it's also in the business of amputating art of certain 
components, its idealism and visual impact. The work is anonymous and 
impersonal, like the efforts of a shy person in a faceless suburb, a 
do-it-yourselfer trying to teach himself art despite utter ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
Baldessari was decades ahead of the pack when it came to practicing what is now 
called Deconstruction. He beat the kids by a mile in using other people's art 
for his own, you know, Appropriation. In 1968, he reproduced a Frank Stella and 
called it "A 1968 Painting." In 1969, he commissioned paintings from 14 
artists. The 13 on view each show a Photorealist image of a hand pointing to 
something: a stove burner, an extinct light bulb. Each bears the caption "A 
Painting by . . ." with the artist's name affixed. But they become Baldessari's 
-- or nobody's -- subtracting individuality and inventiveness from the list. 
The artist's job is to point things out. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Baldessari's quest is basically fulfilled. He has unhooked art 
from the tethers that bound it for centuries to physical substance -- to paint, 
wood, or marble -- and reduced it to a set of images that are only one step 
from being as disembodied as a movie or television picture. He invented a 
visual form that communicates through montage, juxtaposition and implied word 
associations. It beams to a television generation rather than a museum crowd. 
Try watching an old movie with the sound off and in a few minutes you will see 
lots of Baldessaris flickering through it, powerful subliminal symbols like 
those of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
He has said, "I guess I'm using images from movies, from newspapers and so on 
because there lies the arch-power of language. We can't sit down and talk in 
Sanskrit, we have to talk in a language that we know." It is interesting, but 
it isn't art. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, intoning the phrase "It isn't art" is a masked way of saying "I don't 
like it," but that's not what is meant here. Art is a language with a grammar 
going back to the caves of Lascaux and the Venus of Willendorf. It communicates 
in many of the same ways as Baldessari, but deprived of its sensual component 
it loses corporeal authority and becomes a fiction of the mind. Looking at it 
is like trying to make love to someone without a body. To say this is not art 
is an objective description. This is not French but German. 
</P>
<P>
If it all sounds both complex and theoretical; that's misleading. Baldessari's 
art-language is as easily grasped as graphic design, which may account for his 
success and that of his brood. You can read the work without going to the 
trouble of learning the language of art, and it is often quite entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
If Baldessari's tactics sound destructive of art, there lies a huge paradox 
because he is forever quoting art as if it were holy writ. Early on, he blows 
cigar smoke next to Polaroids of clouds, tipping his stogie to Joe Goode. He 
combines text and little objects in the fashion of Alexis Smith. Always 
somewhat professorially impersonal, he betrays a lyric side in a snake charmer 
string of pretty postcards and a religious facet in an homage to Malevich where 
a big white square descends into a suburban yard like some holy UFO. 
</P>
<P>
Later works have grown bigger, angrier and more socially critical. Often 
montages of separately framed stock photos, if they were rendered in paint 
they'd look like work by Rosenquist or Rauschenberg. A work like "Horizontal 
Men" borrows a bit back from Robert Longo. 
</P>
<P>
They're a lot prettier these days, but they decipher so easily you can't 
remember them after leaving the gallery, and if you come back they are like 
movies you've already seen. Baldessari is not so often showing his old capacity 
for the surprising association -- like the one of the silhouette of a giant 
pelican in the desert that was somehow certainly a poem about Jimmy Carter's 
failed hostage-rescue attempt in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
There are still queasy, surreal images like "Inventory," which equates a 
railroad car of corpses with supermarket shelves. But too often these days you 
get a B-movie image of a man and woman smiling at each other, their gaze 
bridged by a wolf stalking across a log. Got it. The animal conflict lurking 
beneath romance. It takes about 30 seconds each to take in his ecological 
protests, the feminist polemics and anthropological ruminations. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's been a big 10 days for art: more trouble for the NEA, ghastly 
burglary at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the Getty's Van Gogh and 
a major traveling Baldessari show. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is closed today, but have a look later, and then pick the event that 
will still make us feel good in 10 years.

'DREAM,' 'ACHE': SURREALISM AT THE TAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ongoing look back at plays from the '50s and '60s at the Mark Taper Forum 
-- its "50/60 Vision" festival -- opens our eyes wide with Edward Albee's "The 
American Dream" and Harold Pinter's "A Slight Ache." These paired exercises in 
satire and surreality (Round 5 of 6) snap, bristle and pop. 
</P>
<P>
In "The American Dream," we are confronted by the prequel to "The Sandbox," not 
in terms of the dates when the plays first encountered an audience ("The 
Sandbox" in 1960, "American Dream" in '61), but in terms of respective 
gestations. Albee was writing "American Dream" when he set it aside to deliver 
"Sandbox" on a commission from the Spoleto Festival (though it was eventually 
premiered in New York). 
</P>
<P>
Three of the characters are the same in both plays, while the Young Man in 
"Dream" is a variant of the one in "Sandbox." Director Ethan Silverman's 
casting of three of the "Sandbox" actors (only one in the same role, however) 
lends particular resonance to this "American Dream." Theatergoers lucky enough 
to catch both productions, or those attending the April 7 marathon, will get an 
added chuckle out of this hall of mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
If "Sandbox" is Mommy, Daddy and Grandma at the Beach, "Dream" is Mommy, Daddy 
and Grandma at Home. Its satire doesn't only last longer than the 15-minute 
"Sandbox," it's more raw, naked and savage. 
</P>
<P>
Without belaboring the plot (secondary to intent in any case), "American Dream" 
deconstructs false values, unmasks familial cruelty and strips down -- 
literally -- social veneer. In Albee's view, this is not surreality but true 
reality lurking behind ceremonial sham. 
</P>
<P>
Passive Daddy is played this time by Alan Oppenheimer and shrewish Mommy by 
Teri Garr. The understated John Robert Lafleur is the Albee alter ego as the 
good-looking Young Man who ties off the loose ends. But the play virtually 
belongs to comedienne Angela Paton (the Mommy in "Sandbox") as the hilarious 
Mrs. Barker -- and to that stylish whippet of a Mary Carver, who continues her 
"Sandbox" role as irrepressible Grandma, mistress of the blunt truth and 
frontal attack. 
</P>
<P>
With Pinter's "A Slight Ache" we move deeper into surrealistic territory. This 
play, originally written for radio then transposed to the stage, is a strenuous 
exercise for 2 1/2 actors. 
</P>
<P>
Long-married Flora and Edward, who live peacefully in the country, are troubled 
by a match-seller standing at the back gate of their garden. Since it's an 
untraveled lane, there is no one to buy, and the seller's silent, perpetual 
presence begins to disturb Edward, who sends Flora to invite him in. 
</P>
<P>
But talking to the man in Edward's study elicits no response, which increases 
Edward's agitation. When Flora decides to take matters into her own hands, the 
stranger's silence becomes an aphrodisiac, drawing her to him irresistibly. 
Inquisitors become confessors and by play's end, Flora is installing the match 
seller as master of the house while Edward may well end up selling matches. 
</P>
<P>
Ritual transmogrification? The revenge of the wasp they kill at the start of 
the play? Another exciting writer flexing young muscles? "I've been engaged on 
the dimensionality and continuity of space . . . and time . . . for years," 
says Edward, for whatever it's worth. 
</P>
<P>
The piece isn't meant to withstand literal scrutiny. Suffice it to say that, of 
the 11 plays seen in this retrospective so far, "Slight Ache" is among the most 
potent, no small thanks to Michael Arabian's urgent yet contained direction and 
stunning performances from Paton and Bill Moor as the couple. 
</P>
<P>
We do better to heed Pinter's own words: "My characters tell me so much and no 
more," he wrote in 1962. "Between my lack of biographical data about them and 
the ambiguity of what they say lies a territory which is not only worthy of 
exploration but which it is compulsory to explore. . . . Most of the time we're 
inexpressive, giving little away, unreliable, elusive, evasive, obstructive, 
unwilling. But it's out of these attributes that a language arises. A language 
. . . where under what is said, another thing is being said." 
</P>
<P>
Explore. Widely and at will.

Love in the Balcony: Theater operators in Beijing have come up with a way to 
bring young couples to the movies: eight of Beijing's 17 film theaters have 
installed more than 400 special double seats, all at the rear of the theaters' 
balconies, to allow couples to be affectionate and alone, the state-run 
newspaper China Daily reported Sunday. The flocks of young lovers who regularly 
fill the seats are known as "Mandarin Ducks," and the English-language daily 
said the special seats -- with high backs and high arms that shield the view -- 
are also lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
Liu Hongpeng, manager of Beijing's Capital Cinema, said his theater's 69 
special seats produce an important source of steady revenue. The lovers' seats 
cost 85 cents, about four times the price of the cheapest single ticket.

WARREN ZEVON IS STILL STEERING CLEAR OF DEEP WATERS; 
</P>
<P>
CRACKERJACK BAND'S COACH HOUSE PERFORMANCE WAS HURT BY ITS RELIANCE ON ROTE 
'70S ARRANGEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warren Zevon's strongest asset has always been the overtly clever, often 
incisive, narrative quality of his songs. His best ones have shown an attention 
for detail that moves like a street-sweeper through the California dream. But 
far less often has Zevon given the impression he was reaching into his own 
depths for his material, and there is an emotional distance to much of his 
work. Unfortunately, Zevon's performance at the Coach House on Saturday seemed 
custom-designed to make that distance even greater. 
</P>
<P>
A competent guitarist himself, Zevon was joined by bassist Jennifer Condos, 
drummer Ian Wallace and guitarist Frank Simes in a crackerjack band. But the 
prize was missing. Nearly every song was given an overamped, hard-rocking 
arrangement. When Neil Young gives his material a similar treatment, it is 
usually to push it to such a jagged, dangerous musical edge that the songs 
become all the more personal. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking that chancy approach, and further hampered by his uninflected baritone, 
Zevon's lyrics instead were submerged in rote '70s arrangements that made many 
of the efforts in the 14-song set sound like Jo Jo Gunne on a bad night. Even 
his more reflective recent songs, such as "Splendid Isolation" and 1987's 
"Detox Mansion," took on an arena-rock sheen, which only worked well with the 
crowd-pleasers "Werewolves of London" and "Lawyers, Guns and Money." 
</P>
<P>
The only point where the music seemed to aid the content was on Zevon's sci-fi 
themed "Transverse City." Singing of "poisoned waves of grain," Zevon paints a 
harrowing future: "Here's the hum of desperation / Here's the test tube mating 
call / Here's the latest carbon cycle / Here's the clergy of the mall." The 
tense rhythm section and Simes' dissonant flanged guitar lines underscored the 
vocal in a way begged for by the rest of the set. 
</P>
<P>
Openers the Raindogs were a far more persuasive musical outfit, working Celtic 
and American folk influences into a roots-rock context. The result compared 
favorably with John Mellencamp's recent Fairport Convention Meets American 
Harvester efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Setting the Boston-based band up a notch in the crowded roots-guy field are 
Johnny Cunningham's excellent fiddle and mandolin manipulations. Apart from 
"Something Wouldn't Be the Same," which was driven by front man Mark Cutler's 
sinuous guitar lines, Cunningham's Scottish-tinged string work provided most of 
the band's color. 
</P>
<P>
While the quintet played with a passionate precision, and Cutler offered an 
appealing, if limited, voice, the band seemed constrained by its short 
30-minute set time, and a repertoire that was only occasionally worthy of their 
musicianship. Of the band's eight songs, only the closing "Dirty Town" (a new 
song not on the recently released "Lost Souls" album) provided sufficient 
kindling for the group to catch fire, keeping pace with Cunningham's frenzied 
romps on both his instruments.

SADAO WATANABE SHINES, BUT THE BEAT WOBBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a curiously quixotic feeling to Sadao Watanabe's opening set at the 
Palace Theatre Thursday night. The veteran Japanese jazz alto saxophonist 
seemed bound and determined to make his straight-ahead music fit into the 
clattering, over-amplified fusion playing of his accompanying group. 
</P>
<P>
With 50 records -- both mainstream and jazz/fusion style -- under his belt, 
Watanabe clearly has proven that he can adapt to the changing tides of musical 
fashion; in the early '70s, he was one of the first mainstream musicians to 
play fusion. But the core of his work has always been, and continues to be, 
centered in a jubilant, Phil Woods-like be-bop that is articulate and energetic 
enough to stand on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this time around Watanabe elected to showcase his playing in the 
framework of an aggressively contemporary rhythm section -- one whose idea of 
intensity usually seemed to involve rushing the tempo. Worse, whether the music 
was Brazilian samba, straight-ahead jazz or contemporary fusion, the 
accompaniment generally fell into a hard-edged groove and repeated it, ad 
infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that Watanabe's soaring lines -- overflowing with filigree 
ornamentation in the ballads and bursting out of the chord changes on the 
up-tempos -- rarely received the support they deserved. Still, there were 
times, as on the bossa nova "Elis," when the rhythmic foundation integrated 
well with Watanabe's soloing. More often than not, he was left to twist and 
turn on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Rachelle Ferrell, who joined the group for two wildly melismatic vocals, 
sounded like a young star with a promising future. DON HECKMAN

POP CAPSULES : OVER-AMPED ZEVON CAN'T MAKE UP THE DISTANCE

Warren Zevon's strongest asset is his overtly clever, often incisive narrative 
quality -- an attention for detail that moves like a street-sweeper through the 
California dream. Rarely does he give the impression that he's reaching into 
his own depths for his material, so there's an emotional distance to much of 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
Zevon's performance at the Coach House on Saturday made that distance even 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every song was obscured by an over-amped, hard-rocking arrangement that 
sounded like Jo Jo Gunne on a bad night. Even Zevon's more reflective recent 
songs such as "Splendid Isolation" and 1987's "Detox Mansion" took on an 
arena-rock sheen, with perhaps only the bleak, science-fiction themed 
"Transverse City" being aided by a dissonant band arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Openers the Raindogs were a far more persuasive outfit, working Celtic and 
American folk influences into a roots-rock context that compares favorably with 
John Mellencamp's recent material. JIM WASHBURN

POP CAPSULES : CUTTING A PATH BEYOND THE MINUTEMEN'S SPRAWL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The forced insularity of the Orange County rock scene has forged some bands 
with distinctive visions. Case in point: Friday's show at Bogart's in Long 
Beach with Don't Mean Maybe, Eggplant and Bazooka. 
</P>
<P>
Although Don't Mean Maybe's debut "Live Sample" album has just been released, 
the trio has already been dismissed by some as Minutemen second-hands. But 
while the convoluted rhythms and fierce attack Friday did beg some comparison, 
the trio cut its own sure path through and beyond the Minutemen's sprawling 
influence. While still a bit unformed lyrically, the group pumped a rampaging 
sense of life into the skitter-rhythmed "Live Sample," an exuberant celebration 
of coffee ("Happy Beans"), and even a version of the Zep's "Houses of the Holy" 
that sounded like a Captain Beefheart outtake. 
</P>
<P>
Eggplant was only scarcely less engaging, with not so great an ensemble spark, 
but some well-crafted, pleasingly quirky songwriting and cliche-free guitar 
excursions. JIM WASHBURN

In a resurgence of violence in the Caucasus, Armenian nationalists killed nine 
Azerbaijanis, including a family of five who were burned alive, Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
Attacks occurred in three villages along the border of Christian Armenia and 
Muslim Azerbaijan. The violence was the worst since martial law was declared in 
January in an effort to halt open fighting between residents of the two 
republics. Tass also reported that a train in Armenia on its way to Baku, the 
capital of Azerbaijan, was rocked by an explosion.

A father and son and the woman they allegedly wanted to avenge have been booked 
for investigation of murder after a barroom shooting that left three men dead. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Herbert Jacobsen, 46, his son, Ronald Jacobsen, 20, and Vickie 
Jane Bird, 33, all of Stockton. Bird, who had been in an argument with one of 
the victims, allegedly urged the elder Jacobsen to avenge her, San Joaquin 
County sheriff's deputies said. The shootings apparently stemmed from the 
dispute between Bird and one of the victims, Francis Ollis, 26, of Stockton. 
Two men, Victor Luft, 24, and Timothy Loveland, 26, both of Stockton, were shot 
and killed when they went to Ollis' aid, investigators said.

Camp Parks, a 2,268-acre reserve training center about 25 miles east of San 
Francisco, is "extremely vital" and should be kept open despite efforts by 
local officials to sell the aging base, said the commander of the U.S. Army 
Reserve. "It makes considerably greater sense in terms of economics and the 
interests of defense to retain Camp Parks as an important training facility," 
said Maj. Gen. William F. Ward. Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward) asked Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney to keep open several San Francisco Bay-area military 
installations targeted for closure but to shut Camp Parks.

AKIRA KUROSAWA EARNS OSCAR FOR LIFE'S WORK; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: THE LEGENDARY DIRECTOR OF 'RAN' AND 'RASHOMON' WILL RECEIVE AN HONORARY 
OSCAR TONIGHT FOR LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The man widely regarded as the world's greatest living film director was in a 
jovial mood as he sat in his Beverly Hills hotel suite Friday morning. Akira 
Kurosawa, who tonight receives an honorary Oscar for his lifetime achievement, 
didn't seem to mind that he had a full day of work ahead on what happened to be 
his 80th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was here in 1986 on my birthday when 'Ran' was nominated, and that was no 
big deal," said a smiling Kurosawa through his interpreter, film historian 
Audie Bock and translator of Kurosawa's 1981 "Something Like an Autobiography." 
"I sure don't feel like I'm 80. Nothing special is planned, we'll just go out 
to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I feel like behaving like a total fool, but I can't do it 
because my producers are here," exclaimed Kurosawa, indicating his son Hisao 
and his nephew Mike Y. Inoue, who retorted, "You've been doing that all along." 
</P>
<P>
What Kurosawa has in fact been doing for half a century is to tell stories on 
the screen superlatively well, creating images that stick permanently in the 
memory -- the swift tracking shots through the forest in "Rashomon"; the shot 
in "Ikiru" of Takashi Shimura, as a petty bureaucrat sitting in a swing under a 
softly falling snow, dying but content in his belief that he has succeeded in 
giving his life meaning; the comical swagger of Toshiro Mifune's itching, 
scratching samurai in "Yojimbo" and "Sanjiro," or the shocked expression of 
Mifune's Macbeth in "Throne of Blood" as he realizes that he has been fatally 
impaled by a flurry of arrows. The list of unforgettable moments goes on and 
on. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no resting on laurels for Kurosawa -- tall, vigorous and dapper 
as ever. Right now he's busy helping promote his latest picture, "Akira 
Kurosawa's Dreams," an eight-episode film based on actual dreams he experienced 
throughout his lifetime, which Warners is releasing worldwide. Currently being 
subtitled, it's slated to launch the Cannes Festival in May. The screenplay for 
his next picture is already written, he says, but is not ready to be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Although his impact upon other directors is undeniable, Kurosawa professes not 
to see it himself. (No, the squabbling of RTD2 and C-3PO in "Star Wars" didn't 
remind him of his quarreling peasants in "The Hidden Fortress," even though 
George Lucas told him that they were a direct inspiration). He would rather 
savor the memories of meetings with men such as King Vidor, Frank Capra and 
John Ford -- men whose work he has admired all his life. 
</P>
<P>
His admiration of other directors is by no means restricted to the old masters. 
"For example, I think Coppola's 'Godfather, Part II,' is a very good picture," 
he said. "It has the feeling of being a really professional job of filmmaking. 
The thing that surprises me most about it is that sequels are almost invariably 
of lesser quality -- and that is definitely not the case here. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish I could see all that Francis left out of 'Apocalypse Now.' I heard 
from the Japanese distributor, Nippon Herald, that the various longer cuts were 
really spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his hotel room armchair, Kurosawa wondered aloud whether he really 
deserves his Oscar. "I have the feeling that I'm getting it partly because I've 
turned 80 and that it is an expression of warm feeling toward me." 
</P>
<P>
The truth, of course, is that it is long overdue.

'GENERATIONS' DRAWS BLACKS DESPITE RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after NBC introduced "Generations" as the first daytime soap opera to 
center around a black family, the program has won praise for its presentation 
of black issues but remains locked in last place in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
According to A. C. Nielsen ratings released last week, "Generations," which 
celebrates its first anniversary Tuesday, ranks 12th out of the 12 daily soaps 
aired by the three major networks and 19th out of 21 daytime programs. It 
reaches about 2 million households a day -- about a third of the audience 
garnered by the highest ranked soap, CBS' "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
Airing weekdays at 11:30 a.m., "Generations" chronicles the lives of two 
wealthy Chicago families, the Marshalls, who are black, and the Whitmores, who 
are white. The families have been linked for three generations -- since the 
days when the matriarch of the Marshalls worked as a maid for the matriarch of 
the Whitmores. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the typical soap fare of relationships, money and personal tragedy, 
"Generations" gives viewers a dose of themes not normally seen in daytime 
drama. Last year, one of the characters struggled with sickle-cell anemia, a 
disease that strikes blacks, and the current story line involves racial hate 
crimes that befall the Marshalls when they move into an all-white, upper-crust 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
As television programs go, observed Gerald Horne, chairman of black studies at 
the University of California at Santa Barbara, "Generations" has made progress 
in portraying the black experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Relative to some of the images that have been projected -- for example, 
'Driving Miss Daisy,' which portrays blacks in an antiquated manner -- then at 
least 'Generations' is a step forward," Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
Where it falls short, Horne said, is in the fact that the Marshalls, because of 
their wealth, are less than typical. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'Generations' and the other television programs have not really 
captured the vast majority of the black American experience," Horne said. "They 
either portray the extreme underclass or the very wealthy blacks. Most blacks 
are somewhere in between." 
</P>
<P>
NBC executives insist that the program's low ratings are to be expected after 
only one year on the air and say that the network is as committed to 
"Generations" as it was to "Hill Street Blues" in that groundbreaking series's 
difficult first years. 
</P>
<P>
Soap operas are a daily habit, and before viewers will bring a new show into 
their lives, they have to be slowly weaned from other programs, explained Sally 
Sussman, the program's creator and executive producer. She said that the show 
will not be changed to court viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"We came on the air as a landmark show fully integrated, and we've kept that 
commitment even in the face of low ratings," she said. "We just hope the 
audience will grow with us." 
</P>
<P>
One factor in the show's favor comes, ironically, from the very obstacles that 
blacks face in television. Because the job market for black actors is so 
limited, the program has managed to snag and hold on to a number of fairly 
well-known players, including Taurean Blacque, whose credits include "Hill 
Street Blues" and "The White Shadow," and Richard Roundtree, who starred in the 
"Shaft" movies of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, I've been pushed into stereotypical roles as policemen" in 
action films, said Roundtree. "I wanted to do some drama." 
</P>
<P>
"My agent turned ('Generations') down two times," said Blacque, who plays Henry 
Marshall, the entrepreneurial scion of the Marshall family and owner of a 
string of ice cream parlors. "Coming off a hit show like 'Hill Street Blues,' 
they didn't think I wanted to do a soap. But, when I read it, I saw what it 
could do for me as a black person and what I could portray to the community." 
</P>
<P>
The program's most recent addition is daytime Emmy winner Debbi Morgan, who 
left a long-running stint on ABC's "All My Children" to join the fledgling 
soap. 
</P>
<P>
For these actors, the appeal is simple: "Most of what's out there is garbage," 
said Blacque. 
</P>
<P>
"The younger generation, when they see (negative roles) all the time, they 
think maybe that is something we ought to do -- be a pimp, sell drugs, drive a 
big Cadillac," he said. "I think our responsibility to the younger people 
coming up is to project a positive image." 
</P>
<P>
NBC's motives in creating "Generations" were not entirely altruistic, however. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by Nielsen Media Research show that blacks watch an average 
of 55% more daytime television than other groups. And, before "Generations," 
NBC's daytime programming garnered fewer black viewers than the other 
networks'. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite obvious that we were not reaching as much of the black audience 
as the other guys, the other networks," said NBC spokesman Gene Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
"Generations" ranks about equal with the other networks' major soaps in terms 
of audience composition, with 21% of its audience black. It leads NBC's other 
soaps: Just 11% of "Days of Our Lives" viewers are black, 12% of "Another 
World" viewers and 16% of "Santa Barbara" viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons the networks have been running more black shows and more 
black characters is (that) blacks disproportionately don't have access to VCRs 
and cable television and satellites," said Horne, the UCSB professor. 
</P>
<P>
That means they are more likely than whites to watch network advertising and 
buy the products offered for sale, Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Dobson, vice president of daytime sales for NBC, said that while 
"Generations" has not attracted advertising aimed specifically at blacks, the 
increased percentage of black viewers -- even with the show's low ratings -- 
has meant an increase in ad revenues. 
</P>
<P>
This year, commercials on "Generations" will cost 45% more than when the 
program started, Dobson said. And, even at its inception, advertisers were 
willing to pay 24% more for an ad on "Generations" than they were for an ad on 
"Scrabble," the game show previously aired in its time slot. 
</P>
<P>
One reason "Generations" is appealing to advertisers despite its low ratings is 
that black households have 13% more women in them than other households, and 
it's women that the advertisers are trying to reach, Dobson said. 
</P>
<P>
While "Generations" has afforded black actors opportunities not generally found 
in television, the people behind the scenes are mostly white. Sussman is white, 
as are four of the show's six writers. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't found any more," Sussman said. "I don't know of any other black soap 
opera writers." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she would be open to a Writers Guild apprentice program for 
minorities and women, but "they've never contacted me." 
</P>
<P>
Blacque hopes this situation will change. "On both levels -- behind the scenes 
and in the decision-making process, the writing staff -- of course there should 
be more (blacks)," the actor said. "Because you need a black person to really 
get to the essence of our experience as black people."

DISNEY NO-AD POLICY IN MOVIE THEATERS SPARKS NEW DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Walt Disney Co. may have instituted a new no on-screen advertising policy 
with its release last Friday of "Pretty Woman," but it doesn't mean ads are 
going to disappear from the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's policy has ignited a debate in the film industry -- one that has set 
Disney apart from the seven other major studios, divided the ranks of movie 
chain operators between those who show ads and those who don't and set up a 
gray area for the theaters that will continue to show ads, but only in front of 
non-Disney movies. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the exceptions to the Disney rule, like slides that are 
projected on screens before the lights go down or for theaters which have 
pre-existing advertising contracts that must run their course. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond those, there is the question of what constitutes an on-screen ad? Are 
they the slides shown on screens before the lights go down? The spots for 
Coca-Cola or the Los Angeles Times that precede a feature film? The previews of 
coming attractions? The casually placed Sony TV or Chevrolet Camaro or trip to 
Walt Disney World that may find their way into the storyline of a movie? 
</P>
<P>
One theater chain representative, speaking on the condition that he not be 
named, asked: "Where do you draw the line? If you restrict ads from the screen, 
do you also restrict ads in the lobbies? And what about those subtle plugs you 
see for products in the movies themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, makes a 
distinction between ads for products and ads for other movies -- usually known 
as trailers or previews. "Audiences want to see trailers. It's a welcome 
addition to the experience," he said. "(The difference is) you're talking about 
motion pictures to moviegoers." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said his office received "hundreds and hundreds" of calls and letters of 
support from the ticket-buying public in the days after Disney announced the 
new policy to exhibitors gathered last month in Las Vegas for the ShoWest 
convention. "We had five boxloads of letters," said Cook, adding that all you 
have to do to gauge an audience's feelings about ads is to sit in a theater 
with them and listen to them hiss. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is in a strong position right now to enforce its policy, exhibitors and 
others in the business agree. The studio has an apparently strong slate of 
upcoming films, and commercials were only being shown in about half of the 
nation's estimated 23,000 first-run theaters anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the huge public support for Disney's position, the studio isn't 
exactly leading a charge. None of the other seven major studios has spoken out 
against in-theater advertising, and when contacted by The Times for this story, 
none was anxious to throw in with Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"I applaud (the policy) as a consumer," said 20th Century Fox marketing and 
distribution chief Tom Sherak. "But it's not up to me to tell them (theater 
owners) that they should or shouldn't do it. It has to come from the patronage. 
Exhibitors should sit in their theaters and see what the public sees. They 
might see that they might be hurting themselves in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
Cook says the realities of the market will ultimately determine the fate of 
screen advertising. With theater admissions relatively static for the last 10 
years, it cannot afford to risk erosion by giving them something they clearly 
don't want. In some parts of the country, he says, audiences are having to sit 
through 8 to 10 minutes of commercials before the feature begins. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some of Disney's distribution rivals call the no-ads policy a 
blatant public relations ploy. The move was also seen by some industry 
observers as a well-aimed volley in Disney's increasingly public feud with 
MCA-Universal. 
</P>
<P>
MCA owns a 50% non-controlling interest in Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon, the 
second-largest theater chain in North America. In most of its 1,930 theaters, 
the chain shows commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Mira Clodman, Cineplex vice president of corporate communications, confirmed 
that among the ads shown on Cineplex screens -- even those showing Disney 
movies -- are those for the relatively new Universal Studios Florida theme 
park, a direct rival to the nearby Walt Disney World complex. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, in response to a question about the timing of the Disney policy, said, 
"The impetus was not any one ad in particular." He said it is the concept of 
screen advertising that is the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The lone exception to Disney's policy is the use of slide ads shown during 
intermissions. In addition to plugs for the local car wash and video store, the 
"pre-screening" slides include public service announcements, trivia games and 
promotions. Cook says Disney's policy doesn't kick in until the lights go down 
and the movie-going experience begins, so slides are fine. 
</P>
<P>
Because of pre-existing contracts, some people seeing "Pretty Woman" over the 
weekend may have seen commercials. Disney could not say how many of the 1,325 
theaters where "Pretty Woman" is booked had such contracts. But when those 
contracts expire, it's a new, commercial-free game in Disney's world. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the nation's largest theater chain, the 2,700-screen Denver-based 
United Artists Theater Circuit, announced it will go along with the Disney 
advertising ban, but only on the screens where Disney films are shown. 
</P>
<P>
As for the bulk of the United Artist theaters where Disney films are not shown, 
John Neal, vice president of communications for parent company United Artists 
Entertainment, said the theaters will continue to show ads for Coca-Cola, which 
it has been running since January. The United Artist chain, which sells Coke 
products, and the soft drink maker have an advertising arrangement, and the 
Coke ads are the only ones that United Artist theaters show on a national 
basis. However, Neal added, local United Artist managers may make private 
contracts for local advertising, such as with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after the Disney announcement, Cook confirmed that he met with 
representatives of the Los Angeles Times about the newspaper's on-screen 
promotions that are shown on about 1,000 screens throughout Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. Cook said a Times request for an exception was denied. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make exceptions. We're not talking about the quality of commercials, 
rather the idea of having the commercials in front of movies." 
</P>
<P>
Cook notes that longstanding contracts between The Times and theater chains 
will keep the newspaper's ads on many screens where Disney films are shown for 
the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
The Times and theaters have had an arrangement for years -- 40 years in some 
cases -- that provides theater owners with a discount on the rates they pay for 
movie listings. Unnamed chain sources were quoted in a recent Daily Variety 
story estimating their savings from the Times trade-out at about $2 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A Times spokeswoman, Donna Freed, confirmed that the newspaper had sought an 
exception from Disney for the 30-second ads. "We feel the trailers are in 
keeping with the entertainment. It's not a hard sell," Freed added.

RON HOWARD'S MOVING TRIBUTE TO FAMILYHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was, appropriately enough, a family affair for "Parenthood" director Ron 
Howard, honored Friday night at the annual Moving Picture Ball. 
</P>
<P>
Not only were his parents on hand to pay tribute to the still-boyish Howard (a 
father of four), but his television mother and father -- "Happy Days" stars Tom 
Bosley and Marion Ross -- were there to praise Howard as well. 
</P>
<P>
"You did such a good job with him," Ross called across the room to Howard's 
real-life mom, Jean. "It's been a pleasure to be your mother, Ron, even if it's 
just on TV." 
</P>
<P>
And in his acceptance speech, Howard thanked all the members of his family and 
also members of his on-screen family who helped him develop an early aspiration 
for filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks, Andy, for creating an environment where kids were encouraged . . . it 
was a great show to grow up on," Howard said, referring to "The Andy Griffith 
Show." "I can't help feeling incredibly lucky to be able to grow up in this 
business and to be able to live out my dream." 
</P>
<P>
Howard said he decided at age 7 that he wanted to be a film director. Actually, 
he aspired to be a filmmaking hyphenate, with a few additions to the usual 
list: "I wanted to be an actor-director-writer-producer-cameraman and baseball 
player." 
</P>
<P>
The Moving Picture Ball's board of directors -- a group of filmmakers that 
include Martin Scorsese, Sidney Pollack, George Lucas and Francis Coppola -- 
give their American Cinematheque Award to the person seen as the year's hot 
young talent, "an extraordinary artist currently making a significant 
contribution to the art of the moving picture." The unassuming Howard seemed 
more than a little surprised to be given the award so early in his directing 
career. (Past winners have included such other Wunderkinds as Steven Spielberg, 
Robin Williams, Bette Midler and Eddie Murphy.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think of this as an ideal time in my career to stop and look back," 
Howard said in an interview before the show. "I'm trying to move forward." He 
likened the event to a "giant surprise party: It runs a little counter to my 
personality." But, he quickly added that "it's a nice idea that they have to 
honor people who are mid-stride." 
</P>
<P>
The ball's organizers have clearly been impressed by the 36-year-old Howard's 
roster of directorial credits, which include "Nightshift," "Cocoon" and 
"Splash." 
</P>
<P>
The event, which raises money for the nonprofit American Cinematheque, drew a 
crowd of 1,200 to the Century Plaza. Those who attended paid anywhere from $300 
to $700 each, contributing to a total of $350,000 for the organization, which 
is dedicated to the "celebration of the moving picture in all its forms" and is 
currently building an arts complex in Hollywood scheduled to open in mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
At times the grown-up Howard seemed more like the young Opie Taylor, his face 
almost childlike as he took in the show, produced by Henry Winkler and directed 
by Spike Jones Jr. Among the highlights were a hilarious tribute from Steve 
Martin and taped segments from comedians Martin Short and Dana Carvey (as 
President Bush), the glowing accolades of Jessica Tandy and George Lucas, and 
the loving testimonies from Howard's real-life mother Jean, actor-brother Clint 
and wife Cheryl (who finished off her emotion-laden speech with: "No matter how 
much hair you lose, I'll always be proud of you, honey.") 
</P>
<P>
Howard seemed almost transfixed when the USC marching band, in full regalia, 
was brought in to play "76 Trombones" from the score of "The Music Man," in 
which 8-year-old Howard played the adorable little brother of the film's 
librarian, Shirley Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Both Opie and "Happy Days' " Richie Cunningham might have judged the evening's 
highlight to be the presentation of an autographed baseball from one of 
Howard's longtime heroes, former Dodger Sandy Koufax. The inscription read: 
"Opie's come a long way. Congratulations and Best Wishes."

Ivana Trump asked a court today to declare that she is entitled to half of her 
husband Donald's estimated $5-billion fortune, but her lawyers said she is not 
seeking a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kennedy, Ivana Trump's attorney, told a news conference, "This is not 
an action for either divorce or separation. Mrs. Trump remains committed to her 
marriage and her family. 
</P>
<P>
This is an action to obtain rights to half the fortune which the Trumps built 
together during the course of their 13-year-marriage." 
</P>
<P>
A 24-page complaint was filed with New York State Supreme Court against Donald 
Trump, the real estate magnate whose marital problems have been the talk of New 
York for the past month. He has allegedly been linked with an actress named 
Marla Maples but has not sought a divorce or separation from his wife.

Authorities today are seeking the identity of those responsible for 
distributing hundreds of anti-Semitic flyers with a "Kill Every Jew" message 
found near a Yorba Linda synagogue and a Protestant church over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The flyers were found Sunday morning littering the neighborhood surrounding the 
Chabad Center of North County, an ultra-Orthodox synagogue, and the Yorba Linda 
United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
Police and church officials said this morning the flyers were "falsely and 
fraudulently" attributed to the "Methodist fellowship." 
</P>
<P>
"They were probably seeking credibility," said Brea police Lt. Tom Christian. 
"They were probably trying to give somebody reason to think that they should 
read it." 
</P>
<P>
Church and synagogue officials condemned the flyers after a meeting today at 
the Chabad Center. "This is a non-event," said Rabbi David Eliezrie. "One 
person must have photocopied a piece of paper. . . . It is not a problem for 
ourselves or our sister community." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Kenneth Criswell, pastor at the United Methodist Church, called the 
flyers "terrible and cruel."

The center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum, an anti-communist party launched 
by dissidents 18 months ago, emerged the apparent winner in the nation's first 
free multi-party elections in more than four decades, returns showed today. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in the first round of parliamentary elections Sunday rejected the 
old-line Communist Party, which received little more than 3% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Socialist Party, consisting of the bulk of the former Communist 
Party and renamed and reoriented last fall on a parliamentary pro-democracy 
line, did only a little better with about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
With 54% of the votes counted for the 152 county seats, the Forum garnered 
24.53%, followed by its chief rival, the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats 
with 20.63%. 
</P>
<P>
The old Hungarian Socialist Workers Party -- consisting of the unrepentant 
communists -- held 3.69%, an indication that it may not even be represented in 
the Parliament it totally controlled for decades. The cutoff for a party to be 
represented in Parliament is 4%.

NO BILLION FOR PENTAGON: SASSER

The chairman of a Senate panel on military construction said today that a Bush 
Administration request for $1.1 billion to renovate the Pentagon is "out of the 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. James Sasser (D-Tenn.) acknowledged that the 47-year-old building is in 
need of repair but said the Administration's call for $1.1 billion over seven 
years would be difficult to heed in a time of shrinking budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"The military construction bill is going to get smaller not larger," Sasser 
told Pentagon officials at a Senate hearing. "There's simply no room for such 
an undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military construction 
faulted past defense secretaries for failing to get the General Services 
Administration to provide sufficient funds for the building's upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not persuaded that we ought to ask the taxpayers to come up with another 
billion dollars to provide new office space for those who work in the Pentagon 
and to expand it," Sasser said. "Perhaps it's time to take a hard look at 
scaling back some of the Pentagon staff."

A man convicted of raping and sexually mutilating a 7-year-old boy was 
sentenced today to more than 130 years in prison, three times the standard term 
for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Earl Shriner, Pierce County Superior Court Judge Thomas R. 
Sauriol said the case left him more troubled and outraged than any in his 
37-year legal career. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that I have ever heard of a case that borders on extreme cruelty 
more than this one," Sauriol said. 
</P>
<P>
Shriner, 40, has a long history of violence toward young people. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted Feb. 7 of first degree attempted murder, two counts of 
first-degree rape and first-degree assault. The child was choked and sexually 
mutilated in the attack May 20 in a wooded area near his south Tacoma home. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother has said her son continues with his recovery, including 
reconstructive surgery. A trust fund of hundreds of thousands of dollars that 
poured in after the attack on the boy is paying for the surgery.

Former world champion Anatoly Karpov won the World Candidates chess final today 
by beating Dutchman Jan Timman, earning the right to a world championship 
rematch with fellow Soviet Gary Kasparov. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million championship match, the fifth between the archrival grandmasters 
in six years, will be held in New York in October. 
</P>
<P>
Timman resigned after 56 moves in the ninth game, which grandmasters and chess 
experts said was the best game of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The victory put Karpov in a jubilant mood and not only because the Soviet 
grandmaster earned the lion's share of the $250,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to win so easily," Karpov said. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov and Kasparov last locked horns in a two-month duel in Seville, Spain, 
that ended with Kasparov retaining the world title he had seized from Karpov in 
1986.

East Germany today dropped plans to try disgraced former Communist leader Erich 
Honecker and three other ousted officials for high treason, saying there is no 
legal basis for the charges. 
</P>
<P>
However, the chief prosecutor's office said the ailing Honecker and two of the 
officials remain under investigation on suspicion of massive corruption and 
abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, and the three other top Communist officials were members of the 
ruling hard-line Politburo toppled in last fall's peaceful revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had said earlier that Honecker, former state security chief Erich 
Mielke, former economics czar Guenther Mittag and ex-propaganda chief Joachim 
Herrmann would be indicted and put on trial this month.

Sales of existing homes retreated in February for the second-straight month, 
falling 2.3%, but buyer demand remained strong despite rising mortgage rates, a 
real estate trade group said today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said sales of single-family homes at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate totaled 3.44 million in February, down from 
January's pace of 3.52 million. 
</P>
<P>
The February rate was down 3.1% from the February, 1989, rate of 3.55 million 
units. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of persistently rising mortgage rates, a pace of 3.44 million units 
shows considerable market strength," Norman Flynn, NAR president, said.

Japan, in a letter to U.S. trade negotiators, said the United States should 
limit credit card ownership, raise the gasoline tax, impose a federal sales tax 
and scrap the income tax deduction on home mortgages, Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's 
largest daily newspaper, reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, written by the Japanese government, listed 80 steps the United 
States could take to improve its economy, cut spending, increase savings and 
help reduce the trade deficit, according to the newspaper, which obtained a 
copy of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials refused to confirm details of the letter but said it is part 
of the ongoing U.S.-Japanese trade talks aimed at identifying the causes of the 
U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which has been hovering around $50 billion a 
year for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"In the process of negotiation, both parties have proposed various ideas for 
structural improvements, but in concrete terms, we are not going to make any 
comment," said a Foreign Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has drawn up its own list of more than 200 proposals on how 
Japan can reform its economy to make it more open to U.S. imports, according to 
a report last week in another newspaper, Asahi Shimbun. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans suggested that Japan take steps to increase public works 
spending, break up business monopolies, bring down land prices and streamline 
the process for opening retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's suggestions to the United States, according to the newspaper, included: 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the number of credit cards one person can own to reduce consumer 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
* Abolish the income tax deduction on home mortgages, which the Japanese say 
encourages spending not saving. 
</P>
<P>
* Construct a network of high-speed public railways to reduce energy 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
* Enact a federal value-added tax, a sales tax paid by manufacturers and 
merchants, to help reduce the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
* Increase the federal gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
* Amend the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act so that any year the budget 
reduction target is not met, 120% of the portion not met must be trimmed from 
the next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
* Introduce a system of tax-free employee savings. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu have said the far-reaching 
trade negotiations are a two-way street and an opportunity for both sides to 
improve their economic systems.

S&amp;L '89 RED INK HITS RECORD $19.2 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
THIFT INDUSTRY: MOST LOSSES OCCURRED IN INSTITUTIONS ALREADY TAKEN OVER OR 
TARGETED FOR GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER.

<P>
The nation's savings and loans lost $19.2 billion in 1989, the worst 
performance ever and the third consecutive record, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
With a $6.5-billion loss in the final three months of the year, red ink for all 
of 1989 easily topped the previous record of $13.4 billion in 1988. That had 
topped what was then a record of $7.8 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But James Freund, acting chief economist of the Office of Thrift Supervision, 
offered a glimmer of hope for this year, pointing out that the bulk of the 
losses occurred at institutions either taken over by the government or targeted 
for takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"I would presume by this time next year . . . the industry would be smaller and 
the losses would be smaller," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, for instance, the 485 institutions either under 
government control or targeted for government control compiled all the 
industry's losses while the rest of the industry, 2,393 S&amp;Ls, actually 
posted a slight profit of $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
The government's numbers also revealed the cost of the government's slow start 
in shutting down failed institutions. Losses on operations for the 485 totaled 
$2.6 billion in the October-December period -- an average loss of $29 million a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Once these institutions are shut down or sold, the industry will no longer have 
to absorb that continuing expense. Since August, the government has disposed of 
52 S&amp;Ls and announced plans recently to close or sell another 140 by the 
end of June. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift industry deposits totaled $946 billion at the end of 1989, down $26 
billion from a year earlier. Most of the shrinkage occurred as institutions 
sold off assets in order to meet tough new financial standards enacted last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The number of institutions open -- both failed and solvent -- totaled 2,878, 
down from 2,949 a year ago and from a peak of 3,246 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"1989 was clearly a year of substantial change and retrenchment for the thrift 
industry," Freund said.

AVON ACCEDES TO CHARTWELL IN PROXY FIGHT ON BOARD

<P>
Avon Products Inc., the embattled cosmetics giant that has been trying to fight 
off uninvited overtures, said today that it has agreed to nominate two 
directors proposed by unwanted suitor Chartwell Associates LP to its board. 
</P>
<P>
Chartwell, an investment group that includes much smaller rival Mary Kay 
Cosmetics, oil heir Gordon Getty and the Fisher real estate family of New York, 
previously said it would make a bid for Avon if the group's candidates were 
elected to Avon's board. 
</P>
<P>
Chartwell Associates owns about 7.5% of Avon's voting shares and about 9.9% of 
Avon's common. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Avon said it settled the proxy contest initiated by Chartwell by 
agreeing to nominate the two directors proposed by Chartwell as well as two 
incumbent Avon directors to Avon's board at its annual meeting May 3. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, John Rochon will resign as vice chairman of Mary Kay 
and become a consultant to Avon. 
</P>
<P>
Avon also said it will establish a committee to consider alternatives to 
maximize shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
The special committee will consist of James Preston, Avon's chairman and chief 
executive, three incumbent members of Avon's board and the two Chartwell 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
The Chartwell candidates are M. Anthony Fisher of the Fisher real estate family 
and Marc Leland, representing the Getty interests. 
</P>
<P>
Avon incumbents and candidates are Preston and Charles Locke, chairman of 
Morton International Inc. Avon directors not standing for reelection are Emil 
Mosbacher, an investor and independent oil and gas producer, and Merlin Nelson, 
former vice chairman of AMF Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Avon has been trying to fend off uninvited callers since last spring, when 
Amway Inc. offered $2 billion for the company.

The street outside was in the nation's capital but inside it was all country, 
with President and Mrs. Bush attending the annual Ford's Theatre gala Sunday 
night, an event with a decidedly down-home beat from their home state of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Actors John Forsythe and Valerie Harper were co-hosts for the annual 
fund-raiser, which each year raises money for new productions launched at the 
historic theater. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's entertainment featured some of country music's best, including 
Texas' own Tanya Tucker and the Gatlin Brothers. Country star Roy Clark, 
Broadway's Tommy Tune -- who also hails from the Lone Star state -- jazz singer 
Diane Schuur and Tony Bennett rounded out the musical entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Comic relief came in the form of Jim Morris, who did an on-the-mark 
impersonation of the President, opening with the line, "Read my lips, no more 
broccoli," and proceeding to an explanation of why the invasion of Panama was 
called "Operation Just Cause." 
</P>
<P>
"People asked me why I called it 'Just Cause,' " said Morris in a breathy, 
Bush-like voice. "I said just 'cause I liked it."

'LETTICE AND LOVAGE' MAKES FOR A MERRY EVENING

<P>
Fustian House in Wiltshire is the dullest stately home in England. Nothing 
interesting has happened there for the last 400 years. So what is a poor tour 
guide to do? 
</P>
<P>
Make up an interesting history for the old place, says Lettice Douffet, a lady 
as eccentric and exotic as her name. Her embellishments set in motion "Lettice 
and Lovage," Peter Shaffer's enormously entertaining comedy about the unlikely 
friendship between two very different women. 
</P>
<P>
And when the women are played by such accomplished actresses as Maggie Smith as 
the over-imaginative tour guide and Margaret Tyzack as her frustrated boss, it 
makes for a merry evening indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Lettice and Lovage," a big London hit, opened Sunday night at Broadway's Ethel 
Barrymore Theater, where the play should run for as long as Smith wants to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Tyzack is a worthy foil for the extravagant Smith. Bette Henritze also scores 
as Lotte's dithering secretary. But there's no doubt that "Lettice and Lovage" 
really belongs to Smith, and she revels in its glorious excesses. It's a 
perfect marriage of star and story. 
</P>
<P>
What other critics said: 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rich, New York Times: "This is idiosyncratic theater acting of a high and 
endangered order, not to be confused with the actress' tightly minimalistic 
film work. If 'Lettice and Lovage' is but a modest excuse for it, what theater 
lover needs any excuse whatsoever to have a rare reunion with Maggie Smith?" 
</P>
<P>
Howard Kissel, Daily News: "At heart, the play is a celebration of the 
imagination . . . . With these celebrants, there's great cause for rejoicing." 
</P>
<P>
Clive Barnes, New York Post: "This is no mere one-woman triumph. Playwright 
Peter Shaffer and his director, Michael Blakemore, have conspired with 
actresses, the ebulliently bewitching Smith and a queen of more stately 
necromancy, Margaret Tyzack, to produce an evening of enchantment and delight."

Indiana state police headed for Elko today to take into custody a murder 
suspect who was turned in by viewers of the television show "America's Most 
Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana State Police Sgt. Jerry Parker said several viewers of Sunday night's 
episode profiling the crime called in to the show to say that suspect Joey 
Higgins, 28, was working at a tire store in Elko. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins, who used to live in Portage, Ind., was arrested by Elko police at his 
home without incident, according to Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins is wanted in connection with the Jan. 9, 1988, murder of an Iowa man 
who had been hitchhiking. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's profile of the crime was the third time the case had aired on 
the television show.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: 'RAPE' IN DENTIST'S OFFICE IS MORE LIKELY MERE FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I don't know whether my mind has played a trick on me or whether I 
was raped. 
</P>
<P>
I have known my dentist for over 10 years. He is in his 60s, very professional, 
and I always thought he was a gentleman. But last month something happened to 
make me question this. 
</P>
<P>
I had to have oral surgery and he gave me an IV sedative. The procedure was 
done in his office with the door open and the hygienist assisting, but I am 
sure I was sexually assaulted during the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
I asked the hygienist whether she ever left the room and she insisted she was 
there the whole time. She reassured me that nothing happened and that the 
medicine could have made me imagine it. 
</P>
<P>
Can a sedative do that? The experience seemed so real, but I don't want to 
accuse my dentist of rape if it was all in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We don't doubt that there have been instances when an unethical health 
professional has taken unfair advantage of a sedated patient. Don't assume, 
however, that your dentist is at fault. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence is mounting that intravenous sedation with benzodiazepines may induce 
sexual fantasies, including disturbing situations like the one you describe. 
One woman even took her dentist to court, despite the fact that her husband had 
been standing next to her throughout the procedure. The husband testified on 
the dentist's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone undergoing a procedure that requires intravenous sedation should insist 
on having a third person in the room at all times. 
</P>
<P>
With the hygienist present and the door open, it is very unlikely that your 
dentist engaged in any misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What can you tell me about "Guarana," the concentrated energizer? It is sold 
in health food stores as an herb for energy, mental alertness and as an 
appetite suppressant. 
</P>
<P>
A. Guarana comes from the crushed seeds of a Brazilian shrub. Although it has a 
reputation as an appetite suppressant, aphrodisiac and a stimulant, its active 
ingredient is no more mysterious than caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
It contains 3% to 5% caffeine, about twice as much as coffee.

BLOOD IN the streets? This is how Hollywood proper is characterizing the new 
amalgamation of Frank Price with Jon Peters and Peter Guber at Columbia 
Pictures. "Can you imagine a man like Price, already a success in his own right 
as the one-time head of Columbia in the good old days -- can you imagine him 
reporting to a volatile person like Jon Peters?" 
</P>
<P>
On this, the day of the Academy Awards, Hollywood is talk, talk, talking. 
Another exec says: "Let's see, this would make a marriage of arrogance -- the 
arrogance of Frank Price matched with that of Jon Peters. They'll never get 
along." (Peter Guber, we should add, seems to figure mostly behind the scenes 
in these imagined conflicts, because he is considered such an extremely passive 
person; one who uses Jon Peters as his top gun.) 
</P>
<P>
I suppose Frank Price must surely be smart enough to have ironclad stuff in his 
new contract with Guber and Peters assuring his being able to work with them 
and not find them too onerous. "How?" asks one wise-acre. "They are still going 
to be his bosses and and Frank Price isn't used to being bossed or 
second-guessed." 
</P>
<P>
And -- the latest hot skinny out of L.A. -- despite denials to the contrary -- 
is that Sony itself is now looking somewhat askance at this incredible deal 
they have made with Guber and Peters. It cost Sony something like $700 million 
right up front. It is estimated it could cost them billions more in the long 
run, for no one has ever seen anything like the way Guber and Peters like to 
spend other people's money. And now it is obvious that the unprecedented Guber 
and Peters deal with Sony threw the entire Hollywood money factor out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
Jealousy, envy, gnashing of teeth ensued, with subsequent misery for agents, 
producers, studio executives. The deal ended with a fallout that has sent costs 
soaring all down the movie world's line. 
</P>
<P>
Question -- did Jon Peters really use a company plane to woo a new girlfriend 
in London with $300,000 worth of fresh flowers? Oh, how can we even dignify 
this one with a question mark. I hereby deny it. Jon Peters wouldn't do 
anything like that. And to ask him would mean we'd have to climb all the way up 
where he now dwells, like Jove, among his zaps and thunderbolts. That's not for 
mere mortals.

MARY TYLER MOORE became the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's "Woman of the

Asner, Betty White, Nancy Walker, Eileen Heckert, Cloris Leachman, Gavin 
MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
Only Valerie Harper and Georgia Engel were among the missing, both with 
pressing commitments elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mary flew down from Canada for the night and she looked dazzling in a red, 
off-the-shoulder Scaasi gown. She has been been filming "The Last Best Year of 
My Life," an NBC-TV movie to be seen next fall, co-starring Bernadette Peters.

Former President Nixon said he expects historians to judge him more by 
Watergate than by his diplomatic overtures to China. 
</P>
<P>
"Historians are more likely to lead with 'He resigned the office,' " Nixon said 
in an interview in the latest issue of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury has already come in, and there's nothing that's going to change it. 
There's no appeal. Historians will judge it harshly." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon discussed the Watergate break-in in his new book "In the Arena," 
excerpted in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The former President said that he made the "inexcusable error" of asking the 
CIA to block an FBI investigation of the Watergate break-in, but that the CIA 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said a decision by then-CIA Director Richard Helms and his deputy, Vernon 
Walters, to ignore the request discredits Watergate's "most serious myth -- the 
one that ultimately forced me to resign:" that the CIA, in fact, obstructed the 
FBI investigation on his orders.

DRESDEN, East Germany

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Germany was reunited Monday, at least on the soccer field, when former World 
Cup players from East and West Germany played on the same team in a charity 
match. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since the postwar division of Germany that a united 
soccer team from the two German states played together. 
</P>
<P>
A team of former World Cup stars from other nations beat the Germans 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The match brought together such World Cup stars as Franz Beckenbauer and 
Karl-Heinz Rummenigge of West Germany, Brazil's Jairzinho, Bobby Moore and 
Bobby Charlton of England, Juanito of Spain and Alain Giresse of France. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, Rummenigge, Paul Breitner, Uli Hoennes, Wolfgang Overath and Uwe 
Seeler from the 1974 West German World Cup team, for this occasion, were 
teammates of one-time adversary Juergen Sparwasser. 
</P>
<P>
Sparwasser became a hero in East Germany when he scored the goal in a 1-0 
victory over West Germany in 1974.

REBEL COACH HAS HIS EYE ON TITLE;

BASKETBALL: UNLV'S TARKANIAN SEES 'A LEGITIMATE CHANCE' AFTER HIS TEAM DISPOSED 
OF LOYOLA MARYMOUNT TO ADVANCE TO THE FINAL FOUR.

<P>
The UNLV Runnin' Rebels, fresh from an "awesome" win over Loyola Marymount, 
have a "legitimate chance" to win a coveted national title that has long-eluded 
them, coach Jerry Tarkanian believes. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we really have a legitimate chance," Tarkanian said, wandering in a 
daze through an airport lobby jammed with thousands of boisterous fans. 
</P>
<P>
"They were so awesome, they were just beautiful," Tarkanian said, hours after 
his club had disposed of Loyola Marymount, 131-101, to advance to college 
basketball's Final Four for the second time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, whose No. 2-ranked Rebels carry a 33-5 mark into Saturday's match-up 
with Georgia Tech, was already starting to fret about the Yellow Jackets. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got three great, great players, and they've got two good kids inside," 
Tarkanian said of Tech, a 93-91 winner over Minnesota Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tech's "three great, great players" -- Kenny Anderson, Dennis Scott and Brian 
Oliver -- have been dubbed Lethal Weapon 3, a play on the popular movie. The 
trio scored 89 of Tech's 93 points Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, in particular, bothers Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
"He's practically impossible to pressure," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their press will be one of the toughest problems for us to handle," Tarkanian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, walking down a concourse at McCarran International Airport jammed 
with thousands of chanting fans, turned around and began walking backward, 
watching the mob engulf his players who had trailed him off the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"We were good today, weren't we?" Tarkanian said, a smile creasing his usually 
somber face. "We were just awesome. The kids played just the way we wanted them 
to play. They were so focused." 
</P>
<P>
Do his Rebels have what it takes to win it all after trips to the Final Four in 
1977 and 1987? They lost both times in the opening game. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope so, I really hope so." 
</P>
<P>
Can they maintain the intensity that transformed Sunday's predicted dogfight 
into a rout? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I just don't know. I hope so. The kids are really focused right 
now. They're playing their hearts out." 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing harder than we've played all season," said Larry Johnson as 
autograph seekers shoved dollar bills, scraps of paper and Rebel memorabilia at 
the all-America forward. "But every one's going to be tough from here on. 
There's so much luck involved now. We're just going to take it game by game. 
We're just going to play our hearts out." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the Rebels' do-it-all star, will need help from the outside at Denver. 
He didn't get it Friday night and the Rebels escaped with a 69-67 victory over 
unheralded Ball State that went down to the final second. 
</P>
<P>
They did get it Sunday with guards Anderson Hunt scoring 30 points, Greg 
Anthony 21 and Stacey Cvijanovich getting 10. Stacey Augmon hit 33 and Johnson 
added 20. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian had been hounding Augmon, the club's top defense player and a member 
of the Olympic team, to kick it up a notch in practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
He played a major role in the semifinals at Oakland, hitting clutch baskets 
each time Ball State and Loyola Marymount would make a run at the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
At the airport Sunday night, Anthony was surrounded by a cluster of fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We played the game we wanted," he said. "We broke their press and we played 
good defense." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech will pose some major problems, Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're great on the perimeter and they're great inside," he said. "I think 
it's going to be a great game." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, who played the final third of the season with his jaw wired shut after 
breaking it in two places while driving for a basket, said the reward had been 
worth the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long year," he sighed, signing the T-shirt of a teen-ager. "But we 
persevered. Today made it all worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels played two-thirds of their season with one or more players out of 
the lineup because of injuries, illness, academics or a series of suspensions 
by the NCAA for failure to pay incidental bills at hotels where the team stayed 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Two players were also suspended, one for one game and one for three, because of 
a fight after the Utah State game here last month. Seven UNLV players and three 
from Utah State were placed on probation for the remainder of the season by the 
Big West Conference because of the fight.

WINFIELD DENIES TRADE RUMOR

New York Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield, who missed all of last season because 
of back surgery, fielded questions Sunday about reports that he may be traded 
to the Angels for pitcher Mike Witt. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees have had talks with the Angels about Witt, 9-15 with a 4.54 ERA 
last season, but they deny Winfield is involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about that," principal owner George Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't just trade me," Winfield said. "I have rights, and no one has said 
anything to me." As a player with 10 or more years in the majors and five or 
more with the same club, Winfield may veto any trade. His home is in Beverly 
Hills, so there is speculation that Winfield might accept a trade to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't comment because people will read too much into it," he said. "Any 
decisions have to come between George and me. Other than Jackie Robinson, I 
don't know a player who has been badgered more than me. I'm not going to let 
anything distract me from my comeback trail."

The bell had just started for the beginning of the third and final round when 
boxer Geoff McCreesh saw another fight erupt just outside the ring. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't resist it. 
</P>
<P>
McCreesh leaped into the front row of the seats to join in the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a disturbance going on in the crowd and the next thing, he just 
dived straight over the ropes and into the public at ringside," said Peter 
Blenkinsopp, secretary of the Midlands division of Britain's Amateur Boxing 
Association. "I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
ABA officials began an investigation Monday into what prompted the second 
unconventional conclusion to a British bout in six months. 
</P>
<P>
In September, professional light-heavyweight Steve McCarthy was floored by the 
mother of opponent Tony Wilson. Minna Wilson climbed into the ring during the 
third round and clobbered McCarthy with her high-heeled shoe. The fighter need 
three head stitches. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's incident at Longbridge, a suburb of this English midlands town, 
McCreesh was quickly grabbed by his cornermen after abandoning his amateur 
welterweight fight, a national semifinal, against Robert McCracken. 
</P>
<P>
He was ushered back into the ring but the damage was done. McCreesh was 
disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said the crowd disturbance may have involved McCreesh's 
father and supporters of McCracken, a local Birmingham fighter. Officials said 
that whoever caused it, McCreesh was still out of order. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it was anybody's fault, but I would blame the boy for leaving, 
whatever the provocation," Blenkinsopp said. "He should have been sticking to 
his job." 
</P>
<P>
Neither McCreesh nor McCracken were available for comment.

'WASHED UP?' REUSCHEL SAYS 'HA!'

<P>
Rick Reuschel, the 40-year-old Opening Day starting pitcher for the San 
Francisco Giants, has been hearing three of the nastiest words in baseball for 
nine springs now: 
</P>
<P>
"He's washed up." 
</P>
<P>
That's what "they" have said since Reuschel underwent rotator cuff surgery 
before the 1982 season. Reuschel figures that maybe next year or the year 
after, "they" will be right. 
</P>
<P>
"Except I'm going to trick them," he said. "I'm not going to be here that 
spring when that happens. I can't tell you how I'll know, but I'll know. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I surprise people -- not baseball people, but the press -- by showing 
up every year. And I surprise them again by finishing out the year. To them -- 
not all of them, but some of them -- it's incomprehensible. They don't 
understand how that can be." 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel has won 36 games and been named to the All-Star Team the last two 
seasons. But he hasn't won with power, the way Nolan Ryan does in his 40s. And 
he hasn't won with off-speed stuff, the way Tommy John did in his 40s. 
</P>
<P>
He has won quickly, throwing just 90 to 100 pitches in his better nine-inning 
games. He has won quietly, shunning group interviews and public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
So, much as he hates having to justify his presence in the game each spring, he 
seems to understand why he must continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I even understand why I've been successful, because I don't do 
anything particularly well except throw a lot of strikes and keep my teammates 
in the game," Reuschel said. "It's not attention-getting. It's not flashy. It's 
not 12 or 15 strikeouts a game. It's not 95- and 98-m.p.h. fastballs. That's 
the stuff that people like to write about and see." 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel's teammates, who call him "Big Daddy," like to talk about the example 
he sets and the motivation he inspires. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Jose Alvarez, 33 years old with but only two years in the majors, 
takes comfort in Reuschel's advancing age. 
</P>
<P>
Said Alvarez: "Big Daddy's proved over and over again: It's not age that gets 
people out, it's what you have." 
</P>
<P>
"That's nice of them to say that," Reuschel said. "It doesn't make me feel old. 
I feel old all by myself -- I don't need help. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't worry about it. As long as I'm healthy and can go out there, I 
don't worry about the age. I think health has a lot more to do with it than age 
-- although it gets harder every year to convince people of that. So I don't 
try any more." 
</P>
<P>
The proverbial critic known as "they" kept creeping into Reuschel's 
conversation Sunday, as he took to the stationary bike in preparation for 
today's Cactus League opener against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Without prompting, Reuschel answers the critics who say he's too old or too 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still do the things I need to do, and I work hard at it," said Reuschel, 
who is listed at 240 pounds. "I've definitely slowed down, and I can't do some 
of the things I used to do. As far as the pitching end, I can still do all 
that. I can't run the bases like I used to be able to, and I probably am not as 
good a fielder as I was five-six years ago -- but I think I'm still one of the 
best. And I work hard at it. I do it because it's important to my game to be 
able to help out. 
</P>
<P>
"I play the game for myself and my teammates, and I don't really give a crap 
what anybody else thinks." 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel is such a no-nonsense guy that he would gladly give up the Opening Day 
start scheduled for April 10 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an honor on the one hand and a pain in the rear end on the other," he 
said. "I mean, you never start on time and there's all this other baloney going 
on that tries to take away from your concentration in the game. My druthers: 
Let somebody else deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Roger Craig, however, has not lost an Opening Day as a manager and does 
not intend to take his chances now. Besides, he has noticed that Reuschel looks 
as sharp as he did last spring, before he won 17 games, and the spring before 
that, before he won 19. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel would not predict similar results in 1990. He does, however, predict 
that he'll be back in camp next spring -- trying to justify his presence again 
at age 41. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to try to stay a year ahead of them as far as when I'm going to 
retire," he said. "It wouldn't be before the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, next spring, I'll come in and say that I don't intend to retire after 
this year, but it might be as early as the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come to spring training, my intentions are to play for two more years, 
until I decide to quit. Then, I just won't show up at spring training that 
year."

STALLONE, DEREK, SHATNER TOP THE RASPBERRY AWARDS LIST

<P>
 Sylvester Stallone and Bo Derek were named the worst actors of the '80s and 
William Shatner and his "Star Trek V" were the big losers of 1989 in the 10th 
Annual Golden Raspberry Awards. 
</P>
<P>
"Mommie Dearest" was named worst film of the decade in awards ceremonies Sunday 
at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Razzies, as the awards are known, were bestowed for worst achievement in film 
for both the last year and past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
For 1989, Shatner was named worst actor for "Star Drek V," as the Golden 
Raspberry selectors prefer to call the film. The science-fiction sequel was 
also named as the worst film of 1989 and Shatner as worst director of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Locklear, who starred with Shatner in the television series "T. J. 
Hooker," was also honored with a Razzie as worst actress of 1989 for her work 
in "The Return of Swamp Thing." 
</P>
<P>
Brooke Shields was singled out for worst supporting actress for 1989's "Speed 
Zone," while Christopher Atkins got the Razzie as worst supporting actor for 
last year's "Listen to Me." 
</P>
<P>
"Harlem Nights" took the award for worst screenplay of the year, written by 
Eddie Murphy. The tune "Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter" from "A Nightmare 
on Elm Street 5" was chosen as the worst original song of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the decade competition, Stallone was named as worst actor for his 
appearances in "Rhinestone," "Rambo II," "Rocky IV," "Cobra," "Over the Top," 
"Rambo III," "Lock Up" and "Tango and Cash." 
</P>
<P>
Bo Derek was recognized as worst actress of the '80s for "Tarzan the Ape Man" 
and "Bolero." Pia Zadora was picked as worst new star of the decade for 
"Butterfly" and "The Lonely Lady." 
</P>
<P>
The winners were picked by the more than 275 members of the Golden Raspberry 
Award Foundation. The organization includes film makers, frequent moviegoers 
and movie journalists.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: 'MECHANIC' STRESSES PATIENCE, DISCIPLINE

Fire Back turned out to be the favorite in the second race at Santa Anita Park 
on Feb. 15, when 3-year-olds competed at six furlongs for claiming prices of 
$35,000 to $40,000 and a purse of $21,000. The nag, from the No. 11 post 
position, quickly jumped out of the starting gate into second place but fell 
back to third at the quarter-pole. 
</P>
<P>
Although it seemed as if Fire Back was going to be just another also-ran, since 
horses don't usually come on again after falling behind, something gave the nag 
a second wind. By the half-mile pole, Fire Back was in front by half a length 
and had increased his lead to two lengths by the stretch. At the finish, Fire 
Back was four lengths in front and laughing all the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Back returned $3.60 to win for $2. Although it was a short price, going 
off at 4-5, system players were happy with the result. And no one was happier 
than "The Mechanic," who had lost one race, then started a streak that resulted 
in four more wins for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mechanic" is a big man with extremely wide shoulders, a huge chest, 
totally gray hair, bright-blue eyes, a prominent nose, thick lips and a ruddy 
complexion. Although he is easily recognizable at the track, he is better known 
for his card dealing, his extraordinary ability in playing and his artistic 
talent in marking up a deck of cards so that it is nearly impossible to detect 
the markings. These decks he never uses himself but sells for hundreds of 
dollars to other "mechanics" who work them into their games. 
</P>
<P>
Since "The Mechanic" doesn't begin his real work until about 11 p.m., when 
big-money card games usually start, he attends the races to pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mechanic" finds that watching the ponies run relaxes him. As a result, 
winning is not that important, just as long as the losses aren't huge. He tells 
people: "Don't bet a lot. Don't try to break the track -- just have fun!" 
</P>
<P>
This philosophy resulted in his devising a system, which he started betting at 
least 30 years ago, that works well for him. He bets only on favorites that go 
off at 7-5 or less when the second choice is 3-1 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
To follow this kind of a system, however, means that players must have patience 
and discipline, because such races turn up only about two to four times a day. 
Many times no such race turns up, and "The Mechanic" goes home without making a 
bet. And sometimes only one race presents itself. So waiting and not betting 
very often are the keys. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was an unusual day when "The Mechanic" won five out of six races. 
Here's what the odds were to $1 when Fire Back won: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Believe In Winning $59.10 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Wind 'N Wine 5.40 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Ash Hab 8.10 
</P>
<P>
4 -- High Forest 30.50 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Speed Boat 6.70 
</P>
<P>
6 -- No Doubles Match 12.80 
</P>

</P>
<P>
12 -- Check Collector 17.90 
</P>
<P>
All system players needed to do was scan the totalizator board just before the 
race. Since Fire Back was less than 7-5 in the betting and the second choice, 
Wind 'n Wine, was 3-1 or higher in the odds, Fire Back was the system choice. 
</P>
<P>
In the third race that day, only six horses competed at 1 1/4 miles for 
4-year-olds and up. The favorite was Spirit Bay, which took the lead at the 
three-quarter pole and ended up winning by three lengths. The second choice at 
3-1 was Achirante, enabling "The Mechanic" to bet the race. Spirit Bay paid $4. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mechanic" then won the fourth race with Hat Parade, paying $4.60; the 
eighth race with Opening Verse, $3.40, and the ninth with Aloma's Tobin, which 
paid $4.80. For the day, on $2 betting, "The Mechanic" wagered $12 and returns 
amounted to $20.40. Profit for the day came to $8.40. 
</P>
<P>
Why a favorite of 7-5 wins more often than other favorites when the second 
choice is 3-1 or higher in the same race is anyone's guess. Some experts 
believe that these horses are bet down to such low odds because they are far 
superior to all other horses and the public that wagers on the other ponies in 
the same race are only going for a price. Thus, the horses 3-1 or higher in the 
betting aren't real contenders but only goats out for the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
This season at Santa Anita, for the first 50 days from Dec. 26, 1989, to Feb. 
28, 1990, "The Mechanic" wagered on only 91 races, investing $182 on straight 
$2 bets, and came out about even, losing just 40 cents. And during 13 of the 50 
days there was no betting. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mechanic" admits that varying the system to a money-management progression 
would probably be more fun and a lot more interesting. Any kind of progression 
should work, he says, just as long as the player goes back to the original 
straight bet after a win. 
</P>
<P>
What players get with this sort of system are lots of winners and action for 
the betting that does take place. Of the 91 races "The Mechanic" bet, 46 won, 
for a .505 winning percentage. Of course, higher payoffs would have put system 
players in the black for the period. However, system players will find that the 
highest possible mutual can only be $4.80, while the lowest will be $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
When this is pointed out to "The Mechanic," he only shrugs: "I've been betting 
for many, many years," he says. "Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. It's not 
whether you win or lose the race, but how much fun you get out of it."

A PHOTOGRAPHER WHO DEALS IN PLAIN IMAGES OF THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD

<P>
There is something bizarrely appropriate about interviewing photographer Lewis 
Baltz at an Irvine cafe that consists of four tables facing a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Baltz, 44, is known in international art circles for his crisp, deliberately 
unremarkable images of construction sites, tract houses and industrial parks. 
He is not a photographer in the traditional sense of capturing moments of 
exceptional beauty, power or surprise. Rather, his work is motivated by dual 
interests -- in the powers and limits of photography itself and in the way that 
late 20th-Century industrialism has changed the meaning of landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The morning after his recent lecture at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, Baltz -- 
who shuttles between homes in Sausalito and Milan, Italy -- cuts a cosmopolitan 
figure. Attired in a crisp white shirt, jeans and safari jacket, lighting 
cigarettes in a steady stream, he cradles his far-ranging thoughts in a warmly 
urbane baritone. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Baltz is a native son: He was born and grew up in Newport Beach. A 
clever child, he discovered photography at 11 and promptly lost interest in 
academic matters. ("I only avoided flunking out of Newport Harbor High School 
because they wouldn't flunk anybody.") He became a habitue of Ferris Gallery -- 
the legendary Los Angeles venue for contemporary art -- and gawked at the first 
L.A. show of Andy Warhol's work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure this was the sort of thing my parents would despise; therefore 
there had to be some real value to it," he recalls. "This was one of the most 
alienating environments to grow up in that I can imagine. I remember the social 
atmosphere that was so intensely felt here: the Cold War, McCarthyism. . . . It 
was that general madness of Americans at that period, focused very intensely 
here because of the conservative politics. 
</P>
<P>
"But also there was this sense of explosive change. Everything was being torn 
down. . . . The material culture was shifting very rapidly. And, of course, 
with that comes a real apocalyptic sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I never could put my finger on that until I came back to Los Angeles after 
having been in Milan. And I thought, what was so comforting about living in 
Italy? The Italians, the food, all that, yes. But there was something I found 
very comforting about walking through a 17th-Century city, walking through a 
cathedral that was a kind of Romanesque wedding cake. . . . (Such sights) were 
monuments to the durability of human endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"We say (the redwoods) are our cathedrals. I used to believe that, but I never 
really felt it. And I realized why: Because those things are absolutely 
independent of human existence. It's like making a personal theology based on 
the perfection of the galaxy and finding comfort in that. I think many people 
could, but it's not cultural. 
</P>
<P>
"To climb a hill and see a beautiful redwood tree is not the same as to climb a 
hill and see the ruins of a 5th-Century temple. Nothing remotely to do with us 
had anything to do with (the redwood). Its back is turned to us forever. We can 
regard it or not. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I came back to Los Angeles, I began to have these apocalyptic 
fantasies and dreams. They seemed perfectly logical. I didn't see (Ridley 
Scott's futuristic film) 'Blade Runner' as entertainment; I saw it as prophecy. 
It gave me a vision of California and also a way of making peace with it. . . . 
'Blade Runner' is our destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that everything was built yesterday carries with it the implication 
that it could be destroyed this afternoon. There's nothing you can hold onto. 
</P>
<P>
"There is also the self-absorption, the sense of being in a hall of mirrors. We 
don't have so much to reflect back except ourselves. This is our architecture, 
this is our period, our sensibility. It's very much us. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"We went from bean fields at a flood plain of the Santa Ana River to this very 
complex society that has been built in Irvine -- complex in the sense that it 
is wired into global society -- but in fact, there are already forces at work 
that will completely undo this. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this highway building has, in effect, turned back on itself and become 
a barrier rather than a passageway. There are ecological problems. . . . The 
age of information processing has now become subject to an information glut. . 
. . That's the social reality I perceive." 
</P>
<P>
Baltz's photographs are not made as individual entities but as equal elements 
composing a series. The crisp, simply composed, black-and-white images in his 
earliest monographs, like "The New Industrial Parks Near Irvine, California" 
(1975), are like primers, spelling out "the most generic or common aspects of 
the environment." Beginning with "Park City" (1981), Baltz began to consider 
more deeply the auxiliary changes that occur when people transform the 
landscape for various purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"(If you) start with drywall and cement bags and end up with a house, it is a 
conceptually higher, more complex form of organization. But there is decay, 
destruction and disorganization that takes place almost immediately. The 
entropy machine starts as soon as the organizational machine starts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(My) books show the disorder and physical decay of industrial products as they 
begin to re-merge with nature, raising the question of whether they're natural 
or industrial. You experience nature in my photographs as an industrial 
product." 
</P>
<P>
Baltz remains an observer, however, with no interest in moralizing. This 
neutral outlook "alienates you from every possible political constituency," he 
acknowledges. "The Right doesn't want (the issues) looked at at all, and the 
Left feels it's politically incorrect to (observe) without actually making a 
move to change (anything). The problem I have with that is, how would you 
change it, realistically? What sort of world would you propose?" 
</P>
<P>
The camera offers Baltz an ideal vehicle for looking at signs of industrial 
change. "Photography has a very particular way of dealing with information. . . 
. It tells us things in a different way, if not necessarily different things. . 
. . Still photographs lift something out of the flow of time so we can examine 
it in a way that presumably we always could but never would. 
</P>
<P>
"And because (the photograph) fixes our gaze on something normally seen as a 
passing vision, it alienates us from things. It reverses the poles of the 
familiar and the exotic . . . so we begin to have this familiarity with things 
we've never seen, but also this sense of distancing from what we do see. 
</P>
<P>
"The exotic has never held much interest for me as something to work with, at 
least not yet. But the typical, the familiar, the so-called obvious -- those 
are things that interest me because there's much to them that does not meet the 
eye in observation." 
</P>
<P>
Baltz recently has been working on a series of photographs of the sites of high 
technology, because he is interested in "the perception of the phenomena of 
high technology: What we think it is, and what it actually looks like. When I 
photograph in these locations, the locations all look the same. They're in 
Irvine, Silicon Valley, Marseilles, Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
"They are 'clean rooms,' places where microchip and computer design go on. They 
have the same furnishings. Everything's in English. They look crummy. They look 
identical. There's nothing except a caption to tell you where these were made, 
which I think speaks volumes. 
</P>
<P>
"And the pictures are filled with information, none of which is useful, none of 
which gives the slightest idea, really, of what's going on. They are the most 
extreme illustrations I can think of of the difference between old and new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"(Old) machine technology is a traditional photographic subject," he said. The 
subjects of Paul Strand and other photographers of the 1920s and '30s, "are 
beautiful, Aristotelian machines you can kind of figure out. You can see how 
this (part) turns that (part), and so on. "But you can look at (new technology) 
and not know what it does. It's a special kind of arcane knowledge. There's 
nothing that reveals itself to observation. 
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, this body of work as a procedure (for discovering new 
information) is doomed to fail. I like that idea. . . . In a very, very clear 
way (the project) becomes a treatise on the failure of photographic 
information. . . . I'm always fascinated to come to the end (of such a 
project). It's like the end of the world."

POLITICS: LASZLO TOKES USED HIS ROLE AS A MINISTER TO SPEAK AGAINST THE CORRUPT 
ROMANIAN REGIME. NOW HE SPEAKS ON BEHALF OF ROMANIA'S FLEDGLING DEMOCRACY.

<P>
In a quiet, old-fashioned apartment in the mid-Wilshire district, the preacher 
who sparked the Romanian revolution is taking a break from catching history's 
treacherous waves. 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo Tokes, pale, tired-looking, dark-eyed, seems to fit perfectly with the 
red chintz chairs, dark furniture and portrait miniatures on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
But it's soon clear that Tokes -- cigarette in one hand, coffee cup in the 
other -- is not comfortable in the past or the present, that he may be rushing 
toward the future faster than any media-hyped California trend-setter. 
</P>
<P>
With the ouster and execution of the bizarre and megalomaniacal dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu in December, Tokes was elevated from obscure cleric to 
national hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it changed all of my life," he says. "My faith is the same but I 
could compare it to the relationship between prophecy and realization. . . . I 
did what I did because I believe invisible things can be made real." 
</P>
<P>
Now Tokes, 37, is working on another personal transformation -- becoming a 
globe-trotting spokesman on the problems of embryonic democracy. He is 
chain-smoking his way through a mind-numbing two-week tour of the United States 
and Canada. For instance, he is to be in Los Angeles less than 24 hours, long 
enough to speak to a church gathering, grant a couple of interviews and grab a 
little sleep. Every interview, speech and press conference in his packed 
itinerary is calculated to spotlight the chronic problems of Romania, the 
country that suffered the bloodiest overthrow of Communism in Eastern Europe 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
In these encounters Tokes (pronounced To-kesh) appears to impress. "He's not 
your typical backwoods Romanian preacher," says Steven W. Popper, a RAND Corp. 
specialist in the economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, who met 
privately with Tokes. Popper adds that Tokes is "a very impressive guy" with "a 
fairly healthy sense of his place" in the events that ignited Romania. 
</P>
<P>
One measure of Tokes' new stature is his meeting with President Bush. Tokes, an 
ethnic Hungarian and minister of the Protestant Hungarian Reformed Church, told 
reporters he came away from the March 15 encounter satisfied the United States 
will not grant improved trade status to Romania unless the rights of Hungarians 
and other minorities are protected. He was also scheduled to meet with Canadian 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney last week. 
</P>
<P>
Tokes' emphasis on minority rights highlights the complex issues uncovered in 
the wake of Communism's demise in the former East Bloc. Countries once 
perceived as monolithic totalitarian states are now clearly revealed as welters 
of regional and ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, those tensions flared into hand-to-hand fighting in the town of 
Tirgu Meres, where at least seven people have been killed and hundreds were 
wounded in clashes between ethnic Hungarians and Romanian nationalists, who are 
calling for the expulsion of all minorities. The violence touched off 
diplomatic protests by the United States and Hungary, which called upon Romania 
to protect its ethnic Hungarians -- variously estimated at 1.7 million to 2.5 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
Tokes, son of a minister and one of eight children, began his rise to 
prominence as a voice of this Hungarian minority. And his tour of North America 
is sponsored by the New York-based Hungarian Human Rights Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian church's use of its native language and customs was anathema to 
Ceausescu's regime, and the government pressured the church to install a 
compliant hierarchy. The suppression of the church was part of a wider 
crackdown waged by Ceausescu on the Hungarian population and culture. 
</P>
<P>
But Tokes says his experiences in the revolution broadened his once parochial 
outlook. Now his most urgent role in shaping a free Romania is working for 
reconciliation between warring ethnic factions, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, that won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Tokes reportedly has been warned not to return to Romania, at 
least for now, because of threats on his life and the lives of other Hungarian 
leaders. (Given the volatile state of affairs in Romania, Tokes told a news 
conference in Toronto last Wednesday, he will not return until the government 
there can guarantee his safety. Ironically, some of Tokes' critics lambaste him 
for not being sufficiently anti-communist. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if his past is any indication, Tokes, who says he was called to the 
ministry and that his actions spring from his faith, is not likely to heed the 
danger signals for long. His life was repeatedly threatened in Romania while 
Ceausescu was in power, and he and his family were attacked in their apartment 
by four masked intruders last November. The disguised assailants were driven 
off by Tokes and two visiting friends. After the revolution, Tokes was guarded 
by the army for a time because of fears that die-hard Ceausescu followers would 
assassinate him. 
</P>
<P>
Tokes' rocket-like ascent to prominence began last Dec. 15 when supporters 
ringed his church in Timisoara in an attempt to protect him from arrest by 
Romania's feared secret police, the securitate. As a longtime dissident, Tokes 
was often a target of official harassment from both church leaders and the 
government because he had become a master of publicizing his cause, first the 
preservation of Hungarian culture in the church and later outright opposition 
to the Ceausescu regime. Now officials were trying to remove him from the 
springboard of his dissent, his pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
The defiance by Tokes' followers -- including some members of other churches -- 
was unsuccessful and Tokes, his wife and 3-year-old son were deported to a 
remote village. But the protests in Timisoara grew and on Dec. 17 Ceausescu 
ordered security forces to fire on the crowds, killing as many as 3,500 people, 
according to a U. S. government estimate. As a result, resistance to the regime 
spread throughout the country. Ceausescu was overthrown when the army joined 
the revolt on Dec. 22. On Christmas Day, the new Romanian government announced 
that after a secret trial Ceausescu had been stood against a wall and shot. And 
Tokes, the former enemy of the state, was named to the Council of National 
Salvation, the coalition that now rules uneasily over a still-turbulent 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Tokes has gained some perspective on the events that transformed his 
country and himself. Although his active opposition to the Ceausescu 
dictatorship dates to the early 1980s, Tokes says the final round began in the 
fall, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Tokes went public with his opposition to Ceausescu's plans to 
raze several thousand villages -- including their churches, historic landmarks 
and cemeteries -- and force residents into huge housing developments, thus 
destroying the cultural, spiritual and social fabric of his region of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Tokes, who often notes that the root word of Protestant is protest, wrote and 
circulated a petition protesting the plan. He was placed under close 
surveillance by the securitate and endured continuing harassment, including 
revocation of his ration book. Tokes, however, continued to fight back by 
smuggling messages about his plight out of the country and giving clandestine 
interviews to foreign journalists. (One illustration of the absurdist nature of 
Ceausescu's government is that Tokes reportedly was billed for the threatening 
phone calls made to his home.) 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Tokes freely admits that he did not foresee a revolution. "I 
didn't expect this in such a concrete form," he explains. "I didn't in any case 
think that I would have such a direct role in the fall of the regime. . . . We 
don't choose historical circumstances, rather they chose us and they choose 
(our) historical roles." 
</P>
<P>
But he and supporters had premonitions that "something has to happen in the 
near future because the situation (in Romania) was unsupportable." 
</P>
<P>
Sustained by these cloudy hopes, Tokes says he counted on drawing more and more 
people to the anti-Ceausescu cause. "I knew from day to day, week to week there 
would be more and more people who will stand out, speak out," he says, adding 
in simple understatement, "And so it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview conducted in a mixture of Hungarian and English, Tokes at first 
glosses over his own role. Only when pressed does he detail his carefully 
crafted campaign that mixed religion with an intelligent grasp of how to use 
publicity and the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important was the fact that he was not working in a vacuum. "As a 
dissident only I had public support because I had my congregation," Tokes says. 
"Others were solitary intellectuals, isolated. My luck was that I could not be 
isolated and I could make every Sunday announcements from the pulpit, sometimes 
as long as a sermon. I informed believers what had happened in the previous 
week and my church became a forum of democracy, of publicity. I told them 
everything about the securitate, how many times they have visited, how they 
threatened me." 
</P>
<P>
Tokes also was fortunate that television broadcasts from nearby Hungary could 
be received in his region and that other means of access to the outside world 
were available, including foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
A key moment was the broadcast of an interview he had given to Canadian 
journalists on the Hungarian television program Panorama. Tokes credits the 
program with a "role in all the revolutionary movements around Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
As it did with other dissidents in other countries, the program magnified his 
appeal, giving the population a rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that occurred throughout Eastern Europe among the different 
countries where there were lone human rights advocates," he says. "I think it 
can be generalized. For example, I think Vaclav Havel (now leader of 
Czechoslovakia) did not engineer an overthrow but through his public role 
succeeded in influencing the situation and anyone who was forward-looking in 
Czechoslovakia could group around him and gain concrete form." 
</P>
<P>
Yet in speaking of his moment of triumph last December, Tokes also recalls the 
cost of success. 
</P>
<P>
"The victory of Timisoara, if you can call it that, was the victory of 
publicity on one hand and unity (against Ceausescu)," he says. 
</P>
<P>
His comment about the price of revolution prompts a final question: What is his 
impression of America? 
</P>
<P>
Without hesitation he replies, "You haven't suffered ever as the people of 
Eastern and Central Europe have suffered. You have to import the suffering."

"I'm a little short for that," said Hill, who is generously listed at 5-foot-11 
on the Angels' roster. "Maybe when I grow up." 
</P>
<P>
The other thing he isn't likely to do is discuss the eye ailment that 
threatened his career. An infection that he developed in 1987, apparently 
caused by his contact lenses, didn't disappear until Hill was fitted with 
disposable lenses, which are discarded before bacteria can build on them. 
</P>
<P>
Free of discomfort and distorted vision, Hill has shown enough eagerness and 
versatility in spring training to virtually assure himself of a spot on the 
Angels' roster. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid can play three infield positions and switch-hit; there's not too many 
of those around," Angel Manager Doug Rader said of Hill, who was signed as a 
free agent in January and came to camp as a non-roster player. "If he remains 
healthy, he remains in our plans. The only thing that could get in the way is 
his eye problem." 
</P>
<P>
Eye problem? What eye problem? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no eye problem," said Hill, who was born in Pomona, graduated from 
Edison High School in Huntington Beach and later played at Orange Coast 
College. "It's completely gone now. It affected my vision, but it's cleared up 
and my eyes are fine." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 29, signed with the Oakland Athletics in 1981 and worked through their 
farm system as a shortstop. He was supposed to start the 1985 season in double 
A, but he was moved to second when Tony Phillips was injured during spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Hill batted .285 that season, with three home runs and 48 runs batted in, and 
hit .283 the following season as the regular second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Hill was traded to the Chicago White Sox in December, 1986 and opened the 1987 
season at second base, but his eye ailment put him on the disabled list early 
in the season and a hamstring injury put him back on the disabled list in July 
and August. He platooned at second for most of 1988, when his average fell to a 
career-low .217. 
</P>
<P>
He was released by the White Sox last March, but the A's signed him to a 
triple-A contract with their Tacoma affiliate. He batted .261 in 58 games, but 
was released by Oakland in August. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, familiar to Rader from Rader's stint as a coach and interim manager in 
Chicago, is determined not to waste this unexpected chance with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to camp ready to do everything I could to make the club," said Hill, 
who played second, short and third in Sunday's intrasquad game. "I was kind of 
worried during the lockout, but things have worked out OK so far. I look at 
this as getting another chance to prove I can play." 
</P>
<P>
Hill would fit into Rader's ideal of stockpiling versatile players if he can 
give second baseman Johnny Ray, shortstop Dick Schofield or third baseman Jack 
Howell an occasional rest without the Angels losing anything in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Rader has said that he will try second baseman Mark McLemore at third and 
short. Kent Anderson played at second and third last season, in addition to the 
65 games that he started at short. Bobby Rose can also play second or third. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming so versatile wasn't Hill's original plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland moved me to second in '85, but I really didn't think much about 
playing other positions until then," he said. "As time has gone on, especially 
if you're not starting, it helps to be able to play other positions. 
</P>
<P>
"I started at third in Chicago a little bit, so basically, I have quite a bit 
of time in at all three. Normally, I'd say I prefer second base, but I'm 
comfortable at all the rest. Wherever he (Rader) sticks me, I'll just try to do 
the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Hill was uncomfortable moving around the infield because "I didn't 
know how the ball comes to you off certain hitters." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm beyond that," he said. "It was an adjustment going from being a 
starter to being a utility player, too, but when Tony La Russa came over to 
(manage) Oakland, he went big with the 'Everybody plays' type of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had days off and we had a lot of guys coming in and out, especially 
as the game kprogressed. It wasn't hard for me. It's worked for the A's, 
especially the last couple years. It makes it easier on everybody when you have 
guys who can play different positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Tony Phillips. You could stick him anywhere, well, maybe anywhere but 
catcher." 
</P>
<P>
Hill says he might even try to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I've got to talk to Doug about that left-handed changeup I've been 
working on," joked Hill, who throws right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
The position he most wants, though, is a spot on the 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere they want to put me, I'll play my hardest," Hill said. "I know it's 
not over yet and I just have to keep doing whatever I can."
