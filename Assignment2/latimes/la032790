ARMY DESERTERS FIND REFUGE AT HOSPITAL WARD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a corner ward of a psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Vilnius, 26 
deserters from the Soviet army waited nervously Monday, protected from the 
military arrest they fear only by three nurses, a Red Cross flag and a locked 
door. 
</P>
<P>
The young men in the hospital ward are perfectly sane, but they have been 
inside the hospital for a week. They sought shelter there when the 
non-Communist government of Lithuania first offered them the feeble protection 
of the Red Cross and sanctuary in the hospital, where the army might hesitate 
to take them away. 
</P>
<P>
These deserters and 840 other Lithuanians, officials here say, have left their 
Soviet army units to return home in the last two weeks, since Lithuania 
declared its independence March 11. They are at the center of a tense showdown 
between authorities in Moscow and government leaders here. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have demanded that the young men, among an estimated 30,000 
Lithuanians serving in the Red Army, return to their units and have threatened 
to use force if they do not voluntarily comply. 
</P>
<P>
But Lithuanian leaders say any widespread attempt by military authorities to 
drag unwilling deserters back to their units could be a flash point for 
demonstrations on a scale not yet seen here. 
</P>
<P>
The republic's leaders say the deserters have no obligation to serve in an army 
of what they view as a foreign country. They have offered their full support to 
the deserters and whatever protection the tiny state can muster. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, three Soviet officers arrested one young deserter after 
nightfall on a central Vilnius street. But it was the only such confirmed 
detention, and so far Soviet army officials have not made good on their threat 
to collect the deserters on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, parents of deserters report late-night visits to their homes by 
military officials and surveillance outside by officers looking for the men who 
have left their units. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the deserters wait. The 26 who have taken refuge in the 
psychiatric hospital have become something of a cause celebre here -- their 
whereabouts an open secret among nearly everyone in town, including dozens of 
visiting foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
That publicity may be the only protection they have. While Lithuania's new 
leaders made ringing speeches in the first days of their tenure about 
"defending our boys," last weekend, the republic's president, Vytautas 
Landsbergis, acknowledged that there is little his government can do to prevent 
the young men from being taken back to their units by force. 
</P>
<P>
He advised army deserters not to stay at home or with relatives, to take refuge 
in churches or to vanish into hiding places of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Most seemed to have simply disappeared. Anyone asking here about the 
whereabouts of young men who have left the army gets a curt shrug from their 
family and friends. Go to the churches, and priests will say they have not seen 
them. Go to the office in the Supreme Council building here where the 
Lithuanian government is registering deserters, and the staff will say there is 
none to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"The deserters? You won't find them today," said Egle Taurinskaite, 25. "I 
think that every parent has hidden their child, that's what I think." 
</P>
<P>
The deserters sheltering in the Vilnius Hospital for the Mentally Disabled are 
between the ages of 18 and 21, and with the trust of youth, they believe firmly 
in the leaders of their home republic, the first freely elected government they 
have ever known. 
</P>
<P>
They say they are sure their hiding place is only a temporary stop, a prelude 
to negotiations that eventually will set them free of their military service. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not afraid," said Darius Baceulis, 20. "I expect the Lithuanian 
government will do something about this. And nobody would dare to attack the 
Red Cross." 
</P>
<P>
In the hospital ward, the smell of cabbage soup is stifling and the young men 
pace the dreary halls or read comic books and magazines or look at rock music 
videos on television. 
</P>
<P>
They came to the hospital after Lithuanian Red Cross officials told the 
republic's leaders that they would offer deserters food and shelter for as long 
as both are needed. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses say they pity the deserters, but the young men say they would rather 
be together than alone -- and rather locked up in a gloomy hospital ward than 
at their army bases. 
</P>
<P>
They complain of fierce hazing in the army and abuse from Russian officers, 
which they say is because they are from the Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sick and tired of serving in the Soviet army, and independence was a 
signal for us to leave," said Dacis Vycockis, 20. "We know the Soviet laws 
pretty well, and we knew what they would do if we left, but nevertheless this 
is what we chose. It's like rebelling against the Roman Empire. It is a 
rebellion of slaves." 
</P>
<P>
Gudanec Zhilvinas, 19, was serving in an army construction brigade in a small 
Latvian town when he heard that independence had been declared in Lithuania. He 
and his friends discussed what to do in the barracks late that night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, 13 of them, all Lithuanians, walked off the base and into the 
woods. They walked 25 miles, circling through the woods most of the day. Then 
they boarded a bus and came home. 
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid to stay with my family because the soldiers might kidnap me, so I 
am here," Zhilvinas said. "What else am I to do?"

LITHUANIA CRISIS EASED BY SOVIETS; 
</P>
<P>
SECESSION: GORBACHEV INSISTS HE WON'T USE 'COLD WAR METHODS' TO CONTROL THE 
REPUBLIC. HE ADDS THAT THE WEST HAS A DOUBLE STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN 
INTERVENTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's repeated assurance that the Kremlin 
will not seek to subjugate Lithuania by force and a key agreement between 
politicians and Soviet generals in Lithuania marked an easing of tensions 
Monday over the breakaway Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Gorbachev moved to cool the Lithuania 
crisis, saying that the Kremlin has shunned "Cold War methods" for good. 
</P>
<P>
But he also betrayed some vexation with the West's worries about the situation, 
telling his visitor that the West is trying to milk Lithuania's secession for 
political gain and taking a swipe at the United States for finding logic to 
justify its interventions in Panama and other foreign lands while rejecting 
steps taken by the Kremlin to keep order at home. 
</P>
<P>
"One's own actions, even in other countries, are measured by one standard, but 
the actions of others in their own country are (measured) by other standards 
and arouse 'concern,' " Gorbachev told the Massachusetts Democrat, according to 
the official news agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Bush Administration continued its rhetorical tightrope walk, 
trying to sound supportive to the Lithuanians without sounding provocative to 
the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"It is incumbent that both sides maintain open communications," White House 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement. "Neither side should 
undertake any actions which could preclude negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Referring specifically to Lithuania, Gorbachev said the Soviets have given 
"convincing proofs of our devotion to the new thinking, the policy of 
renouncing 'Cold War methods' and a reliance on force, respect for the right of 
the peoples to choose and to equal security." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's conciliatory remarks were published hours after Lithuanian leaders 
reached a key agreement with Soviet officers to create a committee to discuss 
how to prevent conflicts between the estimated 30,000 soldiers garrisoned in 
the republic and its 3.7 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
Both that accord reached in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, and the switch in 
Gorbachev's tone heralded the first easing in the war of nerves waged by the 
Kremlin since the republic's March 11 declaration of independence. And 
Lithuania's leader at the Vilnius talks saw a break in the political storm 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"After coming out of the meeting today, I can see that the mood has changed," 
Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas told a news conference. "It is evident 
the conflict will not be escalated." 
</P>
<P>
Those were welcome words in the Baltic land, which spent a nerve-racking 48 
hours over the weekend as more than 100 Soviet military vehicles rumbled 
through the heart of Vilnius, helicopters swirled overhead and paratroopers 
occupied four Communist Party buildings on orders, they said, "to protect 
them." 
</P>
<P>
State-run television also did its part Monday night to soothe tensions, 
reporting that war games planned long ago were the reason the Soviet army 
suddenly assumed a high profile in Lithuania. And it assured gun owners that 
their firearms would only be impounded temporarily under last Wednesday's order 
from Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Though upbeat, Ozolas said his talks had not yielded what the Lithuanians have 
been persistently seeking: a clear commitment from the Soviets to negotiate the 
terms of independence, including who gets the $83 billion in investments that 
one Moscow newspaper said were made in a half-century of Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the beginning of negotiations," Ozolas said. "These are small steps 
toward negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Lithuanians still need to be vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is safe to say that we have passed the most dangerous period, but 
the army and the CPSU (Soviet Communist Party) are working together, and there 
is no reason for us to let down our guard," the deputy prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove Ozolas right, helicopters continued to whir through the skies of 
Vilnius, dumping loads of Russian-language leaflets that accused the republic's 
leadership of "pushing the Lithuanian nation into an abyss of uncertainty." 
They called on Lithuanians to demonstrate against the independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who has opposed Lithuanian secession as illegal, showed no changes 
in that stance in his remarks to Kennedy. He said he would wield power as 
Soviet president "to defend democracy and glasnost (openness), to ensure the 
rule of law and constitutional order, to prevent the weakening of the state and 
stop militant actions that can provoke much trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But overall, the Soviet leader's comments were not as brusque as the directives 
he issued last week demanding that Lithuanians hand over all firearms, stop 
signing up for a voluntary police auxiliary and abandon an unlawful drive for 
secession. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev on Monday also held out the promise of a "just solution" once a law 
can be passed codifying procedures for secession by any of the 15 Soviet 
republics. The Lithuanians, whose homeland was independent from 1918 until the 
Kremlin absorbed it by force in 1940, say that the Soviets have no legal claims 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
Ozolas and Lithuanian Interior Minister Marijonas Misiukonis met with Col. 
Viktor Smokarev, deputy chief of the Vilnius military garrison, and Col. 
Vladimir Trikov of the Soviet Interior Ministry, which handles law enforcement 
affairs and has its own troops. 
</P>
<P>
Ozolas said that both groups pledged not to take action affecting security 
without informing the other and agreed to the formation of the coordinating 
group to exchange information. 
</P>
<P>
The military, he said, complained of the alleged beating of a soldier and of 
shots being fired from a moving car that missed other military personnel. He 
said those incidents are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians, for their part, want to know why military aircraft keep 
buzzing their cities, why armored columns have moved through the streets and 
who ordered the takeover of the party buildings. 
</P>
<P>
No answers were immediately forthcoming, and Lithuania's president, Vytautas 
Landsbergis, even questioned Monday night how scrupulously the Soviet army 
would observe the accord. 
</P>
<P>
He told a Vilnius news conference that in Kaunas, about 60 miles to the 
northwest, gun-toting soldiers entered a former political education institute 
without warning despite the military's earlier promise to give advance notice 
of movements. 
</P>
<P>
There were also reports in Vilnius, according to the Associated Press, that 
paratroopers had occupied another building, the Communist Party committee's 
headquarters in the port of Klaipeda, 200 miles northwest of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
Asked specifically if the Soviet army's takeover of buildings in Vilnius 
constituted a "use of force," Fitzwater said in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a use of a kind of military force that threatens lives. It is 
certainly a kind of force, and we would be opposed to any kind of use of force, 
without trying to pass judgment on any specific action." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis, a bespectacled professor of music history who led a successful 
two-year campaign for the independence proclamation, struck a more pessimistic 
note than Ozolas about Moscow's apparent willingness now to deal. "I can't be 
so optimistic regarding cooperation in this field," Landsbergis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian deputy prime minister said earlier that "there are very clear 
offers to finally have contact." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said after his talks with Gorbachev that the Kremlin leader reiterated 
that he has no intention of using force to compel Lithuania to return to the 
Soviet fold. 
</P>
<P>
"President Gorbachev indicated to me that the position of the Soviet Union was 
that there would be no use of force unless the lives of others were threatened 
and that he was committed to a peaceful resolution," Kennedy told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said that Gorbachev did not specify whose lives might be at risk in 
Lithuania, or whether he thought such threats were likely. 
</P>
<P>
Official Soviet media have repeatedly expressed concern for the fate of the 20% 
of Lithuania's population that is non-Lithuanian, including its 9% ethnic 
Russian minority. 
</P>
<P>
"In principle, we would welcome anything that lowers the tension here," said 
Anatoly Kalankarov, a Russian who works as a Communist Party functionary in a 
Vilnius factory. "But we regard the military as a sort of guarantee that our 
rights will not be disregarded completely." 
</P>
<P>
A rump party faction also pledges continuing loyalty to Moscow, and about 200 
of its members rallied outside Communist Party headquarters in Vilnius on 
Monday afternoon. One demonstrator toted a hand-lettered sign that read: 
"Lithuania without the U.S.S.R. is Lithuania without a future." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, leaders of Lithuania's mainstream Communist faction were meeting to 
discuss lessons to be drawn from their trouncing at the polls a month earlier. 
The elections brought the grass-roots nationalist group Sajudis into power, 
forced the ouster of Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas by Landsbergis 
as Lithuania's leader and hastened the independence declaration and Lithuania's 
collision with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Dahlburg reported from Moscow, and Schrader, a free-lance 
journalist, reported from Vilnius. Times staff writer David Lauter, in 
Washington, also contributed to this report.

AMBROSE ZARO; ENTHUSIAST FOR MT. WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ambrose Zaro, the one-time boxer and security guard who spent nearly his entire 
90 years keeping a seven-mile trail on Mt. Wilson navigable for hikers, joggers 
and bicyclists, has died at his home in Maywood. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Madre News reported last week that Zaro, who continued to dig rain 
troughs and move boulders on the scenic trail despite a heart attack in 1987, 
had died March 16. 
</P>
<P>
Zaro had first climbed Mt. Wilson as a boy of 14 after he caught a glimpse of 
the San Gabriels through his binoculars while attending school in downtown Los 
Angeles. He cut the remainder of his classes that day and hopped a Pacific 
Electric Car for Sierra Madre, where the mountain trail begins. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, hiking was a popular pastime. In 1911, an estimated 40,000 people 
had walked the trail to the top of the 5,710-foot mountain on a path first 
cleared by Benjamin Wilson, the grandfather of Gen. George S. Patton. Wilson 
had envisioned a logging venture but it proved a failure. 
</P>
<P>
As the trail fell into gradual disrepair, Zaro took it upon himself to become 
its custodian. Originally, he went four times a week, carrying 30 pounds of 
tools in a knapsack (plus his lunch, which normally consisted of a banana and 
some wine). There he would replace markers or repair the damage that rain, 
landslides, an occasional fire and the flood of tourists had caused. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 interview with The Times, Zaro said the work never bothered him -- 
even after he was past 80 and had to cut his visits to twice a week and lighten 
his load -- but the 42-mile round-trip from his home was frightening. 
</P>
<P>
"All that traffic," he said. "Usually I need a couple of beers afterward to 
relax my nerves." 
</P>
<P>
Zaro had dropped out of school at age 16, and to support himself (and later his 
wife, who died in 1985) he delivered telegrams, trained to be a prizefighter -- 
which proved of limited success -- and worked as a security guard and shipyard 
welder. 
</P>
<P>
As word of his efforts spread, Boy Scout troops and other hikers would help 
him. 
</P>
<P>
As the hiking fad faded over the years, he found himself more alone on the 
trail, and needed to focus his maintenance efforts only on the beginning two 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
The appreciative townsfolk of Sierra Madre would have him in to breakfast, 
provide him with hot showers and dry clothes and hold testimonials in his 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
He was grand marshal of one Fourth of July parade and received new boots from 
the grateful community. 
</P>
<P>
Zaro, despite the scars of poison oak and various accidents on the mountain, 
considered himself a fortunate man. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel good to see mothers and children walking the trail," he said 
during the 1987 interview, conducted on the trail. "And look how beautiful this 
(mountain) is. I've had a wonderful life." 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Madre is accepting donations in his name to the city's Mt. Wilson trail 
maintenance fund.

HARRIS TURNS TO U.S. COURTS IN LAST HOPE TO AVOID EXECUTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for condemned killer Robert Alton Harris filed a last-ditch appeal 
Monday with the federal court in San Diego, the first step in the last legal 
procedure Harris has left to avoid being executed next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, convicted of the 1978 murders of two San Diego teen-agers, contended in 
his legal papers that new psychiatric evidence shows he had suffered from brain 
damage that could have led to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William B. Enright in San Diego, who initially handled -- 
and rejected -- Harris' previous appeals in federal court, was expected to 
begin reviewing the case Monday night. The new appeal essentially set forth the 
same arguments that failed to persuade the California Supreme Court earlier 
this month to spare Harris. 
</P>
<P>
In denying Harris' first federal appeal in 1982, Enright called Harris' death 
sentence "an appropriate and deserved penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, is in line to become the first person executed in California in 23 
years. 
</P>
<P>
His case has progressed further through the court system than any of the other 
more than 270 prisoners on Death Row in California. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected appeals of Harris conviction and sentencing 
four times, most recently on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court upheld Harris' death sentence in 1981. On March 
16, 1990, the state Supreme Court turned down an appeal Harris' San Diego 
attorneys, Charles M. Sevilla and Michael McCabe, had filed on Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
That rejection meant that, under the complicated court procedures for death 
penalty appeals, Harris' last hope was to turn to the federal courts.

CUDAHY SCHOOL WITH OOZE IN PLAYGROUND TO REOPEN IN FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Cudahy elementary school that has been shut down for more than eight months 
because its playground is contaminated with petroleum waste is scheduled to 
reopen in the fall, Los Angeles school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles school board has approved plans to cover the playground at Park 
Avenue Elementary School with a layer of asphalt to prevent the sludge of 
petroleum chemical compounds from rising to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
School officials hope to have the school reopened at the beginning of the 
school year in September, school board member Leticia Quezada said last week at 
a meeting of parents, teachers, residents and state and school officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although the petroleum-contaminated soil and sludge will not be removed, 
parents, teachers and administrators said they are satisfied that the covering 
will protect the students. They said they are tired of waiting and want to get 
back to their own school. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school, at 8020 Park Ave., was closed last summer after parents 
and teachers raised concerns about health hazards associated with the tar-like 
petroleum sludge that appeared in tiny puddles on the surface of the asphalt 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Park Avenue students have been sent to either Teresa Hughes 
Elementary School or Clara Street Primary Center, which operate year-round. 
Administrators and parents said Park Avenue students who have been attending 
these schools, which were already overcrowded, have become like guests who have 
overstayed their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to go back to our own school," said parent Maria Castillo, who has 
three children diverted from Park Avenue. "We're not wanted (at the other 
schools) and we don't want to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Jose Velasquez, who has been trying to keep track of his Park Avenue 
students, said the whole experience has been an administrative nightmare. 
"What's important now is that we get back to our school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to an environmental report released in January, Park Avenue school 
was built on an old city dump that contained petroleum-contaminated soil and 
several pockets of tar-like petroleum sludge. 
</P>
<P>
But the report by Angelo Bellomo, director of an environmental engineering firm 
that conducted a series of tests last November and December, concluded that 
students would not face any health hazards as long as they did not have 
prolonged contact with the sludge.

BOB HOPE'S MOUNTAIN LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is interesting to note that Times writer Alan Citron is exercising "freedom 
of the press," Margot Feuer (member of Save the Mountain Park Coalition) and 
Mary Wiesbrock (environmental activist) "freedom of speech," (Part A, March 7) 
and cartoonist Conrad "freedom of artistic venom" ("Faith, hope and damn little 
charity," March 16). However, it appears they would have us believe that "free 
enterprise" is a dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
Free enterprise is an important element in our democratic form of government; 
an element being embraced throughout the world now more than any time in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hope is an extremely charitable man. Few have given so much to so many so 
often. Hope's concern for his fellow man is near legend. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to calculate how many millions he has raised for charitable 
causes by performance, presence, name and direct donation. 
</P>
<P>
And, unless something has happened overnight that I'm unaware of, I believe it 
is the "right" of the donor to indicate the recipient of the gift. 
</P>
<P>
If Citron had investigated a little further he would have found out about the 
provision in the sale of Hope's property (7,400 acres in the Santa Monica 
Mountains) which calls for a donation of 1,000 acres of prime land to the 
National Park Service.

SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every day we are bombarded by the media with more and more news of events 
occurring in the Soviet Union and are told how quickly the Soviets are 
"democratizing." 
</P>
<P>
I hope that as democracy is phased in, the structure of the Soviet Union is 
phased out because the two cannot exist together. If you have democracy, you 
cannot have a Soviet empire because the two are a contradiction in terms and 
meaning. This is especially important in view of how many people were destroyed 
during and after the formation of the Soviet Union. Let us not forget those who 
were so wantonly annihilated in body and spirit.

CABLE CON IN SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cable television situation in South-Central Los Angeles is obviously a 
fiasco: In the early 1980s, when Los Angeles was in the process of awarding 
cable franchises, the right to serve the predominantly black area was awarded 
to Mayor Tom Bradley's long-time supporter Eli Broad, who is white, on the 
condition that he offer a 20% interest in the venture to black community 
leaders and groups, all of whom had close ties to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop H.H. Brookins was one of the beneficiaries of the process, as were other 
politically influential clergymen, and developer Danny Bakewell. 
</P>
<P>
They were among the minority partners who were not required to invest any of 
their own money. None have participated in the operation of the franchise. 
Their only activity has been to collect profits. It shows: Today, seven years 
after the franchise was awarded, 52,000 homes in South-Central Los Angeles are 
still without any access to cable television. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation in The Times Sunday that Brookins and others in the mayor's 
circle of enterprising friends were handed shares in the lucrative franchise as 
virtual gifts is more than just another example of how badly the Bradley 
Administration's chronic cronyism has abused and affronted the public interest. 
For the most distressing aspect of the ongoing City Hall tale is that so much 
of the self-enrichment accomplished by the mayor's friends was achieved through 
manipulation of city programs intended to expand economic opportunities for 
women and ethnic minorities. Canny insiders like Brookins apparently took them 
as just another chance to do well for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the real victims of the avarice evident in this and other such 
affairs that recently have come to light are the struggling minority 
communities whose interests the mayor's cronies claim to exemplify.

KRAUTHAMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to respond to Charles Krauthammer's column (Op-Ed Page, March 11): 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Krauthammer, what kind of dream world are you living in? Your figures, I 
presume, are supposed to make us "feel good," but they are framed only by 
percentages of success revealed by the GNP and the metamorphosis of communism 
to the so-called democratic electoral process which is bogged down in 
tremendous complexity before international benefits can result. Meanwhile, our 
deficit-laden economy sits heavily on the backs of the people of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Our health has declined as has our educational system. Union busting by the 
previous Administration and deregulation in every phase of business accompanied 
by the lack of medical insurance, the stress and strain of husband and wife 
employment necessitated by rising inflation, our roads and transportation 
deteriorated, violence caused by economic and housing failures, military 
wastefulness, questionable incursions into other countries, all place the 
United States and the world in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Krauthammer, your peripheral thinking reminds me of the saying that "liars 
figure but figures don't lie." It takes courage to see things as they really 
are instead of twisting figures to make us "feel good." You do not recognize 
the need to change our priorities so that you can get clear on the difference 
between honest figures and what is hogwash! 
</P>

FLEISCHMAN ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fleischman cites test-tube babies as irrefutable proof that "life" begins the 
moment an egg is fertilized, and that destroying a fertilized egg amounts to 
killing a person. This, of course, is tantamount to calling every doctor a 
killer when he discards those eggs fertilized in-vitro that are surplus and 
therefore not used for implant. 
</P>
<P>
The same shoddy logic -- cleverly disguised as a nonpartisan dissertation -- 
goes into the "circular reasoning" of using the conclusion of the argument as 
its premise. 
</P>
<P>
To top it all off, the author is identified not as the pro-life activist she 
is, but as "an attorney with a special interest in reproduction issues as a 
function of civil liberties and human rights." 
</P>
<P>
Giving such prominent exposure -- even in the Opinion Section -- to this kind 
of sophistry and implying that the author is a civil libertarian -- a term 
associated with the pro-choice movement -- comes awfully close to willful 
deception.

COOLING THE MEDICAL-COST EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A program to develop national standards for a variety of medical procedures 
could lead to a major breakthrough in the effort to improve health care in the 
United States while containing its cost. 
</P>
<P>
The implications are profound. Agreement on standards would help eliminate 
unnecessary operations at a time when studies indicate that many interventions 
are inappropriate. Beyond that, however, the establishment of agreed parameters 
would influence medical education, strengthening the direction of instruction. 
It would also establish a better base on which charges of malpractice can be 
more rationally judged to eliminate the unnecessary tests and other procedures 
that doctors sometimes undertake simply to create a defense against potential 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement brings together the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, the American 
Medical Assn. and a newly established Academic Medical Center Consortium that 
includes UCLA. Called "The Clinical Appropriateness Initiative," the joint 
program will address immediately the increasingly costly and dangerous practice 
of unnecessary surgery. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, RAND and the academic centers will complete proposed 
appropriateness standards on four widely used procedures: cataract, aortic 
aneurysm, coronary artery bypass surgery and carotid endarterectomy. This will 
include precise indications of when intervention is or is not appropriate. This 
work will then be translated by the AMA -- working with the medical specialty 
societies -- into "user friendly" guidelines for practicing physicians and 
surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to the plan, the AMA has apparently made a significant shift of 
policy from what had appeared to be hostility to efforts to intrude on the 
individual doctor's authority for medical decisions. That is a welcome 
recognition by the AMA that existing practices produce a high ratio of 
unnecessary operations and costs that have spiraled out of control. It is a 
tribute to the work at RAND, under the direction of Dr. Robert H. Brook, in 
devising a way to interpret under what circumstances intervention is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the consortium will largely depend on decisions at the federal 
level. Generous contributions from the John A. Hartford Foundation and the 
Commonwealth Fund, and in- kind contributions from the AMA, RAND and the 
academic institutions, are funding its initial work. But federal support also 
will be required. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, establishment of the consortium coincides with the creation last 
December by Congress of the Agency for Health Care Research and Policy within 
the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency's mandate includes 
preparation of practice guidelines as part of a broader study of cost and 
quality elements of the health-care system. The agency will be spending more 
than $30 million this year alone to fund practice guideline research compared 
to the $1.5 million in foundation grants available to the consortium. A 
substantial part of the federal funds will be needed for the work of the 
consortium if duplication of research efforts is to be avoided and development 
of the guidelines accelerated.

FLEISCHMAN ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The logic of Fleischman's point of view is irrefutable. It is refreshing to 
read an analysis that removes the advocacy component of the abortion 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this perspective does not sway legislatures to pass 
anti-abortion laws, nor masses to march for choice. We are stuck with 
emotionalism, illogic, polarization and, I fear, no resolution or compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion has become the central, hysterical issue in many American communities. 
Rather, the debate should be conducted within the context of other tough 
choices of life and death with which society must deal.

SAVING SOCIETY IN 10 MINUTES A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the absences that stand out first in the Crenshaw Area Probation Office: 
no guards, no police, no quarrels or tantrums. Department stores feel tenser on 
a busy day. 
</P>
<P>
The waiting room is quiet but cozy, too. Families show up together. Small 
children are cuddled on laps. Old men shuffle in on canes. Young couples giggle 
privately in the back row. A tough guy with shades greets an old friend from 
Bible study classes. Men sleep in hand-me-downs; women rest swollen feet. 
</P>
<P>
"My clients -- have mercy on them!" says Chalmetta Johnson, deputy probation 
officer. "Most of them were just caught up in something they didn't know what 
to do with." 
</P>
<P>
What do we think a probation officer does? When the court hands out two years 
probation, sentence suspended, when it decrees no mixing with known narcotic 
users, criminals, guns, whatever -- whom do we imagine will be there to 
nurture, heal, watch over, to lead back to righteousness and Wheaties for 
breakfast? 
</P>
<P>
Chalmetta Johnson puts her bony elbows on the desk and stares at the young man 
fidgeting with excuses before her. Love, defiance and sorrow are in her eyes. 
"Now, you and I are not strangers. We've been looking at each other's faces for 
a while and I'm as serious as a heart attack. If you don't have a job, then how 
are you living? I can't hardly live -- and I'm working." 
</P>
<P>
She has had 30 years of this, holding faith that in 10 minutes or so once a 
month, she can actually make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
To the pimply 23-year-old with a wife and, now, a fourth child, she urges 
prophylactics. ("My clients understand 'rubbers' but 'prophylactics' exposes 
them to the beauty of the English language.") To the homeless boy with a 
racking cough: "Are you eating enough? Now, how are we going to get you juice, 
juice, juice?" The hungry, the poor, the huddled masses to which were promised 
something better: "I know this is wrong of me," she says, "but I can't see that 
it's all their fault." 
</P>
<P>
What jobs are there for a 37-year-old American who can neither read nor write, 
must support his mother and now has a conviction? How do you pay back society's 
restitution fund when your pockets are empty? 
</P>
<P>
Chalmetta Johnson was born in another time and place, in the South, a time of 
riding the back of the bus, of domestic service and hungry fear. She fought her 
way to college: "I knew I was going, I just didn't know how to get there." She 
dreamed of teaching school, and when she followed her husband to California in 
1958, she found she could not afford the extra courses for state qualification. 
"I found this job, and thank God I did because I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Is she tired? Of course she is tired: years of long days in an airless office, 
of giving her heart to hundreds at a time, of raising a daughter alone and 
sending her through college -- and still, somehow, she believes that lives can 
be made right. Something personal came between her and the Lord at some point; 
the faith that sustains her now is a rock-bottom, bared-to-the-bone love. $477 
a week take-home pay, nearly 250 cases to manage alone since Proposition 13 -- 
and still she goes back and forth on stiff and dragging legs, from waiting room 
to interview cubicle, gathering clients to save and render wholesome as if the 
world could care. "Honey," she says, "taxpayers do not consider it to the best 
advantage to take care of crooks, or pamper them, or whatever they think we do. 
If it doesn't fit, throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone works her way. The endless chits of paper, forms and folders, 
rotten backs and bad nerves, the rituals of order over chaos -- they are all 
there to hide behind. But for her brief minutes with them, Chalmetta Johnson 
reaches out to those before her: mother, nanny, seducer, teacher, voice of love 
and law. 
</P>
<P>
Does she not ever rail against a society that crushes men thus? "If there's 
some place better," she says with a wrenching smile, "I sure don't know about 
it."

PEOPLE: HARVARD DEAN TAKES STANFORD BUSINESS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Harvard University dean has been selected as dean of Stanford University's 
Graduate School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
A. Michael Spence, 46, dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, was 
picked to be the seventh dean of the prestigious graduate school, which ranked 
No. 1 in a recent published report. 
</P>
<P>
In his Harvard post, Spence, a former Rhodes Scholar, led 700 faculty members 
and 9,000 students enrolled in undergraduate programs, master's and doctoral 
programs for all departments, excluding the professional schools. Spence's 
Harvard post, comparable to the role of provost at other universities, is 
considered the second most powerful at the Ivy League institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Spence is an extremely able academic administrator," said Stanford 
Provost James N. Rosse. "The selection committee developed a clear idea of the 
kind of leadership it wanted. There is no doubt we found the person who could 
carry that role." 
</P>
<P>
Spence, an economist who held joint appointments in the economics department 
and at the Harvard Business School before becoming dean, replaces Robert K. 
Jaedicke, who's stepping down after six years to return to teaching and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Spence said the Stanford business school is "a wonderful school with 
outstanding faculty and terrific students. This is a major opportunity to be 
involved with people I respect and to do something important." 
</P>
<P>
Spence, who taught at Stanford from 1973 to 1975, takes over a Stanford 
business school comprised of 660 students in the two-year MBA program, 42 Sloan 
Fellows and 84 doctoral students. The faculty numbers 120.

The stock market closed with modest gains Monday, supported by a sharp rebound 
in the Tokyo stock market, but the market ended far from its peaks as a big 
fall in gold prices put pressure on stocks. The Dow Jones index of 30 
industrials, up about 20 points in the early going, settled for a 3.38-point 
gain to close at 2,707.66. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 826 up, 664 down and 491 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The recently battered Tokyo stock market began to rebound on Friday. It surged 
ahead nearly 5% Monday for its second-largest daily gain. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that prompted hopes that turmoil in the Japanese markets might 
subside without having caused many ripple effects in other financial centers 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the dollar continued its recent climb against the Japanese 
yen in foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bond market, which has benefited from the dollar's strength, extended 
its recent rally, pushing interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
But activity in U.S. stocks set a sluggish pace all day, and as the session 
progressed, prices failed to hold at their early peaks. Brokers cited worries 
about unpleasant surprises in forthcoming earnings reports for the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose 5/8 
to 41 3/4 as the company launched its venture into the credit card business; 
Procter &amp; Gamble gained 7/8 to 68 1/8; Coca-Cola was up 1/4 to 74 3/8, and 
General Motors added 1 1/8 to 47 1/2.

Tokos Medical of Santa Ana went public at $12 a share Monday and closed at 11 
3/4. The company, which provides home health services for detection and 
treatment of early labor in pregnancy, sold 2 million shares in the offering. 
Tokos Chief Executive Robert Byrnes said the stock was depressed Monday by 
additional stock sales by company founders, which he said had been expected.

Prices closed higher on London's Stock Exchange, boosted by increased 
institutional activity, program trading and a shortage of blue-chip stocks. 
Buying in the stock index futures market also helped propel the cash market

The U.S. Treasury's key 30-year bond was up 11/32 point, or $3.40 per $1,000 in 
face value, by midday EST. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction 
from price, slipped to 8.44% from 8.47% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said buying was sparked by the dollar's persistent upward climb 
against the yen despite efforts by the Bank of Japan to stem the gains. A 
stronger dollar increases the value of dollar-denominated assets, such as 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"Good dollar buying overseas pushed us up," said Mitchell Held, chief financial 
economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "Other than that, it's 
pretty quiet here." 
</P>
<P>
Credit market observers said the drop in precious metals prices also was 
helping bond prices. Investors in gold and other important metals generally 
sell when prices are declining and buy dollar-denominated securities. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were up between 1/16 point and 1/8 point at midday, intermediate maturities 
rose between 3/16 and 9/32 point and long-term issues advanced between 3/8 and 
13/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from late Friday.

Soviet Tensions Help Send Dollar Higher 
</P>
<P>
The dollar, boosted by political tension in the Soviet Union and expectations 
of continued weakness in the Japanese yen, finished higher against most major 
currencies in European trading Monday, then fell in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar has been bid up due to speculation that U.S. interest rates will 
remain at present levels or higher. There is a perception that the Federal 
Reserve Board won't nudge rates down because economic growth appears adequate 
while inflationary pressures persist. 
</P>
<P>
Tension in the Soviet Union over the Lithuanian independence movement and 
forecasts of further weakness in the Japanese yen also have driven up the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers also noted some disappointment that Japan Finance Minister Ryutaro 
Hashimoto was unable to secure any apparent monetary concessions from U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady during weekend meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to 156.70 yen in New York from 154.30 yen late Friday. In 
Tokyo, the dollar rose by 1.33 yen to 156.40 yen Monday, its highest close 
since Jan. 13, 1987. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 156.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound strengthened to $1.6185 in New York from $1.6010 on Friday. 
Sterling traded late in London at $1.6135, up from $1.6040 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Friday's quotes, 
included: 1.7075 West German marks.

Statutory Records: As Oscar ages, it becomes harder to set new records. 
</P>
<P>
William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is still the most Oscared film of all time with its 
11 awards out of 12 nominations. Katharine Hepburn remains the most Oscared of 
all performers with her four statuettes, and the late John Ford will still be 
the most Oscared director with his four awards. So far, Oscar Hammerstein holds 
the record for the only Oscar to win an Oscar. BETH KLEID

Prima Ballerina Honored in Berlin: American ballet star Eva Evdokimova was 
cheered by 3,000 fans in West Berlin Sunday following a major weekend gala 
honoring her 20-year association with the city's opera house ballet company. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers were thrown on stage at the end of the gala, in which the prima 
ballerina danced several of the roles that brought her fame in the ballet 
world, including "La Sylphide" and the "Dying Swan." During a 30-minute 
standing ovation, the 41-year-old had to take more than 30 curtain calls. 
Evdokimova was the first Western artist to perform regularly as a guest star 
with the renowned Kirov Ballet in Leningrad. BETH KLEID

'Most Wanted' Scores Again: Indiana state police headed to Elko, Nev., on 
Monday to take into custody a murder suspect who was turned in by viewers of

Parker said several viewers of Sunday night's episode called in to the show to 
say that the suspect, Joey Higgins, was working at a tire store in Elko. 
Higgins was arrested by Elko police at his home without incident. Sunday 
night's profile of Higgins' crime was the third time the case had aired on the

NASA managers recommended that the space shuttle Discovery take off on schedule 
from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida April 12 to launch the Hubble Space 
Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians found that a nut on the landing gear of another shuttle had moved 
out of alignment. NASA spokesman Ed Campion said analysis indicated the 
misaligned nut, likely caused by impact upon landing, posed no danger. A final 
decision on the launch is expected this week.

Conrail agreed to pay $5.5 million in the last of about 370 court claims 
stemming from a fiery Amtrak-Conrail train wreck that killed 16 people near 
Baltimore in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Susan Schweitzer, 45, of New York, said the settlement came just 
before selection of a jury to hear the civil damage trial in Baltimore. The 
crash occurred Jan. 4, 1987, when three Conrail locomotives ran through a 
switch and into the path of an Amtrak train. Conrail engineer Ricky L. Gates 
later admitted that he and brakeman Edward Cromwell had smoked marijuana just 
before the crash.

AVIANCA PILOT CALLED 'INATTENTIVE' TO FUEL

<TEXT>
<P>
The pilot of Avianca Flight 52 was aware that he was low on fuel but appeared 
"inattentive" to the problem and seemed to take "little action" in 
communicating it to air controllers, a source told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The flight's co-pilot and flight engineer also took no bold steps to alert the 
captain or controllers to the fuel emergency, a source close to the 
investigation said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity. The findings were 
based on cockpit conversations recorded on the Colombian flight during the 30 
minutes before it crashed on Long Island, N.Y., Jan. 25, killing 73 people.

TEACHERS SUPPORT GAS TAX MEASURE

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Teachers Assn. has agreed to actively support Proposition 111, a 
June 5 ballot measure that would modify the state's spending limit and increase 
the gas tax. The decision by the 230,000-member organization is a boost for the 
campaign to win voter approval of the tax increase, which would add 9 cents a 
gallon over four years. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers group had threatened last December to finance a campaign against 
the measure. CTA President Ed Foglia said teachers were concerned that the 
proposed modifications in the spending limit would erase many of the gains 
education won in 1988 with Proposition 98, the school finance initiative. But 
over the weekend Foglia told the group's policy-making body that legislative 
leaders have now agreed to support a bill that would guarantee that "education 
still gets its fair share of the state budget."

U.S. OFFICIALS RELEASE FUNDS FOR 2ND LEG OF METRO RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction on the second leg of the Metro Rail project, to run from MacArthur 
Park to Hollywood, could begin by the end of the year now that federal transit 
officials have agreed to release $667 million in funds Congress authorized two 
years ago, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Release of the monies by the federal Urban Mass Transit Administration ends 
years of sometimes bitter conflict over costs, routes and control of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, said the announcement represents "a consensus at the local and 
federal levels on where the Metro Rail line is going next, how it's being 
funded and by whom." 
</P>
<P>
The 6.8-mile leg, costing $1.4 billion, will run from Wilshire Boulevard and 
Alvarado Street to Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, and is scheduled to 
open in 1998, Peterson said. It will extend the 4.4-mile Metro Red Line which 
is under construction downtown and is scheduled to open in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
An additional Congressional appropriation will be needed for the subway's third 
segment, which would go to Universal City and North Hollywood, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the money for the project's second leg "has taken a heck of a long 
time," Peterson said, adding that Monday's announcement means that "there is no 
antagonism between the Administration, Congress and ourselves on whether this 
is a wise expenditure of scarce funds." 
</P>
<P>
The funds also mean "that an estimated 260,000 people will be riding the Metro 
Red Line daily in eight years, alleviating transportation-related smog and 
easing the stress on our streets and highways," Mayor Tom Bradley said in a 
statement issued through the Transportation Commission. "The Metro Red Line is 
the single largest rail transit project in the country that the federal 
government is involved in." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) announced release of the funds Monday. The 
money was authorized in the 1987 highway bill when Congress overrode President 
Ronald Reagan's veto. Since half of Metro Rail's funds come from local sources, 
Wilson said, the funding agreement "demonstrates the federal government's 
recognition of Los Angeles' contribution and its commitment to sharing in Metro 
Rail's completion." 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the Transportation Commission, called 
the funding agreement "a major step in bringing rail transit back to Los 
Angeles County. It also brings us another step closer to serving the San 
Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said UMTA chief Bryan Clymner and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. 
Skinner will formally sign the funding agreement in Los Angeles on April 10.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER DEFENDANT WINS LIBEL SUIT AGAINST 
WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A journalist was ordered Monday to pay a murder defendant $6,500 for an article 
that concluded the man arranged his wife's slaying in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The order came despite the fact that the libel case victor is currently on 
trial for allegedly trying to arrange the murder, and is serving a prison term 
for plotting an earlier unsuccessful attempt to kill his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Kazuyoshi Miura, the plaintiff in the libel suit, is on trial along with a 
friend in connection with the shooting death of his wife in Los Angeles in 
November, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Miura, 42, filed suit against magazine writer Joji Abe in October, one year 
after the article appeared in the Weekly Asahi. A Tokyo court found that Abe's 
conclusion that Miura ordered his wife, Kazumi, slain was not based on 
sufficient evidence.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAS COMPANY BEGINS ITS OWN RECYCLING 
PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Gas Co. on Monday announced that its previously wasted 
heaps of white paper scrap -- memos, letters, and assorted bureaucratic 
leftovers -- will be separated and recycled in a model program that officials 
hope other businesses will imitate. 
</P>
<P>
But in fact, such recycling programs are now "very common throughout Los 
Angeles," said Joan Edwards, director of the city's integrated solid waste 
management office. 
</P>
<P>
"Many paper dealers offer this service. It's their bread and butter." 
</P>
<P>
A news conference in Chatsworth featured Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy 
Picus helping to dump sheets of used white paper into a large bin for 
collection by a private recycling contractor. Under the plan, used white paper 
from the gas company office will be sold to the recycler, with a portion of the 
money going to a volunteer service organization in Van Nuys.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEXICAN FRUIT FLY FIND SPURS ROUND OF 
TRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State agriculture officials announced Monday the discovery of a single Mexican 
fruit fly in East Los Angeles, triggering a round of intensive trapping in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The fly, which was found Friday in an orange tree, threatens many of the same 
fruits as the Mediterranean fruit fly. Officials said there are no plans now to 
conduct aerial malathion sprayings because only a single fly was found. The 
Medfly infestation in Los Angeles and Orange counties now covers about 500 
square miles and is the largest in Southern California's history.

TOP AIR POLLUTION PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has responsibility to control 
air pollution in the area. It has the power to seek court-imposed fines against 
polluters of from $25 to $25,000 a day based on such factors as the extent that 
emissions exceed legal limits, the potential danger to the public, whether the 
violation was intentional, accidental or due to negligence and the company's 
history of violations. These are the 10 highest penalties paid in February:

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE BANS OBSTRUCTION OF GREYHOUND 
OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Monday forbade striking Greyhound workers 
to interfere with the bus line's operations or vandalize its property. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary order, agreed on by lawyers for Greyhound and the Amalgamated 
Transit Union AFL-CIO, Local 1222, affects strikers from Bakersfield to the 
Mexican border and the Pacific Ocean to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
It comes almost a month after Greyhound employees across the country mounted a 
work stoppage March 2. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Greyhound said the order was needed because Greyhound workers 
began trying to obstruct bus operations within days of the strike by deflating 
tires, pounding on buses, pelting buses with tomatoes and committing other acts 
of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the labor unions could not be reached for comment Monday.

BOARD MOVES TO INCREASE SCHOOLS' AUTONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL and SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education on Monday took the next big step in its 
promise to reorganize schools in ways that give principals, teachers and 
parents more authority. 
</P>
<P>
Despite complaints by some parents that they are overlooked, the board voted 
unanimously to adopt guidelines for schools that want to increase their 
autonomy. The guidelines will be explained in a 1:30 p.m. "teleconference" 
Thursday broadcast over Channel 58 and to all 837 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District adopted the school-based management 
concept as part of its settlement of a teachers' strike last June. The new 
contract called for each school to establish a decision-making council that 
allows teachers, parents and community leaders to share responsibility for 
making decisions that were once the purview of school principals and 
high-ranking district administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of school restructuring is to raise student achievement by 
giving individual schools greater flexibility to plan academic programs that 
address specific student needs. 
</P>
<P>
Since the elected school leadership councils began forming last summer, they 
have been limited to making decisions in five areas -- staff development, 
student discipline, event scheduling, use of school equipment and allotment of 
lottery money and other special school funds. 
</P>
<P>
The move to the second phase of the restructuring process will allow schools to 
broaden the areas in which they can make decisions. All those proposals must be 
approved by a central Decision-Making Council. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 70 school councils will be selected in the first year to implement this 
second step -- called School-Based Management -- and make fundamental changes 
in their schools' operation in areas such as curriculum and teacher hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those changes may run counter to district policy or even violate 
teachers' contracts, but waivers could be granted by the central council if the 
change will improve student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Several school districts around the nation, including Chicago, Dade County, 
Fla., and Rochester, N.Y., have restructured schools to place more authority 
and responsibility for improving education with administrators, teachers and 
parents at the local level.

REVENGE AGAINST BURGLARS LED TO SLAYINGS, COURT TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: AFTER LAUREL CANYON MURDERS, DEFENDANT EDDIE NASH LAMENTED THE 'BLOODY 
MESS,' LIBERACE'S FORMER LOVER TESTIFIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A former lover of the late pianist Liberace testified Monday that a defendant 
in the Laurel Canyon murder trial vowed to track down those who had burglarized 
his home and "teach them a lesson," but later lamented that "things (had) gone 
too far." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Thorson, 31, testified that during a 1981 visit to his cocaine supplier, 
Adel (Eddie Nash) Nasrallah, he overheard Nash tell his bodyguard and now 
co-defendant Gregory Diles and pornographic film star John Holmes to retrieve 
drugs, money and jewelry taken from his Studio City home. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd have 'em all on their knees, teach them a lesson, and that they'd 
never steal from him again," Thorson said under questioning by Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Dale Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
About a year after four people were bludgeoned to death in a Laurel Canyon 
home, Nash brought up the subject of the slayings several times while he and 
Thorson were free-basing cocaine, Thorson testified. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Nash said that things have gone too far, that it had turned into a bloody 
mess," Thorson testified, nervously chewing his lower lip. 
</P>
<P>
Thorson did not elaborate on what "things" were, but the prosecution contends 
that the murders were ordered by Nash and carried out by Diles and unnamed 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Nash also threatened Thorson, he testified. "He said that people have a habit 
of disappearing in the canyon. 'By the time they find you, Scott,' " Thorson 
recalled Nash saying, " 'I'll have had every tooth in your head pulled so they 
can't identify you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jeff Brodey, who represents Nash, suggested in his 
cross-examination that Thorson had fabricated his account, drawing details from 
newspaper clippings. 
</P>
<P>
"You've just made up this story," Brodey said, "and integrated it into this 
complete web of lies you've told about Mr. Nash over the past three days, 
haven't you?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I didn't," Thorson said. 
</P>
<P>
Four bodies were found bludgeoned to death nine years ago in a Laurel Canyon 
home that one of the victims had rented. 
</P>
<P>
The savage slayings were first blamed on Holmes, who was acquitted of murder 
charges in 1982. In September, 1988, six months after Holmes' death, 
authorities said they finally had enough evidence to charge Nash and Diles, who 
had long been suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
A substantial part of that new evidence was information provided by Thorson, 
who is now in the federal witness protection program.

VENTURA TO STUDY DIFFERENT WATER SOURCES; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: THE CITY HIRES AN ENGINEERING COMPANY TO EVALUATE 18 WAYS OF EASING 
THE WATER SHORTAGE. SOME OFFICIALS DOUBT THE PLANS WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura city officials have hired an engineering company to evaluate 18 
possible ways of easing the city's looming water crisis, but officials 
cautioned that even all the ideas together probably won't have much effect on 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Among the alternatives to be considered are purchasing water from small water 
companies that provide agricultural irrigation on the city's east side, 
bringing state water from Piru Creek down the Santa Paula River and injecting 
treated sewage water to recharge the city's ground-water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report by Boyle Engineering Corp. of Newport Beach outlining the 
options was formally presented to the Ventura City Council at Monday's meeting. 
The company will update the report for the city's ad-hoc water committee April 
17, said Councilwoman Cathy Bean, who is a member of the committee. A final 
report will go to the full council later. 
</P>
<P>
City officials familiar with the report said Monday that although the 18 
options -- which, according to the report, "could be on-line within 12 months" 
-- are worth investigating, they are unlikely to produce much, if any, water. 
The city faces possible shortages as a result of a drought that is entering its 
fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably three or four things in the whole list that even make 
sense," said Mayor Richard Francis. "We should pare down the list before we go 
forward with the in-depth studies, but this is no panacea. There is no end-all 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these alternatives are somewhere near science fiction," Bean said. 
"But when you are faced with an emergency, you have to explore." 
</P>
<P>
The first five options outlined in the report involve purchasing water from 
Alta Mutual Water Co., Montalvo Mutual Water Co., Farmer's Ditch Irrigation 
Co., Sherman Acres Mutual Water Co. and Limoneira Co. -- small water companies 
that have traditionally supplied farms on the east end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said that although these were viable water sources, at least two 
companies have bylaws limiting their customer base to agricultural users. 
Although these laws could be changed for the duration of the water crisis, he 
said, it remains to be seen how much water these providers have to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most provocative alternative in the report is the possibility of 
expanding use of reclaimed sewage water, which is now used to irrigate several 
parks and golf courses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility raised during last Tuesday's meeting between the consultants 
and the ad-hoc water committee involved using some of this water to recharge 
the city's ground-water supply. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Mayor Donald Villeneuve, who participated in that meeting, said the 
possibility has been all but discarded because of the high costs involved in 
purifying the water to meet state health standards for ground water. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it would entail the same process needed to desalinate sea water, so 
I don't think it is feasible," Villeneuve said. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said that if the city used all of its reclaimed water instead of 
discharging it into the Ventura and Santa Clara rivers, the diversion of water 
would destroy wildlife habitats and the rivers' ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
Another option would be to draw water from wells located on individual farms. 
"If anything, we're talking about very small amounts," Bean said. The city 
would have to build a pipe system to channel the water to urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
The report also raises the possibility of drilling wells on the Mound Basin, 
which is beneath the area of the Ventura County government center. But this 
water, both Bean and Francis said, is high in dissolved minerals, especially 
iron and manganese. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks ugly, tastes ugly and stains the clothes," Bean said. "You could use 
it in an emergency, but people won't like it," she said. Francis added that the 
iron in the water would corrode the city's pipelines and that the manganese can 
cause health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility that will be studied involves pumping more water out of the 
Santa Clara Basin and the Fox Canyon Aquifer. The two solutions are related 
because the basin feeds the aquifer. Fox Canyon is an important source of water 
for the United Water District and the city of Oxnard. Ventura also has a well 
that draws on the aquifer, which is the source of some of the purest water in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
But Fox Canyon already is being overused, city officials have said. As a 
result, an underground vacuum effect is drawing sea water into the aquifer. For 
this reason, United is considering cutting back use of this water source. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the report is the possibility of purchasing water from the 
giant Municipal Water District, which supplies parts of Los Angeles, Orange, 
San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, including the city 
of Oxnard. This could be accomplished by bringing water from Oxnard to Lake 
Casitas. Santa Barbara has already begun negotiating to accomplish this and 
would be willing to share some of the water with Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura city Public Works Director Shelley Jones said that the water pipes 
bringing water into Oxnard are operating at full capacity already and may not 
be able to carry additional supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Francis added that such a project would involve reversing Ventura's water 
distribution system, which is geared to pump and flush water on a 
north-to-south and east-to-west direction. Such a reversal would pose 
significant technical problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative mentioned in the report would be to bring Ventura's 
allocation from the state water project from Piru Creek down the Santa Clara 
River. The city is studying the feasibility of building a pipeline to bring 
this water into the city, a project that could take up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said that using the Santa Clara River was a "fairly inefficient 
approach," because a sizable portion of the water would evaporate and be 
exposed to degradation and contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura city spokeswoman Carol Green said the city has yet to earmark funds or 
set deadlines for the consultant's study. She said the consultant was chosen 
because its Ventura office had worked with the city in the past and was 
familiar with its water problems.

CITY COUNCIL OKS DRASTICALLY CUT FUND FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following through on a vow to address the city's dire shortage of affordable 
homes, a bare majority of the San Diego City Council approved a $12.9-million 
trust fund Monday to create low-cost housing and provide rental subsidies for 
the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
But the funding, which establishes one of the key legislative initiatives of 
Councilman Wes Pratt and the council's more progressive majority, is less than 
25% of the $54 million earmarked when the program was first approved in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a looming budget crisis and strong opposition from four council 
members and some segments of the public, the five-member majority agreed Monday 
to raise funds from only two sources: $12 million from a fee on new commercial 
and industrial developments and $900,000 in hotel room taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Pratt called the 5-4 vote "one of the most important steps in the 
history of housing in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, finally, this city can say in good conscience that we believe in 
housing our working poor and are making efforts to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt was joined by Council Members Abbe Wolfsheimer, John Hartley, Linda 
Bernhardt and Bob Filner -- the same coalition that gave conceptual approval to 
the trust fund Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Council Members Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson and 
Judy McCarty opposed the measure, saying the trust fund should be considered 
this spring along with other city programs that will be competing for money in 
the midst of the city's budget crisis. City Manager John Lockwood has forecast 
an $60-million shortfall in the revenue needed to keep city services at current 
levels for the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tax," Roberts said. "It's one of the major taxes in the history of 
this city, and we're doing that in the face of a major budget deficit that we 
have to resolve." 
</P>
<P>
But Pratt served notice that he wants the council to consider adding money to 
the trust fund when it reviews next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson repeated his belief that most of the money will go to "income 
subsidies" rather than construction of new homes, an approach he condemned. 
</P>
<P>
"How many new housing units will there be (built) in this city from the $13 
million?" he asked. "I have the suspicion that the answer is zero." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, an 11-member board of trustees will distribute the money to a 
variety of programs, including nonprofit home builders, private developers 
willing to mix low-cost housing in with their developments, 
housing-rehabilitation projects, purchase of existing apartments and direct 
income subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees could allocate as much as $500,000 per project. The council still 
must decide whether larger expenditures must go before the city's Housing 
Commission for approval. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned by the Housing Commission, which sponsored the plan, 60% of the 
money would be spent on rental housing for families earning less than $18,250 
annually; 20% would go for rental housing for families earning between $18,250 
and $29,360; 10% would help families earning less than $36,700 buy their first 
homes, and 10% would pay for transitional housing for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has been called the nation's least-affordable rental market, based on 
the difference between the average income and the average rental price. 
According to the city's Planning Department, 80,000 families need affordable 
housing, and the number will increase by 4,500 annually. Yet the city has 
constructed just 258 apartments in their price range during the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, just 21% of San Diegans can afford to buy homes, according to one 
study. 
</P>
<P>
With the tourism industry and other business sectors continuing to bring the 
city an influx of low-paid service workers, "our biggest need in this city is 
for good old, garden-variety rental housing," said Evan Becker, the Housing 
Commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the funding for the program will come from a new fee to be 
assessed on all non-residential construction, beginning with final passage of 
the ordinance, expected next month. The fee ranges from 50 cents per square 
foot of newly built warehouse space to $2 per square foot of new office space. 
Hotels, research and development facilities, retail stores and manufacturing 
plants also will pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $12.9 million approved Monday, the council will later 
determine whether to transfer to the trust fund $4.5 million set aside for 
housing by the city's Redevelopment Agency. The transfer would direct the money 
to poorer residents and would allow its expenditure outside the downtown area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANDLORD SUES ACTRESS CORNELIA GUEST OVER 
RENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York socialite and aspiring actress Cornelia Guest was sued Monday for 
allegedly not paying the rent on her $5,000-per-month Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court by Guest's landlord, Marlene Morris, 
contends Guest failed to pay rent that was due March 1. Guest rented the house 
on Hutton Drive in May, 1989. In her suit, Morris is seeking to evict Guest and 
receive $25,000 in damages at the rate of $166.67 per day plus punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
Guest, whose renown is based in part on her being "Deb of the Year" of New York 
and a past romantic link to actor Sylvester Stallone, could not be reached for 
comment.

A 47-year-old man whom his relatives believed to be suicidal locked himself in 
his Thousand Oaks home Sunday and had to be cajoled for more than an hour into 
opening the door, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bill Montijo of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said the man, whom

The man's wife called police because she believed her husband might kill 
himself, Montijo said. Five officers spent more than an hour coaxing the man 
over the telephone into unlocking the door, he said.

BIT OF NAVY HISTORY IS FOUND INTACT ON SEA FLOOR OFF S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although searching the ocean floor for a downed helicopter 9 miles off the San 
Diego coast last fall, sailors found a rare F-3 biplane, a pre-World War II 
fighter that crashed 50 years ago, the Navy said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Though a civilian model is now housed in the Smithsonian Museum, this plane is 
believed to be the first military F-3 aircraft to survive the years, said 
Senior Chief Bob Howard, spokesman for the Pacific Fleet Naval Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real find," Howard said. "The pilot settled it down on the water, 
then it sunk. You've got this gorgeous old plane sitting down there in 
marvelous condition." 
</P>
<P>
The plane was piloted by then-Lt. Robert Edward Galer, now 76 and a Dallas 
resident, who was not hurt in the crash. Galer later won the Medal of Honor for 
leading his squadron to shoot down 27 Japanese planes during World War II. In 
Oct. 1942, Galer -- a member of Marine Unit 223 that was dubbed the "Flying 
Fools" -- downed 11 enemy bomber and fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
As Galer, who retired from the Marine Corps as a brigadier general, looks back 
on his 23 years of service, he is almost nostalgic about the F-3 crash, which 
he believes prepared him for being shot down several times in combat. 
</P>
<P>
"The biplane is very nice to fly -- it's very stable, though it's not very 
fast," said Galer. "And it's very forgiving. You could make a mistake and still 
recover." 
</P>
<P>
But on Aug. 29, 1940 at 12:30 p.m., Galer made no mistake. Two pilots had 
reported having trouble aboard the aircraft. The engineering crew on the 
aircraft carrier Saratoga believed they had fixed the ill-fated plane and Galer 
was assigned to try it out. 
</P>
<P>
After taking off, he checked the fuel tanks several times, according to an 
accident report filed after the crash. Galer took off using the reserve fuel 
supply and flew several minutes before attempting to switch to the auxiliary 
fuel supply. As he tried to switch from one tank to another, the engine began 
to sputter, according to the report. Still switching from tank to tank, Galer 
realized he was in trouble and gave the forced-landing signal. At about 1,000 
feet, he was able to hold to the landing pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"I had gone through all the procedures, and it would not re-start. I had been 
flying long enough and seen enough planes go down that it wasn't a complete 
surprise," Galer said. "I figured I would make a smooth landing in the water 
and the destroyer would pick me up. You're too busy to be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
As Galer struggled, another pilot -- Marine LtN. Endweiss -- spotted black 
smoke coming from Galer's plane. Unable to help, Endweiss watched as Galer 
smacked into the water. Circling in the air, he waited to see Galer, who 
signaled that he wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was typical San Diego water -- it was very nice," said Galer, who hit the 
water about 300 yards astern of the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the crash, the biplane had 16 gallons of fuel. It stayed afloat 
five minutes before sinking. On Oct. 31, the Navy gave up on the plane and 
struck it from their records as lost. 
</P>
<P>
And it stayed on the sea bottom. Last fall, a deep submergence vehicle, called 
a "turtle," stumbled upon the airplane as sailors were conducting routine 
operations and searching for a helicopter that had crashed in October, claiming 
two lives. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials expect to pluck the plane from the water during early April, 
after they retrieve the sunken helicopter. The plane will be taken first to 
North Island Naval Air Station's Naval Depot for preliminary rehabilitative 
work and then to San Diego's Air and Space Museum for further attention. 
Eventually, it will be housed in the Naval Air Museum in Pensacola, Fla., 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
During 23 years in the Marines, Galer was shot down three times during World 
War II and another time in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the ocean landing near San Diego, "that makes five times, and my son 
says that makes me an ace," joked Galer, laughing.

<P>
Two Los Angeles men have been arrested in Oxnard in the transportation and sale 
of counterfeit music tapes, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Vulfrano Hernandez, 31, was arrested Sunday at 1:30 p.m., after police saw him 
allegedly selling tapes from a car near Del Sol Park, said Oxnard Police Lt. 
Stan Myers. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes were counterfeit, Myers said, and Hernandez was charged with 
knowingly selling and transporting them. 
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, police saw Cresencio Arroyo, 19, of Los Angeles selling tapes 
from a dolly near Colonia Park. Police said the tapes were counterfeit. 
</P>
<P>
Police seized 1,100 tapes during the two arrests that are believed to be 
related, Myers said. CAROL WATSON

2ND AIRLINE TO BEGIN SERVICE TO PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Skywest Airlines will become the second carrier to serve Palmdale Regional 
Airport, flying five round trips a day to Los Angeles International Airport 
starting June 1, the airline announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Skywest -- a feeder service for Delta Airlines -- follows 
the start Jan. 2 of service by America West Airlines. America West's four daily 
round trips between Palmdale and Las Vegas ended a five-year absence of air 
service from the Palmdale airport, which is operated by the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Skywest plans to use 19-passenger Fairchild Metro III turboprop planes for the 
30-minute flights to LAX. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought the time was right to establish a link between Palmdale and 
Los Angeles," said Steve Hart, Skywest's director of market planning. 
"Obviously having America West reestablish service there will help us. We sort 
of hope to run on their coattails," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Skywest officials said they saw a market in the Antelope Valley, with its 
fast-growing population of about 200,000 and concentration of military and 
aerospace businesses. Airport officials, however, said both carriers' services 
mainly strive to capture passengers for their connecting flights. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Board of Airport Commissioners is scheduled to meet in 
Palmdale on Wednesday to approve a five-year lease for Skywest. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Department of Airports officials applauded Skywest's decision as a 
step toward development of Palmdale's airport. But they also said they had 
hoped the next carrier at Palmdale would have avoided feeding already-crowded 
LAX. 
</P>
<P>
Skywest, which carried about 1 million passengers last year, serves 43 cities 
in eight Western states. The introductory Palmdale-LAX round trip fare will be 
$98. But airline officials said they expect most of their passengers to catch 
Delta flights at LAX, entitling them to pay little or nothing for the 
connecting flight beyond the price of the Delta ticket.

The Port Hueneme Elementary School District Monday accepted a bid from SOTA 
Electronics to supply computers, satellite dishes and other electronic 
equipment for use in the district's "smart classrooms" program. 
</P>
<P>
SOTA Electronics' bid of $753,000 -- $621,000 for equipment and $132,000 for 
software development -- was the lowest received by the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Smart classrooms are designed to provide advanced education to students in 
social studies, language arts, reading and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
There are four smart classrooms in Port Hueneme, but "we want to build three

STATE URGES RULES TO REQUIRE SEWERS IN RURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State water quality officials on Monday recommended sweeping regulations that 
would require developers to build sewers in new developments in rural 
communities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, a proposal that critics 
predicted would lead to overdevelopment of areas struggling to retain their 
country character. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations, if adopted, would apply to fast-growing areas that obtain 
their drinking water from local wells, such as Acton, Agua Dulce and Lake 
Hughes in Los Angeles County and the Santa Rosa Valley in Ventura County. The 
California Regional Water Quality Control Board for the Los Angeles region has 
jurisdiction over the two counties. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed recommendations would restrict the use of septic tanks, which 
control board officials said can cause ground water to be contaminated with 
nitrates occurring in sewage effluent. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrates from sewage do not harm adults but can produce the "blue-baby 
syndrome" in infants, a sometimes fatal condition that impairs the blood's 
capacity to carry oxygen, said Robert P. Ghirelli, the board's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Developers could comply with the proposed regulations by either building a 
self-contained sewage treatment system or by tying in to an existing system. 
</P>
<P>
While residents complained that the sewers would promote growth, developers 
contended that the new regulations would add as much as $25,000 to the cost of 
a new home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely controversial issue," Ghirelli said. "We have developers on 
one side thinking we're going too far and the community on the other side 
thinking we're overreacting -- then public agencies saying we're not doing 
enough to protect the public health." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations, presented to the control board Monday, would ban septic 
tanks for use on lots under 2 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Septic tanks could be used on lots between 2 and 5 acres, but sewer pipes that 
could later be made functional would have to be installed. That requirement is 
based on the assumption that the sewer might have to be activated some day, 
said Anne Saffel, an environmental specialist with the control board. 
</P>
<P>
Installation of sewers on lots larger than 5 acres would not be required, 
except when nitrate contamination is found, Saffel said. Current residents 
would not be subject to the sewer requirements, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the recommendations is scheduled April 23. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Acton Town Council, representing the town of 8,000 residents 
halfway between Santa Clarita and Palmdale, said the installation of sewers 
would allow unbridled development in the unincorporated community. Joel Levy, 
council president, also said that planning studies by Los Angeles County have 
said that as many as 24,000 Acton residents could safely rely on septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were prompted in part by the discovery of high nitrate 
levels in wells in Agua Dulce in the mid-1980s. Some wells had nitrate levels 
of 190 parts per million, far above the state safety guideline of 45 parts per 
million, Saffel said. The average well in Agua Dulce had 30 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
Agua Dulce residents, however, say that those findings are inflated and that 
nitrates are not a problem in their wells.

LANDFILL PAYMENTS PROPOSED;

<P>
COMPENSATION: TWO PUBLIC WORKS COMMISSIONERS SAY THE CITY SHOULD CONSIDER 
COMPENSATING RESIDENTS NEAR THE LOPEZ CANYON DUMP IF IT IS EXPANDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Challenging official city thinking, the Board of Public Works' two most junior 
members said Monday that the city of Los Angeles should consider compensating 
Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon residents if the city expands the nearby 
Lopez Canyon dump. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we owe these residents some compensation. We're dumping all our trash 
next to their homes and the rest of the city is benefiting. It's a question of 
fairness," Commissioner Percy Duran III said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Duran's remarks came after three of the five members of the board heard two 
hours of citizen complaints and criticism about an environmental impact report 
studying the effects of expanding the city-owned Lopez Canyon Landfill to 
handle a huge new influx of garbage through the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, previously the president of a solid waste recycling management firm, 
said compensation could take several forms: Payments to homeowners to account 
for the devaluation of their homes due to their proximity to the landfill; 
providing free electrical power to residents from a small generator fueled by 
methane gas produced by decaying garbage; or providing municipal amenities, 
such as parks. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Felicia Marcus, an environmental activist, also said in an 
interview that "providing new amenities" to the affected residents or otherwise 
"recognizing that they are shouldering the burden for the rest of the city . . 
. definitely needs to be seriously explored" as the board also considers the 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon residents have complained that the dump -- 
which receives most of the household trash collected by city crews and is the 
only facility of its kind remaining in the city's limits -- afflicts neighbors 
with noise, dust and odors, reducing their property values. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion plan would keep the landfill open until 2005, although critics 
have said the city earlier promised, at least by implication, that the dump 
would close by 1992. The plan also would increase the intensity of dumping, 
from 400 to 650 truckloads of garbage per day. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the landfill, including Councilman Ernani Bernardi, the area's 
representative, said the two commissioners' remarks signal a major shift in 
Board of Public Works thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good idea, a very good idea. It's most welcome and unusual," Bernardi 
said. "The dump should be viewed as a form of inverse condemnation." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrific concept and it's a long time in coming," said Rob Zapple, a 
member of the Kagel Canyon Civic Assn. board of directors, a group that has led 
the fight against expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Hines, president of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., a 
homeowners group, welcomed the suggestions. "If we can't stop the expansion, 
then I think it's a good idea for the city to soften the burden," Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
Within the ranks of Lopez Canyon's foes there has been talk before about 
compensation, including a property tax discount for affected homeowners, "but 
this is the first I've ever heard it coming from people in a position to make 
decisions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of the board's five commissioners were present at Monday's lengthy 
hearing, during which 21 people commented on the EIR. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the board postponed a vote on the EIR was hailed as a victory by 
critics, even before they learned of the compensation suggestion. The city's 
Bureau of Sanitation had recommended that the board endorse Lopez Canyon 
expansion and send its recommendation on to the Los Angeles City Council for 
final approval. 
</P>
<P>
But Duran and Marcus balked, saying at the board meeting that they still had 
many unanswered questions about the project and the EIR's analysis of its 
impacts. 
</P>
<P>
Commission President Steve Harrington set no date for a final vote on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, who is also an attorney, said any compensation should not be conditioned 
upon the homeowners waiving their right to sue the city or otherwise acquiesce 
in the expansion. "Any money would not function as a buyout of their 
criticism," he said.

SIMI VALLEY CONTINUATION SCHOOL SUPPLEMENTS THE 3 RS WITH 4 A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of Apollo High School say learning the three Rs is based on the four 
A's -- affection, attention, acceptance and appreciation. And they get on-site 
guidance from Canoga Park psychiatrist and writer William Glasser. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley continuation school's program is explicitly based on Glasser's 
ideas. For the past two years he has been paying it periodic visits, talking 
with students and teachers about his techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of schools will tell you, 'Well, we would be able to teach the children 
if they came from better homes or better backgrounds,' " Glasser said Monday on 
a visit. He visits the school on a volunteer basis about twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
"And to some extent that's true. But if a kid comes from a bad home, that's all 
the more reason to provide a loving and friendly environment. We have no 
control over the home. But we have 100% control over how we treat kids in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach teachers from the very beginning to talk to students in a 
non-adversarial manner, how to approach them without a chip on your shoulder. 
If a school is managed with coercion, there's going to be a discipline 
problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glasser, whose Institute for Reality Therapy is in Canoga Park, is the author 
of several books on teaching, including "Reality Therapy," published in 1965. 
His latest book, "The Quality School," is dedicated to Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Greene, Apollo's principal and an admirer of Glasser's work, invited the 
psychiatrist two years ago to work directly with the school. He said he 
successfully applied Glasser's techniques for several years at Apollo, where he 
has been principal since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
According to Greene, most of Apollo's 360 students were failing at other 
schools or were on the verge of dropping out before transferring. Some have a 
history of disciplinary or substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
One example of Glasser method is that fighting is not punished. It leads to 
counseling sessions. Using drugs or alcohol at school produces an introduction 
to an on-campus Alcoholics Anonymous or similar program. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the classes have no more than 20 students, which allows more 
interaction with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Here the teachers are your friends, not just your teachers," said 19-year-old 
George Evrard, who transferred to Apollo three years ago from Simi Valley High 
School. "They all care about you. They all want you to succeed in life." 
</P>
<P>
Classes mingle students of different age groups. Desks have been replaced with 
couches and tables, and students are encouraged to plant gardens and paint 
murals on school property. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of our belief is that when students have some ownership in the school, 
they take care of it," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Greene cited a 1985-88 survey that found that 78% of Apollo's students improved 
their attendance and 86% graduated. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're doing more to measure our success based on what students do after 
they graduate," Greene said. "As an example, I had one student come back and 
teach on the staff. We have a number of graduates who are teachers. We have 
students who are probation officers. And some of those kids who are probation 
officers were on probation when they were here." 
</P>
<P>
"The Quality School" presents arguments for using Glasser's techniques 
everywhere, but in Simi Valley some school officials say the methods wouldn't 
travel well. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley High School Principal David L. Ellis said classes at most schools 
are crowded and the demands on teachers too great. Ellis said although the 
"more relaxed" atmosphere at Apollo might work for some students, it would 
probably serve as a distraction for others. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. John Duncan said he also believed that the program could not be 
applied at other schools for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Glasser countered by saying his methods will anywhere that the principal is 
committed to them.

OFFICIAL'S HOUSE FIRE WAS SET, INVESTIGATORS TESTIFY

<P>
The trial of an Antelope Valley water board member accused of setting afire his 
Lancaster home began Monday with arson investigators testifying that the fire 
at the trash-strewn home appeared to have been set intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Martin, 67, a 14-year elected member of the Antelope Valley-East Kern 
Water Agency was charged with a single count of arson in the fire last July. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 14 years, the former World War II fighter pilot has had several 
of run-ins with Lancaster officials over junk accumulating on his property, for 
which he has been convicted twice under the city's nuisance law. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who is acting as his own lawyer in the non-jury trial before Lancaster 
Superior Court Judge Margaret Grignon, said in an interview Monday that the 
arson charge is false and politically motivated. He limited his opening 
argument in court to a single sentence: "With my God as my witness, I did not 
torch my house." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Damon said Martin's allegations that the charge stems 
from a conspiracy by political rivals are "nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Three witnesses testified that evidence indicated the fire started in a 
different part of Martin's living room from the sofa he said was the point of 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
The intensity and nature of the fire damage conflicted with Martin's account of 
an accidental sofa fire, which Martin said he noticed from another room about 
15 minutes after he had been seated on the sofa eating lunch, witnesses 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire was set by human hands applying an open flame to combustibles such as 
trash or newspapers," testified Los Angeles County Sheriff's Arson Investigator 
Terry Danielson. He disputed Martin's version that the fire had been caused by 
smoking material or an electrical short, saying the damage pattern did not fit 
either cause. 
</P>
<P>
A gasoline can was found in the debris, the investigators testified. said. 
Danielson and other witnesses testified Martin told them he was using it as a 
doorstop. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said in an interview that he had no reason to burn his own house, which 
contained what he called cherished World War II memorabilia, including photos 
and a uniform. He brought some of the memorabilia to court as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he had an $83,000 insurance policy on the home, but said 
an insurance company investigator will testify that there were no signs of 
arson.

MAN GETS LIFE IN PRISON FOR SLAYING DISC JOCKEY

<P>
A 22-year-old Compton man was sentenced Monday to life in prison without parole 
for fatally shooting a self-employed disc jockey to steal a van filled with 
expensive stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith Meisels Ashmann sentenced Roger Moore Jr. 
to the maximum sentence sought by prosecutors for the Oct. 15, 1988, killing of 
Joseph Brosta, 41, of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was found guilty of first-degree murder by a Van Nuys Superior Court jury 
on Feb. 26. The jury also convicted him of the special-circumstance allegation 
of committing a murder during a robbery, which allowed prosecutors to seek the 
death penalty or life in prison without parole. They sought the latter. 
</P>
<P>
An accomplice of Moore's, Frederick Kelly, 22, also of Compton, pleaded guilty 
to being an accessory to the murder and testified against Moore. Moore 
confessed to police that he shot Brosta. 
</P>
<P>
A third man, Erin Blunt, 23, of Carson, also faces murder charges in Brosta's 
death. Blunt's preliminary hearing is scheduled for April. 
</P>
<P>
Brosta's body was found in an alley behind his home in the 7900 block of White 
Oak Avenue about 2:30 a.m. He had been shot in the chest with a .12-gauge 
shotgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Brosta was returning from a job as disc jockey at a 
dance at St. Francis High School and Seminary in La Canada-Flintridge, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert P. Imerman said. 
</P>
<P>
While fleeing in Brosta's van, the three men allegedly rammed a Los Angeles 
police car, which they mistakenly believed was chasing them, Imerman said. The 
car actually was answering an unrelated call. The men abandoned the vehicle and 
escaped on foot, but Moore's fingerprints were found inside, Imerman said.

Southern California Gas Co. on Monday announced that its previously wasted 
heaps of white paper scrap -- memos, letters, and assorted bureaucratic 
leftovers -- will be separated and recycled in a model program that officials 
hope other businesses will imitate. But in fact, such recycling programs are 
now "very common throughout Los Angeles," said Joan Edwards, director of the 
city's integrated solid waste management office. 
</P>
<P>
"Many paper dealers offer this service. It's their bread and butter." A news 
conference in Chatsworth featured Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus 
helping to dump sheets of used white paper into a large bin for collection by a 
private recycling contractor. Under the plan, used white paper from the gas 
company office will be sold to the recycler, with a portion of the money going 
to a volunteer service organization in Van Nuys.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 44-year-old woman was hospitalized after suffering smoke inhalation Monday 
during an early-morning fire in a condominium complex in Chula Vista, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's 16-year-old daughter escaped injury by jumping out a window of the 
second-floor apartment at 630 Telegraph Canyon Road, said Carol Gove, a deputy 
Chula Vista fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
The two-alarm fire broke out about 3:20 a.m. and was extinguished two hours 
later, Gove said. About 20 residents of the eight-unit complex were evacuated, 
none of them were injured. But a dog that was in the second-story living room 
died, Gove said. 
</P>
<P>
The living room, dining room and kitchen of the apartment were damaged 
extensively, Gove said, adding that the fire traveled through an attic and into 
a next door apartment. Two first-floor apartments where damaged by water. She 
said damage to the four apartments was estimated at more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that the fire started in a chair in the living room and was 
caused by "smoking materials," Gove said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospitalized woman, Carmen Rodriguez, ran out the front door; she also 
suffered slight burns on her face and chest, and singed her hair, Gove said. 
Rodriguez was taken to Chula Vista Community Hospital, where she was listed in 
stable condition.

SEMINAR ON PREJUDICE TEACHES STUDENTS ABOUT THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tamika Westfield, a black teen-ager at Canyon High School, recalled with 
exasperation a question by fellow students at the predominantly white campus in 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
"People asked me if I was in a gang because I wore a Raiders jacket," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students around her laughed, shaking their heads and rolling their eyes in 
disbelief. But other students nodded knowingly. It's hard to wear black and not 
be called a gang member, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Westfield and 99 other Canyon students shared other stories of insensitive 
remarks, double standards, sexism, stereotypes and blatant bigotry during a 
daylong seminar designed to promote cultural understanding at the high school. 
By day's end students drafted a plan to promote racial harmony on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes funny, sometimes eerily moving, the seminar forced students to 
evaluate how they view and behave toward others unlike themselves. The ethnic 
composition of the campus is changing, said social science teacher Julia 
Howelman, and school officials hope the seminar will help prevent ethnic 
conflicts from erupting in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's do something before it happens," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With a minority population of 21.4%, Canyon High is the most culturally diverse 
campus in the William S. Hart Union High School District, said English teacher 
Jody Monteleone. The percentage of minority students is small compared to the 
inner city, but the campus is a rare common ground for different races in the 
predominantly white Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The demographics of the valley, however, are slowly changing. Ten years ago, 
one of every 300 students at Canyon was black, Howelman said. Today, one of 
every 40 is black. One out of every six students is Latino, almost twice the 
ratio of 10 years ago, Howelman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 students were nominated by teachers to attend the seminar, which 
included group discussions, videotapes on racism and stereotypes, and a somber 
speech by David Okasaki, a teacher from Saugus High School who told how his 
parents were imprisoned in an internment camp for Japanese-Americans during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in a concentration camp," he began, "an American concentration 
camp." The room, earlier that morning filled with laughter when students 
discussed the moral implications of ethnic jokes, fell silent as students 
listened to Okasaki describe how the memories and shame of the camps scarred 
his parents' lives and his. 
</P>
<P>
"As I grew up, I didn't like who I was," he said. "I didn't like being 
Japanese." He and his family had to prove they were Americans after the camp, 
he said. His voice tinged with regret, he said he never learned to speak 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
During a group discussion, some students complained that some teachers 
occasionally make ethnic jokes. The teachers recently attended a seminar that 
was similar to the program, and Monteleone said she hoped that session had 
influenced the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"If your teachers have been telling ethnic jokes in class, I hope that's 
stopped," she said. "If your teachers are doing that in class, if you are 
offended, I hope you tell them." 
</P>
<P>
Students confronted their own prejudices as well. "I'm not that prejudiced -- 
only gays," said James Brimidge, 18, a senior. "That's the only thing." 
</P>
<P>
Brimidge, who is black, also complained that he, like Westfield, had been 
judged by his clothes and the color of his skin. "The way I dress is different, 
and they immediately thought I was in a gang," he said of other students. 
</P>
<P>
Howelman conceded that "we have a real gang fear up here." Some parents 
recently asked school officials if Canyon had gang problems because Latino 
students were gathering in front of the school to socialize, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very much aware that this community does have prejudices that you've 
gotten from your parents and other adults," Howelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, maybe we should start teaching parents," said John Bibi, 17, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something you guys can do," Howelman replied.

HARRIS FILES LAST-DITCH PLEA FOR HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON and DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Condemned killer Robert Alton Harris filed a last-ditch appeal Monday with the 
federal court in San Diego as Mother Teresa made a seemingly unsuccessful plea 
for his life in a telephone call to Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
After the five-minute phone call with the Nobel Prize-winning missionary, the 
governor issued a statement in Sacramento emphasizing that he has a 
responsibility to carry out the law under which Harris was sentenced to die. 
The execution, which would be the first in California in 23 years, is scheduled 
for next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from India, Mother Teresa prevailed on the governor to "do what Jesus 
would do if Jesus was in your position," according to an intermediary who spoke 
with the nun shortly after the call. But Deukmejian told her that the public 
has decided that, in California, the death penalty is a "just and appropriate" 
punishment for murderers. 
</P>
<P>
In Harris' legal papers, the first step in the last legal procedure Harris has 
left, his San Diego attorneys contended that new psychiatric evidence shows 
that Harris suffered from brain damage that played a part in the killings. It 
would be unfair to execute Harris because that damage was not taken into 
account when he was sentenced, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge William B. Enright in San Diego, who initially has handled 
-- and rejected -- Harris' previous appeals in federal court, set a hearing in 
the case for Wednesday. The new appeal essentially sets forth the same 
arguments that failed to persuade the California Supreme Court earlier this 
month to spare the 37-year-old Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' case has progressed further through the court system than that of any 
of the other more than 270 prisoners on Death Row in California. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected Harris' appeals four times, most recently 
on Jan. 16. The California Supreme Court upheld Harris' death sentence in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, the state Supreme Court turned down an appeal Harris' San Diego 
attorneys, Charles M. Sevilla and Michael McCabe, had filed Jan. 5. The 
justices unanimously declined to grant a formal hearing to Harris to review his 
claim that new psychiatric evidence indicates he suffers brain damage that 
affected his behavior in the 1978 killings. 
</P>
<P>
That rejection left Harris with only two avenues for relief, a grant of 
clemency from Deukmejian or a reprieve from the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, however, Harris retracted his application for a clemency hearing 
before Deukmejian. In a letter to the governor, Harris said he had decided not 
to seek clemency because he did not think he could get a fair hearing from 
Deukmejian, a longtime advocate of capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Deukmejian canceled the hearing. That same day, Mother Teresa, 
working through a Jesuit seminarian from Berkeley, announced that she intended 
to call the governor to personally plead for Harris' life. 
</P>
<P>
After Monday's call, John Dear, the Berkeley seminarian, described Mother 
Teresa as "very concerned" and "totally absorbed in praying for the governor to 
stop the execution." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian was alone in his office when he spoke to the Roman Catholic nun, who 
won the Nobel Prize in 1979 for her work on behalf of the sick and dying in 
Calcutta's slums. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Deukmejian issued a statement saying that Mother Teresa expressed 
her views based on religious grounds. 
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Deukmejian told Mother Teresa said that capital 
punishment "has been fully debated for many years in California" and that the 
public has voted on two occasions "that the death penalty is a just and 
appropriate punishment for those who willfully murder another person." 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he concluded the call "by expressing his respect for Mother 
Teresa and her work, and thanked her for her views." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa met Harris at San Quentin during a visit to Death Row inmates in 
1987. During the visit, she gave him a medal to wear and promised to pray for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In turning Monday to the federal court in San Diego, Harris' lawyers said that, 
although there no longer is any debate over what Harris did, it would be unjust 
to kill him because it was not clear that he had a fair chance to explain why 
he killed the two boys, Michael Baker and John Mayeski. 
</P>
<P>
Harris killed both 16-year-old boys after stealing their car for use in a bank 
robbery. He abducted them from a fast-food parking lot where they had just 
ordered lunch. Later, he ate their half-finished hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
What neither Harris nor his lawyers knew in 1979, when he was sentenced, was 
that he suffered from a variety of mental disorders, his attorneys said in the 
papers they filed Monday. Among them, they said, was post-traumatic stress 
disorder, the condition usually associated with combat. 
</P>
<P>
No one knew about the disorders because the psychologists who tested Harris in 
1979 didn't do a good job, his lawyers said Monday. And, in 1979, psychiatrists 
didn't even recognize a condition like post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"In a case that cried out for the assistance of competent experts -- who could 
see beneath the veneer of Mr. Harris' 'meanness' and reveal the confused, 
anguished soul of a man whose parents' violence destroyed much of his life's 
potential in infancy and set him adrift, rudderless, in a turbulent social sea 
-- there was no expert," the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of Harris' disorders is that he is driven "powerfully by impulse," 
has great difficulty remembering social rules and conventions and is "limited" 
in his ability to perceive others with empathy and compassion, the lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At Harris' sentencing hearing, the prosecution's expert psychiatrist painted 
Harris as "one who freely chose to kill for pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
But, with the "revelations" of Harris' mental conditions, his crime takes on a 
"very different quality," the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Every sequence -- the car theft, killings and bank robbery -- was driven by 
impulse, the attorneys said. Those impulses fed on each other but were 
uncontrollable, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Since evidence of Harris' mental disorders wasn't presented in 1979 but would 
provide powerful mitigating evidence, Harris deserves a full hearing to prove 
his claims about the effect of the disorders, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Enright agrees to grant that request, he must also decide to put off 
the execution because the date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, in denying Harris' first federal appeal, Enright called Harris' death 
sentence an "appropriate and deserved penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday afternoon, Harris' attorneys asked that another San Diego federal 
judge handle the newly filed appeal. Enright told them at a brief hearing that, 
under the San Diego court's rules, the case had to be assigned to him, the 
judge's law clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
If Enright denies the appeal again, Harris must turn to the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals, the San Francisco-based federal appellate court that serves 
nine Western states and Guam.

CLIPPERS SEND TIMBERWOLVES PACKING; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THEY END FIVE-GAME LOSING STREAK, 101-96 IN OVERTIME, AND GET 
EVEN FOR LOSS TO EXPANSION TEAM EARLIER THIS MONTH.

<P>
After losing to the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves earlier this month, and 
after a 33-point loss Saturday to the Utah Jazz, the Clippers needed a victory 
over Minnesota Monday night to regain some confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Game 70, Charles Smith said, was crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"With the losses and the bad display against Utah, when nothing went right," he 
said after the Clippers ended a five-game losing streak, 101-96 in overtime at 
the Sports Arena, "this was a definite boost for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers (27-43) earned it. They made all three field-goal attempts and 
seven of nine free throws in overtime, Danny Manning getting six of his 26 
points then. 
</P>
<P>
With the Timberwolves supplying their usual solid defense, the score was 88-88 
with 53 seconds remaining. The Clippers picked this as their time to waste 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
First, Ken Norman cut to the basket as Manning threw him a pass. The ball 
sailed untouched into the Minnesota bench. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves couldn't capitalize, Tyrone Corbin's attempt from the right 
side missing with two seconds left on the shot clock and about 17 left overall. 
The Clippers rebounded and brought the ball upcourt and didn't notice Coach Don 
Casey standing at mid-court screaming for a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"Next time, we're planning to shoot flares up for timeout calls," Casey said 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Winston Garland launched a straight-away three-point attempt. That 
missed, and when Sam Mitchell grabbed the rebound, Minnesota called a timeout 
with 4 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves' final try to avoid overtime was a turnaround jumper by Tony 
Campbell as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
That shot missed, too, as neither team scored in the final 2:05 of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, which beat the Clippers by 18 points in their last meeting, March 8 
at Minneapolis, warmed up for the rematch by shocking Portland Sunday night. 
Twenty-four hours later, in the final stop of a six-game trip, the Timberwolves 
led almost from the start. 
</P>
<P>
En route to a 50-46 advantage at halftime, they never trailed by more than one 
point, and that was in the opening quarter. From 17-16, the Timberwolves set 
the pace, helped, of course, by 67% shooting (10 of 15) in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's lead went to eight points, 58-50, midway through the third quarter, 
but the Clippers cut that down within minutes. They tied the score several 
times and finally went ahead, 69-67, when Smith made two free throws with 30 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves got a free throw from Scott Roth with 23 seconds left to make 
it a one-point game. That's where it stayed until the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper will return the final week of the season, even if only to watch. The 
Clipper guard, who has been rehabilitating his injured right knee close to home 
in Cleveland since undergoing reconstructive surgery Jan. 23, is expected at 
the Sports Arena for the April 21 season finale against the Lakers and might 
also make it to Golden State or Seattle on the trip that precedes the Laker 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's much more mobile now," agent Mark Termini said. "Everything is going real 
good, and Ron said he wanted to be part of the team again." 
</P>
<P>
The trip will also have business overtones -- Termini plans to meet with 
Clipper officials to begin formal negotiations on a new contract. Harper will 
become a restricted free agent after this season. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Garland suffered bruises on his left hip, neck and head after a fall 
with 2:02 to play in overtime. He reported soreness after the game and will be 
checked again today. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin did not start after missing the morning shoot-around. Charles 
Smith opened at center, giving the Clippers their 20th starting lineup in 70 
games. Benjamin said he had personal business. . . . The Clippers and the 
Lakers will play Wednesday at the Sports Arena.

DUMARS SIDELINED FOR AT LEAST 4 WEEKS

Guard Joe Dumars of the Detroit Pistons will miss at least four weeks after 
breaking the same hand he broke last year, the team said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, averaging a career-best 18.4 points per game, suffered a fracture of 
the third metacarpal bone in his left hand when he tried to break a fall during 
Saturday's 105-98 loss at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
"When it first happened, I thought, 'Oh my God!' It was the same area of the 
hand that I hurt last year," Dumars said. "I can't even hold this piece of 
paper in this hand -- it's too heavy." 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, 26, is in his fifth year in the league. He was a member of the NBA 
Eastern Conference All-Stars last month and was most valuable player of last 
year's NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in four games over the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons haven't decided who will replace Dumars on the roster, Piston 
spokesman Matt Dobek said.

SLUMPING TRAIL BLAZERS STILL CONFIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Adelman's preferred scenario would have had his Portland Trail Blazers 
storming into tonight's game against the Lakers on a 13-game winning streak and 
only a game or two behind. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Trail Blazers have lost two of three -- including a five-point 
loss at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves Sunday night -- and trail the Lakers 
by four games in the loss column. Their recent 10-game winning streak seems 
ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
Now, what the Portland coach had figured would be a two-game showdown against 
the Lakers this week has become a salvage operation. Adelman calls tonight's 
home game against the Lakers and Friday's rematch at the Forum the most 
important games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to put that game behind us," Adelman said. "We can't let (the 
Minnesota loss) affect us. It's a big game coming up, and we have to be ready 
if we're going to have any chance to catch them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to stay close all season, and this is our time to make the 
move. It's been our goal all season to get to the point where we're playing 
well going into April." 
</P>
<P>
Until Sunday, the Trail Blazers were headed that way. But Adelman, ever 
optimistic, still likes his team's chances. The Trail Blazers used to think 
they could beat the Lakers; now, they know they can. 
</P>
<P>
That confidence boost came on Feb. 14 at the Forum, when the Trail Blazers 
repelled several Laker threats and emerged with a 132-128 double-overtime 
victory. It was the first time in 10 meetings that Portland had beaten the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, had guard Terry Porter not missed a free throw with less than a second 
left in regulation, the Lakers would have lost a week earlier in Portland. 
Instead, they pulled out a 121-119 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we sent a message to the Lakers by winning that game," Adelman 
said. "I think we sent a message to ourselves. We lost that tough game up here 
(in Portland), then a week later we go down there (to the Forum), and that win 
told you what kind of character we had. 
</P>
<P>
"That win was a big turning point. It made us realize we could beat anybody 
anywhere. Our confidence soared after that." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, winners of eight consecutive Pacific Division titles, have taken 
the Trail Blazers seriously all season, and the double-overtime loss did 
nothing to change that. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Lakers might be disheartened to know that Adelman believes the 
Trail Blazers are a better team now, despite their recent slump. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we definitely are," Adelman said. "Our younger people are more 
consistent. We're better on the road. Our bench had been up and down. Lately, 
it's been more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"During that 10-game winning streak, we played as well as any team. A couple of 
those games, we weren't at the top of our game, but we took control in the 
fourth quarter. That's what good teams do. You can't always play your best, but 
you've got to take control." 
</P>
<P>
James and Diane Perkison have Laker season tickets in Section 31, Row 8 of the 
colonnade seating at the Forum. Are these seats each worth $14.50 a game? 
</P>
<P>
Sure. 
</P>
<P>
Is each worth $60 a game? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think so," Diane Perkison said. "Maybe corporations can afford to pay 
that, but not the individual fan." 
</P>
<P>
As reported last week, Forum officials are once again changing some 
season-ticket seats into Senate seats. The Senate program entitles the seat 
holder to attend all Forum events -- Lakers, Kings and most concerts -- for a 
total of $8,150 a year. 
</P>
<P>
For next season, 455 colonnade seats and 190 loge seats are being converted to 
Senate seats. Laker season ticket-holders were informed of the change in a 
March 6 letter. The Perkisons and others in colonnade seating were told they 
could keep their seats by paying $60 a game -- a $45.50 increase. One 
alternative is relocation to seats farther away, for either $22.50 or $11.50 a 
seat. Another alternative is to purchase Senate seats for $8,150. The final 
alternative is to drop the season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled King fans had their say last week. Now, Laker fans are speaking up. 
Charles L. Kreindler, a season ticket-holder, recently wrote in a letter to The 
Times' sports editor: "Jerry Buss . . . has essentially ensured that only the 
'elite' people of L.A. will be able to see the Lakers (and the Kings) live." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Steiner, a spokesman for Buss, said Senate seating is an important 
revenue-producer. But Steiner also said the Lakers do not make a profit merely 
from gate receipts. 
</P>
<P>
"For 11 years, Jerry Buss' revenue from ticket income and his payroll for the 
front office and players has been a wash," Steiner said. "It has not been a 
haphazard increase. The Lakers clearly have the highest payroll in the league, 
and many people don't realize what it costs to operate a highly expensive 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-five percent of (Laker) seats will have no increase next season. Forty 
percent of those seats still cost $11.50 or cheaper. Of the seats that have had 
a price increase, 21% of those seats had an increase of $5 or less. So, the 
only people really heavily hit are the 455 in the colonnade. We can understand 
the unhappiness of those people." 
</P>
<P>
The Perkisons said a petition was recently passed around Section 31 of the 
colonnade. But they say they realize it will not prevent the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"As for me," Kreindler wrote in his letter, "Sports Arena, here I come." 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
After several games in which he had fewer than two assists, rookie center David 
Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs was criticized by Coach Larry Brown for his 
stinginess in passing. "He gets tangled up with double-teams and sometimes 
triple-teams and forces the ball up," Brown told a San Antonio reporter. After 
Robinson totaled 11 assists in two games last week, Robinson reportedly 
approached Brown on the bus heading to the team's hotel in Seattle. "All 
right," Robinson said, jokingly, "now what more do I have to do to get rid of 
that black-hole nickname?" 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Hawk Coach Mike Fratello, whose contract expires after this season, has 
long been rumored on his way out. But Stan Kasten, the Hawks' president, said 
he has yet to decide Fratello's fate. "I can tell you categorically that there 
is only one man who will make the decision on whether Mike Fratello is offered 
a new contract, and I am that man," Kasten told the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. "If (owner) Ted Turner wants to know if Mike will be 
back, he will hear it from me. Anyone who tells you that Mike is gone is a 
liar. I make the decision and I haven't decided what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the first half of last Wednesday's game between the New Jersey 
Nets and the Washington Bullets, Net Coach Bill Fitch summoned forward Chris 
Morris to the sideline. According to the New York Daily News, Morris let loose 
with a string of invectives directed toward Fitch and team management. At 
halftime, in the privacy of the locker room, Fitch reportedly asked Morris to 
repeat what he said, then yanked Morris' jersey and suspended him for two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana Pacer forward Chuck Person, upset with his team's Central Division 
collapse, recently chartered a deep-sea boat in Miami, where the Pacers had 
three days off. Person called a team meeting at sea and, according to the 
Indianapolis News, the Pacers returned with two barracuda and a new attitude. 
Chartering the boat cost Person $2,000. It was money well spent, apparently. 
The Pacers have won three consecutive games.

"Certainly, World Cup games will be played in Naples after all, but I can

Lucille Gathers, mother of the late Loyola Marymount player, Hank Gathers, said 
she rooted for Loyola against Nevada Las Vegas Sunday despite misgivings about 
how officials handled the situation when her son collapsed during a game and 
died March 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they did all they could have done," she told the Philadelphia 
Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just standing around, and nobody was doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister got to the floor a couple of minutes before I did, when he went 
down, and when I got there, she was screaming, 'Do something! Somebody do 
something!' And when I got there, I started screaming too. It just seemed like 
nobody was doing anything. Just standing around." 
</P>
<P>
Of Loyola's 131-101 loss in the NCAA West Regional final, she said: "This 
wouldn't have happened if Hank had been there. He always gave 200%. Him and Bo 
(Kimble). It was the Hank and Bo Show."

It was a story that captivated a city, if not the country. 
</P>
<P>
Little Loyola Marymount, which has trouble even getting on television and 
doesn't have a regular radio station for its basketball broadcasts, became an 
overnight prime-time hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' NCAA tournament game against Alabama Friday night, televised on 
Channel 2, got an L.A. Nielsen rating of 12.0, more than double the 5.5 the 
Lakers and Clippers drew on Channel 5 the same night.

And the Lions' game against Nevada Las Vegas Sunday got an 11.8 and an 
impressive 33% share of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Other weekend NCAA tournament ratings: 5.1 for Duke-Connecticut and 6.6 for 
Arkansas-Texas on Saturday, and 7.7 for Georgia Tech-Minnesota on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, after a good night on Thursday, irritated many Los Angeles viewers Friday 
night by ignoring most of the second half of an exciting UNLV-Ball State game. 
</P>
<P>
The network, which decides which region gets which games, got into a bind when 
it switched to the nip-and-tuck Georgia Tech-Michigan State game, and got into 
more of a bind when that game went into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
CBS appeared to be doing the right thing when it switched to Georgia 
Tech-Michigan State, but it did the wrong thing by not switching back to 
UNLV-Ball State for at least some updates. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, that game probably had more interest in Los Angeles than Georgia 
Tech-Michigan State, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The week before, CBS didn't leave a lopsided Michigan State-UC Santa Barbara 
game in favor of showing North Carolina's stunning upset of Oklahoma because, 
the network said, UCSB is a Southern California team. 
</P>
<P>
But UNLV probably has a bigger following in Southern California than UCSB. And 
considering that the winner between UNLV and Ball State would face Loyola, CBS 
should have made sure Los Angeles got more news of that game. 
</P>
<P>
An often-heard complaint about CBS' coverage of the tournament is that the 
announcers hardly ever give the score, and the graphics people are lax about 
putting it on the screen. It should be shown after every basket. It only takes 
a second. 
</P>
<P>
It's such a simple thing, yet the network just can't seem to get it right. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are no complaints about the job the announcers on 
Loyola's campus FM station, KXLU, did during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Those listening to KXLU, which for a campus station has a pretty strong signal, 
got the score after every basket. 
</P>
<P>
Play-by-play man Keith Forman, commentator Brian Berger and Eric Johnson, the 
halftime host, are college students, but their work was very professional. 
</P>
<P>
Forman, a junior, was especially outstanding, outshining a lot of big-time 
network announcers. 
</P>
<P>
Forman's father, by the way, is Dr. Steve Forman of San Marino, the head of the 
hematology department at the City of Hope in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
From here on, it's relatively simple for CBS: Two games at one site on 
Saturday, then the title game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The first semifinal, Duke vs. Arkansas, will be shown at 2:30 p.m., with 
UNLV-Georgia Tech to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Musburger and Billy Packer will work both of those games, as well as the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
KLAC announced Monday it will carry CBS Radio's coverage of the semifinals and 
final. 
</P>

TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
ESPN has announced its schedule for baseball's opening day, April 9. At 11:30 
a.m., it will televise the Baltimore Orioles at the Kansas City Royals, then, 
in areas outside Southern California, it will join the San Diego Padres-Dodgers 
game at Dodger Stadium. That game must be blacked out in Los Angeles because 
SportsChannel is showing the game here. The nightcap on ESPN April 9 at 5:30 
p.m. will be the Toronto Blue Jays at the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN has also set the remainder of its spring training schedule. It's the New 
York Yankees vs. the New York Mets today at 4:30 p.m., Kansas City vs. the 
Houston Astros Thursday at 4:30 p.m., the Dodgers vs. the Atlanta Braves at 
West Palm Beach, Fla., Monday at 10 a.m., Texas vs. the Chicago White Sox on 
April 4 at 4 p.m., and a doubleheader, the Montreal Expos vs. the Minnesota 
Twins (5 p.m.) and the Oakland A's vs. the San Francisco Giants (7:30) on April 
6. 
</P>
<P>
ABC has announced a deal with Don Ohlmeyer Communications and Trans World 
International to televise the Skins Game, the Senior Skins Game and a new 
event, the LPGA Skins Game. NBC previously did the Skins Game and Senior Skins 
Game. The next Skins Game will be on Nov. 24-25 at PGA West in La Quinta; the 
next Senior Skins Game will be on Jan. 26-27, Super Bowl weekend, on Maui, and 
the first LPGA Skins Game will be on May 25-26, 1991, in Frisco, Tex.

CITY SECTION TO CONSIDER ELIMINATION OF TWO-DIVISION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Section competition committee on Monday proposed the elimination of the 
two-division playoff system for the section's 49 high school football teams, 
effective next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, proposed at an Interscholastic Athletics Committee meeting, all 
teams would play in one division, with 16 teams advancing to a postseason 
tournament that would crown one champion. 
</P>
<P>
The IAC is scheduled to vote on the proposal at its next meeting, April 23. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, the City has crowned 4-A Division and 3-A Division football 
champions, but the system has been criticized because of the size of the 
divisions. Currently, 16 teams compete in the 4-A and 12 qualify for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness has called the system a sham, saying it 
merely isolates the schools -- Carson, Banning, Dorsey -- that no one wants to 
play. Nevertheless, he expects some schools to resist the change. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish not to expect an outcry," he said. "But is it a viable, 
legitimate division? Either the divisions have to be of equal size or we should 
do away with the divisions." JOHN LYNCH

SYLMAR DELAYS GAMES IN WAKE OF PLAYER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sylmar High has postponed two baseball games this week following the death of 
senior outfielder Ryan Vela, who died in a car accident last Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar was scheduled to play Monroe on Monday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Pac-8 Conference games have not been rescheduled, but the teams 
could play as soon as Friday, according to Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the sooner we do things and get our mind off it, the better," 
Donatella said. 
</P>
<P>
Donatella met with his players throughout the day Monday, starting with 
sessions in the morning with school psychologists. The Los Angeles Unified 
School District dispatched a support team to counsel players and students who 
grieved Vela's loss. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief team meeting in the afternoon, Donatella canceled practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been pretty tough here," he said. "Everyone in the school is aware of 
what happened. I'm pretty much in the same boat as they are as far as grieving. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in shock Saturday and then met with his parents. That was one of the 
toughest days in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Vela, 17, was killed at 1:45 a.m. Saturday after the car in which he was a 
passenger was struck by a Los Angeles police car, according to police. Teammate 
Pete Amador, 18, suffered a fractured left scapula and Jose Gomez, 18, suffered 
head injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, a 17-year-old Sylmar boy, was arrested on suspicion of 
felony manslaughter and was released to his parents, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Vela had batted .450 and scored seven runs through the team's first eight 
games.

BASEBALL / SPRING TRAINING; 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL COURT IS ASKED TO END UMPIRE BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major league baseball asked a federal court to prevent umpires from boycotting 
any more spring training games, saying it would violate no-strike and grievance 
clauses in their contract. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the request for a temporary restraining order will be held today 
in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibition games started in Florida and Arizona Monday with minor league 
umpires working. 
</P>
<P>
The major league umpires are angry because they were not consulted before the 
regular-season schedule was revised. They are threatening to stay away until 
opening day, April 9. They say they lost money during the lockout and contend 
that the changes will mean fewer days off. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carter made his debut in a San Francisco uniform and doubled home the 
winning run with two outs in the ninth inning to give the Giants a 4-3 victory 
over the Cleveland Indians at Scottsdale, Ariz., in a game televised by ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, signed as a free agent by the Giants, is trying to make a comeback 
after an injury-plagued season with the New York Mets. Last season, he hit .183 
with two home runs and 15 runs batted in. The Mets chose not to re-sign him 
after the season. 
</P>
<P>
When Mitch Webster stepped in to lead off for Cleveland, the umpire told him to 
step out because ESPN needed a few more seconds to get ready. 
</P>
<P>
Webster stood around the plate briefly, and the crowd began shouting. "Get on 
with it!" one fan yelled. "We've waited long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent attended the St. Louis-Pittsburgh exhibition game at 
Bradenton, Fla., and received a loud ovation, despite the lockout that resulted 
in about two-thirds of the exhibition season being canceled. The lockout cost 
Florida millions of dollars in spring-training revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent a lot of time with the fans," Vincent said. "They're very 
forgiving. I was confident baseball could come back. I'm just sorry we're a 
little late." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates won, 5-3, as Barry Bonds and Pirate newcomer Don Slaught homered. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights on the first day of spring training games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Haines City, Fla., rookie Mickey Pina's eighth-inning home run off Mark 
Davis, last year's National League Cy Young award winner, gave the Boston Red 
Sox a 2-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Miami, Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd made his debut with Montreal, pitching 
three scoreless innings in the Expos' 5-3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Tempe, Ariz., Ken Griffey Jr. doubled twice and scored two runs in the 
Seattle Mariners' 7-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Five Mariner 
pitchers, including scheduled opening-night starter Brian Holman, combined on a 
three-hitter. Holman gave up one hit in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Phoenix, the Oakland Athletics trailed the Chicago Cubs, 5-1, going into 
the eighth inning, but rallied for a 6-5 victory on pinch-hitter Steve Howard's 
two-run single with two out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Injury updates: Baltimore's Mickey Tettleton, who underwent surgery on his left 
knee in August and was restricted to being a designated hitter the rest of the 
season, caught five innings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't bother me all," Tettleton said after the game. "If there was going 
to be a problem with it I would have known long before I came to camp." 
</P>
<P>
At Plant City, Fla., Cincinnati left-hander Danny Jackson threw batting 
practice for the first time this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, coming back from shoulder and toe surgery, didn't throw during the 
winter because of his union activities. Manager Lou Piniella says there is a 
chance Jackson will stay behind in Florida when training camp ends. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was 6-11 last season after going 23-8 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
New York Yankee right-hander Pascual Perez, who was expected in camp on Monday, 
didn't make it, but is expected to report today, team officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Three different reasons have been cited for Perez's delay. Yankee General 
Manager Pete Peterson said the team was not upset by the prolonged delay. 
</P>
<P>
Perez had been scheduled to start Monday's exhibition opener against Atlanta 
and is projected as the Yankees' No. 1 starter.

FOR CORONA BEER, SUCCESS STORY COMES FULL CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael J. Mazzoni won't soon forget the days of "Corona-mania," when an 
obscure Mexican brew became a yuppie status symbol, shattering sales records 
and flabbergasting an industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The glass manufacturers couldn't turn out enough bottles," recalled Mazzoni, 
vice president of Barton Beers, the major U.S. importer of Corona Extra. "We 
couldn't get enough rail cars and trucks to get the stuff out of Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Corona-mania came to a crashing finale. Last year, Corona Extra sales plunged 
20%, according to Barton, leading some observers to write it off as the beer 
industry version of the Hula Hoop, an offbeat fancy that had run its inevitable 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a story about how a brand can catch a jet stream -- and fall off," said 
Tom Pirko, a beverage industry consultant in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Some might say it was pushed. Corona's descent actually traces to 1987 when a 
rumor spread -- with the help of unfriendly wholesalers -- that it was 
contaminated. But more than the rumor, Corona's is the tale of how a product 
can prosper in the glow of a particular time and then struggle as times change. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, it remains a top-selling beer import, second only to 
Netherlands-based Heineken. In California and throughout the West, Corona sales 
continue to surpass all its foreign-brewed rivals. And its U.S. importers take 
heart in recent signs that the sales plunge may be starting to end. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of a lot of importers that would be very happy to sell the amount of 
beer that Corona does," said Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's 
Insights, an industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
There is no denying, however, that fortunes have changed drastically for the 
light-tasting brew that became so fashionable in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the issues facing Corona apply to the beer industry overall. Growing 
disapproval of alcohol abuse and drunk driving, for example, has hurt beer 
sales in many bars and restaurants. At the same time, the traditional group of 
beer drinkers -- men age 21 to 35 -- has shrunk as a percentage of the overall 
population, intensifying competition among brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Rising awareness of health and fitness also seems to have limited the amount of 
beer and other alcoholic beverages Americans consume: "The (beer) market has 
been static for the past couple of years," said Paul Gillette, publisher of 
California Beverage Hotline, a trade newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, sales of imported beer actually fell 8% last year, according to 
industry sources, reflecting tough competition from the lower-priced, U.S.-made 
brews. Yet some of the issues affecting Corona are unique to the brand itself. 
</P>
<P>
"There never was a fad like it, a phenomenon like it," said Steinman, who has 
followed events in the beer industry for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the Corona phenomenon, it helps to recall something of America's 
social climate in the early 1980s, a time of rising status consciousness, a 
time when consumer spending was glamorized in the media and fueled by tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit was not yet a headline story, but Americans had started 
to buy more imports than ever -- not just beer, of course, but expensive 
clothes, automobiles, sophisticated electronic equipment. In this environment 
of status-conscious consumption, Corona's long-necked bottle and spray-painted 
label gave it a distinctive look; its import status a certain cachet. 
</P>
<P>
Upscale baby boomers drank it up: "Imported beer allowed people to make a 
statement about themselves," said Mazzoni, adding that "the clear bottle with 
the long neck said to the world, 'Hey, I'm different.' " 
</P>
<P>
Introduced in late 1981, Corona's light taste dovetailed perfectly with a 
growing consumer trend toward light-tasting beer. 
</P>
<P>
The combined effect of these elements was volcanic: Without any television ads, 
Corona sales blazed past such established beer imports as Molson and Labatt's 
of Canada and Beck's of West Germany to capture second place in the category. 
From 1984 to mid-1987, its sales more than quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the upstart Mexican brew seemed to be closing the gap with 
top-ranked Heineken. U.S. wholesalers sold 22.5 million cases of Corona in 
1987, compared to 31 million cases of Heineken, according to Impact, an 
industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
Demand was almost impossible to meet. Mazzoni had to make emergency visits to 
California, where retailers threatened a boycott because they thought he was 
favoring other regions with supplies. Desperate to get out the product, Corona 
employees loaded the beer onto container ships near Mazatlan where it was 
hauled up the West Coast by sea. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, U.S. distributors had to be placed on limited allocations. 
"Logistically, we just couldn't keep up," Mazzoni recalled. 
</P>
<P>
And then Corona-mania was over. In mid-1987, a rumor spread that the beer was 
contaminated with urine. Although the story was unfounded -- and a rival 
wholesaler in Nevada declared so in an out-of-court settlement -- the tale 
apparently took a toll. 
</P>
<P>
Corona's furious growth rate of 170% in 1986 shrank to 67% the following year. 
In 1988, sales at the wholesale level slid 7%. The slide reached 20% last year. 
"Its decline began when the rumor began," said Steinman. "It's an amazing bit 
of American sociology." 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, other problems followed the rumor. Corona's distinctive long-necked 
bottle had not gone unnoticed by major U.S. brewers. By last year, Miller 
Genuine Draft, Miller Lite, Coors, Budweiser and Michelob Dry all had trotted 
out new, long-necked bottles of their own. "It took away the uniqueness of 
Corona," said Mazzoni. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the social climate in which Corona flourished was changing. Simply 
put, the trendy beverage became less trendy. Said Pirko: "It rose like a fad, 
and it fell like a fad." 
</P>
<P>
Corona also was affected by the apparent decline in beer drinking at 
restaurants and bars, where it realizes about 35% of its sales, Mazzoni said. 
</P>
<P>
Although figures are hard to come by, "Anecdotally, all restaurants will tell 
you that their sales of alcohol are down, down, down," said Jeff Prince, senior 
director of the National Restaurant Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The recent problems facing the beer industry have hit imports harder than their 
U.S. rivals, which generally cost less. Domestic beer sales also have been 
aided by the emergence of such aggressively marketed brands as Michelob Dry and 
Miller Genuine Draft, as well as the rise of micro-breweries that churn out 
specialty beers. 
</P>
<P>
Among imports, Heineken, Beck's, Moosehead, St. Pauli Girl and Foster's all had 
sales declines last year, though mostly less severe than Corona's, according to 
estimates by Impact. 
</P>
<P>
Will Corona's slide be reversed? There are few precedents for such a comeback, 
at least among domestic beers, said Robert S. Weinberg, a professor of 
marketing management at Washington University in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are fickle people," Weinberg said of the upscale consumers that 
grabbed for Corona early on. "They found the product amusing for a while and 
now they find some other product amusing." 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all the difficulties, Corona officials say that prospects look bright, 
that a solid core of support will keep the product strong. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Corona once before stunned the beer industry with a success that no 
one could have foreseen. Corona Light, introduced last June, vaulted to third 
place among imported light beers for the year. And slowly, the rumor is fading. 
In February, sales by Corona wholesalers in California, Nevada and Hawaii rose 
9.5% over a year ago, the most significant jump in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we've seen this kind of bounce back since the rumor," said 
Mazzoni. "Things are looking pretty good."

PRICE OF GOLD PLUMMETS $23.10 IN HEAVY SELLOFF; 
</P>

Gold prices plunged Monday as a strong dollar and rumors of heavy selling by 
the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency panicked the market. 
</P>
<P>
Spot gold prices on the New York Commodities Exchange fell $23.10 an ounce 
Monday to close at $365.80 -- the lowest price in six months. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said the selloff may have been spurred by the Saudi 
government, which is rumored to be liquidating 2 million ounces of the metal. 
However, some believe that the Japanese, who have been hard hit by plunging 
stock prices in the past two weeks, and the Soviets, who are attempting to 
bolster their economy, also may have been selling gold. 
</P>
<P>
"There was heavy movement out of gold in the Middle East," said George Anagnos, 
director of market research for the Commodities Exchange. "Rumors about the 
Saudis (liquidating gold) were widespread, but whether they were acting for 
themselves or as a conduit for someone else is not clear." 
</P>
<P>
The gold market, which had staged a brief but glorious rally between October 
and March, was susceptible to a heavy selloff, Anagnos added. The metal's rise 
last year was largely due to inflation fears, a weak dollar and general worries 
about the economy. But those factors have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"On a technical basis, the gold market has been hurt badly," Anagnos said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices tend to rise when the value of the dollar falls, and vice versa. 
And the dollar last week hit a one-year high against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, gold is considered an inflation hedge, so its price generally rises 
when inflation expectations are high. Since the Federal Reserve recently vowed 
to cut inflation by tightening monetary policy, gold was bound to be hit, 
Anagnos said. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff began Monday in Hong Kong, where gold plunged $9.50 to $383.75 an 
ounce. Later, in London, the price plunged $18.45 to $368.50. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks of gold mining companies also were hit. Newmont Gold tumbled $2.875 to 
$46.375; ASA Ltd. dropped $2.50 to $51.625; American Barrick slumped $2 to 
$17.50, and Homestake Mining lost $1.875 to $17.375. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other rare metals fell too. Silver prices dropped 9 cents to $4.95 
an ounce on the New York Comex, and platinum prices for April delivery fell 
$10.20 to $483.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts were not optimistic about a near-term rise in gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will recover very quickly," said Thomas F. Waite, director of 
wholesale marketing at Continental Cos., an investment fund that specializes in 
rare coins and bullion. 
</P>
<P>
Edmond Serfaty, vice president and portfolio manager of US Gold Shares Fund, 
said there could be additional selling pressures over the next few days, 
primarily due to panic. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this has blindsided a lot of people," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Serfaty, who had predicted that gold prices would reach $500 an ounce by 
year-end, said he was revising his estimates downward. 
</P>
<P>
Still, several analysts believe that the metal's prospects are reasonably 
bright over the longer term. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this is something of an aberration," said Dan Stephenson, president of 
Conesco, a broker-dealer affiliated with Continental Cos. "Over the longer 
term, we are still rather bullish."

HOME SALES RISE STATEWIDE BUT FALL SHARPLY IN L.A.

Sales of existing homes in California increased 8.2% in February from the 
previous month to the highest level in 10 months, as buyers decided to jump 
into the market to beat further rises in interest rates, the California Assn. 
of Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sales surge appeared to bypass major portions of Southern 
California. While the Orange County, High Desert and Low Desert areas 
participated in the sales surge, the Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside-San 
Bernardino areas did not, the realtors group reported. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in a separate survey, TRW Real Estate Information Services reported 
Monday that home sales in Southern California fell during February to their 
lowest point since January, 1988. Only 19,558 housing units changed hands last 
month in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino counties 
on a non-seasonally-adjusted basis, 7% lower than January's total and 8% lower 
than a year ago, TRW said. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California housing prices have reached the point where the average 
wage earner simply can't afford to purchase a home," Allan Lubitz, director of 
product development and communications for the TRW unit, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Home sales in the nation as a whole also suffered in February. The number of 
existing single-family homes sold nationwide last month fell 2.3%, to 3.44 
million units on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, down from 3.52 million 
in January, the National Assn. of Realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
The annualized rate represents what would be the total number of homes sold for 
all of 1990 if February's pace is sustained throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the overall surge in California in February was an 
aberration and is not likely to be sustained in part because mortgage rates are 
expected to continue rising. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no softening of interest rates" and this year's sales "will be 
slower than last year's," said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of 
research and economics for the state realtors group. 
</P>
<P>
February's figures were "not a surge, but a normal rhythm of the marketplace," 
said Sanford R. Goodkin, a San Diego real estate consultant. 
</P>
<P>
In California, 560,663 existing, single-family detached homes were sold in 
February on an annualized basis, up 8.2% from an annualized rate of 518,353 in 
January, the state realtors group reported. But the February sales were down 
6.3% from the year-ago month, the realtors group said. 
</P>
<P>
Appleton-Young said most analysts thought the Federal Reserve would ease 
interest rates, "but it was unable to do so because of (rising) interest rates 
in Japan and West Germany." As a result, mortgage rates rose, in response to 
rises in other interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Housing Finance Board said the average rate on fixed-rate mortgages 
of existing homes sold in February rose to 10.30% from 10.13% in January. That 
was the largest monthly increase since May, 1989, when the rate increased 0.25 
percentage points from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing single-family home in California rose to 
$197,184 last month, up 1.1% from $194,952 in January. The median price means 
that half the homes sold for a higher price, while half sold for less. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County region, sales of existing single-family homes rose 11% 
from January's figures on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, but were down 10% 
from a year ago. The median price of a detached home there increased 1.1% to 
$243,285 in February from $240,624 in January. 
</P>
<P>
Appleton-Young said Orange County sellers were "negotiating," and therefore 
some properties were "realistically priced," boosting sales there. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles region, sales dropped 16.8% from January on a non-seasonally 
adjusted basis and were down 23.6% from February, 1989. The median price in the 
region fell 1.7% to $210,123 in February from $213,753 in January. Last month's 
median price, however, was up 6.1% from February, 1989, when the median price 
was $197,991. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the median price was $95,400, down from $96,300 in January and from 
$91,800 a year ago.

PETITION FILED TO DECERTIFY NORDSTROM UNION; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: A UNION LEADER CALLS THE ANNOUNCEMENT AN ATTEMPT BY THE RETAILER TO 
DIVERT ATTENTION FROM LABOR PROBLEMS.

<P>
A petition has been filed to decertify the union representing employees at 
Nordstrom Inc.'s Tacoma store, the retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom said Sunday that it was notified of the filing by the National Labor 
Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
The store has 310 employees represented by Local 367 of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers Union. To hold a decertification election, at least 30% of 
the employees in a bargaining unit must sign the petition. 
</P>
<P>
A union leader said Sunday that the petition was expected and was an attempt by 
Nordstrom to divert attention from its problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's serious," said Joe Peterson, president of UFCW Local 1001. 
Peterson's Seattle local, which represents more than 1,500 Nordstrom workers, 
has led a bitter fight against what it has branded abusive labor practices by 
the upscale department store chain. Last month, the state Department of Labor 
and Industries, acting on a UFCW complaint, ruled Nordstrom had violated state 
laws by failing to pay some employees for attending meetings, delivering 
merchandise, checking inventory, writing thank-you notes to customers, and 
doing other chores outside normal working hours. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the NLRB accused the company of bypassing the union and bargaining 
directly with employees over whether they are owed back wages. Union complaints 
on other issues remain under NLRB review. 
</P>
<P>
The union also filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of wage and 
hour violations. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, 1989, Nordstrom has been seeking changes in contracts with locals 
367 and 1001 in Seattle to allow employees to choose whether to join the union. 
The UFCW only represents employees in the Seattle and Tacoma area, out of 60 
Nordstrom stores and 30,000 employees in six states. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release Sunday, the store said that position "ignited the union's 
expensive, nationally funded smear campaign against Nordstrom." 
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that many of our employees are unhappy with their union and 
feel the UFCW has been inaccurately representing their views," said Joe 
Demarte, Nordstrom's corporate personnel director. "They have been forced to 
take matters into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope an election date will be set promptly, although we fully anticipate 
the union will file a string of unfair labor practice charges to delay and 
block the decertification process." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson had said earlier that the union was preparing more federal labor 
charges after receiving complaints of management pressure to sign statements 
supporting Nordstrom, to participate in rallies for the company and to join the 
decertification campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Nordstrom is attempting to divert attention from its problems by suggesting 
its employees don't support our efforts," Peterson said. "The fact is most 
Nordstrom employees have gone underground in fear of reprisals or of being 
blacklisted."

FORMER PUBLISHER MAKING NEWS WITH FRANCHISE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you want to own a magazine but don't know a thing about publishing? No 
problem. If you have from $150,000 to $200,000 in capital, Barry Rupp has just 
the deal for you. 
</P>
<P>
You won't have too much room to make a distinctive imprint. You'll be obliged 
to call the magazine Business People. You'll have to adhere to a certain layout 
and editorial formula. You'll have to send a good chunk of the cash straight to 
Rupp: $40,000 for the franchise fee and $40,000 to buy a special package of 
desktop publishing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
No one is likely to mistake your magazine for the New Yorker. To begin with, 
you'll have a local publication in a small-city market with an unpaid 
circulation of about 10,000. And the articles will be strictly upbeat, 
"motivational" in character and intended to "build the prosperity of the 
community," Rupp said. 
</P>
<P>
The upside, he said, is a guaranteed profit. "We have a system, and we know 
what works." 
</P>
<P>
He points to the 20 existing magazines in towns such as Fort Wayne, Ind., and 
Worcester, Mass., as evidence that the formula is sound. The magazines, he 
said, provide a unique advertising outlet for local businesses who want to 
reach other businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The jovial Rupp, who is the former chairman of Entrepreneur magazine, didn't 
come up with the Business People concept himself. Rather, he purchased the 
franchise rights for all territories outside of New England from Business 
Digest Inc. of South Portland, Me. But he hopes eventually to have as many as 
500 to 600 franchises, including one covering Costa Mesa, Irvine and Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although many magazines are based on formulas -- and even titles -- that have 
been tested elsewhere, they usually are published under licensing arrangements 
rather than franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a franchise like this," said Jerry Wilkerson, head of a 
company called Franchise Recruiters and former president of the International 
Franchise Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkerson said Business People appears to be a great idea, noting that Rupp 
will assume responsibility for developing the mailing lists and printing the 
magazine in addition to providing a format for the editorial content. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taking the hard part out of it," said Wilkerson, who thought that the 
ideal franchisee would be a local car dealer who was a good salesman and a 
man-about-town. 
</P>
<P>
Rupp said the ideal franchisee would be a "people person" with sales and 
marketing experience and good contacts in the community. Already, he said, he 
has received more than 1,000 inquiries from interested potential franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the few franchises that makes sense for an executive type, a 
guy who's maybe stuck in middle management and wants to get out on his own," 
Rupp said. 
</P>
<P>
Rupp himself is hardly a neophyte in franchising and publishing. He helped 
develop a highly successful Orange County franchiser called Stained Glass 
Overlay, and he and his partners subsequently purchased Entrepreneur magazine 
and moved it from Los Angeles to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
He claims credit for turning around Entrepreneur, but he quit as chairman in 
1988 following a dispute with his partners that was later resolved through a 
lawsuit. As a consequence, Rupp doesn't run advertising in Entrepreneur to 
recruit franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
But Rupp isn't worried about finding interested applicants: "I haven't seen as 
neat a deal as this in a long time. The niche is there, and this system is just 
perfect."

<P>
Business People -- A story in the Business section of The Times on March 27 
incorrectly stated that Business People Magazine Inc. guaranteed profits in its 
franchise program. Barry Rupp, president of the magazine, said the franchise 
system, which is advertised in Entrepreneur magazine, is based on one that has 
worked with more than 20 other community business publications. The story also 
incorrectly identified Jerry Wilkerson, who is former executive vice president 
and director of the International Franchise Assn.

ECONOMICS: A SO-CALLED RED TIDE PARTIALLY DEVASTATED FLORIDA SPONGE BEDS IN THE 
MID-1940S. NOW A BLIGHT OFF THE GREEK ISLES IS HELPING THE U.S. INDUSTRY BOUNCE

TARPON SPRINGS, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the first part of this century, natural sponges were as common in 
American homes as bars of soap or glass bottles of milk. They were used for 
bathing and for general cleaning chores -- and virtually all of them came from 
Tarpon Springs. 
</P>
<P>
But in the mid-1940s, the industry went belly up. A so-called red tide 
devastated Florida's sponge beds, and synthetic sponges were introduced to 
replace the natural ones. 
</P>
<P>
But now, thanks to natural sponges' continuing popularity in Europe and to a 
mysterious blight that destroyed sponges off the Greek Isles starting in early 
1988, the Florida sponge industry has a new lease on life, and this Gulf Coast 
town has become the natural sponge capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Sponging was a major Florida industry for 50 years from the 1890s to the 1940s, 
and Tarpon Springs was at the center of it with a fleet of 200 to 250 sponge 
boats carrying crews totaling 2,500 men. Another 1,000 workers were employed in 
50 sponge-processing plants and warehouses here. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred spongers had migrated to Tarpon Springs from Greece at the turn 
of the century to operate sponge boats and to buy, process and sell the sea 
creatures. Harvesting sponges had been a leading enterprise of Greeks in the 
Mediterranean Sea for 3,000 years, with the sponges being used, among other 
things, as padding for armor. 
</P>
<P>
The sponge beds recovered from the red tide along the Florida coast during the 
1950s and 1960s, but by then Americans were accustomed to less-expensive 
synthetic sponges. A few boats continued to harvest sponges, primarily for the 
painting industry, but there was little demand. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the failure of the sponge beds in the Mediterranean, and European 
sponge merchants descended on Tarpon Springs and other Western Hemisphere 
sponging centers -- Key West, the Bahamas, Cuba, for example -- in 1988 to help 
fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from a two-boat sponge fleet to more than 60 boats summer before 
last," recalled George Billiris, 63, a sixth-generation sponger and owner of a 
sponge-processing firm. "Boats sailed here from California, Louisiana and Texas 
to make a killing on sponges, as prices soared from $5 to $30 a sponge. Local 
fishing and pleasure boats were converted to sponge boats." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Phillips, 49, executive director of the Tarpon Springs Chamber of 
Commerce, said: "What had been a $100,000 annual industry for Tarpon Springs in 
recent years skyrocketed to more than $5 million in 1988." But last year, he 
added, "prices leveled off, the industry stabilized -- with many of the boats 
leaving the area -- and sales amounted to $3 million." 
</P>
<P>
During the height of the sponging season last year from April to November, 20 
boats were involved in the trade here. A similar number is expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
The boats harvest the sponges within a 100-mile range of Tarpon Springs. Divers 
walk the bottom of the sea at 10- to 60-foot depths, with air supplied through 
a hose attached to a compressor on the sponge boat. Using three-foot-long forks 
to pluck the sponges off the floor of the sea, they stay underwater three to 
four hours on each dive. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been shipping 85% of our sponges to Europe since the blight hit the 
Mediterranean," said Michael Giallourakis, 51, president of an 80-year-old 
sponge company founded by his grandfather, a Greek immigrant. "Natural sponges 
have a 10 to 1 sudsing ability over synthetic sponges. That's why Europeans 
prefer them over the cheaper substitutes." 
</P>
<P>
He added that sponges are belatedly enjoying a rebirth of popularity in the 
United States, partly because of environmental concerns. "Sponges are a 
renewable natural resource, 100% biodegradable," he said. "Processing produces 
no pollution." 
</P>
<P>
But Billiris said: "Synthetic sponges are a necessary evil. No way . . . are 
spongers able to produce the numbers made synthetically. And, no way could we 
ever compete price-wise. But this big spurt due to the Mediterranean blight is 
a delight for the few of us in what is now considered an exotic business."

The family of the late An Wang says it will keep its "ownership position" in 
Wang Laboratories Inc. and support President Richard Miller's plan to 
revitalize the troubled computer company. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick A. Wang, the son of the company founder who died Saturday of 
esophageal cancer, said Sunday that family members believe "that the long-term 
plan now being implemented to return the company to profitability will achieve 
its objectives and that implementation of the plan remains the best means 
through which to maximize stockholders' value in the company. 
</P>
<P>
"We support Rick Miller and the other members of the Wang management team in 
their efforts to build a strong and growing company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Wang was replaced by Miller last fall after resigning as company 
president in a management shake-up ordered by his father. Frederick Wang 
remains a company director. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1989, despite the elimination of 8,000 jobs worldwide, Wang 
Laboratories posted a six-month loss of $72 million. 
</P>
<P>
The family holds roughly two-thirds of the voting shares in the company, which 
has annual revenue of about $3 billion, said Wang spokesman Paul Guzzi. 
</P>
<P>
A regularly scheduled meeting of the company's board is to be held Wednesday in 
Lowell, where the company is based, Guzzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Guzzi declined to say whether Frederick Wang would be named chairman and chief 
executive but said "the whole issue of successorship to Dr. Wang will be 
resolved and clarified Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a memorial service was scheduled for this afternoon for An Wang at 
the Memorial Church on the Harvard campus. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with $600 in working capital and a loft in Boston's South End, Wang 
built a company that pioneered desktop electronic calculators, word processing, 
mini-computers and image processing. 
</P>
<P>
Among his legacies is the Wang Center for Performing Arts, a key component of 
efforts to revitalize Boston's theater district.

GILLETTE CUTS OFF PURCHASE OF WILKINSON'S U.S. UNIT

Gillette Co. said Monday that it would not go through with its previously 
announced purchase of the U.S. operations of rival Wilkinson Sword Inc., bowing 
to government concerns that the acquisition would undercut competition in the 
razor blade business. However, Gillette said it would still go through with its 
planned acquisition of a non-voting interest in Wilkinson's large European 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In settling an antitrust suit filed by the government, Gillette, which has half 
of the U.S. razor and razor blade market, agreed not to buy Wilkinson's U.S. 
business. Gillette said it decided to settle the case to avoid the time and 
expense of a lengthy trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice filed suit in January against Boston-based Gillette, 
alleging that the purchase "would eliminate one of only four other suppliers of 
blades and further increase Gillette's dominant share." 
</P>
<P>
In December, Gillette said it planned to invest $155 million in a deal that 
would give it a substantial stake in Wilkinson, which holds 3% of the U.S. 
razor market. The overall deal was previously valued at $600 million.

PUBLISHER SCORES WITH DESIGNER BASEBALL CARDS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLECTIBLES: AN ORANGE COUNTY FIRM HAS HIT A HOMER WITH ITS LINE OF 
HIGH-QUALITY, FULL-COLOR CARDS AIMED AT THE UPSCALE MARKET.

<P>
The national pastime's lockout nearly threw the baseball card business a curve, 
but Upper Deck, the hottest commodity in that booming market, already was safe 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball card sales are typically slowest just before spring training opens. 
With the delay caused by the player lockout, some expected the retail card 
market to suffer a prolonged sag. 
</P>
<P>
However, Upper Deck, the Yorba Linda-based manufacturer of slick -- and 
expensive -- trading cards, already had sold out its 1990 inventory even as 
negotiations between league teams and players dragged on for 32 days. 
</P>
<P>
From its inception, Upper Deck has overcome economic obstacles en route to 
quick success in a highly competitive field. 
</P>
<P>
The firm burst on the market a year ago, facing an uphill struggle competing 
with the entrenched card company giants, Topps, Fleer and Donruss. But Upper 
Deck introduced several innovations, including color photos on front and back, 
and quickly captured the high-end market with its designer cards. 
</P>
<P>
A full set of Upper Deck cards, if you can get them, commands $55 compared to 
from $22 to $25 for its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball lockout may eventually hurt retail card sales, Upper Deck 
President Richard McWilliam said. But Upper Deck already had orders from 
dealers that assured a sellout of its entire year's production before a pitch 
was thrown, company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"No other company sells out," said the 36-year-old McWilliam of Corona del Mar, 
who played high school and college baseball and has a background in accounting 
and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliam was approached in late 1987 by Paul Sumner, who had "a little dream . 
. . to make Architect's (sic) Digest-quality baseball cards." 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old Sumner, a Chino resident and at the time vice president of 
sales at Orbis Graphic in Anaheim, had a background in printing and holography. 
</P>
<P>
With a third partner, Sumner's boss, Boris Korbel, they set out to produce a 
prototype card impressive enough to persuade Major League Baseball and the 
players' association to grant the fledgling firm a license to produce cards 
bearing team logos and player photos. Joined by a fourth partner, Richard Kughn 
of Detroit, Mich., Upper Deck has grown from a small office with six employees 
to its own printing company employing 250. 
</P>
<P>
But breaking into the big leagues was not easy. When Upper Deck cards were 
shipped to retailers for the first time in March, 1989, the competition already 
had been on store shelves for three months. 
</P>
<P>
By introducing several new features -- color photos front and back, a hologram 
scheme to prevent counterfeiting and high-grade paper stock -- Upper Deck 
immediately drew rave reviews and unprecedented demand. It virtually created a 
high-end market. 
</P>
<P>
A Topps 16-card pack retails for about 50 cents at most outlets, but the 
suggested 99-cent Upper Deck 15-card pack routinely is sold for $1.50 and more. 
At times last year, they were going for as much as $3. 
</P>
<P>
"It really did take off right from the start," said Bob Lemke, publisher of 
Krause Publications' Baseball Cards, a 310,000-circulation magazine that lists 
card prices in the resale market. "They are just far and away superior in terms 
of value." 
</P>
<P>
Although precise production figures are not released, Topps, which is in its 
40th year of baseball card production, claims to have sold 1 billion cards last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Upper Deck says it purposely limited its initial 1989 production to 1 million 
sets of each card, which drove up demand. (Subsequently, Upper Deck printed 
more cards that were sold in complete sets, rather than in packs of 15 cards 
each. The company has declined to reveal how many sets were produced.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really looking to manufacture Upper Deck cards to meet demand," said 
Donald M. Bodow, the company's marketing vice president. "We don't want our 
cards to be generally perceived as being as easily available as a glass of 
water. They are being perceived as true collectables." 
</P>
<P>
The privately owned Upper Deck does not release its sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia-based Topps Co. Inc., the industry leader, recorded $198 million 
in sales in the year ending Feb. 25, 1989, more than half of which was from 
baseball cards. The company, which also produces candy and gum products and 
non-sports trading cards, is ahead of that record pace this year. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball card market continues to grow each year, leaving plenty of room 
for newcomers such as Upper Deck, industry officials agree. Estimates of card 
and memorabilia sales range from $400 million to $600 million a year, Lemke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Upper Deck's McWilliam declined to say how much in royalties his firm 
pays Major League Baseball or the players' association, Krause Publication's 
Lemke estimates the fees to be about 8% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to baseball cards, the older, more scarce issues of popular 
players often resell for enormous sums. But the price of most new individual 
cards range from pennies to a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1990 Upper Deck card of rookie Baltimore Oriole pitcher Ben McDonald is 
selling for $100 because the "rookie" designation was inadvertently left off in 
printing. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Rosen of New Jersey, believed to be among the world's leading dealers in 
baseball cards, usually has little interest in current cards, prefering 
costlier, older items. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, Rosen "will be dabbling for the first time in newer cards, in 
the Upper Deck cards," said Greg Sholes, who works for Rosen's Mr. Mint 
memorabilia business. "He feels it's a strong enough product." 
</P>
<P>
Sholes, who also buys and sells cards as an investment, was impressed by Upper 
Deck's entrance in the baseball card market. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally have seen nothing like it in the hobby," he said. "The demand was 
unbelievable by dealers. I'd say (Upper Deck is) a cut above."

REALITY SETS IN: LIFE IN THE ECONOMIC FAST LANE MAY BE OVER 
</P>

<P>
Earlier this year, John P. LaWare visited his old stamping grounds in Boston, 
where economic gloom is thicker than a March fog on Boston Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
LaWare, who left his job as chairman of Shawmut Bank two years ago to become a 
member of the Federal Reserve Board, gently chided some of his friends for 
having lost their perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I know most of you have had the sometimes hair-raising experience of driving 
on the Mass Pike," he said in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce. "Although 
the posted speed limit is 55, most of the traffic whirs along at 65 to 70. 
After you have been traveling with the crowd, well over the limit, if you have 
to slow down to 55, you have the feeling you are just crawling along. Travel in 
the fast lane is exhilarating, and when you have to slow down there is a sense 
of disappointment and frustration." 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts and other parts of the Northeast there is plenty of 
disappointment and frustration with a regional economy that clearly is lagging 
after years in which, as LaWare put it, "we were on a roll, and it didn't look 
like it would ever stop." 
</P>
<P>
That same sense of moving out of the fast lane is hardly confined to the 
Northeast. It has hit Washington and some other metropolitan areas, and in a 
way, the United States as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Booms have not turned to busts, either locally or nationally. Even in 
Massachusetts the unemployment rate has only risen to match the national 
average of 5.3%. Rather, what has happened is that some key ingredients for 
rapid growth, especially unemployed labor, have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, after six years of expansion during which unemployment was cut in 
half, economic growth has slowed enough that the jobless rate has been 
virtually unchanged for nearly a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Like it or not, such a slowdown was inevitable at some point. Just like 
highways, economies have speed limits, and they cannot readily be changed by 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
As the president's Council of Economic Advisers put it in its annual report 
last month, "The nation's productive capacity depends on the level of 
technology, the supply and quality of capital, and the number and skills of 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
After recessions, stepped-up use of readily available labor and capital -- 
unemployed workers and shuttered factories -- translates quickly into growth in 
the output of goods and services. "As in most economic expansions, much of the 
relatively rapid growth since the recovery began in 1982 can be attributed to 
increases in the employment and utilization of existing resources." the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the country, the extended expansion created a sense that such 
fast growth was "normal" and raised expectations to unrealistic levels. With 
relatively few idle workers, factories or machines in the United States today, 
the CEA cautioned that "fewer opportunities to increase utilization of 
available resources remain." 
</P>
<P>
CEA Chairman Michael J. Boskin and his two colleagues project in their report 
that productivity gains -- increases in the goods and services produced during 
each hour worked -- will become a more important source of economic growth than 
increases in the size of the labor force during the 1990s. That would be a 
reversal from the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Bush CEA is somewhat less cautious about the risk of higher 
inflation than a number of other economists and policy-makers, including most 
of those at the Federal Reserve, the report's long-term economic projections 
indicate that the council does not think that the unemployment rate should be 
pushed below 5%. Doing so could spur faster growth in wages and benefits, which 
would lead to higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
If faster growth added to the demand for labor only in states such as Michigan, 
Louisiana and West Virginia, all of which have unemployment rates of 7% or 
more, perhaps the national rate could be lowered without putting added pressure 
on wages in those areas in which unemployment was average or below. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, market forces work in that direction as employers seeking to 
expand or reduce costs shift operations to areas in which labor is more 
plentiful. But there is little that any government policy can do to encourage 
job creation in a particular spot -- except by making choices for where it 
spends its own money, such as for military bases or the planned $8-billion 
superconducting supercollider slated for Texas. Certainly the Federal Reserve 
does not know how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing recently, Rep. Olympia Snowe, D-Maine, sought some words of 
reassurance from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan about the problems in her state 
and region. "Do you look at the regions in determining our monetary policy, or 
do you think it's just unique to that particularly region?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Replied Greenspan, "Unfortunately, our monetary policy can only be national 
because we are dealing with a national interest rate, a national currency and 
basically national prices." 
</P>
<P>
Snowe described the results of the shock from dashed expectations. In Maine, 
she said, "people are retrenching in terms of their spending. I mean they just 
lack the confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they have a job and the unemployment rate hasn't increased 
significantly to indicate that there is something seriously wrong in that area, 
people are nevertheless hesitant about spending because of the decline in the 
value of real estate and whatever else has happened." 
</P>
<P>
This confrontation with reality became inescapable when the Northeast 
effectively ran out of available labor. In coming years, economists studying 
regional patterns believe, above-average growth will come in states in the 
South and West, where labor will be available because of relatively high 
population gains. 
</P>
<P>
When labor markets get tighter than average, wages tend to rise faster than 
average. At least that has been true in the Northeast, according to the Labor 
Department's employment cost index. 
</P>
<P>
More detailed estimates for individual metropolitan areas by regional 
economists at Data Resources Inc. showed that the seven cities with the largest 
increases were all in the Northeast. Figures for the seven ranged from 8% in 
Newark to 9.2% in Bridgeport, Conn., compared with a national average of 5.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did this just begin last year. With labor markets so tight, compensation 
has been rising more rapidly in the Northeast than nationally for some time, 
and that is one of the major reasons economic growth has slowed sharply. 
</P>
<P>
If companies know the only way to find workers is to raise pay high enough to 
take them away from other employers, they think twice about expanding. 
</P>
<P>
But the impact of tight labor markets and rapid wage increases doesn't stop 
there. With more money to spend, buyers have been able to bid up the price of 
goods and services not set in national markets, especially the price of 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The natural reaction of developers and lenders was to flood these booming 
markets with expensive new single-family homes, condominiums and vacation 
houses. A large amount of new commercial office space was built, too. 
</P>
<P>
As fast as incomes were rising, however, they were not doubling in three years, 
as house prices did in some areas. At some point, home prices had to stop 
rising so fast, and they finally did so abruptly last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now thousands of new condominiums stand unsold, some developers are out of 
business and several major lenders -- most prominently the Bank of New England, 
which lost $1.11 billion in 1989 -- have a lot of nonperforming loans on their 
books. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of all the unsold homes and unoccupied offices, new construction, a 
major source of growth, has been slashed drastically and is now a drag on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Other such cyclical forces are at work in the American economy, too. 
Manufacturing firms have spent considerable money modernizing their plants in 
the past couple of years. In industries such as paper and chemicals that ran 
short of production capacity at the end of 1988, part of the capital spending 
has increased capacity as well as efficiency. Now most forecasters expect 
smaller increases in investment. 
</P>
<P>
Even the dollar is doing its part, rising in value compared with several key 
foreign currencies and making U.S. goods more expensive in other countries. 
This leads economists to expect smaller increases in exports this year -- 
another development that will tend to hold down economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
But the key question not just for 1990 but the rest of the decade is what 
resources the nation will have available to put into the growth pot. For 
example, every American who will enter the labor force during the 1990s has 
already been born. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of immigrants will swell that total but not change the 
essential picture, which is one of slower labor force growth than during the 
1970s or 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The CEA noted in its report that "many observers now worry about the 
availability of workers -- especially skilled workers. Some have even argued 
that labor shortages will dominate the 1990s and may slow economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
Boskin and his colleagues nevertheless are optimistic that market forces will 
mitigate some of the impact from slower growth of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who argue that labor shortages will stall the economy in the next decade 
ignore the flexibility and adaptability of U.S. firms, workers and 
governments," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Stalling the economy is not necessarily the issue, however. The U.S. labor 
force is likely to grow only about 1.3% a year in the first half of this decade 
and production of goods and services by those added workers will raise national 
output. 
</P>
<P>
But increases in the work force averaging 1.3% will be lower than the 1.7% rate 
of most of the 1980s and lower still than the 2.4% annual increase between 1973 
and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The civilian labor force stood at 124.4 million at the beginning of this year. 
Therefore, a 1.3% annual increase would mean about 1.6 million more workers a 
year. Providing employment for those additional workers would require roughly 
135,000 new jobs per month. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures are not understood in some quarters. For example, when the 
monthly figures on payroll employment hit the news, financial market analysts 
routinely describe anything less than a gain of 175,000 to 200,000 as evidence 
of significant economic weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Like all those residents of the Northeast with unreasonable expectations about 
what is "normal" growth, some analysts seem to have an exaggerated sense of how 
fast the labor force and thus the overall economy is likely to grow. 
</P>
<P>
A few, such as Richard Rahn, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
understand the numbers but believe the economy still has plenty of room to 
expand because they think the unemployment rate could fall to 4% and perhaps to 
3% without causing inflation to worsen. 
</P>
<P>
Rahn argues that if the Federal Reserve pursued a steady, predictable policy of 
money growth and the unemployment rate fell slowly over a period of years, 
inflation problems would be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
But that is a minority opinion. "When you've used up your unused resources to a 
degree that you see inflation creeping up, as I think was the case in 1988 and 
1989, you have to shift the burden of risk and be more concerned about 
inflation," declared Marvin Kosters of the American Enterprise Institute in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news today is continuing growth but moderate growth. It would not be 
good news to see growth rates shoot up. Then policy would have to turn more 
restrictive," probably pushing the economy into a recession, Kosters said. 
</P>
<P>
Kosters' view is widely held, and certainly is the basis of the Fed policy that 
shifted in the spring of 1988 to seeking to slow economic growth to head off a 
surge in inflation.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CRESCOTT SELLS SOME SHARES IN DATAPRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crescott Partners, a New York investor group that abandoned a takeover bid for 
Dataproducts Corp. in January, cut its stake in the Woodland Hills 
computer-printer maker. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Crescott said it sold 
411,911 common shares of Dataproducts between Jan. 24 and March 15 at prices 
between $5.87 and $10 a share. The group now owns 1.1 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The sale included 334,772 shares sold back to Dataproducts for $10 a share 
under the company's self-tender offer, in which Dataproducts repurchased about 
20% of its stock as part of a restructuring plan.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: EXCESSIVE-TRADING CASE SETTLED, BROKER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former co-worker of two San Fernando Valley stockbrokers who allegedly 
churned the investments of several Southern California cities said he settled 
federal allegations that he failed to adequately supervise the brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Gary W. Chambers, 47, of Little Rock, Ark., said he reached the settlement with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which made the allegations against him 
in an administrative proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the settlement had not yet been formalized by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers claimed that others were responsible for supervising the traders. The 
brokers, William E. Parodi Sr. of Woodland Hills and his brother, Frederick W. 
Parodi of Canoga Park, worked with Chambers at the now-defunct First Investment 
Securities, a Little Rock-based firm that had a branch office in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC alleged that in 1986-87, the brokers generated commissions of at least 
$1.4 million by excessively trading investments they made for cities such as 
Lawndale, San Marino and Palmdale, and local government agencies. Their trading 
also resulted in losses of more than $958,000, the SEC alleged. 
</P>
<P>
In a settlement last October, the Parodi brothers agreed to leave the 
securities business for life but did not admit to breaking federal securities 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers said that under his settlement, he neither admitted nor denied the 
allegations but agreed not to take a job supervising traders for six months. He 
said he can otherwise work in the securities business and that he currently is 
a consultant.

YOUR BODY: STOCK UP ON TIPS FOR ALLERGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not everyone's fancy turns exclusively to romance when spring arrives. One in 
six Southern Californians again is sniffling through allergy season, stocking 
up on facial tissue and scouting drugstores for economy-size decongestants. 
</P>
<P>
This year's season is in full swing, fueled by the recent hot spell and the 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to last year, this year's allergy season is about a month late," said 
Dr. Robert Eitches, an allergist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and an 
assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at the UCLA School of Medicine. "And 
it will probably be moderate in severity." 
</P>
<P>
Trees now are the main source of problem pollens. "Pollen counts from trees are 
up considerably over two weeks ago," said Eleanor Newhouse, a spokeswoman for 
the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, Los Angeles chapter, which 
records pollen levels. 
</P>
<P>
High pollen counts, she said, have been recorded for walnut, olive, pine, 
sycamore, ash, oak, acacia, juniper, cedar and eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
Pollens from grasses, weeds and mold spores also can contribute to the misery. 
</P>
<P>
But predictions and pollen counts provide little comfort for the allergic. And 
misconceptions about how to self-treat can make symptoms worse, allergists say. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most common mistakes allergists encounter from patients: 
</P>
<P>
* Use of over-the-counter nasal decongestants. "It's a quick fix," Eitches 
said, "but in a day or two you can get a rebound effect. The medication, at 
first, shrinks the swollen blood vessels that cause the congestion and you 
immediately feel better. Then, the medication wears off and the swelling 
returns, sometimes worse than before you took the medicine." Eitches tells 
patients to use saline-only nasal sprays for relief. Long-term use of oral 
decongestants is OK, he added, in the absence of high blood pressure or heart 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Relying on fresh air to relieve symptoms. Many patients "think that fresh air 
will make them feel better," Eitches said. "But they will only breathe in more 
pollens." Forget about exercising outdoors if the pollen count is high, he 
advises. And avoid lawn blowers, which scatter pollen widely. 
</P>
<P>
Other routes to relief: 
</P>
<P>
* Stay indoors if possible. "Especially in the morning," Eitches said. "Pollen 
levels are usually highest from 5 a.m. until 10 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
* Schedule vacations during allergy season. "Take vacation near the water if 
you're allergic," Eitches said. "Or travel to sites above 5,000 feet," 
suggested Dr. Lewis Kanter , a Camarillo allergist. "Higher elevations have 
lower pollen counts." 
</P>
<P>
* Close the windows at home and in your car. Use air filtering machines at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
* Take prescribed or recommended medications before exposure. "Take that pill 
before you cut the grass," Eitches tells his patients allergic to grass 
pollens. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid allergens when possible. "If you can't," Kanter said, "wash your hands 
thoroughly as soon as possible."

POINT COUNTERPOINT

Lasers Beam In as New Solution in Dentistry 
</P>
<P>
Developers of a dental laser, not yet approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration, hope to alter the traditional patient-dentist dialogue. Delete: 
"Oh, no, not the drill." Insert: "Beam me up, Doc." 
</P>
<P>
Under development by a Michigan company, the laser emits energy in short bursts 
or pulses, giving dentists more control. Proponents say the laser, which has 
been tested on more than 10,000 patients, will be useful to vaporize decay, to 
scale calculus from teeth roots, to make root canal procedures easier and to 
desensitize crown preparations. How big a role will the dental laser play, and 
how quickly? Here are the opinions of two experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Marwan Abou-Rass, professor and chairman, department of endodontics, USC 
School of Dentistry: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a dental laser will be in every dental office for many years. 
Initially, it will be used mainly by specialists such as endodontists, 
periodontists and oral surgeons to treat those teeth which now are doomed to 
extraction or loss by present means. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a great supporter of the laser. But it won't replace the dental drill. One 
limiting factor is cost. Those that are safe now cost about $40,000 or 
$50,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel White, assistant professor of restorative dentistry, UC San Francisco 
School of Dentistry: 
</P>
<P>
"For patients afraid of needles, knives or drills, the laser offers an 
alternative treatment. For bombed-out teeth, this laser won't replace the drill 
or root canal. But it can be used to treat early stages of decay conservatively 
for which the drill would be more destructive. It can be used instead of a 
knife or a scalpel to remove gum tissue before building restorations such as 
crowns. 
</P>
<P>
"In our clinical study comparing laser with a conventional scalpel to remove 
gum tissue, the laser procedure removed gum tissue successfully without 
anesthesia and resulted in less bleeding." 
</P>

<P>
A Microwave Path to Relieving Pain 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by aching muscles after one tennis set too many? Arthritis pain? Relief 
is as close as the microwave, claims a Texas company marketing "Moist Hot 
Wraps." The terry cloth wraps, mainly for use around the wrist or ankle, are 
filled with a gel, said a spokeswoman for Spenco Medical Corp. of Waco, Tex. 
After 60 seconds in the microwave, the gel inside is warm enough to deliver up 
to 30 minutes of moist heat therapy. The wraps, sold in drugstores and sporting 
good stores, cost from $12 to $20, depending on size. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have the money, it's definitely worth a try," said Dr. Stephen Kay , an 
orthopedic surgeon and arthritis specialist who co-directs the Joint 
Replacement Center at Century City Hospital. "It's a quick delivery system for 
moist heat. Moist heat is better than dry (for pain relief) because it 
penetrates deeper." 
</P>
<P>
The microwave moist heat wrap is no better than traditional moist heat systems, 
such as those that must be boiled, Kaye added. "But it is more convenient."

ART BUCHWALD: REAGAN'S SCRIPT HAS SOME HOLES IN IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ART BUCHWALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It used to be that this nation's heroes said things like, "I only regret that I 
have but one life to lose for my country," or "We have just begun to fight," or 
"Give me liberty or give me death," or "Remember the Maine." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays all our heroes can come up with is, "I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
Here, purportedly, are the video outtakes of the recent deposition of Ronald 
Reagan, which were given for the Adm. Poindexter trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, could you please tell us exactly what you knew and when you 
knew it with regard to the Iran-Contra affair?" 
</P>
<P>
"I . . . I . . . I don't remember knowing anything about the Iran-Contra thing. 
This is the first I've heard of it." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let me try your memory on something else. Do you recall working for 
Warner Brothers as an actor before you went into politics?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course. I came from Radio Station WHO in Des Moines, where I was a 
sportscaster, and I covered the Northwestern football games. Northwestern beat 
Michigan 24 to 12 when Myron Hoffsteder fumbled on the 3-yard line. After that, 
I went to Southern California with the Chicago Cubs for spring training and did 
a screen test for Bill Meiklejohn at Warner Brothers. Luckily, I was hired 
because the cab fare came to $10.33." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, Mr. President, can we get back to the illegal sale of arms to Iran and the 
laundering of money for the Nicaraguan rebels?" 
</P>
<P>
"That was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about that. A President 
can't remember everything he did." 
</P>
<P>
"But you do recall 'Knute Rockne -- All-American.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It was my favorite movie. I remember going to the commissary one day with Pat 
O'Brien. It was 1:20 p.m. and Pat had a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich on 
toasted rye and a glass of buttermilk, and I had a cream cheese and smoked 
salmon on pumpernickel, with a bag of potato chips and iced tea. We sat at this 
back table against the wall that had a picture of Bette Davis and Humphrey 
Bogart. She was in a domino print dress and he wore a striped suit with no tie. 
Pat said to me, 'Don't you love the movie business?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, did you know that Lt. Col. North was going to lie to Congress?" 
</P>
<P>
"How could I know that when I didn't know anything. North, South, East, West -- 
when you've seen one National Security aide you've seen them all." 
</P>
<P>
"Then you maintain that you don't know who Col. North was?" 
</P>
<P>
"I can't recall the gentleman -- I tried not to remember names when I was in 
the White House." 
</P>
<P>
"Can you remember 'Bedtime for Bonzo?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Who can forget 'Bedtime for Bonzo?' I didn't like the chimp very much because 
he used to bite me on the knuckles, and he tried to steal the picture from me. 
He smelled a lot and only ate green bananas, which, in those days, cost 8 cents 
each. I used to buy them for him at the Fairfax Farmers Market -- bananas were 
always in Row D, Aisle 6." 
</P>
<P>
"You seem to have a good memory, Mr. President, except for the Iran-Contra 
affair." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm wracking my brain to help you, but it's all a blank. I'm sure Iran had 
something to do with something, but I don't know what." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you lost your memory when you were informed that you had violated the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
"Right. That's why I'm calling my new book: 'Where Is the Rest of Me?' "

THINK OVER SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I mentioned to my family doctor that I was thinking of having some 
cosmetic surgery done, and he said I should think about it for a while first. 
If I can afford the operation and I want to look better than I now do, what is 
there to think about? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Any plastic surgeon you may eventually see will probably offer similar 
advice. The success or failure of a cosmetic procedure often depends upon the 
patient's expectations. No matter how successful the operation from an 
objective point of view, it will be unsuccessful from the patient's standpoint 
if more was expected. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a person who undergoes a face-lift operation has the right to 
expect to look more youthful; that's the purpose of the procedure. But a 
50-year-old woman will not look the same as she did when she was 30. Moreover, 
there are factors outside the surgeon's control that can affect the results. 
Poor health and cigarette smoking, for example, may make for a poor outcome 
regardless of the surgeon's skill. 
</P>

INTO THE NIGHT: PARTY HAS AN OSCAR STATE OF MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: A pre-Oscar party Sunday night at L'Orangerie restaurant; its sole 
intent was to provide Hollywood executives, actors, insiders, columnists, and, 
yes, nominees one more opportunity to prognosticate and pontificate on Monday 
night's outcome. No speeches. No honoree. Harry Winston jewelers and Relais 
&amp; Chateaux, the international restaurant and hotel directory, just wanted 
to throw a party. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Oscar shoptalk. Shoe-ins. Party overload. The ongoing enigma of How 
Academy Members Think. Companies that close early on Oscar Monday so people can 
go home and watch the arrivals on television. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "I voted for you." 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: By nominee Ron Kovic (adapted screenplay, "Born on the Fourth of 
July"), "My mother and father are driving all the way from Yuma, Ariz., in 
their motor home. At the last minute they decided they wanted to come." 
</P>
<P>
Noted: By nominee Martin Landau (supporting actor, "Crimes and Misdemeanors"), 
who recently returned from the Berlin Film Festival, on the response to his 
film there, "East Berliners loved it. The laughs came when they were supposed 
to -- no difference from a New York audience." 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Nominee Oliver Stone (director, adapted screenplay, "Born on the 
Fourth of July"), Army and Selma Archerd, Maurice Jarre, Maximilian Schell and 
Natalya Andrechenko Siberiade, Michael Caine, Roger Moore, Irving and Mary 
Lazar, Jose Eber, Jackie Collins, Marvin and Barbara Davis with daughter Patty 
Raynes, Jack Valenti, Robert Wagner and Jill St. John, Jaclyn Smith, Leonard 
and Wendy Goldberg, Freddie Fields, Al and Wanda Ruddy, Robert and Rosemarie 
Stack, and L'Orangerie owners Gerard and Virginie Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Tuxedos for the men (the sole exceptions were Kovic, in sports 
jacket, and Stone, who wore white athletic shoes with a dark suit); materials 
that twinkled for the women including the dazzling diamonds worn by the Harry 
Winston contingent. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Smoked sturgeon and salmon with chanterelles and basil, lamb loin with 
ginger and mint, pear tart with candied ice cream and petit fours, all washed 
down with Dom Perignon. 
</P>
<P>
Planning ahead: The indefatigably sociable Jayne and Henry Berger will stay 
home in their robes and watch the Oscars on TV -- starting off with caviar, 
followed by hot dogs, hamburgers and chili, all prepared by their French chef.

BLACK HUMOR WITH A HEART IN MAURICE NOEL'S 'CANAAN LAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The voice of playwright Maurice Noel is original. His writing is quirky, 
surprising and deeply human. 
</P>
<P>
In "Canaan Land," a trio of one-acts that marks his Los Angeles debut, at the 
Cast-at-the-Circle Theatre, he finds the humor and heartbreak of people lost in 
the dark labyrinth of life. He's also found a director, Joe Mays, who knows the 
shape of Noel's work and a company able to give it a startling patina. 
</P>
<P>
"Scarlet Sister Mary" concerns a woman who has deserted her husband and child 
back home and found contentment of a sort in Manhattan, begging coins in nun's 
habit. Roseland is her cathedral, and she met God at Radio City Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Iona Straker" changed her name to Pagan Fury when she became a stripper. Now, 
she's long in the tooth and grinding it out in a cheap carnival -- the 
customers holler "Put it back on!" But she finds her troubles pale next to 
those of Bonnie Lou, whose snake has just died. 
</P>
<P>
The gnawing illness of religious fanaticism supersedes any "Memorial" to a 
deceased mother when her grown children find themselves trapped forever in the 
lunatic web of their overpowering Aunt Opal. 
</P>
<P>
Uncomfortable subjects? Not in Noel's view. He finds them hilariously funny, at 
least until he twists his scalpel in the final moment of each play. He proves 
that laughing at ourselves, even in the direst circumstance, is still the best 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Mays has cast the three plays with one eye on the text and the other on the 
actors' ability to jump imperceptibly from comedy to pathos without skipping a 
beat. Lucy Lee Flippin gives style and richness to both the scarlet nun and 
"Memorial's" evil aunt, and Susan Kellerman is her equal as the nun's trashy 
mother and tattered trouper Pagan Fury. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Irwin scores doubly as the nun's unloving, unthinking husband and Aunt 
Opal's muddled nephew Simon, who used to get spiritual messages from water in 
the bathroom and is the channel for his mother's restless spirit. Tony Campisi 
is good as the snake lady's husband. His wife is captured incisively by 
Elizabeth Cava, who also brings originality to Simon's wheelchair-bound sister, 
who has spiritual difficulties of her own. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Daley deserves a mention for his tongue-in-cheek credit for the "black 
walls" against which Noel's black comedies unfold. Maurice Noel is a name to 
remember. His images are fresh and an affectionate heart is at the core of his 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 800 N. El Centro Ave., Hollywood; Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m.; ends 
April 18. $10; (213) 462-0265.

GUITARIST GREGORY ON RIGHT COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the Los Angeles Jazz Society's annual tributes is a Shelly Manne 
Memorial Award given to a new talent. The most recent winner, guitarist Steve 
Gregory, was heard Sunday at the Society's weekly "Windows on Hollywood" brunch 
in the Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory, 26, is still a student at Cal State Northridge; his bassist, Trey 
Henry, and drummer David Tull, are CSN graduates. Because all three have often 
worked together in several contexts, what was heard Sunday rose at times above 
the conventional jam session level. 
</P>
<P>
True, some of the numbers were predictable, but Gregory's workouts on "Autumn 
Leaves" and "No Greater Love" displayed his assertively fluent style on a solid 
body guitar, alternating between long single note lines and occasional bursts 
of well-timed chords. 
</P>
<P>
Of special interest was his version of Monk's "Straight No Chaser," for which 
he rearranged the length of the tune's already quirky phrases so that they 
became doubly eccentric. The trio's repertoire also boast a few original works. 
"Jazz Brunch," composed for this occasion by Gregory, opened stealthily with a 
vamp spelled by a series of drum breaks before stating its well-crafted theme. 
"Extrovert," by bassist Henry, was a buoyant showpiece for the unit. 
</P>
<P>
New music aside, what's laudable about musicians like Gregory, Henry and Tull 
is that they know such songs as "My One and Only Love" and "Yardbird Suite," 
and can play them in 1990 without seeming either antiquated or condescending. 
Gregory's technical finesse and imagination have set him on the right course, 
one that will surely establish his firmly in the new non-synthesized generation 
of true believers.

'MUSIC FOR MISCHA' PROGRAM AT SCHOENBERG HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late Beethoven requires a great deal from its listeners, even more from its 
performers. A daunting challenge, then, this latest "Music for Mischa" program 
at Schoenberg Hall, UCLA: two of Beethoven's last string quartets, his Opus 132 
in A minor and Opus 131 in C-sharp minor. 
</P>
<P>
The players in Sunday's installment of the series -- honoring the late Mischa 
Schneider, cellist of the Budapest Quartet -- are all veteran Los Angeles 
chamber musicians; violinist Miwako Watanabe and cellist Robert Martin, both 
formerly of the Sequoia Quartet, were joined by violinist Joseph Genualdi and 
violist Michael Nowak. They proved a tightly knit, warmly expressive ensemble, 
well up to the demands, both technical and spiritual, of the music at hand. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began with the A-minor Quartet, in a performance of unabating 
intensity. The players brought warm lyricism to each of their parts, the 
simplest accompaniment participating in every nuance of the leading line. This 
unanimity of phrasing, the balance in feeling, gave the music strong, surging 
direction and fervent expression. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no moment seemed overwrought or overemphasized; each idea was given its 
emotional due and flowed naturally onto the next. Contrasts were never made to 
display the players' virtuosity. The performance, and the concert, peaked with 
the central movement Adagio, its religious feeling delivered beautifully with 
subtle color changes, poised balances and concentrated emotionalism. 
</P>
<P>
What can satisfactorily follow such a performance of the A-minor Quartet? 
Probably nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The C-sharp minor Quartet couldn't, and didn't, leave as strong an impression, 
even though the playing was near the same level of excellence. Singing lines, 
urgent phrasing and precise ensemble characterized this reading. The players 
built the music steadily towards the cathartic finale, which they addressed 
with remarkable aggressiveness and passion. But one listener, at least, found 
the pairing of these two works too much of a good thing. TIMOTHY MANGAN

BRYN-JULSON, OPPENS IN RECITAL AT SCHOENBERG INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Schoenberg's late-Romantic and Expressionist songs finally seem to be winning 
an ever-wider circle of performances. Phyllis Bryn-Julson surveyed the 
repertory Sunday afternoon at the Schoenberg Institute in a stunning joint 
recital with pianist Ursula Oppens, which they also recorded last week. 
</P>
<P>
Bryn-Julson -- who was last here less than a year ago in a series of concerts 
with Pierre Boulez -- need fear nothing in the way of angular Angst and 
abstraction, and she made the freely dissonant songs of "Das Buch der hangenden 
Garten" sound like spontaneous storytelling. Her voice sounded slightly hoarse 
and brittle at first, in an understated delivery close to heightened speech, 
but warmed into a fluid performance that married expressive naturalness to 
carefully calculated musical and textual point. 
</P>
<P>
In the Four Songs of Opus 2, Bryn-Julson opened up in almost Wagnerian 
expansiveness, an approach more effective in the raptures of "Erhebung" than in 
the deceptively simple balladry of "Schenk mir deinen goldenen Kamm." She has a 
big, gleaming voice, which she worked to uncomfortably overwhelming effect in 
the small hall. 
</P>
<P>
For a finale, the soprano turned to seven of the cabaret songs. There she 
proved an insinuating chanteuse, supporting all -- from the rippling effusions 
of "Galathea," to the barely veiled ribaldry of "Der genugsame Liebhaber" and 
the glowing sentiment of "Mahnung" -- with warm sound, crystalline articulation 
and generous spirit. In encore, she led the audience in a sing-along account of 
the boom-boom-boom chorus of "Seit ich so viele Weiber sah." 
</P>
<P>
Oppens accompanied with restrained brilliance, taking infinite pains with 
pedaling and color, exploding where needed with orchestral depth and bravura. 
Her effort was beautifully balanced with Bryn-Julson's, in pristine ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
For an opener, Oppens played Hanns Eisler's succinct Opus 1 Piano Sonata, 
emphasizing its motivic clarity and expressive variety in a crisp, eloquent 
performance. JOHN HENKEN

CULTURAL IDENTITY CRISIS IN 'AMERICAN EYES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adolescence is a trying time under the best of circumstances, but 16-year-old 
John Henderson has added trials: he's an adopted Asian in an all-Caucasian 
family, in an all-Caucasian town. 
</P>
<P>
How he comes through his identity crisis and comes to terms with his adopted 
family and his cultural heritage is the subject of today's 
feel-good-about-yourself "CBS Schoolbreak Special," "American Eyes" (3 p.m., 
Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
John (Jason Scott Lee) has his differences pointed out to him by a bigoted high 
school bully. He resents his adopted brother's (Brian Krause) protection and 
begins to question his place in the close-knit Henderson family. 
</P>
<P>
David Ogden Stiers, as his concerned dad, urges him to go to a Korean cultural 
summer camp for teens to find his roots. Mom (Concetta Tomei) is worried about 
losing him. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hu is the sympathetic and lovely girl John meets at camp who helps him 
break down his defensiveness and accept who he is with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Stein directed and co-wrote the script with Cynthia Cherbak and Elizabeth 
Hansen, and it is sensitive and well-acted. But how will John deal with the 
violent racial prejudice he was faced with in school? We'll never know. It 
doesn't fit into the quick-fix, happily-ever-after wrap-up. LYNNE HEFFLEY

BALANCHINE, DE RIBERE AND TOMASSON WORKS BY S.F. BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When George Balanchine choreographed "Serenade" in 1935, he was as far away in 
time from the era of Imperial Russian classicism (one of his reference points) 
as Lisa de Ribere is from the World War II home front depicted in her new 
ballet "Harvest Moon." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Balanchine had more on his mind than nostalgia, but San Francisco 
Ballet certainly heightened this element in his work by programming "Serenade" 
with De Ribere's ballet -- and with two new Helgi Tomasson evocations of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The War Memorial Opera House was nearly full on Friday for this evening of 
neo-classicism, neo-Romanticism and neo-jitterbug. No ballet company ever went 
broke by insulating its audience from the present. 
</P>
<P>
For all its inconclusive dithering with pointe-work, "Harvest Moon" proved 
essentially a Hubbard-style pop showpiece in which young dancers played 
characters out of old movies. A mirrored ballroom set by Robin Wagner and witty 
costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge created the proper wartime ambience. However, 
just as she stylized '40s social dances, De Ribere (formerly a soloist with 
American Ballet Theatre) idealized her milieu with such dream-anachronisms as 
inter-racial couples. 
</P>
<P>
Classic Glenn Miller Orchestra arrangements of such '40s standards as 
"Moonlight Serenade" and "In the Mood" sounded perfectly idiomatic under 
conductor Denis de Coteau, but De Ribere's dances looked locked-down, finicky, 
desiccated -- very long ago and far away, despite the remarkable skill, energy 
and charm of Joanna Berman, Anthony Randazzo, Christopher Boatwright and 
Antonio Castilla, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Berman and Randazzo also dominated the new Tomasson pieces -- she as the serene 
prima ballerina of "Con Brio" (a quintet inspired by 19th-Century dance 
lithographs) and he as the charismatic partner of Evelyn Cisneros in "Valses 
Poeticos" (an intimate, mercurial duet choreographed to early piano music by 
Granados). 
</P>
<P>
Both works offered exactly what Tomasson does best: glorify his dancers through 
refined and often inventive classicism. How could you not love Berman, Cynthia 
Drayer and Elizabeth Loscavio after their sweet, elegant, quicksilver 
performances in "Con Brio"? How could you resist Cisneros at her most sensuous 
and emotionally vulnerable in "Valses Poeticos"? Or Randazzo, so passionately 
absorbed in his partner that the audience didn't seem to exist? 
</P>
<P>
Michael McGraw played the Granados suite sensitively, De Coteau gave the 
undistinguished Drigo music for "Con Brio" as much care as the Tchaikovsky 
score for "Serenade," and lighting by Nicholas Cernovitch enforced the sharpest 
possible distinction between the brio and the poetico. 
</P>
<P>
The revival of "Serenade" represented one of the major achievements of the 
Tomasson directorate: a staging that renewed the work's masterpiece status with 
faultless taste and devotion while showing the San Francisco Ballet women's 
corps at its most radiant. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, perhaps, you could find more soulful performances of the "fallen angel" 
role than Sabina Allemann's pure if remote interpretation on Friday, but 
Pascale Leroy (the possessive "dark angel") and, especially, Yuri Zhukov (the 
man caught between these women) danced at the highest possible level of 
artistry. 
</P>
<P>
Forget nostalgia: Balanchine is alive and well in San Francisco. . . .

RICK DU BROW: NBC TINKERING WITH SATURDAY SCHEDULE

TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
SPRING FEVER: NBC is playing around with its important Saturday lineup, 
anchored by "The Golden Girls." Carol Burnett and Robert Mitchum are a couple 
of the prominent players. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchum's new sitcom, "A Family for Joe," gets a crack at the important 8 p.m. 
leadoff slot this Saturday. He portrays a homeless man who poses as grandfather 
to four orphans to keep them together. There was a preview at 8:30 p.m. last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As for Burnett, her new comedy series, "Carol &amp; Company," has the first of 
two tryouts right after "The Golden Girls" Saturday at 9:30 p.m. It's a nice 
spot -- usually occupied by "Empty Nest." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Cosby-led Thursday lineup, Saturdays keep NBC No. 1 -- so any 
tinkering is watched closely. 
</P>
<P>
The two nights are also great launching pads for new series -- to see if they 
have the stuff that hits are made of. 
</P>
<P>
RERUN HEAVEN: "Moonlighting" followed by "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" on 
Lifetime cable last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The perfect TV package. 
</P>
<P>
And apologies to Bruce Willis -- I never really appreciated how good he was as 
"Moonlighting's" David Addison. 
</P>
<P>
Just the right flair as David lets fly about his brother: 
</P>
<P>
"Waiter, take this man back to the kitchen -- he's not completely cooked." 
</P>
<P>
And Cybill Shepherd as Maddie Hayes: 
</P>
<P>
"You see one guy in his socks, you've seen them all." 
</P>
<P>
David to Maddie, at work: "You always this much fun early in the morning?" 
Maddie: "You're gonna die wondering." 
</P>
<P>
On April 6, by the way, Lifetime airs a behind-the-scenes look at "Molly Dodd," 
followed by the first of the season's new episodes. 
</P>
<P>
GOING IN STYLE: Really charming season finale for ABC's "Anything but Love" 
Wednesday as Hannah (Jamie Lee Curtis) marks her 30th birthday with bittersweet 
memories -- and the realization that she loves Marty (Richard Lewis). Will the 
series be back next fall? Well, let's put it this way: If ABC blows it and says 
no, it's another great candidate for Lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT. . . : Let's not hear even the slightest thought that ABC 
might not renew the Peabody Award-winning "China Beach" for next season. Still 
another great candidate for the female-oriented Lifetime, where, we should add, 
yet another ABC series (which got canceled) -- "Spenser: For Hire," with Robert 
Urich -- looks better and better as time goes by. 
</P>
<P>
MATCHED SET: Nice job by Arsenio Hall Friday with guest Jessica Tandy ("Driving 
Miss Daisy"). He even looked touched when she said that he was better known 
than she. But we can sure live without his other side -- that tasteless 
expression he uttered on another show last week, which was reported by several 
offended readers. A Paramount spokeswoman said that Hall is allowed to be "free 
and clear," and studio executives declined to comment. In short, he's getting 
good ratings. 
</P>
<P>
CORRALLED: Look, if CBS scored potently with "Lonesome Dove," its tale of a 
cattle drive, and a new movie version of "Gunsmoke" that ranked No. 7 in last 
week's ratings, shouldn't the network be thinking of a real, traditional 
Western series? CBS' "Paradise" was an amiable entry but not a genuine, bang-up 
frontier epic. 
</P>
<P>
SILVER LINING: Amid the early ratings wreckage of its three-hour, prime-time, 
nightly news, KCAL Channel 9 should be taking a close look at the work of 
newcomer David Jackson, who's quick on his feet and agreeable. But the 
station's new sports report is so pathetic that the bonehead decision to fire 
Scott St. James seems more absurd every day. 
</P>
<P>
STAR: If you tuned in Steve McQueen in "Bullitt" on superstation TBS Saturday 
night, you were watching him on what would have been his 60th birthday. He died 
10 years ago. And, oh my, was he ever trim and tough and every inch a Hollywood 
prince in "Bullitt," backed up by Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Vaughn -- and 
seeming almost part of his car in that sensational chase through San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
IT'S MAGIC: Can't wait for next Tuesday's CBS movie "Laker Girls," about the 
cheerleaders for our favorite dribblers. Do you think they'll love it in 
Boston? 
</P>
<P>
PERSPECTIVE: So there's Candice Bergen as the TV news hot-shot in "Murphy 
Brown," telling a secretary: "Please, don't feel you have to make a fuss or 
give me any special treatment because you see me on TV every week." Secretary: 
"I don't have a TV. I have a life." 
</P>
<P>
MOMENTS IN TIME: Judy Holliday shuffling her cards in the gin rummy scene of 
"Born Yesterday" on the Comedy Channel. . . . Gary Cooper dancing with the 
exquisite Suzy Parker in "Ten North Frederick" on American Movie Classics. . . 
. Lucy and Desi doing a knockout "Cuban Pete" dance number on KTTV Channel 11 
-- somehow making us understand what attracted them to each other in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
DATEBOOK: "Tour of Duty" has been an honorable series for CBS, and the Vietnam 
drama keeps on reaching for something special -- on April 14, it deals with the 
spraying of Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
BEAUTIFUL DOWNTOWN WARSAW: Wonder if the folks who make Fred Sands' TV real 
estate program saw this ad in Sunday's Times: "POLAND-WARSAW Studio apt. 380 
sf. Nr dwntwn. $20K or make ofr." Well, as any broker will tell you -- 
location, location, location. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "Sometimes I just wish I were Ozzie Nelson. He'd just say, 'Go to 
college' -- and that would be the end of that." Who said it? Howard Cunningham 
(Tom Bosley) to son Richie (Ron Howard) in "Happy Days." 
</P>

COURT TO RULE ON BAN ON WOMEN IN PERILOUS JOBS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a case that could affect millions of women, the Supreme Court said Monday 
that it will decide whether a company may ban women of child-bearing age from 
working in its plants because of potential danger to a fetus should the woman 
become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the justices agreed to decide when a school district may end 
mandatory desegregation, setting the stage for a ruling that could mark the end 
of the era of court-ordered busing. 
</P>
<P>
These two cases were among six that the justices agreed to hear during the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
In the case involving "fetal protection" policies in the workplace, women's 
rights advocates contend that, unless the high court stops the practice, as 
many as 20 million women could be denied a chance to compete for high-paying 
but potentially dangerous jobs. In hospitals, laboratories, manufacturing 
plants or offices, women can be exposed to chemicals or radiation that -- in 
the view of some experts -- can endanger a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
A federal appeals court in Chicago stunned women's rights lawyers last 
September by upholding a manufacturer's policy against letting women of 
child-bearing years work in its car battery plants. Because the plants contain 
lead, which can grievously harm a fetus, and because women can become pregnant 
unexpectedly, the company chose to exclude all of them. The only exceptions 
were for women who furnished medical certification that they were infertile. 
</P>
<P>
Several women union members challenged the policy as a violation of federal 
laws banning discrimination based on gender or pregnancy. They contended that 
it is up to the women, not the company, to decide whether they would work in a 
potentially dangerous environment. However, their attorneys said they might be 
willing to accept a policy that banned only pregnant women from dangerous jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Milwaukee had upheld the company policy on a pretrial motion 
in 1988. His decision was affirmed by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Chicago on a 7-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court opinion was unusual on at least two counts. 
</P>
<P>
Federal anti-discrimination laws govern disputes between employers and 
employees, but the Chicago court said that, in this case, it had to "balance 
the interests of the employer, the employee and the unborn child." The four 
dissenters questioned whether the law included a concern for the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, a company that adopts a clearly discriminatory policy bears the 
burden of proving it is necessary and that there are no reasonable 
alternatives. But, in this case, the Chicago court placed on the women the 
burden of proving that the policy was unnecessary and unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Judge Frank Easterbrook, a prominent Ronald Reagan appointee to the 
bench, called this "the most important sex-discrimination case in any court 
since 1964, when Congress enacted Title VII," the ban on race and sex 
discrimination in the workplace. The appeals court ruling "would allow 
employers to consign women to 'women's work' while reserving better-paying jobs 
but more hazardous jobs for men," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is exactly what the 1964 law and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 
were designed to prevent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The employer in the case, Johnson Controls Co., based in Milwaukee, is the 
largest maker of auto batteries. In 1982, it adopted its "fetal protection 
policy" after concluding that it could not rid its plants of high lead levels. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no other effective means to ensure that unborn children were 
protected. It would have been irresponsible to do anything else," said Stanley 
S. Jaspan, a company lawyer. Other major manufacturers, including General 
Motors, B.F. Goodrich and Allied Chemical, have adopted similar policies, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
In appealing to the high court, lawyers for the women and the United Auto 
Workers said that federal law against discrimination simply does not permit an 
exclusionary policy based on sex (International Union vs. Johnson Controls, 
89-1215). 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the Chicago court's ruling is the law only in the states of 
Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. In January, the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission issued a bulletin saying it disagreed with the Chicago 
court. 
</P>
<P>
In California, a state appeals court in Orange County ruled on Feb. 28 that the 
"fetal protection policy" implemented by Johnson Controls is illegal under the 
state's fair employment law. 
</P>
<P>
The state court suit arose at the Johnson Controls plant in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"The company's policy is to exclude women, not because they are pregnant but 
because they are fertile," the state appeals court said in striking down the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Company lawyers plan to appeal that ruling to the state Supreme Court. If the 
state high court were to uphold the Orange County appeals court decision, a 
"fetal protection policy" would be illegal in California, regardless of how the 
Supreme Court rules. 
</P>
<P>
In the busing case, the court will return to an issue that dominated its 
attention during the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the justices ruled unanimously that, once a school district has been 
convicted of operating a "dual" system by race, a judge may order cross-town 
busing as a remedy. But the justices have never said when, if ever, 
court-ordered busing would end. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the Oklahoma City school district was ordered to desegregate by busing 
students in all grades. But, five years later, the federal judge who imposed 
this plan declared the school system to be "unitary," as opposed to dual, and 
turned its affairs back to the school board. In 1984, the board decided to end 
busing for children in grades 1 through 4. As a result, 11 inner-city 
elementary schools became nearly all black once again. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a federal appeals court in Denver said that the district must resume 
busing in the elementary grades. The Oklahoma school board appealed to the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred school districts nationwide have operated for years under 
federal court supervision and could be affected by a Supreme Court ruling in 
the case (Board of Education of Oklahoma City vs. Dowell, 89-1080). 
</P>
<P>
(The Los Angeles Unified School District underwent nearly three years of state 
court-ordered mandatory busing that ended in 1981. It now offers a voluntary 
integration program, including magnet schools and a transfer policy that allows 
students from racially isolated neighborhoods to attend the school of their 
choice.) 
</P>
<P>
Without comment, the court on Monday let stand a ruling that a U.S. law banning 
racial discrimination does not protect non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
This case arose when a native of India was turned down for a VISA card by a 
Dallas bank because he was not a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, on a 7-6 vote, said the 
Civil Rights Act of 1866 does not cover private discrimination against 
non-citizens. Lawyers for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund 
in Los Angeles appealed the case to the high court, but only two justices voted 
to hear it (Bhandari vs. First National Bank of Commerce, 89-1258).

'DRIVING MISS DAISY,' TANDY WIN TOP OSCARS; 
</P>
<P>
ACADEMY AWARDS: DAY-LEWIS IS NAMED BEST ACTOR. STONE IS BEST DIRECTOR FOR 
'FOURTH OF JULY.' 
</P>

<P>
"Driving Miss Daisy," the surprise hit about a tart Southern matron and her 
black chauffeur, won Oscars for best picture and best actress, as Hollywood 
scattered its laurels around the globe during the 62nd annual Academy Awards 
ceremony Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone won his second statuette for best director on Universal Pictures' 
"Born on the Fourth of July," the political and psychological odyssey of 
Vietnam veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourth of July" also took an award for film editing, but those were the 
movie's only Oscars, despite eight nominations. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Daniel Day-Lewis edged aside "Fourth of July" star Tom Cruise to 
capture the Oscar for best actor for portraying Irish writer-artist Christy 
Brown's struggle with cerebral palsy in Miramax's "My Left Foot." 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Fricker was named best supporting actress for her role as Brown's mother 
in the film, which had also received nominations for best picture and best 
director after it was initially overlooked by audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In a widely expected award, London-born stage and film veteran Jessica Tandy 
was named best actress for her portrayal of the cantankerous Jewish dowager in 
"Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on Cloud 9!" the actress said as she picked up her statuette -- and became 
the academy's oldest best-actress winner at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Uhry, who won a 1987 Pulitzer Prize for the play on which "Miss Daisy" 
was based, won for best screenplay adaptation. 
</P>
<P>
The film also won the makeup award, reflecting the difficulty of making up 
actors to reflect their changing ages in the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Daisy," initially turned down by the major studios, was made by Warner 
Bros. only after producers Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck slashed its budget and 
secured additional backing from British film financier Jake Eberts. 
</P>
<P>
It nonetheless racked up nine Oscar nominations and, to date, $70 million at 
the U.S. box office, and bucked the conventional wisdom again by becoming one 
of the few films ever to win the best-picture Oscar without its director having 
been nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here for one very simple reason. Bruce Beresford is a brilliant 
director," Richard Zanuck said in accepting the best-picture Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Stone, who previously won Oscars for directing "Platoon," the best picture of 
1986, and for writing "Midnight Express," had been widely favored to win this 
year's directing Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"My deepest thanks for your acknowledgement that Vietnam is not over, although 
some people say it is," Stone said of the war in which he fought and was 
decorated. 
</P>
<P>
Denzel Washington was named best supporting actor for his portrayal of a 
maverick black soldier in the Civil War drama "Glory," distributed by Tri-Star 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to pay homage to . . . the black soldiers who helped make this country 
free," Washington said in accepting. His was the only major prize for "Glory," 
but the film also took Oscars for best cinematography and best sound. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ceremony, produced by film and TV director Gil Cates, carried an 
international theme that was supposed to reflect the growing 
internationalization of the film business and the way new communications 
technologies have helped break down cultural barriers. Several Oscar presenters 
announced prizes by satellite hookups from London, Moscow, Sydney, and Buenos 
Aires. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you have a closed society when the skies are open from Moscow to 
Beijing to, you name it, Gary, Indiana?" academy President Karl Malden said as 
the show began. 
</P>
<P>
While the Oscar telecast was seen in about 27 million homes in the United 
States last year, the show's international audience has grown to over a billion 
viewers in about 90 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood studios such as Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures say they 
currently get nearly half their film revenue abroad, with some films, such as 
Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" pulling in substantially more 
from foreign markets than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The show, broadcast on the ABC television network and hosted by actor-comedian 
Billy Crystal, was slow-paced, and lasted 3 hours and 35 minutes after opening 
shortly after 6 p.m. The show had moved back to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
of the Music Center, where it was held previously, amid grumbling about 
congestion at the much larger and older Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is expected to return to the older venue again next year. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening monologue, Crystal took some satirical jabs at modern-day 
Hollywood, as he quipped about Jack Nicholson's huge salary, Japan-based Sony 
Corp.'s takeover of Columbia Pictures, and Paramount's much-publicized fight 
with Art Buchwald over the profits from its hit, "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
Of 330 films in an opening montage, Crystal joked, "not one has yet gone into 
profit" according to Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the relatively subdued presentation contrasted with last year's show, which 
attracted a larger-than-usual TV audience but was sharply criticized by 
Hollywood insiders for its glitzy production numbers staged by producer Allan 
Carr. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier show included a song and dance by Snow White and actor Rob Lowe, 
which proved an embarrassment when Walt Disney Co. later sued the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for trademark infringement. The suit was 
dropped after the academy apologized. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ceremony included a special tribute to Japanese filmmaker Akira 
Kurosawa, who has inspired such American directors as George Lucas, Steven 
Spielberg and Lawrence Kasdan with dramas such as "Yojimbo," "The Seven 
Samurai" and "Ran." Many of those films in turn drew inspiration from 
non-Japanese sources that ranged from Shakespeare to American westerns. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosawa's "Rashomon" and "Dersu Uzala" won Oscars for best foreign language 
film, but the 80-year-old filmmaker has never been honored as best director. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't feel that I have yet grasped the essence of cinema," Kurosawa 
said in accepting a lifetime achievement award from Lucas and Spielberg. "I 
promise you from now on, I will work as hard as I can at making movies. Maybe 
by following this path, I will achieve an understanding of the true essence of 
cinema, and earn this." 
</P>
<P>
"Cinema Paradiso," director Giuseppe Tornatore's tribute to the movie culture 
of the 1940s and 1950s, captured the award for best foreign language film for 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry V," a Shakespearean adaptation that won best-actor and best-director 
nominations for 29-year-old Kenneth Branagh, won an Oscar only for best costume 
design. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros.'s "Batman," the year's biggest box-office success, was nominated 
only once, but took the prize for best art direction by Anton Furst. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which was directed by Spielberg and 
became Paramount's biggest hit last year, also won a single Oscar, for sound 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" -- nominated for best picture, best actor, and best 
director -- received only a single award for Tom Schulman's screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
"The Little Mermaid," Walt Disney Co.'s animated entry, won best song and 
original score prizes for composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman. 
</P>
<P>
"The Abyss," an underwater epic that proved to be a box-office disappointment 
for 20th Century Fox, received an Oscar for visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Oscar nominations were laced with surprises, as academy members 
overlooked some critical and box-office favorites to honor films that escaped 
wide notice before the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Among the critical favorites overlooked in this year's nominations were 
actor-director Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," which received nominations 
only for best supporting actor and best screenplay, and "Glory," which was 
bypassed for best picture, director, and screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Kim Basinger gently chided the academy for all but ignoring Lee's 
picture, which had been critically acclaimed for its tough look at race 
relations in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"It might tell the greatest truth of all," Basinger said during her appearance 
on the telecast, asserting that "Do the Right Thing" should have been among the 
best picture nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Koch Sr., a longtime film producer and director who was once Paramount's 
top movie executive, was awarded the academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Charles Guggenheim's "The Johnstown Flood" was named best documentary 
short, while Robert Epstein's and Bill Couturie's "Common Threads: Stories from 
the Quilt," about the AIDS epidemic, won for best documentary feature. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary nominees did not include Michael Moore's popular anti-General 
Motors satire, "Roger and Me" -- an exclusion that has prompted proposals that 
the academy change its documentary-nominating procedures for next year. 
</P>
<P>
James Hendrie's "Work Experience" was the best live-action short film, and 
Christoph and Wolfgang Lauenstein's "Balance" won the Oscar for best animated 
short.

SOVIETS BREAK INTO DESERTERS' REFUGE, SEIZE LITHUANIANS;

VILNIUS, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armed Soviet paratroopers broke into a psychiatric hospital here before dawn 
today to arrest about 20 army deserters who had taken shelter there after 
Lithuania declared itsindependence two weeks ago from the Soviet Union, 
government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Other soldiers, all heavily armed, took over the headquarters of the 
independent Lithuanian Communist Party in Vilnius in a sharp escalation of 
tensions in the capital of the breakaway Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is extremely tense," a party official said. "We have been 
virtually occupied by the army. There are troops and guns everywhere. We have 
been taken over." 
</P>
<P>
The military action seems likely to shatter the optimism, engendered only on 
Monday, that a political solution could be found in the crisis over Lithuania's 
determination to secede from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, seeking to ease the tensions, had 
repeated assurances Monday that the Kremlin would not seek to subjugate 
Lithuania by force, and Lithuanian politicians and Soviet generals had reached 
an agreement intended to avoid confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
Two truckloads of paratroopers, armed with AK-47 assault rifles and wearing 
camouflage uniforms, arrived at the Vilnius psychiatric hospital about 3:30 
a.m. today, according to hospital personnel, and charged through the building 
to the second-floor ward where 26 deserters had taken refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the youths, who had quit their units in the Soviet army complaining of 
harassment and brutality, resisted arrest, according to doctors and nurses on 
duty, and there was a brief but bloody battle with several of the deserters 
dragged away, leaving a trail of blood down the hospital stairs and out into 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
Two Lithuanian police officers were also beaten when they attempted to 
intervene, according to a spokesman at the Lithuanian Interior Ministry. Two of 
the soldiers appeared to have been badly injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ward where the deserters had been sheltered under Red Cross protection was 
torn apart in the melee, according to hospital personnel, with doors battered 
down, iron beds broken and windows smashed. Film shot by an American television 
crew of the incident was seized at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the young men, perhaps as many as 15, managed to escape, however, as 
nurses led them out back entrances of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Paratroopers also entered the Red Cross Hospital in Kaunas, 65 miles west of 
Vilnius, and interrogated deserters there, but left without arresting any of 
the youths sheltering there, according to ministry spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet military authorities had warned that they would arrest soldiers who had 
deserted from their units if they did not return voluntarily by last Saturday. 
The Lithuanian government had offered sanctuary to the deserters but found 
later that it had little way of honoring that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
In central Vilnius, soldiers surrounded the headquarters of the Lithuanian 
Communist Party at 7:30 a.m. as officials began coming to work and swiftly took 
over the building. 
</P>
<P>
No explanation was given for the action, party officials inside said by 
telephone. "We are sitting in our offices, and the soldiers with their guns are 
outside our doors and up and down the corridors," an official said. "It is like 
we have been captured. We have no idea what will happen. The situation is very 
tense." 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Soviet troops had occupied several party buildings, saying 
they were doing so on instructions from a faction of the Lithuanian party that 
had remained loyal to Moscow when three-quarters of the party broke its ties in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The storming of the deserters' refuge came a day after Gorbachev repeated his 
assurance that the Kremlin will not seek to subjugate Lithuania by force. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Gorbachev moved to cool the Lithuania 
crisis, saying that the Kremlin has shunned "Cold War methods" for good. 
</P>
<P>
But he also betrayed some vexation with the West's worries about the situation, 
telling his visitor that the West is trying to milk Lithuania's secession for 
political gain and taking a swipe at the United States for finding logic to 
justify its interventions in Panama and other foreign lands while rejecting 
steps taken by the Kremlin to keep order at home. 
</P>
<P>
"One's own actions, even in other countries, are measured by one standard, but 
the actions of others in their own country are (measured) by other standards 
and arouse 'concern,' " Gorbachev told the Massachusetts Democrat, according to 
the official news agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Bush Administration continued its rhetorical tightrope walk, 
trying to sound supportive to the Lithuanians without sounding provocative to 
the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"It is incumbent that both sides maintain open communications," White House 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement. "Neither side should 
undertake any actions which could preclude negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Referring specifically to Lithuania, Gorbachev said the Soviets have given 
"convincing proofs of our devotion to the new thinking, the policy of 
renouncing 'Cold War methods' and a reliance on force, respect for the right of 
the peoples to choose and to equal security." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's conciliatory remarks were published hours after Lithuanian leaders 
reached a key agreement with Soviet officers to create a committee to discuss 
how to prevent conflicts between the estimated 30,000 soldiers garrisoned in 
the republic and its 3.7 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
Both that accord, reached in Vilnius, and the switch in Gorbachev's tone 
heralded the first easing in the war of nerves waged by the Kremlin since the 
republic's March 11 declaration of independence. And Lithuania's leader at the 
Vilnius talks saw a break in the political storm clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"After coming out of the meeting today, I can see that the mood has changed," 
Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas told a news conference. "It is evident 
the conflict will not be escalated." 
</P>
<P>
Those were welcome words in the Baltic land, which spent a nerve-racking 48 
hours over the weekend as more than 100 Soviet military vehicles rumbled 
through the heart of Vilnius, helicopters swirled overhead and paratroopers 
occupied four Communist Party buildings on orders, they said, "to protect 
them." 
</P>
<P>
State-run television also did its part Monday night to soothe tensions, 
reporting that war games planned long ago were the reason the Soviet army 
suddenly assumed a high profile in Lithuania. And it assured gun owners that 
their firearms would only be impounded temporarily under last Wednesday's order 
from Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Though upbeat, Ozolas said his talks had not yielded what the Lithuanians have 
been persistently seeking: a clear commitment from the Soviets to negotiate the 
terms of independence, including who gets the $83 billion in investments that 
one Moscow newspaper said were made in a half-century of Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the beginning of negotiations," Ozolas said. "These are small steps 
toward negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Lithuanians still need to be vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is safe to say that we have passed the most dangerous period, but 
the army and the CPSU (Soviet Communist Party) are working together, and there 
is no reason for us to let down our guard," the deputy prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove Ozolas right, helicopters continued to whir through the skies of 
Vilnius, dumping loads of Russian-language leaflets that accused the republic's 
leadership of "pushing the Lithuanian nation into an abyss of uncertainty." 
They called on Lithuanians to demonstrate against the independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who has opposed Lithuanian secession as illegal, showed no changes 
in that stance in his remarks to Kennedy. He said he would wield power as 
Soviet president "to defend democracy and glasnost (openness), to ensure the 
rule of law and constitutional order, to prevent the weakening of the state and 
stop militant actions that can provoke much trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But overall, the Soviet leader's comments were not as brusque as the directives 
he issued last week demanding that Lithuanians hand over all firearms, stop 
signing up for a voluntary police auxiliary and abandon an unlawful drive for 
secession. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev on Monday also held out the promise of a "just solution" once a law 
can be passed codifying procedures for secession by any of the 15 Soviet 
republics. The Lithuanians, whose homeland was independent from 1918 until the 
Kremlin absorbed it by force in 1940, say that the Soviets have no legal claims 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
Ozolas and Lithuanian Interior Minister Marijonas Misiukonis met with Col. 
Viktor Smokarev, deputy chief of the Vilnius military garrison, and Col. 
Vladimir Trikov of the Soviet Interior Ministry, which handles law enforcement 
affairs and has its own troops. 
</P>
<P>
Ozolas said that both groups pledged not to take action affecting security 
without informing the other and agreed to the formation of the coordinating 
group to exchange information. 
</P>
<P>
The military, he said, complained of the alleged beating of a soldier and of 
shots being fired from a moving car that missed other military personnel. He 
said those incidents are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians, for their part, want to know why military aircraft keep 
buzzing their cities, why armored columns have moved through the streets and 
who ordered the takeover of the party buildings. 
</P>
<P>
No answers were immediately forthcoming, and Lithuania's president, Vytautas 
Landsbergis, even questioned Monday night how scrupulously the Soviet army 
would observe the accord. 
</P>
<P>
He told a Vilnius news conference that in Kaunas, about 60 miles to the 
northwest, gun-toting soldiers entered a former political education institute 
without warning despite the military's earlier promise to give advance notice 
of movements. 
</P>
<P>
There were also reports in Vilnius, according to the Associated Press, that 
paratroopers had occupied another building, the Communist Party committee's 
headquarters in the port of Klaipeda, 200 miles northwest of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
Asked specifically if the Soviet army's takeover of buildings in Vilnius 
constituted a "use of force," Fitzwater said in Washington:

Landsbergis, a bespectacled professor of music history who led a successful 
two-year campaign for the independence proclamation, struck a more pessimistic 
note than Ozolas about Moscow's apparent willingness now to deal. "I can't be

Kennedy said after his talks with Gorbachev that the Kremlin leader reiterated 
that he has no intention of using force to compel Lithuania to return to the 
Soviet fold.

"President Gorbachev indicated to me that the position of the Soviet Union was 
that there would be no use of force unless the lives of others were threatened 
and that he was committed to a peaceful resolution," Kennedy told a news 
conference.

The senator said that Gorbachev did not specify whose lives might be at risk in 
Lithuania, or whether he thought such threats were likely.

Official Soviet media have repeatedly expressed concern for the fate of the 20%

ON CALIFORNIA: LESSONS IN THE MAKING OF A DEMON 
</P>

<P>
In six days now Robert Alton Harris is scheduled to take his slow walk into San 
Quentin's death chamber. When he does, Harris will carry with him a demon 
mythology that has grown out of his crime. Is there anyone in California who 
doesn't know that Harris ate his victim's hamburgers? That he murdered and 
laughed? 
</P>
<P>
This demonizing of the condemned is part of the tradition of American 
executions. The demonized are easier to kill. They no longer resemble you or 
me. They are monsters from the night, and their demise brings relief and a 
certain sense of revenge. A demon's death is worth savoring. 
</P>
<P>
In Harris' case, demonizing has been no problem. Didn't he murder kittens when 
he was 9? Yes, yes. Didn't he organize the gang rape of another prisoner while 
awaiting trial? Yes, yes. Didn't his very colleagues on Death Row claim they 
would party on the day he died? Yes, yes. 
</P>
<P>
So Harris has gotten the treatment. We, the people of California can strap him 
to the green chair in the gas chamber without remorse or ambivalence. We did it 
regularly to guys just like Harris -- and an occasional woman -- 23 years ago, 
and we can do it again. 
</P>
<P>
But for anyone who's interested, there is a difference now. In the intervening 
years, we've come to understand the origins of a Robert Alton Harris and the 
way any young boy or girl gets turned into a Frankenstein. Maybe this knowledge 
doesn't affect the question of whether Harris should die. It does, however, 
make demonization more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory of that transformation is known as the family. Over the years of 
his appeals, details of Harris' family life have grown ever richer, and a 
complete picture has emerged. It is instructive. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a description of Robert's day of birth, offered by his sister in a court 
declaration. "Mother was bathing (two other children) in the bathtub, and 
father came in and starting kicking her in the abdomen, screaming that it was 
not his baby, and she fell into the bathtub. He then kicked her in the crotch 
with his combat boots on, and she began hemorrhaging. He kicked her several 
more times." 
</P>
<P>
Thus Robert was born, three months premature. Mom was a drunk like dad, and the 
fetal alcohol had taken its toll. Robert had tremors and sleep disorders. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, he was beaten by both parents, virtually every day. Mom 
preferred bamboo sticks. Dad just used his knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
The sister described it this way: "Robert couldn't walk into a room without 
father kicking or beating him. Sitting at the table, if (Robert) reached out 
for something without father's permission, he would end up with a fork in the 
back of his hand." At age 1, Robert's jaw was broken. 
</P>
<P>
The father remains convinced that Robert was sired by another man. When Robert 
would seek affection by rubbing against his mother's leg, dad would beat both 
Robert and the mother. In this family, everyone got beaten by dad. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, for no apparent reason, dad would load his guns and tell his loved 
ones they had 30 minutes to hide outside the house. He then hunted his family 
like animals, promising to shoot anyone he found. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the list of drugs, divided by ingestion technique, taken by Robert from 
age 6 through adolescence. Sniffing: airplane glue, gasoline, oven cleaner, 
paint, typewriter correction fluid. Injection: cocaine, heroin. Oral: Seconal, 
methamphetamine, PCP, LSD. 
</P>
<P>
Robert had no friends, did poorly in school, received no help for his problems. 
Before he was a teen-ager, he revealed the pattern that would dominate his 
life. He started killing neighborhood pets. The need to hurt and destroy was 
directed at everything, even himself. Once mom told Robert and a brother to go 
get switches so she could beat them. The brother brought back a small twig. 
Robert brought back a club. 
</P>
<P>
The parents were consistent to the end. Dad went to prison for sexually 
molesting his daughters and last year killed himself with a shotgun. Mom drank 
and smoked herself to death. 
</P>
<P>
We know now that families like this one create demons. We know that, contrary 
to the happy endings of Dickens' novels, most children never overcome cruelty 
on this scale. Rather, they repeat it. Death Row is full of people like Robert 
Alton Harris, and most of them have histories just like his. 
</P>
<P>
We know all this, but we haven't a clue what to do about it. Harris was well 
known to the state of California from his prior brushes with the law. He was no 
secret, just as a thousand others are no secret today. But little was done 
until he murdered. Now Harris will be a ritual sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
The demon will be dead, long live the demon.

15 ARRESTED IN CRACKDOWN ON A MAJOR MAFIA FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: INDICTMENTS AGAINST 21 PEOPLE TARGET THE NEW ENGLAND MOB ORGANIZATION. 
THORNBURGH SAYS EVIDENCE INCLUDES TAPE OF BLOOD-OATH RITUAL.

<P>
FBI agents began arresting 21 alleged mobsters Monday after Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh announced three indictments naming "virtually the entire active 
leadership and membership" of the New England Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, 15 of the 21 members of the Patriarca Family were in 
custody. The indictments accused the alleged mobsters of 113 counts of murder, 
conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, kidnaping, drug trafficking, gambling, 
wire and mail fraud, obstruction of justice and intimidation of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The case "represents a stake in the heart of a major organized crime family 
from the boss on down," and "establishes beyond doubt the existence of a 
secret, clandestine operation" -- that is, the Mafia, Thornburgh told a news 
conference here. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence obtained by federal law enforcement officials includes what Thornburgh 
termed "an unprecedented" audio tape of a blood-oath induction ceremony last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictments, Patriarca Family "boss" Raymond J. Patriarca Jr., 
of Providence, R.I., was present as four inductees had their trigger fingers 
cut to draw blood for the ritual. Speaking in Italian, they solemnly vowed: "I 
want to enter into this organization to protect my family, and to protect all 
my friends. I swear not to divulge this secret and to obey, with love and 
omerta." Omerta refers to a code of silence. 
</P>
<P>
A holy card with an image of the Patriarca family saint was then burned, with 
the inductees intoning: "As burns this saint, so will burn my soul. I enter 
alive into this organization and leave it dead." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh cited "numerous occasions where witnesses have testified as to 
ceremonies of this type," but "they have always been subject to the charge that 
they may have been embellishing on the situation." 
</P>
<P>
The tape "should lay to rest once and for all any doubts that La Cosa Nostra is 
a figment of law enforcement imagination," Thornburgh said. He declined to say 
how the tape was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Patriarca, 45, was taken in handcuffs before a U.S. magistrate in Providence 
early Monday and was ordered transferred to Boston for arraignment. Alleged 
underboss Nicholas Bianco and Mafia captain Matthew Gugliemetti were also 
arrested in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriarca Family conducted its operations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and 
Massachusetts, federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against them reflect more than five years of investigation by the 
FBI, as well as various federal, state and local law enforcement agencies 
working in New England, Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Director William S. Sessions said the indictments by grand juries in Boston 
and Hartford, Conn., demonstrated the bureau's "ability to invade the inner 
sanctums" of organized crime "with the intent to destroy them." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said "newly developing groups," from the "Colombian drug cartels to 
the Crips and Bloods in Los Angeles to the Asian organized crime groups that 
increasingly seek to control heroin distribution" face similar enforcement 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials in Washington said Monday's indictments represented a heightened 
drive that began in the early 1980s against major organized crime groups, 
especially the Mafia. The Justice Department contends that there are 25 
separate Mafia "families" in the United States, including Los Angeles, each 
varying in size, strength and influence. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years alone, federal prosecutors working with FBI agents have 
obtained more than 1,200 organized crime convictions, mainly on charges of 
political corruption, labor racketeering, illegal gambling and loan-sharking. 
</P>
<P>
The President's Commission on Organized Crime four years ago estimated that the 
illicit activities of organized crime groups accounted for an annual income of 
more than $100 billion. That represented a loss of $6.5 billion in tax revenues 
and a loss of 414,000 jobs in the American work force, the commission said.

Overweight people need better government protection from weight-loss clinics 
that advertise slimness but deliver health problems, a lawmaker probing diet 
programs said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"This subcommittee has found the medical field riddled with hucksters who ply 
their dubious wares and their miracle cures while government regulators sit 
snoozing on the sidelines," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chairman of the House 
Small Business subcommittee on regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses who said diet clinics caused them or their family members medical 
problems told their stories to the subcommittee. One woman said she had to have 
a gall bladder operation after rapidly losing weight through one clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Wyden said he was glad to see the Federal Trade Commission going after the most 
outrageous get-thin schemes, such as diet pills said to work during sleep. But 
he said a potentially greater threat is the trend toward commercial weight-loss 
clinics and physician-supervised diet programs.

JUDGE BARS FORMER HOSTAGE FROM TESTIFYING IN POINDEXTER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A federal judge refused to allow liberated hostage David P. Jacobsen to take 
the stand as a defense witness in the Iran-Contra trial of former National 
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter Monday for fear that the testimony would 
"inflame the jury." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement from the bench, U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene said 
that the testimony of Jacobsen would be "completely irrelevant" to the case. 
The defense, the judge went on, wanted him to testify because it knew that the 
wrenching story of his 17 months of captivity in Lebanon would "inflame the 
jury and create a danger of unfair prejudice" to the prosecution's case against 
Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, who was released after the Ronald Reagan Administration secretly sold 
a shipment of missiles to Iran in 1986, conferred with Poindexter as the affair 
began to unravel in November, 1986, and reportedly told him not to say anything 
publicly that would endanger the rest of American hostages held by pro-Iranian 
Islamic fundamentalists in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Richard Beckler said this "was relevant to (Poindexter's) 
state of mind in November" and would show that Poindexter was determined to be 
as careful as possible in his discussions with Congress because he knew that 
"any inaccuracy could have had a harmful effect on the safety of the hostages." 
Poindexter is charged with involvement in a conspiracy to destroy documents and 
obstruct and lie to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But Greene dismissed the defense argument and agreed with a completely opposite 
interpretation by the prosecutors: Jacobsen's testimony would probably sound to 
the jury like a justification for someone to withhold information from Congress 
in order to protect the hostages in Lebanon. But, since the defense contends 
Poindexter did not lie to Congress, the judge ruled, Jacobsen's testimony could 
not be relevant. 
</P>
<P>
Beckler showed his frustration on a day when Greene ruled against him more 
often than not on motions filed by the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to get a member of the Politburo into this court than a member of 
Congress," he shouted at one time as he complained that the House of 
Representatives had refused to let him interview 14 congressmen who had 
attended sessions in which Poindexter is accused of either lying or ordering 
his aide, Oliver L. North, to lie. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another attempt to stiff-arm us," he went on. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Tiefer, the House's deputy general counsel, told Greene that he was in 
the process of asking the congressmen if they would be willing to speak with 
Beckler. The judge told Tiefer to contact the congressmen and try to persuade 
them to be interviewed so that it could be determined if they were needed as 
defense witnesses. But the judge also lectured Beckler, saying: "All I am 
trying to do is make decisions on issues of law and when you make speeches, it 
is not helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Greene also ruled that the defense could not subpoena Victor C. Johnson, a 
staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as a witness. In a June, 
1986, memo proposing a congressional investigation into the affairs of North, 
Johnson said an inquiry would be "a good political issue." 
</P>
<P>
But the judge, accepting the prosecution's contention that no one had a right 
to lie to Congress no matter what the motivation for its investigation, said 
"it is clearly not relevant that a congressman may have had a political 
motivation, even less so by a congressional staff member."

ARMY CALLED CHINA'S BEST DEFENSE;

<P>
COMMUNISM: IT IS CALLED THE 'PILLAR OF THE PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP.' THE PARTY 
CHIEF SAYS IT MUST PLAY A GREATER ROLE.

China's army must do more to defend the Communist Party's dictatorship, while 
efforts should be boosted to eradicate the influence of Western-style liberal 
ideas within the military, Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what changes may happen in the international situation, it is of 
paramount importance for China to maintain stability," Jiang told army 
delegates to the National People's Congress in remarks paraphrased by the 
official New China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The army is "a bastion of iron in defending the motherland and can and should 
play a still greater role in ensuring stability," Jiang said, according to the 
agency's paraphrasing. The army must "give better play to its role as the 
pillar of the proletarian dictatorship," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang's comments reflect the current leadership's dependence on the military to 
preserve dominance for themselves and the Communist Party and their 
determination to solidify this power base. 
</P>
<P>
"So long as China has the People's Liberation Army as its powerful backup, 
attempts by these (Western) hostile forces are doomed to failure," Jiang said, 
according to the official news agency, "and there is absolutely no way for the 
socialist system to be abolished on the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who heads China's 48-million-member Communist Party, sharply attacked 
"bourgeois liberalization," a phrase referring to the spread of Western ideas 
of democracy, civil liberties and capitalism. He warned against allowing the 
"peaceful evolution" of China into a democratic, capitalist society. 
</P>
<P>
"He pointed out that the high sense of organization and discipline of the 
people's army is the main cause for the fact that the army is combat-effective 
and can win over the enemy," the agency reported. "Therefore, he called for 
more education in this respect and more effort to eliminate the influence of 
bourgeois liberalization on some people in the army and the resultant laxity." 
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army played a major political role in restoring order 
after the chaotic early years of the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung's 1966-1976 
Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But for more than a decade after Deng Xiaoping emerged as paramount leader in 
late 1978, stress was placed on building the army's professionalism and cutting 
down its role in politics. 
</P>
<P>
That trend was reversed when a hard-line group of mostly elderly leaders led by 
Deng, President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng called in the army last June 
to violently suppress student-led pro-democracy demonstrations. Hundreds, 
perhaps thousands, of Beijing residents and students seeking to block the 
army's path were killed when troops shot their way into the city the night of 
June 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and other foreign observers in Beijing believe that many military 
officers are angry about the loss of the army's prestige resulting from the use 
of force against the people of China's capital city. But military leaders such 
as President Yang and his younger brother, Yang Baibing, who ranks fourth in 
the military hierarchy, have achieved increased political power. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang, while lacking in military experience, heads the Communist Party's 
Central Military Commission, a post that normally carries authority similar to 
that of commander in chief. President Yang, however, is believed to exercise 
greater real authority over the army.

POLITICS: A SOCIAL DEMOCRAT BECOMES THE THIRD PARTY LEADER ACCUSED OF WORKING

<P>
East Germany's new-found democracy suffered another blow Monday as a third 
party leader faced allegations of spying for the secret police. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state prosecutors dropped treason charges against toppled Communist 
leader Erich Honecker and three top aides, including the former chief of the 
reviled Stasi security apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic leader Ibrahim Boehme told a news conference he is stepping 
aside as head of the opposition party and will not take his seat as a 
parliamentary deputy until he can clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
Boehme steadfastly denied a report by the respected West German news weekly Der 
Spiegel that an anonymous ex-officer in the Stasi had named him as a longtime 
informant who worked under a code name. 
</P>
<P>
"I have at no time worked for the Stasi," he told a press conference, adding 
that he has hired a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Boehme's self-imposed suspension appeared to further stall the 400-member 
Parliament's attempts to form a ruling coalition eight days after the country's 
first free elections. The Social Democrats placed a distant second in March 18 
elections to a three-party conservative alliance led by the Christian 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The 85,000-member Stasi has been largely dismantled since November's peaceful 
revolution, but East Germans appear to be increasingly demanding accountability 
from those who worked for one of the Cold War's most chillingly effective spy 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The organization routinely bugged telephones, opened mail and interrogated 
friends, neighbors and relatives of ordinary East Germans, as well as the 
dissidents, church members and asylum-seekers who were considered key targets. 
</P>
<P>
Public protests over plans to employ dozens of ex-Stasi officers and Communist 
functionaries in the Rostock school system forced Mayor Henning Schleiff to 
resign Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sick to think these Stasi people would have anything to do with 
the education and development of our children," one angry mother in the 
northern port town said on West German television. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker and his former Stasi chief, Erich Mielke, still face charges of 
corruption and misuse of power but will not stand trial for high treason. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office said in a statement carried by the official East German 
news agency ADN that there was insufficient evidence to prove treason against 
Honecker, Mielke, former Economics Minister Guenter Mittag and Joachim Hermann, 
who was propaganda chief. 
</P>
<P>
"The permanent violations of the constitution, which there undoubtedly were, 
resulted from the distorted Stalinistic influence of the (Communist) Party's 
leading role and should be attributed to the entire former system," the 
prosecutor's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker and his lieutenants still face charges of misuse of office and 
corruption. They are accused of skimming millions from the Communist system and 
living in relative luxury while citizens often waited years for adequate 
housing and queued up outside shops for scarce consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, has been recovering from cancer surgery in the cramped guest room 
of a village pastor. Attempts to move him to a waterfront government villa over 
the weekend in hopes of speeding his recuperation and trial were thwarted by 
angry citizens. 
</P>
<P>
While the reckoning of East Germany's old government appears to be on hold, the 
dawning of its democracy has been equally slow. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely candidate for prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere, is also 
fighting rumors that he informed for the security police. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymous rumors, carried by both East and West German media, could also 
impede reunification. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere's party was heavily backed both financially and strategically by 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party. De Maiziere 
reportedly assured Kohl that the rumors are unfounded during a post-election 
meeting in Bonn last week. 
</P>
<P>
His party won its victory despite an election-eve scandal that resulted in the 
embarrassing resignation of Wolfgang Schnur, head of Democratic Awakening, an 
alliance partner. Schnur admitted he had been a paid Stasi informant. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, a 50-year-old classical musician and human rights lawyer, 
maintains that his only contact with the Stasi was purely professional as he 
defended conscientious objectors, church members and other alleged enemies of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Werner Fischer, chairman of the independent committee overseeing dismantlement 
of the Stasi, has publicly hinted that 10% of the new Parliament members, 
including De Maiziere, may have had unseemly connections with the Stasi. Stasi 
files now sealed by prosecutors and guarded by citizen committees are said to 
name at least 40% of the adult population in this country of 16 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Boehme's party, the Social Democrats, have declared that they will 
demand a parliamentary investigation of Stasi ties among deputies as soon as 
the chamber meets for the first time. The Christian Democrats and smaller 
parties have resisted a general screening of the deputies, expressing fears 
that a "witch hunt" would deeply injure the country's fledgling democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office has said that any such investigation, to be 
constitutional, must be done by Parliament itself.

<P>
The on-again-off-again political romance between British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was off again Monday 
-- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
The two West European leaders, who are scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday in 
Britain to patch up differences over the desirability and speed of German 
reunification, are suddenly involved in another public row. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Thatcher gave a series of interviews to the West German media 
-- as did Kohl to the British press -- to attest to their friendship, a 
relationship both see as central to the fate of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In statements to the newsmagazine Der Spiegel of Hamburg, Thatcher disclosed 
Kohl's private thoughts on the German-Polish border issue that she said he 
expressed during their last meeting in December at a European summit conference 
in Strasbourg, France. 
</P>
<P>
She asserted that Kohl had said he did not recognize the current Polish border 
with East Germany. This is a subject on which he subsequently waffled in 
public, attracting widespread international criticism before he expressed 
support for the present borders. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, according to Der Spiegel, Thatcher said: "I've heard Helmut say, 
'No, I guarantee nothing, I do not recognize the present (German-Polish) 
borders.' I heard it myself after the dinner in Strasbourg." 
</P>
<P>
After learning about Thatcher's reported remarks, an infuriated Kohl sent his 
press spokesman, Hans Klein, before the media Monday to deny all. 
</P>
<P>
"The quote attributed to him is neither literally correct," said Klein, nor did 
it in any way reflect the content of any remarks made by Kohl in Strasbourg. 
</P>
<P>
As to how Thatcher might have misunderstood Kohl, Klein said flatly, "This 
question should be put to Mrs. Thatcher." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher further irritated Kohl by criticizing his legalistic view that only a 
united Germany could sign a treaty with Poland guaranteeing the present 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
She stressed, according to Der Spiegel, that only an international treaty with 
Poland could be accepted, declaring, "You know what happened to such assurances 
in the past -- West German courts overturned them." 
</P>
<P>
Klein said that comment was "unfounded and unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the interview reflected her view that Britain must respect 
German unity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get used to the idea that there will be a country in Europe that is 
stronger than all the others. We cannot always be thinking about how to create 
a counterweight to Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Thatcher have had differences in the past, and these invariably have 
been underscored in leaks to the media by their public relations people. 
</P>
<P>
They were quite compatible at first: two staunch conservatives aided by the 
third member of a Tory triangle, former President Ronald Reagan. But things 
soured. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, her people say, believes that she can never get a straight answer out 
of Kohl and, even then, he takes too long to say nothing. Kohl, his advisers 
say, believes she is an arrogant, abrupt official who has no idea of the 
difficulties facing Continental politicians -- like himself -- who govern 
through coalitions and are forced to compromise to stay in office. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier stories emanating from their respective spokesmen had indicated that 
the Thatcher-Kohl disagreement over the pace of German unification would be 
patched up Thursday, when they both speak at an Anglo-German meeting in 
Cambridge, and Friday during their scheduled private meeting in London. 
</P>
<P>
And, despite the current fracas, political observers say that after their 
Friday reunion in London, all will once again be sweetness and light -- at 
least through next weekend.

Former world champion Anatoly Karpov won the World Candidates chess final 
Monday by beating Jan Timman of the Netherlands and earned the right to a world 
championship rematch with fellow Soviet Gary Kasparov. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million championship match, the fifth between the archrival grandmasters 
in six years, will open in New York in October. 
</P>
<P>
Timman resigned after 56 moves in the ninth game, giving Karpov the victory, 6 
1/2-2 1/2. Grandmasters and chess experts said it was the best game of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to win so easily," said Karpov, who earned the lion's share of 
the $250,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
Timman said he thought that he played a good game but made a crucial mistake on 
move 39 when he played bishop to queen two. "I should have taken Karpov's king 
pawn," he said dejectedly. 
</P>
<P>
Timman said he feared defeat after losing the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that was my best game and didn't think I could win after losing it," he 
told reporters.

A former Labor Ministry official was convicted on bribery charges Monday in the 
nation's most serious financial scandal, the Recruit Co. affair that toppled 
one prime minister and contributed to the resignation of another last year. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction of Shigeru Kano was the first stemming from the scandal, which 
came to light in mid-1988 and involved payoffs in the form of cheap stock, 
contributions and entertainment to top politicians of the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party as well as prominent business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Kano, 56, received a one-year suspended sentence and was fined $8,300. He was 
put on probation for three years.

CHANCE HELD 'SLIM' FOR L.A. CLUB FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling members of the Los Angeles City Fire Department "the toughest doormen 
in town," Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said Monday that the city is in no 
danger of a fire disaster like the one in New York over the weekend in which 87 
people died because of stiff regulations and constant inspections of all public 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"It could happen here, but the likelihood is very, very slim," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some very effective tools in dealing with these problems." 
</P>
<P>
The chief added that Los Angeles apparently has fewer illegal nightclubs than 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the Los Angeles Fire Department has shut down 18 nightclubs 
for overcrowding -- four of which were operating illegally, Manning said. The 
last time a fire killed people at a local nightclub was in 1975, when five 
people were killed in a blaze at the Mecca Club in South Los Angeles, Manning 
said.

STRICTEST ABORTION BILL INSPIRES CALL FOR POTATO BOYCOTT

Faced with a potentially disastrous nationwide boycott of Idaho potatoes, Gov. 
Cecil Andrus said Monday he will seek advice before deciding whether to sign a 
measure that would become the most restrictive state abortion law in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has been passed by both houses of the Legislature, probably 
will arrive on the governor's desk today. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban all abortions except in cases of severe fetal deformity, 
threat to the mother's health or in cases of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Senate gave final legislative approval to the bill last Thursday, 
opponents of the measure have held candlelight vigils every night outside the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion-rights activists in other states have vowed to launch a nationwide 
boycott of Idaho potatoes if Andrus fails to veto the bill. Potatoes are 
Idaho's No. 1 cash crop. Idaho accounted for 27.2% of the nation's potato 
production in 1988, more than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself to be pro-life," said Andrus, a three-term Democrat seeking 
reelection. "But I reserve the right to handle this legislation the way I 
handle any other legislation."

PENTAGON REVIEW INSISTS B-2, C-17 PLANES ARE ESSENTIAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: SECRETARY CHENEY WILL BE BRIEFED ON THE ANALYSIS. IF HE AGREES, HE 
WILL GO TO BAT FOR THE WEAPONS DESPITE FIERCE OPPOSITION IN CONGRESS.

<P>
Senior Pentagon management officials plan to recommend that the United States 
proceed with production of the B-2 Stealth bomber and the C-17 transport 
aircraft and continue work on two futuristic fighter-bomber aircraft, defense 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, they are expected to offer Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney options for trimming the B-2 and C-17 program in light of pressure to 
respond to changes in the East Bloc and new fiscal constraints. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 is being built at the Northrop Corp.'s Palmdale plant, and the C-17 at 
McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Long Beach plant. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is nearing completion of its sweeping review of the four weapons 
systems, which collectively account for more than $200 billion in planned 
expenditures. Cheney is scheduled to receive briefings on the review, which he 
ordered in early January, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney is expected to make his decisions on the review's findings by next week. 
If he accepts the review's conclusion that the projects are essential, he would 
give them a major boost despite intense opposition in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
According to published reports confirmed by defense officials, the review has 
concluded that changes in the Soviet Bloc have not undercut the military's 
basic need for the $70-billion Stealth bomber program and the $37.5-billion 
C-17 cargo plane, as well as for the Air Force's and Navy's future-generation 
warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
However, in his briefing to Cheney, Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood 
is expected to outline options to delay or scale-back production programs for 
the B-2 and C-17. Both are already in production but face uphill battles on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The review also reaffirms an earlier finding in which the military said it 
needs the Air Force advanced tactical fighter and the Navy A-12 attack 
aircraft, according to reports published in the authoritative defense industry 
publications "Aviation Week and Space Technology" and "Defense News." 
</P>
<P>
The review panel's conclusion that the military rationales for the planes have 
not changed is certain to spark intense controversy in Congress. Lawmakers who 
are eager to reap a "peace dividend" from shifts in Eastern Europe have said 
the Pentagon can now cancel some of its costliest initiatives, including the 
B-2. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Cheney adopts the reviewers' options for scaling back the programs, 
he might blunt the growing congressional movement to halt the B-2 after 
Northrop builds the 16 aircraft for which funds already have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the "Major Aircraft Review" reflect the widespread reluctance 
among Pentagon officials to declare the military changes in the Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe as irreversible and to scale back defense programs 
accordingly. Cheney, who is one of the Bush Administration's leading skeptics 
toward the Soviet Union, has argued fervently against major program 
cancellations in the face of changes throughout the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, Cheney said that as a result of the review, "we may end up 
modifying the (B-2) program itself in terms of the rate at which we buy 
aircraft or the total number, total size of the buy." The Air Force maintains 
that it needs 132 B-2 bombers, at about $530 million each, to accomplish its 
missions in case of nuclear war. Under congressional orders, however, the 
Pentagon is investigating the costs and consequences of producing between 33 
and 99 of the bomber aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting with reporters, John A. Betti, undersecretary of defense 
for acquisition, said that the review has been designed to offer Cheney a "menu 
of options." Betti, who has largely guided the review, said that a group of 
fewer than 100 Defense Department officials has gone "back to ground zero, if 
you will, and (is) thoroughly evaluating requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear in all our minds that we're not going to stick with everything we 
started with," Betti added. 
</P>
<P>
But while Betti said that cancellation of any of the programs is "always 
available" as an option to Cheney, defense officials said that cancellation 
will not be one of the options the review committee will offer the defense 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
That is largely because the Defense Intelligence Agency and the review group's 
senior policy-maker, Paul Wolfowitz, have not significantly changed their 
assessment of current or future Soviet military capabilities.

</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) acknowledged that the 47-year-old building is in need 
of repair but said the Administration's call for $1.1 billion over seven years 
would be difficult to heed in a time of shrinking budgets. 
</P>

"Black or Negro" on their census forms. . . . Writing "African-American" in the

A state court victory won by an Anaheim Hills woman could be jeopardized with 
the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Monday to hear a separate suit over a Johnson 
Controls Inc. policy banning women from jobs that might endanger their unborn 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said that if the Supreme Court 
eventually upholds the prohibition it might neutralize a state appellate court 
sex discrimination case brought by Queen Elizabeth Foster, who challenged the 
policy at the company's Globe Battery Division in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, 35, who applied for a job at Globe several years ago, sued Johnson 
Controls, challenging the company's "fetal protection policy," which forbids 
women who are capable of bearing children from working on assembly lines where 
the air has a high content of toxic lead. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawsuit alleges that the company violated the California Fair Employment 
and Housing Act, a broad statute that forbids sex discrimination. She claimed 
the firm would not hire her unless she provided medical evidence that she was 
sterile. 
</P>
<P>
The state 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana ruled March 2 that the ban 
discriminated against Foster, saying, among other things, that the policy 
excluded women based on "unfounded, unscientific stereotypic notions about 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley S. Jaspan, a Milwaukee attorney for the company, said Foster's case now 
might be in jeopardy because state courts have often looked to federal court 
decisions for guidance. He also said the California Supreme Court has said the 
goals of federal and state civil rights laws are identical. 
</P>
<P>
But Foster's lawyers said the U.S. Supreme Court decision might not affect her 
case because the lawsuit involves a specific state anti-discrimination law for 
which there is no federal equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
"The United Auto Workers case was brought under federal law and that does not 
preempt state law at this point," said Catherine K. Ruckelshaus, one of 
Foster's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision relates only to the UAW's appeal of a 1989 
federal circuit court ruling in favor of Johnson Controls. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the decision to hear the case is a good idea," said Alex Sweeten, 
president of UAW Local 509, which represents 360 workers at a Johnson Controls 
Globe Battery Division in Fullerton. "Our position is that lead can affect 
males and females, but there is no ban for males. We need equal treatment for 
both." 
</P>
<P>
In Foster's case, the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission ruled in 
1987 that the policy discriminated against women and ordered the company to 
hire Foster and pay her $16,000 in back wages. 
</P>
<P>
Company attorneys have asked the 4th District Court of Appeal to reconsider its 
March 2 decision. If the request is denied, Jaspan said, the company will go to 
the state Supreme Court.

MALATHION SPRAYING DATES ANNOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mediterranean fruit fly spray zone that takes in nearly all of Garden 
Grove, half of Westminster and parts of seven other cities will get its fourth 
application of malathion Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County's other spray zone -- an area covering eight square miles in 
Brea, La Habra and Fullerton -- a scheduled round of spraying was cancelled 
Monday night because of fog and mist. 
</P>
<P>
Each zone is scheduled for two more sprayings: 
</P>
<P>
* April 16 and April 30 for the Brea area. 
</P>
<P>
* April 19 and May 3 for the Garden Grove area. 
</P>
<P>
A new supply of sterile Medflies is on its way to help fight the infestation, 
and state officials now say they expect to end the aerial spraying by May 9 -- 
a month ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
However, the accelerated schedule was announced last week before two Medflies 
were discovered in Diamond Bar and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials have not scheduled any sprayings in response to those 
discoveries, the first in weeks, but they have set more traps in the areas 
where the two Medflies were found. It is not clear how the discoveries will 
affect the eradication effort, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spraying Schedule 
</P>
<P>
State agriculture officials this week announced new aerial spraying dates for 
areas thought to be infested with the Mediterranean fruit fly. These are 
expected to be the last sprayings. Under an accelerated schedule aimed at 
ending the controversial eradication effort by May 9, the Southland spray areas 
will be hit every 14 days beginning in April. Here are the Orange County areas 
affected and the dates of spraying: 
</P>
<P>
1. Brea: (An eight-square-mile area that includes parts of Brea, La Habra and 
Fullerton): Monday, April 16 and April 30 
</P>
<P>
2. Garden Grove: (A 36 square-mile area that includes virtually all of Garden 
Grove, about half of Westminster and parts of Anaheim, Orange, Santa Ana, 
Huntington Beach, Cypress, Los Alamitos and Stanton): Thursday, April 19 and 
May 3

PATIENT HOPING FOR MARROW TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid styling gels and hair spray cans, a small decorative box sits atop the 
front counter at the Act 1 Hair Salon in Anaheim with a sign asking for 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
"Please help for Wendy's husband," begins the note stuck on the container. 
</P>
<P>
Manicurist Wendy Shaw's husband, Daniel, who turned 27 this month, has 
leukemia, and a bone marrow transplant might prolong his life. But the 
insurance policy from his employer, the CIGNA insurance corporation, does not 
cover the expensive search for bone marrow donors unless doctors approve. And 
so far, doctors have said that Shaw, among other things, is not strong enough 
to undergo such a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eddie Hu, who has treated Shaw in recent weeks, said he will consider 
requesting a donor search when Shaw's condition improves. 
</P>
<P>
But other experts contend that a search for a donor should begin as soon as the 
cancer is detected. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many centers who would say that the day you are diagnosed, you 
should start looking for a donor, although they may not do the transplant right 
away," said Robertson Parkman, head of the Division of Research Immunology at 
Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and a professor of pediatrics at USC Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
However, Parkman said there may be a problem with launching a donor search for 
every leukemia patient because the number of requests would overload the 
system. He said requests for donors should be limited to patients without 
matching siblings and in cases where chemotherapy is "not likely to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, a medical supply clerk with CIGNA, has no siblings for a possible bone 
marrow match. And the hundreds of nickels and dimes that have filled the 
container at the hair salon are hardly enough to cover the estimated $10,000 
cost of a marrow search. 
</P>
<P>
A CIGNA spokesman said Shaw's employee insurance will pay for the bone marrow 
search when his doctor authorizes it. Insurance is already paying all of Shaw's 
hospital expenses, and it will cover the transplant operation, estimated to 
cost between $150,000 and $200,000, company spokesman Del Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
In a tiny hospital room at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, Shaw 
energetically talked about the final days he and his 26-year-old wife spent 
together before he was hospitalized nearly eight weeks ago. On one day the 
couple drove around hillside neighborhoods in north Orange County looking at 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We just spent the day driving around, just dreaming and being together," said 
Shaw, who appears healthy and fit except for the loss of his hair as the result 
of radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the sun and just don't get it in here," he said, pointing at the small 
window in his room. "I'm so ready to get out of here." LISA MASCARO

COMMITTEE TO REVIEW RV PARKING LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has formed a task force to study whether parking ordinances for 
recreational vehicles need to be revised. 
</P>
<P>
About a month ago, hundreds of recreational-vehicle owners protested a proposed 
ordinance restricting where such vehicles could park on private property. 
</P>
<P>
The task force will study current city and state laws regulating where RVs and 
utility vehicles can park and make recommendations on the storage and use of 
the vehicles in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
The task force will be made up of five owners or users of the vehicles, five 
non-owners, a City Council member, a planning commissioner, a member of the 
city's Transportation and Circulation Commission and city advisory staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations drafted by the task force are expected to be forwarded to the 
City Council in about seven months for possible action. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the council considered prohibiting recreational vehicles from 
being parked on almost all residential property in the city. City 
code-enforcement officer Karen Atkinson said she had received nine complaints 
about the vehicles in January and February and 56 complaints last year. Most 
people calling said the vehicles were an eyesore, she said. TOM McQUEENEY

BID OKD FOR NEW CITY HALL COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bid to purchase a permanent city hall site was authorized by the City Council 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
City officials did not specify the size of the bid for a two-story office 
complex owned by the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
The South County developer is asking $3.4 million for the 2.3-acre site and 
buildings at 24800 Chrisanta Drive near La Paz Road. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that it will cost an additional $1.3 million to upgrade 
the existing offices for city uses. 
</P>
<P>
The city pays $32,400 a month to lease a 16,000-square-foot suite of offices at 
26522 La Alameda. The lease for the city's current offices expires in November, 
but the city has a three-year lease option. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're looking for a place to call our home," City Manager Fred 
Sorsabal said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chrisanta Drive office building features an inner courtyard and formerly 
housed the Mission Viejo Co., which developed Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William S. Craycraft was quick to distance the city from the 
development firm. 
</P>
<P>
"This transaction does not in any way deal with the Mission Viejo Co.," 
Craycraft said.FRANK MESSINA

CITY'S HELP SOUGHT FOR DAMAGED HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Robert and Faye Knapp moved to Bel Air Circle in 1973, they thought they 
had found their dream house. But when the walls, floors and back-yard patio of 
their six-bedroom home began to crack, their dream turned into a homeowner's 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Their sliding glass door won't open more than than two feet, and the floor of 
their family room has sunk so low on one side that friends say crossing the 
room is like walking up a hill. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Knapps' neighbors in the quiet cul-de-sac near McFadden Street 
and Newland Avenue have also experienced structural damage ranging from tilting 
floors and cracked foundations to doors that won't open. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners want the city to pay for damage to their homes, which they believe 
was caused by unstable soil. A group of neighbors plan to go before the City 
Council tonight to voice their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
City Engineer Neal Thompson said the damage is occurring because the houses, 
built in 1968, may have been constructed on soil containing peat -- plant 
matter that absorbs water and causes the ground to contract and expand. 
Thompson said this may have caused the homes to shift and settle. 
</P>
<P>
"Extensive testing of the soil conditions were taken before the homes were 
built and small amounts of peat were discovered, so the conditions were not 
ideal," Thompson said. "Mounds of dirt were built over the entire tract to 
compress the soil before the homes were constructed. Reports made at that time 
indicated that the soil was strong enough to support more than a two-story 
building." 
</P>
<P>
The city is mainly concerned with damage to the street, sidewalk, curb and 
gutter, said Don Vestal, director of community development. He said damage to 
homes is the responsibility of the developer, Showcase Homes in Westminster. 
William Krueger, president of the company, said he is looking into the matter 
but refused further comment on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Residents want the city to install storm drains to improve drainage because 
they say ground settling has resulted in pools of water that sit in the street. 
They also want the city to repair structural damage to the homes and reinforce 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Harland Slater said drainage problems cause water to flood "from the 
middle of the street to the middle of my driveway." Neighbors have jokingly 
referred to the area as "Slater Lake." 
</P>
<P>
"We try to have a sense of humor about it," Slater said. "But the fact is, it's 
a serious nuisance. We've had guests who have slipped and fell and come up to 
our door sopping wet." 
</P>
<P>
The city conducted soil tests last week to determine if there is still a peat 
problem with the soil, but results are not yet available, Vestal said. 
</P>
<P>
The city rebuilt the curb and gutter in the neighborhood in 1975 when similar 
problems occurred. Vestal said installing a storm drain would cost about 
$60,000 while replacing the curb and gutter would only cost a fraction of that.

HIRING HALL GETS OFF TO A SLOW START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anselmo Hernandez won the lottery on Monday, but instead of a million dollars 
he got a job. 
</P>
<P>
Because he drew a low number, Hernandez, 33, was the first dayworker to be 
hired through the city's new hiring hall. To the envy of others waiting for 
jobs, he drove off in a white El Camino to help swimming pool contractor John 
Kliese move dirt in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kliese needs extra workers on an irregular basis, usually for only one or two 
days a week. He used to drive slowly along Chapman Avenue where day laborers 
have gathered for years on street corners. But then he read in a newspaper that 
the city planned to open a hiring hall, and on Monday he showed up to hire some 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was among an estimated 250 workers drawn to the hiring hall by 
brochures that city employees distributed along Chapman Avenue in recent weeks. 
And he was one of only six laborers hired: Only four contractors had come to 
the hall by noon when it closed. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they will try to attract more employers by posting signs 
along Chapman Avenue, advertising in newspapers and telephoning local 
contractors to spread the word about the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The hall, housed in a trailer on McPherson Avenue north of Chapman, was opened 
after residents and merchants complained that the workers who congregated in 
the area were lowering property values, discouraging business and causing 
traffic jams as employers stopped to hire them. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the city is giving dayworkers a chance to find and use the hall. But 
in late April, police will begin enforcing a pair of day-laborer ordinances 
passed last September that prohibit workers from soliciting jobs on city 
streets. Violators could be fined up to $500 and sentenced to jail for up to 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this has got to be a step in the right direction," said Eric Bogart, a 
sandwich shop owner on Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the hiring hall on Monday, several workers said they came to the United 
States in search of steady work and money. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody comes to work. When the people go back to Mexico, they tell them 
there's a lot of work here," said Alfredo Jimenez, 19, who came here from 
Veracruz last year. "The money over there is worthless and the money over here 
is worth a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter, Jimenez said it takes him about 10 days of 
work in Mexico to earn what he can earn in one day in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual Alvarez said the $80 to $100 he averages for two days' work each week 
is more than he made in a week as a full-time truck driver in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
But some say that there is a price to working north of the border. Many miss 
the families they left behind. Once they are here, laborers say, dreams of big 
money remain elusive because work in Orange County is often hard to find. Some 
go weeks without working. Others complain that they are not paid for their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the dayworkers interviewed Monday said they will try using the center 
but are worried that immigration officials may show up. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are required to fill out U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service 
employment forms and provide officials at the hiring hall with some sort of 
identification. But employers are responsible for verifying the workers' legal 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not working with the INS," said Mayor Don Smith. "We want this to work." 
</P>
<P>
The hiring hall is scheduled to operate from 6 a.m. to noon Monday through 
Friday, and 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Saturdays. Employers can call ahead to line up 
workers, requesting those with specialized skills, such as carpentry, plumbing 
or silk-screening. SHANNON SANDS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN IS ACCUSED OF CHECK-KITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Dana Point woman was arrested on suspicion of using a complex check-kiting 
scheme to steal more than $50,000 from at least 10 Orange County banks, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our banks were getting hit real hard. 
</P>
<P>
We don't see kiters of this magnitude everyday," said Sheriff's Sgt. Stan 
Kinkade. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley K. Harvey, 20, was arrested Friday after a monthlong investigation on 
suspicion of opening bank accounts at 18 local and Florida banks with checks 
drawn on other accounts that already had been closed, Kinkade said. 
</P>
<P>
"The complexity of the scheme is only starting to unravel," Kinkade added. "We 
expect there might be more (banks) involved." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they believe that Harvey, who also went by the name of Trisha 
Michele Browne, worked alone. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey bought two new vehicles from South County car dealerships using funds 
obtained through the scheme, Kinkade alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey was arrested while allegedly trying to withdraw money from Dana Niguel 
Bank in the 34100 block of Coast Highway, Kinkade said. She is being held at 
County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail.

SNOWBOARDING: MAKING WAVES ON THE SLOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Australia's Gary Elkerton had just finished winning a preliminary heat during a 
surfing contest last summer in Huntington Beach, but his mind was in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
"Snowboarding is an excellent sport," said Elkerton, the second-ranked surfer 
on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals tour. "It's pretty easy for a surfer to 
catch on to and it's something real fun for us to do in the winter." 
</P>
<P>
Terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Just what your favorite ski resort needs, longer lift lines and a bunch of 
gnarly surf dudes shooting down your favorite chutes. 
</P>
<P>
What's next? Skateboarding on the cart paths at Augusta National? 
</P>
<P>
 You slide to a stop at the side of a pristine trail bordered by towering pines 
standing majestically like so many snow-dusted palace sentries. Leaning on your 
poles, you take a deep breath, hoping to capture a lungfull of tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the spell is shattered by a nails-on-a-blackboard grinding as the 
edge of a snowboard skids across the slope. There's a flash of neon colors and 
you're left with the image of a crouched figure, silhouetted by a wake of 
spraying snow as he banks out of a sweeping turn. 
</P>
<P>
 In his mind, no doubt, he was blasting off the lip of a 10-foot tube at the 
Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
In between curses, though, even the most dyed-in-the-ski-sweater-wool 
traditionalist has to admire the flowing, graceful lines of snowboarding. 
</P>
<P>
You might pine for the good old days of the early '80s, when they banned these 
things from most ski resorts, but in the back of your mind, you're saying, "It 
does look like fun." 
</P>
<P>
At least that was my view of snowboarding . . . until recently, that is, when 
my feet were affixed to one of those five-foot pieces of wood and fiberglass 
and I stood at the top of Chair No. 4 at Mountain High West in Wrightwood, 
staring down a run called "Chisolm." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it was a new perspective. The sign said, "Easiest Way Down." I wasn't 
buying it. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was after a few runs down the bunny slopes with an instructor 
and an hour of training, during which one of the axioms of learning to 
snowboard becomes intimately clear: There is no easy way down. 
</P>
<P>
At least there's no easy way to fall down. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the few sports that isn't too hard on your knees. With both feet 
strapped in, the knees are relatively safe. Snowboarding doesn't provide much 
work for the arthroscope folks, but it does wonders for the plaster business. 
</P>
<P>
Falling off a snowboard is like being pushed out of a moving car with your 
shoelaces tied together. A lot of arms and wrists get broken while attempting 
to break falls. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with a couple of decades of surfing experience and enough time on skis 
to take on the majority of ski runs, I approached snowboarding with only a bit 
of apprehension. After all, there appeared to be just two risks: serious injury 
and total self-abasement. 
</P>
<P>
One out of two ain't bad. No bones were broken. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, it only took 15 minutes to master buckling the bindings without help. And 
what's embarrassing about spending an entire day with the seat of your ski 
pants soaking wet? 
</P>
<P>
I bowled over just one lift attendant when dismounting Chair No. 2. ("Don't 
worry," he said, managing a smile, "I've been run over by bigger guys.") 
Somehow, that didn't make me feel much better. 
</P>
<P>
But the ultimate humiliation was waiting a few hundred yards down Chisolm. 
</P>
<P>
After several semi-controlled turns across the slope, I found myself almost 
able to relax. "Gee, I'm almost shredding." 
</P>
<P>
Then the downhill edge of the board bit into the snow and I found myself 
airborne. Head over heels. Heels over head. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, the bouncing stopped and the hurting started. Everything, it 
seemed, was bruised . . . ego included, thanks to a little girl of about 7 or 
8, who was wearing hot pink ear muffs and sunglasses to match. 
</P>
<P>
She snowplowed to a stop a few feet away. "You should watch where you're 
going," she said and set off down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
That pretty much sums up the way most skiers feel about snowboarders, 
especially those who have complete control of their boards and use it to 
terrorize unsuspecting skiers by carving precariously close turns that shoot 
stinging sprays of snow. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys pay the 35 bucks (for a lift ticket) like everyone else and there's 
more and more of them every day," said the assistant manager of one Southland 
resort who requested anonymity. "So most people (in the business) are trying to 
downplay the bad reputation they have. 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of them have earned that reputation. Snowboarders are the most 
obnoxious, rude and dangerous people on the hill. I know a girl who has two 
steel pins in her arm because some jerk snowboarder plowed into her and then 
split. The police are treating it as a hit-and-run accident." 
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 people have taken up snowboarding in the last three years, 
swelling the ranks to an estimated 400,000. And the snowboard industry is 
booming with technical advances making the sport more accessible every month. 
</P>
<P>
Resort owners now welcome snowboarders with open arms. After all, they are 
mostly new customers. Surveys show that about 80% began snowboarding without 
prior skiing experience. 
</P>
<P>
In some factions of the snowboard industry, there's a move afoot to change the 
name of the sport to "ski boarding," an attempt at changing the image as well. 
But as long as the sport attracts mostly aggressive young males who are the 
scourge of the hill, they'll be forever referred to by skiers as "boardheads." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the (snowboarders) that we get up here come right off the beach," 
said Michael Burian, a ski and snowboard instructor at Mountain High. "There is 
definitely a certain courtesy lacking. They're used to having to fight for 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
"But I see them changing as they begin to realize the expectations. They're not 
used to waiting in lift lines, either, but they're also not used to riding a 
20-minute wave that's always going to be there every time they get off the 
lift." 
</P>
<P>
Burian was born in Czechoslovakia and grew up skiing in Switzerland and 
Austria. He moved to the San Fernando Valley as a teen-ager and became an avid 
surfer, spending every spare moment on the beach at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, he saw a couple of guys testing a prototype snowboard on the 
slopes at Mountain High. The two worked for Tom Sims, who is credited with 
inventing the snowboard in 1975, and they gave Burian a board to try out. He 
has been a fan ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Burian has seen snowboarding evolve from outlaw status to big business. He 
understands that snowboarders often live up to their ignominious reputation. 
"But they're probably not that much worse, in general, then their same-age 
group of skiers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of snowboarders are young (18-25) and male. Burian said more 
females are signing up for classes -- "We even get some moms with their kids" 
-- but middle-aged men don't seem so eager to give up their competency on skis 
to become neophyte snowboarders. 
</P>
<P>
Elkerton said the rift between skiers and snowboarders exists in part because 
most skiers don't understand the essence of the problem. Skiing and 
snowboarding are different sports that simply have to share the same medium: a 
ski slope. 
</P>
<P>
"Skiers use a series of quick turns for control, but they take a basically 
straight track down the hill," said Elkerton. "We're carving from side to side, 
looking to make re-entries off the side walls of the run. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be hectic. We have to weave through these people and they're a bit 
dangerous, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Gary Elkerton's brother-in-law took him to a ski resort in the 
Alps. They rode up the lift to the top of the mountain. Elkerton, who had never 
skied, stood at the top and looked down. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, he just tied me into a snowboard and pushed me off the top," 
Elkerton said. "I'm not afraid of 20-foot waves, but when you're looking down a 
1,300-foot black diamond (most difficult) run, it's different. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I had trouble at first and I ran a few people down in the process. But 
by the end of the second day, I was going good. Of course, I was taking a bath 
in Tiger Balm every morning and every night." 
</P>
<P>
Too many beginning snowboarders are self-taught or buddy-taught and very few 
possess the athleticism of Elkerton. In many cases, it's just a matter of 
waiting for the accident to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Novice snowboarders soon learn that it's easier to do when you're going fast; 
it's also much easier to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Snowboarding is a lot faster than surfing," Elkerton said. "You make your 
maneuvers at a much greater speed. When I get back in the water after 
snowboarding, it seems like everything's in slow motion. I think it helps my 
surfing a lot. It makes me feel more powerful." 
</P>
<P>
The only real way to understand a snowboarder's point of view, of course, is to 
strap on a snowboard. And there probably are a lot of skiers who have no desire 
to pay the price for a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes an aggressive, no, heroic commitment to learn to snowboard," Burian 
said. "You're either standing. Or you're not standing." 
</P>
<P>
And most beginners are prone to be prone.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CHERYL LONGEWAY LIKES TO KEEP 'EM GUESSING 
</P>

<P>
Cheryl Longeway of Kennedy High School is tough to satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
Longeway, The Times' Athlete of the Week, pitched a perfect game in a 9-0 
victory over Rancho Alamitos Tuesday and, although she was pleased, it wasn't 
perfect in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Rancho Alamitos has a good team," Longeway said, "but it would have meant more 
if it was against Garden Grove." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove is the team to beat in the Garden Grove League, and Kennedy wants 
to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Longeway said, there is a lot of luck involved with pitching a perfect 
game. So even though a perfect game shows that she's a quality pitcher, it 
doesn't necessarily mean that she has complete control. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll get a batter out with a good rise (pitch) and the next time I 
face her, she might be looking for it," Longeway said. "Then I throw it and it 
won't rise or it will curve out a little so she misses again. I don't know if 
it's going to rise or curve -- I get lucky." 
</P>
<P>
If that keeps the batters guessing, they're not the only ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really have a best pitch. One game the rise will work and one game the 
drop will work," Longeway said. "I kind of keep myself guessing." 
</P>
<P>
And, to a certain point, Kennedy Coach Susan Hall is guessing too. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't coach her as far as pitching," Hall said. "I'll talk to the catcher 
and I have things to say about allowing walks, but I don't say anything to her 
about technique. She's had a pitching coach for that." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to talent and luck, Longeway now is focusing on the hitter instead 
of her pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier in the year, the umpires were really strict about emphasizing that 
pitchers drag their foot and remain on the ground," Hall said. "But everyone 
hops and the umpires call it (an illegal pitch) on everyone. Early in the year, 
Cheryl was more worried about that than the batter." 
</P>
<P>
And since she has been concentrating on the batters and not her foot, it's been 
a drag for the batters. 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Katie Beattie pitched a no-hitter and struck out eight Tuesday to lead Santa 
Margarita to an 8-1 victory over Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Brundage pitched her third no-hitter of the season and hit a solo home 
run Thursday to lead Irvine to a 6-0 victory over Laguna Hills. Brundage had 14 
strikeouts and walked one. It was her seventh career no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Gray pitched a no-hitter Thursday to lead Liberty Christian to an 11-0 
victory over Linfield Christian. Gray struck out three and walked two. The game 
was stopped after five innings because of the mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Kimble pitched a no-hitter to lead Ocean View to a 6-0 victory over 
Cerritos in the championship game of the Downey softball tournament Saturday. 
Kimble (5-3) allowed only six hits in five tournament games and was named the 
tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Silva, a sophomore, hit for the cycle to lead Whittier Christian to an 
18-11 victory over Brethren Tuesday. Silva had five RBIs and was five for five 
with two singles, a double, a triple and a three-run home run.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: SADDLEBACK'S FERGUSON FILLS ALL TEAM'S NEEDS 
</P>

<P>
Brent Ferguson starts most Saddleback College baseball practices in the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
He catches a few flies, makes a few throws, then it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
Before the day is over, he will have worked out at first and third bases and 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson doesn't protest the constant bouncing around the field, he just smiles 
and runs to the next place. He's used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been the story of my life," Ferguson said. "I've always just gone where I 
was needed." 
</P>
<P>
And no matter where Ferguson is playing, he is needed by Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who leads the team with a .400 batting average, also has a team-high 
32 hits, three home runs and 20 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Saddleback last season after being an All-Southern Section shortstop 
at San Clemente High School. He also pitched but the strain bothered his arm 
and he decided not to try pitching in college. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the team really needs me, then I will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson started in left field last season, because Saddleback had a shortstop 
and needed outfielders. An ankle injury forced him to the bench for two games 
early last season. But Ferguson came back as the designated hitter until he 
could run enough to play first base. 
</P>
<P>
He was healthy enough to return to the outfield in the final few weeks of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the injury, Ferguson batted .339 with six home runs and 21 RBIs, and 
was a second-team All-Orange Empire Conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, Jack Hodges was hired as Saddleback coach, and he considered 
moving Ferguson back to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him in a practice game and thought, 'My goodness, this is his best 
position,' " Hodges said. "And it might still be his best position, but we 
wanted him to be comfortable to start the season. He was one of our few 
returners and we needed his leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has been moved around in the batting order almost as much as on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he hit second through fifth in the order. But this season, he seems 
to have settled into the No. 2 spot behind Buster Nietzke. 
</P>
<P>
"He's cut down his swing some to hit in that position," Hodges said. "But he 
did it with no questions asked. He could have more home runs if he hit 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
In a game at Golden West two weeks ago, Ferguson lined the ball over the 
center-field fence, 417 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
He also hit a three-run home run Saturday to give Saddleback a 3-2 victory over 
Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually hitting second has been good," Ferguson said. "I see more fastballs 
and get more at-bats. But I don't care where I hit or play." 
</P>
<P>
As long as he gets to. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball poll: The two top teams in the Southern California baseball poll this 
week -- No. 1 Los Angeles Harbor (28-3) and No. 2 Cerritos (19-2) -- play a 
nonconference game at 2 p.m. Wednesday at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (20-6) is third in the poll, Rancho Santiago (19-5) is fourth, 
Fullerton (16-6) fifth, College of the Canyons (16-7) sixth, Golden West (16-6) 
seventh, Moorpark (13-7) eighth, San Bernardino Valley (15-9) ninth and 
Southwestern (12-10) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's Randy Graves, a sophomore transfer from Cal State Fullerton, is the 
leading hitter in the Orange Empire Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Graves is batting .475 with a conference-high 48 hits. He also has six doubles, 
two home runs and 24 RBIs. Graves has at least one hit in 25 of Riverside's 26 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Graves hit .295 last season for Fullerton, but made 20 errors playing shortstop 
or third base. 
</P>
<P>
He started this season at third base for Riverside but was switched to first 
base eight games ago. He has committed 13 errors this season. 
</P>
<P>
Men's track: Rancho Santiago will play host to the John Ward Invitational track 
meet at 1 p.m. Friday. The meet features teams from Rancho Santiago, Golden 
West, Moorpark, Grossmont, San Diego City and Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
John Ward won 13 conference and three state titles from 1939-64 as the track 
coach at then Santa Ana College. Ward, who died in 1968, is a member of the 
Orange County Sports Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Riverside and Cerritos colleges will be the sites of the Southern California 
Regional baseball playoffs, May 17-20. Four teams will play at each site and 
the two winners will meet the top two teams from Northern California May 24-27 
at UC Irvine. . . . Herb Livsey, an assistant coach for the Orange Coast men's 
basketball team, will be honored in Denver during the Final Four. Livsey, who 
has coached for more than 30 years and was head coach at OCC from 1969-76, will 
receive a merit award.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: FADDOUL AND KENNEDY COME THROUGH PERFECTLY

Brian Faddoul couldn't be blamed for being a bit apprehensive before starting 
his first Garden Grove League baseball game for Kennedy High School Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Faddoul walked three batters but earned a save by pitching the 
last two innings of an 8-5 victory over Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
And the week before, his teammates committed seven errors in Faddoul's only 
loss of the season -- a doubleheader sweep by Gahr in which Kennedy committed 
12 errors. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time the ball was hit, I would cross my fingers," Faddoul said. "We 
didn't have any errors that day and that was great." 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish, defending Southern Section 3-A champions, played error-free 
ball. Bolsa Grande played hitless ball . . . and walkless ball. 
</P>
<P>
Faddoul pitched a perfect game in a 3-0 victory. Only twice did the junior 
right-hander have a three-ball count on a batter. 
</P>
<P>
Faddoul, The Times' Athlete of the Week, was the most valuable player on 
Kennedy's junior varsity team last season, moving up to the varsity for the 
playoffs. But he only pitched during practice because of the dominance of 
seniors Greg Hansell (13-1) and Peter Montera (11-2). 
</P>
<P>
This season, Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal was counting on Faddoul to be one of 
two starters even before the other, Mike Stenner, was lost for the season after 
knee surgery. So Faddoul became the stopper, and Friday he shut down everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"He hung a couple of pitches that he got away with," Pascal said. "You have to 
be a little lucky to pitch a no-hitter, much less a perfect game." 
</P>
<P>
The closest call came with one out in the seventh, when shortstop Rod Rosales 
made an over-the-shoulder catch of a blooper. 
</P>
<P>
"It bounced off his chest then it went into his glove," Faddoul (3-1) said, as 
if he still had difficulty believing it. "I don't know, that was something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dolan pitched a no-hitter and struck out 10 for San Clemente and the 
Tritons defeated Capistrano Valley, 4-2, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nate Julson led El Toro to a first-place finish in the Southern Section 
swimming relays Saturday at Belmont Plaza. Julson anchored the winning 400-yard 
backstroke team and had a personal-best 48.1 seconds in his leg of the 400 
freestyle, which the Chargers also won. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Rolish pitched a no-hitter and struck out 18 for Servite in the Friars' 
4-0 victory over Bishop Montgomery Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Roshawn Sims of Esperanza was named the track athlete of the meet at the Orange 
County Championships Saturday at Rancho Santiago College. Sims won the 400 
meters in a meet-record 49.24 seconds and the 200 in 22.00. He also anchored 
Esperanza's 400 relay team, which finished second, and the victorious 1,600 
relay team.

PORT DENIES SPECIFIC INTEREST IN ACQUIRING DAVE WINFIELD

<P>
Although Angel General Manager Mike Port acknowledged that he has had trade 
talks with the New York Yankees, Port denied that he is particularly interested 
in -- or close to -- acquiring outfielder Dave Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Port said he has spoken with the Yankees "along with six other clubs." 
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of Angel special assignment scout Cookie Rojas at the 
Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., did not signify anything besides a 
normal preseason evaluation of an opposing team's talent. He said Rojas was not 
sent specifically to monitor the progress of Winfield, who missed last season 
after undergoing surgery for back problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' need for a power hitter is obvious, and Port has said that he would 
prefer a power-hitting right fielder. Port's bargaining chips are pitchers Mike 
Witt and Kirk McCaskill, who are vying for the fifth spot in the starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have nothing particular going on with the Yankees more than any 
other club, and anything we have with anybody is preliminary and 
investigative," Port said. 
</P>
<P>
Port said Rojas was in Fort Lauderdale because Rojas lives in Florida and began 
his trip at the Yankees' camp before working his way to other teams' camps 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"If Rich Schlenker (another special assignment scout) passes through Plant City 
and happens by Cincinnati's camp and has occasion to see Eric Davis, will that 
start Eric Davis rumors?" Port said. "Right now I can't tell you that we 
necessarily have anything going with anyone."

HOME RESALES UP IN O.C., DOWN IN REST OF SOUTHLAND

Sales of existing homes in California increased 8.2% in February from the 
previous month to the highest level in 10 months, as buyers decided to jump 
into the market to beat further rises in interest rates, the California Assn. 
of Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, however, only Orange County, of all the major 
residential markets, showed an increase in resale activity. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside-San Bernardino used-home 
markets slowed. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent anomaly of Orange County outperforming the fast-growing 
Riverside-San Bernardino area is a factor, industry analysts said, of the 
county's high-priced new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Resale homes do better in Orange County than in other areas because they are 
more affordable than new units, while new homes are priced low enough in other 
areas to keep sales rates ahead of those in the used-home market. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when all types of homes are grouped together, February sales were down 
in Orange County as well. 
</P>
<P>
TRW Real Estate Information Services reported earlier that sales of new and 
used homes and condominiums in Southern California fell during February to 
their lowest point since January, 1988. Only 19,558 housing units changed hands 
last month in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, 7% lower than January's total and 
8% lower than a year ago, TRW said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the decline was accounted for by a steep decline in new home 
sales, the TRW figures showed. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California housing prices have reached the point where the average 
wage earner simply can't afford to purchase a home," said Allan Lubitz, 
director of product development and communications for the TRW unit. . 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County's resale market, according to the state trade group, sales of 
single-family homes rose 11% from January's figures on a non-seasonally 
adjusted basis, but were down 10% from a year ago. The median price of a 
detached home in the county increased 1.1% to $243,285 in February from 
$240,624 in January. 
</P>
<P>
The record high for the county's single family resale market was set last July 
when the median price hit $255,897. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics for the state 
realtors group, said Orange County sales rose in February in part because 
sellers were "negotiating" and therefore some properties were "realistically 
priced." 
</P>
<P>
Home sales in the nation as a whole also suffered in February. The number of 
existing single-family homes sold fell 2.3%, to 3.44 million units on a 
seasonally adjusted annualized basis, down from 3.52 million in January, the 
National Assn. of Realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
The annualized rate represents what would be the total number of homes sold for 
all of 1990 if February's pace is sustained throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the overall surge in California in February was an 
aberration and is not likely to be sustained in part because mortgage rates are 
expected to continue rising. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no softening of interest rates," and this year's sales "will be 
slower than last year's," said Appleton-Young. 
</P>
<P>
February's figures were "not a surge, but a normal rhythm of the marketplace," 
said Sanford R. Goodkin, a San Diego real estate consultant. 
</P>
<P>
In California, 560,663 existing, single-family detached homes were sold in 
February on an annualized basis, up 8.2% from an annualized rate of 518,353 in 
January, the state realtors group reported. But the February sales were down 
6.3% from the year-ago month, the realtors group said. 
</P>
<P>
Appleton-Young said most analysts thought the Federal Reserve would ease 
interest rates, "but it was unable to do so because of (rising) interest rates 
in Japan and West Germany." As a result, mortgage rates rose, in response to 
rises in other interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Housing Finance Board said the average rate on fixed-rate mortgages 
of existing homes sold in February rose to 10.30% from 10.13% in January. That 
was the largest monthly increase since May, 1989, when the rate increased 0.25 
percentage points from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing single-family home in California rose to 
$197,184 last month, up 1.1% from $194,952 in January. The median price means 
that half the homes sold for a higher price, while half sold for less. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles region, sales dropped 16.8% from January on a non-seasonally 
adjusted basis and were down 23.6% from February, 1989. The median price in the 
region fell 1.7% to $210,123 in February from $213,753 in January. Last month's 
median price, however, was up 6.1% from February, 1989, when the median price 
was $197,991. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the median price was $95,400, down from $96,300 in January and up 
from $91,800 a year ago.

UPPER DECK'S BASEBALL CARDS SCORE A HIT;

CARDS HAVE PROVED HOT SELLERS.

<P>
The Major League lockout nearly threw the baseball card business a curve, but 
Upper Deck, the hottest commodity in that booming market, was already safe at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball card sales are typically slowest just before spring training opens. 
But with the delay caused by the teams' lockout of players, some expected the 
retail card market to suffer a prolonged sag. 
</P>
<P>
However, Upper Deck, the Yorba Linda-based manufacturer of slick -- and quite 
expensive -- trading cards, had already sold out its 1990 production before the 
32 days of negotiations between Major League teams and players ended. 
</P>
<P>
From its inception, Upper Deck has been able to overcome economic obstacles en 
route to success in a highly competitive field. 
</P>
<P>
When the firm burst on the market a year ago, it faced an uphill struggle 
competing with the entrenched card company giants Topps, Score, Fleer and 
Donruss. But Upper Deck introduced several innovations such as color action 
photos front and back, and it quickly captured the high-end market with its 
elaborately designed cards. 
</P>
<P>
A full set of Upper Deck cards -- if you can get one -- commands $55, 
contrasted with the $22 to $25 prices for one from a rival company. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball lockout would eventually have hurt retail card sales had it 
continued, Upper Deck President Richard McWilliam said. But Upper Deck already 
had orders from dealers that assured a sell-out for its entire year's 
production, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"No other company sells out," said McWilliam, 36, of Corona del Mar, who played 
the game in high school and college and has a background in accounting and real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliam was approached in late 1987 by Paul Sumner, who had "a little dream . 
. . to make Architectural Digest-quality baseball cards." 
</P>
<P>
Sumner, now 43, of Chino was at the time vice president of sales at Orbis 
Graphic in Anaheim, and he has a background in printing and holography. 
</P>
<P>
With a third partner, Sumner's boss, Boris Korbel, the men set out to produce a 
prototype card impressive enough to persuade Major League Baseball and the 
players' association to grant the firm a license to produce cards bearing team 
logos and players' photos. Joined by a fourth partner, Richard Kughn, of 
Detroit, Upper Deck has grown from a small office with six employees to a 
self-contained printing company employing 250. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking into the big leagues was not easy for the company, however. Upper Deck 
cards were shipped to retailers for the first time in March, 1989, three months 
after its competitors had their sets on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
By introducing several new features -- color photos front and back, a hologram 
scheme to prevent counterfeiting and high-grade paper stock -- Upper Deck 
immediately drew rave reviews and an unprecedented demand. It virtually created 
a high-end market for baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say their cards are for children and adults, casual 
collectors and profit-minded investors alike. They are sold through a variety 
of retail outlets, not just baseball card shops. Despite the fact that they are 
intended to have a broad appeal, Upper Deck sees its cards as the Rolls-Royce 
of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It really did take off right from the start," said Bob Lemke, publisher of 
Krause Publications' Baseball Cards, a 310,000-circulation magazine that lists 
card prices in the resale market. "They are just far and away superior in terms 
of value." 
</P>
<P>
A Topps 16-card pack retails for about 50 cents at most outlets. The suggested 
price for an Upper Deck 15-card pack is 99 cents, but the pack is routinely 
sold for $1.50 and more. At times last year, the packs were going for up to $3, 
says George France, a Fullerton baseball card shop owner. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliam says Upper Deck's innovations have inspired changes among its 
competitors. Upper Deck's foil packages, for example, prevent unscrupulous 
dealers from peeking through wrappers to see whether higher-valued players' 
cards are inside and keeping those for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Liss, a spokesman for Topps Co. Inc. of Philadelphia, the baseball card 
industry leader, said his company has since changed some of its wrappers to 
obscure the contents. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say any one company has directly influenced us," he said. "We're 
always looking at new ways of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
Although Topps, which is in its 40th year of baseball card production, does not 
release precise production figures, it claims to have sold more than 1 billion 
cards last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lemke estimates that Topps' production amounts to about 5 million copies of 
each Major League player's card; as recently as 1983, the copies numbered 
750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Upper Deck says it purposely limited its initial 1989 production to just 1 
million sets of each card, which drove up the demand. (Subsequently, Upper Deck 
printed more cards that were sold in complete sets rather than in packs of 15 
cards each. The company will not reveal how many sets.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really looking to manufacture Upper Deck cards to meet demand," said 
Donald M. Bodow, vice president of marketing for the company. "We don't want 
our cards to be generally perceived as being as easily available as a glass of 
water. They are being perceived as true collectibles." 
</P>
<P>
When Upper Deck announced its intention to limit production, it was "a first in 
the hobby where those types of numbers are jealously guarded," Lemke said. 
</P>
<P>
Upper Deck, which is privately owned, does not release its sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
Topps, which also produces candy and gum products as well as non-sports trading 
cards, posted a record $198 million in sales in the year ending Feb. 25, 1989, 
more than half of which was baseball cards. Liss said the company expects to 
surpass that this year. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball card market continues to grow each year, leaving plenty of room 
for newcomers such as Upper Deck, industry officials say. Estimates of card and 
memorabilia sales range from $400 million to $600 million a year, Lemke said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Upper Deck's McWilliam declined to say how much in royalties his firm 
pays Major League Baseball or the players' association, Krause Publications' 
Lemke estimates the fees to be about 8% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to baseball cards, the older, more scarce issues of popular 
players often resell for enormous sums. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Upper Deck card of rookie Baltimore Oriole pitcher Ben McDonald is 
reselling for $100 because the "rookie" designation was inadvertently left off 
in printing. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliam curtly denies printing errors -- such as that on the McDonald card 
and one in 1989 in which Atlanta Braves slugger Dale Murphy was reversed, 
driving up the resale value of that card to $150 -- are intentional. He points 
out that the company does not profit from resales. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, McWilliam said, Upper Deck uses a sophisticated random sorting system 
that makes the chances for getting a highly sought-after card equal in each 
pack.

Alan Rosen of New Jersey, believed to be among the world's largest baseball 
card dealers, usually has little interest in current cards, preferring to 
concentrate on the more valuable older items. This year, however, Rosen "will 
be dabbling for the first time in newer cards, in the Upper Deck cards," said 
Greg Sholes, who works for Rosen's Mr. Mint memorabilia business. "He feels 
it's a strong enough product." 
</P>
<P>
Sholes, who also buys and sells cards himself as an investment, was impressed 
by Upper Deck's entrance in the baseball card market. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally have seen nothing like it in the hobby," he said. "The demand was 
unbelievable by dealers. I'd say (Upper Deck is) a cut above." 
</P>

<P>
Upper Deck has carved out a niche in the high end of the baseball card market. 
The company's cards command a higher price because of several innovations, 
including color photos on both sides, high-grade paper and a hologram to 
prevent counterfeiting.

LESSONS OF TEXAS BOOM, BUST WERE LOST ON NEW ENGLAND 
</P>

<P>
In June, 1988, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke told banks 
that aggressive uncontrolled expansion can lead to deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Growth for growth's sake, or growth without the resources to back it up, is a 
highly risky strategy because it leaves the bank exposed when the economy turns 
down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those words read like an epitaph for the Texas banking industry, where eight of 
the 10 largest holding companies were failing, crushed by awesome credit losses 
during a bust in the oil economy. 
</P>
<P>
But up in New England, Clarke's message was a prophecy of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
Banks caught in the euphoria of a construction boom have watched the economy 
turn sour. The real estate market has tumbled, giving banks a staggering amount 
of bad loans and putting one of the region's largest banks -- Bank of New 
England Corp. -- in a fight for survival. 
</P>
<P>
These troubles echo the story in Texas, but analysts say New England should not 
have a repeat performance, even though bankers apparently failed to learn from 
mistakes made in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose they thought it could happen to dumb Texans, but not happen to wise, 
conservative Yankees," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. "Poor management shows up when the economy goes bad." 
</P>
<P>
The New England banking industry in recent months has resembled an infirmary's 
list of wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nine states that showed the biggest increases in troubled real estate 
loans from December, 1988, to last September, six were in New England, industry 
estimates show. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of Boston Corp., the region's largest bank, reported a record $125-million 
loss for the third quarter of 1989, and for the year it had a 78% drop in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of New England said losses in 1989 should surpass $1 billion, and it is 
trying to sell $6 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Bank of New England has been one of the biggest victims of the 
regional real estate slump, since it competed aggressively to make construction 
loans earlier in the 1980s, sacrificing sound credit policies in order to build 
its empire. 
</P>
<P>
The eagerness shown by Bank of New England and other banks to lend their money 
for construction projects is one of the biggest similarities to what happened 
in Texas, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The economies in both regions had been robust: in Texas the driving force was 
oil and energy; in New England it was largely the high-tech and defense 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
The growth in these economies fueled rapid buildups in office space and 
housing, providing a quick avenue for banks to boost assets by making 
construction loans. In both cases, however, this led to excessive speculation 
by developers, which resulted in overbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, as the Texas economy, and then the New England economy, began to slide, 
building projects had trouble finding tenants, developers couldn't make loan 
payments, and the banks lost money. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one big party," said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with Tucker 
Anthony Inc. in Portland, Me. "Then the party stopped, and now the hangover 
started." 
</P>
<P>
"There were projects built that should have never been built, no question," 
said Leo Spang, senior vice president of commercial real estate at Shawmut Bank 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But Spang said the trouble is more manageable in New England, partly because 
the economy is more diversified and there simply was much less speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree with that assessment and say New England should not experience 
the flurry of bank closings similar to what occurred in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"The Texas debacle was so much greater in size and magnitude," Cassidy said. 
But he added, "There are too many similarities to rule out that New England 
will become another Texas." 
</P>
<P>
Banks in Texas and in New England each made the same mistake in judgment, said 
Alex Sheshunoff, president of Sheshunoff &amp; Co., a banking information and 
consulting firm in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"They underestimated the capacity of builders to overbuild," he said. "As the 
phrase goes, 'The demand was for a million square feet of space, and 10 
developers went out and built it."' 
</P>
<P>
Some banks in New England showed more restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Fleet-Norstar Financial Group Inc. in Providence, R.I., for example, quit 
making loans for condominiums about three years ago, said Robert Lougee, a 
company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The condo market, in particular, has been a major source of troubled loans, but 
at Fleet-Norstar "there were obviously some who saw overdevelopment going on," 
Lougee said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that banking officials foresaw a downturn in the real estate 
market based on their own experiences, not on any lessons from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of the history of finance," said Robert Litan, a banking expert with 
the Brookings Institution in Washington. "No one learns from the last disaster, 
especially when they didn't have any part in it." 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, though, appears to have learned from the Texas 
experience, and analysts say regulators have been more swift to crack down on 
New England banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Here it's taking (regulators) only several weeks to realize what's going on," 
said Mas Kakutani, a banking analyst with Moody's Investors Service Inc. in New 
York. "The deterioration of New England banks has been more severe than 
anything we saw in Texas, in terms of quickness." 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly trying to reflect some of the lessons learned from Texas," 
said Seidman at the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said regulators were taking a cautious look at New England before the 
serious problems surfaced, and he said officials in the future will pay closest 
attention to banks that grow the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
"Once bitten, twice shy," he said.

JUDGE TOLD OF LINCOLN S&amp;L'S ADVANCE TO ITS HOLDING CO.

Aides to millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. ordered Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. to advance its holding company $14.2 million for taxes a month before it 
was due in 1986, a federal judge was told Monday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the government alleges that the money never was paid to the Internal 
Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
The contention came in the 13th day of a hearing in U.S. District Court on 
Keating's lawsuit, which alleges that the government takeover of the Irvine, 
Calif., S&amp;L was capricious and arbitrary. He wants the thrift returned to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
A June 30, 1986, memo containing the instructions was introduced to support 
government allegations that Keating was illegally siphoning federally insured 
deposits from the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators say the subsequent collapse of the $5.5-billion thrift could cost 
taxpayers as much as $2 billion, making it the most expensive S&amp;L failure 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
In the memo, Lincoln's chief financial officer was instructed by her 
counterpart at the thrift's holding company -- Keating's American Continental 
Corp. of Phoenix -- to make the $14,186,000 payment a month earlier than it was 
due. 
</P>
<P>
Government lawyer James Murphy said the memo bolsters regulators' contention 
that Lincoln was using complicated real estate, stock and junk bond 
transactions to book phony profits to bolster Keating's faltering real estate 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
In its April takeover of the thrift, the government contended that American 
Continental looted Lincoln of $94 million through the tax-sharing arrangement. 
Under the agreement, the holding company collected taxes due on the phony 
profits but never paid them to the IRS, the government contends. 
</P>
<P>
Although an outline of the tax-sharing arrangement had been approved by 
regulators on the West Coast, government attorneys contend it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Andre Niebling, Lincoln's chairman from mid-1985 through mid-1987, 
has refused to testify, citing a Fifth Amendment protection against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit, Niebling cited a federal grand jury in Los Angeles that is 
weighing possible criminal charges against Keating and other American 
Continental and Lincoln officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Lentz, founder of Postal-Annex+, was small potatoes when he agreed in late 
1985 to attend a lunch meeting with Anthony DeSio, president of San Diego-based 
Mail Boxes Etc., the nation's leader in privately owned postal-service 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Lentz owned three postal-service outlets -- in University City, 
San Ysidro and El Cajon -- and was planning for the day he would lay claim to 
18 stores of his own. 
</P>
<P>
The lunch was arranged because DeSio was interested in buying one of Lentz's 
sites to add yet another franchise to what was then Mail Boxes Etc.'s 
230-outlet chain, the largest provider of private mailbox rentals and related 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me if I had a price, and I said, 'No, I haven't thought about that,' 
" recalled Lentz, a retired insurance executive who had entered the 
postal-service business with encouragement from a similarly employed friend. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Lentz left the fateful meeting with a concept he had never considered: 
franchising. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, PostalAnnex+ has sold 83 franchises, including the three originally 
owned by Lentz. Last month, less than five years after the meeting with DeSio, 
Entrepreneur magazine ranked PostalAnnex+ among the top 25 new franchises in 
the nation. In fiscal 1989, the company grossed $1.5 million, more than 
doubling its 1987 revenue, and is expected to pull in $2.5 million in fiscal 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
In total outlets, PostalAnnex+ still trails Mail Boxes Etc., a publicly held 
company that has more than 1,100 franchises worldwide and recorded $2.4 million 
in profits in fiscal 1989. But the up-and-comer, PostalAnnex+, is rapidly 
gaining on a field of contenders for second place, led by Denver-based Pak Mail 
Centers of America, with 238 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz and DeSio have not spoken since their luncheon, which appears to have 
left a bitter taste in DeSio's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought up the possibility of selling that store (in University City) and 
the others," said DeSio, whose recollection of the meeting differs 
substantially from Lentz's. "We really weren't interested. The other stores 
were in pretty bad locations, losing a lot of money. As a result, we decided 
just to go ahead and take our franchisee elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Each company pursued its own expansion plan, eventually making San Diego County 
home to more than 100 alternative postal-service outlets, more locations per 
capita than any other county in the nation, industry experts say. Mail Boxes 
Etc. lays claim to 55 of them, PostalAnnex+ to 40. The rest are in the hands of 
other chains and independent operators. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz and DeSio agree that the marketplace for alternative postal-service 
stations -- which offer customers everything from post-office boxes and office 
supplies to facsimile and answering machine services -- is far from achieving 
its potential. Although there are now more than 6,000 alternative postal 
outlets nationwide, estimates of the number of outlets the national market 
could bear range from 20,000 to 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The indications are that we're far from the point that would indicate we are 
near any point of saturation," said Roger Lipton, managing director of 
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., a New York investment banking firm specializing 
in the franchising industry. "Ten years ago, people thought McDonald's had 
already saturated the marketplace. Today, they've got almost three times the 
number of stores." 
</P>
<P>
If the market could support just one private postal-service station for every 
U.S. Post Office in the nation, he said, it would mean there is room for more 
than 40,000 alternative outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"The services provided (by companies such as Mail Boxes Etc. and PostalAnnex+) 
are substantially broader and different from those provided by the post 
office," Lipton added. "And what we have found with other examples is that if 
service providers do their job professionally, the market has proved to be 
broader than anyone expected." 
</P>
<P>
Alternative postal outlets were born of a market niche created in 1979, when 
high labor costs forced the U.S. Postal Service to stop building post offices. 
The Postal Service vowed instead to place mail stations in gift shops and other 
retail outlets, to be run by independent operators. 
</P>
<P>
But the policy left a shortage of post-office boxes in many major cities. And, 
as the population base expanded, the demand for postal services increased. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc. entered the scene in 1980, offering post-office boxes to 
clients in free-standing stations for a quarterly fee comparable to that 
charged by the U.S. Postal Service. Despite the ability of companies such as 
Mail Boxes Etc. to provide some services more inexpensively than the 
government, the U.S. Postal Service did not welcome the commercial 
mail-receiving outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the U.S. Postal Service refuses to forward mail to anyone who receives 
mail at a commercial station. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Postal Rate Commissioner John Crutcher, one of five commissioners 
appointed by the President and an outspoken critic of the U.S. Postal Service, 
said: "It's ridiculous for the Postal Service not to negotiate with these 
people to handle all of the normal mail services that people need. . . . If, 
instead of fighting with them, they would make common cause with them, then the 
Postal Service would be relieved of the necessity of manning all those 
substations." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman Sharon Hamilton denied that there is any 
fear of competition with commercial outlets and described the government's 
service as more reliable and convenient. 
</P>
<P>
When Mail Boxes Etc. first opened, the bias against commercial outlets reached 
beyond the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, these businesses were called post-office drops, mail drops. It had 
a bad connotation," said Blaine Roberts of La Jolla, a member of Mail Boxes 
Etc.'s board of directors whose father, Norman, is a stockholder. "The idea was 
a lot of shady operators used them because that way people couldn't find their 
home. But now it has evolved to be a very practical and perfectly legitimate 
way to do business." 
</P>
<P>
During Mail Boxes Etc.'s first year in business, it began selling franchises, a 
dynamic expansion method that proved to be extremely successful and 
cost-efficient. Housewives, retired postal workers, schoolteachers and even 
marine biologists bought franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started this company, if we put a mirror under their nose and it 
steamed up, we gave them a franchise," Mail Boxes Etc. Vice President Bob DeSio 
said. "We qualify them a little more now." 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc. virtually invited competition, however, when it misjudged the 
market. The company now acknowledges that it granted its first franchisees 
larger than necessary territories, which, in effect, opened retail holes for 
competitors such as PostalAnnex+. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Langan, a real estate agent who, along with her husband, Patrick, 
bought a PostalAnnex+ franchise in mid-1988, said they were attracted to the 
business after becoming regular customers at a PostalAnnex+ in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We were familiar with it, we used it all the time," Langan said. "And we saw 
it being a business of the times, one that a lot of people want to use. We also 
thought it was a clean business. We're not slicing tomatoes."

TURKISH MARKET SOARS, EVEN ON THE STREET;

<P>
STOCKS: THE EXCHANGE BEGAN ACCELERATING LAST AUGUST AFTER TURKEY FULLY OPENED 
ITS EXCHANGE TO FOREIGNERS. SINCE THEN, IT CONTINUES TO RISE.

A sack of stock certificates lies half-empty in a dingy coffee house opposite 
Istanbul's Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"Stocks? Like tomatoes you know, I sell them like tomatoes," said the shabbily 
dressed "bagger" -- one of many unofficial traders who buy and sell stocks out 
on the street. 
</P>
<P>
The bizarre street trading that goes side by side with the official stock 
market would shock Western brokers. 
</P>
<P>
But enthusiasm for Turkish stocks has spread fast since Istanbul's once-sleepy 
stock exchange took off last year, growing faster than any other equity market 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The official stock index rose by more than 1,000%, according to a survey by the 
International Finance Corp., an arm of the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the streets, in what is known as the "coffeehouse exchange," baggers buy 
stocks through brokers and then resell them to eager investors, sometimes at a 
10% premium. 
</P>
<P>
The coffeehouse trading is not official, but it is legal. The baggers -- part 
of a vast and varied network of street merchants who hussle Turkey's alleys -- 
trade long after the exchange shuts at midday. 
</P>
<P>
An Anatolian peasant, his worldly cash wealth wrapped in a newspaper, makes his 
way through the shoving crowd to the bagger. Stocks quickly change hands on top 
of a car trunk. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Turks crowd the muddy back alleys behind the exchange, overjoyed by 
a rally that began accelerating last August after Turkey fully opened its 
exchange to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The market index of 50 primary companies hit a record high of 4,195 on Feb. 9, 
against 373.93 at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-share index then eased to 3,797.14 by Feb. 19, but traders anticipate 
that further buying will lift it up again soon. 
</P>
<P>
The base of 100 was computed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's rise was almost five times that of inflation-plagued Argentina, 
where equities yielded the second highest worldwide return, and eight times 
that of Thailand, which took third spot. 
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish stock market has performed way above every other market," said one 
international investment banker who asked not to be named. "Its long-term 
prospects are bright." 
</P>
<P>
Average daily trading value, which hovered near $85,000 just a year ago, has 
soared to $30 million this month -- above that of Portugal, Greece, the 
Philippines and Chile, but still tiny to with Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
The boom is being fed by foreign cash as well as by local investors, who win 
meager returns on the traditional Turkish standbys of gold and foreign 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Among early outside investors were Morgan Stanley Asset Management and Salomon 
Brothers, which last December launched an $84-million Turkish Investment Fund. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the closed-end mutual fund was off 12.5 cents at $13.875 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 45 points at 
2,590. 
</P>
<P>
"People have seen the great potentials of emerging markets," said Giles Vardey 
of Salomon Brothers. "We have a big interest in country funds, including the 
Turkish Fund." 
</P>
<P>
Other funds, institutional players and wealthy individuals followed suit, and 
the exchange's foreign relations director, Ismail Kovaci, said more large banks 
and securities houses were planning to invest in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy demand outnumbered the volume of stocks put on the market by Turkish 
companies. Most companies are family-owned and prefer to retain the bulk of 
their stock to keep control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Although high stock prices have encouraged some private Turkish companies to 
open up to the public, few others are expected to copy them in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
"In countries like ours, most companies have a passion for possession," said 
broker Yener Kaya. "We can see a mentality of the feudal landowner even in 
Turkey's very big holdings." 
</P>
<P>
Kaya's clients range from the top five holdings of Turkey to a drummer of the 
old gypsy suburb of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
In his office, potential investors line the walls, squatting on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The government plans to cash in on the stock boom and will sell chunks of 
stocks from Turkey's multibillion-dollar privatization program to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say stocks from state-owned petrochemicals giant Petkim and public 
bank and textiles conglomerate Sumerbank will be issued soon.

1989 WAS THE WORST YEAR FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS; 
</P>

SECURITY: ASSAULTS AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS JUMPED BY 45% TO A TOTAL OF 112 AND 
AMERICAN BUSINESSES EXPERIENCED A CORRESPONDING INCREASE, REGISTERING 29

<P>
An analyst who advises businesses how to offer better protection for their 
executives and personnel traveling abroad says 1989 was the worst year on 
record for terrorist attacks worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Freund, senior analyst with Business Risks International, based in 
Nashville, Tenn., said the level of terrorist violence worldwide increased last 
year to its highest level since the company began keeping statistics on 
terrorism in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Freund said terrorist incidents against businesses increased by 12% last year, 
making businesses the leading target for terrorists for the sixth straight 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in terrorist activity in 1989 came despite the lack of a single major 
incident such as the Dec. 21, 1988, terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 
which killed 270 people, including 11 on the ground, when it exploded over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, on a flight from West Germany to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Freund said the attack on Pan Am 103 was apparently the work of a radical 
Moslem fringe group angered by what it considered PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's 
softening of his stance toward Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The news media does a good job of reporting on terrorism, but a lot of 
terrorist activities happen behind the headlines," Freund said. "The Pan Am 
attack has kind of faded out of the public mind, but there were still a record 
number of terrorist attacks last year." 
</P>
<P>
There were 4,422 terrorist incidents reported worldwide in 1989, according to 
Business Risks International. That is a 16% increase from the level of 1988. 
Terrorist attacks left 8,237 people dead in 1989, a 10% increase from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bombs accounted for 1,930 of the terrorist attacks in 1989, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Attacks against U.S. interests jumped by 45% to a total of 112 and American 
businesses experienced a corresponding increase, registering 29 attacks, most 
of them in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Freund said Latin America and the Middle East, particularly Lebanon, remain the 
most violent areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America accounted for 1,964 of the total terrorist incidents last year. 
Peru, besieged by drug traffickers and leftist extremist groups, led all 
countries with 647 terrorist incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorist activity increased in Asia during the past year, as religious and 
ethnic strife intensified. Terrorist activity almost doubled in the Middle East 
and North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three years, successful attacks occurred in the United 
States, including four bombings and five assassination incidents linked to 
white supremacist and Islamic fundamentalist elements. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year's figures were not an aberration," said Gene Mastrangelo, manager of 
the risk assessment information service. "The total number of terrorist attacks 
from 1980 through 1989 is 31,426 -- about four times the total number of 
attacks recorded in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
The company's risk assessment information service monitors all forms of 
terrorism worldwide including both international and domestic acts carried out 
by indigenous groups. The service maintains a computer database containing 
information on the global scope and nature of terrorist incidents, patterns and 
trends dating back to 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Freund said the increase in worldwide terrorist activity in 1989 reflected a 
rise in attacks carried out by religious and ethnic groups seeking independence 
or greater political power within their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government monitors only international terrorist incidents, defined as 
attacks involving the citizens or territory of more than one country. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't criticize the State Department's method of reporting terrorist 
attacks," Freund said. "We just say that we monitor a broader range of 
terrorist activities worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Freund said Business Risks International publishes reports on terrorist 
activity for its clients. The reports offer the company's intelligence on 
terrorist activity and information on how to offer better protection for 
executives traveling abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a guards, guns and dogs type of company, but we do provide security 
counseling for our clients, particularly those who plan to travel to high-risk 
parts of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Freund said the company basically advises people who work for high-profile 
companies to avoid making their itineraries public, vary their travel schedules 
and make sure they have adequate security plans, including a driver trained in 
what to do in case of a terrorist attack.

<P>
YOUTH THEATRE STRIVES TO ACHIEVE GROWN-UP QUALITY

Mother Goose it's not. Nor the Brothers Grimm. 
</P>
<P>
So says Scott Davidson, who is quick to cite them as cliches of the "kiddie" 
mentality that the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre has taken pains to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"Why," he asks, "should children's theater have less depth than adult theater?" 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Youth Theatre's production of "Troubled Waters" -- which opens 
at the Moulton Theatre on Saturday under Davidson's direction -- deals with 
probing issues that rarely, if ever, have been addressed by the Playhouse's 
adult offerings. 
</P>
<P>
The play focuses on ambiguous moral choices raised by environmental issues. 
According to a program note, playwright Brian Kral got his idea for "Troubled 
Waters," which unfolds in and around the Florida Everglades, from a series of 
newspaper articles with headlines such as "Hunters Converge in 'Mercy Kill' of 
Deer." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson points out, moreover, that the production incorporates much of the 
cast's own research on the Seminole Indians, from ceremonial dances to ritual 
chants to religious beliefs such as spirit transformation. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the first time serious children's fare has been offered at the Youth 
Theatre. Two seasons ago, the troupe staged "Mother Hicks," a play about 
prejudice during the Depression. Last season, it presented "I Never Saw Another 
Butterfly," which is set in a concentration camp and deals with the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times children's theater tends to be terribly condescending," the 
27-year-old director says, "either in the script or the performance or the 
direction. Sometimes it's all three. But young people recognize when they're 
being talked down to, and eventually that alienates them from the theater." 
</P>
<P>
The Playhouse youth productions apparently have had the opposite effect. 
Attendance has grown phenomenally since Davidson became its director in 1986. 
The five-play current season has attracted 1,500 subscribers. That contrasts 
with 300 subscribers for three plays during his first year -- and that was a 
vast improvement over no subscribers and an annual show before he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we just took what had been a recreational program and changed it 
into something more ambitious and -- we hope -- more rewarding for everyone," 
Davidson says. "The actors get more out of it and so does the audience." 
</P>
<P>
The change has not gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
The Youth Theatre was named outstanding new children's theater in the United 
States last summer by the American Alliance of Theater and Education, a 
national organization for amateur children's troupes. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, Davidson and nine members of the ensemble hope to make a splash 
with "Troubled Waters" at the First International Children's Theater Festival 
in Lingen, West Germany. By last week, they had raised $9,000 of the $10,000 
needed to pay for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
At least 18 troupes from Eastern and Western Europe, the Soviet Union and the 
Middle East are also expected to be at the festival, which runs from April 13 
to 21. The Youth Theatre was invited as the sole U.S. representative. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited about all the recognition we've received," says Davidson, 
who credits the Las Vegas-based Rainbow Company -- founded in 1973 by Jody 
Johnston, who became his wife in 1985 -- with teaching him most of what he 
knows about children's theater. "I'm a product of that company," he emphasizes. 
</P>
<P>
The couple came to Southern California in 1984. Jody Johnston-Davidson was 
hired in 1986 as the Playhouse's business manager. She had taught at Cal State 
Fullerton and had worked as a theater-marketing specialist at USC. At the 
beginning of March she was named Playhouse producing director. 
</P>
<P>
"The big debate, ever since I was involved in children's theater, has been 
whether children can produce quality performances," Johnston-Davidson says. 
"The growing movement around the country is to do age-appropriate casting. 
Children play children and adults play adults. That's what we do here." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1984 -- when "Troubled Waters" had its world premiere at the 
Kennedy Center in Washington -- Kral's play was performed by an all-adult cast, 
although the central character is 13 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Progressive children's theater "is actually defined by the audience and not by 
the actors," she adds. "It's the opposite of recreational kiddie theater, which 
is really done for parents who come to watch their kids and believe everything 
is -- well -- wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Company, which Johnston-Davidson headed for a decade, had an annual 
budget of about $250,000 (four times the Youth Theatre's budget) and helped 
lead the move away from kiddie-style theater. "We started to create a group of 
very competent actors who by the age of 16 were working at a very advanced 
level," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Young actors in the United States rarely begin intensive training before they 
reach high school. In England, by contrast, she says, drama has for 50 years 
been part of the educational curriculum for kindergarten on up. "They treat 
theater just like math and science. It's a real school subject." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Youth Theatre has made training classes a major component 
of its program. Scott Davidson and associate director Joe Lauderdale teach 
"creative dramatics" and "scene study" to students ranging from 7 to 17 years 
old. They also provide instruction for handicapped youngsters who want to 
become professional actors. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the dramatists who write for children? 
</P>
<P>
"Until about 15 years ago, I could have counted the good ones on both hands," 
Johnston-Davidson says. "Two were Moses Goldberg and Aurand Harris. But others 
have come along since then, like Susan Zaeder and Brian. I'd say the quality 
and the number is rising." 
</P>
<P>
The Youth Theatre productions now run two weekends for an average of six 
performances, double what they used to. "We'd like to see about 2,500 
subscribers," says Johnston-Davidson, who believes the market for children's 
offerings hasn't been tapped. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we had a backlash in theater following the '60s." she says. "After all 
the weaving, people decided to go to business school. But now they've had 
children, and they're back. The situation is the opposite of what it was 10 
years ago. You don't have to prove to them that the arts are worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Performances of "Troubled Waters" at the Moulton Theatre are Saturday at 1 and 
4 p.m.; Sunday at 6 p.m.; April 7 at 1 and 4 p.m., and April 8 at 6 p.m. The 
theater is at 606 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Tickets: $6 adults, $3 
children. Information: (714) 494-0743 or 494-8021.

OPERA PACIFIC SELECTS 3 WORKS FOR WINTER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opera Pacific will present three operas for its 1991 winter season at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, company officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The company's fifth season will open Jan. 12 with Puccini's "Madama Butterfly." 
It will run through Jan. 19 and followed by Bizet's "Les Pecheurs de Perles" 
(Feb. 15-March 3) and Verdi's "Un Ballo in Maschera" (Feb. 20-March 2). 
Productions of the Puccini and Verdi works were designed for Washington (D.C.) 
Opera; the Bizet production was staged originally for Fort Worth Opera. Stage 
directors for the Costa Mesa performances will be named later. 
</P>
<P>
A summer program, which may include more than one work, will be announced 
within eight weeks, general director David DiChiera said in a phone interview 
from Detroit, where he is also general director of Michigan Opera Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Bizet's work signals a five-year commitment to French opera, according to 
DiChiera. The schedule will include Saint-Saens' "Samson et Dalila," in a 
co-production with Houston Grand Opera for 1992 (Beni Montresor will be the 
designer); a new production of Gounod's "Faust," directed by David Alden, for 
1993; a new production of Offenbach's "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" for 1994, and 
Meyerbeer's "Les Huguenots" for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"Butterfly" will be sung by two casts. Yoko Watanabe and Elizabeth Hynes will 
alternate as Cio-Cio San. Watanabe will sing Jan. 12, 17 and 19; Hynes will 
sing Jan. 13 (matinee) and 18. Jonathan Welch and a tenor to be named will 
alternate as Pinkerton. Welch will sing Jan. 12, 17 and 19. 
</P>
<P>
At all performances, Gail Dubinbaum, who sang Rosina in "Il Barbiere di 
Siviglia" last year for Opera Pacific, will be Suzuki; and Andreas Poulimenos, 
seen last year in Verdi's "La Traviata" for Opera Pacific, will be Sharpless. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor will be John Mauceri, an Opera Pacific veteran who led Puccini's 
"La Boheme" in 1987 and Verdi's "Aida" in 1988 at the Center. The production 
comes from Washington Opera, with sets designed by Ming Cho Lee in 1977 and 
costumes by Zack Brown in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Bizet's "Les Pecheurs" will also be double-cast. Janice Hall and a soprano to 
be named will alternate as Leila. Hall will sing Feb. 15, 21 and 23. 
Alternating as Nadir will be Marcello Giordani and Jianyi Zhang. Giordani will 
sing Feb. 15, 21 and 23; Zhang on March 1 and 3 (matinee). 
</P>
<P>
James Dietsch will be Zurga and Kenneth Cox will be Nourabad on Feb. 15, 21 and 
23. Alternates in these roles will sing March 1 and 3 (matinee). 
</P>
<P>
The conductor will be Mark Flint, another Opera Pacific veteran who conducted 
"La Traviata" and "Il Barbiere" last year at the Center. The sets by Johniene 
Papandreas and costumes by Marjorie McCown were designed for Fort Worth Opera 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In "Ballo," Leona Mitchell and Priscilla Baskerville will alternate as Amelia. 
Mitchell will sing Feb. 20, 24 (matinee) and 28; Baskerville will sing Feb. 22 
and March 2. 
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Polozov and a tenor to be named will alternate as Riccardo. Polozov 
will sing Feb. 20, 24 (matinee) and 27. Timothy Noble will be Renato at all 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor will be Louis Salemno, who recently led Puccini's "Turandot" for 
Opera Pacific at the Center. The sets and costumes by Zack Brown were 
originally designed in 1980 for the Washington Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Additional casting for all three works will be announced. Subscription tickets 
will range from $54 to $550. Information: (714) 979-7000.

CRITIC AT LARGE: THE OSCARS GO GLOBAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two things are true. One is that the Academy Award show, like a circus or a 
Doo-Dah Parade, can only be compared with itself. It's not like anything else. 
Another truth is that if you've seen one Academy Award show, you haven't seen 
'em all, despite the dread familiarity of the basic format. Each Oscar night 
acquires a personality of its own, somewhere between chaos and a shiny, limited 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
This was the international year, not only in the satellite pickups from around 
the globe, but, very movingly, in the honoring of Akira Kurosawa, the 
80-year-old Japanese filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Co-presenting the special Academy Award with George Lucas, Steven Spielberg 
said, "Most of us think of him as the greatest living filmmaker . . . one of 
the few true visionaries of film." 
</P>
<P>
The elegant, erect old man with the gray hair, the dark glasses and the sly 
sense of humor that even survived translation, drew a standing ovation. The 
expertly chosen clips from his films, from "The Seven Samurai" and "Rashomon" 
to his spectacular transliteration of "King Lear," "Ran," made clear how well 
deserved the honor was. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was another sense in which Kurosawa seemed to belong in the pantheon 
of the great filmmakers who have had hell's own time finding the money to make 
their superb but not invariably profitable films. It is a select group that has 
included D.W. Griffith, Luis Bunuel, Orson Welles, David Lean, Federico Fellini 
and other creative giants without whom film history would be poorer. 
</P>
<P>
"Kurosawa can't get a job in Japan," Spielberg remarked to a friend not long 
ago, in a mixture of indignation and astonishment. Indeed, George Lucas was 
instrumental in helping Kurosawa find financing for "Ran" and Spielberg himself 
used his own powers of persuasion to get Warner Bros. to back Kurosawa's latest 
film, "Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
The clips demonstrated what a remarkable maker of images Kurosawa is: the sweep 
of his battle scenes, the intensity of the intimate moments, the humor and the 
biting despairs. You don't wonder that "Seven Samurai" became the inspiration 
for "The Magnificent Seven." The contests between evil and a badly overmatched 
good, which nevertheless triumphs in the end, is the stuff of Westerns as well 
as Easterns, with a touch of irony that was late seeping into Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
The theme that has run through all his 27 films in 47 years (not that many, 
attesting to his struggles), Kurosawa has said, is "Why can't people be happier 
together?" And in settings both ancient and modern, George Lucas noted, 
Kurosawa has presented his theme in stories and images of awesome and tragic 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever one's feelings about the Academy Awards -- whether it is seen as a 
minor if lively amusement or as a fascinating reflection of the state of a 
still-potent medium -- this year's nominations and awards, and the show itself, 
confirm some trends that have been visible for several recent years. 
</P>
<P>
One is the voters' increasing picky discretion. The huge winner-take-all sweeps 
seem quite unlikely to happen in future as they used to. The ever-larger number 
of voters, now 4,900, admits of too much diversity of thought. The margins of 
triumph are likely to be as narrow as they were this time, although the best 
picture will always have the supreme cachet, however many other Oscars support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The other trend is in fact the internationalism itself: the voters' eye for 
work from elsewhere, in whatever language: witness the nomination for a French 
actress, an Irish film, an English film, and so on. It may well be true, 
although not inevitably so, that the home product will have a home-field 
advantage (not least because it has been more widely seen). But the movies have 
been growing more international for a long time -- pushed abroad in some 
measure by the competitive pressure of television. Costs were lower abroad, for 
a while anyway, but what was also true was that as the domestic market shrank, 
the foreign market loomed ever more important (and still does). That put a 
premium on international stars and exotic settings, which were also a contrast 
to the domesticity of television. 
</P>
<P>
What the Oscars argue, of course, is that the epicenter of movies is still 
Hollywood, gaudy and energetic, optimistic in its story-tellings, capable of 
sudden sensitivity as well as muscular action. 
</P>
<P>
Who won what begins to blur almost immediately, but the remembered excitement 
remains. And among the specifics likely to stay in mind about the 1990 show are 
the quick and large standing ovation for Jessica Tandy, by all odds the night's 
most popular winner, and the miracle of his Japanese family and friends, in 
Japan, singing "Happy Birthday" along with an audience in Los Angeles, to a 
master of film, standing, pleased and seemingly surprised, with two young 
masters of film who share his love of the not yet fully grasped possibilities 
of the medium.

WHO REALLY WON?;

<P>
OSCARS: ACADEMY VOTERS SPLIT THEIR BALLOTS, BUT THEY FAIL TO DO JUSTICE. THEY 
OVERLOOKED THE DIRECTORS OF 'DAISY' AND 'GLORY' -- AND THOSE FILMS WON A 
COMBINED SEVEN OSCARS.

When they decided to move the Oscar show back to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
we knew tickets would be tight; we didn't think they'd forget to invite the 
year's best directors. 
</P>
<P>
Where were Bruce Beresford and Ed Zwick? Where was Spike Lee? Beresford and 
Zwick, who were not nominated for best director, had their names mentioned in 
more "thank you" speeches than God, Michael Ovitz and best-director winner 
Oliver Stone combined, and their movies -- "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Glory" -- 
carted off a total of seven awards. And Lee cast a shadow over the stage 
without even being asked to come on down. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the auteur theory. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, "Driving Miss Daisy" was the evening's biggest winner, with four 
Oscars, including the one for best picture. But it will be a year with 
asterisks all over it in the record book. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone won as best director for a movie, "Born on the Fourth of July," 
that collected only one other award, for editing. "Driving Miss Daisy" won as 
best picture, making it the first film since the 1932 "Grand Hotel" to win best 
picture without even earning a nomination for its director. It was a night when 
an animated film swept the music awards, winning for its score and its calypso 
centerpiece, "Under the Sea." It was also a year when an industry audience rose 
to give a relatively unknown foreign actor -- Daniel Day-Lewis -- a standing 
ovation, proving to some cynics that -- on this occasion at least -- they know 
a little something about acting. 
</P>
<P>
The 62nd Oscar show was what it was billed to be, a wide-open race. Stone's 
"Born on the Fourth of July" was the only film given a chance at a sweep, and 
it got swept instead. It went two for eight. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the outcome was in doubt right to the end. "Driving Miss Daisy" had a 
3-1 edge on "Born" in their four previous head-to-head categories, but because 
best pictures and best directors are usually paired in the voting, no one would 
have been surprised to hear "Born" pulled out of the last envelope. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty of this year's results may have made for livelier office pools 
and Oscar parties, and after years of boring one-picture sweeps, it's 
encouraging to know the voters can split their ballots. But what did the split 
mean? With a clear choice between a film that was full of warm intentions and 
gentle performances -- "Driving Miss Daisy" -- and one that had the anger of a 
decade crammed into little more than two hours -- "Born on the Fourth of July" 
-- the voters teetered back and forth then settled on the gentle number. 
</P>
<P>
The academy blew its opportunity for a compromise when it failed to nominate 
for either best picture or best director Ed Zwick's fine Civil War epic 
"Glory," probably the most Oscar-like film released during the whole year. What 
held it back? The performance of Matthew Broderick? Zwick's TV background, 
which had some people calling "Glory" "eighteensixtysomething"? 
</P>
<P>
We'll never know, but when it came time to cast their final ballots, the 
general membership was definitely in a "Glory" mood. It won in three of the 
categories for which it was nominated. 
</P>
<P>
Beresford's absence from the formal program was certainly noted. Billy Crystal, 
calling "Driving Miss Daisy" the "movie which apparently directed itself," made 
the first reference during his opening monologue, then the parade of "Driving 
Miss Daisy" winners further drove home the point. Four times, the academy's 
live orchestra broke into that catchy "Miss Daisy" theme while winners worked 
their way to the podium to thank -- among others, but never forgetting -- their 
Australian director Beresford. 
</P>
<P>
G'day mate. 
</P>
<P>
If "Driving Miss Daisy" was the best film of the year -- if it was just one of 
the five best -- Beresford should have had a formal invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The academy didn't make a statement this year, it surrendered to the times. 
During the Reaganized '80s, while only one irreverent political film (Stone's 
"Platoon") was making it to the winner's circle, Hollywood and the academy were 
tamed by supply-side economics and the irreversible thawing of the Cold War. 
The victory by "Driving Miss Daisy" -- at both the box office and in the Oscar 
contest -- suggests that gentle we go into the '90s, as well. 
</P>
<P>
If the country was in an introspective mood, Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing" 
would have at least been in contention. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was there, as a nominee for best original screenplay, but it proved just 
one more disappointment for supporters of the year's most critically-acclaimed 
film. Several people mentioned the film's Oscar snub during arrival interviews 
on local TV, and Kim Basinger -- in what qualifies as a tense moment in the era 
of the 45-second clock -- chided the academy for overlooking the film that told 
"the greatest truth of all." 
</P>
<P>
If Lee was the victim of a backlash, so might Stone have been. Late-in-the-race 
assaults by right-wing political pundit Patrick Buchanan -- along with nay 
saying critics who repeated Buchanan's charges that Stone and co-screenwriter 
Ron Kovic had revamped history to suit their own political agenda -- didn't 
help. Similar criticisms leveled against Michael Moore's "Roger &amp; Me" are 
thought by many to have buried that movie with the academy's documentary 
nominations committee. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said Monday afternoon that the press had blithely accepted Buchanan's 
charges without giving him or Kovic a chance to respond. "I have not been 
contacted by anyone about playing 'fast and loose' with the facts," Stone said. 
"I always said these were composite characters . . . This has been an attack on 
(Kovic) that was inspired by the right wing." 
</P>
<P>
The feature documentary Oscar to the makers of "Common Threads: Stories from 
the Quilt" may ease some of the pressure on the academy's documentary 
nominations committee. The group was excoriated by critics this year for 
omitting "Roger &amp; Me" from the final ballot. Last year, the group was 
excoriated for overlooking Erroll Morris' "The Thin Blue Line." In both 
instances, committee members defended themselves by saying there were five 
better candidates than either "The Thin Blue Line" or "Michael &amp; Me." 
</P>
<P>
That argument doesn't stand up to the scrutiny of the nominees. There was not a 
better documentary in 1988 than "The Thin Blue Line," and "Roger &amp; Me" -- 
whatever its maker's lapses -- is certainly better than most of this year's 
choices. But it isn't better than the actual winner. "Common Threads," made by 
the producers of the Oscar-winning "The Times of Harvey Milk," took five names 
from the AIDS quilt and examined the impact of the lives and deaths of those 
people on loved ones left behind. It was exceptionally well-made and almost 
overwhelming in its indictments of the plague's myths and the federal 
government's lethargic response to it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if the academy is serious about maintaining an image of integrity in its 
nominations process, it must overhaul its documentary committee format and put 
the fate of documentary filmmakers in the hands of their peers.

BUDGET CRUNCH FORCES MUSEUM TO SELL BIERSTADT LANDSCAPE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE STRUGGLING SOUTHWEST MUSEUM HOPES TO RAISE $1.5 MILLION TO BOOST ITS 
ENDOWMENT FUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Southwest Museum has quietly consigned to auction an important 1864 
landscape by the American painter Albert Bierstadt in hopes of raising at least 
$1.5 million to boost the struggling museum's endowment fund. 
</P>
<P>
The Bierstadt in question, "Mount Hood in Oregon," is one of fewer than a dozen 
very large paintings completed by the artist early in his career that portray 
American landscape scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials and lawyers familiar with the situation said the Bierstadt's 
status had been clouded by litigation filed by the museum against a descendant 
of the woman who donated the work to the museum in 1926. Los Angeles County 
Superior Court records indicate that an out-of-court settlement was reached in 
the suit, which involved questions of title to the painting, only days before 
the museum shipped the painting off to Christie's in New York, where it is to 
be sold on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates of the selling price were listed by Christie's as between 
$1.5 million and $2 million, but some experts in American landscape art of the 
period have said the painting might bring as much as $4 million, depending on 
market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The work, which is 6x10 feet, had not been on public view at the Southwest 
Museum in nearly 10 years. The museum board first held discussions about 
deaccession of the Bierstadt at least two years ago after museum officials 
concluded that they would be unable to follow through on plans to increase the 
Southwest's American art holdings, establishing a 
collection-within-the-collection of which the Bierstadt would have been a 
nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
"Mount Hood in Oregon" is significant, experts said, because it is one of 
perhaps only a half dozen large examples of Bierstadt's work in which the 
subject is a faithfully portrayed, strictly American scene. The painting was 
one of six or seven Bierstadt works exhibited at the 1876 Philadelphia 
Centennial celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The work is from the early period of Bierstadt's career when he was 
establishing himself as one of the most commercially successful painters of his 
time. Bierstadt first saw the Rocky Mountains in 1858 when he served as a 
member of a government survey party. He went on to create a body of Western 
landscape scenes that became immensely popular in the 1860s and 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
As Bierstadt matured, however, he began to mix details of European scenes into 
his work. His taste for grandiose landscape portrayals subsided and Bierstadt's 
reputation went into eclipse. A native of Germany, Bierstadt came to the United 
States in 1832 and died in New York in 1902 at the age of 72. 
</P>
<P>
Court records indicate the litigation, between the Southwest Museum and John 
Farquhar, apparently an heir to the estate of Georgina Jones, who originally 
gave the painting to the museum, was settled on Feb. 22. But the records also 
show the existence of a confidentiality agreement between the museum and 
Farquhar under which both parties agreed to keep all details of the court 
proceeding secret. 
</P>
<P>
File records and other information about the case obtained by The Times, 
however, indicate that the suit over title to the painting led to negotiations 
last year that apparently centered on Farquhar's assertion that he was entitled 
to share in proceeds from the sale. At one point, the museum agreed to abide by 
a requirement that the painting be sold by the end of 1991 as a condition for 
terminating the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The court file also showed that discussions were held about setting up an 
interest-bearing account for money generated by the auction, pending resolution 
of the suit. Sources familiar with the litigation said the judge hearing the 
case strongly urged both sides to reach an out-of-court resolution late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Selmer, the museum's director, declined to discuss the case. Timothy J. 
Harris, a lawyer representing Farquhar, refused to provide details, as well. 
Harris specifically declined even to say where Farquhar resides. 
</P>
<P>
"The board decided they would (sell the painting off). It has been discussed 
over the years," said Selmer. "The decision (about what to do with the money) 
hasn't really been made yet. There have been some informal discussions, but no 
action has been taken on that yet." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Southwest Museum has struggled to cope with budget 
problems that at one point led the museum to enter into merger negotiations 
with the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. At the height of the 
budget crunch, the museum temporarily closed its library -- reopening the 
facility only after receipt of a large cash donation from television preacher 
Gene Scott.

The defense rested its case today in the Iran-Contra cover-up trial of former 
national security adviser John M. Poindexter, after 5 1/2 days of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The case drew to a close without any testimony from Poindexter, who is accused 
of concealing from Congress the U.S. role in a November, 1985, Iran arms 
shipment and Oliver L. North's secret military assistance to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Among the final witnesses for Poindexter was Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove), who testified that there were frequent meetings between North and up to 
30 congressmen during the period of a congressional ban on military aid to the 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
At the meetings, North was told by the congressmen that "we don't think you are 
limited" by the ban and that it was permissible for North to help raise money 
for the Contras, Dornan testified. 
</P>
<P>
Since the defense opened its case March 20, Poindexter's lawyers have sought to 
portray the ex-national security adviser as a White House official who never 
lied to Congress.

Authorities in San Bernardino County are searching for Jeanette Lynn Hughes, 
who escaped Sunday night from the California Institution for Women at Frontera 
near Chino, where she was serving a 25-year murder sentence for her role in her 
husband's 1984 death in their Huntington Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, 36, disappeared in the late afternoon after visiting with her father, 
James Tugwell, in the visitors' lounge. 
</P>
<P>
She was discovered missing about 9:20 p.m. Associate Warden Ross Dykes said 
today that officials have no idea how she escaped and are satisfied that her 
father was not involved. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first escape in four years from the state's only maximum-security 
prison for women. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was convicted in 1986 for the shooting death of her husband, James 
Hughes. She later confessed that he was shot by her lover, Adam Ramirez, in a 
scheme to obtain $442,000 from his life insurance.

A woman serving a maximum life sentence for killing her husband in 1984 escaped 
from the California Institution for Women at Frontera near Chino, apparently 
after a visit with her father, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanette Hughes, 36, was discovered missing about 9 p.m. Sunday, when visiting 
hours ended, said Ross Dykes, associate warden at the women's prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials searched the open visiting room, Hughes' housing facility and 
checked the prison grounds with dogs before determining about midnight that she 
was not inside the facility's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, formerly of Huntington Beach, was sentenced in 1986 to 26 years to life 
for the slaying two years earlier of her husband, James.

CUBAN JAMMING BLINDFOLDS TV MARTI AS U.S. BEAMS TEST SIGNAL

<P>
A U.S.-financed television operation began transmitting signals to Cuba early 
today, but Cuban officials blocked the transmission after 38 minutes and 
accused the United States of engaging in aggressive activity. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed the debut of TV Marti and said 
the Administration planned to continue efforts to transmit news and 
entertainment programs to Cuba despite the successful jamming effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hope that at some point they see the light," Fitzwater said, alluding 
to Cuban officials. He said the operation is consistent with national and 
international law. 
</P>
<P>
The TV test operation began at 1:30 a.m. EST and was clearly visible on Channel 
13 in the Havana area until the jamming began at 2:08, said a Voice of America 
official, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said in a dispatch monitored in 
Mexico City that "Cuban authorities have warned that the beginning of these 
transmissions may form part of a larger maneuver and Washington may be looking 
for a pretext to unleash military aggression." 
</P>
<P>
The station is designed to be a TV version of Radio Marti, which has provided 
news and entertainment to Cuban listeners since 1985. Radio Marti was not 
jammed this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The TV signal was sent from a transmitter placed aboard a balloon dangling 
10,000 feet above Cudjoe Key off the south Florida coast. Technical problems 
have delayed testing for months.

If the operation proves feasible on both counts, formal programming can begin

Sir Winston Churchill's grandson, saluting Dwight D. Eisenhower on behalf of 
his wartime "comrades-in-arms," joined Americans today in honoring the man who 
led Allied armies to victory in World War II and became the 34th President of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It was under the command of General Eisenhower that Europe -- or at least half 
of it -- was liberated," Winston S. Churchill told a joint meeting of Congress 
convened as part of a yearlong celebration marking the centennial of 
Eisenhower's birth on Oct. 14, 1890. 
</P>
<P>
"How thrilled he and Churchill would be today, to see the peoples of Eastern 
Europe at last emerging as free nations from a nightmare of 50 years' 
occupation, first under the Nazis, then the Soviet Red Army," Churchill said. 
</P>
<P>
"He will forever be revered among those nations who, like my own, were his 
comrades-in-arms and remembered with abiding gratitude by those nations which 
were liberated, under his command, from the most monstrous and vile tyranny 
that has ever defiled this Earth," Churchill said. 
</P>
<P>
John S. D. Eisenhower, son of the Republican President who served from 1953 to 
1961, said, "I believe he would like to be thought of simply as the Good 
Soldier." 
</P>
<P>
"He walked with kings but never forgot his home in Abilene, Kansas," Eisenhower 
said. "He was the vaunted warrior who hated war. He was the five-star general 
who warned of the dangers of an unbridled military-industrial complex." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Cronkite, retired CBS television news anchor, saluted Eisenhower as "the 
greatest hero of the greatest war in history." 
</P>
<P>
Members of Eisenhower's family, including several great-grandchildren, and 
surviving members of his Administration joined senators and representatives in 
the chamber. Many wore red, white and blue "I Like Ike" buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower was born in Denison, Tex. When he was less than a year old, the 
family moved to Abilene, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
The Dwight David Eisenhower Centennial Commission, established by Congress to 
observe the 100th anniversary, has planned observances throughout the year, 
including a celebration in Abilene on Eisenhower's birthday.

A crowded ferry boat capsized when passengers scrambled to save a child who 
fell overboard, and at least 47 people drowned, news reports said today. 
Fifty-six others were missing. 
</P>
<P>
The privately owned boat was carrying 153 people back from Myanmar (formerly 
Burma) after a day's trip when it sank Monday during high tide in the Naff 
River in southern Bangladesh, the United News of Bangladesh reported. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted survivors as saying the ferry swayed and sank after 
passengers hurried to rescue a child who fell into the river from the boat. The 
child was among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dead were 24 women and five children. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted local officials as saying the final death toll will be 
higher because many of the missing are presumed dead.

7 STATES FIGHT U.S. NATIONAL GUARD ORDERS

<P>
Governors were attempting to intervene in foreign policy when they tried to 
stop their National Guard units from training in Central America, the Bush 
Administration argued today before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr urged the justices to uphold a 1986 law that 
stripped governors of their veto power over National Guard training missions. 
</P>
<P>
But a Minnesota official said the Founding Fathers feared a large standing army 
and believed state control could serve as a check on the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, who objected to his state's National Guard being 
sent to Honduras, contends in a lawsuit against the Defense Department that 
states have the constitutional authority to direct or consent to peacetime 
training of their state militia. 
</P>
<P>
But, "what the governor has sought to do is to play a role in the foreign 
policy and defense policy of the United States," Starr said in oral arguments 
before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Perpich says the issue is one of states' rights rather than foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Founding Fathers "greatly feared the effect of a large standing army," said 
John Tunheim, chief deputy attorney general for Minnesota. "They believed that 
state control would be a very important check on the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 law, known as the Montgomery Amendment, barred governors from stopping 
a National Guard unit from serving on active duty outside the country because 
they don't like the location, purpose or schedule of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Named for Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), the law was enacted after 
several governors said they opposed the Reagan Administration's Central 
American policy and did not want National Guard troops assigned to train in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law last June, saying that the 
state's power to organize militias "cannot constrain Congress' authority to 
train the guard as it sees fit." 
</P>
<P>
Since members of the National Guard are enlisted in the U.S. armed forces as 
well as a state government, the President can order them to train anywhere he 
sees fit, Starr argued. 
</P>
<P>
"They wear two hats. When they were going to Honduras, they were wearing their 
federal hat," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy questioned how the federal government could properly 
prepare National Guard units for battle without deciding where to train them. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine states filed a brief siding with the Administration, saying that 
Perpich was "seeking to arrogate to himself a role in foreign affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Six other states -- Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Ohio and Vermont -- 
took Minnesota's side, arguing that the Founding Fathers wanted state control 
of the militia to prevent abuses by the federal government.

The husband of actress Kathleen Turner is one of the landlords of the illegal 
social club where arson killed 87 people, his lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Boyle said in a statement that Jay Weiss and a partner, Morris Jaffe, 
principals of Little Peach Realty Inc., leased the Bronx site in 1985 from 
Clarendon Place, a corporation controlled by Alex DiLorenzo III. 
</P>
<P>
Little Peach sublet the property in 1987 to Elias Colon, who operated the Happy 
Land social club and was one of the 87 who died there early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle added that Little Peach had been trying to evict Colon and that an 
eviction trial was scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bronx Dist. Atty. Robert Johnson has said his staff is working on sorting out 
the ownership of the building and looking into whether anyone in the corporate 
chain bears criminal liability in the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Turner and Weiss married in August, 1984, after a romance that started when he 
helped her find a Manhattan apartment.

O. Stillman Rockefeller, 30-year-old heir to the Rockefeller and Carnegie 
fortunes, today was flown back to New York City for treatment of shark bites he 
suffered off a Fiji island owned by the estate of the late publisher Malcolm 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
The son of former banker James S. Rockefeller and his wife, the former Nancy 
Carnegie of the steel family, returned to the United States accompanied by a 
medical team, according to a spokesman for Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
He was being treated at a New York area hospital. His condition was not 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller was guest on Forbes-owned Laucala Island resort when the shark 
attack occurred Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller, one of America's most eligible bachelors, belongs to the 
Greenwich, Conn., branch of the Rockefeller family established by William 
Rockefeller, brother of the original John D. Rockefeller of oil empire fame. 
</P>
<P>
He is a second cousin of Michael Rockefeller, son of late Vice President Nelson 
A. Rockefeller, who disappeared in Papua New Guinea in 1961. His fate remains a 
mystery but it was widely believed at the time that he was eaten by crocodiles.

New York's budget woes took a dramatic turn for the worse as Wall Street's two 
major rating agencies lowered the state's credit rating, leaving it with the 
third worst rating among the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's credit downgradings could cost New York taxpayers millions of dollars 
in higher interest payments on the state's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Only Massachusetts and Louisiana are rated as worse credit risks than New York. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has put blame for the state's third straight year of fiscal 
problems on an unanticipated drop in tax revenues and the economic slowdown 
that has hit the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
The state's budget deficit for fiscal 1990, which ends Saturday, is projected 
at more than $1 billion. A $1.5-billion shortfall forecast for fiscal 1991 
"continues to grow," Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said in announcing its 
downgrade.

British luxury carmaker Jaguar announced today that chairman Sir John Egan will 
retire from the company at the end of June to pave the way for expansion under 
its new owner, the Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
Egan, 50, has spent the last 10 years at the head of Jaguar, turning the 
company around after a bumpy ride in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
A Jaguar statement quoted him as saying: "My advice to Ford was that the big 
growth opportunities available to Jaguar under their ownership could only be 
fully exploited if the company was led by a senior Ford executive." 
</P>
<P>
It said he is to be succeeded July 1 by fellow Briton William Hayden, appointed 
today as Jaguar's chief executive. Hayden, 61, has been vice president of Ford 
of Europe's Manufacturing Group for the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. automotive giant bought Jaguar for 1.6 billion ($2.6 billion) in 
December after unfavorable exchange rates and poor North American sales caused 
profits to plunge.

BAT Industries PLC said today it will sell its 18 John Breuner Co. furniture 
stores to Prism Capital Corp., a merchant bank in New York, for $92.5 million 
in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is to be completed in about two months through BATUS Inc., the U.S. 
subsidiary of BAT, the conglomerate said. 
</P>
<P>
Breuners, which is based in San Ramon, Calif., was bought by BAT in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is one step in BAT's strategy of focusing on its tobacco and financial 
services businesses to fight off a 13.4-billion, or $22-billion, hostile 
takeover offer from Hoylake Investments Ltd., an investor group led by 
Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Part of this restructuring includes the sale of all BAT's retail operations in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The others to be sold include Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's, Ivey's and 
Breuners' furniture rental business. The conglomerate said it hopes to have all 
the sales completed by the middle of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Prism also owns a controlling interest in Barker Bros. Co., a chain of 11 
high-quality furniture stores in Southern California.

Jewelers Kutchinsky, whose audacious creations are de rigueur in some jet set

<P>
The two-foot-high egg, made from 37 pounds of gold and studded with 20,000 pink 
diamonds, will go on sale for $11.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
"So far as we know, it is the biggest decorative egg of its kind in the world 
and contains the largest single collection of rare pink diamonds in any one 
piece," said designer Paul Kutchinsky. 
</P>
<P>
The egg opens electronically to reveal a miniature library with cabinets and 
books. A carousel then revolves to display a tiny portrait gallery where the 
eventual owners could feature their family. 
</P>
<P>
The egg will be unveiled on April 11, just before Easter, in London before 
being shown in Tokyo and New York.

AMEX SWEETENS OFFER FOR SHEARSON BUYOUT

American Express Co. today sweetened its purchase of outstanding shares of 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and said it will give its struggling securities 
unit $750 million in capital as previously announced. 
</P>
<P>
The moves came amid reports that Shearson, the second-largest Wall Street firm, 
is planning a first-quarter charge against earnings of more than $700 million, 
which would be the largest ever in the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
American Express said each publicly held Shearson share will be converted into 
0.48 of a share of American Express stock. That will be a 12.7% increase from 
the 0.426 a share announced earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The deal marks a reversal for American Express, which had planned to reduce its 
majority stake in the Wall Street firm that is struggling because of 
overexpansion and a recession in the securities industry. When completed, 
American Express will own about 92% of Shearson. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved late Monday by Shearson's board on the recommendation of 
a special committee of Shearson directors and the American Express board. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson stock jumped $1.12 1/2 to $12.37 1/2 in early New York Stock Exchange 
trading today. American Express fell 50 cents to $26.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shearson is expected to take a 
charge against earnings of $700 million to $800 million in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The charge would cover severance payments for about 2,000 laid-off workers, the 
cost of closing about 50 branch offices, reserves against losses at Shearson's 
Balcor Co. real estate unit and lease payments for businesses Shearson plans to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson and American Express said in a joint statement that attorneys for 
shareholders had agreed to drop class-action suits challenging the merger, 
pending court approval. 
</P>
<P>
The suits claimed that American Express was offering too little for the 
Shearson stock, which it had sold at $34 a share in an initial public offering 
in 1987.

CIRCLE K POSTS LOSS, SEEKS TO RESTRUCTURE DEBT OF $1.17 BILLION

In another sign of woes in the retailing industry, Circle K Corp., the nation's 
second-largest operator of convenience stores, said today it is trying to 
renegotiate its debt to combat an expected liquidity crunch. Circle K said it 
believes a negotiated restructuring, although hard 
</P>
<P>
to achieve, can be successfully completed without filing for bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix-based retailer's current debt load is $1.17 billion, most of which 
is in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, said Circle K spokesman Ray Cox. 
</P>
<P>
"If the company does not achieve a financial restructuring, it will not have 
adequate liquidity," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Circle K also reported a loss for the fiscal third quarter ended Jan. 31 of 
$28.1 million on revenues of $872.5 million, compared with profit of $12.8 
million on revenues of $895.2 million a year earlier. The year-ago earnings 
included a $14.4 million gain on the sale of certain operations. 
</P>
<P>
It said its sales have been hurt by intensified competition from gasoline 
companies' expansion of their convenience store operations and from 
supermarkets competing more aggressively for convenience-oriented customers. 
</P>
<P>
The company, second in size only to the troubled owner of 7-Eleven convenience 
stores Southland Corp., said its earnings continue to be hurt by high interest 
and depreciation costs from acquisitions and expansion, and by heated 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
It said it has reviewed its marketing policies and is cutting prices in several 
key product areas in an attempt to boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
Circle K has more than 4,650 stores in 33 states in the South, West and New 
England and licenses another 1,250 stores in 11 foreign countries operating 
under the Circle K name. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the company has been struggling to cut costs, reduce 
inventory, change management and try different pricing strategies in an effort 
to come up with a winning money-making formula. 
</P>
<P>
Circle K said it had to cancel the payment of certain cash dividends. All of 
its preferred stock is owned by affiliates of its largest shareholder, American 
Financial Corp., which has been advancing Circle K cash. 
</P>
<P>
It said for its fiscal third quarter, it was in technical default of its bank 
lending agreements but the noncompliance has been waived until April 6, when a 
$60 million portion of the borrowing is owed. Circle K said it will seek an 
extension of that waiver until the completion of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it is required to repurchase on April 16 $20 million of its 
$180 million of outstanding senior secured debt because of its failure to meet 
interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
Circle K said it is seeking modification of the senior debt agreements.

STARS FAN OUT TO GLITTERY PARTIES AFTER

<P>
After watching the Motion Picture Academy dole out awards for 3 1/2 hours, 
Hollywood's stars fanned out from the downtown Music Center to glittery parties 
thronged by hordes of fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it a good show? You can never tell when you're there," said Anjelica 
Huston at a bash at the Mondrian Hotel Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Huston wandered around the palm-tree-lined patio with the likes of Rob Lowe, 
Dudley Moore, Billy Crystal, Christina Applegate and former California Gov. 
Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone, winner of the best director Oscar for "Born on the Fourth of 
July," was mobbed in the lobby by autograph-seeking fans. He posed briefly for 
pictures with Crystal and was hustled into an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks up Sunset Boulevard, hundreds of squealing fans cheered a 
procession of limousines dropping off passengers at the prestigious Spago party 
put on by literary agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar. Inside, guests dined on 
Wolfgang Puck's famous pizza and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
Back downtown, the prestigious Board of Governors Ball took on the festive 
atmosphere of what it must have been like when the Academy Awards were 
celebrated in ballrooms at local hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Music Center patrons had only to move a few yards into a huge white tent with 
oversized balloons at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Winners and losers congregated around the dance floor and congratulated and 
commiserated with each other in a communal spirit rarely seen in today's 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson, who handed out the best picture award to 
"Driving Miss Daisy," checked out the scene and chatted with friends like 
Jessica Lange and Daryl Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
Best actress winner Jessica Tandy and her husband of 47 years, Hume Cronyn, 
accepted congratulations at their table while Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and 
Danny Aiello represented the New York crowd in their own corner. 
</P>
<P>
"Mighty good show," commented past Oscar winner Gregory Peck, who presented the 
best actress award to Miss Tandy for her starring role in "Driving Miss Daisy."

<P>
Oscar-winning film director Oliver Stone has apologized for wrongly depicting 
Syracuse police clubbing college protesters in his movie "Born on the Fourth of 
July." 
</P>
<P>
Stone apologized in a letter that was sent to the Syracuse Police Benevolent 
Assn. and addressed to all city residents. 
</P>
<P>
The film won two Oscars at the Academy Awards on Monday night, including one 
for Stone for best director. 
</P>
<P>
"I took creative license to make my point and sometimes sacrificed smaller 
truths for larger ones," Stone wrote. "There is, I would like to point out, a 
disclaimer at the end of the film to this effect." 
</P>
<P>
The movie, starring Tom Cruise, is based on the life story of Ron Kovic, and 
his passage from patriotic soldier to anti-war activist. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a book by Kovic, the movie depicts city police officers beating 
students during a campus protest at Syracuse University in 1970. City police 
officials denied that officers used violence to stop college protests.

Some movie stars stayed clear of Hollywood on Academy Awards night. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Reeve, Susan Sarandon, Ron Silver, Jennifer Beales and Alec 
Baldwin, all members of The Creative Coalition, met with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo 
and state legislators Monday to promote environmental bills. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sometimes there's a skeptical attitude about celebrities, that we just 
do quick hits," Reeve said. "We are a serious group." 
</P>
<P>
The politically active artists' group has pledged to exploit its celebrity 
status to promote legislation in New York state that aims to protect the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"State government has become more powerful as the federal government has 
withdrawn from matters of concern to the people of the state and the nation," 
said Silver, the organization's president. 
</P>
<P>
The group supports Cuomo's proposed $1.9-billion environmental bond act, and 
will identify lawmakers who try to block pro-environment bills, Silver said.

Fight promoter Don King denies he tried to stir up racial tensions by visiting 
the hometown of heavyweight champion James (Buster) Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
King appealed to City Council President Jerry Hammond on Monday night to pass 
along a statement by King that he did not go to Columbus to create trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"They (King and his entourage) were concerned they were being portrayed as 
divisive in the community," Hammond said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
King arrived in Columbus last week, saying he planned to attend the 50th 
birthday celebration of Douglas' father, James. The visit fueled local 
speculation about King's motives. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Douglas called a news conference to deny that there was a rift 
between him and his manager, John Johnson. King reportedly had said on a local 
radio talk show that there was a rift between Douglas, who is black, and 
Johnson, who is white.

Suspensions handed to Coach Rick Kozuback and two players on the Tri-City 
Americans will continue indefinitely, the president of the Western Hockey 
League said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Chynoweth said a decision on further penalties against Kozuback, Terry 
Virtue and Jeff Fancy might be made later in the day after league Vice 
President Rick Doerksen meets with Kozuback in Kennewick, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"The three were suspended indefinitely, and the suspension is not going to end 
before tonight's game, I'll tell you," Chynoweth said in a telephone interview 
from the league's head office. "We feel Rick Kozuback should be entitled to 
give his side of the story. Once that's been done, we'll have a decision. It 
could come later today but (Wednesday) at the latest." 
</P>
<P>
Kozuback, Virtue and Fancy were suspended after members of the Americans went 
after fans in the stands during a West Division best-of-nine semifinal playoff 
series in Seattle against the Thunderbirds.

Jaime Jarrin, the Spanish-language voice of the Dodgers for 31 years, was 
hospitalized in fair condition today after an automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin, 56, was in the intensive care unit with several internal injuries, said 
Judy Peirce, spokeswoman for Indian River Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin calls play-by-play on KWKW in Los Angeles, the flagship of the Dodgers'

</P>
<P>
He has covered the team since 1959 and became the No. 1 man in the booth in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin was injured Monday night in an accident on U.S. 1 in Vero Beach, the 
team said. He suffered a laceration of his liver, a ruptured spleen and 
fractured ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. W. Clark Beckett operated on the sportscaster early today to repair his 
liver and remove the spleen.

<P>
For the four college basketball teams that survived the far-flung and grueling 
NCAA regional tournaments, the road stops here, and the city hopes the bucks -- 
up to 25 million of them -- stop here too. 
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic projections by the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce and 
the Denver Organizing Committee are that the 20,000 fans, players, coaches, 
reporters and tourists will spend $25 million when the Final Four Basketball 
Tournament comes to town Saturday through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most pessimistic prediction, from the International Assn. of 
Convention and Visitors Bureaus, estimates that at least $17 million will be 
infused into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the biggest hotel weekend in the eight years I've been doing 
business here," said Harold Levin, general manager of the Executive Tower Inn 
in downtown Denver. "These people aren't ordinary consumers. They're not 
rate-conscious like a lot of people who come in for conventions. They'll spend 
more money than any other group in a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
Organizing committee officials say nearly 90% of downtown Denver's 16,000 hotel 
rooms are booked for the tournament. Usually at this time of year hotels are 
only half full. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of the tournament, hotels will pull in about $12 million, the 
organizing committee said. Cabs, limousines, buses and rental cars could 
receive as much as $1.4 million and retail sales along the 16th Street Mall 
could jump as much as 20%. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, supported by an army of volunteers -- most of whom won't get to 
see any of the basketball action -- are doing their best to make sure the 
visitors get a good impression of the Mile High City. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers range from a former U.S. President, Gerald R. Ford, to high 
school students. Ford is one of several honorary committeemen, along with Gov. 
Roy Romer, Denver Mayor Federico Pena and University of Colorado President 
Gordon Gee. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament games will be held at McNichols Arena, which holds about 17,000 
fans. This year's tournament will be the last NCAA Final Four tournament to be 
held in a small arena for a while. Next year's March Madness will be held in 
the Hoosierdome in Indianapolis, and New Orleans will play host in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Three conventions also will be in town: the National Assn. of Basketball 
Coaches, the National Assn. of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and the U.S. 
Basketball Writers Assn.

UMPIRES RETURN TO WORK FRIDAY AS TALKS PROCEED

<P>
Umpires today agreed to return to work on Friday for spring training games 
while pay and other related issues are resolved through binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Norma L. Shapiro announced the agreement between baseball 
and union officials in open court after closed-door sessions that began this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said she appointed retired Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Stanley 
Greenburg to handle the arbitration on pay and scheduling questions as well as 
hotel deposits and airline tickets lost by the umpires when season plans 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
The umpires boycotted spring training games, which began Monday, to protest the 
way regular season games were rescheduled after the 32-day player lockout 
ended. The umpires said they should have had a say in the process. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, baseball officials asked Shapiro for a restraining order to force 
the umpires back to work. Minor league umpires have been working the exhibition 
games. The boycotting umpires said they would have reported for regular season 
games, which begin April 9. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro was to hear arguments beginning this morning, but lawyers asked that 
the hearing be delayed while they tried to work out an agreement. Shapiro 
recessed closed-door sessions for lunch and said "considerable progress" was 
being made. 
</P>
<P>
National League President Bill White and American League President Bobby Brown 
were on hand for the morning session. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking the restraining order, baseball officials said the umpires violated 
no-strike and grievance clauses in their contract. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said the leagues' collective bargaining agreement with the 
umpires, in effect through Dec. 31, contains mandatory grievance and 
arbitration procedures for settling disputes between the parties.

A TWISTED TRAIL TO TRIPLE CROWN

<P>
The progression of 3-year-olds toward the Triple Crown is beginning to look 
like a chess match as Eastern stables disperse from Florida and West Coast 
horsemen begin to look east in search of the best, least-taxing route to 
Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-increasing number of options available to trainers preparing horses 
for the Triple Crown demands that they jockey for position. The road to the 
Derby meanders hither and yon these days. It has even brought a brand-name, if 
slightly off-course, colt to Turfway Park in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall's winter was marked alarmingly by a pulmonary bleeding episode in 
a workout at Gulfstream. It sharply set back his training and delayed his 
return to competition until March 17, when he ran a strong second to the very 
fast sprinter Housebuster in the 7-furlong Swale Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Justifiably encouraged by the effort, trainer Neil Howard is bound for 
Saturday's $500,000 Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway, in which Summer Squall will 
face two turns and 9 furlongs for the first time. Howard has chosen the 
Beam-Blue Grass course to Louisville for the Dogwood Stable colt, and that may 
be the path of least resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Yonder will start in the Beam, but he has not raced since his disappointing 
performance in the Fountain of Youth Stakes and may not, even at his best, be 
up to a sharp Summer Squall. Shot Gun Scott, surprise winner of the Fountain of 
Youth, is also in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, a handful of local horses and a California shipper or two trying to 
avoid Mister Frisky will flesh out the Beam. 
</P>
<P>
If Howard is attempting to avoid as much stress as possible en route to the 
Kentucky Derby, Howie Tesher, who trains the undefeated New York-bred 
Champagneforashley, is turning it into an art form. 
</P>
<P>
Tesher waited until March 18 and sent Champagneforashley from Gulfstream Park 
to Tampa Bay Downs for his first start of the season. The spot he chose was 
more difficult than anyone anticipated, and Champagneforashley's prerace 
misbehavior only complicated matters, but the colt remained undefeated with a 
remarkable, if taxing, effort. A bout with colic followed, understandable 
considering the stress of his first race since December. 
</P>
<P>
After the Tampa Bay Derby, Tesher said that he was considering either the April 
7 Preview Stakes at Gulfstream or the Gotham at Aqueduct the same day, then the 
April 21 Wood Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he eliminated the Preview as an option and on Monday Tesher announced 
that Champagneforashley will make his next start not in the Gotham, but in the 
April 13 DeWitt Clinton Handicap, which is restricted to New York-breds and run 
at 7 furlongs. Tesher will saddle Champagneforashley eight days later for the 
Wood Memorial, then move on to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
The focus in the West is a good deal sharper. Mister Frisky -- undefeated, 
untied and unscored upon in 15 races in Puerto Rico and California -- is going 
to the April 7 Santa Anita Derby. Tarascon, who finished second to Mister 
Frisky in the San Vicente, then won the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn, remains in 
Arkansas. Burnt Hills, who defeated the since-injured Grand Canyon in July in a 
maiden race at Hollywood Park and won the Bolsa Chica Stakes in February, is 
going to New York for the Gotham. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no competition in California for Mister Frisky in his two races 
this winter, and there appears to be little forthcoming. If he stays 9 furlongs 
in the Santa Anita Derby and does not begin to show the strain of having run in 
16 races in the last 12 months, he will arrive in Louisville as a formidable 
favorite to win the Derby.

Rest easy, folks. Whatever you might have supposed, baseball is the same as it 
ever was. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, at Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium, that's a mixed blessing. The crack of 
the bat was muffled by the roar of planes flying overhead, and the elevator was 
in mid-season form, briefly trapping one unfortunate. There was a fire sighted 
somewhere in the distance, a dark cloud befouling the blue skies, and it seemed 
just like home. 
</P>
<P>
Only 1,959 hardy souls braved the 80-degree temperatures (it was slightly 
overcast) for the Baltimore Orioles' spring opener. The small crowd was almost 
certainly less a statement on the recent labor strife than it was one more 
reason why the Orioles would rather be playing their spring games elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to begin, the Orioles played two Monday, starting with a "B" game, 
featuring mostly minor leaguers. In the fourth inning of the first game, 
Orioles Manager Frank Robinson leaned over from the dugout to pronounce his 
team "unbeaten and unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, they lost both games, by identical 5-3 scores. Not that it 
mattered. Spring games are public rehearsals that don't merit serious review. 
The idea is to learn your lines. 
</P>
<P>
For Phil Bradley, it is the 10th such rehearsal, but this one differs 
significantly from the others. He prepared himself for the 1990 baseball season 
by sitting through labor negotiations in the face of a lockout, arguing the 
players' cause, helping to sort out an agreement that took longer than anyone 
should have guessed. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to be patient," Bradley was saying Monday, "but I didn't 
understand what they meant. Now I do." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the same kind of patience demanded of a batter facing a breaking-ball 
pitcher. Lawyers understand this kind of patience, wherein delay is a weapon 
and obfuscation is the name of the game. If you ask Bradley what he did in his 
off-season, he'll tell you he learned a whole new ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
First, he volunteered to be elected to serve on the executive board of the 
players' association, knowing full well that it meant he'd have to become a 
labor negotiator, for good and ill. He said that the choice wasn't as difficult 
as it might seem. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to know what's going on," he said. "The only way you could know was to 
be a part of it. From early December, I was involved in almost every 
negotiation that took place. I was in L.A. and I was in Tampa. I must have made 
eight or 10 trips to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The frustrating part was that so many of the issues seemed so direct, but they 
were never dealt with directly. Eventually, I figured out this thing wasn't 
going to end until the owners wanted it to end, no matter what I did. When I 
understood that, it took a lot of pressure off me. They were the ones who were 
going to decide when we were going to get things resolved." 
</P>
<P>
And so, Bradley was involved, up to his numbers. He's that kind of person 
anyway, one who takes life a little more seriously than the rest of us do. If 
you were a member of a union, he's just the person you'd want negotiating on 
your side. 
</P>
<P>
For a ballplayer, though, there is a downside to that degree of involvement. 
</P>
<P>
For today's player, at least for those players who don't have to drive a truck 
to support themselves, the off-season is a time to prepare for the on-season. 
Players take better care of themselves than they used to in the supposed good 
old days, when the only wintertime conditioning in which your average player 
partook was to pay someone to shovel the snow off the walk. Today, a player 
comes to camp in shape. He has stretched out his arm and probably taken some 
swings in a batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until March, I was working out three times a week," Bradley said. "After 
that, I didn't get as much work in. Am I behind? I don't know. I feel good. I 
know I haven't had a good start since 1985, no matter what I've done over the 
winter. I told myself when I got involved in this that I wasn't going to blame 
a slow start on the negotiations. If I did that, how was I going to explain the 
other years?" 
</P>
<P>
Last year was not everything Bradley wanted it to be. Although it was the first 
year in six big-league seasons he had played on a team to have won more than 
half its games, he hit only .277 -- 16 points below his lifetime average. A big 
second-half hitter for all his career, Bradley slumped after the All-Star 
break, and he may have been pressing during his first pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
For this season, he has changed the number of his uniform from 16 to 1, and 
maybe that will help. But he wouldn't change anything about his role as a labor 
negotiator, except its duration. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want me to do it again the next time, I'd be happy to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there was baseball to be played. Bradley, batting leadoff in 
Monday's spring opener, had a single and a walk and reached base on an error in 
three trips to the plate. It didn't seem so bad, and the best part was nobody 
tried to talk him out of it.
