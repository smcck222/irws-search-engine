SCHABARUM WON'T RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County supervisors claim they can't afford to build roads or parks, but are 
going to be spending more than $5 million to defend a plan to keep themselves 
in office at the expense of Latinos and other county residents ("Latinos Urge 
Board to Settle Remap Suit With New District," Part B, March 14). When will the 
voters realize that their five elected representatives don't belong in office, 
they belong in jail.

SCHABARUM WON'T RUN

<TEXT>
<P>
I have known Sarah Flores for the last 10 years and have been quite impressed 
with the devotion and loyalty she had for Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
It is quite all right for Schabarum to endorse whomever he wants to succeed 
him. But it was so sickening of him to be so unkind to Flores who has been such 
a loyal and trusted secretary and deputy for 18 years ("Schabarum Snubs Aide 
and Backs Judge as His Successor," Part B, March 16). 
</P>
<P>
It will be interesting to note how Schabarum could attract loyal friends and 
associates in his future endeavors in Southern California.

HOW HARD TO PUSH GORBACHEV?; 
</P>
<P>
A VALIANT LITHUANIA LOOKS TO GO FOR BROKE: HOW WISE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in the Lithuanian crisis, President Bush sensibly appealed to Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev not to use force to keep the tiny Baltic nation 
in line and urged the leaders to talk over their problem. Then he tossed off 
one of his customary enigmatic lines: "There are certain realities in life," he 
said. "The Lithuanians are well aware of them." 
</P>
<P>
The White House, which wisely has kept a low profile on Lithuania this week by 
trying to avoid making a bad situation worse, did not get into details about 
those realities. But as the days drag by and the Soviet military presence is 
increasingly intimidating and more blood is actually spilled, two realities are 
now painfully clear. 
</P>
<P>
One is that Lithuania is free to ask whether it wants to stay on its present 
collision course. Another is that Gorbachev has no such freedom. 
</P>
<P>
He walked the streets of Vilnius in January, collaring Lithuanians and trying 
to talk them out of seceding from the Soviet Union. Not only did he fail in 
that, but he failed to sense their desperation to be out from under the 
Kremlin's thumb. He lost control so completely that after their Parliament 
declared itself no longer a part of the empire, Lithuanians began deserting the 
Soviet army, a point at which all armies usually draw the line. Under pressure 
from the army, political hard-liners and general concern in Moscow about chaos, 
Gorbachev began trying to achieve by a show of force what he failed to get by 
pressing the flesh in the streets of Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has a very serious problem. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, symbol of 
Poland's new-found freedom, joined other European leaders Tuesday in appealing 
to Gorbachev to pull back his troops and join Lithuanians in a search for a 
political solution. Bush has called for much the same thing. Fine, but moral 
support is the extent of what Lithuania can expect from the West. No nation 
will move to free Lithuania by force. What the United States ought not do is to 
create greater difficulty or to raise false hopes among the Lithuanians, who, 
in the end, are the ones who would be most hurt by bombastic and cruelly 
misleading American rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
It's understandable that Lithuania feels that its freedom is an all-or-nothing, 
now-or-never proposition. But is it being realistic? North along the Baltic 
coastline, Estonia has weighed its own hopes of achieving the same goal as 
Lithuania and concluded that its best chance is to move slowly. The southern 
Soviet Republic of Georgia has put its own prospects for freedom from Moscow on 
hold. These may represent two more realities of life. And much the more 
pragmatic approach.

The city that nobody loves? 
</P>
<P>
Balderdash. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. has no defenders? 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
What is wrong with Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Not much. 
</P>
<P>
I am here as one defender. I will stand up for L.A. pimples, carbuncles and 
all. 
</P>
<P>
I have a feeling Robert A. Jones has been living in and writing about some 
other city ("The City That Nobody Loves to Love," Part A, March 20). 
</P>
<P>
I have been here since 1934, so I have seen the changes, some bad, many of the 
absolutely fine. 
</P>
<P>
But first off, let me ask Mr. Jones, has he been to Detroit, Chicago or New 
York lately? Has he taken a taxi from Kennedy airport through the ghettos on 
the way to downtown Manhattan? Has he seen the Third World in Philadelphia? 
What about Washington, D.C., an island of pure white marble surrounded by 
dumps? 
</P>
<P>
Our slums are Disneyland by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Not that we don't have much to do. Hollywood needs to be razed and rebuilt. 
Little Tokyo has to be integrated by a bright pathway of small shops and lights 
to Olvera Street and Chinatown; let's do it! The freeways, one of our biggest 
problems, need to be red-and blue-license plated. Red licensed cars to drive 
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, blue licenses Tuesdays, Thursdays and 
Saturdays. Sundays? Let everyone. The red and blue license scheme would force 
loners to take one extra passenger per trip, every other day. If we are going 
to put with this Attractive Nuisance, which is what a freeway is, let's run it 
better than Mussolini's railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation? If we reduced all bus fares to a quarter or 50 cents, as we did 
10 years ago, we would have 500,000 more riders per day. How many cars would 
that take off the streets? When the Long Beach light rail rolls toward L.A. the 
fare they will be asking is a buck-twenty-five. Too much. They predict 20,000 
riders a day. Not enough. Keep the fare down to 50 cents and you'd get 40,000 
or 50,000 riders. Either way, you make roughly the same amount at the fare box. 
</P>
<P>
While we're waiting for the subway to turn north at Fairfax and die in bagel 
territory, how about all those monorail lines we spoke of 28 years ago? For the 
price of one dim-bulb subway, we could build 12 monorail lines and have them up 
in a few years rather than 10 or 12 or 15. 
</P>
<P>
Those are most of our problems. Those are the solutions. 
</P>
<P>
As for feeling alienated by L.A. Everyone knows that cities are people. Paris 
is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but if you're there alone, 
forget it. Rome, London, New York, are desolate without friends. When our best 
friends die, part of the city they lived in dies with them. New friends in far 
places relight the lamps, redecorate the tables and improve the wine. 
</P>
<P>
I can only suggest to Mr. Jones and anyone who feels as he does, he has not 
made a proper, gentle and loving search for the amiable conversation, the 
garden decorated with one or two men or women, which is all we need in any one 
town to shift the weather from eternal twilight to our own always summertime 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
And along the way, remember, when I got here in Los Angeles in 1934 there was 
no Music Center, no theater, no art. Since then, more than 9 theaters have 
proliferated, and our musical and dramatic Athens is on the hill. Art 
galleries? What's the count as of this year? 100? 150? Some one tell me the 
figures. They're there. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, I do not make a mindless defense of my beloved L.A. I am ready with 
the criticism, the spot-remover, the transportation, freeway, and city plans. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. is superb. I was allowed to grow and create here without being mobbed and 
beaten up by the New York, Paris or London hierarchies of snobs and pedants. 
</P>
<P>
And as I have said often before, L.A.? Is 80 oranges (towns) in search of a 
navel. I hope we never find it. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, Bobby Jones, meet me at Farmer's Market some noon. I'll be your friend. 
L.A. might not improve right off. But it'll give you hope.

RECHY ON ROONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Novelist John Rechy discovered that Andy Rooney, after making his apologies on 
CBS' "60 Minutes" for some loony remarks about gays and blacks, had sustained 
more popularity than President Bush (Op-Ed Page, March 9). So, the USC lecturer 
then set out to prove that Rooney was really a bigot after all, albeit a nice 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The current trend with such matters is that unless you hold solely to a 
politically correct view on race, homosexuality, women's rights, etc., you 
become open to yet another powerful victims lobby and in Rooney's case, 
considerable persecution and nearly the loss of his job. It's thought control 
and repression of the 1950s revisited, only this time perpetrated by many 
college professors and universities. Rooney found out that the only way 
subjects of race or homosexuality can be discussed is through bland inane 
pieties that do little to advance knowledge or understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Rechy makes some missteps of his own. For his purposes, he prefers that the 
option, if you will, of deciding whether you are "straight" or homosexual is 
much like deciding whether you're going to be a Republican or a Democrat. Then 
he corrupts Rooney's positive affirmation of his culture and his life's 
preferences that flow from that as a statement of bigotry with moral 
equivalents about Nazis and white supremacists. How thoughtful! Rooney like 
Rechy added little to the dialogue, but in this instance Rechy made victims of 
us all.

DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Barbarism in Iraq" (March 16) is excellent. Summary execution 
of a journalist is certainly barbaric. However, we need to think about its 
meaning in our own context. 
</P>
<P>
How much worse is their action than are ours? The United States is almost the 
only country in the industrialized world that still has the death penalty. Over 
the years we have executed many innocent people. Far more blacks and other 
minorities than whites receive the death penalty. Thus, the death penalty is in 
fact a form of racial hatred. Executions serve no practical purpose. The data 
shows that executions do not decrease the murder rate. 
</P>
<P>
Soon our state will perform the first execution in many years. That will be a 
dark day for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord." Why do we subvert our religious heritage 
by retaining useless capital punishment?

LITHUANIA A CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE;

<P>
BALTIC FREEDOM NEEDN'T MAKE THE DOMINOES FALL; 
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW COULD LET ALL THREE BALTIC STATES GO WITHOUT UNLEASHING AN EXODUS FROM 
OTHER REPUBLICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There never has been reason for confidence that the Soviet Union would let 
Lithuania secede. There has always been cause to ask if it can let Lithuania 
go. The war of nerves against Lithuania these last few days probably reflects 
indecision and conflict within the Soviet government itself. The choice that 
government finally makes may prove the most important international event since 
reform began in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow understands that if Lithuania secedes, Estonia and Latvia would rapidly 
follow. Disintegrative forces elsewhere would be reinforced. Voters in the 
Ukraine on Sunday gave unexpectedly strong support to republican parliament 
candidates committed to full independence. The Soviet Army seized Lithuanian 
deserters this week because there soon would be no army if servicemen from the 
republics experiencing autonomist agitation were permitted to leave at will. 
Politicians and soldiers nonetheless see that military intervention to prevent 
Lithuania's secession would carry devastating costs. 
</P>
<P>
This is a turning point for Soviet reform, and there is one thing Western 
governments could do that might make a constructive difference: They could 
reemphasize to Moscow that they recognize a crucial distinction between the 
situation of the Baltic republics and that of the other potentially 
secessionist republics and communities. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin's incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union at the start 
of World War II has never been recognized by the principal Western governments. 
The United States still accords diplomatic recognition to residual elements of 
the prewar republics. France does not recognize the three as legally part of 
the Soviet Union. Britain accords only de facto recognition. 
</P>
<P>
It is different for the Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldavia and the other 
Soviet republics where autonomist movements have sprung up. Each has a 
complicated relationship with Russia, but none is considered by the Western 
governments as other than a legitimate component of the Soviet Union. Whether 
that status follows from World War II settlement, the civil war that followed 
the 1917 Revolution, or czarist imperial expansion, it is uncontested by the 
Western governments. Secessionist movements in those republics are Soviet 
internal matters. 
</P>
<P>
While the West has supported Baltic independence since the three republics were 
formed in the 1920s, it is not the policy of the Western governments to support 
or advocate the break-up of the Soviet Union itself. In Western eyes, Soviet 
recognition of the Baltics' independence would not establish a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Precedence is the reason the Balts have presented so terrible a problem to the 
Soviet government. If they are allowed to leave the Soviet Union, where will 
this trend end? The question is fundamental: Disintegrative forces in the 
Soviet Union already are more powerful than anyone among the Soviet reformers 
is likely to have foreseen even two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even letting the East European governments go their own ways was supposed to 
produce reform, not revolutionary change in the European system and the 
unification of Germany. Two years ago the belief in Moscow was that new and 
more competent Communist leaders in Eastern Europe could explore economic and 
political solutions the Soviets might adopt. Reforms there were supposed to 
attract Western investment and Western mechanisms of economic dynamism, to the 
Soviet Union's ultimate benefit. In fact, all but Bulgaria and Romania have 
simply gone over to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the autonomy already accorded the Baltic states was supposed to 
inspire new economic development and new interactions with the West. The Baltic 
republics were supposed to become the Soviets' "Hong Kong." Instead, they now 
reject autonomy and demand independence. Given independence, they, too, are 
expected to go over to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Two critical issues remain to be settled in the course of Soviet reform. The 
first is this question of autonomy for the component republics of the Soviet 
Union, implying, to those who advocate it, democratic decentralization -- but 
threatening national disintegration. The second is German unification. In 
principle, the Soviet Union seems agreed to Germany's unification. In fact, no 
final accord has been reached as to how this will come about, and Soviet forces 
remain in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
If Moscow decides to intervene in Lithuania to block independence, Mikhail 
Gorbachev's central European policy still may be challenged in Moscow. There 
certainly are people there who see the re-creation of a united Germany and the 
autonomist movements inside the U.S.S.R. as dual threats to the survival of the 
Soviet Union as a world power. What happens next in Lithuania must seem to them 
a decisive event. They almost certainly are right.

RENE ENRIQUEZ; CALLETANO ON TV'S 'HILL STREET BLUES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Rene Enriquez, who once rejected advice to change his surname if he 
wanted a career in show business and went on to make Lt. Ray Calletano on "Hill 
Street Blues" a role model for Latinos everywhere, has died of pancreatic 
cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
Enriquez died Friday at his suburban Tarzana home, the Henry Bollinger Public 
Relations firm announced Tuesday. His body was cremated the following day, said 
his sister, Violetta Enriquez. The actor, who was not married and had no 
children, did not want a funeral, she said. 
</P>
<P>
His motion picture credits included a co-starring role with Gary Busey in 
"Bulletproof" and a plum role as Gen. Anastasio Somoza in "Under Fire," 
co-starring Nick Nolte and Gene Hackman. He also appeared with Charles Bronson 
in "The Evil That Men Do." 
</P>
<P>
Enriquez was a familiar face on such television shows as "The Defenders," "The 
Nurses," "Naked City," "Charlie's Angels," "Benson," "Quincy" and "WKRP in 
Cincinnati." 
</P>
<P>
He was also seen in a television movie as Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, the 
Salvadoran prelate and opponent of right-wing death squads and military 
leadership, who was assassinated while celebrating Mass in 1980. But it was as 
Lt. Calletano, the taciturn, second-in-command police officer on the 
Emmy-winning and much beloved "Hill Street" series that Enriquez became known. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the show. It made a powerful statement on the decay of cities and 
human isolation," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
Calletano was as proud and sensitive about his heritage and unhappy about the 
status of Latinos in American society as was the actor who portrayed him. 
</P>
<P>
Enriquez was born in the United States but moved to the family's homeland, 
Nicaragua, as a child. His uncle, Emiliano Chamorro, was once president of that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
At age 16, he returned to the United States, attended City College of San 
Francisco and graduated from Cal State San Francisco after Air Force service 
during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
He studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York and spent more 
than 20 years building a stage and film career before emerging as Lt. 
Calletano. 
</P>
<P>
His role on the show, he told The Times in a 1981 interview, had been written 
for an Anglo actor "but the producers decided to have Hispanics read for it." 
</P>
<P>
An activist for Nosotros and other Latino support agencies, he enjoyed the fact 
that his character was defined only as "Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
"That way Mexicans can identify with me and Puerto Ricans and Cubans. He 
(Calletano) is a man from a low economic status who speaks with little polish 
but who worked his way up."

ADOLPH KOVEN; HELPED RESOLVE CRITICAL STRIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adolph M. Koven, a nationally known labor arbitrator and mediator who helped 
resolve several critical strikes in Los Angeles during his lengthy career, has 
died in a San Francisco hospital after surgery for an aneurysm on his aorta. 
</P>
<P>
Koven, a lawyer who began his career with the National Labor Relations Board in 
1943, was 72 when he died March 18, said his daughter, Judy. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the 1987 Distinguished Service Award from the American Arbitration 
Assn., he also taught labor law, locally at the UCLA Institute of Industrial 
Relations and in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he had lived. 
</P>
<P>
Author of several books on labor law, his opinions had appeared in nearly 100 
volumes of arbitration decisions and he was the featured arbitrator in two 
films used as training devices by his profession. 
</P>
<P>
His major involvements included the chairmanship of the San Francisco Municipal 
Employee Relations Panel in 1974-76; as special mediator in the lengthy 
Southern California Rapid Transit District strike of 1974; the 1956 labor 
dispute between the Southern California Food Employers Council and the Retail 
Clerks Union, and his heading of the state's Mercantile Wage Board in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
When Mayor Tom Bradley appointed him mediator in the 1974 RTD strike, The Times 
called Koven "one of California's most respected and experienced labor 
negotiators. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his daughter, he is survived by his longtime companion, Ruth Maguire, 
and a sister, who ask contributions in his name to the American Civil Liberties 
Union.

EDDIE J. MARTIN; FATHER OF ORANGE COUNTY AVIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie J. Martin, founder of Martin Aviation Inc. and the man regarded as the 
father of aviation in Orange County, died Tuesday at age 88. 
</P>
<P>
Martin died about 9:10 p.m. Tuesday after being admitted to the St. Joseph's 
Hospital in Orange on Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Aviation is Orange County's oldest and largest fixed-base general 
aviation operator. 
</P>
<P>
On Martin's 87th birthday in 1988, the Orange County supervisors voted 
unanimously to name the terminal at the county-operated John Wayne Airport the 
Eddie J. Martin Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, with his brother, Johnny, was granted the original lease in 1923 to 
operate an airfield that became known informally as Eddie Martin Airport. It 
evolved into today's busy county-operated facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Had he not seen aviation as a business, rather than just fun, there may not 
have been much aviation history in Orange County," Vi Smith, author of "From 
Jennies to Jets," an account of the county's aviation history, said in a 1988 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was fond of regaling visitors with stories of his early flying career 
when he would walk on the wings of biplanes to attract customers for his air 
ride business. Martin would charge visitors to the airfield $2 to $5 for a 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, whose original pilot's license was signed by Orville Wright, began his 
aviation career with a Curtiss JN-4D Jenny purchased with $50 he won when he 
took second place in an American Legion automobile race in 1923.

U.S. JUDGE IS URGED TO REJECT LATEST PLEA BY KILLER HARRIS; 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY: STATE CONTENDS THAT THE APPEAL OFFERS NO VALID REASON TO DELAY 
THE CONDEMNED KILLER'S SCHEDULED TUESDAY EXECUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state's lawyers urged a San Diego federal judge Tuesday to deny Robert 
Alton Harris' latest appeal, saying there is no valid legal reason to postpone 
next Tuesday's scheduled execution of the condemned killer. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office claims that Harris failed to offer anything 
in his new appeal that would suggest he was not fairly sentenced to die for the 
1978 killings of two San Diego teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"Payment for crimes is long overdue," the state's lawyers said in legal papers 
filed late Tuesday asking U. S. District Judge William B. Enright in San Diego 
to "put an end to this case." 
</P>
<P>
Enright is scheduled to preside today at a hearing on Harris' new appeal. If 
Enright denies the appeal -- he has turned down Harris twice -- Harris must 
turn to the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the San Francisco-based 
appellate court that serves nine Western states and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' case has progressed further through the court system than any of the 
other more than 270 prisoners' cases on Death Row. His execution would be the 
first in California in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' sole hope for reprieve lies with the federal courts because last week 
he withdrew a request that Gov. George Deukmejian consider clemency -- that is, 
commuting his death sentence to life in prison. The state courts repeatedly 
have denied his pleas for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Supreme Court has rejected Harris' appeals four times, most recently 
Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court affirmed Harris' death sentence in 1981. On March 
16, the state Supreme Court turned down a new appeal that Harris' San Diego 
attorneys, Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe, filed Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The federal appeal, filed Monday, essentially sets forth the same arguments 
that failed to persuade the state Supreme Court to spare the 37-year-old 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest appeal, defense attorneys contend that new psychiatric evidence 
shows that Harris suffered from a variety of mental disorders that played a 
part in the killings. It would be unfair to execute Harris because those 
conditions were not taken into account when he was sentenced, the defense 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the ailments, defense attorneys said, is post-traumatic stress disorder, 
the condition usually associated with combat. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the disorders is that Harris is driven by impulses that, on July 
5, 1978, fed on one another uncontrollably, driving each sequence in the 
killings of Michael Baker and John Mayeski, defense attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris killed both 16-year-old boys after stealing their car for use in a bank 
robbery. He abducted them from a fast-food parking lot where they had just 
ordered lunch. Later, he ate their half-finished hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
Responding Tuesday to the defense claims, the state attorney general's office 
said Harris "knew precisely what he was doing when he kidnaped, robbed and 
killed those boys and when he robbed the bank." 
</P>
<P>
Harris killed the teen-agers because he couldn't afford witnesses, the state's 
lawyers said. When he robbed the bank, he pointed his gun at the teller and 
told him not to call security or he would be killed, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prosecutors said, the evidence was not newly discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' mental state in 1978 has been available for study since 1978, they 
said. No one knows if the labels placed on Harris' mental state now are any 
different from those attached at the time of the 1979 trial because there are 
no reports from the defense psychiatrists, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, they added, the doctors who examined Harris 11 years ago considered 
whether Harris exhibited symptoms of conditions such as post-traumatic stress 
disorder, but rejected those diagnoses and, instead, concluded -- as the 
state's expert did -- that Harris was a psychopath. 
</P>
<P>
As for Harris' "supposed inability" to control his impulsive and violent 
behavior, that contention is inconsistent with some 20 sworn statements 
recently filed in his appeal by friends, prison guards and other inmates, the 
state's lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
All those statements attest to Harris' "warm and caring nature as well as his 
ability to control himself," the prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The danger in Harris' new appeal, the prosecutors said, is that it represents 
nothing more than an abuse of the legal processes and is bound to cause 
disrespect for the courts among a frustrated public. 
</P>
<P>
This new appeal is Harris' "19th bite at the apple," they said, meaning it was 
the 19th time -- not counting pretrial review -- that state or federal courts 
have considered Harris' claims. "The apple is long since consumed and justice 
long overdue," they said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: 'STRESS BUDDY' CREATOR BELIEVES A FRIEND TO KNEAD IS A

Think of him as Gumby for yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
Worry beads for the upwardly mobile. Low-cost therapy to get you past the 4 
p.m. won't-this-day-ever-end hump. 
</P>
<P>
He's Stress Buddy, the invention of Bob Armstrong, who chucked his job as a 
computer salesman to give birth to what he hopes is the perfect under-$10 gift 
for the ulcer set. 
</P>
<P>
It's cheaper than psychiatry and healthier than a double martini. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, 45, who lives in Rancho Bernardo, says the idea came to him late one 
afternoon as he was staring out his office window in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at stress as nature's message for you to lighten up," he said. "That 
afternoon, I realized I was the poster child for Mid-Life Crisis." 
</P>
<P>
What the world needs, he decided, is a 6-inch, flexible plastic figurine that 
can be kneaded and bent and twisted and placed in various spots around the 
torture chamber known as the modern work station. 
</P>
<P>
The road to Stress Buddy was anything but stress free. Enough faxes went to and 
from Armstrong's agent in Hong Kong to fill a big-city phone book. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a two-year exercise in frustration and persistence," Armstrong said. 
"But I'm confident that persistence is going to win out." 
</P>
<P>
A deal has now been struck with a plant in China. Distribution agreements are 
signed with PlayCo and Host International (which runs gift stores in airports 
and hotels) and maybe more later. 
</P>
<P>
Stress Buddy comes complete with his own mini-briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
He can sit atop your desk or computer or Pet Rock. His hands can beckon 
skyward, cover his eyes or grab his pounding head. His legs can be crossed or 
twisted. 
</P>
<P>
And what's next? 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Stress Buddy, of course. The modern lady executive, dressed for success. 
</P>
<P>
Available by this summer's angst season.

Council Vote Won't Hold Water 
</P>
<P>
How toxic is the political atmosphere at San Diego City Hall? 
</P>
<P>
The week began with the council's ruling coalition reacting angrily to Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor's proposal to cut $1 million from her office budget if the 
council will make a similar cut in its budgets. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, the coalition seemed to strike back. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the council summarily rejected the mayoral nomination of Fred 
Thompson to a spot on the County Water Authority board. 
</P>
<P>
Unqualified, said Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer. Thompson was allowed to speak 
only after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In case you're interested, here's the resume of someone deemed unqualified to 
do unpaid public service: 
</P>
<P>
Graduate of San Diego State University. Owner of a public 
relations/marketing/entertainment management firm. 
</P>
<P>
Service on the Mayor's Committee for the Homeless and the boards of the Police 
Athletic League, Aztec Athletic Foundation and Old Mission Beach Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a leadership role in rebuilding the San Ysidro Boys Club, St. Jude's 
Academy and the Southcrest Little League facility. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 46, who is Hispanic, would have been the only minority member on the 
water board. Among those recommending him was banker-civic activist Murray 
Galinson. 
</P>
<P>
Voting no were Wolfsheimer, Linda Bernhardt, Bob Filner, John Hartley and Wes 
Pratt. Only Wolfsheimer offered a reason. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Same Old Rodent Race 
</P>
<P>
Roundup. 
</P>
<P>
* The Del Mar Fair has hired animal fancier and trainer Donna Kingsley of 
Ramona as supervisor of the Fancy Rats and Mice Show for the 1990 Fair. 
</P>
<P>
She promises daily Rat Chats. Sounds Mickey Mouse to me. 
</P>
<P>
* The California Catholic Conference, made up of the state's 27 Roman Catholic 
bishops, meets Thursday and Friday for its semi-annual meeting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among the topics to be discussed will be whether the church should censure 
Catholic politicians who support keeping abortion legal. 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Was it smart for Bishop Leo Maher to scold Lucy Killea during her 
successful race for a State Senate seat, or did it just provoke a pro-Killea 
backlash? 
</P>
<P>
The debate, expected to be spirited, will be behind closed doors.

SEA LIONS TAKE FLOATING HOLIDAY OFF SCRIPPS PIER; 
</P>
<P>
THE COAST: A RESEARCH PLATFORM HAS BECOME A FAVORITE PLACE FOR THE MARINE 
MAMMALS TO CATCH SOME SUN. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM, THE FUN CAN'T LAST. 
</P>

<P>
A batch of new bathing beauties have taken to sunning themselves near Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography these days -- California sea lions that have turned 
a floating research platform into a favorite R &amp; R spot. 
</P>
<P>
"At first there were only three or four, and then it seemed like there were 
more every day," said Kristen Ogwaro, a Scripps administrative assistant who 
watches the sea lions through binoculars and two telescopes brought into the 
office where she works. 
</P>
<P>
Avid watchers at Scripps estimate seeing as many as 40 sea lions around the 
platform, north of the Scripps Pier and about 1,000 feet offshore. 
</P>
<P>
The sea lions provide a chorus of barking for the surfers that dot the waters 
near the UC San Diego oceanographic institute. 
</P>
<P>
Seven or eight sea lions can fit onto the 8-foot-diameter platform at a time, 
and others swim around it. Every now and then, a sea lion slides off the side 
of the yellow float and splashes into the water for a snack. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it looks like they're waiting in line to get onto the raft, like 
people would line up," Ogwaro said. 
</P>
<P>
David W. Skelly, a development engineer in Scripps' Center for Coastal Studies, 
thinks the platform is giving the sea lions not only a place to rest but also a 
food source. It is anchored in about 50 feet of water by four 
refrigerator-thick concrete blocks that provide plenty of nooks and crannies 
for squid and small fish, favorite sea lion foods, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
The float on which the animals have been lolling for the past two months is the 
visible part of an alternative-energy apparatus that the Center for Coastal 
Studies began evaluating in January for an Oklahoma company, Wave Energy. 
</P>
<P>
Underneath the float and perpendicular to it are two white cylinders, about a 
dozen feet long, containing a piston device that moves up and down with the 
waves to generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The pleasure that Scripps workers and visitors are finding in the sea lions 
contrasts with the view taken of them elsewhere in recent months, particularly 
in Monterey and San Francisco bays, where they have worn out their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
The sea lions' population, which was just a few thousand in California waters a 
few decades ago, has rebounded to an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 off Southern 
California, said Brent Stewart, a research scientist at Hubbs Marine Research 
Center, Sea World's independent research arm. 
</P>
<P>
During the breeding season of late May through August, sea lions congregate 
mainly on San Miguel Island off Santa Barbara and San Nicolas Island off Los 
Angeles, with smaller colonies on other offshore islands, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Males are much larger than females, and they migrate northward in non-breeding 
months. Females and the youngest offspring seem to stay closer to the 
rookeries, Stewart said, but older juveniles often wander. As they wander, any 
good place for hauling out of the water and resting will attract them, 
biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
Observers at Scripps say they have seen mainly smaller animals, with an 
occasional exception. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw one big boy the other morning, at least three times as big as the rest," 
said Jeffery Frautschy, retired deputy director of Scripps and acting associate 
director of the Sea Grant program. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists say the sea lions on the platform probably change from day to day 
because the animals move around so much. 
</P>
<P>
The wave-energy experiment -- the float's reason for being -- is on hold until 
a crew can go out and repair damage done in winter storms, Skelly said. But, 
eventually, the experiment will be over, and the float will be brought in. 
</P>
<P>
"My fear is that now we won't be able to remove the float," Skelly said. 
"Because now that float has habitat value, and all the environmental groups 
won't want us to remove it." 
</P>
<P>
But federal officials are unlikely to consider the float's removal a violation 
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, said Jim Lecky, a wildlife biologist with 
the National Marine Fisheries Service on Terminal Island near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're going to give these critters property rights," Lecky said. 
"They've got plenty of protection already."

DEVELOPER NOT GIVING UP ON DISPUTED THEATER SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Despite sharp opposition from the community, Spectator Corp. will persist with 
its proposal to build a $27-million, 25,000-seat outdoor amphitheater at a site 
in Oceanside, the developer's spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mayor Larry Bagley said the project, intended for a 67-acre site 
at El Camino Real and Oceanside Boulevard, was virtually dead because of strong 
neighborhood opposition and stringent city planning requirements. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla-based Spectator has been publicly silent since Bagley's announcement, 
but John Brice, whose public relations firm has been hired by Spectator, said 
Tuesday that "the site that raised concern, that's still our target." 
</P>
<P>
"Our effort is to continue working with that location and to work with the 
neighborhood to satisfy their demands (to offset) traffic, noise and litter," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brice said he could not provide further details, including whether Spectator 
still intends to open the amphitheater by spring of 1991. The mayor has said 
the developer couldn't possibly go through the city's planning process that 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Spectator chief Hal Kolker, a former vice president of the San Diego Clippers 
franchise and a former vice president of the San Diego Sports Arena, has not 
returned phone calls and was out of town Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kolker said in January that the amphitheater would bring symphonies, rock 
concerts and Broadway-class performances to Oceanside, and his proposal 
appeared to have won favor with the local business community. 
</P>
<P>
However, residents in the areas near the proposed site became alarmed at the 
notion of concert noise and up to 8,000 vehicles during peak attendance. Within 
a two-week period earlier this month, 1,600 of them signed petitions opposing 
the amphitheater and lobbied the City Council to reject it. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley, who at first seemed warm to the project, said March 14 that the council 
took a dim view of the plan. Citing Spectator's need to win council support for 
a general plan amendment and a zoning ordinance change, he said it was his 
"strong opinion there is no way (Kolker) can proceed with that parcel of 
property." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Bagley said he "would be surprised" if Spectator remained interested 
in the original site, and he believes the firm is exploring alternative 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time there's this much money earmarked for a project, there are 
alternative locations," said public relations representative Brice, but added 
that he couldn't identify what others might be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Although Spectator will now try to mollify residents at El Camino Real and 
Oceanside Boulevard, there is no indication that opponents will be more 
receptive. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara de la Torre, who organized the neighborhood petition drive, said 
Tuesday that "all the information we've gathered shows it can't be a good site. 
It just would never work." 
</P>
<P>
She argued that traffic and noise from the amphitheater "can't be mitigated" 
and added, "How are you going to stop noise from leaving an open-air 
amphitheater?" 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Sam Williamson said Tuesday that he spoke with Kolker recently 
and learned that other sites are being investigated, and that, "I just told him 
I didn't think there is a place for them in the city of Oceanside."

THIEVES STAB MAN, TAKE HIS GROCERIES

<P>
An Oxnard man who was stabbed in front of a market by two men who took his two 
bags of groceries was in fair condition Tuesday at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Martinez Archila, 22, was leaving a grocery store in the 2800 block of 
Saviers Road when two Latino men approached him, Oxnard police Lt. Stan Myers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men demanded money. When Archila told him that he did not have any, 
the man grabbed him, a fight ensued and Archila was stabbed in the abdomen, 
Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
The men took Archila's bags of groceries, worth about $25, and drove away in a 
brown Chevrolet Impala, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
Police described one assailant as a 30-year-old man with a heavy build and 
about 5 feet, 9 inches tall. The second suspect was described as about 22 years 
old and 5 feet, 9 inches tall, Myers said. CAROL WATSON

CITY SEEKS INCLUSION IN HARBOR DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council, entering the political fray over the Oxnard Harbor 
district, has voted to seek a change in district boundaries which would include 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Local Agency Formation Commission will consider rival proposals 
to expand and shrink boundaries of the harbor district, which now includes 
Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Camarillo and parts of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura resolution, passed Monday evening, supports Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme's position of excluding the rest of the county from the district, but 
calls for Ventura's inclusion on grounds that it is affected by port activities 
and its residents should "have a voice and a vote in the operations of the 
port." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, LAFCO received a report calling for the harbor district to be shrunk 
to include only Oxnard and Port Hueneme, arguing that the two cities bear most 
of the brunt of truck traffic to and from the seaport and that residents of the 
two cities would be better served by a smaller port district. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Oxnard Harbor District wants district boundaries to be 
expanded countywide. The increased prestige would help the harbor obtain trade 
advantages that would increase business and revenue, port officials contend.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: INNKEEPER SEEKS NEW CONDO LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WEINSTOCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tenacious innkeeper who battled Ventura City Hall and last year thwarted 
construction of a condominium complex that she claimed would have dwarfed her 
Victorian bed and breakfast is at it again. 
</P>
<P>
Gisela Baida, owner of La Mer Bed and Breakfast in the 400 block of Poli Street 
in downtown Ventura, insists that the redesigned stucco complex "doesn't fit 
into the block" of mostly wood, single-story houses. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the sleek new Island View Townhouse Project, next to La Mer, a 
European-style inn housed in a 100-year-old landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 6,000-square-foot complex "squishes everything to the property 
line," Baida said. The building would be constructed 5 feet from the edge of 
her lot, reducing the privacy of her guests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't come if they have to keep their curtains drawn," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Baida scoffed at the offer by Michael Wooten, president of Darrick Marten 
Development Co., to build a 10- or 20-foot-high wall between the two properties 
with a European-style fountain on her side. Instead, Baida said, she wants the 
complex set back 10 feet from the property line. 
</P>
<P>
The height of the building, which will rise 8 feet above her roof, is another 
sore point. "It doesn't need to be three stories," Baida said. La Mer has two 
stories and a loft. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after intense lobbying by Baida, the City Council rejected the 
condominium proposal because it was too tall and bulky and would dwarf La Mer. 
</P>
<P>
Baida has similar objections to the new design submitted by Wooten. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reduced the building by about 10% overall and reconfigured the units," 
Wooten said, adding that the lower ones now sit partially below ground level. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current proposal, the building would be set into the hillside, 
reducing the height to less than 37 feet high, lowered from 45 last year, and 
will stand 30 feet from the street with each level terracing back even further, 
Wooten said. 
</P>
<P>
At the base "it is slightly in front of La Mer, but significantly behind the 
building on the left, which is at a 20-foot setback," Wooten noted. 
</P>
<P>
Baida is pleased with the setback from the street, but she said she fears a 
drop in business if the proposal is approved at an April 4 City Council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our scenic drive," Baida said, referring to the historic buildings 
along Poli. "It won't be any more after this. Ventura is known as a historical 
town. It will be lost if this is the new design." 
</P>
<P>
Baida said she is certain that if Ventura residents knew about the proposal, 
they would turn out and speak against it. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wooten is also confident. "We believe it's a project the City 
Council can support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lining up in support of Wooten's proposal are the city's Historic Preservation 
Commission, Architectural Review Board, Planning Commission and the Downtown 
Ventura Assn. CAROL WEINSTOCK

TRUSTEES TO STUDY PARKING LOT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to build a new parking lot and community playground adjacent to 
Camarillo High School will be considered today by the Oxnard Union High School 
District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed lot, which would be built on about five acres of an 11.89-acre 
parcel that would be bought for $3.1 million, would make the journey to and 
from Camarillo High School safer for students who drive to school, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Students park across the street and must dodge heavy traffic on Mission Oaks 
Boulevard to get to classes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important in terms of the safety issue," district Business Manager 
Bob Brown said of the arking lot. "It's dangerous to have students crossing the 
street in the early morning hours when traffic is particularly heavy, and then 
again in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
No serious accidents near the school have been reported, but Principal Don 
Bathgate said he is concerned that the steady stream of traffic on Mission Oaks 
Boulevard endangers students' lives. "I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we 
don't have a student hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If trustees agree to the $6-per-square-foot purchase price, the district hopes 
to develop the remaining portion of the land into a community playground and 
athletic fields once the parking lot is built. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations began in 1980 to buy the property from owners James FitzGerald, 
Geraldine Chapman FitzGerald, Gerald FitzGerald and Carmelita Nicholson, but 
repeatedly stalled over the purchase price. The four agreed to accept the 
school district's latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
Certificates of participation to finance the land purchase were issued last 
December, Brown said. The trustees will meet at 5 p.m., in the district office, 
309 South K St., Oxnard. CAROLYN KUSKY

COUNCIL PANEL OKS PLAN TO PRESERVE VIEW FROM MULHOLLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council planning committee on Tuesday approved a plan 
designed to preserve the view from the city's most famous scenic roadway, the 
22 miles of Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member Planning and Land Use Management Committee unanimously 
endorsed the Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan after more than two hours 
of debate between property owners, environmentalists and fans of the winding, 
two-lane road along the crest of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The plan has been worked on for about 17 years by planners, politicians and a 
citizens advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted by the City Council, the plan would protect views of Los Angeles, 
the Santa Monica Mountains and the San Fernando Valley by regulating the height 
and location of buildings, fences and walls along Mulholland Drive from the 
Hollywood Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard. It would prohibit grading and 
construction within 50 feet of the top of mountain ridges or within 100 feet of 
a stream bank. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the plan proposed construction of a bicycle path and a trail along the 
roadside for pedestrians, joggers and equestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Mountaintop landowners have criticized the plan for several years, saying it 
would rob them of their property rights by making thousands of parcels 
virtually impossible to develop. 
</P>
<P>
But committee Chairman Hal Bernson said: "This city is definitely moving in the 
direction of preserving our open spaces. Let it be known that we are not going 
to allow areas like this to deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
The committee, however, dodged the controversial question of whether the 
western portion of the road should be paved to alleviate traffic congestion. 
Encino residents have complained that their neighborhood streets are clogged 
with motorists who use them as alternatives to the crowded San Diego Freeway. 
They said paving Mulholland Drive from Encino Hills Drive -- where Mulholland 
now becomes a rough dirt road -- to Reseda Boulevard would help ease some of 
the traffic on those streets by routing some of it farther west into Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
The issue set off a bitter dispute between some Tarzana and Encino groups, 
leading to fistfights at one neighborhood meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The committee instructed the city planning, engineering and transportation 
departments to study the paving issue and report back. 
</P>
<P>
Some property owners complained to the committee that the plan would result in 
the area becoming more crowded with speeders, tourists and gang members, who 
now sometimes hold impromptu parties alongside the semi-rural road.

AIR BASE TO BUY A BILLION GALLONS OF WATER ANNUALLY; 
</P>
<P>
EDWARDS: OFFICIALS SIGN A 10-YEAR DEAL WITH THE REGION'S MAJOR SUPPLIER TO HELP 
CURTAIL GROUND-WATER PUMPING, WHICH IS CRACKING THE SPACE SHUTTLE'S RUNWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edwards Air Force Base, seeking to solve a serious water shortage and preserve 
the landing ground of the space shuttle, has agreed to buy more than a billion 
gallons of water a year from an Antelope Valley supplier, a deal that officials 
insist will not mean shortages for the rest of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said their use of water from the Antelope Valley-East Kern 
Water Agency could help preserve the base's famed dry lake bed runways, where 
the shuttles land. The new water supply will allow Edwards to curtail 
ground-water pumping, which is believed to be contributing to the sinking and 
cracking of the lake bed. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement is not in time to save the Mojave Desert base from a second 
summer of water rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, the second largest Air Force base in the 48 contiguous states, would 
initially pay nearly $1.6 million a year under a 10-year contract with the 
water agency, known as AVEK, which wholesales water to the region. 
</P>
<P>
"AVEK is definitely going to be an essential part of our infrastructure," said 
Bob Johnstone, chief of Edwards' plans and policies division. "Everyone is 
saying it's going to be expensive to use AVEK water. But we didn't really have 
any other options." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards will pay the water agency nearly three times as much for water as the 
agency's other customers, mainly because the others pay taxes to the agency. 
But the air base, as federal property, does not. 
</P>
<P>
Johnstone said he could not say how much the base now pays to produce its own 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The water pact, which makes the agency the base's major water supplier, was 
approved Tuesday night by its board of directors. Air Force officials said a 
formal contract could be signed within a week. The pact had been under 
discussion for nearly a year, Johnstone said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards now gets all of its water from on-base wells. But many of those have 
been failing due to age or have been shut down because of natural arsenic 
contamination. When it has the agency's water, the base will use the wells only 
during the high-demand summer months. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the estimated 20,000 daytime residents of the base, including 
employees and their families, sweated out mandatory water conservation measures 
because of the dwindling water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Base officials predict that the same measures will be required this summer 
because, water agency officials said, they do not expect to begin supplying 
water to Edwards until early 1991. It will take that long for the agency to 
build a 1.25-mile pipeline connecting the base to a feeder line. That $660,000 
project is part of the overall contract. 
</P>
<P>
The water the agency plans to supply to Edwards -- nearly 3 million gallons a 
day -- is equal to about 11% of all the drinking water supplied by the agency 
last year. Because of the drought, the agency this year expects that deliveries 
of water from the California Aqueduct will fall short of the demands by its 
water retailers. But agency General Manager Wallace Spinarski said the agency 
should have enough water by 1991, when the Edwards service will begin, to meet 
all demands. 
</P>
<P>
The water agency is the major supplier of State Water Project water to a 
2,300-square-mile area that includes the Antelope Valley and portions of Kern 
County.

EMERGENCY PLAN TO EASE METHANE THREAT IN FAIRFAX AREA GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key committee of the Los Angeles City Council has approved emergency measures 
to try to prevent another dangerous buildup of underground gas at a 
methane-plagued intersection in the Fairfax District. 
</P>
<P>
"We know where the gas will migrate, and we know how strong the pressure is. 
The only thing we don't know is when it will blow again," said Joseph W. 
Cobarrubias, a city geologist who briefed the committee recently on his 
investigation of the latest gas scare at the corner of 3rd Street and Ogden 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection has been the site of two major gas leaks in recent years, 
including the 1985 explosion and fire that injured 24 people in the Ross Dress 
for Less store. 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident occurred in February, 1989, when methane appeared in nearly 
explosive concentrations in the basement of a K mart store on the south side of 
3rd Street. The same day, a fountain of gas, water and mud also popped up 
through a crack in a parking lot near the Gilmore Bank on the north side of the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the report of a task force headed by Cobarrubias, the Budget and 
Finance Committee agreed to adopt his recommendations and instructed him to 
prepare to implement them. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the committee chairman, 
said it was a "foregone conclusion" that the City Council would approve the 
task force's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we talking here about a dangerous situation, potentially?" Yaroslavsky 
asked during the geologist's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Cobarrubias said. 
</P>
<P>
"Very dangerous?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. . . . As soon as it hits a crack in a foundation, it can spread and fill 
an entire room." 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty scary. . . . Are you telling me then that somebody's pilot light 
or lit cigar could cause it to explode?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, or a light switch." 
</P>
<P>
Cobarrubias said nearby residential areas are not at risk, because lawns and 
gardens allow methane seeping from the ground to dissipate harmlessly. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that the acres of asphalt and concrete in the commercial district 
along 3rd Street act as a cap that prevents the methane from dissipating. 
</P>
<P>
"Nature's been doing this for a million years, and it's been safe until man 
plunked down this pavement," Cobarrubias said. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection of 3rd and Ogden sits atop a pocket of compressed sand about 
42 feet below the surface, where the gas accumulates at unusually high 
pressures -- from 20 to 27 pounds per square inch, compared with four pounds 
per square inch for the rest of the Fairfax area, according to Cobarrubias. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the gas is the subject of a pending lawsuit filed by victims of 
the 1985 Ross fire. Their attorneys blame the operators of a nearby oil field, 
but Cobarrubias said his task force found no evidence to justify that claim. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the source, the task force was more concerned with preventing 
another explosion and recommended a variety of measures. The committee adopted 
them in principle and indicated that the necessary money would be made 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations are the installation of venting wells on a 
500-foot-long swatch of private property extending from 3rd Street; the 
installation of trenches and vents beneath the intersection, and additional 
inspectors to enforce requirements for gas detectors and other safety devices 
in commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The wells on the private property could cost about $60,000, which would be 
split among the various owners of the Farmers Market, the Town and Country 
Shopping Center and the Park La Brea Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
The city's costs would amount to about $70,000, but officials said that state 
funds are expected to cover most of that.

<P>
LANDFILL: A PROPOSED JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A 
190-MILLION-TON DUMP IN THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Billing it as a historic moment, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
voted Tuesday to end its long garbage-disposal feud with the city of Los 
Angeles by forming a partnership to confront the region's growing garbage 
problem together. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the city and county, operating under a joint powers 
authority, would create a huge dump in Elsmere Canyon in the Santa Clarita 
Valley. The city of Los Angeles would be entitled to dump a large portion of 
its garbage there. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest winners in the proposed pact, which still must be approved 
by the Los Angeles City Council, are Westside activists who have vehemently 
opposed the county's effort to operate landfills in Mission, Rustic and 
Sullivan canyons. Under the agreement, the county's sanitation districts would 
agree never to convert the three canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains into 
dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Rustic and Sullivan canyons would be turned over to a public agency for 
recreational purposes. The agreement would permit the county to sell its 
Mission Canyon property, which at one time was a county landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential winners could be San Fernando Valley residents who have lobbied 
to close the Lopez Canyon landfill near Lake View Terrace. Under the agreement, 
the city-owned dump will close within a year after the Elsmere Canyon Landfill 
opens. The pact, however, leaves open the possibility of reactivating Lopez 
Canyon if Elsmere Canyon no longer can accept garbage. Some activists have 
alleged that the proposal to close Lopez Canyon is an attempt to deceive them 
into supporting the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the joint powers agreement on a 3 to 1 vote, with Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum opposing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think today this board has the opportunity to take a major step toward 
laying the foundation for meeting the solid waste disposal for Los Angeles 
County for several decades," Supervisor Deane Dana said before the vote. "And 
that's what this tentative agreement creating this solid waste management joint 
powers authority represents." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose district encompasses much of the Westside, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this agreement between the city and county is an historic agreement," 
Edelman said. "It recognizes for the first time that we both face a common 
enemy, and that is the failure in the past to work together to solve a very 
important need." 
</P>
<P>
The soonest that sanitation officials could open the 190-million-ton Elsmere 
Canyon Landfill is 1995. The dump would be operated by the new public agency, 
which would need approvals by various government agencies certifying that the 
dump would be environmentally safe. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has outraged the Santa Clarita City Council, which last month 
voted unanimously to oppose the dump. Critics contend that the landfill would 
pollute Santa Clarita air and underground water supplies and lead to traffic 
jams. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to appease Santa Clarita officials, the agreement includes 
provisions that the dump authority pay that city 5 cents for every ton dumped 
at the site. The city of Los Angeles also would donate 50 acres it owns in 
Saugus for a Santa Clarita civic center site and another 160 acres in Saugus 
would be transferred to a Castaic Lake water agency. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Santa Clarita City Councilman Dennis Koontz 
unsuccessfully urged the supervisors not to approve the plan until an 
environmental impact report is completed. Saying that he was disappointed, but 
not surprised, he promised that the city of Santa Clarita "would regroup and 
will come out with a strategy." 
</P>
<P>
The site of the proposed dump is owned by the U.S. Forest Service, but BKK 
Inc., a solid waste management company, is negotiating to buy it. The joint 
powers agency would eventually buy the land from BKK after the company had 
obtained environmental approvals for the project.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council committee has recommended a $65 rate increase for the ambulance 
company that provides paramedic service to the city but rejected a request for 
a two-year extension of the city's contract with the company. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection by the Public Services and Safety Committee of the extension 
proposed by Hartson Medical Services raises the possibility of a paramedic 
strike as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedic union leaders had sided with the ambulance company and favored the 
extension so both sides can make final a recently negotiated three-year labor 
contract. The city's agreement with Hartson expires June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Hartson and the Service Employees International Union, Local 102, which 
represents paramedics, wanted the two-year extension so it could coincide with 
the scheduled end of the tentative labor contract settlement. 
</P>
<P>
However, the committee said that its staff needs two months to study the 
extension request. The City Council is expected to make a final decision next 
week. Union leaders said paramedics will also vote on the contract next week 
but may reject it unless the council approves the extension. If the pact is 
rejected, paramedics could strike, union leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
The $65 rate increase approved by the committee brings Hartson's average 
ambulance charge up to $347 a trip. Company officials had asked for a $145 
increase. The increase is necessary to pay a 21% pay increase negotiated by the 
union for paramedics, Hartson officials said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CORONADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coronado police pursued two car thieves across the Coronado Bridge and into the 
streets of Logan Heights Tuesday. Police got the car, but the thieves got away. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that they saw a car being stolen near Star Park Circle 
and Loma Avenue in Coronado about 2 p.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A patrol car and unmarked police car spotted the stolen car as it was going 
through the bridge toll plaza and followed it to the Crosby Street exit in 
Logan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by Coronado Police Chief Jerry Boyd, the 
officers chased the car through "several side streets and alleys." The car 
finally hit a tree in the 2100 block of Newtown Avenue. The two men in the car 
ran away, and police impounded the vehicle. A stereo was stolen from the car. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses who saw the two running said one had a handgun and may have also cut 
his head in the crash. The second man was bitten by a dog as he jumped over a 
fence.

SUNLAND-TUJUNGA: A COUNCILMAN SAYS THE AREA IS ONE OF THE LAST IN THE CITY 
WHERE AN AVERAGE FAMILY CAN HAVE A MODEST HOME AND A HORSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A new interim ordinance placing strict controls on new apartments and 
condominiums is the first step in a plan to head off further urban intrusion 
into Sunland-Tujunga, one of the last semi-rural areas in Los Angeles, City 
Councilman Joel Wachs said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs, who represents the area, said a community plan adopted in 1980 has 
allowed large, dense apartment buildings to proliferate along Sunland and 
Foothill boulevards, and Commerce Avenue. Many of the buildings cast shadows 
over adjacent single-family houses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to put a stop to that," Wachs said. "Sunland-Tujunga's unique. This is 
one of the last remaining areas in the city where an average family can have a 
modest home and a horse." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, adopted by the City Council last Friday, was introduced by Wachs 
in response to complaints from residents about blocked views and parking and 
traffic problems resulting from apartment and condominium construction. 
</P>
<P>
The measure limits the height of future apartment buildings to two stories or 
30 feet, restricts density to one unit per 1,850 square feet of land and 
requires at least 50% of the open space in a parcel under development to be 
landscaped. The interim ordinance will remain in place until permanent controls 
are enacted. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 community plan for Sunland-Tujunga allowed apartment buildings to be 
as tall as six stories and to have a maximum of 54 units per half-acre. The 
interim ordinance would allow a maximum of 14 units on a half-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of an overall approach to preserving the community's character," 
Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have done . . . is to take a major step towards halting the damage 
caused by the reckless developments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said he will appoint a citizens committee to write a specific plan for 
the community that will include provisions to revitalize commercial areas and 
protect hillside areas. The committee will recommend changes to the community 
plan on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis, Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Gross, land use chairwoman for the Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of Residents, 
said residents hope to develop a plan that will attract new types of commercial 
development instead of more auto-repair shops and fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be more delighted," she said of Wachs' plan. "We shouldn't have those 
apartments on Foothill. We need new quality retail business." 
</P>
<P>
The new plan is expected to take two years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings on an interim ordinance to control hillside development will 
begin April 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We must save our mountainsides so that they won't be carved up like 
Glendale's," Gross said. "You look at the hillsides there and you see nothing 
but bad. We can't let that happen here. This is the last open land in the whole 
city."

WOMAN ACCUSED OF MOLESTING SONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank woman who directs the Glendale Bar Assn.'s Lawyer Referral Service 
has been charged with sexually molesting her three young sons. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Bond, 38, faces nine felony counts of child molestation that 
prosecutors say occurred between September, 1985, and last December. 
</P>
<P>
Bond, director of a nonprofit service that makes referrals for low-cost legal 
assistance, is expected to surrender April 4 for her arraignment in Burbank 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, she could face up to 24 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were filed last Wednesday after an investigation by Burbank police. 
Authorities were alerted in December after the eldest boy reported the alleged 
incidents to his father, Michael Bond, who is divorced from Kathleen Bond, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Collier. 
</P>
<P>
Collier said all three boys told him they had been sexually molested by their 
mother. But he said he had no physical evidence of molestation and would not 
describe what kind of acts allegedly occurred, referring to them only as 
fondling and "lewd conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Klahs, who is representing Kathleen Bond, said Tuesday the allegations 
were false and attributed them to the tumultuous climate of the Bonds' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the alleged incidents reportedly occurred while Michael, 39, and 
Kathleen Bond were still married and living together. The couple separated last 
February and filed for divorce last March, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bond, a Burbank tax attorney, initially took custody of the two oldest 
boys and the youngest stayed with his mother. But the third child was turned 
over to his father's care in December after police began investigating the 
alleged molestations, according to court records.

<P>
State Farm Insurance has agreed to award an undisclosed sum to the parents of 
an 8-year-old Imperial Beach boy who died after he was accidently shot and 
killed in a neighbor's house this month. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was for injuries the boy suffered in a car accident more than 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Charles B. Pederson, a La Jolla attorney representing the parents of the child, 
Richard Krecklow II, released a statement that said, "The Krecklows and State 
Farm have agreed to settle all claims for personal injuries sustained by 
Richard Krecklow on Dec. 7, 1987, prior to his unfortunate death. . . . The 
parties have also agreed that the terms of the settlement will remain 
confidential." 
</P>
<P>
John Cross, a State Farm division claims supervisor, said Tuesday that the 
agreement with Pederson was reached a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pederson had said in an earlier interview that, the day before the boy was 
shot, his parents had accepted a $225,000 offer from State Farm to settle the 
auto accident case. But the insurance company, Pederson said, had told him it 
wanted to reevaluate the settlement because the boy was dead and the settlement 
had never been approved in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster was struck by a car while in a crosswalk at 3rd and K streets in 
Chula Vista, Pederson said. The child was cut and bruised and had scars over 
much of his body after being dragged 120 feet. The driver was insured by State 
Farm.

A judge refused Tuesday to lower bail for Ernest Booker Brown, a Knox 
Elementary School teacher charged with 30 sex crimes against two female 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 47, remains in County Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail, after Superior 
Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez said the bail amount was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is to go on trial June 15 on charges of molesting the girls, both 12, who 
testified against him in a closed preliminary hearing last month. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Alex Landon, cited Brown's ties to the community in arguing for a 
bail of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz, noting that he had filed two additional child 
molestation counts against Brown on Tuesday, unsuccessfully asked that bail be 
raised to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant is facing 70 years if convicted," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Brown had a child molestation conviction in Florida in 1977 
when he was a teacher there. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was arrested Nov. 30 at the Southeast San Diego school where he was 
teaching fourth- and fifth-graders.

A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed and an adult companion wounded in Logan 
Heights, police reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two were standing in front of a house in the 2400 block of K Street shortly 
before 11 p.m. Monday, when several shots were fired at them from a car that 
had stopped nearby, said Dave Cohen, a Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The light-colored car then sped off. Police believe there were at least two 
people in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said police found several shotgun and semiautomatic casings at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old, Javier Martinez, was shot in the chest and stomach. He was 
pronounced dead on arrival at UCSD Medical Center. His companion, Jorge H. 
Torres, 21, was shot in the upper thigh and ankle. Torres was discharged 
Tuesday, said hospital spokeswoman Nancy Stringer. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the shooting was gang related, said Lt. George Saldamando of the 
department's gang unit. He said the unit is helping homicide detectives.

A bank robber got a jolt for his trouble Tuesday after presenting a teller with 
a demand note and walking out with $580 and a "dye pack." 
</P>
<P>
The dye pack, hidden among the bills, exploded and showered the man with tear 
gas and red dye as he walked out of the Great American Bank in 16900 block of 
Bernardo Center Drive in Rancho Bernardo, said Police Department spokesman Bill 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The man fled, but all but $20 was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the man also robbed Great American's Scripps Ranch branch of 
more than $1,600 on March 21. The man is described as white, with stringy blond 
hair. Robinson said he has a pockmarked and acne-ridden complexion. He is about 
5-foot-8 and weighs about 140 pounds.

'CRACKWALKER' A STROLL ON THE SQUALID SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Crackwalker," Toronto playwright Judith Thompson's scabrous dissection of 
four emotional and psychological cripples, is such a hair shirt of a production 
at the Odyssey that it's uncomfortable to watch. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean it's not a bracing experience. It's much like "Drugstore 
Cowboy" without the drugs. The crack in the title is not cocaine. It's the thin 
line between decency and squalor. 
</P>
<P>
Under Colman deKay's rigorous direction, the rejects and castoffs in this 
uncompromising play are so sharply observed that you can imagine that a social 
worker wrote it (and in fact, Thompson was one when she wrote it in 1980 at the 
age of 26). The plot and situations are routine enough. We follow two couples 
as they lust and squabble and batter one another with inchoate anger. Misery 
and fear keep their motors running. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson has created authentic voices, particularly the odd scratchy sounds 
that creep from a repulsive but not irredeemable basket case named Therese, 
played with tour de force abandon by Hallie Todd. Her confused companion/lover, 
who's only slightly less dim than she is, is softly, almost delicately played 
by Willie Garson. The worst case scenario for this couple, the arrival of a 
baby, establishes the playwright's acutely painful subject: the helplessness of 
society when the pitiable aren't derelict enough to merit help. 
</P>
<P>
The other couple, although more accessible, is equally pathetic and trapped. 
He's a vulgar, coarse trucker and she is his hapless love slave. They knock 
each other around a lot and then get lovey. Peter Schreiner deftly catches his 
character's rooster-in-the-hen-yard swagger, and Lysa Hayland refreshingly 
portrays her victim as an attractive, self-possessed woman who's not nearly as 
strong as she looks. 
</P>
<P>
The wide, black Odyssey 3 stage can be a problem for set designers to fill, but 
Alan Jones' apartment/diner design catches the requisite shabbiness with the 
help of Lynne Peryon and Doc Ballard's isolated pools of lighting. Lili Dove's 
costumes nicely define characterization.

SDSU'S OPEN AIR CONCERTS ATTRACT A STRONG OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's 14th annual concert series at San Diego State University's Open Air 
Theater gets off to an unusually strong start Friday night with the Cult. 
</P>
<P>
Since the release a year ago of the group's "Sonic Temple" album, the British 
trio has become one of the most popular rock groups in the world. Buoyed by the 
Top 40 success of "Fire Woman," the album quickly went platinum, and the Cult's 
concert draw increased steadily to the point where sold-out shows -- even in 
multithousand-seat arenas -- are now the rule rather than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
This recent success can be attributed to the band's belated decision to blend 
its original cerebral image with high-voltage, mainstream rock 'n' roll, 
complete with thick chording and hard-biting guitar runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cult's roots date to 1982, when singer-guitarist Ian Astbury put together a 
band, the Southern Death Cult. The group's intellectual post-punk sound -- 
heavy on atmosphere, texture and internal conflicts -- was acclaimed by 
critics, but pretty much ignored by the public, except in their native England, 
where they enjoyed sporadic success. 
</P>
<P>
Two years -- and various personnel changes -- later, the Southern Death Cult's 
name was shortened to the Cult, and an album, "Dream Time," was released by 
Sire Records. Despite the backing of an internationally distributed record 
label, the Cult remained, well, a cult band for some time. In the all-important 
U.S. market, air play was limited to college radio stations, and in 1986 the 
Cult was presented with the American College Radio Single of the Year award for 
"She Sells Sanctuary," from their second album, "Love." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Cult finally found a way to go commercial without selling out: 
Combining passion with aggression, emotion with commotion, the eclectic with 
the electric, to come up with music that not only makes the mind tick and the 
heart pound, but the feet move and the hips shake. 
</P>
<P>
They defined this mix on their third album, "Electric," which went gold (for 
sales of 500,000 or more); they refined it on album four, "Sonic Temple," which 
went platinum (for sales in excess of 1 million). 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, then, that the Cult's Friday night show at the 4,835-seat Open Air 
Theater is expected to be a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Country Dick Montana of the Beat Farmers got out of the hospital 
after a seven-day stay for surgery to remove five tumors from his throat. 
</P>

"The medical term is a 'radical full-neck dissection,' and that's pretty much 
how I feel: like somebody dissected my neck," Montana said. "Most of my neck 
and the right side and the back side of my head are completely numb; they must 
have severed a lot of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"But they spent a couple of extra hours in surgery to save the voice, and that 
seems to have worked. My speaking voice is the same, and while I have lost some 
range in the singing department -- the willowy eye-watering tenor is chopped in 
half, with the high end completely gone -- I hope to regain that as time goes 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Since his release from the hospital, Montana has been recuperating at home, 
hoping that his vocal cords will be sufficiently healed in time for the Beat 
Farmers' next concert, Sunday night at Park Place in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
And while he's still waiting to get his voice back, he's already regained his 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems natural for us to be playing April Fool's Day in a bowling alley 
in El Cajon," Montana said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The Beat Farmers, incidentally, are in the process of severing ties with 
MCA/Curb Records, which has released their last three albums, amid allegations 
of label indifference. Anticipating a quick settlement, Montana said, the band 
is currently entertaining offers from several other record companies, including 
Capitol Records. 
</P>
<P>
The Beat Farmers' next album is already in the can. Tentatively titled either 
"Beat Farmacy" or "Loud and Plowed," the group's first live album was recorded 
New Year's Eve at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa and mixed in February at the 
Indigo Ranch recording studio in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The album will include "pretty wild versions" of Beat Farmers favorites like 
"Riverside" and "Happy Boy," Montana said, as well as covers of the Kinks' 
"20th Century Man" and Kenny Rogers' "Lucille." 
</P>
<P>
"People have been telling us for years that our albums haven't been catching 
the intensity of our live shows," Montana said, "and I think we've got that 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Janet Jackson is due in for an April 23 concert at San Diego 
Sports Arena. It will be her first performance at the arena, but not her first 
visit. Five years ago, Phil Quinn, the arena's executive vice president and 
general manager, recalled, he received a phone call from the then-upstart 
singer's manager. "I forgot what the concert was, but she wanted to attend, and 
she didn't want to sit down there in the seats on the floor," Quinn said. "So I 
invited her to sit up in the owner's box, and she accepted my invitation." The 
April 23 concert, by the way, sold out less than two hours after tickets went 
on sale. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This Friday, veteran pop crooner Frankie Laine, a San Diego resident since the 
late 1960s, turns 77. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale today at 10 a.m. for the May 9 concert by Gun and Heretix at 
the Bacchanal, and Saturday at noon for shock-comic Andrew Dice Clay's April 24 
appearance at the Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Eric Johnson with Kyle Brock &amp; Tommy 
Taylor, tonight at the Bacchanal; Bobby Blue Bland, Thursday at Smokey's in 
Mission Valley; Screamin' Jay Hawkins with the Forbidden Pigs, Thursday at the 
Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; the Cult with Dangerous Toys and Tora Tora,

SLAP AT SEX IN VIENNA GENERATES LITTLE HEAT

In the course of the 10 scenes of Arthur Schnitzler's "La Ronde," we meet 10 
couples from all strata of society. They seduce and submit to each other, and 
then move on to other partners in a hollow dance of immediate gratification. 
Schnitzler's reported aim was to castigate the Viennese society of his time 
(1903) for its degradation of love from a spiritual passion to an animal 
appetite. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Fullerton, there is plenty of talk about sex and a good deal of 
perfunctory disrobing, but no real sexual heat is generated. The characters are 
reduced to an interchangeable collection of shallow hedonists. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Mendivil does bring a notable maturity to her role as the Young Wife, 
and a genuine sense of character. Her scene with Darrold Strubbe as the Husband 
is the high point of the production. And Melinda Suzanne Riemer as the Maid 
seemed to yearn for something more from the Soldier (Kevin Bossenmeyer) than a 
roll in the grass. That yearning evaporated in the following scene, however, 
when she flounced merrily into dalliance with the Young Man (Charles 
Gallagher). 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the production plays like a series of blackout skits revolving 
around low-rent seduction jokes. The sex acts within each scene, so obscene and 
objectionable to Schnitzler's contemporaries, are rendered here as loud, 
suggestive noises and one or two comic outbursts in a blackout. A short 
blackout. These Viennese are not only shallow, but speedy. 
</P>
<P>
What they are not is dangerous. The evils that Schnitzler wrote to reprove seem 
toothless here. In the age of AIDS, only the foolhardy would indulge their sex 
drives so recklessly. But woe betide us if we can watch these characters lust 
and pose and lie, and envy them the simplicity of their empty lives. 
</P>
<P>
The set, by Todd Muffatti and Rahnee Chung, is handsome, with graceful lines 
and serviceable double turntables. The flats are textured with squiggles and 
patterns that look like patches of crushed velvet, flocked wallpaper, tassels 
and tapestries mired in a gray mud. There's a hint of grandeur hidden and 
besmirched. It doesn't help, though, that the scene-change music, featuring an 
accordion and guitar arrangement perfect for a gondola ride, is not at all 
evocative of turn-of-the-century Vienna. 
</P>

Record Controversy Still 'Nasty': A Republican candidate for the Indiana state 
Senate will hold a news conference in Indianapolis today to announce the 
results of a private sting he conducted March 21, in which a 14-year-old boy 
and a 12-year-old girl, wired with tape recorders, allegedly purchased copies 
of the 2 Live Crew's sexually explicit album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" at a 
Carmel, Ind., record store. John Price, the Senate candidate and head of 
Decency in Broadcasting, an Indianapolis-based media watchdog group, said he 
intends to use the incident to campaign for stricter obscenity codes in 
Indiana.BETH KLEID

Protest at Argentine Oscar Site: About 200 Argentine film industry workers, 
protesting against tax exemptions for foreign films, staged a noisy 
demonstration outside a theater in Buenos Aires where winners of two Hollywood 
Oscars were announced early Tuesday. While Charlton Heston and Argentine 
actress Norma Aleandro read out the winners of the best documentary categories, 
outside the Colon Theatre film workers handed out leaflets which read: "Oscar 
pays no taxes. Today television shows a black-tie Argentina to the world, 
hiding the reality of a devastated industry, with thousands of unemployed 
artists and technicians." BETH KLEID

'HAIR' AT FULLERTON OFFERS RETURN TRIP TO AGE OF AQUARIUS 
</P>

<P>
Director Gary Gardner presents Fullerton College's "Hair" as something of a 
history lesson, almost a seminar on the Age of Aquarius augmented by a cast of 
dozens. 
</P>
<P>
The college's Campus Theatre has been turned into the expected psychedelic 
menagerie, brimming with peace symbols, protest signs and longhaired, 
bead-swinging kids, all moving to Galt McDermott's rockish score. But Gardner, 
with help from Jay Shelp and set designer Bob Jensen, also has a giant 
projection screen looming in the background. 
</P>
<P>
The musical begins with images of JFK and LBJ, giving way to love-ins and 
demonstrations. Slides of Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Beatles and others flash 
in a steady stream. And as the show progresses, we see photos designed to 
underscore the action and make it more relevant. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a bad idea. For one thing, it shows Gardner's respectful attitude 
toward Gerome Ragni and James Rado's 1967 Broadway hit. "Hair," after all, was 
once hailed as a signpost of the times, and was perhaps the first musical to 
use rock as the primary impetus for its music. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Gardner is committed to reminding his audience, a large percentage 
being Fullerton College students, that the '60s were important and 
extraordinary, and that a generation of young people was in large part 
responsible. He makes the point too obviously, but there is inspiration at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
As a musical experience, however, this "Hair" has too many ragged edges. 
</P>
<P>
The textures are basically right -- the costumes (uncredited) are 
bell-bottomed, tie-dyed and sloppy cool, and Jensen's sprawling set, though 
messy, incorporates symbols of the times. He's even put a vintage VW bus on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner falters, though, in the tempo he generates. In most numbers, he opts 
for spirited renditions, which make for a generally correct handling of this 
antic musical. But just about every scene is offered as a celebratory 
freak-out, with the entire cast getting in on it, and that leads to redundancy 
and predictability. 
</P>
<P>
As for his performers, Gardner has a spunky group with some decent voices, 
although many are still "in training." Jeff Weeks' Berger, the hippy leader, is 
sassy and egotistical, just the guy to turn on the chicks and impress the 
dudes. In the more important role of Claude, whose being drafted and having to 
fight in Vietnam is central to the play, Keith Henderson gives us a glimmer of 
the inner conflict he's battling. 
</P>

Money Can't Buy You Oscar: It may not come as earth-shattering news that 
box-office success does not always equal Academy accolades. Here's a the list 
of 1989 movies that made the most in box-office receipts, and the number of 
Academy Awards they received Monday night: "Batman," $251 million, one Oscar; 
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," $196 million, one Oscar; "Lethal Weapon 
2," $147 million, none; "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," $130 million, none; "Look 
Who's Talking," $115 million, none. BETH KLEID

MIKE DOWNEY: DISCOVERING THAT THERE'S LIFE OUTSIDE BASKETBALL 
</P>

By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here, at last, is my chance to catch up on other pressing current events in the 
wide world of sports, after having been so preoccupied in recent weeks with 
matters pertaining to college basketball. So many stories, so little time. I 
feel as though life's owners have locked me out. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well. On to the headlines: 
</P>
<P>
MOOSE ATTACK DELAYS DOG RACE 
</P>
<P>
You know that big dog-sled race in Alaska, the one that-there Butcher woman 
always wins? Well, it seems a couple of her fellow sledders had some trouble 
getting to the finish line. They got attacked by a moose. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I know it must come across as pretty heartless of me to be making fun of 
somebody who had to ward off the charge of a wild animal, so let me apologize 
up front. However, goofy me, I just can't help laughing at the mere thought of 
somebody going 10 rounds with Raging Bullwinkle. 
</P>
<P>
I keep picturing an Anchorage anchorperson, saying: "Well, Wendy, some bad news 
out at the Iditarod today. Race called on account of moose." I keep picturing 
some Valdez ambulance-chaser, defending the moose on charges that he was 
intoxicated when he attacked the sled. 
</P>
<P>
I keep picturing one of the husky dogs, seeing the moose coming toward him, 
shouting: "I thought you had a lodge meeting tonight." I keep picturing the 
moose fooling the dog, distracting him by saying: "Your snowshoe's untied." 
</P>
<P>
I just hope nothing like this ever happens at the Final Four. Hate to think 
what some dumb moose would do to somebody's poor mascot. 
</P>
<P>
MAN ACCUSED OF BLACKMAILING STEINBRENNER 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, the owner of the New York Yankees is attempting to get authorities 
to believe that some guy attempted to extort a job from him. Hey, officer: I'd 
like to think the real crime here is that anybody actually wanted to work for 
George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Boss S. apparently paid this dude some serious money to do some scouting on 
outfielder Dave Winfield. You know, the usual stuff: How was Winfield spending 
his money? Who was Winfield seeing socially? The old Winfield spy rule. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same George Steinbrenner who is now one of the gentlemen (cough) 
granted the responsibility of guiding the United States Olympic team to greater 
honor and glory. We can see George now, paying some Jamaican doctor $50,000 to 
discover whether those pills Ben Johnson is popping are illegal drugs or 
Flintstone vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, you Yankee baseball players: 
</P>
<P>
Lock the owner out. 
</P>
<P>
OAKLAND RECONSIDERS RAIDER DEAL 
</P>
<P>
Here are some handy tips, to any city officials giving thought to bidding for 
the Raider football team: 
</P>
<P>
Pay your schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
Pay your firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter your homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Feed your hungry. 
</P>
<P>
This public-service message comes to you today from the Citizens to Prevent 
Professional Football From Interfering With the Quality of Human Life as We 
Know It. 
</P>
<P>
TERROR OF TENNIS IS GIRL, 13 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's finally come to this. My tennis-crazy boss is going to walk up to me 
someday soon and say: "Mike, we want you to go interview a 13-year-old girl." 
And when I ask why, he's going to look me right in the eye and say: "Because 
she's there." 
</P>
<P>
Better get my questions ready for the interview: 
</P>
<P>
"Who do you like better, Barbie or Ken?" 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think ALF will really go back to his home planet?" 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly how many Bon Jovi posters do you have in your room?" 
</P>
<P>
"What was it like, seeing your first PG-13 movie?" 
</P>
<P>
And, of course: 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want to be when you grow up?" 
</P>
<P>
It'll be my first interview ever with an athlete who can't remember the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL PITCHER GETS BURNED 
</P>
<P>
His name is Smoltz, a good name for a guy who smolders. John Smoltz, a 
22-year-old pitcher for the Atlanta Braves. Born: Detroit. Throws: Right. Bats: 
Right. Irons: Right. 
</P>
<P>
Irons? Yes. John Smoltz irons his own clothes. At least that's what he was 
doing the other day, in spring training. He was ironing his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
While he was wearing it. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, the way I understand it, Smoltz's shirt was wrinkled, so he 
picked up a hot iron and decided to smooth it right out. He proceeded to burn 
the hairs right off his chest. He's lucky the iron didn't put an iron-shaped 
hole right through him, like in a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
This is a touching story, don't you think? Here we thought baseball players 
were all so rich, they all had valets to iron their shoelaces. It takes a 
Smoltz to remind us that some baseball players do have to fend for themselves, 
and let's face it, this kid is definitely a real Smoltz. He's about the 
Smoltziest player I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, I picture the scene: World Series! Atlanta vs. the Yankees! Game 1 
starter Smoltz says to himself: "Hey, national TV! I'd better spruce myself up 
a mite!" He irons the front of his uniform! The Indian logo screams! His 
tomahawk melts! An Atlanta relief pitcher pours a bucket of Gatorade over 
Smoltz, to put out the flames! 
</P>
<P>
And promptly wins fireman of the year.

A short ride by skiff to . . . another world? 
</P>
<P>
Where seemingly endless dunes of sand ripple under the attack of near-constant 
winds. Where early morning animal tracks are everywhere, but lead nowhere since 
they are quickly erased by blowing sand.

It's a world where life of a magnificent sort fills the channel. Whales, huge

It's Magdalena Island, 600 miles south of San Diego on the Pacific side of the 
Baja California peninsula.

Few visitors ever set foot on this island, 40 miles long and looking more like 
a moonscape than a landscape. Those who do, however, don't soon forget its 
strange and unique beauty, its isolation.

It's a piece of land untouched by progress, remnants of age-old shipwrecks 
dotting its shores. 
</P>
<P>
Large frigate birds loom high in the sky, their long black wings and forked 
tails invoking thoughts of some prehistoric past. Long-eared coyotes roam and 
sniff about the tents of those who do come. They yip and yell eerily into the 
night. They make off with shoes, bottles or anything else left untethered 
overnight. By dawn, they are nowhere to be seen over the sandy expanse. 
</P>
<P>
Oversized pelicans dive-bomb the channel for fish, or rest in huge flocks under 
a sun that beats relentlessly upon the sandy shore. 
</P>
<P>
And in the channel, exhalations of whales echo in the night. The huge mammals 
slumber in the daytime sun, looking like monstrous floating rocks as they drift 
with the current. And so easygoing, they are downright approachable. 
</P>
<P>
At night, when the moon is full, it highlights surrealistic patterns painted by 
the wind across the powdery dunes. The dunes reflect the moonlight. Twilight 
seems endless. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Means got married here, he and his bride remaining on the island for a 
week. They now have a daughter. Her name is Magdalena. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Means is president of the San Diego- and La Paz-based Baja 
Expeditions, which offers guided trips here. He lives in La Paz, so coming here 
now is all in a day's work. 
</P>
<P>
But what would bring John Thaxton all the way from the concrete confines of New 
York? 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife Pat came for the kayaking and whale-watching, to escape the 
civilized world and to count species of birds in this part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We do that everywhere we go," Pat says. 
</P>
<P>
The common loon and spotted sandpiper can be seen here, as can the royal tern 
and swallow-tailed kite. Godwits, gulls and grebes are abundant. Sanderlings 
and larks abound. Then there are the loggerhead shrike, the white ibis, the 
majestic osprey . . . the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
How about that persistent peregrine falcon, chasing down the acrobatic tern 
over the middle of the channel in a dogfight just above water that lasted 
nearly a minute? 
</P>
<P>
And how could Thaxton have expected to end up carrying back to camp a nearly 
starved, sick young sea lion that had crawled high atop a blistering dune to 
die? He helped to nurse it back into a playful pup by hand-feeding it raw fish. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Rodencal and Tom Borrowman left one desert for another. But they wouldn't 
have been touching any whales in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
And here, people can touch whales. Sometimes, even when they don't mean to. The 
panga boat in which Cathleen Griffin of Portland, Me., was riding accidentally 
bumped one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all right, are you all right . . . is everybody all right?" she asked 
after the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently so. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Beckwith of Boulder, Colo.: "We hit the whale. He dove, and then came 
up alongside the boat and circled around, as if to check to see if we were all 
right. He came up along the boat and stayed there and we touched it. It was 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Peterson, also from the mountains of Boulder, said she couldn't have 
found a better place to forget about the computer business back home. 
</P>
<P>
She kayaked across the channel, gliding quietly past several 40-ton whales, 
then into the miles of tidal estuaries that mark the peninsula's shore, 
disappearing amid the thick-growing mangroves. 
</P>
<P>
A great blue heron, standing tall in the mud-flats created by the ebbing tide, 
watched her slide past. 
</P>
<P>
Loni Levy and Deborah Vogl followed basically the same route as the whales in 
coming here from their law offices in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
At least they didn't have to worry about getting tangled up in gill nets off 
the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
It is the migratory pattern of the California gray whale that is basically 
responsible for this gathering of stateside travelers, brought here as part of 
a package put together by Chuck and Judy Nichols of Nichols Expeditions of 
Moab, Utah, which works in conjunction with Baja Expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow channel between Magdalena Island and the peninsula is just one of 
several areas along the Baja coast that is frequented by gray whales, which 
travel the 6,000 miles from Alaska each year to give birth to and nurse their 
calves in Baja's warm-water lagoons. 
</P>
<P>
They play and cavort for three months, the females fattening their young with 
milk until they are fit to survive the trip north, and the icy Bering Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The channel between Magdalena Island and the peninsula is ideal for travel by 
kayak, and for close encounters with the whales, because it is narrow -- about 
a mile wide at its widest -- and generally calm. 
</P>
<P>
The whales can be seen jumping, their vast bulk causing splashes visible for 
miles. They also poke their bodies up out of the water, as if standing on their 
tails. They look around, then slip quietly back under. 
</P>
<P>
Kayakers are advised to make noise when approaching a whale, to alert the giant 
mammal of their presence. The whales generally keep their distance. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the most striking thing down here is that these animals are so 
incredibly tolerant of our intrusion," said Means' partner Kent Madin, a former 
guide and now vice president of Baja Expeditions. "If ever they wanted to do 
anybody any harm, they could. They have plenty of opportunity. And yet they 
consistently avoid any confrontation with humans." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there is reason. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular lagoon, 200 miles north of here, is the famous Scammon's, 
named after Capt. Charles Scammon, who discovered the entrance to the lagoon in 
the 1850s and, going after the valuable whale oil, turned it into a 
slaughterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The whales were also hunted at San Ignacio Lagoon, about 100 miles south of 
Scammon's by land, and even in these narrow waterways that wind through 
Magdalena Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1846 and 1874, whalers, using harpoons tipped with gunpowder charges, 
slaughtered about 10,000 whales in this 150-mile long bay alone. 
</P>
<P>
The gray whale was said to have dwindled to just a few hundred in the late 
1930s, before conservation efforts took hold. They have since come back in a 
big way, now numbering about 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 180 to 200 enter this channel each year at the Boca de la Soledad, 
its mouth, and most remain for about three months, providing ample opportunity 
for observation. Trips are booked through Baja Expeditions, the only company 
with legitimate permits to do so, according to Madin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much a nursery," Madin says of the channel during the winter 
months. "That's the main guess, that they come to a given lagoon and stay in 
that lagoon." 
</P>
<P>
Said Judy Nichols, whose company got its start down here after she had trained 
with Madin: 'It's the only place I know of where you can kayak in an area where 
you're so close to the California gray whale. You can kayak off the coast of 
Santa Barbara and San Diego (during the whales' migration) but you're not 
really that close to the whales. But here, where you have a calm channel like 
this . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Here, it is almost impossible to look out on the water and not see any whales. 
</P>
<P>
Every detail is planned for a trip billed by the Nicholses as "a time of 
discovery and tranquility surrounded by the unique environment of Magdalena 
Bay." 
</P>
<P>
It's camping in style, with meals of chicken and fish and steak prepared by the 
Mexican guides. Cakes are made from scratch and baked over hot coals in the 
sand. Baggage is transported by panga, freeing the campers to kayak from 
campsite to campsite. 
</P>
<P>
It's a world so isolated that all of the animals seem less apprehensive than 
similar species elsewhere. Pelicans seem reluctant to fly away when people 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins appear even less afraid of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
Madin recalled that on another trip, one camper customarily took a two-mile run 
at dawn along the waterline. 
</P>
<P>
"After he had started out running, a dolphin came along and swam next to him 
and paced him for the whole run," Madin said. "This dolphin was five or six 
feet away the whole way. When the runner got to the end of his run he turned 
around and came back, and the dolphin turned around and followed him. And it 
happened two mornings in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins, apparently curious, occasionally show within five or six feet of camp 
during the night. Campers can hear them breathe, and see their reflecting eyes 
focused on shore. They remain for several minutes, then move on. 
</P>
<P>
And the sea lion that John Thaxton carried back to camp? It crawled right into 
Deborah Vogl's lap, over the outstretched bodies of the other campers. 
</P>
<P>
As for the whales, just gaze out over the water, or hop aboard one of the 
pangas and you can learn firsthand of their peaceful nature. 
</P>
<P>
Guides Angel Viscaino and Juan Jesus Lucero motor out to the middle of the 
channel, and into the path of a mother whale and her calf. 
</P>
<P>
The whales continue on their course, apparently unafraid. They swim up 
alongside the boat's rail, the mother intent on keeping herself and the baby at 
what she feels is a safe distance -- a few feet. She spouts a cloud of mist 
that floats into the passengers' faces. 
</P>
<P>
They marvel, at this encounter, at the size of the mother whale and the 
proximity at which it is being viewed. They comment that the whales' skin is 
not pretty, but rather pocked by barnacles and marine growth. They remark on 
the care with which the whale treats its calf. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the mother loses any fear it might have had and begins to roll 
lazily about, well within the reach of the passengers, its calf by its side. 
</P>
<P>
Viscaino, at the boat's stern, reaches down and touches the baby, then grins 
from ear to ear, raising his hand victoriously. 
</P>
<P>
He touches it a second time and lets out a hearty laugh. Several of the 
passengers then reach over the rail and begin to pet the baby whale. It rolls 
over, perhaps appreciative of the affection, its eye staring at the smiling 
passengers. This goes on for nearly two hours before the setting sun transforms 
the horizon into a display of burning red. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of this seven-day trip is $799, not including air fare, but including two 
nights -- the first and last -- in a La Paz hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A chartered bus travels north from La Paz for four hours on Highway 1, 
affording a panoramic view of the Baja desert. Falcons and hawks fly over the 
cardon cactus and cirio trees that stand tall and thick under the blazing sun. 
</P>
<P>
Small rancheros come and go until the traffic lights of Ciudad Constitucion, 
Baja California Sur's second-most populated city, bring the bus to a stop. 
After lunch in the parking lot of a modern supermarket, it's back on the road. 
</P>
<P>
A left turn off the main highway and the farms of the Magdalena Plain, 
otherwise known as the Santo Domingo Valley, come into view. 
</P>
<P>
This arid region has been developed as an agricultural center recently, thanks 
to the tapping of water that had been trapped for centuries deep beneath the 
earth's surface. Cotton, wheat, alfalfa and vegetables are grown here and 
shipped to the Mexican mainland. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the road is the water's edge. The townspeople gather as the bus is 
unloaded. They watch as the passengers step off and sink deep into the soggy 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
As the campers board the pangas, and disappear across the channel, they leave 
behind the world they have always known, entering one they will never forget.

DUKE TRIES TO REACH THE TOP THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When players on the Duke University basketball team talk about the school's 
success in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament during the 
past five years, they don't speak in terms of a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"A legacy," senior forward Robert Brickey called it last week. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy continues this week at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, where the 
Blue Devils will play in their third straight Final Four and their fourth in 
the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, the first school since Houston to reach the NCAA tournament semifinals 
three years in a row, will meet Arkansas on Saturday. Georgia Tech plays 
Nevada-Las Vegas in the second semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
But this legacy is filled not only with remarkable achievements, but also with 
lingering frustrations. Duke has not won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Monday what he remembers most about the previous two trips, senior 
forward Alaa Abdelnaby put it succinctly. "Losing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Abdelnaby will be trying to erase the memories from Kansas City, Mo., 
and Seattle, and Duke fans also will be trying to forget Dallas in 1986, Blue 
Devils Coach Mike Krzyzewski says that this team should be judged on its merit. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, each team is different," Krzyzewski said Saturday, after the Blue 
Devils had beaten Connecticut, 79-78, in the NCAA East Regional in East 
Rutherford, N.J. "I just want to make sure we make the most of our opportunity, 
win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
This Duke team is quite different from the past three that have made the Final 
Four. In many ways, it is perhaps the biggest surprise of any of Krzyzewski's 
recent teams to have gone this far. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the Duke teams that have made it to the Final Four, this one 
has to stand out as the least likely," said Tommy Amaker, point guard on the 
1986 and 1987 Final Four teams and now an assistant coach. "It's had a lot of 
ups and downs. At times, it hasn't had the most confidence." 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that has had more distractions and controversy, on the court and 
off, than most in recent Duke history. "It's been a crazy year," Abdelnaby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There was a midseason knee injury to Brickey, a nationally publicized X-rated 
tirade by Krzyzewski directed at members of the school newspaper and 
Henderson's blowup at his teammates after Duke lost to Georgia Tech in the 
semifinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson used a few expletives to describe what he perceived as a 
Devils-might-not-care attitude of his teammates during their late-season fold. 
</P>
<P>
Asked last week about the incident, Henderson said: "What I said after Georgia 
Tech is something I've said to my teammates during the season. It's something 
that we have discussed. I'll never open up to the press like that again." 
</P>
<P>
But Henderson's message apparently woke up some of his teammates. Abdelnaby 
became a dominant force inside during the first four games of the NCAA 
tournament. Freshman point guard Bobby Hurley played more under control. And 
the whole team seemed more focused. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we played with more emotion," said Brickey, who pulled his left 
hamstring in the victory over the University of Connecticut. "I think we're 
playing as well going into the Final Four as we ever have." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Krzyzewski refuses to liken this Duke team to those of the recent 
past. If anything, the only constant has been Krzyzewski. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair to these kids," Krzyzewski said. "You don't have the same team, 
the same personalities. It's not like a pro team that goes to the Super Bowl 
three years in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Said Amaker: "The only similarity is that this team is also in the Final Four, 
but that's the most important similarity to have. It's like going to school 
after an older brother or sister. If they've done well, the teachers say, 'Why 
can't you do as well?' But this team has a chance to do something that no other 
Duke team has done." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the comparisons will be made. And the questions will be asked, 
most specifically: Is making the Final Four good enough? And, if not, when does 
catching the bouquet become tiresome? 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski will prepare his team not only for the Razorbacks but also for the 
media onslaught. He knows that this team will be reminded of the Final Four 
disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my job, to make sure they're not thinking about those teams before they 
go out to Denver," Krzyzewski said. "Why should Bobby Hurley feel that 
pressure? Why should Phil Henderson feel it? If Phil and Alaa were as good last 
year as they are now, we would have won it." 
</P>
<P>
"That's like asking someone who's made a million dollars, why haven't you made 
$2 million?" asked Henderson, one of three starters on this year's team to have 
played in two Final Fours. "It's a big achievement, and nobody should take that 
away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brickey: "There's no pressure on us to win this time. We have a goal in 
mind. We have our eye on the prize. But, as a senior, I think anything less 
(than a national championship) would give me a shallow feeling." 
</P>
<P>
And what if the Blue Devils were to win? What if Duke erased its past 
disappointments and found itself cutting down the nets at McNichols Arena come 
Monday night? Krzyzewski knows that somebody wouldn't be satisfied completely. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure if we win it, I'm going to be asked, 'When are you going to win it 
again?"' he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is probably a question Duke won't mind answering.

ABBOTT WAS EVENT; NOW HE'S A PITCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Jim Abbott made his Angel debut in a B game here a year ago, he was 
deluged by reporters eager to chronicle the improbable story of the kid who won 
an Olympic gold medal and was trying to make the major leagues despite having 
been born without a right hand. 
</P>
<P>
He received a standing ovation and was obliged to hold a news conference to 
accommodate the curious, a chore he repeated countless times during his rookie 
season. 
</P>
<P>
When Abbott made his 1990 debut Tuesday, he was greeted with polite applause 
from the crowd of 2,433 at Desert Sun Stadium. He had no cameras to fend off 
and few interviews to grant. But if the fuss has subsided, that's fine with 
him, because now he can concentrate on learning more about the craft he 
practiced so impressively in his 12-12 rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
"I said last year I'd like to get the attention out of the way," the 
22-year-old Michigan native said. "I just want to work hard and be prepared and 
hopefully I can make a nice career, quietly. I know I'll always get attention. 
That's part of it. When attention comes, I'll accept it when it's due and 
downplay it when it's not." 
</P>
<P>
He accepted his rocky first exhibition outing Tuesday with equanimity. Abbott 
went two innings, giving up three walks and a two-run home run to San Diego's 
Mike Pagliarulo over the 385-foot sign in right-center. Abbott didn't figure in 
the decision, an 8-6 victory by the Angels that evened their exhibition record 
at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't especially sharp, but my arm felt good and live," Abbott said. "All I 
was trying to do was get into my rhythm. I didn't have it today, but this was a 
good starting point. The first time out is always a little weird. You try to be 
too perfect after a week of practice and obviously you're not going to have the 
same result as if you had more time behind you. You have to play it smart and 
reserved, and take that attitude into the season." 
</P>
<P>
He also hopes to take with him into the season a changeup, which would 
complement his standbys of last season, the explosive fastball, which hitters 
found difficult to pick up, and the darting slider. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't throw any changes today," he said. "I would have liked to, but I was 
behind in the count too much. I'll probably try it next time out. All the other 
pitches are coming along." 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish expects Abbott to master the changeup as easily as Abbott 
mastered the other challenges he faced last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed with him from the first, just because of what he had to deal 
with," Parrish said. "It went like that the whole season, although it tapered 
off toward the end. You take a guy who comes right out of college and makes the 
major leagues, that's a tremendous adjustment, with all the pressure and 
expectations. Then you put him in a situation where he's constantly sought out 
by the media. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to give so much of himself. Most of us would have gone crazy, but he 
always made himself available. I never saw him lose his temper. He was very 
gracious. The bottom line is that he was still able to go about his business 
and do his job as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the ability to make the adjustment from college to . . . major league 
hitters in a short time and be effective with his knowledge of hitters and his 
ability to set people up. He was amazing. He had a chance to win more games 
than he did. We just didn't play that well for him. I expect it's possible 
he'll do even better this season." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott expects more from himself this season than last, and his goals include 
15 victories and more success against left-handed hitters. Lefties hit .325 
against him, compared with the .263 hit by right-handed hitters. "I think, as a 
staff, we can win 75 games and I want to hold up my end," Abbott said. "I'd 
like to win more than 15, but that's something to shoot for. . . . Doing better 
against lefties is something I'm working on, but I don't see that many lefties. 
I just need to throw some different pitches I don't throw very often to 
right-handers and work on that." 
</P>
<P>
He can work on it, he said, with an attitude that is untainted by his 
disappointment over having the Angels renew his contract for $185,000. Whether 
that might persuade him some day to become a free agent is something he won't 
contemplate now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something that I want to carry along with me," he said. "It's 
negative space that I try to put aside. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about this season. This is a good team and we have a good chance 
to do well this year. I really enjoy the camaraderie here and I'd hate to carry 
something over from the off-season. If I'm fortunate to have a career that 
lasts that long, I'll cross that bridge (free agency) when I come to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm just worried about this season. Some guys have had a lot more 
promising starts than I have and have had their career go astray. You never 
know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I'm just going to keep working 
because I don't want that to happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starter Kirk McCaskill worked three solid innings Tuesday and left with a 2-1 
lead. He allowed one run and three hits, walked one and struck out two. 
McCaskill said he doesn't feel pressure to succeed because of the trade rumors 
that mention his name. "It affected me until the winter meetings and a little 
after," he said. "But eventually I realized it's worthless to try and 
speculate. Right now I'm just concentrating on getting ready and looking 
forward to pitching with the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish sat out the game because of a pulled muscle in his upper 
back. John Orton replaced Parrish in the regular game and contributed a two-run 
home run to center in the fifth inning. Parrish's status is day to day. Two 
other starters are out with injuries -- shortstop Dick Schofield (pulled 
hamstring) and center fielder Devon White (strained quadriceps). Outfielder Dan 
Grunhard, taking over for White in the starting lineup, hit the game-winning, 
three-run homer in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the seven-inning preliminary game Tuesday, the Angel B team defeated the 
Padre B team, 1-0. Brian Downing's fifth-inning single scored Kent Anderson. . 
. . Pitcher Mike Erb suffered a bruised left shin when he was struck on the leg 
by a line drive hit by Garry Templeton in the B game. X-rays showed no breaks. 
Facing two games with his reduced roster, Manager Doug Rader rotated Anderson, 
Donnie Hill and Mark McLemore at second base, shortstop and third base in the B 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven, Scott Bailes, Mike Smithson, Mark Clear and Mark Eichhorn are 
scheduled to pitch for the Angels today. Set to work Thursday are Chuck Finley, 
Greg Minton, Rich Monteleone, Bob McClure and Bryan Harvey.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
Not since the 1954 World Series had I looked forward to watching an 
Indian-Giant game as much as the one Monday afternoon in Scottsdale, Ariz. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
There may not have been anything to match Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder catch 
at the Polo Grounds, but the delayed start of ESPN's major league baseball 
telecasts was worth the wait. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel, at about 250 pounds, looked to be in midseason shape. It was 
strange seeing Dave Anderson bleed Giant orange. In the third inning, somebody 
yelled, "Bear 0down!" In his second at-bat as a Giant, Gary Carter got the 
game-winning hit. And analyst Norm Hitzges revealed that Cleveland newcomer 
Dion James didn't change underwear during a 15-game hitting streak with Atlanta 
last year. How great to have the national pastime back. . . . 
</P>
<P>
ESPN's announcers are the only people I've ever seen wearing coats and ties at 
a spring training game in Arizona. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The new short men in baseball are the starters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I hope Dodger outfielder John Shelby hasn't already used up his year's supply 
of RBIs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Did it ever occur to the Coliseum Commission to agree to lease the stadium to 
MCA/Spectacor before, not after, Oakland made a commitment to bring the Raiders 
back? . . . 
</P>
<P>
You won't be able to get a legal bet down on the NCAA semifinal game between 
Nevada Las Vegas and Georgia Tech because Nevada law prohibits wagering on 
athletic events involving in-state schools. But the sports books will have 
saved themselves big money if UNLV wins the tournament. The Runnin' Rebels 
would have been prohibitive favorites in their hometown. . . . Best player in 
the Final Four whom nobody knows is Arkansas forward Lenzie Howell. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Parkhill of Penn State, Mike Montgomery of Stanford and Pete Gillen of 
Xavier are the finalists to succeed Terry Holland as basketball coach at 
Virginia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What Larry Johnson has accomplished in the tournament thus far will count in 
the voting for the John Wooden Award. Include the Regionals, and I think you've 
got to rank the Nevada Las Vegas forward over La Salle's Lionel Simmons and 
Oregon State's Gary Payton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A new basketball power is the Southwest Conference, and it will stay that way 
if Texas keeps Coach Tom Penders. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New York Knick Coach Stu Jackson is really in trouble now that General Manager 
Al Bianchi has given him a vote of confidence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Carl Scheer -- formerly Continental Basketball Assn. commissioner and an 
executive with the Carolina Cougars, Denver Nuggets, Clippers and Charlotte 
Hornets and now back with the Nuggets -- changes jobs as often as his good 
friend, Larry Brown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson and actor Michael Douglas will be working for scale after the 
Laker-Clipper game tonight at the Sports Arena when they tape a segment of "The 
Earth Day Special," to be shown on ABC April 22. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Helmut Kohl and Pete Axthelm. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bob Arum is promoting a rare doubleheader at Caesars Tahoe Sunday featuring 
unbeaten junior flyweight Michael Carbajal at 10:30 a.m. on NBC and unbeaten 
light heavyweight Andrew Maynard at 6 p.m. on ESPN. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look for Santa Anita and Hollywood Park to stage a bidding war for Trevor 
Denman's services when the track announcer's contract with Santa Anita runs out 
late next year. Denman is to horse racing in Southern California what Vin 
Scully is to baseball and Chick Hearn is to basketball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will go the John Thompson route for the first round of the NHL 
playoffs, headquartering in Banff for games that will be played a two-hour 
drive away in Calgary. . . . Billy Crystal, the laugh riot of the Academy 
Awards show, is no joke as a shortstop in celebrity games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The field for the Volvo tennis tournament July 28-Aug. 5 at UCLA already is 
stacking up better than those in most of L.A.'s tournaments in recent years. 
Stefan Edberg is the latest entrant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best wishes for a speedy recovery to Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers' 
Spanish-speaking broadcaster who was injured in an auto accident in Vero Beach, 
Fla. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Calvin Holmes and wide receiver Travis Hannah will participate in 
the scrimmage that closes spring practice for USC Friday, and then fly to Palo 
Alto to run on the Trojans' mile relay team in an invitational Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Ricky Ervins will be featured on the Trojans' 1990 football posters 
and pocket schedules. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of George Allen already is paying off for Cal State Long Beach, 
which expects to raise $100,000 for its football program with a "Long Beach 
Welcomes George Allen" dinner May 23 at the Spruce Goose. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is the extra revenue that Jerry Buss will reap from additional Forum senate 
seats worth all the ill will the move has created?

MELVIN DURSLAG: HE EMBODIES ISLAND'S DEVOTION TO BASEBALL

<P>
By a rule of United States immigration authorities, no team in major league 
baseball can employ in its minor league system more than 24 foreign players at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't spelled out specifically why such a rule has been implemented, but the 
general feeling is it is there to protect the American worker. 
</P>
<P>
Just about every big league club has filled its quota, no surprise to Mr. Juan 
Samuel of San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic, who informs you that 
entertainers from his land alone could occupy all the spots that immigration 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, known among confederates as "Sammy," rolled out of the Dominican in 
1980 to take a place at the Philadelphia farm station in Bend, Ore., where, 
unable to read a menu in English, he confesses he ordered fried chicken every 
day for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this harks back to the great immigration at the turn of the century, 
when Italians and Hungarians debarking ordered corn flakes for the same reason 
Samuel ordered fried chicken. 
</P>
<P>
From what you might call a fowl beginning, Samuel would advance to a wage of 
roughly $1 million a year, the sum the Dodgers are paying him to play center 
field, a location he doesn't relish. 
</P>
<P>
Juan is partial to second base, but agrees to center field because of the 
charity in his heart and because the job pays a million bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Samuel, other Dominicans on the Dodgers' big league roster are Alfredo 
Griffin, Ramon Martinez, Jose Gonzalez, Jose Offerman and Barulio Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
And only recently, they have dealt off Dominican noblemen Pedro Guerrero, 
Alejandro Pena and Mariano Duncan, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"People are a little shocked to see all these players coming out of the 
Dominican today," says Samuel, "but it's nothing special. The players have been 
there for years. It's only recently (that) clubs have gone after them in a 
serious way." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Samuel counted, 20 teams in the majors were running full-scale 
programs in the Dominican Republic, mining for talent that comes (a) outside 
the draft and (b) cheap. 
</P>
<P>
The year around, in a village called Las Palmas, the Dodgers sponsor a live-in 
camp accommodating 70 prospects at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"You would call it costly," Executive Vice President Fred Claire explains, 
"until you consider the whole operation runs less a year than the salary of 
just one big-time major league player." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel describes his history as garden-variety. He grew up in a family of seven 
children, from which the old man, now deceased, fled. The mother operated a 
small clothing store from which she earned enough to support her brood in a 
three-bedroom house where the four boys occupied one room, the three girls 
another and the mother the third. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until he came to this country that Juan discovered the luxury of 
sleeping alone. At home, the four brothers slept in two beds. 
</P>
<P>
"San Pedro de Macoris is sugar cane country," Samuel says. "And every factory 
sponsors a baseball team. The teams play tournaments the year around. And the 
kids dream of playing one day in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I was never connected with sugar cane. I had a gentleman's job in 
a pants factory, operating a machine that cut cloth for jeans. Our factory, 
too, sponsored a team. I worked the overnight shift from 10 until 6:30 in the 
morning. I would sleep, go out and play baseball and report for work." 
</P>
<P>
It develops one day that Samuel, then 18, gets a visit from a Philly scout, who 
wants to give him a tryout. "The only trouble," Samuel recalls, "is that he 
wants to try me out at 9 in the morning. Without sleep, I was afraid I wouldn't 
be sharp, but I didn't want to cancel the tryout for fear I would never get 
another. I also was afraid to skip work for fear I would get fired." 
</P>
<P>
The devastating dilemma of this young man is solved by his brother Carlos, a 
foreman in the factory. 
</P>
<P>
"Carlos reports me as sick," says Juan. 
</P>
<P>
To condense a long and painful account, the scout signs Samuel, slipping him a 
check for $2,500. That was more than he earned at the pants factory in 2 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"My poor mother broke into tears," he says. "She ran to the neighbors, telling 
them her son was a success. The whole island is on fire with kids who play 
baseball. They play day and night, the year around. The majors now know they 
are there. They will take as many as the law allows." 
</P>
<P>
The chronology can be interesting. You never know when yesterday's pants cutter 
will be today's center fielder.

<P>
MAKAROV'S SUCCESS STIRS DEBATE: CAN AN OLD FLAME BE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dictionary defines rookie as a novice. 
</P>
<P>
In sports, a rookie has always been defined as a first-year player. But not 
necessarily this season in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
There, the term is being redefined in sometimes furious debates that have 
spread over two countries. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the controversy is Sergei Makarov, right wing of the Calgary 
Flames. 
</P>
<P>
His numbers -- 22 goals and 58 assists for a total of 80 points in 76 games -- 
make him the leading candidate for the Calder Trophy, annually awarded to the 
league's top rookie. The winner is selected by the Professional Hockey Writers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Makarov's closest pursuer is Mike Modano of the Minnesota North Stars with 73 
points. Darren Turcotte of the New York Rangers leads all rookies with 31 goals 
but has only 63 points. Other contenders are Mark Recchi of the Pittsburgh 
Penguins, with 30 goals and 65 points, and Jeremy Roenick of the Chicago 
Blackhawks, with 63 points. 
</P>
<P>
But those numbers are not the issue here. The only relevant number seems to be 
31. 
</P>
<P>
That's Makarov's age. 
</P>
<P>
He is a veteran of more than a decade with one of the world's top hockey units, 
the Soviet Army team. 
</P>
<P>
Makarov is the most successful of the eight Soviet players who have joined the 
NHL in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
After playing two seasons with his hometown club, Tracktor Chelyabinsk, Makarov 
spent 11 seasons with the Central Red Army team. Each of those years, his club 
won the Soviet National League title, and he made the all-star team. He won the 
league scoring title nine of the last 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Makarov has also played in three Winter Olympics and nine World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in 275 games for the Soviets, scoring 323 points on 173 goals and 
150 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive numbers? Too impressive for many reporters and coaches around the 
league who insist Makarov shouldn't qualify for consideration as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Too old and too experienced, they say. It's not fair to the true rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Since when has age been a criterion for rookies in any league? 
</P>
<P>
There are cases like the Kings' backup goalie, Ron Scott. At 29, he is finally 
getting a chance to play after spending six years wasting away in the New York 
Rangers' organization. Should someone be penalized because no team recognized 
his talent earlier? 
</P>
<P>
The other argument is the experience factor. Because Makarov has competed at 
the top level of amateur hockey, that somehow disqualifies him from being 
considered a novice pro. 
</P>
<P>
By that reasoning, David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, considered a lock 
to be NBA rookie of the year, should be denied that award because he competed 
on the U.S. Olympic team, the top level of amateur basketball competition for 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
According to league rules, the Calder Trophy is to be awarded "to the player 
selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition in the 
National Hockey League." 
</P>
<P>
Clear and simple. 
</P>
<P>
To set up additional restrictions handicaps not only Makarov, but countless 
others in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a way to San Jose? The hockey situations in Minnesota and San Jose 
seem on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, owners George and Gordon Gund have threatened to move their North 
Stars to the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
In San Jose, former Hartford Whaler owner and WHA President Howard Baldwin is 
negotiating to land an expansion franchise for that city. 
</P>
<P>
"We are virtually on the edge," he said in describing his bid to get a lease on 
the $100-million arena planned for San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The next step would be to apply to the league for an expansion franchise. That 
would appear to be a formality since most NHL owners consider another West 
Coast team a must. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the North Stars? The Bay Area cannot support two hockey clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The most logical thing would be for the Gunds to sell their team to a Minnesota 
group and for Baldwin to get his San Jose expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
But here's a new scenario: Baldwin buys the North Stars, keeps them in 
Minnesota, and the Gunds get the expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy? Baldwin, who arrived in Minnesota Tuesday, wouldn't rule it out. "We're 
trying to figure out a solution," he said. "But let me say that any solution 
that does not include San Jose is unacceptable. I have made a commitment to San 
Jose and I intend to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin already has stated a willingness to meet the NHL's asking price of $50 
million for an expansion team. If the Gunds moved to the Bay Area, would the 
league be out that money? 
</P>
<P>
"If they are going to transfer," King owner Bruce McNall said, "in my mind, we 
should still get the amount we would have normally got ($50 million). Why would 
the league take less?" 
</P>
<P>
The Gunds have no intention of paying the league $50 million to go to the Bay 
Area. If they insist on moving rather than selling, the league could fight it 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
Or the NHL could award the expansion team to Minnesota, perhaps with Baldwin 
heading the group, and get the $50 million that way. 
</P>
<P>
To Baldwin, it's simple. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't feel you move franchises around like you move pieces of luggage."

RANGERS WIN FIRST DIVISION TITLE SINCE '42

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Rangers were the hottest team in the NHL during the first month of 
the season, then plunged to the bottom of the Patrick Division in early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the Rangers clinched their first division championship in 48 
years with a 7-4 victory over the Quebec Nordiques at Quebec City. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers, whose last title came in 1941-42 when the NHL was a seven-team 
league, rallied for five third-period goals in less than 10 minutes against the 
Nordiques, the league's worst team. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the season, we had just hoped to make the playoffs," said 
Ranger Coach Roger Neilson, who got the job less than a month before training 
camp began in September. "But when we got to Christmas and no one had run away, 
we knew we'd have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 6, Detroit 5 -- Dave Andreychuk scored three times during a five-goal 
first period at Detroit as the Sabres eliminated the Red Wings from playoff 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings, two-time defending Norris Division champions, missed the 
playoffs for the first time since 1985-86 and for the first time in Jacques 
Demers' four years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 4, Washington 1 -- Kirk Muller and Dave Maley scored during a 1:12 
span midway through the first period at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Devils 
prevented the Capitals from clinching a playoff spot and assured themselves of 
finishing no worse than third in the Patrick Division -- their best finish 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 4, New York Islanders 2 -- Theoren Fleury scored the tiebreaking goal 
late in the second period at Uniondale, N.Y., as the Flames ended a three-game 
losing streak and sent the Islanders to the brink of playoff elimination. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders must win their two remaining games and the Pittsburgh Penguins 
must lose two for New York to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 3, Pittsburgh 3 -- Yvon Corriveau and Adam Burt scored for the Whalers 
in the third period at Pittsburgh, extending the Penguins' winless streak to 
six games. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 3, St. Louis 0 -- Reggie Lemelin made 33 saves at St. Louis as the 
Bruins handed the Blues their sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 4, Vancouver 1 -- Oiler goaltender Bill Ranford tuned up for the 
playoffs by turning aside 31 shots at Vancouver.

MAJOR LEAGUE UMPIRES WILL RETURN TO SPRING TRAINING GAMES FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major league umpires will report to work Friday, ending a weeklong boycott of 
spring training games while their labor dispute goes to binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
The umpires' union and league presidents agreed Tuesday to let a retired 
Philadelphia judge resolve their differences, including whether umpires should 
be paid for spring games canceled during the owners' 32-day lockout. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted to see the umpires go back to work," union director Richie 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached under the prodding of U.S. District Judge Norma L. 
Shapiro of Philadelphia, who was scheduled to hear arguments in the leagues' 
request for an injunction forcing the umpires to work. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the sides met for several hours, then emerged, saying that retired 
Common Pleas Judge Stanley Greenburg would decide the issues, starting with a 
hearing today.

PREP PLAYER STRIKES OUT 20 IN 7 INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ryan McGuire, a senior left-hander from Woodland Hills El Camino Real High, 
struck out 20 batters in a regulation, seven-inning baseball game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, a 6-foot-2 left-hander, threw a five-hitter, walked one and allowed 
one earned run as El Camino Real defeated Reseda Cleveland, 7-2. McGuire, who 
struck out 18 in a nine-inning game in his most recent start last Tuesday, 
retired the first batter on a ground ball to second before getting the next 20 
outs on strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The state record for a seven-inning game was set in 1973 by Jim Peterson of La 
Habra Sonora. Peterson struck out 22, with one batter reaching base on a passed 
ball by the catcher.

CRESPI DUO HELPS BEDEVIL LOYOLA, 8-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Figuring out Crespi High's pitching combination of Rick Marino and Pat Bennett 
can be tricky. The trouble lies in making the adjustment from Marino's 
over-the-top delivery to Bennett's side-armed sling. 
</P>
<P>
Call the one-two punch Marino and Submarino. 
</P>
<P>
The duo combined for a three-hitter as Crespi defeated Loyola, 8-3, on Tuesday 
in a Del Rey League game at Valley College. Marino started and Bennett replaced 
him in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Both guys were throwing a little harder today" than usual, Celts Coach Scott 
Muckey said. "Hopefully, that trend will continue. I thought they were both 
pretty sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Crisp pitching is not what struggling Loyola wanted to see. The Lions (2-6-1, 
0-4) averaged 12 runs a game before league play began, but have scored just six 
runs against four Del Rey League opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola loaded the bases with no outs in the first inning, but Marino got Crespi 
out of the jam by striking out David Vida and enticing the next batter, Brian 
Dennis, to hit into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (7-3-1, 3-1) answered in the bottom half of the first, batting around 
while pounding six of its 11 hits and scoring six runs. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Walsh and Tim Weir both hit two-run singles; Mark Venturine, Mark 
Maurizi, Victor Seper and Mike Peters also singled. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey wasn't comfortable even after taking the commanding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were playing catch-up ball the whole game," he said, smiling. 
"They've got some guys who can power the ball and there was no reason they 
couldn't do that to us."

MCGUIRE STRIKES OUT 20 CLEVELAND BATTERS FOR EL CAMINO REAL; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASEBALL: SENIOR PERFECTS PITCHING MOTION AND DELIVERS A STYLISH 
PERFORMANCE IN 7-2 WIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The way El Camino Real High left-hander Ryan McGuire tells it, before he made a 
recent alteration in his delivery, his throwing motion wasn't exactly state of 
the art. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it wasn't stately at all. McGuire, primarily a first baseman, says his 
arm's range of motion was constricted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird," said McGuire with a shake of the head. "Before this, I've been 
pitching like an infielder throwing B. P. (batting practice)." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire's delivery -- and performance -- was close to perfect Tuesday as the 
senior struck out 20 to lead El Camino Real to a 7-2 Northwest Valley 
Conference victory over host Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, 20. McGuire (6-foot-2, 190 pounds) threw a five-hitter, walked 
one and struck out the side in the second through seventh innings, allowing 
only a pair of tainted runs. In his last 16 innings, McGuire (2-0) has, count 
'em, 38 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, Ryan did an excellent job," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said. "What 
words do you use when a kid pitches like that?" 
</P>
<P>
If you're the umpire, try stee-rike. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire's steamrolling of Cleveland came close to the state record for 
strikeouts in a seven-inning game. In 1973, Jim Peterson of La Habra Sonora 
struck out 22 -- one batter reached base on a passed ball. Recent area highs in 
a seven-inning game include 20 strikeouts by Bill Ronquillo of Royal in 1982 
and 18 by Scott Radinsky of Simi Valley in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Things seemed normal enough when Cleveland leadoff hitter Brian Basowski 
grounded out to second baseman Herman Merchan. But the next 20 outs were 
recorded via McGuire's bulky left arm. 
</P>
<P>
There were two shoulda-been outs that, because of defensive blackouts, were 
never recorded. One ball fell in front of El Camino Real outfielder Jason Cohen 
in the first, allowing Cleveland (2-4, 2-4 in league play) to take a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Conquistadores (5-0-1, 5-0-1) scored twice in the fifth to take a 
3-2 lead, then tacked on four more in the sixth, Cohen felt better. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I did (McGuire) a favor," Cohen said with a grin. "He got to strike 
another guy out." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Castillo did McGuire a similar turn in right field. In the third, 
Castillo dropped a liner by Pat Bryant for an error, allowing an unearned run. 
McGuire again struck out the side. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire admitted that the umpire's strike zone, which at times seemed about as 
wide as the backstop, helped cut down on the walks. Entering the game, McGuire 
has walked 16 in 14 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Who wouldn't like a strike zone like that?" McGuire said. "He gave me a couple 
(of calls) that helped me out in tight situations." 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the seventh, the El Camino Real bench was openly rooting for 
McGuire to strike out the side to reach 20. In fact, when the first batter, Rob 
Kosakoski, was ruled safe at first after narrowly beating out an 0-and-2 nubber 
to third, nobody seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, who will attend UCLA next season, struck out the next three batters -- 
on 12 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, regarded more as a hitter, has opened some eyes. And reopened a few 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan, to be honest, was to recruit him as a first baseman and to maybe use 
him some in relief," said UCLA baseball Coach Gary Adams, who witnessed 
McGuire's 18-strikeout performance last week against Granada Hills. "But when a 
kid is pitching like this, to put it bluntly, you have to keep an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
Has McGuire ever been better? 
</P>
<P>
"With 20 Ks," said catcher Bobby Kim, "it's the best I've ever seen in my 
life."

SAN FERNANDO WALKS OFF WITH WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Chatsworth High's Reed McMackin put his team in a bind Tuesday when he walked 
San Fernando's first seven batters. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin (3-2) was removed after the seventh walk and San Fernando went on to 
score six runs in the inning en route to an easy, 9-2 Northwest Valley 
Conference victory at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The game was called after six innings because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth (8-3, 3-3 in conference play) used four different pitchers -- 
McMackin, Dennis Emslie, Brett Thompson and Mitch Root -- but none could shut 
down the Tigers (8-1-1, 5-1). 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando's John Najar (3-0), a senior right-hander, threw a one-hitter and 
hit his sixth home run in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"To still pitch as terrible as I did and only allow one hit was amazing to me," 
said Najar. "The mound here is sloped, and I was throwing a lot of sidearm 
pitches. It wasn't pretty." 
</P>
<P>
Najar hit five Chatsworth batters, but his fastball was effective enough to 
keep the Chancellors throwing their helmets in disgust. ERIC SHEPARD

JAMES FLANIGAN: SOVIETS WOULD PAY FOR GUNFIRE IN LITHUANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's the connection between Soviet soldiers in Lithuania and bankers in 
Frankfurt, London, Tokyo and New York? Simply this: The bankers may be the most 
effective restraint on the troops, because if the Soviet army takes to shooting 
Lithuanians, the Soviet Union can kiss its credit rating and its economy 
goodby. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has been borrowing heavily -- $6 billion last year and $6 
billion in 1988 -- and it now owes $49 billion to Western banks. That's not 
excessive for a big economy, and the amounts Moscow must pay annually in 
principal and interest are still at affordable levels, says Keith Savard of the 
Institute of International Finance -- a Washington-based credit research agency 
for international banks. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that the Soviets have been borrowing to import consumer goods -- 
trying to put something in the shops to quell popular complaints -- is worrying 
Western bankers. Consumer goods are not capital goods -- machines that produce 
exports, enabling the Soviet Union to pay back the loans. The current Soviet 
pattern reminds bankers uncomfortably of Latin America in the 1970s, when many 
countries borrowed to subsidize the price of food for their people. Once the 
meal was eaten there was nothing to pay back debt. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the bankers' concern is that the Soviets are beginning to be late 
with interest payments. Explanations that administrative upsets of glasnost and 
perestroika are to blame for late payment sound to creditors suspiciously like 
"the check is in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
Against that background, violence in Vilnius would chill Soviet chances for 
further loans, just as the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 halted Soviet access 
to Western capital markets. And that would spell the end of perestroika, the 
program of economic and political change that is about to enter a critical 
period. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, according to word out of Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
and his economic lieutenants will launch a massive shift to a free market 
economy. They will privatize state companies by selling shares to the Soviet 
public, liberalize prices in an attempt to get supply and demand working and 
move rapidly toward making the ruble convertible -- a necessary step if the 
Soviet Union is to join the international economy. 
</P>
<P>
But doing all that will need Western financing, since the ruble right now is a 
virtually useless currency -- pegged officially at $1.61 but trading between a 
special tourist rate of 16 cents and a black market rate of 6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the "Soviets can afford a crisis less today than they ever could," says 
Alan Stoga, chief economist of Kissinger Associates, a New York consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet economy is in worse shape than studies over the years have pictured 
it. A new book, "The Impoverished Superpower," edited by Charles Wolf Jr. of 
RAND Corp. and Henry S. Rowen of Stanford Business School, reveals that the 
Soviets have been devoting more than one-fourth of their economy to military 
spending (compared to less than 6% for the United States). Furthermore, the 
Soviet economy may be smaller than previously thought -- only a third or less 
the size of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, it's an economy that would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. 
Soviet economists acknowledge that in agriculture, up to half of the total crop 
is lost through waste -- from lack of storage to sloppy work. And so the 
Soviets must pay scarce hard currency to buy U.S. grain -- although lately 
they've been buying on credit where they used to buy for cash. 
</P>
<P>
The signals all point the same way: The Soviets need money. So much so that 
Thomas H. Naylor of Duke University, author of "The Gorbachev Strategy," says 
that the Soviet leader's ultimate aim is to reap hard currency from the West in 
exchange for granting Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia independence. "Gorbachev 
asked Lithuania for $33 billion in compensation -- an opening bid for 
bargaining," says Naylor. "But he knows Lithuania has no money; he's really 
looking for some sort of payment from the West, whether delivered through banks 
or governments." 
</P>
<P>
Why should Gorbachev get any kind of compensation? Ostensibly for Soviet state 
property in Lithuania and to relocate ethnic Russians. In Naylor's scenario, 
Gorbachev doesn't oppose self-determination for Lithuanians and other ethnic 
minorities. It is historical fact, after all, that such self-determination was 
granted by Lenin himself. Gorbachev just wants to make a much needed buck out 
of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
And while most Soviet experts don't think, as Naylor does, that Gorbachev wants 
to "sell" other Soviet republics such as Georgia and Armenia, they do see 
possibilities in the Baltic states. "We should make clear we do not condone any 
violence," says Wolf of RAND Corp., the Santa Monica research firm that often 
works for the U.S. government. "But if a $10-billion investment would get 
independence for Lithuania, that's not a bad price." 
</P>
<P>
So for all the threats from Moscow and tanks in Vilnius, Lithuania comes down 
to a simple equation: Either Gorbachev keeps a tight rein on his soldiers, or 
he can watch the Soviet economy continue to die.

TIME WARNER INC. TO PAY $225 MILLION FOR PUBLISHER OF SUNSET MAGAZINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of Sunset magazine, which has set the tone for Western living with 
stories ranging from cooking tips to conserving wilderness, said Tuesday that 
they had agreed to sell their publishing company to Time Warner Inc. for about 
$225 million. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will end more than six decades of Lane family control of the 
monthly magazine, which was originally founded by the Southern Pacific Railroad 
in 1898 as a publicity tool to encourage travel to the West. 
</P>
<P>
L. W. (Bill) Lane Jr. and Melvin B. Lane, co-chairman of Lane Publishing Co., 
which owns Sunset, began looking for a buyer last fall to ensure that the Menlo 
Park, Calif.-based company's future and finance its growth, said spokesman Gene 
Elsbree. "The important consideration is that Bill is 70 and Mel is 67," said 
Elsbree of the brothers. "They have devoted their lifetimes to building Sunset 
and they were concerned about its future." 
</P>
<P>
Elsbree said that none of Lane's five grown children, who are stockholders and 
approved the sale, were prepared to take over leadership of the company. "None 
of them have the experience to take over a senior management position." 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Time Warner, which will pay $80 million in cash and $145 million 
in preferred stock for Lane, says it plans no major changes in management or 
editorial content of Sunset, which has a circulation of 1.4 million. The Lane 
brothers will serve as consultants to Time Warner after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a great deal of potential there," said Time spokesman Peter Costiglio. 
"We are really looking to have it grow even more." 
</P>
<P>
The Lane's decision to sell to Time might have been influenced by a longtime 
relationship with the company, which ranks as the world's largest media and 
entertainment company after merging with Warner Communications last year. 
</P>
<P>
L. W. Lane Sr., who bought Sunset in 1928 after moving to California to open an 
office for Better Homes &amp; Gardens, had been good friends with Time magazine 
founder Henry Luce. Sunset and the West Coast edition of Time also share 
printing presses. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the Lane brothers announced their decision to a group of 
300 employees at Sunset's 16-acre headquarters complex, where adobe-walled 
office buildings are set amid gardens representing the West's deserts as well 
as its coastal forests. 
</P>
<P>
"Our highest priorities have always been to maintain Sunset's editorial 
excellence, to continue its growth and to ensure that the future of Sunset is 
in the right hands," the Lanes said in a statement. "We're confident that these 
will now be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to buy Sunset completes Time's plan to own regional magazines in 
the growing Sunbelt region. Five years ago, Time bought Southern Progress 
Corp., which publishes Southern Living magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunset magazine is a particularly attractive and vibrant property in a part of 
the country of growing importance to our company," said Time Warner President 
Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In buying Sunset, Time gains a name widely recognized in 13 Western states. The 
magazine was one of the first to tailor its editorial content to separate 
regions within its circulation area, and it is now published in four regional 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the magazine, Lane also publishes the widely popular Sunset Books -- on 
gardening, home repair, cooking and other subjects -- and produces Sunset 
Films. 
</P>
<P>
Sales and profit figures for Lane Publishing were not released. But in a 1984 
interview, William Lane said the company then had $80 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset has focused its attention on five areas -- travel and recreation, home 
design, food and entertainment, gardening and the environment -- and has proved 
to be quite an influence on its readers. 
</P>

TWO BIG SHAREHOLDERS OF LOCKHEED SAY THEY VOTED WITH SIMMONS; 
</P>
<P>
PROXY FIGHT: OTHER INSTITUTIONS MAY JOIN THE PENSION FUND MANAGERS IN FAVORING 
THE DISSIDENT GROUP TRYING TO UNSEAT THE DEFENSE CONTRACTOR'S BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two of Lockheed Corp.'s institutional shareholders said Tuesday that they had 
voted their shares in favor of a dissident slate of directors led by Harold C. 
Simmons, the Texas financier who is waging a proxy fight to take control of the 
nation's sixth-largest defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
As both sides struggled for shareholder votes, two state pension fund managers 
-- the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the Florida State 
Board of Administration -- disclosed their support for Simmons' slate. 
Together, the two institutions control about 1.1% of Lockheed's stock. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, informed sources said at least four other institutional investors 
are planning to support Simmons' slate, bringing another 1.7% of the voting 
shares to the rival faction. The core of Simmons' strength in the contest is 
the 18.9% of Lockheed stock owned by NL Industries, a Houston chemical company 
he controls. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons needs a majority of the shares voted to gain the election of his slate 
of director candidates and, thus, control of Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
Proxy fights for board seats are rare, and victories by dissident board slates 
are rarer still. Simmons was given little chance to unseat the Lockheed board 
when he launched his proxy fight last month. However, he now appears poised to 
mount a respectable challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The issue will be decided this week, but it is likely that results will not be 
announced at Lockheed's annual meeting Thursday, as had been expected earlier. 
It was learned that the large number of late votes -- and the vote switches 
that will be possible through the annual meeting -- could mean that the results 
won't be known for as much as two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A manager of Florida state's pension fund, Luther Jones, said he has already 
voted his organization's 210,000 Lockheed shares -- about 0.3% of the total -- 
in favor of the Simmons slate. Jones said he supports Simmons because of the 
way he has said he would manage the company. Simmons has criticized Lockheed's 
diversification efforts, contending that the Calabasas firm should focus more 
on its core businesses of aerospace and defense contracting. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons has also said he would put operations in two Lockheed divisions -- 
electronic systems and technology services -- up for sale if he could not 
quickly make them more profitable. "What he has put forward is in the best 
interest of the shareholders," Jones said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said his fund is also supporting the dissident slate because Simmons has 
supported certain shareholder rights proposals that will be voted on at the 
annual meeting. Among the proposals is one that would eliminate Lockheed's 
anti-takeover "poison pill" defenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida pension fund is an active national advocate of shareholder rights, 
a movement designed to make corporate managers more responsible to 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' position in support of shareholder rights also swayed the managers of 
California's public employees' pension fund, said Kayla Gillan, a lawyer for 
the fund. The fund has about 500,000 Lockheed shares, or nearly 0.8% of the 
total. Gillan said the pension fund managers leaned toward Simmons because they 
believe he would establish a better management team. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think one (slate's) strategy is better than the other," she said, 
adding that the fund managers believe that Simmons' slate "has more flexibility 
and a better ability to react to changing market conditions." 
</P>
<P>
However, the pension fund did not decide to support the dissident slate until 
Simmons promised to appoint an advisory board made up of shareholders. The 
shareholder board would advise Lockheed's board of directors if Simmons' 
challenge is successful. 
</P>
<P>
But Lockheed, in an effort to win the backing of big shareholders, promised 
that soon after the annual meeting it will add one or more directors nominated 
by institutional investors to its board. In a prepared statement, Lockheed 
Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel M. Tellep said: "As part of our ongoing 
effort to be responsive to our various shareholder constituencies, we are 
looking into methods that would provide greater input from our institutional 
shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
The California public employees' fund is considered to be a leader in the area 
of shareholder policy on corporate governance. Analysts say other public 
pension funds often follow the California fund's lead on corporate proxy 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Flanigan, head of the California Teachers Retirement Fund, said his 
organization is still undecided. With 425,412 Lockheed shares, the fund has 
less than 1% of the total. Flanigan said he had asked the two factions to 
compromise and end the proxy battle. Lockheed, for example, could allow Simmons 
to appoint some members to the board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Michael L. Nairne, an assistant New York City controller and 
representative to the city's pension funds, refused to comment on reports that 
the funds had decided to vote for the incumbent Lockheed board. The funds 
involved hold between 1% and 2% of Lockheed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Dougherty, director of the funds' investment responsibility unit, will 
represent them at Thursday's annual meeting in Burbank, Nairne said. 
</P>
<P>
Four other institutional investors -- Oppenheimer Management Corp., Oppenheimer 
&amp; Co., the Colorado Public Employees Retirement Fund and the Wisconsin 
Investment Board -- are planning to vote for the Simmons slate, informed 
sources said. Managers of those investment funds, controllers of about 1.7% of 
Lockheed stock, were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, Lockheed's shares rose 
$1.125 to close at $37.

DISNEY CREATES POST TO WATCH OVER THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>

Anti-fur activists had denounced the Davy Crockett coonskin caps until the 
Disney theme parks changed from rabbit to artificial fur several years ago. 
Then the company heard from environmentalists worried that stray Disney helium 
balloons might be strangling marine creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last year, the giant entertainment company got into trouble with 
Florida and the federal government when Disney employees on Discovery Island at 
Walt Disney World took matters into their own hands with a pack of vultures 
that were terrorizing and bespattering the otherwise pristine zoological 
exhibit. Several birds died in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
And so Walt Disney Co. needed little prodding from environmentalists and others 
currently lobbying U.S. corporations to create senior corporate environmental 
jobs. On Monday, the company announced appointment of Kym Murphy to the new 
post of corporate vice president of environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who holds a degree in zoology from Cal State Los Angeles, has been at 
Disney since 1978. He worked first in the Imagineering section, then as 
corporate manager of marine technology and later as director of show quality 
assurance for both Walt Disney World and Disneyland, in Anaheim. He was also 
senior adviser to the Living Seas, a 5.7-million-gallon saltwater aquarium at 
the Florida facility. 
</P>
<P>
Before this, Murphy was corporate technical director at Sea World and director 
of operations at Marineland. 
</P>
<P>
In his new post, Murphy will be responsible for Disney's environmental 
compliance and policy as well as company dealings with outside environmental 
groups. Inside Disney, he will not only see that "environmentally friendly" 
products and materials are purchased, and recycling practiced where possible, 
but will encourage the use of environmental themes in the entire company's 
entertainment wares. "As a company that sees itself as having responsibility to 
millions of people that we contact each year," he said Monday, "there's a lot 
that we can do." 
</P>
<P>
"Disney is obviously tuned into the power of the media to educate the world 
about the fragile nature of the environment," said California Controller Gray 
Davis, who has pressed corporations to be more environmentally sensitive. "I 
don't know why they did this, but I'm glad they did." 
</P>
<P>
As to the vultures, Murphy denied that they prompted the company's move. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the vulture issue was a tiny, tiny little flicker in this overall 
flame," he said. "I think that Frank Wells (Disney president) is such an 
environmentalist at heart, as is Michael (Eisner, chairman) that it was an 
insignificant role." 
</P>
<P>
Still, as one Disney official admitted, the Florida affair was "a cowboy act" 
that gave the company a "black eye." Disney has since appointed a vulture 
advisory board, made up of scientists, and has come to terms with the unwelcome 
birds, which remain at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"They're one of God's critters," said Murphy. "It's just a matter of learning 
to live with them more effectively."

STRAPPED EASTERN TO CUT PAYMENTS TO CREDITORS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE CARRIER CITES HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE MOVE. PROSPECTS 
FOR EMERGING FROM BANKRUPTCY BY SUMMER ARE ALSO FADING.

Pleading that it will lose more than twice as much money this year as it had 
estimated just two months ago, bankrupt Eastern Airlines told its creditors 
Tuesday that it will have to sharply reduce the amount it has agreed to pay 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting its lenders with yet another revision of the business plan it must 
follow to get out of bankruptcy, the airline said it is so strapped that it 
must slow its planned growth this summer. And it said it probably will not be 
able to emerge from bankruptcy this summer as it had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said the main reason for its new estimate of larger losses is that it 
is attracting business travelers at a slower rate than expected. And that, it 
said, is a result of "the negative and disruptive public perception surrounding 
Eastern's reorganization process." 
</P>
<P>
In its most recent proposal, made Jan. 25 and accepted by the creditors 
committee Feb. 22, Eastern had presented a package that would have involved 
repayment of 50 cents on each dollar it owed, with 10 cents of the payment in 
cash. And that was a far cry from the 100 cents on the dollar that Eastern had 
vowed to pay on the $980 million that it owed when it filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy on March 9, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here Tuesday, Eastern President Phil Bakes told unsecured 
creditors that the company "is no longer able to go forward with the previously 
announced tentative arrangement that would have paid (the creditors) 50 cents 
on the dollar." He did not say how much Eastern now believes it will be able to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
The unsecured creditors range from airline food caterers to engine 
manufacturers. Eastern's debts to them are not guaranteed by any collateral. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the meeting, Bakes said: "I was extremely strong on the 
point that Eastern will have a successful reorganization." He said that he had 
told the creditors that Eastern was being hurt by its "environment." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he said, Eastern's preferred shareholders called for the 
liquidation of the airline. Overnight, he said, bookings fell 50%. He added 
that, as a result of adverse publicity, the airline is losing an average of two 
or three business travelers per flight. 
</P>
<P>
Bakes said the airline had more than $700 million of its own money in cash. 
But, he added, since it has been required to petition the bankruptcy judge each 
time it needs to use the money, there has been a false perception that it is 
running out of cash. The airline said it plans to ask the court soon for $80 
million from its escrow account to support its operations through midyear. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami-based airline told the creditors committee that because of a "revenue 
shortfall in the first quarter of 1990" it was "required to boost its 1990 loss 
estimate to $330 million, an increase of $185 million from its January 
estimate." 
</P>
<P>
Bakes said the creditors committee was "very attentive" during his meeting with 
them, but members of the committee could not be reached later for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The airline also told its creditors that it is no longer forecasting a profit 
in 1991, contrary to what it had said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said it would reduce its fleet to 148 from 160 by selling 
airliners. The airline has been operating about 800 daily flights, down from 
1,100 before the bankruptcy and the strike of its machinists, pilots and flight 
attendants five days earlier. Only the machinists are still on strike. 
</P>
<P>
It did not say Tuesday how many flights a day it would operate this summer, 
saying only that it would continue to grow but would have 12% fewer flights 
than planned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The airline also said it plans to cut health insurance benefits for some 
retirees, saving Eastern $33 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Neidl, an airline analyst with the investment firm of Dillon, Read 
&amp; Co., said Eastern's problem is that the low fares it is offering are 
increasing its loads but hurting its yields -- the amount of money it makes per 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the time to gradually increase yield to a viable level," he said. "I 
think that all parties want to avoid liquidation."

a linchpin of its global consumer banking strategy. American Express Travel

Continental Baking Loses Lawsuit: A U.S. District Court jury in San Francisco 
found that Continental Baking Co., maker of Wonder Bread, violated California 
antitrust laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The jury awarded $390,000 to Gordon Bread Co., a Los Angeles-based family-owned 
bakery that was bought by Certified Grocers in 1974, according to a lawyer for 
Gordon. Gordon was one of several independent bakeries that sued Continental 
and other big bakeries in 1971, alleging a plan to drive small rivals out of 
business by monopolizing the private-label bread business. Both sides are 
expected to appeal.

U.S., GERMAN FIRMS TO TEAM ON JET ENGINES;

AEROSPACE: UNITED TECHNOLOGIES AND DAIMLER-BENZ WILL OPERATE THEIR ENGINE

United Technologies Corp. and West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG announced 
preliminary agreement on Tuesday to operate their jet engine divisions as a 
single company for certain ventures, a move analysts said makes sense given 
looming defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum of understanding, Daimler-Benz will invest in Pratt &amp; 
Whitney, United Technologies' jet engine division, and United Technologies will 
invest in Daimler's Motoren und Turbinen Union, or MTU, Daimler's aerospace and 
defense division. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is setting in stone the relationship that has existed for some 
time between United Technologies and Daimler-Benz," said David Franus, an 
analyst with the market research firm Forecast International. "This is a 
synergistic agreement that will open up new markets for both of these huge 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Franus said the companies will be able to work together on projects by pooling 
their resources, allowing them to pare research and development expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The two divisions already are partners with three other jet engine makers in 
International Aero Engines, a consortium that produces the V2500 commercial jet 
engine. The other partners are Rolls-Royce PLC, Japanese Aero Engines Corp. and 
Fiat Aviazione. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement comes at a time when the aero industry is undergoing some 
serious rethinking," Franus said. "With defense cuts, United Technologies will 
undoubtedly see sales decrease, and it needs to approach other avenues in the 
commercial sector." 
</P>
<P>
During the past several years, Pratt &amp; Whitney and the Daimler unit also 
have expanded cooperation in the development and manufacturing of commercial 
jet engines, including the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-200, PW2000 and PW300 
models. 
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that a formal collaboration between our companies is an 
excellent strategic step to broaden and expand our historically close 
relationship," Robert F. Daniell, United Technologies' chairman and chief 
executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"It will allow both Pratt &amp; Whitney and MTU to expand their markets and 
complement each other's unique strengths in technology and manufacturing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniell and Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz's chairman and chief executive, said 
the agreement comes after more than two years of discussion among top 
management of both companies. Full details have not been settled, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, MTU will be Pratt &amp; Whitney's principal partner for 
Europe and the preferred partner worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Once new commercial engine programs of interest to both companies are 
identified, joint teams will coordinate research, development, manufacturing 
and marketing, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
"The joint teams will work to minimize duplication in product development and 
maximize efficiency by concentrating production of certain components for 
common products at one company or the other," the companies said in a joint 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Operations in these programs . . . will be conducted as if we were one 
organization," the companies said.

Between personal computers and mini-super computers in terms of power, 
workstations are fast becoming the upgrade of choice among PC users. And in the 
next few years, as workstations come down in price and PCs increase in 
performance, the line between them will become more blurry. 
</P>
<P>
A low-level workstation costs $4,000 and a high-end personal computer $12,000 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
Though closing rapidly, the gap between personal computers and workstations 
still exists in graphics. High-performance features are to be expected in the 
workstation, often making it more attractive than the personal computer to 
which many optional features must be added. 
</P>
<P>
But by far the most important differences between personal computers and 
workstations are in non-technical areas such as service, distribution and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, personal computers are sold through distributors and retailers, and 
workstations directly through manufacturers. Workstations are used more often 
in a technical setting and therefore have a more prestigious image in technical 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
Personal computers have the advantage of being in the buyers' comfort zone. 
Buyers are more familiar with personal computers than with workstations. 
</P>
<P>
Personal computers far outnumber workstations, and the idea of upgrading a 
familiar personal computer is less threatening than the idea of buying a new 
type of machine with an unfamiliar operating system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential in Recycling in Chip Cleaners 
</P>
<P>
Given the nod from a small group of engineers, a new technology that recycles 
the sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids used to clean silicon wafers has the 
potential to grow to a $200-million industry by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, only 20 of the so-called reprocessing systems have been installed 
in semiconductor manufacturing plants worldwide. Over the next few years, 
engineering staffs at the plants will evaluate the systems and decide to what 
extent this technology will be used in their companies' semiconductor 
manufacturing operations. Other semiconductor manufacturers are waiting to see 
if they should invest in the $600,000 technology. 
</P>
<P>
There are three advantages to acid reprocessing systems. First, they 
consistently deliver a very pure acid, which lowers contamination levels. This 
means manufacturers can produce more good chips on each silicon wafer. 
</P>
<P>
Second, they reduce acid consumption by 90% or more. Current technology 
requires the acid be periodically dumped and replenished. 
</P>
<P>
These new systems continuously recycle and purify the acids. Since the average 
selling price of bottled acid used in semiconductor manufacturing is $7 to $10 
per gallon and high-purity acids costs $15 to $27 per gallon, companies can 
recoup their investment in a reprocessing system in only a few years. 
</P>
<P>
The third advantage is that they produce much smaller amounts of waste than 
other systems, which lowers the cost of disposal. Disposal costs now run about 
$1.50 per gallon of acid used. 
</P>
<P>
The financial community, attracted by the technology's environmental angle, 
continues to fund the only two companies that are developing these reprocessing 
systems, Athens Corp. of Oceanside and Alameda Instruments in Pleasanton, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Is Growing for ASICs in Asia 
</P>
<P>
The "ASICs Age" is dawning for Taiwanese and South Korean electronics companies 
as they continue to expand into new technologies and increase their production 
of electronic systems for the military, aerospace, telecommunications and data 
processing markets. All these systems will use customized semiconductors called 
ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), and therefore represent a 
prime market for U.S. and Japanese ASICs manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
While strong in ASICs design, the electronics producers are limited in their 
capabilities to produce the specialized chips. They look to the United States 
and Japan to fill the bulk of the ASICs orders. Shipment values of ASICs to 
Asian countries other than Japan will be $455 million this year and are 
expected to reach $1.7 billion by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Customized semiconductors come in three basic types: gate arrays, cell-based 
integrated circuits and programmable logic devices. 
</P>
<P>
Japan surpassed the United States in terms of total ASICs shipments to Asia 
last year, due largely to Japan's doubling of gate array shipments to the 
region. Japanese companies will continue their surge into Asia because of their 
strong gate array performance. 
</P>
<P>
Programmable logic devices and cell-based integrated circuits come primarily 
from U.S. companies. If U.S. companies increase gate array market share and 
sustain their lead in the other two segments, Japan might lose its position as 
the No. 1 ASICs supplier to Asia by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to increased demand, Asian companies are investing heavily in 
research and development and are seeking partnerships with foreign companies to 
become ASIC manufacturers themselves. As a consequence, the competition for 
ASICs market share will become more intense in the 1990s, pitting the United 
States and Japan against other Asian countries.

EXPERTS DIVIDED ON WHERE JAPAN ECONOMY IS HEADED

<P>
As the dramatic slide in the Japanese stock market continues, an unexpected 
drop in the value of the yen has left the short-term future of Japan's economy 
clouded. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen, bankers and analysts say they are certain of one thing: The era of 
high yen, soaring stocks and low interest rates that sustained real economic 
growth at nearly 5% for the last three years has ended. 
</P>
<P>
But opinion remains divided over whether the turmoil on Tokyo's markets 
represents a bubble bursting -- or just some of the air escaping. 
</P>
<P>
After a mild dip Tuesday following the market's second-largest gain ever on 
Monday, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks had lost 18% of its value since the 
beginning of the year. Last Thursday, the plunge reached 26% at one point. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of morning trading today, the Nikkei was down 516.38. 
</P>
<P>
The yen, meanwhile, has shed 8.1% of its value this year. But all of its loss 
has come within the last several weeks, since the Feb. 18 general election. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers and dealers, who originally predicted a year of stability, now are 
bracing for more bleak days ahead. Up to a 24% drop is estimated in the 
exchange rate by the end of the year. On Tuesday, the yen closed at 156.96 to 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Even Japan's top business leaders have been left confounded by the turmoil and 
contradicting each other as to its significance. 
</P>
<P>
Eiji Suzuki, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers Assns. (Nikkeiren), 
on Thursday called the trouble "an exposure of (Japan's) bubble economy" and 
warned that if the government and the central bank fail to take appropriate 
measures, "the bubble will burst." 
</P>
<P>
However, Eishiro Saito, chairman of Keidanren (Federation of Economic 
Organizations), declared there is nothing to worry about. The fundamentals of 
Japan's economy, he said, remain solid. 
</P>
<P>
Offering a third analysis, Tokyo University business professor Kei Takeuchi 
said the plunge in yen and stock values clearly signals a change in the 
Japanese economy -- but added that the direction of the change remains unclear 
at this time. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Japan is completing a 40th consecutive month of growth, its 
third-longest boom, fueled by domestic demand rather than exports. Except for 
the effect of a 3% consumption tax implemented last April 1, price increases 
have been negligible. And both business investment and consumer spending remain 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen Japanese corporations have dropped plans to issue new stocks 
since the market began falling in earnest after last month's election, although 
capital spending plans remain robust. 
</P>
<P>
Still, analysts agree that it is too early to predict any long-term damage from 
the plunge in stocks and yen, noting that both have gone through wild swings in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, 1971, 1973 and 1987, for example, stock prices suffered plunges that 
ranged from 18% to 24%. After reaching a peak of 176 to the dollar in 1978, the 
yen too fell by nearly 50% at one point, before it started gaining value again 
and setting new records. 
</P>
<P>
Rising interest rates, however, may take their toll later. From a post-World 
War II record low of 2.5% last May, the Bank of Japan has now raised the rate 
at which it loans funds to commercial banks to 5.25%. 
</P>
<P>
Norinobu Takahashi, chief analyst at the Mitsubishi Research Institute, said 
inflation pressures from the cheaper yen, wage increases and an expanding money 
supply have grown so strong that the Bank of Japan may be forced to raise its 
discount rate to as much as 6% if the government fails to adopt a fiscal policy 
that curtails demand. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are beginning to worry that the stock plunge may create a tightening 
of the purse strings -- a "reverse assets effect" for both large corporations 
and wealthy individuals. Higher interest costs also could deal a psychological 
blow to consumers wanting to purchase color TV sets, luxury automobiles, 
refrigerators and other high-priced goods, warned Akio Tanii, president of 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 
</P>
<P>
Plant investment also could be hurt, although some economists believe that a 
growing labor shortage will force corporations to continue investing in 
labor-saving machinery, whatever the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Fears that exports may once again take off, however, were muted. 
</P>
<P>
Naruki Kato, securities chief of Sumitomo Life Insurance, predicted in the 
Asahi newspaper that Japanese investment in the United States and selling of 
the yen would continue, even though real interest rates in Japan are now higher 
than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, overseas investment -- which has expanded from big business to small 
enterprises to even individuals buying resort homes -- has helped depress the 
yen's value by creating a strong demand for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations that the yen will depreciate even more -- or at least will not 
strengthen significantly -- have spurred increased purchases of U.S. and 
European stocks and bonds. This outflow has supported the New York Stock 
Exchange, according to Masao Susaki, senior counselor of the Bank of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Skyrocketing land prices and stable rents, meanwhile, have reduced yields on 
land investments to the point that foreign real estate is a better buy and 
easier to acquire than in Japan, said Toshihiko Fukui, executive director of 
the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Even tourists are contributing to the dollar drain. Last year 9.6 million 
Japanese traveled abroad, creating a $19.3-billion deficit in Japan's tourist 
balance of payments. More than 10 million Japanese are expected to make 
overseas trips this year.

SOVIETS TO OPEN OIL FIELDS FOR VENTURES WITH U.S. FIRMS

<P>
Soviet energy officials offered Tuesday to create joint ventures with U.S. 
companies to exploit vast Soviet reserves of oil and natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for their technology and capital, oil companies "could have joint 
ventures (with the Soviets) operating by this time next year," said Tom 
Russell, chairman of Professional Geophysics Inc., the company that coordinated 
a Houston meeting between Soviet officials and U.S. oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is right," Russell said. "The Soviets are anxious to proceed, and so 
are we. It took (PGI) less than six months to negotiate and form our first 
joint venture with the Ministry of Oil and Gas Industry and just over six 
months for a joint venture with another ministry." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 75 to 100 companies met Tuesday with five officials of the 
Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas Industry. A similar meeting has been scheduled 
in London next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first meeting in which joint ventures in the Soviet Union are 
offered, but it is by no means the last one," said Aklim Moukhametzianov, a 
deputy minister and member of the Soviet parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet oil companies are not experienced (in joint ventures) and the ruble is 
not convertible yet; however, all problems can be worked out given the desire 
from both sides," he said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
The five territories available for joint ventures include four in the Western 
Siberian Basin with an estimated 13 billion barrels of oil reserves. The fifth 
is in the Bashkir region of the Volga-Urals, an area believed to have 
undiscovered oil and gas far below the surface.

U.S. DEMANDS MEET RESISTANCE IN JAPAN;

TRADE: LAWMAKERS IN TOKYO CRITICIZE ECONOMIC REFORMS SUGGESTED BY THE UNITED

Japanese legislators, meeting with U.S. officials Tuesday, balked at American 
demands that they enact broad economic reforms to help shrink the U.S. deficit 
in trade with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese members of the Japan-U.S. Parliamentarians League told U.S. Ambassador 
to Japan Michael H. Armacost and other U.S. Embassy officials that reform of 
Japan's land-use policies and its retail distribution system would be difficult 
to achieve quickly, lawmakers attending the breakfast meeting said. 
</P>
<P>
At Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's request, the Japanese government has drawn up 
proposals aimed at meeting U.S. requests made in trade talks called the 
"Structural Impediments Initiative." 
</P>
<P>
In remarks to Parliament, Japanese officials have said the reforms should be 
undertaken for the sake of Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
But other leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party are less 
conciliatory, said LDP lawmaker Takujiro Hamada, who chaired the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The parliamentarians said that resistance to the reforms was very strong in 
their constituencies and that it would take a long time to carry out the 
reforms suggested by the United States in the trade talks," Hamada said. 
</P>
<P>
"The opinions expressed by the Japanese legislators were rather severe," said 
Ichiji Ishii, another Liberal Democratic lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"They said the 'menu' of U.S. demands was much too big," said Ishii, referring 
to reports that Washington has given Japan a list of more than 200 suggestions 
aimed at eliminating structural barriers it said prevent foreign companies from 
entering Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials attending Tuesday's meeting had nothing to add to the account 
given by Hamada and Ishii. 
</P>
<P>
The United States contends that high land prices and inefficiencies in and 
restrictions on the distribution system make it harder for foreign businesses 
to enter the Japanese market. Japan says problems on the U.S. side also 
contribute to the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest round of trade talks last week, the Japanese side suggested that 
the United States tax more, wean itself from energy-wasting cars and limit the 
use of credit cards, the mass circulation newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestions were among 80 proposals for cutting the federal budget deficit, 
increasing savings and investment and improving worker training and education 
to boost the competitiveness of American exports, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators, who eventually will vote on some of the government's reform 
plans, also argued that a reduction in Japan's $49-billion trade surplus with 
the United States could be better carried out through other approaches, 
including "managed trade," or export-oriented industrial policies, Hamada said. 
</P>
<P>
He said former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, widely seen as a likely candidate 
for prime minister, stressed during the meeting that charges that Japan had 
done nothing to resolve the trade imbalance were absolutely wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems almost as if Japan is being scolded for having such a powerful, 
competitive economy," Hamada said. 
</P>
<P>
Each nation is to come up with an interim report on the SII talks in early 
April. A final report is expected in July. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Japanese people questioned in a nationwide poll were 
almost evenly split about whether U.S. criticism of Japan's trade policy is 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
The financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun said 47.4% of the 6,186 people who 
responded to the survey said they view U.S. trade complaints as basically 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
This included 9% who said they completely agree with the criticisms and 38.4% 
who replied that "the U.S. claims are basically right although there are a few 
points that seem unreasonable," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 32.9% of the respondents said the criticism was unreasonable, with an 
additional 6.6% saying the criticism was completely unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Another 13.1% said they could not say if the criticism was reasonable, or did 
not know. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three percent of the respondents said Japan should open its rice market 
at least partially to allow the sale of foreign rice "despite government 
attempts to keep Japan's rice market closed," the newspaper said.

CALIFORNIA LOTTERY HAS HURT NEVADA CASINOS, STUDY SAYS 
</P>

<P>
A study by two economics professors at the University of Nevada-Reno says the 
California lottery has cut into Nevada's casino business. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released Monday, compares revenue trends in the gambling industry 
before and after the start of the lottery in the neighboring state. 
</P>
<P>
Professors Thomas Cargill and Kambiz Raffie said their study for the years 1986 
through 1989 shows that gross gambling volume averaged 3.7% less each quarter 
once the lottery started. 
</P>
<P>
Cargill and Raffie also said there were fewer visitors to Nevada. That meant 
reduced sales tax revenue, which were 4.5% lower than if the lottery had not 
been in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated loss in gaming gross revenue to casinos last year is $170 
million. Nevada casinos reported their win at $4.5 billion for 1989, up 7% from 
the previous year. Gross revenue is computed before business expenses and taxes 
are deducted. 
</P>
<P>
Cargill said Californians may not come to Nevada as often as in the past 
because they have gambling at home. In addition, he said Nevadans are also 
going over to California to buy lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Gaming Control Board is conducting its own study of the impact on 
Nevada gambling of the lottery. Board economist Gary Horton said the lottery 
definitely "impacts" the casino industry. But he added that there were other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people who play the lottery do it at the 7-Eleven (stores), and they are 
not going to drive over the hill (to Reno) or travel to Las Vegas anyway," he 
said. The study said what casino owners have known for some time. They have 
taken steps to increase advertising and are looking for other markets outside 
of California. The industry has also set up slot machine jackpots of more than 
$1 million to counter the lottery.

A LIFETIME OF STRUGGLE PUTS POLISH POET IN DEMAND 
</P>

"It all seems now to have been a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 The dying words of Czeslaw Milosz's mother worked their way into a poem he 
read recently at Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
They stand as an apt commentary on his life: 
</P>
<P>
History has followed him across the continents, from his childhood in Czarist 
Russia, to Warsaw during World War II, to Berkeley in the 1960s. As a writer, 
he emerged from relative obscurity to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 
1980. He has lived to see his verse, once banned in Poland, now treated as a 
national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
And today, with heightened world interest in Eastern Europe, the man who 
describes himself as a "hermitic poet" is once again much in demand. 
</P>
<P>
His hands deep in his pockets, his bushy gray-white eyebrows arched above thin 
black-framed glasses, Milosz stared out at the audience of about 100 who 
gathered last Wednesday in Claremont to hear him read from his works. 
</P>
<P>
"I've basically been just a poet," Milosz said. "But in life I have written 
many other things, in spite of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Those things, including essays and prose, have been framed by the impact of 
history on moral issues, Milosz said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for students who are studying literature to see a poet who has taken 
on not simply literary matters but the range of moral and spiritual problems 
which confront human beings," said Robert Faggen, a literature professor at the 
college, who invited Milosz to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a poet with a large vision of fundamental hopes and aspirations of human 
beings, who has provided a powerful alternative to pessimistic and dehumanizing 
views of men," Faggen said. 
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old poet said his work, which for decades was circulated 
underground by the dissident Polish press, has played an important role in 
bringing change to Poland. "The movement to tie intellectuals and workers 
together was influenced by my work," he said. "The artist always has a role." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Milosz's name now is frequently mentioned in the same breath as that 
of two of the world's most renowned Poles, Pope John Paul II and Solidarity 
leader Lech Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Wednesday, a bemused Milosz reached into his pocket and pulled out 
a tiny cloverleaf-shaped pin. Given to him by an admirer when he was in Poland 
last October, it is engraved with designs: two crossed swords, a worker's 
tools, a book. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope," he said, pointing to the swords. "Walesa," he said, pointing to the 
tools. "Milosz," he said, slapping his chest and then pointing to the picture 
of the book. Smiling, he returned the keepsake to his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Milosz told a story about his first encounter with Walesa. "I told him 
that I considered him the true leader of the country, my leader," Milosz said. 
"And he said that he had gone to jail because of my poetry." 
</P>
<P>
No longer teaching, Milosz spends his time writing, lecturing and giving 
readings at universities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so fortunate to hear him speak," said Leslie Bailey, 19, a third-year 
philosophy major at Claremont McKenna. She spent a semester in Poland last 
fall, but was unable to attend a reading by Milosz in Krakow. "I couldn't get a 
pass to get in because I was an American," she said. "There were thousands of 
people there and they gave priority to Polish students." 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, though, she finally had her turn. And instead of being in an 
audience of thousands, she was among just a handful of students who met with 
Milosz in an informal seminar. The students asked the poet about nature, 
religion, art and, of course, politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I am following the changes in Eastern Europe closely," Milosz said. "I think 
the changes will have an impact on art, but I wonder in what way. It's still to 
soon to tell." 
</P>
<P>
As for his personal life, one student asked: "Do you have any hobbies?" Milosz 
laughed and responded: "Drinking, drinking vodka." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Lithuania in 1911 and raised in Poland, Milosz grew up under two 
totalitarian systems: national socialism and communism. After World War I, his 
family left the Soviet Union and returned to what was the new Polish state. 
When World War II began, Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and Milosz worked 
with the Resistance movement. 
</P>
<P>
After witnessing the subsequent Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe, he became a 
member of the new communist government's diplomatic service at the Polish 
embassies in New York, Washington and Paris. Milosz worked for the government 
until 1951, when, disenchanted, he quit and defected to the West. He remained 
in Paris and worked as a free-lance writer until 1960, when he became a 
professor of Slavic languages and literature at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the next 20 years there writing in Polish for a people living in a 
country where his books were banned. "From my room at Berkeley I see the Golden 
Gate Bridge, and there I write in Polish," he said, shrugging his shoulders. 
After Milosz won the Nobel Prize in 1980, the Polish government relented and 
lifted its freeze on his work, and the poet made his first trip home in 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Today he is so popular that a monument to slain Polish workers in Gdansk is 
inscribed with two quotations, one from the Bible, the other from a Milosz 
poem.

The pungent smells of a California winter, 
</P>
<P>
 Grayness and rosiness, an almost transparent full moon. 
</P>
<P>
 I add logs to the fire, I drink and I ponder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 "In Ilawa," the news item said, "at age 70 
</P>
<P>
 Died Aleksander Rymkiewicz, poet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 He was the youngest in our group. I patronized him slightly, 
</P>
<P>
 Just as I patronized others for their inferior minds 
</P>
<P>
 Though they had many virtues I couldn't touch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 And so I am here, approaching the end 
</P>
<P>
 Of the century and of my life. Proud of my strength 
</P>
<P>
 Yet embarrassed by the clearness of the view. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Avant-gardes mixed with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The ashes of inconceivable arts. 
</P>
<P>
 An omnium-gatherum of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 I passed judgment on that. Though marked myself. 
</P>
<P>
 This hasn't been an age for the righteous and the decent. 
</P>
<P>
 I know what it means to beget monsters 
</P>
<P>
 And to recognize them in myself.... 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 You, moon, You, Aleksander, fire of cedar logs. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters close over us, a name lasts but an instant. 
</P>
<P>
 Not important whether the generations hold us in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Great was that chase with the hounds for the unattainable meaning of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 And now I am ready to keep running 
</P>
<P>
 When the sun rises beyond the borderlands of death. 
</P>
<P>
 I already see mountain ridges in the heavenly forest 
</P>
<P>
 Where, beyond every essence, a new essence waits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 You, music of my late years, I am called 
</P>
<P>
 By a sound and a color which are more and more perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not die out, fire. Enter my dreams, love. 
</P>
<P>
 Be young forever, seasons of the earth.

The House overwhelmingly passed legislation to ban the hauling of garbage, 
chemicals and hazardous wastes in the same trucks and railroad cars used to 
carry food, beverages and grains. The bill, which is opposed by the Bush 
Administration largely because it would require the Transportation Department 
to assume enforcement responsibility, also states that asbestos, infectious 
waste and other health-threatening items must be shipped only in vehicles 
designated for that purpose. The prime target of the bill, which now goes to 
the Senate, is "backhauling," using trucks that carry food cross-country to 
carry garbage on the trip home.

Greyhound Lines Inc. offered $100,000 for information leading to convictions 
for shooting at buses and terminals during the drivers' strike. 
</P>
<P>
Since the strike began March 2, 21 buses and two terminals have been attacked. 
A company official said it would not resume talks until it had "hard 
assurances" from the union that the violence would stop. An official of the 
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, said the firm was using the 
issue as a "smoke screen" to avoid talks.

State medical officials said they have revoked the license of an El Toro 
physician accused of administering a hormonal treatment that posed a public 
danger and caused harmful side-effects in at least 18 women. Dr. Norman King 
Beals Jr., 55, who hosted a call-in radio talk show in Orange County and 
advertised heavily in local newspapers, admitted that the California Medical 
Board's allegations were true and declined to contest the charges at an 
evidentiary hearing, according to documents filed last week by the state 
attorney general's office. Beals had touted "hormonal replacement therapy" as a 
cure-all for a host of female-oriented afflictions -- including breast cancer, 
menopausal hot flashes and premenstrual syndrome.

prison authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanette Hughes, 36, was discovered missing after being escorted into a

of killing her husband, James. Her first parole hearing was to be in March, 
1998. Officials said they determined that Hughes did not escape over or under 
any of the fences surrounding the prison, but they declined to speculate 
publicly how Hughes could have gotten away.

CHANGING MONGOLIA REDISCOVERS ITS SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Khurlee, a 34-year-old herdsman, had journeyed 400 miles to turn the prayer 
wheels of Gandan Monastery. 
</P>
<P>
"My father recently died, and I came to pray that his future life will be 
good," Khurlee said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a sheepskin robe and black fur cap, he had spun dozens of the holy 
bronze cylinders, which are believed to send a prayer to heaven with each 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Khurlee's long trip was necessary because in the 1930s, in an extension of the 
Stalinist terror that was then sweeping the Soviet Union, all monasteries in 
Mongolia were either razed or closed, except for Gandan. 
</P>
<P>
Other targets in nearly 70 years of Communist rule have included Mongolia's 
ancient script and the honor of its greatest hero, Genghis Khan. 
</P>
<P>
But the winds of change sweeping across East Europe and the Soviet Union have 
penetrated this landlocked Asian country. Earlier this month, the ruling 
Communist Party replaced its entire top leadership, installing reformers 
pledged to transform the country into a multi-party democracy. But the changes 
under way here go far beyond the emergence of political pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mongolia is a nation caught up in rediscovering its soul. 
</P>
<P>
Most dramatic is the renewal of open respect for Genghis Khan, the founder of 
the Mongol nation, who united warring tribes nearly 800 years ago and set them 
to conquering most of Asia and part of Europe. Now he rides again as a symbol 
of resurgent nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
"For the rest of the world, especially for Europeans, Genghis Khan is a symbol 
of conquest, plunder and rape," said Dugersurengiin Suhjargalmaa, a journalist 
with the state-run Montsame News Agency. "For the Mongolians, he is not. First 
of all, he's the founder of a unified Mongol state. Then came all his 
conquests." 
</P>
<P>
The Russians were among those who suffered from this long-ago Mongol assault. 
So it is not surprising that after Soviet-backed Mongolian revolutionaries took 
power in 1921, establishing the world's second Communist state, Genghis Khan 
was condemned as a militaristic feudal lord. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying Genghis Khan's name out loud -- officials felt it was insulting to 
Russian friends, who were dominated for about 200 years by the Golden Horde," 
Suhjargalmaa said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, as the Soviet Union held political, military and economic 
dominance over Mongolia, Russian views and Russian culture seeped into many 
aspects of Mongolian life. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Cyrillic alphabet used in Russian was adopted for the Mongolian 
language, replacing the traditional cursive script and thereby cutting off 
young Mongolians from their literary heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Those who were angered by Soviet domination and the destruction of Mongolian 
culture have found in Genghis Khan a symbol of national greatness, one with 
convenient and not-too-subtle anti-Russian overtones. 
</P>
<P>
When political dissidents met in Ulan Bator last month to proclaim the creation 
of an opposition party and criticize the ruling Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary Party for its dependence on the Soviet Union, most of the 
delegates wore small gold pins bearing the likeness of Genghis Khan. 
</P>
<P>
Even among Communist officials, there is anger about what has been lost, paired 
with a resurgence of pride in all things Mongolian. 
</P>
<P>
"We have forgotten our customs and national traditions, which were deeply 
rooted in our history," said L. Had, chief of an agricultural cooperative 
centered in the village of Altan Bulag. "Until recently, we did not even 
celebrate lunar New Year. There was no openness about our society's problems. 
We have lost the roots of our national heritage." 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Had said, people have begun again to freely mark sacred 
hills in keeping with the customs of Tibetan Buddhism, traditionally dominant 
in Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
It has been reported in the Western press that the approximately 750 Buddhist 
monasteries and temples that existed at the time of the 1921 revolution were 
all destroyed, with the single exception of Gandan. But this is not quite true. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Mongolia's greatest monasteries -- Amarbayasgalan and Erdene Dzuu -- 
were shut down and damaged, but not demolished. Situated to the west of Ulan 
Bator, in Bulgan province, both are of major importance in Tibetan Buddhism. 
Both are to reopen soon for religious activity by monks and other worshipers, 
according to the government and opposition activists. 
</P>
<P>
D. Baasan, a Gandan monk, said significant buildings remain at about 40 sites 
out of the original 750. He predicted that these surviving structures 
eventually will reopen for worship. 
</P>
<P>
"It will depend on the believers," Baasan said. "There is no need to wait, but 
we need some restoration work. I think if people are active, it will take two 
or three years." 
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of traditional culture are also being revived. The national 
costume, a brightly colored knee-length silk or woolen robe, which had become 
quite rare in the cities, is enjoying a renewed popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts have been made by the state-run news media to encourage the use of 
Mongolian words to replace adopted Russian terms that have found their way into 
the language. 
</P>
<P>
Ulan Bator's last statue of Stalin was taken down in February, and some people 
have called for the figure of Genghis Khan to be raised in its place. In all 
Mongolia, there is today only a single monument honoring the nation's most 
famous leader, and that is in the remote village of his birth, far from the 
capital city. 
</P>
<P>
It is a situation that the popular rock group Honkh, whose songs have become 
anthems of the opposition political movement, laments in the lyric of the song 
"Forgive Us": 
</P>
<P>
 Great Emperor, Lord Genghis, our ancestor, 
</P>
<P>
 We fear even to speak of you, for we have been told never to acknowledge 
having heard your name. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They have collected only what was bad in your life, making blind history and 
leaving us, your descendants, confused. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There are hundreds of monuments, but none for you. We want to shout your name, 
but we can't. 
</P>
<P>
 We, descendants of the Mongols of the blue sky, have become so pitiful. 
Forgive us. 
</P>
<P>
 No new statues of Genghis Khan have appeared yet. But filming is scheduled to 
start soon for a movie on his life. Calendars bear his portrait, and a new 
hotel going up in Ulan Bator is to be called the Genghis Khan. 
</P>
<P>
"It is supposed to be a five-star hotel," Suhjargalmaa, the journalist, said. 
</P>
<P>
She expressed concern that the new hotel might fail to be worthy of Genghis 
Khan, who after all was a severe disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid it will turn into a two-star, and we will bring shame on his 
name," she said, an irreverent twinkle lighting her eyes. "If so, he would be 
the first to cut off our heads."

DEATH SQUADS' TERRORISM BECOMES SRI LANKA SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MORATUWA, Sri Lanka 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a yearlong reign of terror by government-backed death squads that emptied 
villages of young men and littered Sri Lanka's beaches with corpses, the 
fishermen of Moratuwa were hardly surprised when they spotted yet another body 
floating 250 yards offshore recently. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, it was different. When the fishermen got the body to shore, they 
knew that this was not just another anonymous suspect in the government's 
brutal counterinsurgency campaign. 
</P>
<P>
It was Richard De Zoysa, nationally known television newscaster and film actor, 
who most recently had been writing exposes on the abuses of Sri Lanka's death 
squads. 
</P>
<P>
Just that morning, Sri Lankan radio had announced that a group of armed men, 
some in police uniform, had abducted the 31-year-old journalist from his 
mother's home in the capital of Colombo the previous day. And now, the Indian 
Ocean fishermen recognized De Zoysa's body, with two bullet wounds in the head, 
as something that did not fit the pattern of their coastal killing ground. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks that have followed De Zoysa's murder in late February, his case 
has mushroomed into a national scandal reaching to the highest levels of 
government. Diplomats, lawyers and even members of Colombo's powerful ruling 
elite now say his death has come to symbolize a terrifying legacy of death 
squads gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
"What the state unleashed a year ago we describe as counterterror, and it 
apparently succeeded in breaking the back of an equally brutal insurgency," 
said Colombo attorney Batty Weerakoon, who is representing De Zoysa's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"But once it was broken, the people began to wonder why these killings should 
continue. A year ago, the human rights violations were directed very 
specifically at subversives and terrorists. Today, they are directed at all 
kinds of opposition. Anybody who criticizes the people at the top is running a 
big risk." 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 days after De Zoysa's murder, for example, a death squad in another 
town near Colombo shot, set aflame and killed 13 members of the Sri Lanka 
Freedom Party, the main opposition to President Ranasinghe Premadasa's ruling 
party. Several policemen have been arrested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, local opposition leaders have been assassinated individually or have 
complained of persistent telephoned death threats. 
</P>
<P>
Five human rights lawyers investigating the activities of hit squads or 
representing victims' families have been murdered. Weerakoon himself said this 
week: "Now, even I don't know what a fellow might do to me. I am also 
terrorized." 
</P>
<P>
Already the De Zoysa murder has had a chilling effect on the media as well. At 
least four journalists have fled the country under death threats, and those who 
remain say they are consciously avoiding any subject critical of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent activity of the death squads emerges against a backdrop that is 
as gruesome as the present record. 
</P>
<P>
In the southern regions of this island nation -- once so idyllic that Mark 
Twain, a visitor in the 19th Century, nicknamed it Serendip -- there are entire 
villages where only children and the elderly remain. All of the men between 15 
and 35 have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Many were summarily executed under continuing emergency laws that permit 
security forces to kill suspects without trial or identification. Others remain 
in overflowing military jails, where they're being held without charges or 
notification of their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
At camps throughout the south, where the grass-roots insurgency by the People's 
Liberation Army began in earnest three years ago, scores of mothers can still 
be seen pressing up against the barbed wire, waiting for word of their sons, 
husbands or fathers. 
</P>
<P>
The leftist insurgents also contributed heavily to the horror. Before their 
leader, Rohana Wijeweera, and his top lieutenants were captured and quickly 
executed by security forces late last year, guerrilla units routinely bound 
suspected government informants in village clearings and beheaded them as 
villagers were forced to watch. 
</P>
<P>
They forced shopkeepers, bus drivers and rickshaw pullers to observe general 
strikes by torturing and killing those who refused to comply, often paralyzing 
the nation and its economy. 
</P>
<P>
Until the government unleashed its death squads a year ago, most analysts 
agreed that the insurgents were on the verge of taking power by force. 
</P>
<P>
The death toll on both sides in the past year alone is staggering. The most 
conservative estimate, by diplomatic observers, is 8,000, in a nation of just 
15 million. Human rights workers put it as high as 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Political analyst Neelan Tiruchelvam, borrowing a quote from Czechoslovak 
President Vaclav Havel, said: "Society in Sri Lanka is now morally flawed. It 
has lost its capacity to distinguish between right and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
It was in this context that the group of heavily armed men came to Manorani 
Saravanamuttu's modest Colombo home and demanded her son, De Zoysa, just after 
3 a.m. on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his relative youth, De Zoysa, a veteran journalist, knew all the top 
Sri Lankan politicians personally -- even President Premadasa. He was employed 
full-time as a correspondent of the Rome-based Inter Press Service, an 
international news agency focused on a Third World market. But he was also an 
outspoken and respected actor and a fixture in Colombo's artistic community. 
</P>
<P>
As a journalist, De Zoysa had written Inter Press dispatches highly critical of 
the death squads, among them an article last August entitled, "Sri Lanka: 
Nearing a Human Rights Apocalypse." But he also had worked on documentary films 
favorable to the government, and friends now say they believe it was De Zoysa's 
ties to the theater world, as much as his journalistic work, that made him a 
target for death. 
</P>
<P>
The word was out that De Zoysa had helped produce a satirical play that was 
savagely critical of Premadasa, who has been so sensitive to personal criticism 
that he has barred at least two foreign journalists from Sri Lanka simply for 
writing about his low-caste roots. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial play was called "Who Is He and What Is He Doing?" But the 
curtain never went up. The night before its February debut, producer Lakshman 
Perera, an openly critical member of Premadasa's ruling party, disappeared and 
is now believed to have been murdered. 
</P>
<P>
It was the next morning that the armed men appeared at De Zoysa's mother's 
front door, demanding to see her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a fool," Saravanamuttu, a prominent physician and daughter of a former 
Sri Lankan diplomat, told The Times in an interview this week. "I'm a doctor. 
I've lived a long time. I've worked with police on investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"(One) man was in full police uniform, but I demanded to see some 
identification. He said, 'I.D. cards aren't necessary. If you don't let us in, 
we'll shoot you.' I had no choice, and minutes later, they took Richard away." 
</P>
<P>
Saravanamuttu said that she, her houseboy and neighbors gave detailed 
descriptions of at least two of the men to police, and the houseboy gave the 
license number of the jeep used to take De Zoysa away. But she and her lawyer, 
Weerakoon, charge that police have done nothing to trace them. 
</P>
<P>
"They just want to cover this whole thing up," Weerakoon said. "It's right from 
the top." 
</P>
<P>
Police Supt. Gamini Perera, Colombo's chief of detectives and the head of the 
De Zoysa investigation, insists that his men are trying to find the killers, 
although he denies that the witnesses gave police any physical descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he has been under political pressure in the case, Perera 
declared: "Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
President Premadasa, who has been the focus of popular speculation about the 
case, has cast himself as a friend and sympathizer of De Zoysa's family. 
</P>
<P>
Saravanamuttu said she will keep pressing. "I'm just not going to give this up 
without a fight," she vowed, saying that she will continue her court battle to 
push the police investigation "no matter where it leads." 
</P>
<P>
Then her anger subsided for a moment, and she added, "There is another side to 
this, you know. I really am very lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I feel I'm the luckiest mother in Sri Lanka, because at least I got 
my son's body back. I could give Richard a decent funeral and, as hard as this 
sounds, at least I know he's really dead. 
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of other mothers out there who just don't know, who are 
still simply sitting there and waiting."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
VAN DE KAMP IS TARGET IN TV COUNTERATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The TV ad opens with California gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein in a 
bold red suit, looking directly into the camera and challenging her Democratic 
opponent, John K. Van de Kamp, to run a positive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case he doesn't get the point, Feinstein's image is suddenly 
replaced by a 1950 photograph of Richard M. Nixon, who Feinstein says "smeared" 
his U.S. Senate opponent, Helen Gahagan Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
As the battle of the TV ads continues to push the California governor's race 
away from a discussion of the issues, Feinstein's advisers have come up with a 
surprising -- and maybe risky -- answer to a commercial Van de Kamp is running 
that attacks her record as mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Her campaign advisers William Carrick and Hank Morris offered Feinstein 
possible avenues of counterattack. But they said she rejected this tactic for 
now and chose to capitalize on her front-runner status and try to focus 
attention on the tone of the Democratic gubernatorial primary election. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the 30-second remember-Nixon spot that the campaign started 
producing Monday by filming Feinstein in Los Angeles and finished Tuesday in a 
New York studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when Richard Nixon smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and distorted 
(the) record. And we all remember the 1988 (presidential) campaign," Feinstein 
says in her commercial challenge. The first reference was to a very nasty 
California U.S. Senate race in 1950, in which Nixon won his only statewide 
election in part by accusing Douglas of being a communist sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the new commercial were shipped to TV stations throughout California 
on Tuesday night and will begin airing in various markets tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a high-risk strategy because the usual response to an attack like Van 
de Kamp's is a counterattack," Carrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris added: "We all know the public is tired of negative ads, but the fact is 
they almost always work." 
</P>
<P>
The consultants admit that Feinstein may be uniquely positioned to try to pull 
off this latest tactic because she is a woman candidate who was sometimes 
called "Goody Two Shoes" when she was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
She sought to back up that approach Tuesday with a speech to business and civic 
leaders in Los Angeles. She declared, "Let's make 1990 the year when we break 
with the past and put negative politics behind us. Unfortunately, it takes two 
to make a positive campaign." 
</P>
<P>
But the Van de Kamp campaign said the linking of Van de Kamp to the memory of 
Nixon was as down and dirty as anything seen so far in this campaign. And more, 
Van de Kamp aides said this was not the first time she had tried to link an 
opponent to a reviled politician. They produced a San Francisco Examiner news 
clipping from her 1979 race for mayor of San Francisco in which she likened an 
opponent to a racist politician. 
</P>
<P>
The opponent was Quentin Kopp, now a state senator. The article said that 
brochures Feinstein sent out contained testimonials from black leaders and this 
headline: "The Real Quentin Kopp-George Wallace Returns." (Wallace was governor 
of Alabama and one of the foremost segregationists of the 1950s and 1960s). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Van de Kamp has his own problems with his latest TV ad. Lawyers for 
the San Francisco Chronicle Publishing Co. said they sued him in federal court 
Tuesday for trademark infringement because the spot Van de Kamp is now running 
uses the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper's name four times as it cites 
articles to back up its charges that Feinstein left the city in debt and dumped 
sewage in San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Chronicle Publishing Co. saw their trademark in a photograph 
taken from the Van de Kamp ad that was published in the Los Angeles Times last 
week along with an analysis of some of the Van de Kamp charges against 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
The Van de Kamp campaign agreed to remove the Chronicle Page 1 nameplate from 
its ad, but Chronicle general counsel Ron Ingram said Tuesday that the type 
used in the remake of the Van de Kamp ad still infringed on the Chronicle 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"It still makes it appear that we are sponsoring the attack on Dianne 
Feinstein," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the independent challenges to Van de Kamp's ad, Carrick and Morris 
believe that the attacks have hurt Feinstein, who soared ahead of Van de Kamp 
and the presumptive Republican gubernatorial nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, in 
a Los Angeles Times poll taken last month. 
</P>
<P>
The new Feinstein commercial begins with Feinstein citing a Van de Kamp 
quotation from some months ago in which he said he thought the public was tired 
of negative campaigns. "Weeks ago, John Van de Kamp said people are tired of 
negative campaigns," Feinstein says as she looks into the camera. "I don't know 
about John, but I really believe that. I still remember when Richard Nixon 
smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and distorted her record. And we all remember the 
1988 campaign. We Californians are trend-setters. So let's make 1990 the year 
we put negative politics behind us." 
</P>
<P>
But does this strategy mean that Feinstein can go through the entire Democratic 
primary without running a harsh ad about Van de Kamp? 
</P>
<P>
"That's what Dianne would like, but we aren't making any promises," Carrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE TV CAMPAIGN 
</P>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ad? Democratic candidate and former San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein. Target of ad: Her opponent in the primary election, 
current Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
 What the ad says, with an analysis by Times political writer Keith Love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Weeks ago John Van de Kamp said people are tired of negative campaigns. I 
don't know about John, but I really believe that." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein is referring to a statement Van de Kamp made last year at a 
fund raiser: "People are tired of negative campaigns, tired of negative 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "I still remember when Richard Nixon smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas and 
distorted her record. And we all remember the 1988 campaign. " 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein is referring to a particularly nasty U.S. Senate race in 
1950 in California, in which Nixon won his only statewide campaign in part by 
accusing Douglas of being soft on communism. The reference to the 1988 
presidential campaign derives from widespread criticism of President George 
Bush and, later, Democratic nominee Michael S. Dukakis for some of their harsh 
TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: ". . . let's make 1990 the year we put negative politics behind us. . . . 
Mr. Van de Kamp, it takes two to make a positive campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Feinstein is sure to face criticism for, in effect, comparing Atty. 
Gen. Van de Kamp to Richard M. Nixon, who resigned his presidency in August, 
1974, during the Watergate scandal.

LA JOLLA WOMAN CONFESSES TO MURDERS; 
</P>

CRIME: IN A CALL FROM JAIL, BETTY BRODERICK TERMS THE SLAYINGS OF HER 
EX-HUSBAND AND HIS NEW WIFE A 'DESPERATE ACT OF SELF-DEFENSE.'

<P>
Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick on Tuesday confessed in a newspaper interview 
to killing her ex-husband and his new wife last November, describing the 
slayings as a "desperate act of self-defense" against a man who wanted "to 
control me totally." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with The Times, the 42-year-old mother of four said 
she did not plan to kill Daniel T. Broderick III, 44, and his 28-year-old wife, 
Linda, in the early morning hours on Sunday, Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from a pay phone at a San Diego County jail where she has been held 
since her arrest on murder charges the day of the killings, she said: "I had 
just bought about $400 worth of groceries on Saturday. I bought fresh veal and 
swordfish and all this wonderful stuff. Do you think I knew? I had no idea I 
was going to do this at all. I didn't know I was doing it." 
</P>
<P>
But Betty Broderick said that late Saturday night she had trouble sleeping. She 
went to the kitchen of her La Jolla home and reread some legal papers she had 
received on Friday from Daniel Broderick, a prominent San Diego malpractice 
attorney. The papers said she was in contempt of court because she had left 
vulgar messages on Daniel and Linda Broderick's telephone answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I couldn't win," said Betty Broderick, who had been negotiating with 
her ex-husband to gain custody of their two younger children, Danny and Rhett. 
</P>
<P>
So, she said, she got dressed, got in her car and started driving. "When I left 
my house, I didn't know where I was going," she said, but she ended up at her 
ex-husband's house not far from downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick had a ring of keys that her maid had found behind a chair in 
her house. According to testimony at her preliminary hearing last week, they 
were her daughter Kimberly's keys, and one of them fit the door to her 
ex-husband's home. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick said she climbed the stairs to the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
She said she started firing her .38-caliber, five-shot revolver, but she wasn't 
sure if she had hit anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a panicked thing. It was never a thing where I even aimed. I 
pulled (the trigger) real fast -- no hesitation at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Daniel Broderick spoke, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say, 'You shot me,' " she said, correcting her daughters' testimony 
at the hearing. "He said, 'OK, OK, you got me.' There was no pain and there was 
no blood. It was simple." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Broderick was shot in the head and chest. Daniel Broderick was hit once 
in the back. Another bullet struck the wall, police said, and a fifth hit a 
bedside table. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no bullets or anything and I just had to get out of there," she said. 
Then she saw Daniel Broderick. "He was on the floor and the phone was right 
next to him. I thought, 'Oh, my God! He is going to be on that phone before I'm 
down the stairs.' " 
</P>
<P>
She said she pulled the phone out of the wall and fled. 
</P>
<P>
Betty and Daniel Broderick had divorced in 1986, after 16 years of marriage. 
She accused him of using his legal influence to cheat her out of her share of 
his seven-figure income. She was receiving $16,100 a month at the time of the 
murders. Daniel Broderick had told friends his ex-wife would not dare kill him 
because he was her "golden goose." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick's statements Tuesday confirmed testimony at her preliminary 
hearing, where her two daughters and two friends testified that she had 
admitted shooting Daniel and Linda Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, who has pleaded not guilty to the slayings, is scheduled to be 
arraigned in San Diego Superior Court next Tuesday.

SPRAYING FIRM HAS RECORD OF ACCIDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: SAN JOAQUIN HELICOPTERS HAS A HISTORY OF CRASHES AND REPEATED 
VIOLATIONS OF STATE PESTICIDE REGULATIONS, RECORDS SHOW. 
</P>

DELANO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The company hired by the state to spray malathion over Southland neighborhoods 
has a history of safety problems, including nine helicopter crashes since 1983 
and repeated violations of state pesticide regulations, government records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
At least six of the accidents involving helicopters owned by San Joaquin 
Helicopters Inc. occurred when the aircraft were flying at low altitude over 
farms in the San Joaquin Valley. In four of the crashes the pilots were 
injured, and in two cases the helicopters were demolished, according to 
National Transportation Safety Board records. 
</P>
<P>
San Joaquin Helicopters, one of the region's largest pesticide application 
companies, also has been cited 13 times since 1986 for violating state 
pesticide regulations in Kern and Fresno counties, according to the counties' 
records. Among other things, the firm was cited for spraying crops with 
prohibited pesticides and for illegally discharging chemicals on a county road. 
</P>
<P>
And, reports by Kern County officials show, the company has been involved in a 
number of pesticide injury cases for which it was not cited, including two 
occasions when chemicals sprayed from helicopters drifted onto workers in 
nearby fields -- causing 13 people to become ill. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said that the past safety problems of San Joaquin Helicopters 
do not indicate any similar hazards to residents of Los Angeles and Orange 
counties, where the company is spraying malathion to eradicate the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday, however, the officials said they were unaware of the company's 
history of crashes. They also acknowledged that they did not check San Joaquin 
Helicopter's record of pesticide regulation violations before hiring the firm. 
But they defended the state's choice, saying the company has a good overall 
safety record for its aerial pesticide applications. 
</P>
<P>
"When you add all these up with all of the helicopters they're flying in the 
state, I don't think that's much of a bad record," said Rex Magee, associate 
director of the Department of Food and Agriculture. "Comparing them with others 
in the business would not indicate they have any worse problems than anyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
As a further indication of the company's good standing with state officials, 
the president of San Joaquin Helicopters, Jim Josephson, was appointed in 1989 
to serve for a second term on the state Agricultural Pest Control Advisory 
Committee. Josephson was named by then-Food and Agriculture Director Jack 
Parnall to the panel, which advises the department on how to regulate the 
pesticide application industry. 
</P>
<P>
Any safety problems in the San Joaquin Valley have little bearing on the 
operation to spray malathion over homes in Southern California, Magee said. 
</P>
<P>
During farm operations, the helicopters fly at much lower altitudes and must 
constantly avoid such obstacles as trees and power lines. During spraying for 
the Medfly, the helicopters fly in a straight line at an altitude of about 500 
feet. In addition, state workers handle all ground crew activities for the 
Medfly spraying, while in normal farmland operations, these duties are 
performed without state involvement. 
</P>
<P>
None of the helicopters that were involved in the accidents are being used in 
the malathion spraying operation, according to a check of the aircraft 
registration numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Josephson denied in a telephone interview that any of his company's helicopters 
had ever crashed. "There's been no incident involving helicopters," Josephson 
said before refusing to discuss the matter further. 
</P>
<P>
However, NTSB records show that helicopters flown by the Delano-based company 
have gone down in nine crashes ranging as far south as Arvin in Kern County and 
as far north as Chowchilla in Madera County. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the six most recent accidents were available from records of the 
Federal Aviation Administration, and, in two cases, from eyewitness accounts: 
</P>
<P>
* On Sept. 30, 1988, a helicopter applying paraquat to cotton west of the town 
of McFarland ran out of fuel on takeoff, landed in the field and rolled over. 
The pilot was not injured but the helicopter, a Hiller UH-12E, was 
substantially damaged. 
</P>
<P>
* On March 14, 1988, a helicopter involved in frost control for almonds on the 
Tejon Ranch near Arvin ran into a transmission tower line and crashed, injuring 
the pilot and demolishing the Bell UH-1B aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
* On March 8, 1987, a helicopter spraying pesticides in an almond orchard hit a 
tree and crashed southeast of McFarland. The pilot was not injured, but the 
Hiller OH-23G helicopter was substantially damaged. 
</P>
<P>
* On Feb. 19, 1987, a Hiller STOUH-12 ran out of fuel near Coalinga and 
crashed, substantially damaging the helicopter. The pilot, who was not injured, 
reported that the fuel gauge was inoperative, the FAA report said. 
</P>
<P>
* On June 17, 1986, a Hiller UH-12E crashed near Delano after parts of the main 
rotor blade separated in flight. The pilot was not injured but his craft was 
substantially damaged. An investigation found that the blades were not 
airworthy. 
</P>
<P>
* On April 16, 1986, a Bell UH-1B lost power near Chowchilla and rolled over 
during an emergency landing. The pilot was injured and the helicopter was 
demolished. An investigation found there was no oil in the transmission. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, according to the NTSB, two Hiller UH-12 helicopters operated by the 
company crashed in separate accidents near Delano, in both cases injuring the 
pilots. And in 1983, a Hughes 369D helicopter crashed near Caliente. No one was 
injured in that crash. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from its accident record, San Joaquin Helicopters has been cited by Kern 
and Fresno counties agriculture commissioners for violating a variety of 
regulations in its aerial and ground applications of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Among the violations were aerial spraying of an almond orchard where a crew was 
working, illegally disposing of pesticide containers by burning, improperly 
labeling pesticide containers, and not providing proper training to workers. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, a helicopter sprayed pesticide on bees in a field without 
notifying the beekeeper as required. And twice, the company sprayed crops with 
pesticides that were not permitted for use on those crops. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the company received warning notices for the violations. In one 
instance, the company was fined $150 for not requiring employees to wear proper 
safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wells, an official in the pest management division of the California 
Department of Food and Agriculture, said the state did not review the company's 
record before hiring the firm because it was not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department has routinely reissued state pesticide applicator 
licenses to San Joaquin Helicopters and a host of other pesticide companies 
without checking their safety records. 
</P>
<P>
But Wells defended the overall safety record of San Joaquin Helicopters, 
contending that all of the violations were relatively minor. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the amount of work (Josephson) did, both ground and air, his record 
is not poor," Wells said. "Anybody who does a lot of work is going to have 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
No citations were issued in the cases where pesticides drifted onto workers 
during helicopter spraying. In one case, seven workers in a nearby almond 
orchard suffered ill effects from the potent pesticide parathion. And in 
another case, six employees became ill after they were sprayed with a dose of 
malathion in a concentration much stronger than that used in the Southland 
Medfly spraying operation.

"Yes." The notion leaps off Dianne Feinstein's tongue like an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Democratic nominee for governor is committed to a water plan to bring 
north and south together at last. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, she wants to bring California's brightest leaders together and form a new 
"21st Century Committee" to advise her on how to keep the economy booming and 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, population and business growth can be managed because there are still 
wide-open places in California such as Chico that want to get bigger and 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this all can be done and the environment protected, too, with the help of 
a strong "public-private partnership" and "by an active role by the governor 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein delivered this cheery economic address Tuesday to the Los Angeles 
World Affairs Council, and about the only "no" she had for her audience of 
business and civic leaders was, no, she did not favor direct subsidies to 
competition-weary high-tech businesses. But, yes, she would assist such firms 
by standing up for fair trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Feinstein's graceful stage presence and sincere demeanor earned her a 
warm reception. In this case, it also gave a conservative-leaning audience a 
chance to hear from a front-runner and listen to her can-do, say-yes vision for 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
The former two-term mayor of San Francisco said she believed that California 
will weather impending defense industry budget cuts without a shock to the 
economy, and she mentioned several reasons for this. Among them, she cited a 
Wells Fargo Bank study that shows that the state's dependence on defense 
contracts is down from 7.5% of total personal income in 1983 to 4% now. 
</P>
<P>
Also, NASA contracts are up, the state stands to benefit from aircraft back 
orders and the state's overall economy is increasingly diversified, she said. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Feinstein said she will convene a California economic summit within 
90 days of taking office. And she offered another new proposal -- this one to 
establish the "Cal 21" committee of business, academic and governmental leaders 
to keep California from dropping its guard and growing stale in the face of 
turbulent international economic competition. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she got so enthused that she stepped on her own lines. Maybe only a 
few caught it, but she did offer the audience two No. 1 priorities -- education 
and growth management. 
</P>
<P>
About her other promises, she was specific only on growth management, one of 
her favorite campaign planks. She is proposing a state commission, such as the 
Coastal Commission, to help plan for population growth into the new century. 
</P>
<P>
One thing such a commission can do, she suggested, is identify those areas in 
California "that cry out for some growth opportunities that other areas of the 
state don't want." She pinpointed a Northern California college town she 
visited as just such an area -- trying to attract business with land giveaways. 
Aides later identified the community as Chico. 
</P>
<P>
She cleanly avoided one of the toughest yes-or-no questions facing anyone 
seeking high office -- how to pay for all her new ideas at a time of budgetary 
constraint. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will help her reach that answer in June, she said. 
</P>
<P>
That is when Californians will vote on Proposition 111, the ballot measure to 
lift California's ceiling on spending growth and incrementally raising the 
gasoline tax to build highways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bellwether vote because I think it's going to demonstrate whether 
Californians really want to face the problems the future brings us -- the 
problems of growth and managing that growth," she said. "So until 111 passes, 
it does very little good to discuss any other revenue measures."

SYRIA OPEN TO PEACE TREATY, CARTER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYS ASSAD HAS DRASTICALLY ALTERED HIS STANCE 
ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL.

Former President Jimmy Carter said Tuesday that Syrian President Hafez Assad, 
for years a leader of the Arab "rejection front" that is opposed to any 
relationship with Israel, is ready to acknowledge Israel's right to exist and 
to engage in direct peace negotiations with Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who held 7 1/2 hours of talks with Assad in Damascus earlier this 
month, said the Syrian leader authorized him to report that Syria is ready to 
talk about a peace treaty to replace the hostile truce that has prevailed since 
the end of the 1973 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that Assad's attitude toward the peace process is 
much more constructive than it was before," Carter said in a speech to the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Carter left little doubt that Assad's acceptance of Israel's continued 
existence is based more on a recognition of harsh political reality than on a 
change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
Assad has not dropped his insistence on an international conference as the 
vehicle for Middle East peace negotiations, Carter said, but the Syrian 
president now is ready to move directly from the conference to face-to-face 
talks with Israel. This procedure is at the heart of the peace plan advocated 
by former U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said Assad envisions a conference attended by the United States, the 
Soviet Union, Britain, France, China, Israel and the Arab nations as a forum 
for public debate, while acknowledging that the real negotiations would be held 
directly with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"He was ready to adjourn immediately after expressing Syria's best case to the 
world, to (move to) direct bilateral talks with Israel in order to resolve all 
the differences that exist between Syria and Israel," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Assad said he agrees that the international conference should 
have no power to impose an accord or to veto any pact hammered out between 
Israel and the Arabs. In the past, Assad insisted that the international panel 
must have real powers. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has objected to the international conference format because it has 
feared that the outside powers might side with the Arabs to force a settlement 
on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Carter made no 
mention of any switch in Syrian policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a word," said Avi Pazner, the spokesman. "I was present when Carter met 
with the prime minister, and there was no talk of something so dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
Carter visited Israel after his talks with Assad in Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said Assad's private acknowledgement to Carter of 
Israel's right to exist stops far short of a public statement by the Syrian 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
However, William B. Quandt, a Middle East expert during the Carter 
Administration and now on the staff of the Brookings Institution, said that 
Assad seems to have gone beyond his former position. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is there is some real movement, but it is hard to say how much and 
how serious and what the intentions are," Quandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Syria broke diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1978 after the late President 
Anwar Sadat agreed to negotiate a peace with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem 
Begin. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said that Assad might have been motivated by a realization that the 
Soviet Union, Syria's chief arms supplier, would be unwilling to support 
another war against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he believes that Assad would agree to a treaty that would turn the 
Golan Heights into a demilitarized zone. Israel captured the Golan from Syria 
during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and subsequently annexed it.

Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk warned his American critics 
Tuesday that any cutoff of U.S. aid to his guerrilla faction will only force 
him closer to China. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk, the head of a three-faction resistance coalition seeking to oust the 
Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government, has come under growing criticism in 
recent months for his relations with the radical Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia with a reign of terror from 1975 through 1978 
under the leadership of Pol Pot. 
</P>
<P>
But Sihanouk, charging Tuesday that Vietnam has redrawn maps to take over 
territory along Cambodia's southeast border, stressed that he fears Vietnamese 
control of his nation more than he fears the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
"You approve of the liberation of Czechoslovakia, of Poland, of East Germany, 
of Hungary, of Lithuania from the Soviet Union," Sihanouk said at a press 
conference. "But you say that the Cambodian patriots, they are criminals, 
because there is Pol Pot. Pol Pot or not, we are Cambodians. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk, who along with the Khmer Rouge already relies heavily on Chinese 
military aid, stressed that he has profound differences with the Khmer Rouge.

GORBACHEV READIES FAST, RADICAL ECONOMIC CURE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: HE SEES NEED TO SHIFT FROM CENTRAL CONTROL TO A MORE 
ENTREPRENEURIAL SYSTEM.

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday that he intends to take a series of 
quick, radical measures to pull the Soviet economy out of its profound crisis 
and shift it from central planning and management to a more entrepreneurial 
system based on market forces. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, addressing the first session of the country's new, policy-setting 
Presidential Council, said that the program will attempt to "radicalize 
economic reforms" and will undertake "the controlled transfer to market 
relations" and thus introduce a mixed economy here. 
</P>
<P>
A package of integrated measures aimed at establishing "a normal, fully fledged 
market" will be ready within two weeks, Gorbachev said, and will include a new 
mechanism to set state prices, an end to the government's chronic budget 
deficit, banking reform, a revamped credit policy, a new system of fiscal 
controls and the break-up of the state's present industrial monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
Other steps will be taken shortly, he continued, to put into effect 
agricultural reforms, including the allocation of land to farmers for 
cultivation outside the plans of state farms or collective farms. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, state-owned enterprises will continue to predominate in the 
Soviet economy, Gorbachev said, but the ways that they are managed will change 
substantially. There will also develop new, small enterprises, many owned by 
collectives, others by entrepreneurs and their families and some the result of 
foreign investment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, at least 20 measures are planned, according to informed Soviet 
economists, with some, such as the establishment of a bond market and setting 
new state prices for agricultural produce, to be enacted by presidential 
decree. Others would be introduced as emergency legislation, including laws on 
price reform and foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
While all these measures have long been debated by Soviet economists and many 
have been accepted in principle by the government, Gorbachev told the council 
that he now intends to implement them, using his new powers as executive 
president when required. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at a critical point that calls for well-considered decisions," 
Gorbachev said, according to an account of his speech by the official news 
agency Tass, but he gave no details of the actual policy changes nor a 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
Social discontent is rising quickly, Gorbachev noted, attributing this to the 
lack of economic development and arguing that the "further radicalization of 
perestroika" is the only solution. 
</P>
<P>
"Society is unquiet and unstable," he said. "Order and discipline have 
slackened. Inter-ethnic relations have become exacerbated. People experience a 
lot of difficulties and disappointments and want a quicker solution to problems 
and a calm and normal atmosphere. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is this failure to solve economic problems," he continued, "that is the 
cause of the social and, to a considerable extent, ethnic tension." 
</P>
<P>
The government's reforms up to now have not succeeded in transforming the 
country's economy, Gorbachev said, and in many respects have made it worse, 
largely because many of the reforms were never or only half-heartedly 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
With state enterprises monopolizing the market and without the economic levers, 
such as taxes, fiscal controls and price policy, that are common in capitalist 
countries, the Soviet Union has had no real market governed by supply and 
demand, and little has changed, he said.

<P>
Western European analysts expressed fears Tuesday that East-West relations 
would suffer a severe setback if the Soviet Union uses force in Lithuania to 
quell popular support for independence. 
</P>
<P>
There is little, if anything, Western nations can do to respond to Lithuanian 
President Vytautas Landsbergis' appeal for help, diplomats said, beyond urging 
Moscow to use restraint in the crisis in the Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
The rumble of Soviet tanks in the capital of Vilnius stirred memories of 
Moscow's invasion of Budapest in 1956 and Prague in 1968, when the West did not 
respond militarily. The whole rapid movement toward detente between the Soviet 
Union and the West could be reversed if Soviet troops open fire in Lithuania, 
according to sources in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, London and 
Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst in the West German capital declared the Lithuanian situation had 
"loads of implications" and that it could mean that the "Soviet threat was 
coming back." 
</P>
<P>
And a Bonn diplomat declared: "It's a very tricky situation, and we haven't 
made up our minds about what to do -- other than calling for a peaceful 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Many strategic specialists believe that the major victim of the Soviets' use of 
force in Lithuania would be arms reduction, goals being pursued now in talks 
about conventional weapons in Vienna, and about strategic nuclear and chemical 
weapons in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of detente could also slow down progress toward German unification 
as well as the independence movements in Warsaw Pact nations, some sources 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a Soviet move could hurt the whole Western peace process," commented Col. 
Andrew Duncan of the London-based International Institute for Strategic 
Studies. "It would vastly aid those people who have never been keen on 
disarmament. It could probably make the Germans more eager to remain in NATO 
after unity." 
</P>
<P>
Voices in the United States have been louder in support of the Lithuania 
position -- its Parliament voted a unilateral declaration of independence March 
11 -- than in most Western European nations. 
</P>
<P>
However, a meeting of Western European foreign ministers in Lisbon, led by 
Scandinavians who called for greater autonomy for Baltic states, appealed to 
the Soviet Union to resist using its troops in Lithuania. On Tuesday, Norwegian 
Prime Minister Jan P. Syse called Moscow's parading of tanks and its order to 
confiscate Lithuanians' firearms "a shockingly unwise step," and the storming 
of two hospitals by Soviet paratroopers to seize Lithuanian deserters from the 
Red Army "brutal." 
</P>
<P>
"Continued use of power will not solve any problems, but can seriously 
jeopardize the results recently achieved in East-West relations," Syse said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa, the leader of Poland's Solidarity labor movement, wrote to Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, accusing him of "violating the sovereignty of 
Lithuania" and urging that force not be used. 
</P>
<P>
And in Ottawa, Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark called in a senior 
official of the Soviet Embassy to express concern over the military activity in 
Lithuania and warn him that the Soviet actions could impair relations with 
Canada. But some diplomats in European capitals believe that Lithuanian 
President Landsbergis has acted rashly in pushing for immediate independence, 
rather than negotiating with Moscow step by step. 
</P>
<P>
Former British diplomat George Walden, writing in the London Daily Telegraph, 
argued that the Lithuanians had chosen an inappropriate time to make life 
difficult for Gorbachev, and could in effect endanger the whole move toward 
greater freedom and local autonomy in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, a senior NATO official expressed "disquiet" about the Baltic 
situation but said NATO continues to accept Kremlin assurances that force will 
not be used. He pointed out that West European countries could not recognize 
Lithuania's independence because, while it was forcibly incorporated into the 
Soviet Union in 1940, the country did not have control over its affairs -- its 
defense, borders, currency and other national attributes. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply announcing independence isn't enough," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Sture Andersson, in an interview Tuesday with the 
Swedish news agency TT, said, "Sweden considers that the Soviet leadership is 
behaving responsibly toward Lithuania and in accordance with international 
agreements regarding the territory." 
</P>
<P>
He argued that under the 1975 Helsinki accords on European security and 
cooperation, changes in frontiers must be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The British and West German governments have taken a wait-and-see attitude, 
quietly urging Moscow to use restraint, believing that provocative public 
statements will help neither Gorbachev nor the Baltic republics.

GROUP URGES RETENTION OF EMPLOYER SANCTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: IT CALLS FOR A WORKER IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM ALSO. ITS REPORT 
DISCOUNTS JOB BIAS ON EVE OF A STUDY THAT COULD LEAD TO REVOKING THE PENALTIES.

<P>
Anticipating the findings of a General Accounting Office report on employer 
sanctions, the Federation for American Immigration Reform issued a report 
Tuesday calling for continuing penalties against employers who hire illegal 
immigrants and for the creation of a worker identification system. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant rights groups quickly rejected the idea of a worker identification 
system as a civil rights intrusion, arguing that it would be similar to forcing 
residents to carry a national identity card. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based federation, a group that seeks to limit immigration, 
released its report as GAO officials prepared to issue their third and final 
report to Congress on the impact of sanctions against employers. Under a 
provision of the immigration reform law, Congress may change or revoke the 
sanctions if the GAO finds that they caused a pattern of discrimination. That 
report is expected to be released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In its own report, "Making Sanctions Work: The Next Three Years," the 
immigration reform federation contradicted studies that concluded that 
sanctions had caused widespread discrimination by employers against 
foreign-appearing citizens and legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years after their institution, the employer sanctions provisions of (the 
Immigration Reform Control Act) have proven themselves to be generally 
effective and enforceable," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Stein, executive director of the federation, said he has not seen the GAO 
report but predicted that it would not find that discrimination has occurred as 
a result of the immigration reform law. He rejected studies that have found 
discrimination as "based on fatally flawed surveys." 
</P>
<P>
Stein predicted that the GAO report might find "some problems" with the law 
because employers did not know what types of identification to accept from 
prospective employees as verification of a legal right to work in the United 
States. He said that those problems could be fixed easily with the 
implementation of a secure employment identification system, using computerized 
data bases to verify workers' eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Under such a system, all workers would show prospective employers a 
government-issued work authorization document. The document -- which might be 
similar to or ultimately replace the current Social Security card -- could be 
fed into a data base of the nation's eligible workers to determine whether the 
job applicant was in the country legally, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
"Use of the techniques we recommend . . . would eliminate any incentive 
employers may have to discriminate against those who are entitled to work in 
this country," he said. "And, most importantly, the magnet of easy jobs for 
illegal immigrants would be switched off." 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Garcia, national director for immigrant rights at the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the proposal would create a 
"pass-card society" in which some people would be eligible to work and others 
would not. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, among other immigrant rights leaders, cited GAO "sting procedures" to 
detect employer discrimination. In one example, he said, officials with heavy 
Latino accents called New York-area employers and were denied jobs, but callers 
without accents were granted interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"That suggests a predisposition to discriminate," Garcia said. "No document is 
going to solve the problem of discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Among the reports that concluded that sanctions led to discrimination were 
studies by the Mexican American defense fund and the American Civil Liberties 
Union, the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission, the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights and the New York City Commission on Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've reached the point in this discussion that everyone agrees that 
sanctions cause some form of discrimination," Garcia said. "The question is: 
What do we do about it?" 
</P>
<P>
Cecilia Munoz, senior immigration policy analyst with the National Council of 
La Raza, a civil rights organization, said that groups opposed to employer 
sanctions would continue to call for their repeal, no matter what the GAO 
report says.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Staging back-to-back demonstrations outside the main gate of San Quentin prison 
Tuesday, Protestant and Roman Catholic groups opposed to the death penalty 
joined the chorus of religious leaders protesting the scheduled execution of 
Robert Alton Harris next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two protests attracted about 30 people. Spokesmen blamed the small turnout 
on Gov. George Deukmejian's cancellation of a clemency hearing for Harris that 
was to have been held Tuesday. The hearing was aborted when Harris withdrew his 
request for executive clemency, saying he believed that Deukmejian, a staunch 
death penalty supporter, would be biased against him. 
</P>
<P>
The protest leaders predicted that as Harris' scheduled execution nears, their 
ranks will swell. "The vigil will grow," said the Rev. Paul Sawyer, a Unitarian 
minister, referring to a series of planned services and protests. They include 
a march across Golden Gate Bridge on Saturday; a Catholic service led by San 
Francisco Archbishop John R. Quinn at Mission San Rafael on Monday morning and 
an ecumenical vigil and rally Monday evening in Grace Episcopal Cathedral in 
downtown San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' execution would be the first in California in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
"All the great religious leaders of history have spoken out with one voice 
against killing," Sawyer said at Tuesday's protest. "But we, too, are the 
murderers as we stand behind the state, and our hands are on the lever." He was 
referring to the gas chamber mechanism that drops cyanide pellets into a 
mixture of water and sulfuric acid that results in a lethal dose of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer was one of four people arrested for blocking the main entrance to the 
prison after a series of readings, statements, prayers and a role-playing skit 
in which Sawyer and others took turns being strapped into a black wooden chair 
and having a black hood and hangman's noose draped over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
That protest was followed by one led by a statewide delegation of Catholic 
priests and leaders of Catholic social justice groups. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, 17 leaders of major California religious groups issued a statement 
asking Deukmejian to commute Harris' sentence to life in prison without parole 
"based on the established policy statements of our respective denominations 
opposing the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Deukmejian, who is an Episcopalian, Episcopal Bishop Frederick 
H. Borsch of Los Angeles urged him to stop the execution. 
</P>
<P>
And Monday, Mother Teresa, the Nobel Prize-winning nun based in Calcutta, 
India, appealed to the governor in a telephone call to "do what Jesus would do" 
and spare Harris. But Deukmejian stressed that he had a responsibility to carry 
out the law under which Harris was sentenced to die.

Three Iranian oil and natural gas wells near the Iran-Iraq cease-fire line, 
which Iraq set ablaze 19 months ago, are still on fire, and Iraq has refused 
permission to put out the blaze, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from a report by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, IRNA 
said the oil and gas wells are located in the no man's land between Iran and 
Iraq near Dehloran, about 325 miles southwest of Tehran.

SUPERVISORS MAY FUND UNLICENSED AIDS HOSPICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insolvent hospices for people dying of AIDS in Los Angeles County must get the 
cash infusion they need to stay open despite their inability to meet state 
licensing standards, two county supervisors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors held a hearing on the matter and, although no vote was 
taken, Supervisors Ed Edelman and Mike Antonovich supported restoring funding 
that had been cut because the facilities do not fit within current state 
licensing categories and so have not been granted licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The hospices, which provide care for dying patients in a homelike setting, 
cannot meet current hospice licensing standards because, by design, they have 
fewer amenities than nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
At most hospices, there is no full-time medical staff. Instead, the centers 
request nurses as needed from an independent on-call service. 
</P>
<P>
The state has yet to develop licensing criteria for that type of operation, 
city AIDS Coordinator David Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel DeWitt Clinton advised the board that the county faces liability 
problems if it funds unlicensed centers. Board members asked Clinton to advise 
them next week on proposed contracts to reduce that liability if they decide to 
go ahead with the funding. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can wait any longer," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
At least two hospice centers are in danger of closing for lack of money, and 
their employees have been working for free to keep them open.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANDLORD SUES ACTRESS CORNELIA GUEST OVER 
RENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York socialite and aspiring actress Cornelia Guest was sued Monday for 
allegedly not paying the rent on her $5,000-per-month Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court by Guest's landlord, Marlene Morris, 
contends Guest failed to pay rent that was due March 1. Guest rented the house 
on Hutton Drive in May, 1989. In her suit, Morris is seeking to evict Guest and 
receive $25,000 in damages at the rate of $166.67 per day plus punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
Guest, whose renown is based in part on her being "Deb of the Year" of New York 
and a past romantic link to actor Sylvester Stallone, could not be reached for 
comment.

FASHION: SHOPPING FOR A TIE TODAY IS AN ADVENTURE IN A COLORFUL, OFTEN 
EXPENSIVE LAND. MEN CAN CHOOSE FROM ARTISTIC ABSTRACTS, FROLICKING WOMEN AND 
'40S FLORA AND FAUNA.

When Eric Corwin, a KABC sports producer, returned a Christmas-gift shirt to 
Nordstrom, he expected to get a nice tie and perhaps some socks in exchange. 
Instead, he forked out an additional $35 for the tie of his choice and never 
got around to the socks. 
</P>
<P>
At $65, the hand-screened, hand-sewn silk by XMI, cost more than any of 
Corwin's previous ties, but he says it was worth it. Not only does it draw 
constant comments, it weaned him from his old habit of letting girlfriends 
choose $25- to $30-ho-hum styles and turned him into an eager buyer on the 
lookout for ties with clout. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1989 survey conducted for British-based Tie Rack (which 
specializes in $15-to $35-neckwear and has 42 stores in the United States), the 
average American male spends $15 for a tie. 
</P>
<P>
But the "average" fashion hound nationwide spends closer to $50 -- with many of 
them willing to splurge $100 or more for that special little something. 
</P>
<P>
As Corwin quickly learned, shopping for neckwear in 1990 is an adventure in an 
amazing land of expressive, often expensive, colorful expanses (most ties now 
tend to be 3 1/2 to 4 inches wide) covered with everything from artistic 
abstracts and whimsical dots to '40s flora and fauna, frolicking women and 
trompe l'oeil interiors. 
</P>
<P>
The market has exploded with the most exciting designs and patterns anyone can 
remember, thanks to two camps: clothing designers, such as Giorgio Armani, who 
added ties (virtually all of them silk, worn summer and winter) to their 
repertoires; and the witty, innovative neckwear specialists such as Tie Rack, 
Modules, Format, Paul Smith, Howard Behar and Brian Bubb. 
</P>
<P>
On the receiving end are men more interested than ever in shopping for their 
own clothes. As that clothing grows more costly, they have learned a few tricks 
from women. 
</P>
<P>
New ties work wonders on older clothes and stretch a wardrobe: Change the tie 
(and the shirt) and a man can wear the same suit day after day if he has to. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, they allow a man to express his individuality and rise above the 
maddening concept of the blue, black, gray and white corporate world. 
</P>
<P>
The creme de la creme of today's ties do far more than conceal shirt buttons 
and catch crumbs. They're fun but not frivolous, gutsy but not garish. And 
they're not about to be phased into obsolescence. The no-tie look might work at 
night. But for daytime, and for most men, a tie remains the most important 
accessory. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's the icing on the cake. The only choices I have when I get up in 
the morning are the suit and the tie. The rest is always a white shirt, dark 
socks and dark shoes," explains Daniel Riganati, an East Coast executive who 
owns 30 ties and normally pays $25 to $30 "for a decent tie." 
</P>
<P>
But typical of the trend, Riganati's most recent purchase -- a Fendi suggested 
by a saleswoman in Dallas -- cost $50. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like it at first, but then it grew on me," he laughs. "People love 
it. It looks like a lava lamp. It's very primitive, very Fred Flintstone." 
</P>
<P>
Loren Miles, president of Miles Communications Group in Los Angeles, says he 
will go as high as $140 or $150 for his ties. 
</P>
<P>
But his personal average "is usually $80 to $125. I've definitely graduated," 
concedes the 34-year-old executive. "I started out paying $15 to $20." Six 
years ago he got into the expensive clothing habit, which necessitated changes: 
"When you wear an Armani suit, you don't wear a cheap tie with it." 
</P>
<P>
Miles gets the proper reflection from ties by Armani, Byblos, Kenzo, Gianni 
Versaci, Jean Paul Gaultier and Comme des Garcons. Some of which he and his 
wife, who also buys his ties, find at Maxfield on Melrose Avenue, where 
occasionally "they are on sale for $50 or $60, a great price." 
</P>
<P>
Sales are a great way to beat the high cost of ties. So is shrewd shopping in 
discount and thrift stores. (Even Miles has a tie from a thrift store -- but it 
cost $50.) 
</P>
<P>
John Mather, Esquire magazine's fashion editor, suggests one more route: "Our 
readers are buying better but less. Instead of four or five ties, they're 
buying just two that they love." 
</P>
<P>
To recognize a tie worthy of true love, Lorri Maake, president of Tie Rack 
(U.S.) Inc. says turn it over and check for a horizontal strip made of the same 
fabric as the tie and a label, bar tacks (reinforced stitching) and silk facing 
(also known as tipping) at either end of the tie and a loop or a long piece of 
extra thread at the narrow end. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people clip that off, which is a mistake," Maake cautions. "Silk fabric 
stretches during the lifetime of a tie. Unless there is some extra thread 
there, the stitching will bunch." 
</P>
<P>
Feel for a lightweight interlining through the body of the tie. Too much bulk 
will hinder today's fashionable small knot (a four-in-hand is preferred by Alan 
Flusser, the New York retailer-designer-author who created Michael Douglas' 
"Wall Street" wardrobe). 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the outside silk shell "should feel lustrous and supple -- moist 
is the expression we use. You don't want it to feel dry and rough," Maake 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
To go with the custom-tailored clothing Flusser offers in his three East Coast 
shops (two in Manhattan, one in Washington), he stocks $65- and $75-ties made 
by hand in London. 
</P>
<P>
Although he doesn't sell the label, he says: "If there is one status tie 
identified with corporate style today, it is the Hermes" (found locally at the 
Hermes boutique in Beverly Hills and at Neiman Marcus for $95). 
</P>
<P>
If a man can't afford a stack of ties at today's prices, Flusser recommends: 
"Buy something simple that isn't remembered every time you wear it." And never 
send it to the cleaners. "A tie has a certain sponginess to it. When it's 
dry-cleaned and steamed, you loose that character. And in many cases, the spot 
doesn't come out." 
</P>
<P>
Flusser's only advice is to rub the spot while it is still fresh with a clean 
section from the inside of the tie in hopes of removing some of the stain. 
</P>
<P>
Samantha Roldan, Brian Bubb's business partner, also votes against 
dry-cleaning. Her recommendation is: "Baby powder. Sprinkle it on, let it sit 
and brush it off. It's great for absorbing oils." She has also used K2R, a 
spray-on spot remover available in drugstores and supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
To get mileage from a good tie, Roldan suggests: "Buy one with many different 
colors." 
</P>
<P>
Bubb agrees, but points out, "It depends if you're an IBM man or an art 
director. If a man has to wear something subtle, he has to be a little bit 
careful. For me, the requisite is that you really love the tie and feel great 
about it. That supersedes all else." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the high price of ties, Roldan says: "When I started out in the 
industry 15 years ago, you could buy quality silk for about $9.95 a yard. Now 
it's around $23.50 a yard." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Jodi Bynum, divisional merchandise manager for Neiman Marcus: "Any time 
you have more than three colors, you really start building the price, because 
each color requires it's own silk screen." 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at a tie as such a small piece of fabric compared to other 
articles you wear, it does seem to be a great expense," muses well-dressed 
costume designer Michael Kaplan, who buys new ties at Neiman's, Robinson's and 
Clacton &amp; Frinton, a men's boutique in Los Angeles; vintage ties at 
American Rag Cie, in Los Angeles; and orders custom-made neckwear from Byllee , 
also in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In defense of expensive ties ("a $50 tie holds the knot better than a cheaper 
one") Kaplan notes: "I think a tie determines the whole mood of what you're 
wearing. You can have on the most beautiful suit, but if you put on an 
unattractive or cheap tie or one that doesn't go with it, you can ruin the 
whole look." On the other hand, combine a basic suit with a great tie, he says, 
"and you can create the whole look." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan appreciates a strong statement. but cautions: "Ties have their own 
personalities. When you're buying one, you have to be careful it is in sync 
with your personality and what you're trying to say."

LOVE THAT TESTS THE LIMITS OF GLASNOST

<P>
"Are you two crazy?" asked the nonplussed Moscow journalist. 
</P>
<P>
That simple question summed up world reaction to the Feb. 9 marriage between a 
granddaughter of a Cold War President and a top Soviet space scientist who 
advises Kremlin leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Five weeks after the ceremony, sitting in the suburban Washington, D.C., office 
they share, newlyweds Susan Eisenhower and Roald Sagdeyev can recall that 
interview and laugh out loud. But they also vividly remember that it wasn't a 
laughing matter at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are about to go down the aisle the next day," the 38-year-old 
Eisenhower says, "and this reporter from (the liberal newspaper) Moscow News is 
telling us, 'Don't you know that they send people into internal exile for this? 
Or, even worse, to the gulag permanently?' " 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that specter had been haunting the pair for months. While many 
Soviet-American romances have encountered official disapproval -- or worse -- 
over the years, never before had such a prominent East-West couple had so much 
to lose by falling in love. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very painful road just to get here," says Eisenhower, an 
international businesswoman and philanthropist. "It all looks very easy now. 
But we were both all too familiar with how discouraging the track record was. . 
. . The big question was: How substantial has the change of attitude been? It's 
never been tested really." 
</P>
<P>
She didn't feel as if she'd received the answer even when President George Bush 
and former President Richard Nixon both called to offer their congratulations. 
Or even when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, through Politburo members, gave 
tacit approval of the union. Or even when one of their wedding presents was a 
chunk of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
No, not until their wedding announcement ended up on the society pages of U.S. 
newspapers, instead of in news bulletins, did Eisenhower begin to believe that 
the phrase "and they lived happily ever after" might apply to them. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, I would have thought of it as science fiction," says the 
57-year-old Sagdeyev, a lifelong Communist Party member and former director of 
the Soviet Union's Space Research Institute. "But it is, after all, a 
scientist's job to work toward reality." 
</P>
<P>
And the reality is that the Eisenhower-Sagdeyev union is a remarkable symbol of 
the new warmth in East-West relations today, and living proof of Dwight 
Eisenhower's belief in the power of personal diplomacy to develop better 
understanding between the two superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
They're The Glasnost Couple. But say that to their faces, and, suddenly, they 
grow shy. 
</P>
<P>
They are sitting side by side. Their eyes lock on each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like just us to us," the wife says softly. 
</P>
<P>
The husband nods. 
</P>
<P>
Dmitri Simes, Soviet emigre and senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace in Washington, agrees the Eisenhower-Sagdeyev union -- 
the third marriage for her, the second for him -- is "clearly an affair of the 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
"By standing the heat from both the U.S. and Soviets," he says, "their marriage 
has already passed the test of fire." 
</P>
<P>
Until the mid-1980s, love across the Iron Curtain was as painful as getting 
smacked in the face with a sheet of steel. Since the onset of the Cold War, the 
Kremlin has blatantly violated international human rights accords by subjecting 
certain Soviet citizens whose only crime was marrying Americans to 
state-imposed separation from their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, the official reason given was that the Soviet spouses had some 
special knowledge of national security matters. All too often, the sheer act of 
marrying an American would cause the Soviets to lose their jobs. In one case, a 
computer programmer was demoted to amusement park guard; in another, a 
biologist became a menial laborer. Other spouses felt compelled to give up 
their professional positions in the hope it might improve their chances of 
getting permission to leave the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, however, the policy finally began to ease, thanks to some pre-summit 
maneuvering in November before President Reagan and Soviet leader Gorbachev met 
in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
But until the day they were married, Eisenhower and Sagdeyev had to consider 
the "worst-case scenario," she says. "After all, they used to have pretty swift 
solutions. And Roald's a nuclear scientist. He's not a theater director." 
</P>
<P>
Both Eisenhower and Sagdeyev were well aware that, in the past, people in their 
position usually had only two options: defecting or becoming refuseniks. 
Sagdeyev states firmly that he "never" considered defecting. ("And I just 
wouldn't even let it come up for discussion," notes Eisenhower.) Within the 
realm of remaining possibilities was that this widely respected member of the 
Congress of People's Deputies and Academy of Sciences could be stripped of his 
positions, refused travel privileges, even scorned by his countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower didn't know whether marrying a Soviet would subject her to negative 
public opinion, that she was somehow disgracing the Eisenhower name. 
</P>
<P>
Although now those concerns appear groundless, "when they started out, they 
couldn't be sure of that," says Simes. "This is a man and woman who both took 
considerable chances and demonstrated considerable courage." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Moscow and raised in the mostly Moslem Tatar Autonomous Republic, where 
his father was a deputy prime minister, Roald Zinnurovich Sagdeyev studied 
physics at Moscow State University. After graduation, he began a five-year 
stint as a staff member of the Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, where he 
became good friends with fellow physicist Andrei Sakharov. In 1960, Sagdeyev 
was transferred to an "academic town" at Novosibirsk as part of a highly 
skilled Siberian community of scientists and academics Khrushchev had moved out 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
By 1973, he had returned to Moscow to head the Space Research Institute; for 
the next 15 years, he was the international driving force for the Soviet space 
program, with projects involving Halley's comet and Mars, among others. But 
Sagdeyev also gained fame as an independent liberal reformer. In the mid-1970s, 
he became one of the few Academy scientists who refused to denounce Sakharov 
for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. And in 1987 he decried charges in the 
Soviet press that the AIDS virus had been artificially cultivated by the U.S. 
military. 
</P>
<P>
His outspokenness didn't seem to hurt his career. As an adviser to Gorbachev on 
arms control, he attended summits in Geneva and Washington, and in 1989 was one 
of four Soviet officials who testified before the U.S. House Armed Services 
Committee. (He will be UCLA's keynote speaker at principal commencement 
ceremonies for the College of Letters and Sciences June 17.) 
</P>
<P>
Since age 25, Sagdeyev has been one of those lucky Soviets allowed to travel 
abroad. He moved easily in the scientific global village because of his 
excellent English. It was during one of his many trips to the United States, in 
1987, that he first met Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
As one of four children of John S.D. Eisenhower and the product of elite 
private schools, Susan Elaine Eisenhower moved easily within America's most 
powerful military, political and social circles. After making her debut at the 
International Debutante Ball and attending the American College in Paris, she 
married attorney Alexander Bradshaw, who came from a diplomatic background. 
When the seven-year marriage ended, she wed John F. Mahon, another attorney, 
whom she divorced in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
After a stint as a journalist in Rochester, N.Y., she started her own public 
relations company, the Eisenhower Group, and helped found the Eisenhower World 
Affairs Institute to support domestic and foreign programs that deeply 
concerned her grandfather. In 1986, she moved back to Washington, D.C.. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1980s, Eisenhower was a major international figure: Not only was 
she arranging commercial ventures abroad for a number of Fortune 500 companies, 
but she was also a frequent guest at White House state dinners honoring foreign 
dignitaries. She made her first trip to the Soviet Union in 1986 as 
co-chairwoman of a conference on American-Soviet relations aimed at citizen 
diplomacy, sponsored jointly by the Eisenhower Institute and the Chautauqua 
Institution. Sagdeyev was to have attended the forum but begged off at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, the forum took place in Chautauqua, N.Y., and he was there. So 
was Susan Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
At the Chautauqua forum's first dinner party, Sagdeyev introduced himself: "And 
from the very beginning we were engaged in serious communication." 
</P>
<P>
Serious, indeed. "His opening line to me was, 'Do you think your grandfather 
was serious about the identification of the military-industrial complex?' " 
Eisenhower says with a laugh, referring to the famous speech her grandfather 
made Jan. 17, 1961, over nationwide TV. 
</P>
<P>
"And I said, 'Yes, I think he was perfectly serious about it. And we're looking 
forward to having the Soviet Union recognize that they have one, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
And then, Sagdeyev made newspaper headlines by taking a few turns around the 
dance floor with the granddaughter of Dwight Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, the two seemed to run into each other everywhere -- on this 
committee, at that conference, and, finally, in 1988 as allies on the same 
board of directors for the International Foundation for the Survival and 
Development of Humanity, a foundation to promote collaborative research on 
pollution, arms control and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
When a friend asked Eisenhower to see if Sagdeyev would be willing to write his 
memoirs for the American audience, "I ended up helping him put the outline 
together," says Eisenhower, who began collaborating on the book for Bantam with 
him in December 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to know how to date this romance," Eisenhower relates. "We 
started out as deeply close friends. But then the periods of time when we were 
separated actually became increasingly painful. So the issue was: How do we 
manage to be together?" 
</P>
<P>
Roald says the couple began talking marriage when their phone bills reached 
$500 a month. "And as Russia was moving toward a market-controlled economy with 
cost efficiency," he says mischievously, "I saw that this was not cost 
efficient." 
</P>
<P>
They never bothered to hide their romance. They talked openly in hotel rooms 
(that were probably bugged). They met in public (and may have been followed). 
They spoke freely on the telephone (where calls are usually monitored). But 
neither the CIA nor KGB came to visit them about their relationship, "which 
means that they knew from the beginning absolutely everything that was going 
on," according to one insider. 
</P>
<P>
Once they made the decision to marry, Eisenhower decided to tell only her 
sister Anne. "I picked up on it before she actually sat me down and said, 'Hey, 
this is what's going on,' " explains Anne Eisenhower, a New York designer. 
</P>
<P>
When Eisenhower finally broke the news to her mother, the reaction was just as 
low-key. "She said, 'Trust you to be first,' " Eisenhower recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Then the couple decided to tell their respective governments. But they made it 
clear they were going to marry "whether anybody liked it or not," Eisenhower 
says. 
</P>
<P>
When she told various State Department officials, including U.S. ambassador to 
Moscow Jack Matlock, the reaction was cool surprise that grew warmer with time. 
"Everyone I talked to didn't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible to 
pull off," Eisenhower says. 
</P>
<P>
Sagdeyev, meanwhile, told Yevgeny M. Primakov, a member of the ruling Communist 
Party Politburo and a close adviser to Gorbachev. In seconds, he saw Primakov's 
expression change from total astonishment to joy. " 'Well, why not, if you've 
decided,' he said." But he also warned it "was not going to get a standing 
ovation, probably," Sagdeyev says. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, government leaders by the dozen were asking Eisenhower, in the 
nicest tone, where she planned to live after the wedding, as if the choice were 
merely between Chevy Chase or Cleveland Park, and not Moscow or Washington. 
Then Bush hosted a private dinner at the White House in their honor. Attending 
was Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower and Sagdeyev decided to marry in Moscow to demonstrate to their 
Soviet friends that they fully intend to remain part of the community there. 
</P>
<P>
Their Soviet wedding at the Palace of Marriages, was, in a word, unusual. A 
Russian guest wore an authentic "I like Ike" political button. Music from 
"Cats" was played. And the crush of reporters and photographers pinned Anne 
Eisenhower against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
A more elegant second wedding was held afterward at Spaso House, the official 
residence of the U.S. ambassador. The elegant ballroom was transformed into a 
flower-filled wedding chapel, where a Protestant service was conducted. The 
groom said his vows in Russian, the bride in English. One of Eisenhower's three 
daughters served as flower girl. A Greek Orthodox choir provided the music. 
Even Secretary of State James Baker III gave up his right to a Spaso House bed 
so as not to disrupt the wedding preparations. (He missed the wedding, but his 
wife, Susan, attended.) 
</P>
<P>
Among the 300 guests were Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov (a high 
school classmate's of Sagdeyev), Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Sakharov's 
widow Yelena Bonner and Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Since their return from a honeymoon in Budapest, the couple have retained their 
respective citizenships and will make their home in both capitals. They will 
spend the school years in Washington, where they share a home with Eisenhower's 
three school-age children. "I really enjoy family life," says Sagdeyev, who has 
two grown children and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the time they will spend in Moscow, in what they hope will be a 
bigger apartment than the one Sagdeyev currently owns and in a dacha under 
construction in the bucolic countryside by the Moscow River. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the initial hurdle of just getting married is behind them, they both 
intend to continue working for improved East-West relations. "This is one of 
the things we talk about before our second cup of coffee in the morning," 
Eisenhower says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Their life together, says Simes, is "definitely a reflection of new times. Just 
several years ago they would not have an option of living in both capitals. Or 
of Sagdeyev keeping his academic and political connections to Moscow. Or of 
Susan being able to easily travel there. Now they can and neither of them has 
to sacrifice their basic loyalties and principals." 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, about the only thing worrying them right now is whether 
they'll be able to get their dacha built on time and on budget. 
</P>
<P>
Now that's laughable in any country.

GREGORY HINES TAPS HIS TALENT AS STUNT MAN; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: DODGING A MOVING TRAIN IN 'EVE OF DESTRUCTION' IS A CHALLENGE FOR THE 
TAP-DANCER, BUT AFTER EACH TAKE, IT'S 'BOY, NEVER AGAIN!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Producer David Madden grinned as he greeted visitors to his set. "It's going to 
be quite a day. We're putting an expensive actor in front of a moving train." 
</P>
<P>
The expensive actor was Gregory Hines, the former expensive dancer, and the 
particular stunt comes at the climax of "Eve of Destruction," an $11-million 
action-thriller being shot in Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles. In the 
film, Hines plays an expert military marksman who has been sent to terminate an 
android-gone-wrong named Eve VIII. 
</P>
<P>
For this tricky shot, Hines' badly wounded McQuade has cornered Eve VIII on a 
subway track -- actually a 350-foot mock-up created by production designer 
Peter Lamont -- and just as he fires, a train bears down on him from behind. 
The script calls for McQuade to hit the ground and let the train pass over him. 
The film's British director, Duncan Gibbins, had rehearsed the sequence with 
Tierre Turner, Hines' stunt double, but just as the cameras were ready to roll, 
Hines announced that he wanted to do the stunt himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he should do it," worried Dutch actress Renee Renee Soutendijk, 
who plays both Eve VIII and the scientist who creates her in her own likeness. 
</P>
<P>
But Hines says he prefers to do his own stunts. A few weeks before, he flung 
himself into the air near an exploding car. So Gibbins ordered the cameras to 
roll and Hines staggered down the tracks as the train gathered speed behind 
him. (The prop train was going about 27 miles per hour but with the camera 
cranking at 12 frames a second, it will appear to be going twice as fast on the 
screen.) He stopped, aimed his laser-sighting gun and took a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
Stunt coordinator John Moio yelled, "Fire!" 
</P>
<P>
Hines fired, then hurled himself down between the rails and laid still as the 
train passed over him. The Panavision camera, perched over the tracks on a 
special rig, slid abruptly away a second before it would be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"Hold it!" Gibbins called out. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody freeze!" chimed in his assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbins climbed down from the subway platform and peered at his actor, lying 
beneath the train. Hines signaled that he was OK and as he crawled out, the 
crew burst into spontaneous applause. 
</P>
<P>
But a stunt man's work is never done: Duncan repeated the shot five more times. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in his dressing room, Hines shook his head as if questioning his own 
judgment. "That stunt scared me every time. I thought after I did it a couple 
of times, I wouldn't be scared. But it was the sound of that train. After I do 
these stunts, I say, 'Boy, never again!' " 
</P>
<P>
But then again comes, and he does it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to. When I was a kid, I loved action movies. But I could tell when a 
stunt man performed the stunt and not the actor. . . . Once I started making 
films, I would talk to stunt men and, eventually, I asked to do my own stunts." 
</P>
<P>
Walking back to the set, Hines commented on the physical side to acting. "I 
feel like everything I do stems from my ability as a dancer. So these kinds of 
(action) roles, while it's not like dancing, it is choreography. A lot of 
times, I don't have to consciously do any acting. I figure the physical thing 
and whatever's happening on my face -- it's real!" 
</P>
<P>
His director, on this occasion, agrees. "The great movie actors can blend the 
physical and cerebral," Gibbins said. "The payoff in this kind of movie is an 
actor who can stay in character in front of a train moving at 30 m.p.h. If he 
messes up, he can hurt himself badly." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for Gibbins to set up the next shot, the 43-year-old Hines sipped on 
one of the carbohydrate protein drinks he uses daily to maintain his weight. 
Despite his image as a thin dancer, there is surprising muscular bulk in his 
torso and arms. Four years ago, while preparing for his role in "Running 
Scared," Hines accompanied co-star Billy Crystal into the weight room. Hines 
said he's been lifting weights ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I weighed, like, 140 pounds. I was very thin. Now I'm up to 182." 
</P>
<P>
Hines, since 1969, has also held a black belt in karate, and has studied Tae 
Kwan Do. "It's a Korean style that uses mostly kicking techniques," he said. 
"Because of my dance background, it came to me pretty easily. But I don't 
consider myself a black belt anymore -- I haven't maintained the discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Soutendijk, a former national gymnast in Holland, has performed most of her own 
stunts in "Eve of Destruction," too. 
</P>
<P>
A leading lady in Holland and well-known throughout Europe for her work in 
several Paul Verhoeven films ("Spetters," "The Fourth Man"), Soutendijk finds 
herself starting all over in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
"With the unification of Europe coming up in '92, people are putting big (film) 
co-productions together," she said. "And they wind up hiring American stars 
because they're known in all European countries. Now it's almost a necessity 
for European actors to get commercial value over here just to be able to work 
in Europe again." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Madden said Nelson Entertainment, which is financing "Eve of 
Destruction," first offered the dual role of Dr. Simmons and her evil android 
Eve to several bankable American actresses. When they all turned it down, he 
and Gibbins thought about Soutendijk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a grueling part, having to switch back and forth between two roles," 
Madden said. "We needed an actress with a lot of technique. But Nelson 
initially resisted going with a foreign actress with a name no one can 
pronounce." (For the record, it's SAU-ten-deck.") 
</P>
<P>
Later, as he wiped the fake blood off at day's end, Gregory Hines was still 
pumped up. "I really enjoy making movies. I enjoy the process, the 
collaborative effort that goes into it. I get tremendous satisfaction being 
part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 10 years of making films, Hines is eager to concentrate more of 
his energies on this process. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to feel more confident as an actor with each part. What's 
frustrating for me is that, generally, I'm doing one film a year. It's hard to 
get any momentum that way. But it's difficult to find really good parts with 
enough dimension written for a black actor. 
</P>
<P>
"I really love acting and would like to do more. If I did a few movies in a 
row, close together, that would be good." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, thinking about the day he had just put in. "You know, as I was 
getting ready to do that stunt, I thought, 'Boy, this is the kind of stuff I 
always wanted to do.' "

SMALLEST AUDIENCE IN THREE YEARS FOR THE OSCAR TELECAST; 
</P>
<P>
RATINGS: THE SHOW IS SEEN IN 25.7 MILLION HOMES COMPARED WITH 27 MILLION LAST 
YEAR. EVEN SO, IT DEMOLISHED THE COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Academy Awards telecast on ABC Monday night was seen in 25.7 million U.S. 
homes, the smallest audience for the glitzy ceremony in three years, the A.C. 
Nielsen Co. said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Oscar show, which was criticized for its campiness and slapped with 
a lawsuit for its unauthorized use of the Disney-copyrighted character Snow 
White, was seen in about 27 million homes across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Though viewer interest was down, this year's far more stoic broadcast -- one TV 
critic called it "dismayingly tiny" -- nonetheless grabbed 48% of the available 
audience and steamrolled its competition on the other three networks. NBC 
earned only a 15% share of Monday's prime-time audience, CBS received a 13.5% 
share and Fox managed a 7.5% share for its two hours of programming. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy Oscar telecast fared much better, however, in the nation's larger 
television markets. In Los Angeles, for example, nearly 2 million television 
sets -- watched by an estimated 5 million residents -- were tuned to the 
internationally flavored broadcast that honored the movie industry's 
achievements of 1989. And though the announcement that "Driving Miss Daisy" had 
been named best picture was not made until just after 12:30 a.m. on the East 
Coast, a whopping 61% of the available audience in New York, the nation's 
largest television market, watched the show. 
</P>
<P>
But in nearly all Eastern communities, the total audience dropped off sharply 
as the ceremony wore on into the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Cates, the producer of Monday's telecast, did try to limit the length 
of the show by imposing a 45-second clock on most of the acceptance speeches, 
but the telecast still ran 3 hours and 37 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that (the Academy Awards) can go on too long," Cates said in a 
phone interview Tuesday. "It's a grand event. An event that is outsized. One 
that is large and imposing, one with its own dimensions. You can't equate it 
with the traditional compulsive way you treat a two-hour TV movie or a sitcom. 
It's like you went to a dinner and there's talk and dinner and entertainment; 
who knows how long it will take?" 
</P>
<P>
Monday's telecast featured satellite linkups with Moscow, London, Buenos Aires 
and Sydney, Australia, in an effort to lend a feeling of global solidarity to 
the broadcast. The coup de gras of the technical wizardry came late in the 
broadcast when Diana Ross led people on five continents in an "everybody sing" 
rendition of "Over the Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
The satellite hookups, which have become routine on news programs such as 
"Nightline," came off with only a few minor technical flaws. 
</P>
<P>
From Moscow, the voices of Jack Lemmon and Soviet actress Natalya Negoda echoed 
thunderously through the Soviet auditorium and then across the satellite bridge 
back to Los Angeles for several minutes until technicians in Moscow turned off 
their public address system. Cates wistfully suggested that the annoying 
feedback "lent authenticity" to the whole experience of linking such far-flung 
locales. 
</P>
<P>
"The Academy Awards shows always reflect the year in which they were done, and 
the better shows reflect the year more accurately," Cates said, explaining the 
idea behind the international hookups. "In 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. 
Look what happened in Czechoslovakia and in Africa. The world is getting 
smaller. So I think the feeling that we are part of an international community 
best reflected the year of movies we were celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
ABC estimated that 1 billion people around the world watched the annual parade 
of Hollywood's elite, which was seen live via satellite in 39 countries. 
Another 50 nations -- from Abu Dhabi to Zimbabwe, the Soviet Union to China -- 
have licensed a 90-minute version of the broadcast for use in the future. This 
year, the Oscar telecast will be seen in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Morocco 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"The Barbara Walters Special," which preceded the awards show on ABC in the 
East and followed it here on the West Coast, was seen in 18.7 million homes by 
33% of those watching television at the time.

TUNING IN TO CATCHY SLOGANS; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: 'CLASSIC ROCK' AND 'MORE MUSIC' MAY SEEM LIKE LIGHTWEIGHT CLAIMS, BUT 
THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT GO INTO SUCH SAYINGS IS BIG BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Choosing from among the more than 80 radio stations in Southern California can 
be a confusing, even mind-boggling experience. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a nostalgic sort, do you tune in to the station "with more of your 
favorite oldies" (KRTH-FM)? Or to the one with "all oldies all the time" 
(KRLA-AM)? What about "non-stop oldies" (KODJ-FM)? 
</P>
<P>
There's also the option of the "only station for classic rock" (KLSX-FM). And 
another with "more music, more memories" (KLIT-FM). 
</P>
<P>
If it's information you're seeking, you might prefer the station with "more 
traffic, more often" (KNX-AM). But then what about the one that boasts of 
featuring "twice the traffic" (KFI-AM)? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if you're stuck in twice the traffic, you'll actually find the time to 
sample all these stations. If you do, you'll find many slogans that are at best 
silly and nondescriptive, and, at worst, patently untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Take the claim being made by KXEZ-FM (formerly KJOI) that it is the "the only 
station for easy music." What about KBIG-FM, KOST-FM, KSRF-FM and KLIT-FM, 
which also play soft hits or "easy music?" 
</P>
<P>
Though slogans -- called "position statements" by the radio industry -- may 
seem like lightweight stuff, their research, development and selection is 
indeed big business. 
</P>
<P>
"They have these things tested and they spend lots of money on research," said 
J. Rae Padden, president of the local chapter of the Radio Advertising Bureau. 
"Somebody just doesn't walk in one morning and say, 'Let's say 'The Big Mix.' . 
. . Every station slogan -- whether you think it's good, bad or indifferent -- 
has been costed out and researched." 
</P>
<P>
The best slogans are catchy and pithy, according to broadcast consultant John 
Lund. 
</P>
<P>
"A slogan should be, in a nutshell, what's good in a radio station and gets you 
to listen," Lund said. It should also be, he noted, "unique, credible and 
beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
But credibility appears to be the least valued of the criteria. Truth in radio 
sloganeering is not strictly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
For example, KLSX contends that it is "the one station that everyone at work 
can agree on." KOST makes the same statement in one of its slogans. Are there, 
instead, two stations that everyone at work can agree on? Have employees even 
been polled on this matter? 
</P>
<P>
Jumping on the bandwagon when a slogan appears successful is a favorite pastime 
for radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the slogan) 'power pig' becomes a sensation in Tampa, then all of a sudden 
you've got stations all over the country calling themselves 'the power pig,' " 
said Ken Barnes, managing editor of Radio and Records, an industry publication. 
"To use another animal metaphor, it's very lemming-like." 
</P>
<P>
Station officials generally defend the practice of sloganeering, citing the 
advertising potential of the phrases. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're accentuating your positive and you say it enough times, it 
eventually will pay off," said KODJ promotion director Nicole Sandler. "Where 
it doesn't pay off is if it's not describing anything or if it's not true, then 
you're working against yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"They help you describe either how you perceive yourself to be or what they 
tell you you are, or what you hope you are," said Bob Griffiths, KXEZ-FM (98.7) 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they seem to beat listeners over the head with a simple concept. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to extrapolate that if KLSX is "the only 
station for classic rock," then it also plays "the most classic rock." And 
given those assertions, then there's no question that "at work, at home or in a 
car, when you hear classic rock, it's 97.1 KLSX." 
</P>
<P>
What exactly constitutes "classic rock" anyway? How does "classic rock" differ 
from those other classics that some call "oldies"? 
</P>
<P>
"In my definition, there's classic hits and there's classic rock," said Steve 
Ellis, KLSX program director. "You can hear classic hits on KODJ, KRLA, KRTH. 
We're classic rock. We're the Doors, the Who, Led Zeppelin and the Stones, and 
there's not another station doing that." 
</P>
<P>
But all those groups can be heard on the "the home of rock 'n' roll," KLOS-FM 
(95.5), just to the left of KLSX on the dial, as well as on at least half a 
dozen other stations. 
</P>
<P>
Although slogans are considered serious business by most station officials, 
some radio stations like to poke fun at the entire notion. KROQ-FM (106.7) 
boasts of being "the only Southern California station that doesn't call 
Wednesday 'hump day.' " "Pirate radio" KQLZ-FM (100.3) tells listeners, "Our 
ratings are so low it doesn't matter what we do."

<P>
A key function of a slogan, said Radio and Records' Barnes, is to inspire 
listeners to remember the station -- especially if they are selected to be 
surveyed by a ratings service. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is for that slogan to come out when they fill out that Arbitron diary 
or get a call from Birch (survey service)," Barnes said. "If you sledgehammer 
them enough with it, it will come to mind. You're not necessarily looking to 
make a profound, conscious impression. You're just trying to sink a hook into a 
listener's sub-conscious." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, a slogan lacking in cleverness and originality may actually be to 
a station's advantage, posited consultant Lund. 
</P>
<P>
"If it requires you to think about it, you're down the tubes because the masses 
are bombarded with tens of thousands of advertising messages each day," Lund 
said. "And thinking is not something that the American public should be 
required to do when making a brand decision."

<P>
ART: NINE USC GRADUATE STUDENTS RESEARCHED, INSTALLED AND CURATED THE 'ROMAN 
PORTRAITURE' SHOW AT THE FISHER GALLERY.

"Roman Portraiture: Images of Character and Virtue," an exhibition of 14 marble 
portraits on loan from the J. Paul Getty Museum, opens today at USC's Fisher 
Gallery. Most visitors will assume that this exhibition and its accompanying, 
fully researched catalogue were prepared by the museum's staff. After all, the 
exhibition, because it deals with antiquities, may be considered more complex 
than the average contemporary art show. 
</P>
<P>
But in fact it was put together as a class assignment for the nine students of 
the university's museum studies program class of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew in my mind that there would be a lot involved in doing this exhibition, 
but until you're actually doing it, you just don't realize how much," said 
student Laura Cogburn -- who, like her eight classmates, is completing her 
masters degree in art history as part of the three-year program. 
</P>
<P>
The museum studies program, run by Fisher Gallery Director Selma Holo, was 
established eight years ago and has graduates working at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art and the Norton Simon, J. Paul Getty and Laguna Art museums. 
Graduates also work at more distant institutions such as the prestigious 
Brooklyn Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, National 
Gallery of Art in Washington, and Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening with the program is that it's becoming real national," said 
Holo. "It's no longer a regional thing. Now we're providing curators back East. 
The quality of Western-trained and educated kids is becoming known. We're 
providing people for the whole country." 
</P>
<P>
Curating an original exhibition (past museum studies shows have included 
"Romance With Nature: 19th Century American Landscapes" in 1989, "A Selection 
of British Paintings" in 1988 and "Masterworks from the 16th &amp; 17th 
Centuries" in 1987) is only a part of the museum study program's practical 
aspects. In the first year, each class -- which normally has only five to seven 
students -- selects a work of art to purchase for the Fisher Gallery's 
permanent collection. A budget of $1,000 is provided for this purchase. Then in 
the third year, students serve internships at prestigious museums throughout 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the hands-on preparation of the exhibition that takes up much of the 
students' time during the program's first two years. Although Holo and the art 
history faculty select the actual exhibitions, the rest of the work -- from 
researching individual artworks, to building display pedestals, to sending out 
reception invitations -- is done by the students. 
</P>
<P>
The students' work on "Roman Portraiture," which is on view through April 20, 
actually began last year. Under the direction of faculty member John Pollini, a 
noted specialist in Roman classical art, each student selected and researched 
one portrait (in most cases these are heads of individual Roman figures such as 
Julius Caesar, but a couple of marble funerary reliefs are also included). 
</P>
<P>
Through their research, which appears in the exhibition catalogue, the students 
determined not only who the portraits represented, but also where they were 
made, what type of marble was used, and the date each was sculpted. Some 
students even found evidence suggesting the portraits were not indeed who or 
what they had previously been thought to be. 
</P>
<P>
"My piece had previously been identified as three different people -- 
Germanicus, Drusus Julius and Nero Julius, and Nero Julius is who I say it is," 
said Kathryn Kanjo, noting that she based her findings on evidence such as the 
bridge of the portrait's nose and its hairstyle. "We've used the standard 
scholarly procedure," said Kanjo, who added that the Getty has supported the 
students' research, even when it differed with previous findings. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of the research, the majority of work on the exhibition began last 
September, and the students said that since January, they have each spent an 
average of 20 hours a week on activities such as planning the show's 
installation and accompanying educational programs, sorting out the budget and 
doing press relations. 
</P>
<P>
The work has taught them many things, the students said, including the value of 
teamwork, the need to make compromises, and the tricks of working within a 
fairly strict budget (Holo said the exhibition's total budget was about 
$20,000, which included many in-kind services provided by the Getty, such as 
insurance and shipping costs). 
</P>
<P>
And because of the Getty's involvement (this is the first time the museum has 
collaborated closely with Fisher Gallery) the students said that they have 
learned how to do things in the ideal way, even though they realize that the 
institutions they will work at may not have the financial and other resources 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with the Getty makes you very conscious of each step," said student 
Jennifer Easton. "They have a whole other realm of standards that other 
(institutions) can't meet."

SHERIFF AWARDED JOB OF POLICING NEW 'BLUE LINE' ; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: RTD BOARD BOWS TO PRESSURE AND VOTES TO GIVE THE DUTY TO DEPUTIES -- 
RATHER THAN THE AGENCY'S OWN POLICE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Buckling under intense lobbying from county supervisors and the mayor of Los 
Angeles, RTD directors Tuesday reversed a previous decision and voted to have 
sheriff's deputies -- and not its own police force -- protect the new Long 
Beach-Los Angeles light-rail line. 
</P>
<P>
"We succumbed to political pressure. That's the truth," said Southern 
California Rapid Transit District board President Gordana Swanson after the 7-1 
vote. "It had nothing to do with our (transit officers') ability to do the job. 
It had everything to do with politics." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote settles a long-running dispute between the RTD and the county 
Transportation Commission, which is financing the $871-million "Blue Line" and 
has been pressing for the district to hire sheriff's deputies to police it. 
Commission officials say they believe the deputies are better-equipped to 
handle the job. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line, set to open July 16, runs through areas of South-Central Los 
Angeles that are plagued by gang violence and drug use. Rail experts agree that 
its success -- as well as the success of other lines planned for elsewhere in 
the county -- depends upon riders feeling safe enough to board the trains. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan accepted by the board Tuesday, the Sheriff's Department will 
hold the contract for policing the 22-mile line during its first two years of 
operation. The sheriff will provide a special force of 126 officers, 
investigators and supervisors to patrol the trolley line, at a cost to the 
commission of $9.9 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
RTD board members, meanwhile, said they intend to beef up the district's own 
police force during the two-year period so that the transit officers can take 
over when the contract with the sheriff expires. 
</P>
<P>
But that was little comfort to the three dozen or so transit police officers 
who attended Tuesday's meeting. After the vote, the grim-faced officers left 
the room, grumbling that morale, which has been a problem in the past, may now 
sink even lower. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a slap in the face," said Frank Bielman, president of the 
Southern California Transit Police Officers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he does not believe the sheriff will give up the job after two 
years: "Once the camel's got his nose in the tent, he's all the way in." 
</P>
<P>
RTD officers have complained that the Sheriff's Department is nosing in on 
their turf and have also said that they can provide security for $4 million a 
year less. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Jester, the commission's director of rail activation, said money is not 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a turf issue," he said. "This was not a dollars-and-cents issue. 
This was an issue that had the safety of the public at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Jester praised the RTD board for making what he said was a tough decision to 
reverse itself. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not an easy topic to resolve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson said representatives of Mayor Tom Bradley and the county supervisors 
"put a great deal of pressure on us," particularly on board members who are 
political appointees. Seven of the board's 11 members are appointed, two by the 
mayor and five by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Board Vice President Marvin Holen said he cast the lone dissenting vote because 
the plan does not provide a specific date for the RTD to begin training its own 
officers to take over policing of the line. He said the lack of such a date 
would undermine the district's ability to "maintain the morale and the 
integrity" of the transit police force. 
</P>
<P>
The board's vote, taken during a special meeting, came at the last possible 
minute for the Sheriff's Department, which had insisted that if a decision were 
not made by Tuesday, deputies would not have adequate time to prepare for the 
opening of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson said the timing was also a factor in the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been going on for much too long," she said. "We wanted to settle it 
and we wanted to get on with it. We cannot jeopardize the safe start-up of the 
line."

LANDLORD FIGHTS BACK; 
</P>
<P>
HE HAS TENANTS ON HIS SIDE IN BATTLING ANTI-SLUM CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Devanand Sharma owns a quiet apartment complex in the midst of a troubled 
Westlake neighborhood where heroin addicts and youthful gang members control 
the public alleyways and clamber across people's rooftops to elude police. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the grim surroundings, longtime tenants of the complex, many of them 
poor, said they always considered the building a pleasant place to live -- in 
fact "one of the nicest" in the Westlake district. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants say Sharma does not raise the rent every year, as he could under city 
rent laws, and responds promptly to reports of broken appliances or plumbing. 
The graffiti left by gangs is regularly painted over. 
</P>
<P>
So the tenants were surprised to learn that Sharma was sued March 1 by the city 
attorney, who in a stinging press release described a neglected hovel filled 
with falling plaster, filth and rodents. 
</P>
<P>
Sharma, who has vowed to clear his name, believes he is a victim of guilt by 
association. In its press release, the city attorney linked Sharma to his older 
brother, Vijaynand, who was sentenced in 1988 to 23 months in prison for scores 
of building code violations and is now a fugitive. The Vijaynand Sharma case 
received heavy media coverage in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is this case in court?" Devanand Sharma asked. "They (the city) did not 
try to work with me, not even for one day, to come up with reasonable deadlines 
for the major work. I feel that the city attorney saw my last name -- Sharma -- 
and said, 'Can we catch him in some act? Can we throw any violations at him?' " 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Richard Bobb, contends that Sharma "was not treated any 
differently than anyone else" who is targeted by the city attorney's aggressive 
anti-slum task force. 
</P>
<P>
On March 1, Bobb told The Times that Sharma had neglected the 30-unit complex 
at 737 S. Westlake Ave. to the point of "making it really disgusting," and 
said: "You would think he would have learned from the mistakes of his brother." 
</P>
<P>
Sharma, a respected Hawthorne-area restaurateur and hotelier and a member of 
that city's redevelopment Project Area Committee, pleaded not guilty to 26 
building code violations last Friday. He refused Bobb's offer to dismiss all 
but a few charges in exchange for a guilty plea and a small fine. 
</P>
<P>
Sharma said he is "just sick," over the lawsuit and the "dredging up of my 
brother's case after all that my mother and my family went through." 
</P>
<P>
But Bobb said: "If we targeted him for prosecution because of his brother, we 
would have looked up all the properties he owned, and we didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Sharma case was given unusual prominence by a formal press release 
that described his brother's conviction and pointedly stated that Vijaynand 
Sharma was once a partner in the Westlake building. Twelve years ago, Vijaynand 
was listed on the deed -- for two weeks, according to property records. But 
Devanand Sharma said his brother was never his partner. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, descriptions of the Westlake building issued by the city attorney's 
office do not match conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in early March, a reporter and photographer visiting the complex found no 
evidence of filth, rats or obvious slum conditions. The 70-year-old brick 
building was worn but clean, with carpeted hallways and apartments that showed 
signs of tenant care. 
</P>
<P>
Several tenants asked why the city is "going after the landlord" instead of 
tackling gaping problems such as the public alley that has become a homeless 
encampment without toilets, or the piles of garbage accumulating along a curb 
where city sweepers rarely appear, or the heroin addicts who can plainly be 
seen shooting up at midday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 16 pleasant years and I'd like to say something to the (city)," 
said a perturbed Betty Fordham, 57. "There are much worse things in life than a 
few roaches or a little old paint on the wall. . . . It's not Beverly Hills, 
but it has always been perfectly livable." 
</P>
<P>
Expressing a fear voiced by other tenants, she said: "The Health Department had 
better start cleaning the streets outside, because that's where people are 
going to live when they can't afford the high rents caused by all this 
unnecessary beautifying." 
</P>
<P>
During both visits by The Times, large crews were working to complete 
city-ordered repairs -- replacing broken smoke detectors, old sinks and 
bathtubs, repairing kitchen cabinets and doorways, and inspecting the aging 
heating and electrical systems. 
</P>
<P>
But two weeks later, on March 20, Bobb told The Times that Sharma had "polished 
some copper pipes and planted flowers, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Bobb had not yet seen the building and was relying instead on 
reports from city and county inspectors. Based on those reports, he decided to 
continue pursuing the matter in court. 
</P>
<P>
He said Sharma "had not made a good-faith effort" since first being cited late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"With a good-faith effort, we will grant time extensions before going to 
court," Bobb said. "One man working on a building is not good faith, and I 
don't believe he has even one man working on the electrical updating that's 
needed. I told (Sharma) it's too late to stay out of court." 
</P>
<P>
Bobb said he visited the building March 21 "and I have told Mr. Sharma I am 
impressed with the work he has done. I saw a tremendous amount of work, and if 
it is up to code by the trial date (April 26) I will recommend only a small 
fine and probation." 
</P>
<P>
But probation and a fine "are only for someone who is guilty, and I have never 
been a slumlord," Sharma said angrily, responding to Bobb's comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bobb insists that there were serious problems with Sharma's building. 
</P>
<P>
When inspectors first cited Sharma late last year, then reinspected the 
building on Jan. 9 "they found a slum," Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
However, most tenants seem to agree that Sharma has been a decent landlord. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager has been strict about keeping the bad elements out of here," said 
Alberta Villa, a mother of six who has lived in the building for five years. 
"In the last two months they have repaired my kitchen, new baseboards, new 
tiles, new carpet. It's fine now -- but it was fine before." 
</P>
<P>
Most important to tenants, Sharma does not raise the rent every year. And, 
according to city rent officials, he has never applied for a special rent 
increase to recoup the extensive cost of earthquake safety work and sprinkler 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
Sharma said he spent $155,000 on the messy seismic repair job and completed it 
well before his city-issued deadline later in the 1990s. Crews ripped up 
support walls throughout the building -- as required by the city -- and 
installed braces that will help the building withstand an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
It was during that work in late November, city records show, that building and 
health inspectors made their first surprise visit. Among numerous citations 
issued to Sharma were some noting falling plaster and debris. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a bad joke," Sharma said. "I got a violation for doing 
construction required by the city to make the building safe." 
</P>
<P>
Bobb responded that seismic work may have created some of the mess, but said it 
"would not cause missing smoke detectors, broken fire doors, and no heat in 
some apartments." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Sharma says he "can only believe this is about my brother. Now we 
will just have to see how things turn out in court."

BILL BOYARSKY: THE WANING DAYS OF DYNASTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not easy to create a political dynasty these days, as Pete Schabarum is 
finding out. 
</P>
<P>
Once it was standard procedure. Schabarum himself was the designated heir of 
the previous 1st District supervisor, Frank Bonelli. As Bonelli lay dying of 
cancer in 1972, the businessmen who dominated district politics caucused 
secretly at a country club to pick a successor. When Bonelli died, Gov. Ronald 
Reagan was persuaded to appoint Schabarum, then a state assemblyman, who was 
subsequently elected. 
</P>
<P>
Suffering from job burnout this year, Schabarum looked for a successor who 
would be another Schabarum. A couple of politicians refused the honor. But his 
offer was finally accepted by Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien, who was then 
endorsed by the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien is an earnest, friendly man who graduated in journalism from USC, was a 
press secretary for a Republican congressman and became a lawyer. Republican 
Party volunteer work in the San Gabriel Valley, where he grew up, helped him 
win a judicial appointment from Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum became friendly with O'Brien when the judge appealed to him for 
increased courtroom space in the San Gabriel Valley. They began breakfasting at 
the Holiday Inn in West Covina, which is where Schabarum popped the 
supervisorial question. 
</P>
<P>
But someone else wanted the job. Her name is Sarah Flores, and she's worked for 
Schabarum for 18 years, first as secretary and now as assistant chief deputy. 
Before that, she was Supervisor Bonelli's secretary. I met her in 1972 when I 
was storming around Bonelli's office, demanding the facts on his rapidly 
deteriorating health. Flores was patient with my ranting, although refusing me 
a medical report. 
</P>
<P>
She is today what she was then -- a smart, determined women, traditional in her 
values and conservative in her politics. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's fellow Republicans on the Board of Supervisors, Mike Antonovich and 
Deane Dana, have endorsed Flores, as has the Republican sheriff, Sherman Block. 
They'll bring in campaign contributions, balancing Schabarum's legendary 
fund-raising ability. 
</P>
<P>
An intriguing aspect of the contest is that the Flores and O'Brien families 
live within two blocks of each other in Glendora. Both families attend St. 
Dorothy's Catholic Church and they have children at St. Lucy's High School. 
When O'Brien is working in the front yard and Flores drives by, she sometimes 
stops to chat. 
</P>
<P>
As I talked to Flores and O'Brien, it became clear that Schabarum's maneuvering 
had misfired. He had hoped for a clear path for O'Brien. But his ham-handed 
manner has fueled a hotter race than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
His first mistake was not telling Dana and Schabarum of his behind-the-scenes 
action. Caught unprepared, they blew up and endorsed Flores. 
</P>
<P>
That was a surprise to O'Brien. He had known there was tension among 
Republicans on the board. But he didn't realize how bad it was. After watching 
Dana and Antonovich blast Schabarum on television, he told the supervisor, 
"Don't you think it's time for you to introduce me to your colleagues?" 
Schabarum thought it over, O'Brien said, and then wisely counseled that "it 
might be better to introduce yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's second mistake was his rude treatment of Flores. In a gratuitous 
insult of a loyal aide, Schabarum said, "Sarah does not have the educational 
background . . . the organizational talents, nor . . . the personal skills . . 
. " to succeed him. Flores is respected and popular in the County Hall of 
Administration. Antonovich, Dana and Block think highly of her. And some women 
in county politics are particularly angry at what they consider the strongly 
sexist tone of the Schabarum insult. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Schabarum acted without taking into consideration the political needs 
of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans want to increase their vote among middle-class Latinos. Schabarum's 
once solidly Anglo 1st District, which covers Southeast Los Angeles County and 
the San Gabriel Valley, is becoming increasingly Latino. If Sarah Flores 
represents that area on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, she'll be 
a powerful symbol of a GOP-Latino connection. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the existing lines of the 1st District will be radically changed 
if the county is found guilty of anti-Latino gerrymandering when a pending 
federal Voting Rights Act lawsuit is decided. The number of Latinos in that 
district would probably increase. Flores, as an incumbent supervisor, would 
give the Republicans a strong candidate. 
</P>
<P>
All this -- Latino political power, politically influential women, a badly 
divided Board of Supervisors -- have come since Schabarum became Frank 
Bonelli's political heir. That was 18 years ago. The days of dynasties are 
ending.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO SAVE MULHOLLAND VISTAS GETS 
ENDORSEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to preserve the view from the city's most famous scenic roadway, the 22 
miles of Mulholland Drive, was approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council 
Planning and Land Use Management Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The panel unanimously endorsed the plan after more than two hours of debate 
between property owners, environmentalists and fans of the winding road on the 
crest of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted by the full council, the plan would regulate the height and location 
of buildings, fences and walls along Mulholland Drive from the Hollywood 
Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard. It also proposes construction of a bicycle 
path and a trail along the roadside for walkers, joggers and equestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Landowners say the plan would rob them of their property rights by making 
thousands of parcels virtually impossible to develop.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FERRARO SEES LIKELIHOOD OF WATER RATIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro on Tuesday said "there is a strong 
possibility" that Los Angeles will resort to water rationing this summer in the 
face of a projected 12% shortfall in water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But Ferraro, following a council committee hearing on the Department of Water 
and Power's projections, said he does not believe that strict enforcement 
methods are necessary or cost-effective in saving water. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have responded in the past and they will again" answer the call to 
reduce water usage and honor rationing levels, Ferraro said. "We can't expect 
the police . . . to check on every leaky water faucet," he said.

A SPECIAL TEACHER UNIFIES HER CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Marianne Stjern walked into her classroom at Webber Elementary School for 
the first time last September, she thought she had entered her worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
It was chaos, with the children out of control and not showing any respect for 
their Swedish-born teacher, who was in charge of a fifth grade in the United 
States for the first time. At the end of that disastrous day, a dispirited 
Stjern marched to Principal Richard Weaver's office and quit. 
</P>
<P>
But Weaver and district administrators had a special feeling about Stjern and 
persuaded her to give the class another try. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hire teachers, I look for people who have that spark, who are excited 
and have a love of teaching and I saw that in Marianne," said Barbara Winars, 
assistant superintendent of personnel services. "She has tremendously high 
standards, and she was unsure that she could do a good job. But I knew she was 
the best thing that could have happened to those kids." 
</P>
<P>
Now, seven months later, Stjern, 36, has proven Winars' instincts correct as 
she now presides over what she describes as a controlled, although still 
energetic, group of students. She said the turning point came in December when 
she taught the melting pot of Latino, Vietnamese and Caucasian children a 
Swedish Christmas song called "Santa Lucia." 
</P>
<P>
"That's when we really got together," Stjern said, her Swedish accent still 
apparent after eight years in the United States. "We had a special bond because 
we all knew Swedish. After that, I was excited to come back in January and 
begin the second half of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Stjern wondered during Christmas vacation how she could build on the momentum 
she had gained in order to further unify the class, which had a tendency to 
divide into racial cliques. 
</P>
<P>
That opportunity came when the 34 students began their study of the United 
States. As a way to help the children remember where the states were, Stjern 
had them begin work on a giant, quilt-like map that was completed just last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful quilt is the focal point of the portable classroom where Stjern 
and her students spend their day. With its plethora of colors and designs, it 
is a symbol of their unity and continues to serve as a learning tool. 
</P>
<P>
"During recess or at lunch, some of the kids will come into the classroom and 
quiz each other on the states on their own time," Stjern said. "It's fun for 
them and it's good for me to see them so excited about learning." 
</P>
<P>
Paula Ramos, 10, proudly said that she was the first student to remember the 
locations of all 50 states. Ramos, her dark brown hair in a braid, smiled shyly 
when asked about her popular teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's just so nice and so funny," Paula said. "She tells us about 
where she used to live and she has a really neat accent." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smith, 10, said the students like Stjern because she has made learning 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
"She thinks different from any other teacher I've had," Mike said. "She makes 
every subject, even math and spelling, fun. She's really smart and artistic 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to the education system in the United States has been difficult for 
Stjern. In Sweden, teachers get a fourth-grade class and follow it for three 
years. Then, they follow the same students in one subject for three years after 
that. Stjern wishes she could spend a similar length of time with her present 
students, instead of only one year. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I know these kids," Stjern said, "I have them where I want them only to 
have to let them go." GREG HERNANDEZ

<P>
DAY-CARE OPERATORS ASSAIL NEW PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a lack of customers, operators of small, private day-care centers said 
Monday that they fear an ambitious plan to provide additional child care in the 
city will force them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Family Care Plan, adopted last week by a consortium of city, 
business and school district officials, would provide up to 80 spaces at a 
renovated train station and up to 125 spaces in a new building by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"It scares us," said Grace Romo, owner of Happy Days and La Palma Preschools in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Although licensed for 75 children ages 2 to 6, the Happy Days school has 
enrolled only 20 children, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are empty. It's true of everybody around here," she said. "If they build 
these new schools and they'll be open in 1991, we will be out of business." 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen day-care and preschool owners in the area are scheduled to attend 
a meeting at 10 a.m. Thursday at Romo's center to talk over the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Romo said city researchers were misinformed about the need for day care in 
Anaheim. "Where are they getting their information for slots they can't find?" 
Romo asked. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Swaim, Anaheim's director of community services, said a city study last 
year showed that child care was among the top concerns of residents. Using raw 
census data, a consultant projected that there will be between 15,474 and 
24,000 children up to age 4 in the city by the year 2000, he said. There are 
now 16,000 children in this age group. 
</P>
<P>
Based on those figures and on testimony given at four public forums, Swaim said 
consortium members figured that there was at least a "potential need" for child 
care in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Calderon, director of Li'l Toots Preschool in Anaheim, said she also saw 
a need for after-school care but noted that "we've always had too many schools 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, the money should go to supplying child care for those children 
who can't afford it," Calderon said, "certainly not building two huge schools 
like that. " 
</P>
<P>
She said she has 35 children enrolled and is licensed for 44. She charges $59 a 
week for up to 10 hours a day with lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Romo said she charges $68 for a 40-hour week with a hot lunch at Happy Days and 
La Palma Preschool. LYNN SMITH

CHEMICAL SPILLS INTO CANAL AT TIMES PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several gallons of fluid spilled from an air-conditioning unit at The Times 
Orange County plant Tuesday and flowed into storm drains, but the solution 
never reached a drainage canal, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred as a crew was working on rooftop air-conditioning 
equipment at the Sunflower Avenue plant, where three past spills recently 
resulted in $30,000 in fines to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa fire officials said that less than five gallons reached a storm 
drain on the newspaper plant's property and that the flow was so minimal that 
it never left Times property. 
</P>
<P>
A Times executive said the spill Tuesday involved the same rust inhibiting 
solution that had been accidentally dumped in storm drains in two of the three 
past incidents. The third spill involved a highly diluted solution of 
developing fluid used in the printing process.

<P>
FISHING BOAT RUNS AGROUND NEAR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 57-foot fishing boat Sharkfin was towed to safety early Tuesday, more than 
an hour after the vessel and its six-member crew were temporarily grounded at 
the surf line east of the Newport Beach Pier, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Petty Officer Robert Beals said crew members of the San Pedro-based 
vessel issued a distress signal about 2:30 a.m., expressing fears that the boat 
was running aground. 
</P>
<P>
The crew then lost communication with Coast Guard officers in Long Beach, but a 
Coast Guard helicopter and Orange County Sheriff's Department boat later found 
the Sharkfin caught in the waves close to shore. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Farmer, a Newport Beach marine safety officer, said two of the boat's six 
passengers climbed into a tender -- a small boat -- and attempted to pull the 
Sharkfin out of the sand. But Farmer said a wave capsized the boat, throwing 
the men in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"The wave just picked them up and turned their little boat upside down," Farmer 
said. "They crawled out and walked to shore." 
</P>
<P>
Beals said another fishing boat, the Pamela Rose, later towed the Sharkfin to 
deeper waters. Beals said Coast Guard officials did not know why the vessel ran 
aground.

CITY HIKES TRACTS' PARK REQUIREMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ordinance doubling the amount of parkland required for new housing 
developments was approved this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
By unanimous vote, the council agreed to increase the amount of parkland 
required from 2.5 acres per thousand residents to five acres per thousand. The 
ordinance would also allow developers to pay fees in place of deeding parkland 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the fee money would be used to improve the 694-acre Mission 
Viejo park system.

FAULTY TRANSLATION REVERSES CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana has reversed the conviction of a 
young Vietnamese man who admitted his involvement in a Westminster jewelry 
store robbery on grounds that he had not been properly read his rights because 
of faulty translation. 
</P>
<P>
The court found there was sufficient evidence to prove that Chi Dinh Ta of 
Westminster was one of three men who robbed the Kim Hoang jewelry store on Dec. 
15, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He was identified in a lineup by one of the robbery victims, and was later 
found at the residence where much of the stolen merchandise was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
But the justices found that it was unlikely that Ta understood what was being 
said when the Westminster police read him his rights. 
</P>
<P>
The justices found that the translation was so inadequate that two 
court-appointed interpreters who read the Miranda warning, written by police in 
Vietnamese, could not adequately understand what it said. Ta, the court pointed 
out, has almost no formal education. 
</P>
<P>
"If two well-educated interpreters could not understand critical parts of the 
advisement . . . there is simply too much doubt that a meaningful Miranda 
warning was given in this case," wrote Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr.

FUND TO HELP PAY VICTIM'S MEDICAL BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
A fund was established Tuesday to help pay the medical expenses of a 
44-year-old Seal Beach resident who died Sunday from burns she suffered in a 
fire at her home. 
</P>
<P>
The fund was established by friends, relatives and co-workers of Gay Kenyon, 
who spent eight days in the UCI Medical Center burn unit before dying. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's insurance will cover 80% of the medical bills, leaving her family to 
pay what could amount to thousands of dollars, said her mother, Mary Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon was single and had been living in Seal Beach for a year. She worked as a 
legal assistant at a Century City law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon and her boyfriend, Ralph Royston, were critically burned earlier this 
month when they ran through a wall of flames in an attempt to escape the flames 
that had engulfed a second-story duplex. 
</P>
<P>
Royston remained in critical condition Tuesday, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service for Kenyon is scheduled at 6 p.m. Thursday at the Manhattan 
Beach pier in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Donations to the fund can be mailed to Pam Chase, 920 E. Hatch Road, Suite 10, 
Series, Calif. 95351. SHELBY GRAD

RENOVATION OF SHELTERS NEARS END

Karen and her two teen-age sons have been living in campgrounds, motels and 
shelters for the past year. Now the family lives at the Fullerton New Vista 
Shelter, and Karen says it is a relief to finally have a place to call home for 
a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a shock, after all the years of working, to realize one day you 
don't have a home to go to," said Karen, who now has a job as a nurse's 
assistant. "A lot of times I feel like we're shadow people -- you see a lot of 
us out there in the alleys and pushing shopping carts." 
</P>
<P>
Karen is able to work as a nurse's assistant knowing that she and her two 
teen-age sons will be safe at the cozy two-story house that looks like any 
other home on the block. 
</P>
<P>
And with a $90,000 addition nearly complete, the facility will soon be able to 
offer temporary shelter to eight families, instead of just six. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter is one of five county transitional homes to be renovated or 
expanded as part of a $1-million HomeAid effort launched last summer by the 
Orange County Region of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the association asked each of the five county supervisors to 
choose a shelter to receive HomeAid assistance, said Mike Lennon, spokesman for 
the BIA in Orange County. Then the group went to the directors of each 
temporary home and asked for a list of additions or repairs that could improve 
the shelters, Lennon said. 
</P>
<P>
At the New Vista Shelter, for example, a garage that burned in a fire last year 
is being replaced by a new storage garage that has two rooms on a second floor. 
The addition is expected to be completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
Renovations to the Anchor House in San Clemente and the Interval House were 
completed earlier this year. A complete renovation of the eight-unit complex at 
the Thomas House Temporary Shelter for Families in Garden Grove is expected to 
be finished by June, as is the construction of three three-bedroom duplexes in 
El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers donated time, materials and equipment to the project. When all five 
shelters are operational, the effort will have added 30 beds to the number 
available for the transitional homeless in Orange County, a 15% increase, 
Lennon said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Interval House, which can house up to 26 battered women and children in 
transition, the BIA paid for the renovation of the kitchen, a fresh coat of 
paint inside and out, new carpeting, a new roof, a gated security fence and 
repairs to a back yard storage room, said Mary Walton, executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"'We've always believed in having a nice setting, but it's not always been 
affordable," Walton said. "We felt so fortunate that we were chosen for the 
program." LISA MASCARO

O.C. WOMAN CONVICTED OF HELPING KILL HUSBAND ESCAPES FROM PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
CORRECTIONS: FRONTERA AUTHORITIES HAVE NO IDEA HOW JEANETTE HUGHES GOT OUT 
SUNDAY. SHE HAD BEEN HELD IN 'CLOSE CUSTODY' SINCE A FOILED 1987 ATTEMPT TO SAW 
THE BARS IN HER CELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Authorities at the state women's prison at Frontera remained baffled Tuesday 
about how Jeanette Lynn Hughes, serving a 25-year sentence for the 1984 murder 
of her husband in Huntington Beach, managed to escape. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the only way we're going to find out is to ask her when we 
finally find her," said Associate Warden Ross Dykes. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, 36, disappeared Sunday after visiting with her father, James Tugwell, 
in the large visitors lounge in the late afternoon. She was discovered missing 
about 9:20 p.m. when she had not been escorted back to her housing unit 
following the end of the visitation period at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first escape from the 67-acre, maximum-security prison near Chino in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hughes, like the other inmates, was wearing her own clothes, Dykes 
said there was no evidence to show that she had simply walked out with other 
visitors leaving the prison. In fact, her father was observed leaving, but not 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes said there was also no sign that Hughes had somehow scaled the 12-foot 
fence which surrounds the prison. The fence is topped by sharp ribbon wire. The 
associate warden said no one could cross that wire without leaving evidence 
that it had been disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also ruled out the possibility that she had remained on the prison 
grounds, after they spent all night searching for her. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a person will hide out right here, holed up for days waiting a 
chance to escape," Dykes said. "But about the only thing we are sure of in 
Jeanette Hughes' case is that she is definitely not still on the premises." 
</P>
<P>
They said they also checked all commercial vehicles that had been there on 
business that day to see if she had hidden in one of them. They turned up 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials sent out a statewide alert to law enforcement agencies, and 
began an intensive search for Hughes' father. But he was located Monday at one 
of the addresses he had given to prison officials earlier, and Dykes said 
prison authorities are convinced that he was not involved in his daughter's 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
"We really think he was as surprised about this as we were," Dykes said. 
</P>
<P>
One area Dykes said he could not discuss was what other inmates who lived near 
Hughes might know. He would say only that there was no evidence any other 
inmate had helped her. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes had attempted to escape before. 
</P>
<P>
She and others cut the bars of their cells in 1987. But their plan was 
discovered before anyone made it out of a cell. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hughes has been on "close custody," which includes being escorted 
to and from the visitors area. It also means that she is housed in an area that 
does not have the same access to the yard as most other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes said the prison has not ordered any change in policies since Hughes' 
escape because "we have no idea right now what weaknesses in our security 
system exist." 
</P>
<P>
But Dykes said one change that could occur would be if officials learned 
Hughes' escape was aided in any way by the fact she was in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was convicted in 1986 for the death of her husband, James Hughes, who 
was shot while he slept in their tract home. Hughes later confessed that he was 
killed by her lover, Adam Ramirez, because the two of them wanted the $442,000 
that would go to her from his life insurance. She admitted that she had left a 
light to signal Ramirez when it was safe to come in and then later made up a 
story about a burglar shooting her husband and then hitting her. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, tried separately from Hughes, was convicted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' trial attorney, Donald G. Rubright, said Tuesday that he had not talked 
to his former client for more than a year. About her escape, he said, "She was 
always very resourceful." 
</P>
<P>
Rubright said he was pleased to hear that it appeared that her father was not 
involved in her escape. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a wonderful man who just happens to be totally committed to his 
daughter," Rubright said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' first parole hearing would have been scheduled for 1998. But an escape, 
Rubright said, would probably set back her chances of parole by at least three 
to four years.

4 FACE RUNOFFS IN SEAL BEACH VOTE

<P>
The election to fill two open seats on the City Council ended in a draw 
Tuesday, with two candidates who oppose a massive housing development and two 
who favor it headed for a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Because none of the eight candidates received at least 50% of the vote in 
either of the two council district races, the top two vote-getters in each 
district will appear in a May 8 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
In District 1, which covers the downtown and Surfside neighborhoods, the race 
will pit engineering contractor Joe Rullo against property manager Marilyn 
Bruce Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
In District 3, which covers the Hill neighborhood and part of the Leisure World 
retirement community, Planning Commissioner Gwen Forsythe and environmental 
activist Galen F. Ambrose will face off. 
</P>
<P>
The council seats are being vacated by Joyce Risner and Victor Grgas, two 
members of a council majority that support the Hellman Ranch project proposed 
by the Mola Development Corp. A victory for anti-growth forces in the runoff 
could set up a council majority hostile to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Rullo and Forsythe back the project; Ambrose and Hastings oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 329-home Hellman Ranch project was the main issue in the campaign, 
with the eight candidates evenly divided over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The 149-acre development, which would set aside 41 acres for wetlands 
restoration, was approved by the City Council last October after months of 
often heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the development had hailed the project as being far better than 
the original plan for 773 houses, saying it represented a fair balance between 
commercial and environmental concerns. They insisted that the project would not 
harm Seal Beach, and expressed doubts that the city could keep the owners of 
the land from developing it. 
</P>
<P>
Hellman Ranch foes criticized the plan for not adequately addressing 
environmental concerns. They said they feared that the project would increase 
traffic, pollution and crime, adding that they preferred a plan with fewer 
homes and more wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The Hellman development took on added importance in the campaign earlier this 
month when an Orange County Superior Court commissioner ruled that the city's 
General Plan was outdated and that the Hellman Ranch development must be 
approved for a second time by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Because the General Plan revisions are not final, it is still not known whether 
the council will vote on the measure before May 15, when the two new council 
members will take office. 
</P>
<P>
The election was marked by its lack of rancor and mudslinging in a city known 
for heated politics. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the divisive issue of growth at the forefront, some candidates went 
out of their way not to attack the others directly. 
</P>
<P>
Growth in the city of 26,000 people will be a major issue for the incoming 
council. Two major developments -- one at Bixby Ranch in northern Seal Beach 
and another at a property owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power -- will likely be debated by the council in the next year.

An angry Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth criticized Gov. George 
Deukmejian and state officials Tuesday for forcing county leaders into the 
politically uncomfortable position of having to repeatedly approve an emergency 
declaration in the state's battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frustrated that there has been no correct answer from the state on this 
issue," Roth told other supervisors. "I'm tired of taking these actions every 
two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors are required by state law to renew the declaration of emergency 
every two weeks or lose protection against possible liability claims from the 
aerial spraying of malathion. Board members have been trying to find ways to 
avoid dealing with the controversial issue of whether the pesticide spraying by 
helicopter poses any health or safety risk. Supervisors Roth, Thomas F. Riley 
and Gaddi H. Vasquez have supported renewal of the declaration since last 
November, and Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder have opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 8 letter to Roth, Deukmejian wrote that other jurisdictions faced 
with the same review requirement used a "less formalized process than has 
Orange County." The governor suggested that the supervisors talk with the other 
jurisdictions and find out how they are doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said that other counties were contacted and that "we are doing the same as 
anybody else." He added, "I am disappointed in the governor's letter to us in 
which he did not spell out some other alternative where we would not have to do 
this every two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
"Here we have Sacramento 500 miles away, and we are unable to communicate 
exactly what the problem is. The governor's letter was really a sham, telling 
us, 'Why don't you do like other counties do and you won't have any problems,' 
so it appears to me they don't know what they are doing either." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he was concerned that this illustrated the way state government is 
"being run up and down the State of California." 
</P>
<P>
The state began malathion spraying in parts of Orange County last December 
after pregnant female Medflies were found. But state officials announced last 
week that they expect to end the aerial spraying in the county as of May 3, a 
month early. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Stanton, an outspoken critic of the aerial spraying, summed up why 
the issue is politically controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"No one on this board favors spraying," Stanton said. "There is a little bit of 
confusion when people read the vote on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said "this experience" with the Medfly has shown that there are "some 
problems and inconsistencies with the concept of the declaration of 
emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's the Medfly or something down the road we may not be able to 
foresee right now . . . it's imperative that we engage in a strategy so we can 
resolve this issue," Vasquez said. He added that the board has to face the "now 
famous two-week review" without having "any right of refusal." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, state officials, responding to concerns raised by 
Orange County malathion critics, have decided to take no action on the idea of 
requiring hotels and motels in the spray zones to notify their guests about 
upcoming aerial applications. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) and released 
Tuesday, Isi A. Siddiqui, assistant director of the state Department of Food 
and Agriculture, said the hotels and other businesses are being notified of 
sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, your suggestion that the state supply treatment information to 
these establishments is duly noted, and we are glad to report that it has been 
done all along and will continue to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the response does not address the specific question of requiring the hotels 
to notify their guests, an idea that state officials had previously rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"They totally missed the point," said Garden Grove resident Bob Taylor, an 
anti-malathion organizer who, along with Pringle, had called for the 
notification requirement. "We made clear what we wanted, and they chose just to 
ignore us." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state agriculture officials have rescheduled the malathion spraying 
in North County for this Friday.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
NEW POSITION PUTS NEVIN ON DEFENSIVE, BUT HE REGAINS FOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of February, it appeared that Cal State Fullerton third baseman Phil 
Nevin had become as proficient at kicking as he had been for the Titans' 
football team last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Nine errors in Fullerton's first 15 games had raised speculation that Nevin, 
who made 15 of 21 field goal attempts in 1989, wasn't making the 
football-to-baseball transition as well as he did at El Dorado High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just booting the ball, that's all I can say," Nevin said. 
</P>
<P>
But Nevin's problems really had nothing to do with the change of seasons. 
Rather, it was the move from shortstop, where he played in high school, to 
third base that caused his defensive disorders. 
</P>
<P>
At shortstop, Nevin, a freshman, was able to read hops better. He could sit 
back on grounders, look for the good bounce and rely on his strong arm to throw 
out runners. At third, Nevin has had to deal with bunts, drag bunts, slow 
rollers and hard shots hit directly at him. The hard shots and the short hops 
have been especially baffling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a hockey goalie, just trying to knock the ball down and throw guys 
out," Nevin said. "I figured it would be an easy position to play, but I was 
really wrong there." 
</P>
<P>
With each error came more ribbing from teammates during practice. "You're 
fielding with a skillet," they'd tell Nevin, a third-round draft choice of the 
Dodgers last June. 
</P>
<P>
But for the past month, Nevin has sizzled in the field. . He has made only two 
errors in the past 11 games for the Titans (15-12). 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't work as hard as I should have on my defense this winter, but I'm 
putting the time in now," Nevin said. "I'm finally getting the hang of it. The 
errors were demoralizing at first, because people expected a lot from me and I 
expected a lot from myself too." 
</P>
<P>
Diminishing returns: Through Fullerton's season of inconsistency, one steady 
influence has been outfielder Rich Gonzales, who has reached base safely in all 
27 Titan games. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, who was a standout at Rancho Santiago College, ranks third on the 
team in batting with a .379 average, a marked improvement over last season's 
.281 average. 
</P>
<P>
The senior cleanup hitter has two home runs and 15 runs batted in. He has 
struck out only eight times and walked 12 times. Last season, he had 26 
strikeouts and 11 walks. 
</P>
<P>
Why the beefed-up statistics? 
</P>
<P>
A trimmed-down Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
By closely monitoring his diet, the 6-foot-2 Gonzales lost more than 20 pounds 
during the off-season, dropping from 215 to 192. He says he has improved his 
mobility, foot and bat speed without compromising his power. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think my weight hurt me until I reached this level," Gonzales said. 
"Last year, the long season wore me down. I wasn't mentally or physically ready 
for a four-year school. But I'm in shape this year." 
</P>
<P>
Food for thought: Outfielder David Ayala has posted modest numbers this season 
-- a .290 average with one home run and 10 RBIs -- but around his Fullerton 
apartment, Ayala does extremely well at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore rooms with two of the best cooks on the team, second baseman Mate 
Borgogno and reserve outfielder Matt McElreath. McElreath's specialty is 
Chinese food, and Borgogno loves to prepare everything from Italian food to 
desserts to barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to eat out much," Ayala said. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno makes spaghetti sauce from scratch and fries his own beans for Mexican 
dishes. He enjoys experimenting in the kitchen. Among his favorite authors is 
Betty Crocker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not actually a gourmet cook but I imagine I am," Borgogno said. "I love 
inviting teammates over, putting food on the table and watching them eat. I 
guess I'm a typical Italian." 
</P>
<P>
Ain't seen nothin' yet: Must be something in those Blyleven genes. Like his 
father, Angel pitcher Bert Blyleven, Todd Blyleven already has developed a 
pretty wicked curve, one that Titan Coach Larry Cochell hopes will bolster his 
staff next season. Blyleven, a Villa Park High School standout, made an oral 
commitment this week to sign with Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
But if you think Blyleven's curve is good now, just wait until you see it in a 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad says my curve is better than his when he was this age, and he thinks 
it's going to get better," said Blyleven, whose father possesses what many 
consider the best curve in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Todd says his dad taught him the curve, but it wasn't a pitch he has perfected 
over many years. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't let me throw a curve until I was 15, because he said it was bad 
for my arm," Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
Two-for-one deal: Wondering how Titan football Coach Gene Murphy was able to 
add two assistants to replace the two who recently resigned when one of those 
who departed, Preston Dennard, said his position was phased out because of 
budget cuts? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The salary previously allotted to former secondary coach Ed Donatell, 
who accepted a similar position with the New York Jets, was split between new 
assistants Hue Jackson (offensive backs) and Mike Foster (defensive backs). 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gene Murphy has pushed spring football practice back a week to give Hue Jackson 
and Mike Foster time to adjust to their new positions. Conditioning drills were 
supposed to begin Tuesday but are now set for April 2. An intrasquad scrimmage 
is scheduled for May 5. . . . Titan softball pitcher Ann Van Dortrecht was 
named Big West Conference co-pitcher of the week for her performance in last 
week's PONY Invitational tournament. She was 5-1 with two shutouts and 47 
strikeouts and allowed only three runs in leading Fullerton to the semifinals, 
where the Titans lost to Arizona, 2-0. . . . Fullerton (24-9) dropped from 
first to fourth in this week's NCAA softball poll. UCLA (29-4) took over the 
top spot, followed by Fresno State (28-7) and Arizona (28-7). . . . The Titans' 
softball game against UC Santa Barbara at 5 tonight will be tape delayed and

Jennifer Sullivan, a two-time Sunset League most valuable player, and Aimee 
McDaniel, the Orange League's most valuable player and an All-American, head 
the list of players chosen for the Orange County All-Star girls' basketball 
game April 28 in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, a 6-foot-3 senior who averaged 17.3 points and 14.7 rebounds for 
Ocean View, will try to lead the North to the title for the first time since 
1987. Seven of her 15 teammates on the North squad are from the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jalewalia, La Quinta's 6-1 guard/forward/center, is from the Garden Grove 
League, but she will team with Sullivan to provide the North with some height. 
Jalewalia, who will attend UCLA in the fall, led the Southern Section in 
scoring with 33 points a game and set the county single-game scoring record (60 
points). 
</P>
<P>
Even with Jalewalia, the North team is sorely lacking in height at center and 
forward. The team is loaded with guards. 
</P>
<P>
The South, on the other hand, has plenty of forwards and centers with good 
height. McDaniel, who will play guard, led Brea-Olinda to its second appearance 
in the state 3-A basketball finals and is the school's all-time leading scorer 
with 1,845 points. She will attend Pepperdine in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View's Ollie Martin and assistant Steve Rochford will coach the North. 
Tustin's Rick Falk and his assistant Lisa MacNamee will coach the South, which 
has won the past two seasons and leads the series 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
The team rosters:

MARKET BEAT: INVESTORS CAST WATCHFUL EYE ON INITIAL PINKERTON OFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Securities and Exchange Commission had more of a sense of humor, 
Pinkerton's Inc. could be advertising its upcoming initial stock offering using 
photos of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It was Pinkerton's private 
security agents who tracked down the infamous pair in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Pinkerton's, the SEC frowns on that kind of self-promotion. 
Even so, the fabled Van Nuys-based company's stock offering, expected in April, 
is attracting plenty of attention, local brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
Pinkerton's plans to sell 1.333 million shares to the public at $14 to $16 
each. Because of the firm's colorful history, many investors are taking notice. 
But just how well the stock will perform after the offering -- and long term -- 
is a big question mark. Pinkerton's, whose business today primarily is security 
guard services, is a company in transition. Heavily in debt, its success will 
depend in part on that most chancy of elements: a good marketing plan to raise 
the value of the franchise in customers' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, security should be a growth field in the '90s. David Marzo, an 
analyst with Rosenkrantz, Lyon &amp; Ross in New York, believes that a tougher 
economy in the next few years will raise the risk of crime and increase demand 
for home and business protection. Local police budget cutbacks and a rising 
tide of criminals let loose for lack of prison space also should boost demand 
for protection, Marzo said. 
</P>
<P>
For Pinkerton's, which derives 98% of its revenue from guard services, that 
should mean healthy growth. The question is whether Pinkerton's can make good 
money off that growth. Chasing Butch and Sundance was glamorous, but the 
security business today is a highly competitive one that anyone can enter. And 
that means low profit margins: about 1% on sales. 
</P>
<P>
Pinkerton's CEO, Thomas Wathen, knew all about that when he bought Pinkerton's 
from American Brands in January, 1988. Wathen founded California Plant 
Protection in 1947 and grew it into a major player in the security field. (CPP 
provided security for the '84 Olympics.) When rival Pinkerton's was put up for 
sale, Wathen saw a chance to grab and revitalize the best-known security name 
of all. 
</P>
<P>
With the merger, the combined firm took the Pinkerton's name and the famous 
"watchful eye" symbol. Then Wathen went to work on the giant he'd created, 
slashing costs. The result: Pinkerton's gross profit jumped 20% last year even 
as revenue fell 7%. The firm's net profit last year was $1.16 a share, versus a 
loss of 24 cents in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The cut in revenue says a lot about the low margins in the business: Wathen 
jettisoned many contracts that simply weren't worth Pinkerton's while. Just 
last December, the New York Racing Assn. ended its 100-year-old contract with 
Pinkerton's after Wathen asked for a 1% price hike for security at Belmont, 
Aqueduct and Saratoga race tracks. Archrival Wackenhut got the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the challenge for Wathen in the '90s: Can he attract a sufficient 
number of new clients who will pay a decent rate for Pinkerton's protection in 
a very competitive field? Also, can he expand in the private investigations 
field, a tiny part of Pinkerton's now but an area of high profit potential? 
</P>
<P>
Because of SEC rules, neither Wathen nor his investment bankers (Smith Barney, 
Harris Upham &amp; Co.) can say much beyond what's in the stock offering 
prospectus. But Marzo is a believer in Wathen. He notes that one of Wathen's 
goals is to capitalize on Pinkerton's name. "It's the greatest name in the 
business, and it hasn't been marketed," Marzo argues, despite Pinkerton's 
impressive size: 208 offices in 40 states, 40,000 employees and contracts with 
275 of the Fortune 500. 
</P>
<P>
Marzo sees Pinkerton's successfully pitching itself as one of the few 
high-quality firms in a business that has a lousy reputation. "The level of 
security guard service in general is appalling," Marzo said. "It can only go 
up." 
</P>
<P>
While Wathen, 60, wins kudos for his business savvy, the financial aspects of 
Pinkerton's offering trouble some investors: 
</P>
<P>
* About 85% of the cash from the stock offering will be used to reduce debt 
incurred in the 1988 merger. But Pinkerton's will remain highly leveraged and 
"will have very little financial or operational flexibility," it warns in its 
prospectus. However, the company would be helped by a refinancing of $60 
million of its long-term debt, via the sale of notes to two major insurance 
companies. (Pinkerton's doesn't name them but said it has a preliminary 
commitment from them.) 
</P>
<P>
* After the offering, Pinkerton's will have a negative tangible net worth of 
$2.01 a share. That is largely because of accounting rules for the $65-million 
premium that Wathen paid for Pinkerton's above the value of its real assets. 
Still, Richard Carney of Cramblit &amp; Carney in Los Angeles, a $900 
million-asset money manager, would rather see stronger finances. "I think it's 
too early to be bringing this company public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Wathen, who is selling 666,667 shares in the offering, will use about 
half of his proceeds to repay debt to Pinkerton's. Even with his stock sale, 
Wathen will control about 60% of Pinkerton's stock after the offering. So for 
all practical purposes, he alone will control the company's destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Wathen's fans say he's a worthy successor to Allan Pinkerton, the 
legendary Scotsman who founded Pinkerton's in Chicago in 1850 and whose motto 
was "We Never Sleep." If Wathen is going to produce the earnings growth that 
will make Pinkerton's stock a star in the 1990s, he may have to give up more 
than a little sleep himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRIVATE EYE GOES PUBLIC 
</P>
<P>
Pinkerton's Inc., the Van Nuys-based security firm, plans to sell stock to the 
public next month. The company mushroomed in size with a 1988 merger, and a 
cost-cutting plan helped boost profits last year. But heavy debt leaves big 
questions about long-term earnings growth.

Briefly: Tokos Medical Corp. of Santa Ana went public at $12 a share Monday and 
closed at $11.75 that day. The firm, which provides home services for detection 
and treatment of early labor in pregnancy, sold 2 million shares. Tokos CEO 
Robert Byrnes said the stock was depressed Monday by additional stock sales by 
company founders, which he said had been expected. But Tuesday, the stock 
remained below the offering price, closing at $11.875. . . . Coming soon, yet 
another way to bet on a further plunge in Japanese stocks: The Pacific Stock 
Exchange has filed with the SEC to trade "put" warrants on Japan's Nikkei stock 
average. . . . Cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc. will hold a meeting with 
analysts Thursday in Denver. Wall Street is eager to hear if TCI Chief John 
Malone has any antidote for depressed cable stocks.

Big Moves: Toastmasters International is relocating its world headquarters from 
Santa Ana south to Rancho Santa Margarita, where the leadership training 
organization bought 3.5 acres and is constructing a 47,000-square-foot office 
building. Also, Pyramid Optical Corp., a unit of Japan's largest maker of 
surveying equipment, bought a building with 39,000 square feet in Garden 
Grove's Euclid Business Center for $2.5 million. Pyramid is moving from two 
buildings in Irvine.

O.C. HOUSING MARKET 4TH LEAST AFFORDABLE IN U.S., STUDY SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: A NATIONWIDE SURVEY INDICATES THAT IN ORANGE COUNTY, IT TAKES 51% 
OF A HOUSEHOLD'S MEDIAN INCOME TO MEET THE AVERAGE MORTGAGE PAYMENT. IN SAN 
FRANCISCO, IT TAKES 54%.

<P>
Orange County was the fourth least-affordable housing market in the nation late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
That estimate is based on a study by the Prudential Real Estate Affiliates 
Inc., a chain of real estate brokerages based in Costa Mesa, and Wharton 
Econometrics Forecasting Associates. The study contrasted median household 
income with average monthly mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that it took 51.5% of a household's median income to make the 
average monthly mortgage payment in Orange County, which has some of the 
highest prices for single-family homes in the nation. (In February, it was 
$243,285, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.) 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, a buyer can't even qualify for a mortgage if the payment takes 
more than 28% of his or her monthly income. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nation's 150-largest housing markets, homeowners in 97 markets could buy 
a home for less than 28% of their monthly income. 
</P>
<P>
The Northeast and the West continue to be the least-affordable markets. San 
Francisco led all markets with an average monthly mortgage payment that 
required 54.1% of a household's median income. 
</P>
<P>
The New Bedford-Fall River, Mass., area was second with 53.5%; Honolulu third 
with 52.5%; Santa Rosa fifth with 50%; and San Diego sixth with 46.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Peoria, Ill., was the most affordable market in the nation. An average mortgage 
required only 8.8% of a household's income. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the California markets, including Orange County, have booming economies 
and rising incomes, which mean a lot of competition for housing and the 
resulting high prices. Even a slowdown in home sales hasn't brought down prices 
much. 
</P>
<P>
But New Bedford-Fall River, of all the markets at the top of the list, has a 
much different and less enviable problem: It has relatively high home prices 
and low household incomes, about $31,000 at last count. By contrast, it's 
nearly $54,000 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
New Bedford started out as a whaling port in the Colonial days of the 17th 
Century. Fall River, 12 miles inland, is a product of the 19th-Century's 
Industrial Revolution. Both have long been in decline. New Bedford was hurt by 
the falling fortunes of New England's fishing industry. Fall River was 
abandoned by many of the textile mills at the turn of the century, which moved 
to the South in search of cheaper labor. 
</P>
<P>
The area's unemployment, usually around 7%, just hit a seasonal high of 11%, 
highest in Massachusetts. Thousands of poor immigrants -- traditionally, many 
are Portuguese -- work in low-wage garment shops or on construction crews. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even these blue-collar industrial towns weren't immune to the increase 
in home prices as New England's economy boomed in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"There were very high expectations for growth in the high-tech industries, in 
defense industries and in services," said Steve Cochran, an economist with the 
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "Incomes were growing and people 
were willing to bid up home prices. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that computers and defense are hurting now, and only the 
service industries are still growing." 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't brought home prices down much, even in Fall River. Prices are 
lower here than in Boston -- and they took quite a tumble last year -- but 
they're still high enough to startle most people in Peoria. The average 
single-family house, according to the local multiple listings, costs $138,747. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't forced to sell, so they're sticking to their price and holding 
on to their houses," said Louis Andrade, a Century 21 broker in Fall River. "It 
means prices haven't come down all that much." 
</P>
<P>
Both towns have brought in some new factories by pitching their land costs, 
wages and rents, all of which are lower than much of the rest of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new factories with their better wages, "it still usually takes two 
paychecks to put a deal for a house together," said Edward Lavoie, another 
Century 21 broker in Fall River. "This is a real blue-collar area, and incomes 
aren't anywhere near what they are in Boston." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Fall River and New Bedford residents can take comfort in the fact that 
home prices are still lower than much of the rest of New England and far lower 
than in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we're nowhere near San Francisco or that other really expensive area you 
have out there," said Lavoie, "Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY 
</P>
<P>
Here are the most and least affordable of the top 150 U.S. markets. 
Affordability rankings are based on the percentage of an average family's gross 
monthly income needed to make payments on an average-priced house in the area 
after a 20% down payment.

Fluor Daniel said Tuesday that it has been awarded three contracts involving 
separate construction and energy engineering projects for two foreign companies 
and the government of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the principal operating subsidiary of Irvine-based Fluor Corp., 
said it has won contracts to study the possible expansion of a natural gas 
pipeline in Thailand; to supervise construction of a $94-million petrochemical 
plant in England for Royal Dutch Shell Co. of the Netherlands; and to build an 
800,000-square-foot addition to a Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. automobile 
factory in Smyrna, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Total value of the contracts was not disclosed. But the company said the awards 
added to its contract backlog, which totaled $8.7 billion as of the first 
quarter ended Jan. 31, up 25% from the same period in the previous year.

3D PICNIC USES INTELLIGENCE, WIT, VARIETY TO HELP SELL DEBUT ALBUM IN A 2D 
WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
POP: THE GROUP, WHICH PLAYS TONIGHT AT THE MARQUEE IN WESTMINSTER, HAS FINALLY 
FOUND AN OBSCURE SAN DIEGO RECORD LABEL FOR ITS ECLECTIC APPROACH.

<P>
3D Picnic went out and made a debut album that lays out an exceptionally 
diverse spread of styles and emotional tones, and pulls off each of them 
exceedingly well. 
</P>
<P>
Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that is, in the eyes of too much of today's music industry, which 
seems to have forgotten how to think in two dimensions, let alone three. The 
trick to making it in music nowadays is to fit into one of the ready-made 
marketing pipelines that record companies and radio use to reach specialized 
segments of a public presumed to be too narrow and fragmented to accept much 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
That made it hard for 3D Picnic -- which plays tonight at Club Tangent at the 
Marquee in Westminster -- to find a home for its self-financed album, "Dirt." 
The album's 14 songs (18 on compact disc) range from sumptuous Beatlesque pop 
to mournful, folk-tinged balladry, with blitzing New Wave and David Bowie-style 
rockers and novelty numbers such as a hillbilly joke song, "Dirty Feet," thrown 
in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
Given today's stratified thinking, 3D Picnic's album is far too pop for 
alternative and college markets, far too offbeat for Top 40 or mainstream rock 
markets and far too diverse for just about everybody who thinks in terms of 
markets rather than music. 
</P>
<P>
After repeated rejections by large labels and small, the Los Angeles band, 
which has close ties to the Orange County rock scene, found an obscure San 
Diego label and distributor, Earth Music/Cargo Records, that dug "Dirt." The 
album, completed a year ago, was finally released last week. 
</P>
<P>
Over dinner recently at a restaurant in Sunset Beach, band members Don Burnet, 
Carolynne Edwards and Mickey Ferrel were more bemused than bitter about the 
problems they had in persuading a record company to take a chance on their 
album. 
</P>
<P>
"From a marketing standpoint, it's been difficult," said Burnet, the band's 
main singer and songwriter, whose long, rounded face and fisherman's cap make 
him look a little like a young John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing the next big thing," he said. "If the Beatles were around 
now and doing the 'White Album,' they'd probably get dropped by their label." 
</P>
<P>
Burnet -- dubbed "Dallas Don" in the album credits -- has been a part of the 
local rock scene since 1981, when he and his girlfriend piled into a van in 
Chicago, headed west for their spring vacation and never went back. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been a straight-A goodie-goodie, and all of a sudden I did an 
about-face," Burnet said of his decision to quit high school at 17 and settle 
in Huntington Beach, where he had friends. "I had been really shy and 
introverted, and I suddenly found all this stuff I liked." 
</P>
<P>
High on Burnet's list of things to like was punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
"In Illinois I'd been into it, but there hadn't been any scene there. Two weeks 
after I got (to Huntington Beach), I saw the Crowd (the first of the Orange 
County punk bands) at a party. I said, 'This is great,' and I got into the 
scene and into a band. I got my amp shipped out from Illinois." 
</P>
<P>
Burnet's first band, Mox Nix, was "total hard core" in approach. But by 1983, 
he was incorporating his more melodic rock roots (he cites the Beatles, Neil 
Young, Blondie and the Ramones as key influences) in a punk band called Plain 
Wrap. The trio released an album for Enigma Records in 1985, but Burnet decided 
to break up the band after bassist Bob Gnarly left, complaining that Plain 
Wrap's direction was becoming too pop-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob would say, 'I just can't get into singin' this "She's Over Me" song (a 
fetching pop-harmony number that appears on "Dirt") with all these skinheads 
standing there." 
</P>
<P>
While Burnet was figuring out what to do after Plain Wrap, Edwards, who grew up 
near Glendale, was becoming dissatisfied with her role as keyboard player in an 
all-woman band patterned after the Bangles. She placed a musican-seeks-band ad 
that cited the Beatles, R.E.M. and Cheap Trick as her influences. Burnet 
responded by sending her a homemade tape of his songs. They got together as a 
duo in 1987 and launched 3D Picnic. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was, a punk from Huntington Beach, and she was a New Wave girl from the 
Valley," Burnet said. 
</P>
<P>
Burnet and Edwards kept 3D Picnic going through many lineup changes and a 
far-from-clamorous reception as it played the club circuit in Hollywood, Long 
Beach and Orange County (band members say their peak draw nowadays ranges from 
100 to 150 fans). The current lineup features Burnet, 26, on guitar, Edwards, 
24, on guitar and keyboards, Ferrel, 27, who joined about a year ago, on bass, 
and drummer Mike Sessa, 24, who joined six months ago and splits time between 
3D Picnic and the Hollywood Joneses. 
</P>
<P>
3D Picnic also had to persevere through a less-than-enthusiastic reception for 
the tapes it made in hope of landing a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
"They were offering suggestions like, what if you and the girl sang every song 
together, or why don't you sing all the songs, or why doesn't she?" Burnet 
said. "There'd be times we'd be thinking, 'Man, maybe we really should change 
this.' " 
</P>
<P>
"We briefly thought about it," said Edwards, a slender woman with delicate 
features and dyed blond hair. "But it's just kind of false if you say, 'We're 
only going to do our fast songs, or our slow countryish songs.' " 
</P>
<P>
The lack of interest from the music industry did take some toll of band morale. 
</P>
<P>
"It got really frustrating at times," Edwards said. "But you'd think, 'We've 
come this far, it'd be stupid to give it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Burnet said he though of disbanding 3D Picnic "a few times. But when we started 
the band I vowed not to do what I'd done with Plain Wrap, which was give it up 
after too short a time." 
</P>
<P>
Sticking with a varied approach, 3D Picnic recorded "Dirt" in studios in Orange 
and Costa Mesa. The production cost of $6,000, according to Burnet, was low for 
an album with a rich, full sound, incorporating many harmonies and instrumental 
layers that required lots of overdubbing. Burnet said 3D Picnic economized by 
thoroughly planning out and rehearsing all the song arrangements in advance so 
no time would be wasted in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything was planned, though. Riding to a gig at Bogart's one night, 
Burnet and Edwards began harmonizing into a tiny Walkman cassette recorder, 
singing "Dirty Feet," an oldie from the country music-comedy team of Homer and 
Jethro. The song, complete with ambient road noise that sounds like waves on a 
beach, wound up as the joke finale on the album. 
</P>
<P>
It's a countrified bookend to such other lighthearted numbers as "Party 
Planet," with its hangover-in-outer-space sound effects, and "The Last One," a 
wry look at bad habits that are too much fun to give up. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the emotional spectrum, such numbers as Burnet's "These 
Thick Walls" and Edwards' "Seven Days of Mourning" make light-footed use of 
language to probe heavy states of depression. Such numbers as "Charles Thinks 
About It" and "Forget the Words" round out the album with catchy philosophizing 
about how to cope with a world that's wound too tightly. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, Burnet said, 3D Picnic takes a leaner, harder approach: "Live, we're 
more raw and faster. I think the live situation and the studio situation should 
be treated differently." 
</P>
<P>
"Dirt" is starting to earn some good reviews, and the members of 3D Picnic 
expect to go on their first national tour this summer. Conscious that the band 
isn't selling "the next big thing," the members are keeping their expectations 
low key. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely looking to move up. We're not into the idea of being a 
college-radio, alternative band all our lives," Burnet said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the main motivation is still pleasing himself: "I'm doing the same 
thing I've been doing ever since I was in a hard-core punk band, which is doing 
the music I like to do." 
</P>
<P>
3D Picnic, Lost Dog and Johnny Monster &amp; the Nightmares play tonight at 
9:30 at Club Tangent at the Marquee, 7000 Garden Grove Blvd., Westminster. 
Information: (714) 891-1971.

THEATER GROUP TO SEARCH FOR NEW LOCATION

<P>
LP Repertory Theatre came up well short of its fund-raising goal last weekend 
and will close its storefront dinner theater in Tustin and search for a new 
location. 
</P>
<P>
The company hoped to stave off eviction by staging four benefit performances by 
Company B, a local variety troupe, said Trisha Andreatta, the company's office 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
But the shows netted just $800 -- considerably under its goal of $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
The group, about $80,000 behind in rent, has been notified that it will be 
evicted at the end of this month but has asked for a month's extension to give 
it time to move its sets and equipment into storage. Performances of its 
current production, "El Grande de Coca Cola," will continue on a week-to-week 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're all going to take a breath and close this place down," 
Andreatta said Tuesday, adding that the Lilliput Players, an adjunct company 
that offers touring children's theater productions, will not be affected by the 
dinner theater's closure. 
</P>
<P>
Fractured Mirror, an improvisational comedy group that has performed at LP 
Repertory, is searching for a new venue, company officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
LP Repertory opened its theater late in 1988 and suffered financial problems 
from the start, including a lack of funds for advertising. The company plans to 
look for a new location in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We will learn from our mistakes, that's for sure," Andreatta said. For one 
thing, she said, "we'll make sure we have a lot more capital before we ever 
open again." 
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said the company is discussing a cooperative venture with other local 
theater groups, including Company B, the Orange County Black Actors Theatre, 
and Stop-Gap, a Santa Ana-based drama therapy group.

BEETHOVENHALLE ORCHESTRA: WHAT'S IN A NAME, ANYWAY?;

THE BONN-BASED GROUP WILL PLAY BEETHOVEN, YES, BUT THE NAME HAS MORE TO DO WITH

<P>
This is a lesson in humility. When news came that the Orchester der 
Beethovenhalle Bonn was going to play Friday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa, some of us got quite excited. 
</P>
<P>
To neophyte ears -- these neophyte ears -- the name suggested a special 
relationship to Beethoven, the heaven-storming master of classical music. 
</P>
<P>
Reality turned out to be a bit drier. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beethoven Halle is the concert hall in Bonn," said music direct or Dennis 
Russell Davies in a recent phone interview from Kalamazoo, Mich., where the 
orchestra is playing on its current 18-city tour. (Other stops include Torrance 
on Saturday and Pasadena on Monday. Friday's concert is sponsored by the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society.) 
</P>
<P>
"This is the orchestra of the city (of Bonn)," Davies said. "The orchestra 
plays in that hall. That's the traditional way in Europe. You've got the 
Concertgebouw Hall in Amsterdam and the Gewandhaus in Leipzig . . . and the 
orchestras that play in those halls take those names." 
</P>
<P>
Oh dear. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the orchestra was formed in 1897 -- long after the master's death in 
1827 -- as the Koblenz Philharmonic. It was adopted by the city of Bonn in 1907 
and since 1963 has carried its present name. 
</P>
<P>
With all due apologies to the good citizens of both cities, it's hard to 
imagine getting very fired up about a group called the Koblenz or the Bonn 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Germany has been very good to Davies. He has fashioned an international 
career from positions in Stuttgart and Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Toledo, Ohio, Davies studied at the Juilliard School, where he and 
Luciano Berio founded the Juilliard Ensemble in 1968. His first major post was 
that of music director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, from 1972-80. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he became general music director of the Stuttgart State Opera for 
seven years. Since 1988, he has been artistic director and chief conductor of 
the city of Bonn, West Germany. As such, he is responsible for 12 concert 
programs each season and two operatic productions. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has a very large music budget for a symphony orchestra, opera house 
and chamber music," he said. "There are other music activities, but these are 
sponsored by the city. I'm in charge of that music that the city sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
One thing he is not in charge of is fund raising for these activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sort of exempt from fund raising: It's not permitted. In Germany, I'm 
employed by the City Council. My boss is the city manager. There is no private 
funding. . . . If I want to tour, I lobby the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
The close connection to government funding doesn't affect programming 
decisions, however. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no hint of any kind of artistic interference. I never had that 
in the States either," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Davies finds only one crucial difference between his American and European 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I never did find much difference in the audiences, to tell the truth, except 
that American audiences are generally older than the European audiences," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Is that a result of a lack of music education programs in our schools? 
</P>
<P>
"That may have something to do with it," Davies said. "Prices may have 
something to do with it. Peer pressure may have something to do with it. . . . 
Also, those of us making symphonic programs and policy have to think about our 
program content to get a wider mix of audiences in the concerts in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with the way you package the activity: What happens at the concert? 
What is the content of the music? How is it presented? What does the event look 
like? If you take a particular age group, would you like to be at a concert if 
you were in that group? 
</P>
<P>
"The problem sometimes is that normal subscription series symphony orchestra 
concerts get to be regular and predictable -- from the repertory, to how it's 
laid out, to how the evening runs, the way everybody looks, what they do before 
and afterwards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If you like that regularity, that predictability -- and some people do -- 
that's fine. But if you don't, one solution is to try to structure a series of 
concerts that give people different experiences. In Europe, there has been a 
concerted effort to do something like that over a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Davies has been known to Californians for leading the Cabrillo Music Festival 
in Santa Cruz County since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of four co-founders of the Manhattan-based American Composers 
Orchestra in 1975 and has been the group's principal conductor. He was 
principal conductor and classical music program director of the Saratoga 
Performing Arts Center in Upstate New York (the summer home of the Philadelphia 
Orchestra) from 1985-88. 
</P>
<P>
The East Coast now will see him on an even more regular basis, however. In 
December, he was named music director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and 
principal conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, starting in 1991. His 
contract lasts until 1994 and stipulates a minimum of six weeks' presence in 
Brooklyn each season. 
</P>
<P>
While known for his promotion of living composers and as a specialist in new 
music -- he premiered Philip Glass's opera "Akhnaten" in Stuttgart in 1984 -- 
the concert in Costa Mesa will include nothing avant-garde. The program 
includes works by Beethoven, Schumann and Prokofiev, linked, if by anything, by 
the fact that they are not those composers' warhorses. 
</P>
<P>
"Beethoven's 'King Stephen' Overture is one of those works that have not been 
played to death," the conductor said. 
</P>
<P>
Prokofiev's Sixth Symphony, also on the program, "is a strong and powerful work 
. . . that is so little known and so little played." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been devoted to this piece for so many years," he added. "Every time I 
play it, it is a premiere. It's a wonderful vehicle for this orchestra. It's 
extremely difficult, it takes a lot of rehearsal time, and it is not 
tremendously accessible on a first hearing. But it's been a success in every 
city I've played it in." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Russell Davies will conduct the Orchester der Beethovenhalle Bonn in 
music by Beethoven, Schumann and Prokofiev at 8 p.m. on Friday at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. The 
concert is sponsored by the Philharmonic Society. Tickets: $12 to $35. 
Information: (714) 646-6277.

<P>
ADIEU MUSICALS? Opera Pacific may be abandoning summer musicals for the future, 
general director David DiChiera said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will do a major musical (in 1991) as we have in the summer 
for the past two years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation with musicals in Southern California is that there seems 
to be a great number of them already available to the community, between the 
Center and the major national touring companies, both in Orange County and Los 
Angeles. We don't want to glut the market." 
</P>
<P>
As to the three operas that the company will present at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in the 1991 season, the productions that were announced 
Monday were originally created for the Washington (D.C.) Opera and the Ft. 
Worth Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Madama Butterfly" was designed for Washington Opera; sets were designed by 
Ming Cho Lee in 1977 and costumes by Zack Brown in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Sets by Johniene Papandreas and costumes by Marjorie McCown for Bizet's "Les 
Pecheurs des Perles" were designed for the Ft. Worth Opera in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The sets and costumes for "Un Ballo in Maschera" were designed by Zack Brown in 
1980 for the Washington Opera.

Groups and individuals that use threats and coercion to violate people's 
constitutional rights would be "hit in the wallet, where it really hurts" by a 
bill overwhelmingly approved by the Assembly. Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd 
(D-Carson) offered the legislation as a means of curbing acts of violence and 
intimidation by groups like the Ku Klux Klan. Under current law, a court can 
grant an injunction against future violations of constitutional rights, but it 
cannot award damages to individuals involved.

A Valencia man escaped his kidnaper by hurling himself from his moving car 
while clad only in his underwear. 
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old man, whose name was not released, was forced into his own car 
at gunpoint in front of the Newhall Post Office Tuesday afternoon by a man 
wearing a turban, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Dean Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim told deputies that the suspect took his wallet containing $20, fired 
four shots into the floor of the car near his feet, ordered him to strip to his 
underwear and hit him on the head with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong ordeal ended when the victim opened his car door and hurled 
himself onto the street at the intersection of Rinaldi Street and Sepulveda 
Boulevard in Mission Hills. He was treated at Holy Cross Hospital for cuts on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect fled in the car and was being sought today. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it was a desperate bid for freedom" by the kidnap victim, Scoville 
said. "The car wasn't stopped."

RANCHO INMATE DIES AFTER FIGHT

<P>
A 22-year-old inmate at the Peter Pitchess Honor Rancho in Saugus died early 
this morning, hours after he was involved in a fight in a maximum-security 
dormitory, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the Sylmar man, who was awaiting trial on auto theft charges, 
was not released because his family had not yet been notified, a sheriff's 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The inmate was found unconscious on the floor of a 150-bed dormitory at about 
6:30 p.m. Tuesday by prison officers responding to an emergency medical call. 
Officials believe he was involved in fight with other inmates. He was taken to 
Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in Santa Clarita, where he died about 3 a.m., 
sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials would not describe the nature of the man's injuries or provide 
details about the fight. Homicide deputies are questioning other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unknown how many individuals were involved in the altercation or whether 
the inmate died as a direct result of it," Ducoulombier said. An autopsy will 
be performed.

'TRIGGERS' BOUND FOR IRAQ; 5 SEIZED AFTER U.S.-BRITISH PROBE;

INDICTMENT COMES FROM SAN DIEGO

<P>
Customs officials said they foiled an attempt today to smuggle 40 U.S.-made 
nuclear trigger components to Iraq via London. 
</P>
<P>
They said five people were arrested, including an Iraqi who was picked up at 
Heathrow Airport and is being expelled from Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the devices arrived 
from the United States two days earlier and were kept under surveillance until 
the alleged smugglers attempted to put them on a scheduled Iraqi Airways flight 
to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a U.S. Customs Service spokesman, Ed Kittredge, said the arrests 
resulted from an 18-month investigation by U.S. and British customs officials. 
A sealed indictment has been returned in the case in U.S. District Court in San 
Diego, he said. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "This issue raises once again our 
concern for the nuclear proliferation in the Middle East." He called on nuclear 
suppliers "to exercise special restraint in providing materials to this region 
of the world, and we continue to urge that all states adhere to the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty," including Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The incident could further strain relations between Britain and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Britain recalled its ambassador from Baghdad after the 
Iraqis hanged an Iranian-born journalist working for a British newspaper. Iraq 
accused the journalist, Farzad Bazoft, of spying. 
</P>
<P>
BBC-TV said customs officials, tipped off by their American counterparts, 
removed the nuclear devices and substituted harmless replacements, then waited 
for the packages to be collected from their freight shed. 
</P>
<P>
It showed footage of the operation which it said was shot by an NBC crew that 
had been following the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said the detainees also included three Britons and a Lebanese. 
It said the Iraqi was being deported because of attempted breaches of British 
laws restricting the export of high technology. 
</P>
<P>
The customs officials said the items were capacitors, electrical devices that 
form part of the detonation chain of a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Paul Wilkinson, a Bradford University terrorism expert, said of Iraq: "If 
they're trying to smuggle in these highly sophisticated trigger devices, that 
means they're very serious about making nuclear weapons and soon." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Banks, a Middle East expert at the respected Jane's Defense Weekly, said 
nuclear triggers are devices for initiating an explosion in a nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very, very high technology. There are only a very few countries in 
the world capable of manufacturing this type of technology, and there is no 
other use for a nuclear triggering device than to trigger a nuclear weapon," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether Iraq has nuclear weapons capability, but it has been 
developing a long-range missile judged by some military analysts to be capable 
of delivering a nuclear warhead.

Bookmakers have stopped taking bets on whether Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
will win the next election because most gamblers believe that it is inevitable 
she will be ousted as leader of the Conservative Party, experts said today. 
</P>
<P>
Leading bookmakers said the street barometer of Thatcher's sliding political 
fortunes showed that she was bad for business and so the account had been 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ending up with a totally one-sided book and that is not good 
business," said Graham Sharpe of William Hill. "All we were doing was leaving 
ourselves open to a large liability." 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show Thatcher is lagging by a range of 19 to 28 points behind the 
opposition Labor Party in dissatisfaction attributed to high interest rates, a 
new tax scheme and repugnance of her leadership style, which critics call 
autocratic and geared to the rich.

Thousands of rival blacks fought running battles in strife-torn Natal province 
today, setting scores of houses ablaze and leaving at least eight people dead 
and 60 wounded in two days, witnesses and hospital sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities deployed police supported by army troops in an effort to halt the 
fighting between supporters of the African National Congress-linked United 
Democratic Front and the rival Inkatha tribal movement of moderate black leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
"It almost looks as though the whole area is burning," Pietermaritzburg police 
spokesman Maj. Piet Kitching said. The fighting covered a 120-square-mile area 
encompassing several townships, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
White opposition Democratic Party Regional Director Radley Keys toured the area 
by helicopter, estimating that there were as many as 20,000 blacks roaming the 
streets in mobs of 100.

Thousands of Czechoslovaks who emigrated after the crushing of the Prague

Parliament, amending current laws, ruled today that Czechoslovak nationality

Parliament, in a package of civil rights measures being rushed through, also

A state appeals court may uphold a murderer's death sentence even if the 
sentencing jury wrongly considered some adverse evidence, a deeply divided 
Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that state appeals courts are empowered to 
reweigh aggravating and mitigating evidence in capital punishment cases without 
sending them back for new jury determinations. 
</P>
<P>
But the court stopped short of upholding the death sentence of Chandler 
Clemons. 
</P>
<P>
Clemons was convicted of killing a delivery man after robbing him of $5 in cash 
and a few pizzas in Vicksburg, Miss., three years ago. One of the aggravating 
factors his sentencing jury considered before imposing a death sentence was the 
"especially heinous, atrocious or cruel" nature of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The Mississippi Supreme Court found that such an aggravating factor is 
unconstitutionally vague. But rather than throw out Clemons' sentence, the 
state high court ruled that the sentence would have been the same even if the 
impermissible factor had not been considered.

Government ministers today for the first time faced a public parliamentary 
grilling on topics ranging from chronic food shortages to a foiled scheme to 
sell tanks abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of the ministers before the Supreme Soviet marked another step 
toward making appointed officials subordinate to the elected legislature, as 
envisaged in the perestroika program of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, ministers had faced organized questioning only once, at their 
confirmation hearings last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the heat fell on economic ministers who were asked to explain why an 
economic revival plan adopted three months ago has failed to produce tangible 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Vladilen Nikitin, first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, said the 
growth in the rate of food production shrank more than 50% between 1988 and 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Moving up the introduction of regulated market relations is the only way out 
of a very difficult situation," Tass quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Igor Byelousov, chief of the Soviet military-industrial complex, was grilled 
about a scheme to illegally export a dozen Soviet tanks to the West. The plan 
was uncovered and foiled by the military. Tass said deputies wanted to know the 
responsibility of "those in high places who authorized it."

General Electric Co. gained a foothold in the lucrative East European airline 
market today in announcing an agreement to supply aircraft engines to Soviet 
Union's Aeroflot, the world's biggest airline. 
</P>
<P>
The government-owned airline placed five firm orders and five options for jet 
engines valued at about $150 million to power Airbus Industrie A310-300 
aircraft, GE announced. 
</P>
<P>
The CF6-80C2 GE engines, and the planes, will be the first made in the West to 
be incorporated in Aeroflot's fleet of more than 3,000 planes. 
</P>
<P>
The award followed fierce competition with another Connecticut-based engine 
manufacturer, Pratt &amp; Whitney of East Hartford.

<P>
Both companies were host to a delegation of Soviet aviation experts who visited

The stock market was mixed today in a meandering trading session as traders 
studied a slightly stronger-than-expected reading on the state of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.75 to 2,743.69. 
</P>
<P>
But declining issues slightly outpaced advances on the New York Stock Exchange, 
with 700 up, 720 down and 552 unchanged.. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 142.30 million shares, against 131.61 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained .37 to 187.77. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors stood on the sidelines, unconvinced that Tuesday's big 29.28 
point gain in the Dow index marked the beginning of any solid upward market 
move. A loss in Tokyo stocks also pressured blue chip stocks in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at a 1.1% annual 
rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The figure was revised upward from a previous estimate of 0.9%, and came in 
above most analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers viewed it as a modest new indication that the pace of business 
activity seemed to be picking up slowly, reducing the chances of any 
full-fledged recession. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, traders also appeared to conclude that the odds were 
shifting in favor of higher interest rates in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were lower in quiet trading early today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 3/8 point, or $3.75 for 
every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield, which rises when the 
price falls, jumped to 8.50% from 8.46% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that bond prices declined despite a government report today on 
the gross national product indicating slow economic growth, which is usually 
favorable to bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the economy posted a 1.1% gain from October 
through December, the slimmest quarterly advance in three years, helping slow 
the increase of goods and services to just 3% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The GNP figure didn't do all that much," said Mitchell Held, chief financial 
economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "We're sitting back and 
waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders are waiting for new economic indicators to be released next week, 
especially a report by the nation's purchasing managers and government data on 
unemployment, Held said. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues were down 3/32 point, intermediate maturities declined 1/8 
point to 7/32 point, and long-term issues fell 1/4 point to 3/8 point, 
according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value.

The government declared war on tobacco today, approving a draft law banning all 
cigarette advertising and announcing a 15% increase in the price of tobacco 
products beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, advertisements of nearly all alcoholic beverages will be banned 
except in the print media. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will be submitted to Parliament during its spring session, 
government spokesman Louis Le Pensec said. If approved, the bans will be 
implemented progressively over a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Most cigarettes now cost between 95 cents and $1.75. The government receives 
about 75% of the revenue from tobacco sales. 
</P>
<P>
Le Pensec said tobacco and alcohol are responsible for 20% of the deaths in 
France.

The nation's second-largest check-printing company is offering checks with 
personalized, political messages for consumers who care about abortion, AIDS 
and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Any of 21 messages offered by John H. Harland Co. can be printed on a banner in 
the middle of the check. 
</P>
<P>
On abortion, people may opt for "Pro Choice" or "Pro Life." Those interested in 
the environment may proclaim "Stop Nuclear Power" or "Alternative Energy." 
Other messages include "Stop Child Abuse," "Attack AIDS" and "Seniors Have 
Style." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been proven that they will pay for rainbows and puppies (on checks). It's 
not that far-fetched," said Harland spokesman Bruce Danielson. 
</P>
<P>
The checks were first offered March 1 and sales have not been reported, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Alexander, spokesman for Deluxe Check Printers Inc. in St. Paul, Minn., the 
nation's largest check-printing company, said he doubts that consumers will go 
for the concept. 
</P>
<P>
"Affinity" checks, which allow people to state their loyalty to a school or 
organization, have not been big sellers, he said. "While they seem like a good 
idea at the time, people tend to support their organizations (in other ways)," 
he said. "Someone who is gung-ho on that will open their checkbook and write a 
check for that organization." 
</P>

"People are putting their views on bumper stickers. Why not on their checks?" 
said Charlie Elberson, vice president of Price-McNabb, an Asheville, N.C.,

Dorothy Rodgers, the widow of Richard Rodgers, welcomed the renaming of a 
Broadway theater for the composer of such musicals as "Oklahoma!" "South 
Pacific," "The King and I" and "The Sound of Music." 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a great day for Dick," she said Tuesday at the renaming of the 46th 
Street Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The Richard Rodgers Theater, built in 1924, has been home to some of Broadway's 
biggest musical hits, including "Guys and Dolls," "Damn Yankees" and "How To 
Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." 
</P>
<P>
The theater now contains a permanent exhibit of Rodgers' sheet music, theater 
posters and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, the composer, who died in 1979, was celebrated in song by 
such performers as Rosemary Clooney, Debby Boone, George Hearn and Karen Akers. 
</P>
<P>
"To name just one theater after Richard Rodgers isn't enough," said Rupert 
Holmes, whose new play, "Accomplice," will begin preview performances at the 
theater April 6.

BILLY CRYSTAL'S OSCAR joke angers Italians: Comedian Billy Crystal wasn't very 
funny when he "took a cheap shot" at Italians during Monday night's 62nd Annual 
Academy Awards telecast, two major Italian-American organizations charged 
today. 
</P>
<P>
In separate wires, the Coalition of Italo-American Organizations here and the 
National Italian American Foundation in Washington, D.C., charged that Billy 
insulted them when he joked that the proposed purchase of MGM by an Italian 
businessman would mean the famous lion would no longer roar but take the Fifth 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cheap shot joke against Italian Americans," the Washington-based 
group wired Crystal. "There is a fine line between ethnic humor and negative 
stereotyping. We feel (you) crossed that line." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coalition Chairman William Fugazy said he'd been "inundated" with 
calls from his organization's membership. 
</P>
<P>
NUMBER ONE: Barbara Walters doesn't know it yet but she's the first woman to be 
named recipient of the Lowell Thomas Award from Marist College in Poughkeepsie. 
She's on vacation in the Middle East until April 11. Previous winners include 
Walter Cronkite, Eric Severeid, David Brinkley and Howard K. Smith. The award 
will be presented at a luncheon on April 19 at the Helmsley Palace. 
</P>
<P>
NIXON ON TAPE: Richard M. Nixon now says that he doesn't think he should have 
accepted a pardon from Gerald R. Ford because it was seen by many as an 
admission of guilt, the former President asserts in the three-hour recorded 
version of his new memoir "In the Arena." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon states: "In retrospect, I would say that Watergate was one part 
wrongdoing, one part blundering and one part political vendetta. By far, the 
hardest blow was the pardon. My primary reason for resigning was to avoid 
having a President of the United States in the dock for alleged illegal 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
'GYPSY' TO GET new leading lady? There may be some "Gypsy" in Linda Lavin's 
soul. The Tony Award winner is at the front of the line to replace Tyne Daly in 
the starring role of the hit musical revival at the St. James. Daly is signed 
up until the end of July.

A cardboard Bill Cosby is an unofficial member of the staff of San Francisco 
Mayor Art Agnos but not everyone approves of the way Agnos uses the life-size 
cutout. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos keeps the cardboard Cosby in an office closet and drags it out for 
prominent black visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor says the idea is to encourage minorities to invest in their 
communities like Cosby does. 
</P>
<P>
"He's terrific," Agnos says of Cosby, who gave $20 million to Spelman College 
in Atlanta, Ga. "You know why? Because he's doing what the Greeks are doing, 
what the Jews are doing, what the Chinese are doing and what everyone else in 
the world is doing. He says, 'We successful blacks have to invest in our 
communities and we haven't been doing it. And if we don't do it, we aren't 
going to succeed.' " Toni Cook, former head of the Bay Area Black United Fund, 
doesn't like the tactic. "It floored me," she said. "I thought it was most 
inappropriate. As a professional, I found it very insulting to be the brunt of 
his frustration."

TRACK STAR IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER HAMMER HITS HER IN FACE

<P>
A 20-year-old track and field star was critically injured when she was hit in 
the face by a 16-pound hammer thrown by another student during track practice 
at Sacramento City College. 
</P>
<P>
After 14 hours of surgery Monday, Samira Taylor remained in critical condition 
at University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Her family said she suffered a skull fracture and numerous broken bones in her 
face, eyes and nose. 
</P>
<P>
Susie Williams, director of community and media relations for the Los Rios 
Community College District, said initial reports indicated that Taylor had been 
practicing the discus throw, completed her toss and "for some reason she came 
back into the (track) area" where the other student was making his throw. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was a star athlete at Grant and Rio Linda High schools. In 1988, she was 
honored by the Sacramento Bee as one of the city's best prep track and field 
athletes. That year she began the season with the city's longest girls' discus 
throw of 129 feet, 9 1/2 inches. She also had the second-longest shot put throw 
of 40.2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, track team member Dave Reneau, 22, who saw the accident, said he 
remained shaken by what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel guilty and wish I could accept some of that pain. Tragedy seems to 
always happens to the good people. And she is such a very, very nice girl. She 
was a standout athlete -- disciplined -- and track was her ticket out."

KIMBLE TO AID GATHERS' FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Kimble, the eye of an emotional hurricane that carried the Loyola Marymount 
Lions within a game of the Final Four, promises to do whatever he can 
financially to sustain Hank Gathers' family. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, who played high school ball with Gathers on a city championship 
basketball team at Philadelphia's Dobbins Tech, revealed Tuesday that he will 
provide Gathers' family with financial assistance after he signs what promises 
to be a lucrative NBA contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to make sure that they'll be able to live a good life," 
said Kimble, who had not immediately discussed the matter with Gathers' mother 
Lucille. 
</P>
<P>
"The Gathers family is like family to me. I would be willing to help them with 
their essential needs. If it comes out of my pocket, that's OK, because I'm a 
very giving person. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way I'm going to be making as much money as a Michael Jordan, but 
if I do, everyone in the Gathers family will be OK financially." 
</P>
<P>
The players and coaches from the 1989-90 Loyola Marymount basketball team took 
one final ride together Tuesday, on a Los Angeles County fire engine that took 
them to a campus pep rally. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble grabbed a microphone and told an upbeat crowd of about 1,500 students 
and faculty: "I've decided to quit basketball and become a fireman." 
</P>
<P>
They can laugh again on the grassy Westchester campus, less than a month after 
enduring the darkest moment in the school's athletic history, when Gathers 
collapsed on the court during a conference tournament game and died less than 
two hours later from a diseased heart. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been holding up pretty well," said Kimble, whose college career ended 
Sunday in Oakland with Loyola's loss to Nevada-Las Vegas after three 
emotionally charged victories in the NCAA Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my moments coming back from the game. . . . I'm a lot stronger than I 
expected, but throughout my life, I think there are going to be different 
stages where it's going to hit me all over again -- like on the plane. But 
overall, I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the tournament, Kimble wore his heart on his shirt -- and on the 
free throw line. Except for the Alabama game, when he didn't get to the foul 
line, he took his first free throw of each game left-handed and made all three. 
It was to honor Gathers, whose free throw deficiency caused him to switch from 
his right hand to his left. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't whether I made it or not. That was just a small part of why I was 
taking it." Kimble said. "I didn't think about having to make it, or about the 
momentum of the game, or whether it was going to be the turning point of the 
game, because it was just my special moment that I took out to think about Hank 
Gathers. As each day progressed, I didn't even work on it because I didn't care 
if I made it or missed it." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, who will graduate in May and then go into the NBA, made one more 
symbolic gesture to honor the memory of his late friend during the rally. A 
backboard was set up behind the podium where each of the players and coaches 
took one more bow. 
</P>
<P>
Because they could not partake in the ritual of cutting down the netting at the 
end of the West Coast Conference tournament -- which was canceled in the wake 
of Gathers' death -- Kimble did the honors Tuesday. And he made the last snip 
left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot has changed in the last few weeks," Coach Paul Westhead said. "These 
players have been around one another on a continual basis, putting their arms 
around each other and hugging each other in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"They would do things like let someone else in line ahead of them at dinner, 
things you wouldn't expect of the normal college player. It's almost like 
that's another team entirely. And that will be a harder team for me to let go 
of, because you don't ever get teams like that."

Georgia Tech is sending its steel mascot, the Rambling Wreck, to Denver to add

In what is thought to be its longest trip ever, the white-and-gold 1930 Model A 
Ford automobile was to be placed gently on a truck today and carried to 
Colorado to help fire up Tech's basketball team for its NCAA Final Four 
semifinal game Saturday night against the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. 
</P>

"We just think that it is very important for one of the greatest traditions of 
Georgia Tech to be with us for one of the greatest moments of Georgia Tech

association.

RACING Q &amp; A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE HIRSCH DAILY RACING FORM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I've read that horses with speed do well around turns. Does it 
follow, then, that a mile race around two turns will suit a speed horse better 
than a mile race out of a chute and thus around only one turn? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "I don't think so," says veteran trainer Harvey Vanier. "It has been my 
experience that many speed horses with distance limitations will forget to stop 
in a mile race out of a chute. I've also seen some speed horses discouraged by 
a race around two turns. There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, but in 
most cases I would prefer to run a speed horse out of a chute, unless the track 
is a 'bull ring' -- less than a mile in circumference." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please settle an argument. Has a horse ever won two races on the same day? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, and it happened at Agricultural Park in Sacramento on Sept. 18, 1876. 
The horse who did it was a filly named Molly McCarty, by Monday out of Hennie 
Farrow, by Shamrock, and she was owned by Theodore Winters. Molly McCarty, who 
was never beaten in six starts as a 3-year-old, won two of those races on the 
same afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In handicapping the races, how much attention should one pay to fractional 
times? 
</P>
<P>
A: "It is nice to know a horse can run fast," says jockey Bill Hartack, now a 
prominent racing official at tracks in the Chicago area. "However, the 
fractional times really don't have great significance. Track conditions and 
pace substantially affect the final times. If the early pace is slow, for 
example, the final time will probably be slow, too. If a horse wins a race 
easily, who knows how fast he might have run? How a horse ran is frequently 
more meaningful than his time or his fractions." 
</P>
<P>
Q: If a jockey does not claim foul, does this influence the opinion of 
officials if there is an incident in the race? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is possible in some instances, but most officials are aware that, (1) 
some jockeys are reluctant to claim foul at any time, (2) some jockeys are 
reluctant to claim foul against certain other jockeys and, (3) some jockeys are 
reluctant to claim foul if they finish farther back than second, so that a 
successful claim can move them up to first. Experienced officials take these 
factors into consideration in adjudicating an incident of the type you cite. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who is considered to be the best steeplechase horse of modern times? 
</P>
<P>
A: By consensus, England's Arkle. He won 27 races over jumps before fracturing 
a hoof in December, 1966. He is best known for three consecutive victories in 
the Cheltenham Gold Cup, a weight-for-age steeplechase at 3 1/2 miles that is 
considered the world's most prestigious jumping feature. Golden Miller, who 
captured the Cheltenham Gold Cup five times between 1932 and 1936, is also 
considered one of the greatest of the greats. Here in America, Neji, a 
three-time champion in the 1950s, and Flatterer, four times champion jumper 
between 1983 and 1986, are considered the best we've had in the steeplechase 
ranks. JOE HIRSCHDAILY RACING FORM

CUBS WERE ALMOST FINE IN 1989, BUT WHAT ABOUT 1990?

Chicago Cubs Manager Don Zimmer started the 1990 season with an admission about 
1989. On the first day of spring training, Zimmer assembled his players in the 
clubhouse of HoHoKam Park and told them exactly what happened in the team's 
woeful showing in the National League Championship Series against the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play worth a darn, and everything I did turned to garbage," Zimmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Does the same fate await Chicago this year? The Cubs are virtually an unchanged 
team from the one that won 93 games. Will they be able to say the same about 
their luck? 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a career 12-19 pitcher named Mike Bielecki provided 18 wins. Jerome 
Walton jumped from Double-A to hit .293. Dwight Smith started the year in 
Triple-A but wound up hitting .324 for the Cubs. Another Triple-A graduate, Les 
Lancaster, threw 30 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings for the Cubs on his way 
to a 1.36 ERA, the lowest among all major-league relievers. And all the while 
Zimmer managed with the nerve of a thief and the luck of a leprechaun. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets had such a hard time fathoming that they lost to this club 
that one player said at the end of the season, "I can't believe I'll be 
watching Jeff Pico and Joe Girardi in the playoffs. Ugh!" 
</P>
<P>
"Last year," Zimmer said, "over 162 games, we were better than the Mets. We 
were the best team in the division. The best team won. This year, to me, the 
Mets should be favored to win. I would say the Mets have an edge because of the 
pitching they have. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are going to pick the Mets. Some are going to pick the Cardinals. 
But I think we have a pretty good division, and I wouldn't rule out anybody, 
including Philadelphia. They could have some young kids develop the way we did 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs won a title but little in the way of respect. They seem to like it 
this way. They came out of nowhere last year. They figure that's a good place 
to start this year too. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen anybody pick us again," reliever Mitch Williams said. "They 
think last year was a fluke. But those experts who are saying we can't win are 
the ones who picked us fifth last year." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has not won back-to-back titles since it won three in a row from 1906 
to '08. The Cubs' 1984 East title looks like an apparition now. Their 96-win 
season six years ago was preceded by 11 consecutive non-winning records and 
followed by seasons of 77, 70, 76 and 77 wins in the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons other than the ones provided by history that appear to be 
working against the Cubs. Their catcher, Damon Berryhill, has not recovered 
from rotator cuff surgery. He is not expected back until mid-May at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Their third baseman is Luis Salazar, a journeyman who has played with a 
different club in each of the last four years. And 35-year-old Andre Dawson, 
who hit .252 last season and .105 in the playoffs, may not be ready for Opening 
Day because of problems with his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest concern about this team is its starting pitching. Although 
Bielecki, Greg Maddux and Rick Sutcliffe were 53-30 last year, the rest of the 
staff was 40-39 -- and that included 11 wins from Scott Sanderson, who signed 
with the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to the Cubs this year largely will depend on what happens in the 
60 or so games that fall to their No. 4 and No. 5 starters. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some candidates," Zimmer said. "We just don't know who the fourth and 
fifth starters are going to be out of that group. That's our most important 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
One spot is likely to go to rookie Mike Harkey, who suffered shoulder and knee 
injuries last year while going 2-7 at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The others being considered are Jose Nunez, who was acquired in a trade with 
Toronto; rookie Kevin Blankenship, Steve Wilson and Pico, who served primarily 
as relievers last year. The five candidates have a combined career record of 
21-19 with a 4.04 ERA. Unless Wilson wins a spot, the rotation will be entirely 
right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a pretty good club," Zimmer said. "We have to find out who our 
four and five pitchers are. If the two guys we choose get the job done, then to 
me, we're going to be a real good club. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you'll ask me, 'Is Jerome Walton going to hit .293 and is Dwight Smith 
going to hit .324 again? Is Mike Bielecki going to win 18 games?' Who knows? Do 
you know? Neither do I."
