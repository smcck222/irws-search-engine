JACK STARRETT, 52; ADVENTURE FILM ACTOR, DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Jack Starrett, who entered films as an actor but will be remembered primarily 
as director of a series of low-budget adventure films, died Monday in a Sherman 
Oaks hospital of liver failure at age 52. 
</P>
<P>
His sister, Dorothy Barry, said he had been ill for some time. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Refugio, Tex., a small town near Corpus Christi, Starrett worked in

Blood Apache," "Cleopatra Jones," "Race With the Devil," "Final Chapter --

SAID MUFTI; FORMER JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Said Mufti, about 90, a former Jordanian prime minister who helped lead his 
country into becoming an independent kingdom. Mufti was one of Jordan's 
best-known citizens during its 68-year history. The nation existed first as an 
emirate under British protection and later as an independent monarchy. A strong 
nationalist, Mufti balked at a 1928 constitutional agreement with Britain, 
arguing that it gave away too much influence on Jordanian affairs to the 
British. Under a League of Nations mandate Britain had been responsible for the 
old state of Trans-Jordan, which became the independent monarchy of Jordan in 
1926. Later, as prime minister from April to December, 1950, Mufti opposed 
negotiations with Israel. In a second term, beginning in 1956, he opposed the 
Baghdad Pact, a U.S.-supported plan to create a belt of anti-Communist nations 
from Turkey to Iran. Mufti had served in Jordanian cabinets from 1929 until the 
early 1960s, often as deputy prime minister or interior minister. The state-run 
Jordanian television network reported Mufti's death but did not say how old he 
was or where he had died. The network did say he died Saturday.

LEWIS W. WALT; WAS ASSISTANT MARINE LEADER

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired Gen. Lewis W. Walt, a former assistant commandant of the Marine Corps 
and holder of several combat decorations from three wars, has died at the Naval 
Home in Gulfport, Miss., after a long illness, the service said this week. He 
was 76. 
</P>
<P>
Walt, a rough-spoken bear of a man who served as assistant commandant of the 
corps from Jan. 1, 1968, until Feb. 1, 1971, died Sunday, Marine officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
From 1965 to 1967 he commanded the 75,000 Marines in the I Corps area of 
northern South Vietnam. There legends abounded about him as he survived mortar 
attacks that hit within a few feet of him and a walk across a mined bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Born near Harveyville, Kan., he graduated from Colorado State University where 
he served in the Reserve Officers Training Corps and was commissioned a second 
lieutenant in the Army Reserve. He later resigned the commission to become a 
second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on July 1, 1936, beginning a military 
career that spanned nearly 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
In World War II he served with the 1st Marine Raider Battalion in the Pacific 
and by 1944 was commanding the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Marines in the campaign 
for New Britain, where he was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
By the outbreak of the Korean War he was a colonel and served as a regimental 
commander in that Asian war zone. 
</P>
<P>
He was promoted to brigadier general in 1962, was made a major general three 
years later and was given his third star the following year. In January, 1968, 
after failing to become Marine Corps commandant in a competition with Lt. Gen. 
Victor H. Krulak and Lt. Gen. Leonard F. Chapman Jr., he received his fourth 
star and served as assistant commandant. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the corps had only one four-star officer, the commandant, and 
Walt's appointment was seen as a gesture of appreciation even though Chapman 
had been chosen commandant. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, he was awarded two Navy Crosses, two Distinguished Service 
Medals, a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Walt retired from active duty in February, 1971, and later wrote three books 
and several other articles. 
</P>
<P>
In one of them, a 1971 article for the New York Times, he wrote of the 
dichotomies of Vietnam: 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand it was an extremely sophisticated war with complex weapons 
unlike even World War II or Korea. On the other hand it was a return to 
medieval war, pitting man against man on a battleground where only the 
courageous could win."

MALCOLM COWLEY; ESSAYIST CHRONICLED LITERARY HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Author and literary historian Malcolm Cowley, whose influential and elegant 
essays chronicled more than six decades of American letters, died Tuesday after 
an apparent heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Cowley, 90, was stricken at his home in Sherman, Conn., medical officials said, 
and died later at a hospital in nearby New Milford. 
</P>
<P>
As literary editor for the New Republic from 1929 to 1944, Cowley's lead review 
"brought to focus for people to whom this page . . . represented the most 
dramatically satisfying confrontation of a new book by a gifted, uncompromising 
critical intelligence," critic Alfred Kazin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Cowley was one of what Gertrude Stein called the "Lost Generation" of 
expatriate American writers in Paris after World War I -- a group that included 
Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
With a firmly grounded confidence in his own judgment, he recognized the 
brilliance of that generation. His "Portable Faulkner," published in 1946, is 
credited with rescuing the novelist from obscurity. Within a few years, 
Faulkner won the Nobel Prize for literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Cowley was a living bridge, both in his genial person and his engaging, shrewd 
criticism, with the generation that were young in the '20s," author John Updike 
said in a statement. "His reactions to and perceptions of Hemingway, 
Fitzgerald, Faulkner and (John) Dos Passos are invaluable. He was an energetic 
and gregarious man who lived the life of the mind with gusto and good nature." 
</P>
<P>
Born Aug. 24, 1898, in Belsano, Pa., Cowley attended what he called "dreadfully 
snobbish" Harvard University for two years before leaving in 1917 to become an 
ambulance driver in France. 
</P>
<P>
Cowley returned to Harvard in 1918 and graduated cum laude in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
Although he would have preferred to work on his poetry, necessity forced him to 
take free-lance writing assignments to support himself after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
A fellowship allowed him to study French literature for two years in France, 
where he became part of the enormously gifted circle of American writers living 
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the U.S. in 1923, and began compiling his poems with 
encouragement from his friend, Hart Crane. Six years later, critics celebrated 
the collection of 56 poems, "Blue Juniata." Cowley regarded the publication of 
his poems as the end of his literary apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
"As a document of the first post-war generation, it is unique," critic Allen 
Tate said of the collection. "Cowley's generation appeared after the war had 
given the 'genteel tradition' and the provincial ways of life in America a 
staggering blow." 
</P>
<P>
Cowley's "Exile's Return: A Narrative of Ideas," the book for which he is best 
known, deals with 1920s writers who naively attempted to pursue art as a way of 
life in Paris and Greenwich Village. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his writing, Cowley had brief brushes with academia -- teaching a 
semester at various universities, including Stanford and UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
He looked at creative writing teachers who had spent their entire careers on a 
campus with a wary eye. "They teach creative writing and they never do 
anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, Cowley published his 18 years of correspondence with Faulkner. In 
1967, he produced a collection of his essays and reviews from the New Republic 
and other periodicals. He published a "A Second Flowering: Works and Days of 
the Lost Generation," in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Cowley is survived by his wife, Muriel; one son, Robert, of New York; four 
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

76ERS PULL OUT A 117-115 VICTORY OVER CELTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody wants to play the Detroit Pistons in the best-of-five series that opens 
the playoffs in the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons aren't just the team with the best record in the league, they are 
the team coming up to the playoffs with the most momentum. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round the Pistons figure to play either Philadelphia or Boston. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the reasons why the 76ers and Celtics engaged in a playoff-type 
game Tuesday night at Philadelphia. The team that finishes with the seventh 
best record in the East plays New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who went into the game 1 1/2 games behind the 76ers, have a poor 
road record and were without injured Kevin McHale, but it still took the best 
of Charles Barkley for the 76ers to pull out a 117-115 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had 27 points, 12 rebounds and three steals in another superb 
performance. He made a dunk with 27 seconds left in regulation to tie the 
score, 102-102. Then, he made a free throw with 34 seconds left in the extra 
period and it proved decisive, forcing Dennis Johnson to miss a free throw on 
purpose with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who have played almost the entire season without their best 
player, Larry Bird, now have McHale out with a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
Although they didn't win, the Celtics still have 14 games remaining and they 
are playing better than the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Especially encouraging is the play of youngsters Reggie Lewis and rookie Brian 
Shaw. Lewis had a career-high 39 points, while Shaw, the 6-foot-6 guard from UC 
Santa Barbara, had 18 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie also was big for the 76ers. Hersey Hawkins had eight of his 21 points 
in the five-minute overtime. His three-point basket with 1:24 left in overtime 
gave the 76ers a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 111, Atlanta 108 -- The Nets, beaten by Miami by 21 points Monday 
night, turned on the Hawks in this game at East Rutherford, N.J., to end a 
10-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Hinson scored six of his 25 points in the last two minutes to give the 
lowly Nets their first win against the Hawks after 16 consecutive defeats. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hinson's 10-foot jumper with 14 seconds left that clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning loss dropped the Hawks two games behind Chicago in the battle for 
fourth place in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 130, Washington 114 -- With a chance to close in on the Celtics in 
their try for the final playoff spot in the East, the Bullets played one of 
their poorest games. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Anderson scored 29 points and Alvin Robertson 28 to lead the weak Spurs 
to just their 19th victory in 69 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs went to the front early and seemed to get better after Coach Larry 
Brown was ejected after picking up two technicals in the second quarter. They 
soared to a 23-point lead in the third quarter before easing off. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 115, Golden State 106 -- Every time Michael Jordan sets a goal, he 
accomplishes it. First, he decided to become a scoring champ and he did that 
with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Then last year he decided to become the best defensive player. He did. 
</P>
<P>
After Bulls' Coach Doug Collins decided his team would be better with Jordan at 
the point guard instead of the shooting guard, Jordan had a new goal -- -- to 
become the best playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's been at it for only 10 games, Jordan has already served notice to 
John Stockton and Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, in this game at Chicago, scored 33 points and has his second 
consecutive triple-double as the Bulls won their fifth in a row. The previous 
four were at the conclusion of a trip West. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had 12 rebounds and 11 assists as the Bulls handed the Warriors their 
fourth consecutive defeat and seventh in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors built a 52-47 lead late in the third quarter but Horace Grant 
scored on a turnaround jumper that ignited a 19-4 spurt that put the Bulls in 
command. 
</P>
<P>
New York 128, Portland 124 -- Mark Jackson, just recently returned after knee 
surgery, had a triple-double at New York and Kiki Vandeweghe, in his first game 
against his old mates, had 24 points to lead the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson had 21 of his 27 points in the second half to hold off the determined 
Trail Blazers. He also had 10 rebounds and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 120, Seattle 117 -- Akeem Olajuwon scored 17 of his 36 points in the 
pivotal fourth quarter at Houston and the Rockets needed them all to hold off 
the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
The other Rockets scored only seven points in the 12 minutes against the 
Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 102, Dallas 90 -- Almost every other team has been hammering the 
hapless Mavericks lately, but the Cavaliers struggled for more than a half at 
Richfield, Ohio before handing Dallas its 11th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper saved them. He scored 15 of his points in a 26-11 spurt late in the 
third quarter that broke open a close game. DAN HAFNER

SABRES SECURE HOLD ON THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Parker scored twice Tuesday night at Buffalo to lead the Sabres to a 4-2 
victory over Hartford and strengthen the Sabres' hold on third place in the 
Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Whalers and Sabres have three games remaining, but the Sabres have a 
four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of finishing third is that the team doesn't have to meet the 
powerful Montreal Canadiens in the opening round of the Stanley Cup 
competition. Instead the team will play Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The way the Sabres played in the first period, they didn't appear to be ready 
to increase their lead. They had only one shot on goal in the first period and 
trailed, 1-0, near the middle of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
But goals by Ray Sheppard and Parker put the Sabres ahead and from then on they 
dominated play. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's second goal early in the third period made it a two-goal lead and the 
Sabres were in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo plays at Montreal and at Quebec before returning home to play the New 
York Islanders Sunday. The Whalers play Pittsburgh and Boston at home and 
Chicago on the road. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, Washington 4 -- One advantage of being knocked out of the 
playoffs is the chance to give experience to rookies. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders have found several good ones. The newest, Mike Walsh, scored two 
goals, including the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals, in their first game since clinching the Patrick Division, didn't 
seem to have their hearts in the game against the team with the worst record.

"On Academy Award night, be a winner! Win $25,000 ... Beat the Greek!" For the 
last couple of weeks, there have been hordes of Oscar promotions around the 
country, some sanctioned by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, 
and some not. The above lines appeared in a full-page advertisement in last 
week's People magazine, and it was definitely not sanctioned, said Bruce Davis, 
executive administrator of the academy. "Our lawyers are exploring that with 
some vigor," Davis said about the ad that asks participants to choose the 
winners of five Oscar categories by dialing a dollar-a-minute 900 number. "We 
don't mind newspaper promotions, but when it's a cash-generating deal, we 
intend to protect our copyright," Davis said. The ad, which includes a photo of 
defrocked TV sports expert Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder holding up a telephone and 
a handful of bills, was placed by International Gaming Management and listed a 
Council Bluffs, Iowa, post office box. The phone company in Council Bluffs does 
not have a listing for International Gaming Management, and there was no answer 
Tuesday at the company's Manhasset, N.Y., office. Snyder could not be reached 
for comment either. ALEENE MacMINN and Jack Mathews

Entertainment Data also handicapped the 1988 Oscar field as if it were the 
Breeders' Cup and published its analyses in an eight-sheet brochure laid out 
like The Daily Racing Form. The company's Academy Award Handicap makes "Rain 
Man" a solid pick as best picture (each of the last six best picture winners 
led the field in nominations, as "Rain Man" does this year); "Mississippi 
Burning" cannot win because its screenplay was not nominated (previous nominees 
in this predicament went 0-for-6); and "Dangerous Liaisons" is out because it 
has done the least box-office business of the five nominated films (past low 
grosser nominees have also gone 0-for-6). The handicap also rates Dustin 
Hoffman the favorite for best actor, and Glenn Close and Jodie Foster 
nose-to-nose for best actress. ALEENE MacMINN and Jack Mathews

What is an Oscar worth? A study done by Entertainment Data Inc. predicts that 
the producers of the best picture winner can count on a cool $20-million 
windfall. At least, that has been the average post-Oscar box office on the best 
picture winners since "Gandhi" swept the board in 1982. "Gandhi" did 73% of its 
$52.7 million theatrical business after the Academy Award nominations were 
announced that year. Of the best picture winners in the last six years, 1983's 
"Terms of Endearment" was least affected by the Oscar (it grossed $14.5 million 
after winning the big prize), but it had been an immediate box office hit and 
was almost played out when the Oscars were given. Other best picture winners 
and their post-Academy Award victory performances: "Amadeus" (1984), $17.5 
million; "Out of Africa" (1985), $17.4 million; "Platoon" (1986), $35.2 
million; "The Last Emperor" (1987), $18.9 million. Of course, what the study 
doesn't show, and no one knows, is how much these films would have earned if 
they'd lost. ALEENE MacMINN and Jack Mathews

Come Fly With Me: MGM Grand Air, the all-first class airline that flies twice 
daily from each coast, is offering a perk to tonight's Oscar winners. Instead 
of the usual $3,600 one-way fare for a private luxurious compartment, those 
"special few" flying home with a golden statue will get a reduced rate of only 
$2,817 for a four-seat compartment. "Since MGM Grand Air caters to many people 
from the entertainment community, we wanted to do something special to 
commemorate those who have excelled in their field," explained Charles L. 
Demoney, the airline's chief executive and president. "We would be honored to 
fly the Academy Award winners and their Oscars." The airline's 727s seat only 
33, have five flight attendants and a choice of six films (which may or may not 
be Oscar winners). ALEENE MacMINN and Jack Mathews

'SINFUL LIFE' JUST RIGHT FOR MORRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dancer-actress Anita Morris, with her torrid red mane and outrageously 
voluptuous torso, comes close to being the human equivalent of Roger Rabbit's 
Jessica. She can turn herself into an incarnation of all-American pneumatic 
sex. But up to now, Morris, who is terrific in small doses, hasn't really 
adjusted her stage style to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
In "A Sinful Life" (opening today for a two-week run at the Nuart), Morris has 
exactly the right kind of role. She plays a sexy, soused, self-parodying 
dream-goddess of chintzy lust. The movie is a low-budget version of the recent 
L.A. Groundlings play "Just Like the Pom Pom Girls," and Morris has the star 
role of Claire Vin Blanc, which playwright-scenarist-actress Melanie Graham 
played on stage. It's a ripe, fruity, delectable role and, in it, Morris' 
zaftig hamminess billows happily against the movie's other star turn: Blair 
Tefkin as the surreally arrested, time-warped Baby. 
</P>
<P>
Tefkin's Baby is a weird, fiercely grinning, nasal-compulsive descendant of 
Lily Tomlin's snuffling tots and Fanny Brice's Baby Snooks. (The 20ish Tefkin's 
age is never rationalized.) And her mama, Morris' Claire, is the ultimate 
Hollywood poseur: a "retired" dancer-floozy-hooker living in blowzily cheerful 
squalor in the Franklin-Cahuenga area. 
</P>
<P>
Drifting along in a semi-alcoholic slothful haze, lazily lapsing into casual 
affairs with the janitor (Rick Overton), seducing her sanctimonious, 
Bible-thumping neighbor (Dennis Christopher) to obtain her ideal of aesthetic 
furnishing -- a peach-colored love seat -- Claire Vin Blanc somehow incarnates 
part of the soul of '80s Hollywood. She's the rental queen of that partially 
gutted little dream ghetto, ringed with cherished landmarks, side streets 
crammed with drug dealers, prostitutes and wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
The villains here are macho slobs, meddling bureaucrats, fatties and religious 
fanatics. The good guys are retired show-biz types, hookers, bizarrely 
overgrown children and wisecracking transvestites: eccentrics with style. It's 
a frivolous piece that plays like a bawdy, opportunistic sitcom. But director 
William Schreiner, who also staged the Groundlings version, knows where the 
laughs are. Mostly, he pushes the right buttons. Sometimes, as in one bout of 
cockroach lust, he pushes too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"A Sinful Life" (MPAA-rated R, for sex and language) is basically sound 
stage-bound with occasional soft-focus outdoor excursions. It ignores what 
might have been a wonderful modern location: contemporary central Hollywood. A 
shame. This area is an untapped resource, a great sleazy, pungently human 
reservoir for which Claire Vin Blanc would have been a perfect off-centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
It's another case of life wasted in the movies, in a story, ironically, about 
how movie dreams can sinfully waste a life.

'VOYAGE' TO A THREATENED PLANET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Life in the Balance," an "Infinite Voyage" special airing at 8 tonight on 
Channels 28, 15 and 24 and at 8 p.m. Monday on Channel 11, opens with a strong 
dose of statistics detailing mankind's impact on our fragile planet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Airborne pollutants released each year: 5 billion tons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Population expected in the year 2000: 6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rain forest destroyed every minute: 50 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive statistics, all of them. Unfortunately, "Life in the Balance" never 
lets up, affecting a preachy tone that limits its impact. 
</P>
<P>
And that's too bad, because that approach by producer-writer Joe Seamans gets 
in the way of some very interesting material. 
</P>
<P>
In segments on fragile ecosystems in Brazil, Peru, San Diego and Costa Rica, 
Seamans shows how technological advances are fragmenting the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"Life in the Balance" demonstrates how all of the Earth's species are closely 
linked, explains how we are causing mass extinction of many of these species 
and shows how scientists are attempting to cope with the myriad problems. As 
one scientist puts it, "Man can be considered a human meteorite" in ecological 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
The program hammers home its point about man's negative role in evolution 
through this ongoing process of mass extinction. Our rapacious species is 
clearly overshadowing the planet, destroying plants, insects, fish and mammals 
at an astounding rate, tipping the balance in who knows what direction. After 
all, no one knows which species will turn out to be the "key" species in the 
food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Preachiness aside, "Life in the Balance" is, on balance, a worthy effort, as 
timely as today's headlines about the Valdez oil spill. We stand at a unique 
spot in history: Mankind has recognized the problems and has the power to help 
stem this mass extinction. The question remains: Do we have the will?

SAN DIEGO LOSES AMERICA'S CUP; 
</P>
<P>
CONNER'S USE OF CATAMARAN RULED TO BE VIOLATION OF GOVERNING DEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a ruling unprecedented in the 138-year history of the America's Cup, a judge 
Tuesday said that Dennis Conner and the San Diego Yacht Club violated the 
spirit of fair competition called for in the Cup's rules and awarded sailing's 
most prestigious trophy to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
New York Supreme Court Judge Carmen Ciparick decided that, by racing a 
catamaran against a monohull last September, San Diego had created a "gross 
mismatch" not in accordance with the "friendly competition between foreign 
countries" intended by the author of the 19th Century Deed of Gift governing 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited decision by the New York court, which has jurisdiction over 
the interpretation of Cup rules, was a shocking blow not only to the sailing 
community, but to the city of San Diego, which was expecting a billion-dollar 
bonanza from hosting the next scheduled Cup regatta in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the both the San Diego Yacht Club and the America's Cup Organizing 
Committee (ACOC) criticized the judge for what one high-ranking ACOC member 
called a legal "flip-flop." The lawyer representing the yacht club said 
bluntly: "We've been had." 
</P>
<P>
Those officials gave every indication that they expect to appeal the judge's 
ruling, but a decision probably won't be made until today at the earliest. They 
said they had to analyze the 14-page ruling and would be guided by "what is 
best for the America's Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the moment skipper Dennis Conner won the Cup for the San Diego 
Yacht Club during races off the coast of Fremantle, Australia, in February, 
1987, the Cup has been under siege. First there was a months-long controversy 
over where the next regatta would be held -- San Diego or Hawaii -- in what 
amounted to a bidding war, and then merchant banker Michael Fay of New Zealand 
stepped into the vacuum and issued an unusual one-on-one challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The gambit by Fay sent the contest once determined by sailors at sea into the 
hands of lawyers and the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Fay's challenge, which called for him to race off the coast of San Diego in a 
$10-million, 123-foot monohull, was upheld by the New York court in November, 
1987, touching off a decision by an angry San Diego Yacht Club and the Sail 
America Foundation, ACOC's predecessor, to "dispose" of Fay's maverick 
challenge as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
</P>
<P>
What the San Diegans were seeking was a guaranteed victory, and that led Conner 
and the yacht club to select a 60-foot catamaran, a boat clearly faster than 
Fay's monohull. No catamaran had ever raced for the Cup, and the San Diegans 
defended their unusual choice, which was criticized by many in the yachting 
world for being unsportsmanlike, as legal under the Cup's racing rules embodied 
in the 1887 Deed of Gift. 
</P>
<P>
Last September off Point Loma, the two vessels raced in a best-of-three series. 
The result was an anti-climactic blowout for the San Diego Yacht Club and 
Conner, who won the first two races by wide margins. The loss sent Fay back to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Judge Ciparick sharply criticized the San Diego Yacht Club for 
selecting a catamaran and said the club fell short of its responsibility as a 
trustee of the Cup. Acknowledging that forfeiture is an extreme remedy, the 
judge said she had no choice but to turn over the Cup to Fay and his Mercury 
Bay Boating Club Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Aware of Risk' 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego was well aware of the risk it ran when it chose to follow the 
unprecedented course of defending in a catamaran," the judge said in her 
ruling. "Barely paying lip service to the significance of the competition, its 
clear goal was to retain the Cup at all costs so that it could host a 
competition on its own terms. San Diego thus violated the spirit of the Deed 
(of Gift). 
</P>
<P>
According to the judge, "The holder of the America's Cup is bound to a higher 
obligation than the victory of the Stanley Cup or the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation of Cup racing, since its inception in 1851, the judge wrote, is 
fair competition, and the use of a catamaran so strayed from that concept, that 
"accordingly, San Diego shall be disqualified. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that a catamaran may not defend in America's Cup competition 
against a monohull." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Ciparick's decision came at 5:25 a.m. Auckland time and set 
off impromptu celebrations throughout the city of 1 million, which calls itself 
"the city of sails" because of the high interest in the sport. Joggers stopped 
their early-morning exercise to discuss the news, and a fireboat motored into 
Auckland Harbor to spray its hoses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fay Informed 
</P>
<P>
Fay, who has devoted himself to a dogged pursuit of the Cup, was awakened by a 
phone call from aide Alan Sefton, who told him of the decision. Then Fay went 
for his own morning jog, receiving congratulations from his countrymen along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Fay reacted to his courtroom victory with restrained celebration, saying he 
expects New Zealand to host a Cup regatta in April, 1991, that will feature 
yachts from countries throughout the world. Before Tuesday's ruling, San Diego 
had also scheduled a Cup regatta off Point Loma for May, 1991, which 25 foreign 
challengers had already entered. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego went off on a tangent, if you could say that," Fay told Radio New 
Zealand. "Even when we offered to delay the race, they didn't seem to want to 
play the game. That was a big disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
"We have always been strong in our belief about what the Cup meant." Fay said. 
"The America's Cup is the winner. The Deed works." 
</P>
<P>
Conner was traveling abroad and unreachable for comment. Neither was Malin 
Burnham, head of the Sail America Foundation, a member of the ACOC and, along 
with Conner, the principal force behind the victory of the Stars &amp; Stripes 
yachts in both Fremantle and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, San Diego Yacht Club Commodore Patrick 
Goddard and other officials closed ranks behind Conner, saying that, despite 
the court ruling, the yacht club supports Conner and the decision to race in a 
catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for me to say that the decision to defend in a catamaran was a 
joint decision" made by the yacht club and the Sail America Foundation, which 
was in charge of conducting the regatta and raising money for Stars &amp; 
Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm personally proud of Dennis Conner and John Marshall (chief designer of 
Stars &amp; Stripes)," Goddard said. "I'm personally feeling great 
disappointment and a great amount of confusion about the judge's decision." 
</P>
<P>
He said there are no deep divisions within the club about the use of the 
catamaran. "We stand as one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Smith, one of the attorneys representing the yacht club, criticized the 
judge for what he said was her reversal in reasoning from earlier Cup decisions 
involving the club and Fay. "Our feeling is that we've been had," Smith said. 
"It's inexplicable to me . . . how she would write what she did." 
</P>
<P>
He said the club will retain physical custody of the Cup until the appeals 
process is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Ehman, executive vice president of the ACOC, said the judge "has done a 
180-degree flip-flop." He said that, based on her earlier decisions in the 
matter, "none of us (would) do anything differently." 
</P>
<P>
Although an appeal seems likely, Ehman said both the yacht club and the ACOC 
must weigh how "dragging it out" affects the Cup. Ehman noted that, under a new 
"protocol" agreed to in the last three months among Cup challengers -- 
including the selection of a new America's Cup racing yacht -- the likelihood 
of future challenges such as Fay's is now improbable. 
</P>
<P>
Among those most disappointed with Tuesday's ruling was Gerry Driscoll, a 
veteran America's Club sailor from San Diego who served on the America's Cup 
Committee, the group formed in 1987 to pick where the next regatta would be 
held. 
</P>
<P>
It was Driscoll who became the most visible opponent of the yacht club's 
decision to race Fay in a catamaran, saying a race between a multihull boat and 
a monohull boat was both a mismatch and not in keeping with the tradition of 
yachting. On Tuesday, Driscoll, who owns a boatyard on Shelter Island, said he 
felt greatly for his yacht club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a sad bit of history for the San Diego Yacht Club to write," he 
said. He noted that, even though Conner overwhelmed Fay in September, many 
sailing experts felt the catamaran wasn't sailed to its potential and could 
have gone much faster. Of the result, he said, "It was nothing we can be proud 
of." 
</P>
<P>
Among those reacting to the ruling was San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who 
implied that the judge is a political pawn of the New York Yacht Club, which 
held custody of the Cup until 1984, when it was captured by Australian Alan 
Bond. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say this decision was politically motivated, but we all know the New 
York Yacht Club wanted the Cup to go to New Zealand so they could compete for 
it on foreign soil in 1991," she said. Under Cup rules, the only way an 
American yacht club can recapture custody of the Cup is to win it back from a 
foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision is unfortunate for San Diego because we stand to lose hundreds of 
millions of dollars and the international media attention that would go with 
the race. I hope that the San Diego Yacht Club will vigorously appeal the 
ruling. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
For others, the loss of the Cup will be felt economically. Tom Armstrong, 
general manager of Ensenada Express, which chartered boats to both Conner and 
Fay and the media last September, said that, if the decision stands, "we'll 
lose at least . . . $200,000" in business he was anticipating in 1991.

LOWERY LAMBASTES SCHOOL OVER TREATMENT OF ROGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO and H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Describing Sharon Rogers as "very, very distressed," a San Diego congressman 
Tuesday blasted La Jolla Country Day School administrators for first firing her 
as a teacher, and now trying to negotiate a new contract and return her to the 
campus by next year. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) also asked the head of the Naval Investigative 
Service to examine the school grounds and determine what would have to be done 
to properly secure the school should the popular fourth-grade instructor be 
allowed to resume teaching there. 
</P>
<P>
And he is seeking a "counter-terrorism briefing" at the school in which experts 
would meet with faculty, administrators and parents to discuss how best to deal 
with unanswered questions and fears since the March 10 bombing of Rogers' van. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a sham," Lowery said in a statement released through his San Diego 
office, scoring school officials for what he describes as flip-flopping in 
their treatment of Rogers in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ineffective. And they are further damaging the school and polarizing 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
"This should be a time for supporting Sharon Rogers, for standing unified 
against terrorism and for healing the wounds that have been inflicted upon this 
community and the Rogers family," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Roth, a public relations specialist from Pasadena who was hired by 
the school to act as its official spokesman in the continuing controversy over 
Rogers' tenure at La Jolla Country Day, said Tuesday that the school genuinely 
is trying to act responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that the community will pull together in seeing that we are 
trying to honor two values here," he said. "The value of physical safety for 
the children and the other value of having Sharon Rogers do what she does so 
well: Teach her fourth-grade children." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials investigating the blast believe a pipe bomb was placed under 
the vehicle in retaliation for the order by her husband, Navy Capt. Will Rogers 
III, to shoot down an Iranian airplane last summer in the Persian Gulf. The 
missile from the ship, the Vincennes, destroyed an Iran Air commercial liner, 
killing all 290 persons aboard. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, crew members of his ship passed out flyers in the La Jolla area 
seeking information leading to the arrest of the persons who bombed the van. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rogers could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But officials in Lowery's 
office said she has told them she was perturbed by the school's new position of 
suddenly wanting her to come back. 
</P>
<P>
"She found it very, very distressing," said Karl B. Higgins, district director 
of the Republican congressman's office in San Diego. "And by that I mean the 
issuance of public relations double-speak and attempting to pussyfoot around 
the situation involving her employment and potential return. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an expression, on her part, of frustration. There is an extreme 
displeasure in the way this has been handled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Wants to Teach, Plain and Simple' 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to teach, plain and simple. But why would she want to go back to La 
Jolla Country Day after they have fired her and deceived the public about their 
relationship? What kind of atmosphere does that produce?" 
</P>
<P>
Navy and school officials said Mrs. Rogers and school Headmaster Timothy M. 
Burns were hoping to meet soon to discuss a new contract offer for the 1989-90 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
While several sources, including Lowery and former La Jolla Country Day board 
member Ron Gravette, maintain that Rogers was forced out, Roth announced Monday 
that the school wanted to present her with new options for her returning in 
some capacity to the campus for the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, if "100% security" can be assured, she will be allowed back on 
campus as a teacher. If not, he said, she can work off-campus by preparing 
lessons and handling duties for the school alumni association. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be three or four conversations before we iron out what her role is 
going to be," Roth said. "You have to realize we are in an area that is 
unprecedented. A lot of options have to be examined." 
</P>
<P>
The school spokesman also said that Lowery's request for an examination of the 
school and its security needs, along with a counter-terrorism briefing, "would 
be welcomed with open arms." 
</P>
<P>
"We have all along been interested in getting as much professional information 
and professional expertise on how best to secure the campus," he said. "We have 
all along been hoping we can get people professionally trained in this field to 
get information and recommendations on how best to proceed with security 
measures." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Knee-Jerk Response' 
</P>
<P>
But Lowery insisted that the school has acted inappropriately in the matter: 
"Sharon Rogers was fired by La Jolla Country Day in an obvious over-reaction 
and knee-jerk response to the bombing incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The most constructive action that La Jolla County Day could engage in today 
would be to admit their mistake, fire the public relations flack from Pasadena 
and contribute the funds that are going towards professional damage control 
into a constructive use, such as the reward fund." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, "they have shot themselves in the foot again by releasing 
half-truths (about her job status) and misstatements and by placing 
unreasonable demands on Sharon Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
Gravette, who resigned from the exclusive school's governing board in the midst 
of the controversy, said in a radio interview Tuesday that Rogers was never 
really allowed a chance to save her job at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fait accompli," he told station XTRA AM. "She was in the board room, 
and she was not going to be returning to the school." 
</P>
<P>
He said that school administrators also were worried that, if she did not leave

In another development Tuesday, a group of eight sailors from Capt. Rogers' 
ship, the Vincennes, spent the day at three area shopping malls passing out 
flyers from San Diego Crime Stoppers announcing a $37,000 reward for the arrest 
and conviction of those responsible for the bombing.

SKIPPER TO QUIT NAVY AFTER TRIAL IN REFUGEE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Alexander Balian, the Navy skipper convicted last month of dereliction of 
duty for failing to rescue a boatload of Vietnamese refugees, said Tuesday that 
he is resigning from the Navy after 26 years because he believes he will never 
again be allowed to command a ship. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the Navy assigning me to a command at sea again, which is what I 
love, so I intend to pursue endeavors that will give me similar satisfaction," 
Balian said in an interview. "I'm going to make it easy on the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
Balian was convicted last month in a court-martial for failing to give adequate 
aid to the refugees, who were drifting in a junk in the South China Sea last 
June 9 when they encountered the Dubuque, an amphibious transport dock 
commanded by Balian. He ordered that they be given food, water and directions 
to the nearest land, but decided not to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drifted Another 19 Days 
</P>
<P>
The refugees drifted another 19 days after the Dubuque passed them by, and have 
said they resorted to cannibalism when their supplies ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his court-martial ended at the Subic Bay Naval Base in the 
Philippines, Balian said he would remain in the Navy and fight the conviction 
as well as the Navy order relieving him of command of the Dubuque. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said Tuesday that he will continue his legal appeals, but decided to 
leave the Navy because of its insistence that he take a desk job in 
</P>
<P>
Washington, where he was to have become assistant chief of staff for the Naval 
Telecommunications Command. 
</P>
<P>
Balian has been visiting relatives in Los Angeles and was in San Diego on 
Tuesday to consult with his attorneys, Dan Donato and Lt. Cmdr. Ronald 
Petronio, who are preparing his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Balian, who grew up in Los Angeles, had requested that he be transferred to a 
base somewhere in California, but was told there were no jobs available for 
him, he said. After he notified Navy officials that he intends to resign, they 
agreed to assign him to an unspecified job at the Naval Shipyard in Long Beach 
until his resignation takes effect July 31, Balian said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoping for Reversal 
</P>
<P>
He, his wife and two daughters have been living in Sasebo, Japan, where the 
Dubuque is based. He said he wants his daughters, who have reached college age, 
to be able to attend California universities as residents of the state so that 
their tuition will be lower. 
</P>
<P>
"But the ultimate reason why I did it (resigned) is that I'm hoping the appeal 
will reverse this case, but, even if it does, the stigma attached to this 
situation . . . in my mind terminates the potential to excel in this Navy 
career, to advance or get a position of command at sea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Balian, 48, a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, was on the Navy's 
fast track and was a likely candidate for eventual promotion to admiral before 
the refugee incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hung Out to Dry' 
</P>
<P>
In a bitter statement to reporters in the Philippines last month, Balian said 
he had been made a "scapegoat" by the Navy and was "hung out to dry." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy began investigating the incident last summer after the surviving 
refugees were rescued by Philippine fishermen and began telling stories of 
killing and cannibalism that occurred aboard the junk. 
</P>
<P>
About 110 refugees boarded the junk at Ben Tre in southern Vietnam last May 22 
for what they believed would be a four- or five-day trip to Malaysia. But the 
craft's engine failed on the third day out. Only 52 people survived. 
</P>
<P>
Balian argued that, at the time of the encounter, he believed the junk was 
seaworthy and that the supplies he provided would sustain them for the seven 
days it would take them to reach land.

KIWIS SIP FROM VICTORY CUP; 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL COMMUNITY RAISES A FEW STEINLAGERS TO DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayor howled "politics." The yacht club cried foul. The businessmen wrung 
their hands at the $1.2 billion that they may never see. 
</P>
<P>
But a small, delighted contingent of New Zealanders smiled broadly into their 
Steinlagers and spoke of the deep sense of satisfaction that a little justice 
can bring. 
</P>
<P>
In a city of long, disappointed faces, only San Diego's tiny, spirited Kiwi 
community was beaming Tuesday about Judge Carmen Ciparick's decision to forfeit 
the America's Cup to New Zealander Michael Fay. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in fair play," Christchurch, New Zealand native Kay Quick said 
earnestly. "We believe in good competition, an honest competition. And it was 
not that. Unfortunately, (Fay) had to go to court to prove that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hastily Prepared Celebration 
</P>
<P>
Some gathered after work at the offices of the New Zealand Marketing Network on 
Fir Street for a hastily prepared celebration of the legal victory. Nothing 
fancy -- a few Steinlager beers, some champagne, cake and sausage rolls. They 
acknowledged their dismay that the courts, not the seas, had determined the 
winner of yachting's most prestigious prize, the 138-year-old America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
But they wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time of great pride," said Patricia Thornton, president of the network, 
which publicizes and markets upscale New Zealand tourist lodges and several 
other industries. "It's a time to sort of just puff your chest out and say, 
'well done, Kiwis. We did it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Now we get on with what the America's Cup was all about, which is competition 
between sportsmen, not between men with lots of money," said Fiona Barr, a New 
Zealand tourist attending the party. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted. I'm delighted that the decision has gone for New 
</P>
<P>
Zealand. And also I think it restores my confidence in the American system of 
justice," New Zealand native Ian Biggwither, president of Anzam Industries, 
said in a telephone interview from his Escondido office. 
</P>
<P>
The county's tiny Kiwi community -- there are about 300 members of the 
Australia New Zealand America Club and just 50 members of the San Diego New 
Zealand Business Assn. -- was an island in a sea of bitterness about Ciparick's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Sparing no drama, County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, a member of the America's 
Cup Organizing Committee, spoke with anger of what he sees as the decision's 
unfairness to Stars &amp; Stripes Skipper Dennis Conner, who won the Cup off 
Australia in 1987 and vanquished Kiwi Michael Fay's monohull last summer with a 
much faster catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis won this on the crashing seas of the Indian Ocean, and to sit there and 
see it all go for naught in the courtrooms of New York, that must be very 
frustrating to the best sailor in the world," Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Contest of Law' 
</P>
<P>
Port Commission Chairman Louis Wolfsheimer, a powerful development attorney, 
noted that "it seems like this race is no longer a race of who's got the 
swiftest boats, but who's got the best politics and the best lawyers. They've 
turned this into a contest of law." 
</P>
<P>
The business community mourned the loss of $1.2 billion in economic benefits 
that would have come to the regional economy during a 1991 Cup defense. And 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor implied that Ciparick's ruling was tainted by loyalties 
to the New York Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say this decision was politically motivated, but we all know the New 
York Yacht Club wanted the Cup to go to New Zealand so they could compete for 
it on foreign soil in 1991," O'Connor said at an impromptu news conference at 
Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
With an appeal likely, San Diego Yacht Club member Bruce Harmer declared: "I'm 
not brokenhearted about this yet. It's not over until it's over. This is just a 
milestone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Note of Ambivalence 
</P>
<P>
If there was a note of ambivalence from local Kiwis, it was about the missed 
opportunity to host the Cup defense here, and the economic benefits that could 
be lost. 
</P>
<P>
One native New Zealander, Kingsley McLaren, program director at radio station 
KFSD, actually disdained the sport entirely, calling it a contest between 
"rich, spoiled, children playing with a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
But, after nearly a year of hearing people say the Kiwis got what they 
deserved, many of them were content to savor their moment of victory and look 
forward to a Cup defense Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get out and get on the water and have a race," Quick said. "That's what 
we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
Don Patterson also contributed to this report from San Diego.

Oscar time tonight! The suspense! The excitement! The arrests! 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Academy Awards show has served as the backdrop for a 
series of colorful, real-life brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
And, now, the police blotter, please: 
</P>
<P>
1988 -- Gustav Hasford, nominated for an Academy Award for screen writing 
("Full Metal Jacket"), is a no-show after it is disclosed that he's forgotten 
to return 748 library books. 
</P>
<P>
1984 -- KNBC-TV reporter Phil Shuman is thrown to the floor and arrested by 
Beverly Hills police for broadcasting from inside a roped-off area reserved for 
dignitaries at the post-awards Governor's Ball in the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
1983 -- A Polish emigre who won an Academy Award for making the best animated 
short subject winds up in Los Angeles County Jail after kicking a security 
guard and a sheriff's deputy while leaving the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
1981 -- A man in a replica of a California Highway Patrol officer's uniform is 
arrested for trespassing when he sneaks into the ceremonies posing as 
television actor Erik ("CHIPs") Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
1974 -- Artist Robert Opel dashes nude across the Oscar stage. The authorities 
decided not to arrest Opel, but the streaker didn't escape unscathed. Actor 
David Niven, who was about to present an award, watched Opel disappear, then 
quipped that the latter had revealed "his shortcomings." 
</P>
<P>
Sculptor Mario Magro arrived in town the other day, bearing some unusual 
sandwich boards on his roof -- 3-by-7-foot wood bas relief carvings of Ronald 
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Magro, who lives in British Columbia, fashioned the works to honor the former 
President and the Soviet leader for their "work toward achieving world peace." 
</P>
<P>
He wants to send a two-portrait, 200-pound set to each man. But postage being 
what it is, he lacks the funds to send the cargo to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to Los Angeles to raise money because there's lots of money in this 
town," Magro said frankly. 
</P>
<P>
He also wants to give Reagan his set but so far hasn't made contact. 
</P>
<P>
Adventure (?) Island update: 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley will again attempt to preview the Los Angeles Zoo's new 
Adventure Island exhibit this morning. 
</P>
<P>
His previous scheduled appearance there was postponed because it sprinkled. 
</P>
<P>
You figure it: 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls and surveys have variously asserted that, compared to other 
metropolitan regions in the United States, Los Angeles is: 
</P>
<P>
The seventh best place to live. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth most stressful. 
</P>
<P>
The second most health-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
The tenth least relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
The second most romantic (behind San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
The chase, said Inglewood Police Sgt. Bill Thompson, was like something out of 
a stunt-driver truck competition. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents and local police finally nabbed three suspects fleeing an 
alleged drug transaction in a Blazer 4-by-4 Tuesday. But not before the 
big-wheeled truck, cornered at one point, ran up and over the top of an 
unmarked police car. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like you see at the Coliseum!" marveled Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Will Hollywood's trashy movies be on the agenda? 
</P>
<P>
City Council members Ruth Galanter and Marvin Braude are passing up the Oscar 
telecast tonight to meet with Westchester residents to discuss waste disposal.

RTD BUS ERUPTS IN FLAMES NEAR AIRPORT

<P>
An RTD bus with only the driver aboard burst into flames Tuesday morning near 
Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe the fire started as an electrical short in the dashboard and 
spread to the plastic-covered foam seats, which emitted clouds of dark smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The bus had just started its route to Norwalk and the driver escaped uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials said the bus is a total loss and put its value at $148,000.

SCHOOLGIRLS MADE ILL BY CARBON MONOXIDE

<P>
Carbon monoxide from a faulty heating system made 14 sixth-grade schoolgirls 
ill in a cabin at the Cuyamaca Outdoor School at Cuyamaca Rancho State Park 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The students, age 11 to 12, were from Twin Peaks Middle School in Poway, San 
Luis Rey School in the Oceanside School District and Bostonia School in Cajon 
Valley, according to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
There were 49 youngsters and a counselor in the cabin. All were taken first to 
AMI Valley Medical Center in El Cajon and then to Grossmont Hospital.

CONDOR EGG LAID AT PARK PROVES FERTILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another egg laid by captive California condors at the San Diego Wild Animal 
Park has been found to be fertile, a park spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The egg, produced last Thursday by the female AC8 and the male AC5, is the 
first produced by the couple, who were both captured in the wild, according to 
Tom Hanscom. He added that there is a good chance that the female will lay 
another egg in the next 30 days. AC stands for adult condor. 
</P>
<P>
The two are hardly new at parenting. "Both have produced offspring that are 
held in the captive flock," Hanscom said. AC8 has six offspring in captivity, 
AC5 has one. 
</P>
<P>
Six eggs have been laid this year, Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are part of a captive breeding program begun in 1980 to try to 
replenish the nearly extinct species.

WRONG MAN HELD 3 WEEKS AS THE SUSPECT IN A SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attorney for a man who was mistakenly jailed for three weeks in connection 
with a 1982 kiling said Tuesday that his client described the ordeal as a 
"nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Auclair Valdez said his client, Miguel A. Rodriguez, was "shocked when 
it originally happened. It was his worst nightmare. He had never been to San 
Diego. He was just sitting in a car drinking a beer. He was shocked and, on top 
of that, to learn that it was for a homicide was just terrifying." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was arrested by Los Angeles police on March 5 and brought to San 
Diego on an arrest warrant for another man with the same name who was sought in 
connection with the stabbing death of Juan Sandoval Hernandez in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photos Compared 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Barry J. Carlton, said it was determined that Rodriguez was 
not the suspect after witnesses compared a passport photo of the suspect they 
had previously identified with the booking photo of Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"These people, who knew (the suspect) pretty well, still said 'yes, this is 
him, but this other picture is somebody else,' " Carlton said. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked enough alike to me that I couldn't say they were different people. 
They didn't look like twins or anything, but considering the lapse of time, 
they could very well have been the same person. But I didn't want to make an 
immediate judgment on my own. When I got that information, we had no interest 
in keeping an innocent guy in jail," Carlton said. 
</P>
<P>
But Valdez said that because of the time spent in jail, Rodriguez lost his job 
as a construction worker. With a little more effort on the part of authorities, 
they would have found out sooner that they had arrested the wrong man, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"An exit visa from Salvador was granted to Rodriguez in July, 1983," Valdez 
said. The murder of Hernandez took place in August, 1982.

Unfortunately, newspapers are a victim of our "fast-food" society. People lead 
their lives through 12-minute attention spans; I like to call it McLife. We eat 
McFood (dishes ready in under 10 minutes), watch McTV (sitcoms, tabloids, and 
soaps), and receive our McNews through USA Today and 15-second sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
We look for quick solutions and all too often believe the best packaged to be

'MISUSING LOTTERY MONEY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel compelled to respond to your March 8 editorial ("Misusing Lottery 
Money") on how lottery funds are used by schools. In that editorial you quote 
Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig's criticisms of the uses to 
which lottery funds have been put and you close by praising Honig for having 
"finally pointed a finger at a growing problem." My question after reading the 
editorial is at whom is Honig pointing his finger? 
</P>
<P>
Is he pointing at school districts who choose to use lottery funds for "basics 
like salaries and textbooks"? Is he pointing at state officials for 
"substituting lottery earnings for basic support from the state's general 
fund"? Or is he pointing at the California Lottery? 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the California State Lottery Commission and a former 
superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, I know that the 
lottery supplies a small percentage (3%) of the total public education budget 
and that, nevertheless, the funds contributed by the lottery are welcomed by 
our schools., 
</P>
<P>
As you know, the lottery act mandates the lottery "to provide additional monies 
to benefit education without the imposition of additional or increased taxes." 
The act gives schools the prerogative of using lottery funds for any 
instructional purpose, including salaries for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The law further provides that at least 34% of the lottery's annual revenues be 
allocated to public education. In every year since its inception in 1985, the 
lottery has fulfilled this mandate. In fact, in every year the lottery has 
contributed more than the 34% required, because of administrative efficiencies. 
In the last fiscal year, $804 million was transferred to education, which was 
38% of its total revenues. This fiscal year, which ends on June 30, we expect 
our contribution to exceed $950 million, which represents $160 per student. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of Proposition 98 will provide even more funds for schools this 
year and beyond. Fully 40% of the state's future total income will be spent on 
K-12 and community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
As the person responsible for managing the state's educational system, Honig 
should be challenged to provide the leadership to resolve the issue of 
education funding. The task before him is to determine how to make best use of 
all the funding available to educate our children.

NEWSPAPERS AND YOUNG READERS

<TEXT>
<P>
In David Shaw's valuable series on newspapers and youthful readers (Part I, 
March 15, 16), he mentioned two very disturbing phenomena: the decline in the 
number and extent of younger readership and the fact that The Times has 
shortened its articles, possibly in an attempt to make the paper more 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
The latter point confirms my impression that many stories are not as complete 
as they should be. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly urge you to reconsider this policy. A newspaper like The Times 
should be sure to not leave its readers sensing they have been given less than 
a full account. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are for too many events that are "covered" in the Page 2 
briefs. 
</P>
<P>
I think your able staff as well as your readers are being seriously 
short-changed by these attempts to make the paper more appealing. Young people 
and others will read newspapers for their own reasons, more influenced by their 
homes and teachers than any ill-conceived attempts by editors to stylize their 
publications.

As a high school administrator, I have to wonder what type of message we are 
sending to our youth. With the Eastern Airlines strike in full force, I have to 
question where our priorities are when we read about these "tyrannical wages" 
being paid to baggage handlers. Compare their income levels to those in the 
profession of educating the leaders of tomorrow. Furthermore, many of my 
colleagues place their life in jeopardy each day they enter the school grounds. 
What is more important, the care of our bags or the care of our youth? 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I posed a question to my 11th grade history class: What occupation 
would you prefer, that of a high school teacher or an airline baggage handler? 
</P>
<P>
Their overwhelming answer was to be a high school teacher. Then I explained to 
them that the average wage of a baggage handler is (without overtime and bonus) 
$44,000 -- $20,000 more than a teacher's salary. The overwhelming response was 
which way to the airport?

NEWSPAPERS AND YOUNG READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The articles on declining newspaper circulation among young people neglected 
one important point: advertising. The volume and size of advertising in the 
typical American newspaper detracts from its appeal in at least two important 
ways. It's responsible for the sheer, physical cumbersomeness of the medium, 
and it makes it difficult to take the news content seriously, not when the 
articles are spread out over the tops of 3, or 4, or 5 pages. 
</P>
<P>
If newspapers seriously want to enhance their appeal, to young and old readers 
alike, they should adopt a tabloid-size format and confine advertising to its 
own separate sections. The paper may have to accept less in fees for 
"segregated" advertising, but if circulation keeps falling, that's going to 
happen anyway. Sooner or later newspaper publishers are going to have to decide 
whether they're purveyors of news or merely conduits for retail advertising.

A NEW PLAN FOR FOREIGN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A task force of the House Foreign Affairs Committee has proposed repeal of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and enactment of a new International Economic 
Cooperation Act. It is a timely plan that the Bush Administration should heed, 
and promptly. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid had declined in the last four years of the Reagan Administration, 
with most of the resources concentrated on the two primary clients, Israel and 
Egypt, and on military or military-related aid to nations perceived as having 
strategic interest. That leaves relatively little for development in the poor 
nations. The United States now gives less aid, measured as a percentage of the 
gross national product, than at any time in the history of its aid programs, 
and ranks on that scale at the bottom of the list of the industrialized donor 
nations. At the same time, Congress has imposed layer upon layer of regulation 
so that some 700 assorted reports to Congress are required each year, 
frustrating any attempt at flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
The task force itself has urged four priorities: (1) Encouraging broad-based 
economic growth; (2) seeking environmental sustainability through improved 
environmental, natural resource and agricultural management; (3) alleviating 
poverty through human resource development aimed at improving the life of the 
poor and their capacity to become productive citizens, and (4) promoting 
political, social and economic pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Congress would be giving those who administer foreign aid more 
flexibility in development programs geared to clear and realistic objectives, 
while congressional oversight -- instead of the micromanagement of the present 
situation -- would be based on a broad review of results. Earmarking and 
conditionality written into existing law would be eased. 
</P>
<P>
More than organization is at stake. There is a need for a better focus of 
assistance, and there is a desperate need for more money. Rep. Lee H. Hamilton 
(D-Ind.), co-chairman of the task force, pointed to the weaknesses of the 
present program in an address to the Overseas Development Council board in 
Washington last December: "My own view is that our current program suffers from 
too great a concentration on the Middle East, too much emphasis on military 
sales, too many resources going to the bilateral ESF (Economic Support Fund) 
program and not enough to the multilateral institutions, and too great an 
emphasis on immediate political objectives." 
</P>
<P>
The need for change in aid is also reflected in a new study by the Agency for 
International Development, which implements the foreign assistance act. The 
title of the report, "Development and the National Interest," serves to remind 
the nation that foreign aid, while an important test of the traditional 
American generosity, also serves national security goals and has its own rich 
economic reward. 
</P>
<P>
That sense of interdependence is articulated in the House task force report: 
"The United States is and will continue to be affected by development or lack 
of it in other countries. Environmental degradation, deforestation, depletion 
of the ozone layer, trade deficits, drugs, international debt, immigration, 
over-population, AIDS, Mediterranean fruit fly all affect the well-bring of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
The task force report is now in the hands of President Bush and Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III. It provides them with an opportunity to improve the 
effectiveness of American foreign aid, making better use of scarce federal 
dollars at a time of growing need for help.

SCHOOL BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The April 11 election for the Los Angeles Board of Education is a critical one. 
The United Teachers-Los Angeles union is trying to get control of the school 
board. To be sure, teachers should get higher pay, and they should have an 
important voice at all levels of policy-making. But the union's tactics in its 
current contract negotiations with the school board indicate that it does not 
fully understand the school district's financial constraints. UTLA needs to 
work with the board and the administration; instead, it prefers constant 
confrontation. The loss is the students'. Their welfare -- not the union's -- 
should be uppermost in voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
District 2 -- On the Westside, Mark Slavkin, a bright young man and deputy to 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, is opposing Alan Gershman, the 
incumbent, who is a former teacher. Slavkin would bring an energy to the board 
that the low-key Gershman lacks. But, unfortunately, Slavkin's election could 
also give the union that majority it has been trying to get by stalling 
negotiations and targeting Gershman for defeat. Gershman argues that the board 
already faces deep cuts in instructional programs as a result of its current 
salary-and-benefits offer, and that has won him no friends among his former 
UTLA backers. 
</P>
<P>
A two-term member of the school board, Gershman chaired the committee that 
drafted the district's new high school graduation requirements that exceeded 
those required by state law. He has been active in creating the foreign 
languages magnet at Venice High School and the music academy at Hamilton High 
School, as well as adding 11 new elementary music teachers who offer classes to 
students across the city. He also has helped create the Bellagio Newcomers 
School for immigrant students. Gershman is not a flashy board member, but he 
has gotten the job done. He deserves reelection. 
</P>
<P>
District 4 -- Julie Korenstein was elected to the board in 1987 to fill out an 
unexpired term for the West San Fernando Valley seat. Endorsed by the union, 
her reelection will not, however, tip the balance of the board. Korenstein, a 
former substitute teacher in the school district, has supported the 
school-based health clinics, efforts to keep potential dropouts in school and 
volunteer work by students. 
</P>
<P>
 District 6 -- Roberta Weintraub, current school board president, has evolved 
from a one-issue anti-busing candidate into a leavening force in the panel's 
deliberations. As she herself puts it, one of the main things she has learned 
in her 10 years representing the East San Fernando Valley on the board is that 
one must change as the district changes. Some colleagues on previous boards 
didn't; she has. 
</P>
<P>
She has helped get board meetings televised on KLCS-TV, Channel 58, so that the 
public has a better picture of the board, and she is a firm backer of the 
important school-based clinics. She also has worked for promotion of more women 
to administrative jobs in the school system. Of critical importance at this 
point, she has worked hard to communicate to the press and the public the 
district's position and problems during current contract negotiations. 
Weintraub has proved an especially diligent, energetic board member who 
deserves reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The first order of business for the board is to resolve the current contract 
dispute and get on with the big job of improving education for the diverse 
student body in the Los Angeles Unified School District. We think the best 
board members to do that job will be Alan Gershman, Julie Korenstein and 
Roberta Weintraub.

THIS GENERATION GAP IS BUILT ON REAL ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN, Ellen Goodman is a syndicated columnist in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were talking about real estate. It is, to be frank, one of their favorite 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Each of them had a story to tell. One had bought a house in 1973 for $40,000. 
It had just been valued at $265,000. Another had a neighbor who sold her house, 
tripling her money in 10 years -- the right 10 years. A third figured carefully 
the inflated value of his home into his retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
They did not brag, these couples in late middle age, of having had any special 
prescience about a real-estate boom. They had put money down on a house in the 
1960s or '70s and won the jackpot of the '80s. There were no oil wells in their 
back yards, but the homes had made a more spectacular return than any gusher. 
</P>
<P>
They simply rode the real-estate boom to a certain measure of paper profit. The 
houses they chose to live in were also investments to live off. They were now 
middle-income and house-rich. So conversations like these make them feel good 
or at least lucky. 
</P>
<P>
But then the subject turned to their children, grown children. Could their 
children afford to buy the houses they had grown up in? A second set of stories 
poured out, more troubled than the first. 
</P>
<P>
They had working children wholly unable to save a down payment that might equal 
the parents' entire first mortgage. They had married children who needed two 
jobs to afford what they had supported with one. Most of their offspring were 
double-income and house-poor. 
</P>
<P>
To this eavesdropper, there was no news bulletin in this exchange. These days 
the economic gap between generations is built on the private turf of real 
estate. A space has grown between those who have houses and those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
More people over 65 and fewer people under 35 own their own homes these days. 
In 1977, 11.5% of new home-buyers were in their early 20s. In 1987, only 4.2% 
of these buyers were that young. More than one-half of new mortgages depend on 
second incomes. 
</P>
<P>
The gap grew through the vagaries of supply and demand. Over the past 15 years, 
incomes fell behind inflation and houses sped ahead. Tax breaks have gone to 
those with mortgages, and so-called tax revolts made generational differences 
even more striking. In California's famed Proposition 13 froze property taxes 
at 1978 rates -- but only for those who already owned homes. A new neighbor now 
may pay vastly more than the older couple in an identical house next door. 
</P>
<P>
There are other very real effects of real estate on these two generations. 
Generations find common ground in the family. There, the house-rich middle 
class increasingly is called upon to help its house-poor children. 
</P>
<P>
I am told that standard equipment for any mortgage lender's office includes at 
least four chairs: two for the couple and two for the parents who help bankroll 
the sale. As many as half of the first-time young buyers are getting help from 
their parents. If I am to judge by my listening sample, these elders feel both 
duty-bound and willing to share their good fortune. But another of their 
favorite conversations echoes concern about the long-term dependence of "kids 
these days." 
</P>
<P>
The "kids" of 25 and 30 have in turn become awkwardly conscious of the way that 
real estate has solidified the two-class structure. The have and have-nots of 
their own age are often those who either have or have not parents with home 
equity. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to turn a real-estate boom into a sociological bust. The windfall 
is a large component of an older generation's improved economic status. Their 
independence is a boon to their children as well. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also a major reason why the scales are tipping, why grandparents 
often live better than grandchildren. It's why there is a need to build more 
affordable housing, tax more of the capital gains that came to those who rode 
the real-estate boom and allot the money to help families buy into the market. 
</P>
<P>
Rising real estate makes for great conversation. I can attest to that from my 
listening post. But a younger generation is being left out of the lucky 
dialogue. It looks as if the family homestead rests on very shaky ground.

14-YEAR-OLD CHARGED WITH MURDER OF GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newhall teen-ager accused of strangling a 7-year-old girl to death, then 
hiding her body in his bedroom for four days, was charged Tuesday with one 
count of first-degree murder, the Los Angeles district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old, whose identity is being withheld because of his age, is 
scheduled to be arraigned today in Sylmar Juvenile Court, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Michelle R. Rosenblatt. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy has determined that the victim, Sara Nan Hodges, died of 
strangulation, but test results were pending on whether she was sexually 
assaulted, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested late Sunday after the girl's body was found stuffed 
between a wall and the headboard of a water bed in one of two rooms the boy and 
his mother rent in the 24900 block of Alderbrook Drive. Sara, who lived five 
doors away, had been missing since Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's fully clothed body was found by the boy's landlady, who was looking 
for the source of a sickening smell. Authorities said the boy had set up a fan 
in the bedroom to blow the odor out an open window. 
</P>
<P>
Because of juvenile privacy laws, Rosenblatt said she would not discuss reports 
that the boy had committed burglaries in Florida, where he previously lived 
with his father. The boy moved to Newhall in February to stay with his mother, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt said the youth will ultimately face an adjudication hearing before a 
Juvenile Court judge. The hearing is similar to a criminal court trial except 
that a judge instead of a jury decides the defendant's guilt or innocence, 
Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he cannot be tried as an adult, the teen-ager, if convicted, could 
serve time in the California Youth Authority until he is 25. Authorities said 
to be tried as an adult in California, the defendant must be 16 or older.

STUNNED CROWD OF 1,600 BIDS GOODBY TO SLAIN TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,600 people joined in an emotional memorial service Tuesday in North 
Hollywood to honor a longtime Grant High School teacher and senior class 
adviser who was slain in front of his home last week. 
</P>
<P>
Present and past Grant students, many of them friends who had not seen each 
other in years, attended the service at Temple Beth Hillel, embracing and 
exchanging stories about Hal Arthur, who had taught history and government at 
the Van Nuys school since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"Immeasurable is the hurt, and immense, immense is the loss," Rabbi James 
Kaufman said during the service. He said Arthur was the man who in the early 
1960s first encouraged him to become a rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Tuesday that they still had no suspect or motive in the slaying of 
Arthur, 60, who was gunned down Friday morning while leaving his Sherman Oaks 
home for school. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur's longtime friend and colleague, Harlan Barbanell, said students of the 
slain teacher can be found on "every street in this part of the San Fernando 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Grant's 1968 prom queen, Melinda Diner, said she recently had dinner with 
Arthur at a local restaurant "and, my God, people were coming up saying, 'Do 
you remember me, Mr. Arthur?' Everybody knew him. He was like an Ozzie and 
Harriet kind of counselor." 
</P>
<P>
In a hourlong series of eulogies by friends and relatives, Arthur was described 
as an energetic man; a lover of travel, good food and good drink; someone 
passionate about his profession who cared about his students. People filled 
every seat at the temple and stood in the aisles and doorways. Many cried. One 
boy fainted during the service. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the prototype of the good, caring teacher," said Wayne Johnson, 
president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the district's teachers union. Also 
attending were Los Angeles school Supt. Leonard Britton and school board 
President Roberta Weintraub, who represents the East Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Plotkin, Grant's senior class president in 1987, said he grew close to 
Arthur while traveling with him and 30 students during one of the summer trips 
to Europe that Arthur organized. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the best times I've ever had were with him in Europe, drinking 
together in bars and talking like friends," Plotkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin and others interviewed at the service said they still cannot imagine 
who would want to harm Arthur. Those who knew the teacher said they are still 
in shock. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Tolan, Arthur's cousin, said during the service that the killing is 
another example of the need for stricter gun control laws. "There's not enough 
anger being expressed here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur is survived by his wife, Virginia, and three sons, Jason, Michael and 
Jeffery. 
</P>
<P>
Senior class officers at Grant have scheduled a memorial service for Arthur at 
the school at 1 p.m. Thursday. They have also started a Hal Arthur Memorial 
Fund.

OFFICER HIT BY CAR;

POLICE SHOOT SUSPECT IN AUTO THEFT

<P>
An 18-year-old Chatsworth man was shot and wounded when he struck a Los Angeles 
police officer with a stolen car, authorities said Tuesday. The officer was a 
member of a surveillance team that had watched the teen-ager and three other 
youths steal a car. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Galuppo was shot in the left arm about 11:20 p.m. Monday by Detective 
Charles Bennett, 32, in the 10600 block of Variel Avenue. Police said Bennett 
opened fire when Galuppo disregarded an order to surrender, accelerated the car 
and struck the officer with its fender. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett did not require medical care. Galuppo was in stable condition at Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where he was being held in the jail ward on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said two juveniles from Duarte and Rennald Munoz, 19, of Chatsworth were 
arrested on suspicion of auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Surveillance 
</P>
<P>
Detective Bill Holcomb of the Officer Involved Shooting team said the incident 
began when members of the department's Special Investigations Section, or SIS, 
placed the four suspects under surveillance Monday evening. They did so after 
receiving information that the teen-agers were suspected of being involved in a 
series of armed robberies and car thefts in the San Fernando and San Gabriel 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb said there was not enough evidence to arrest the suspects so 
authorities decided to watch them with SIS. The SIS squad became embroiled in 
controversy last year after a report in The Times revealed that the unit 
sometimes watched dangerous criminals commit violent crimes before arresting 
them, and that the unit's arrests resulted in a high number of officer-involved 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, all four suspects were in one car, which police later determined was 
stolen March 16 in Pasadena, Holcomb said. The suspects were followed by 
plainclothes SIS officers from the downtown area to Chatsworth, he said. At 
11:10 p.m., the suspects were watched as they allegedly stole a 1985 Toyota in 
the 19000 block of Nashville Street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drove Away 
</P>
<P>
With three suspects in the other car and Galuppo driving the Toyota, the 
suspects drove away, then parked both cars on nearby Variel Street, Holcomb 
said. The SIS officers then moved in to make arrests. Munoz and the juveniles, 
ages 16 and 17, surrendered without incident, but Galuppo did not, Holcomb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He refused to surrender and attempted to flee the scene," Holcomb said. 
"Galuppo suddenly accelerated and struck Detective Bennett." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett fired four shots at Galuppo, who continued to drive away, Holcomb said. 
The car driven by Galuppo was followed from above by a police helicopter for 
about a mile until it crashed into the rear of an apartment building in the 
9900 block of De Soto Avenue. Holcomb said Galuppo got out of the car and ran 
through the apartment complex but was captured by patrol officers called to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting Monday was the second involving the SIS unit this month. Both 
incidents involved Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
March 14 Incident 
</P>
<P>
On March 14, four SIS officers, including Bennett, fired 14 shots at two 
suspected kidnapers who were trying to escape after allegedly picking up a 
package of ransom money in south Los Angeles, police said. One of the suspects 
was killed and the other escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, police said the kidnap suspects were apparently unarmed, but 
officers defended their action saying that the suspects were believed to have 
weapons. Authorities also said officers believed that if the suspects escaped, 
an abducted woman and her child would be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, after a review of SIS activities prompted by the report in The 
Times, the Police Department issued a new "reverence for human life" policy 
that instructs officers to protect potential crime victims even if it 
jeopardizes an undercover investigation.

ALLEGED GUNMAN DENIES KILLING MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The 17-year-old San Diegan accused of being the triggerman in the possible hate 
slayings of two Mexican farm workers denied the charge Tuesday in Juvenile 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief hearing, Kenneth Kovzelove denied the juvenile petition, or 
complaint, through his court-appointed attorney, James Morse. The denial 
amounts to plea of not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as expected, San Diego County Deputy Dist. Atty. Carlos Armour, 
chief of the juvenile division, moved to try Kovzelove as an adult. The suspect 
turns 18 in July. 
</P>
<P>
Kovzelove, who was arrested last week at Ft. Benning, Ga., where he was in 
training as an Army paratrooper, is expected to contest the motion that he be 
tried in adult court. A hearing on the matter was scheduled for April 14 before 
Juvenile Judge Lawrence Kapiloff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charged as an Adult 
</P>
<P>
The other suspect, Dennis Bencivenga, 19, also of San Diego, is being charged 
in the adult system. Bencivenga, who is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail, 
also has entered a not-guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, citing the heinousness of the crime and Kovzelove's age, have 
expressed confidence that the juvenile judge will permit the suspect to be 
tried in adult court. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding such matters, jurists take into account a wide variety of factors, 
including the severity of the offense and suspects' previous records. 
Authorities would not say whether Kovzelove has had any substantial previous 
run-ins with police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Face Life in Jail 
</P>
<P>
As adults, both Kovzelove and Bencivenga could be sentenced to up to life in 
jail if convicted of first-degree murder. However, Armour noted that state law 
only permits juvenile offenders to be held until age 25. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims -- identified by the coroner's office as Hilario Casteneda 
Salgado, 22, and Matilde Macedo del la Sancha, 19 -- were killed Nov. 9 along 
an isolated stretch of Black Mountain Road in a rural area near San Diego's 
northern boundary. Both are believed to have lived in nearby migrant camps. The 
area is frequented by farm laborers seeking work in nurseries and fields. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, authorities have alleged that Kovzelove positioned himself in 
the bed of Bencivenga's pickup and gunned down the two victims. The weapon used 
was a South Korean-made semiautomatic assault weapon, say San Diego police, who 
have recovered the alleged slaying weapon. The two men were shot 11 times, 
according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have raised the possibility that the slayings may have been 
provoked by the two suspects' hatred for Mexicans. Robbery also was a possible 
motive, police say, although the district attorney's office has said that the 
victims' bullet-riddled bodies were found with more than $300 in cash.

THE LADY WAS A BULLFIGHTER; 
</P>
<P>
10 YEARS IN THE ARENA, 1,000 KILLS, 6 PAINFUL GORINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's a fading memory now. The bellowing crowds, the stirring band music, the 
dust in the nostrils, the half-ton bull charging a swirl of fuchsia cloth, its 
horns low and deadly -- it all so seems distant now, says Patricia McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things come back vividly," said McCormick, 59, an artist who fought bulls 
professionally for 10 years in the 1950s and early 1960s. "But time has made a 
distance." 
</P>
<P>
The gorings stay with her. Six of them. The worst was in 1954, in a Mexican 
border town called Villa Acuna, where she fought a "ding-a-ling" of a bull with 
a nasty right-to-left hook when he charged. "He'd charge the muleta" or cape, 
"then stop and go for you, almost as if he had fought before," said McCormick, 
who was once described by a distinguished bullfighting critic as "the most 
courageous woman I have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
"The horn went right up my stomach," she said, still wincing in memory after 35 
years. "The bull carried me around the ring for a minute, impaled on his horns. 
They gave me the last rites there. The doctor said, 'Carry her across the 
border and let her die in her own country.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saved by Penicillin 
</P>
<P>
Modern drugs and luck saved her. "They said if it had happened before 
penicillin, I would have been dead," she said. "There's an artery that runs 
from the kidney to the bladder, which the horn missed by a fraction of an inch. 
That would have been fatal." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, McCormick leads a very private life in an apartment building on 
Orange Grove Avenue in South Pasadena, where the only immediate danger is the 
possibility that her 19-year-old cat, Hannibal, will knock something off a 
table. The apartment is cluttered with books, art supplies, memorabilia and 
McCormick's sketches of horses in a myriad of poses. 
</P>
<P>
Gray-haired now, a trifle stiff in the joints, McCormick pulls out her capes 
and swords and gives you a quick lesson in the art of bullfighting, which she 
learned under the great Mexican banderillero Alejandro del Hierro. 
</P>
<P>
Holding the muleta, with a sword tucked into its scarlet folds, she waves the 
cape as if challenging a bull. "A lot of people worry about the horn that's 
closest to the body," she said. "But if you reach for the far horn, as if 
you're going to shake hands, the closer horn will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
She demonstrates with a couple of sweeping passes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacation Outing 
</P>
<P>
McCormick, whose father was a petroleum engineer, was 7 when she saw her first 
bullfight on a vacation in Mexico City. "My mother abhorred the spectacle, and 
she rooted for the bull," McCormick said. "I wanted her to throw flowers. It 
had rained that day, and the ground was slippery. I fell in love with a matador 
who lost his shoes in the mud." 
</P>
<P>
Being a bullfighter was just one of her childhood ambitions. "I wanted to be 
Hopalong Cassidy, too," she said. "My greatest ambition was to be an opera 
singer, but I just didn't have the voice." 
</P>
<P>
Her next experience of tauromachy was as a 20-year-old art student at Texas 
Western College in El Paso. She went with a group of students to a bullfight 
across the border in Ciudad Juarez. "It was a windy day and the matadors 
couldn't do much with the bulls," said McCormick, who in 1954 wrote a book 
about her experiences called "Lady Bullfighter." "Nevertheless, it inspired me. 
You could say I became obsessed with bullfighting. It's kind of like being 
stage-struck. To go into that kind of precarious work, there has to be an 
obsession." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacked Money, Contacts 
</P>
<P>
Everyone told her that she couldn't be a bullfighter. "I didn't have the money 
or the contacts," she said. "I was a woman. I didn't have Latin blood, so I 
wouldn't have the temperament for it." 
</P>
<P>
But McCormick persisted. Del Hierro, who is from Ciudad Juarez, finally agreed 
to take her on as a student. "He was very skeptical and I was very shy," she 
said. "But someone introduced him to me and he took me on. I became his 
prodigy." 
</P>
<P>
She killed her first bull in 1951, then turned professional the next year, with 
a series of nine bullfights in Mexican border cities. The tall, blonde Yanqui 
woman, striking in her Andalusian waistcoat and wide-brimmed Spanish hat, soon 
became a popular draw at bullrings from Tijuana to Matamoros. In 10 years as a 
bullfighter, McCormick, who says she was the only American woman ever admitted 
into the bullfighters' union, killed about 1,000 bulls. 
</P>
<P>
McCormick struggles to explain the deep appeal of the art. The cheers of the 
crowd are part of it. "You have a plan to link a series of passes," she said. 
"The bull's first charges are longer, but as he repeats, the charges get 
shorter and shorter and the excitement builds to a crescendo. Ole! But you're 
in control, in perfect control." 
</P>
<P>
But a big part of the appeal, she is certain, has to do with idealism. "I had 
very high ideals," she said. "I loved King Arthur and the Round Table. I saw 
concepts of chivalry in the bullfight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Animal Rights Advocate 
</P>
<P>
For skeptical Americans who deplore bullfighting as cruel and barbaric, it's 
sometimes a difficult position to defend. McCormick considers herself an animal 
rights advocate. "Coon hunts, clubbing baby seals, trapping animals in those 
terrible bear traps -- I'm horrified by things like that," she said. "Believe 
it or not, I don't think I could shoot an animal." 
</P>
<P>
But Spanish fighting bulls are different from other animals. "Fighting is in 
the bulls' blood," McCormick said. "They're bred to keep the fighting strain 
pure. They're like race horses. The family tree is carefully recorded." 
</P>
<P>
Atrocities are sometimes committed in bullfighting, particularly when women 
fight, McCormick acknowledged. Bulls' horns are sometimes shaved, or they are 
fed laxatives to weaken them. "I just deplore anything of that sort," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That's all part of what McCormick sees as a general decline in bullfighting. In 
trying to please a television-bred audience, modern bullfighters have 
substituted "sensationalism" for the "classic style," she said. "And the bulls 
have changed. They're not of the same strength. They don't last the fight. They 
tire very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
In her own career, McCormick insisted on fighting on the same terms as men. 
"For a man to be a serious fighter, he had to fight bulls of a certain size and 
weight, with the horns intact," she said. "I had to fight by the same 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Observed Latin Customs 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, bullfighting was a lonely experience. The bullring is 
predominantly a man's domain, and those who frequent it assume certain macho 
standards of behavior. "I had to be escorted everywhere," McCormick recalled. 
"My escort was usually my sword handler or a member of my manager's family. 
There was no dating or going out with the fellas. I lived as a provincial Latin 
woman, observing all of the Latin customs of the hacienda. On social occasions, 
I sat with the women." 
</P>
<P>
McCormick laughs. "When I came out of bullfighting, it felt like coming out of 
a convent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She left the profession in 1962. There had been managerial problems -- "I never 
saw a lot of the money I earned," she said -- and a nagging problem with 
Mexican tax collectors. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of accolades, McCormick just sort of disappeared. "There was no 
farewell appearance," she said wistfully. She did a stint as an archeologist's 
assistant, then got an office job with the Art Center College of Design in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Category for Me' 
</P>
<P>
But she found herself strangely out of sync with her countrymen. "There was no 
category for me in the United States," she said. "It was all strange to me. I'd 
see people eating from TV trays while watching all this violence on television. 
I'd say, 'How can you eat?' " 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, she quit her job and, living on a trust fund left by her 
mother, began indulging her other obsession: horses. "I had been horse crazy at 
one time in my life," she said, nodding toward her horse sketches. "Now I'm 
making up for lost time." 
</P>
<P>
From all the Sunday afternoons of fighting bulls, she has been left with little 
more than some souvenirs and a store of wisdom. On fear: "You never get over 
it. You learn to live with it." On arrogance: "Humility is better. One little 
bull can make a fool of you." 
</P>
<P>
And finally: "Not every Sunday will be a glorious Sunday." 
</P>

GREEN IS HIT OF THE DAY, BUT FIELDING SKILLS STILL HIS KEY TO PADRE ROSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somebody was looking for Gary Green after his two-hit, two-RBI game here 
Tuesday when a voice arose in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in the back icing his hands," it said. "He's never hit a ball that hard 
in his life." 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres would-be backup shortstop heard that, he would have laughed. And 
then maybe looked for some ice. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Green had said earlier, pointing to Jack Clark. "You looking for the 
slugger, you look over there. If I ever hit a home run, it will be like a big 
deal. It will be like . . . a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
There was no mistaking the effect of Green's two-run single in the sixth 
inning, which helped the Padres to a club-record 17th spring victory, 9-1 over 
the Angels. Two innings later, there was no mistaking that ball he sent 
bouncing to the left-field wall for a double. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also no mistaking that this was still Gary Green, who entered the 
day batting an even .100, with two hits in his entire spring. This was still 
the Gary Green who apparently will make this team because he catches grounders 
better than anyone here, and for no other reason. 
</P>
<P>
Example: In his first at-bat Tuesday, Green fouled off a ball that hit a child 
in the stands. A caring sort, Green was so upset he immediately sent the child 
a bat. But when a Padre official arrived to hand the bat to the boy's father, 
the boy was fine. Green didn't hit it hard enough to hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
Example: Green's two-run hit traveled about 80 feet, looping between first and 
second base, looking less like a single than a golf slice. 
</P>
<P>
"He smoked it," Manager Jack McKeon said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Green said. "Two runs scored, so I'll take 150 of those hits a year." 
</P>
<P>
Example: On Green's two hits, he didn't even use the bats with his name on 
them. He used the bats with Marvell Wynne's name on them. Wynne entered the 
game hitting .385 this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Green, in fact, hasn't been using his bats all spring. "I don't like my bats, I 
like Marvell's bats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fine," Wynne said, "except I saw him even using my bats for batting 
practice, and I almost had a heart attack. I said 'Hold it, big fellow.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think he needs to order some more and get his own name on there." 
</P>
<P>
They can joke all they want, but with Mike Brumley recently traded and new 
acquisition Luis Salazar more of a natural third baseman, Green is a lock to be 
with the club opening night. And with Garry Templeton's temperamental left knee 
-- which Templeton was icing Tuesday even though he didn't play -- Green could 
be used a lot more than as a defensive replacement. 
</P>
<P>
And his bat will have nothing to do with any of that. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came in this organization, Bobby Tolan was my coach at double-A, 
and he told me, 'We just want you to make the plays in the field, you can hit 
.250, .260, we don't care," said Green, a first-round June draft pick in 1984 
from Oklahoma State and the shortstop on the '84 U.S. Olympic baseball team. 
"Since that talk, I have tried to do just that, take care of my fielding. Sure, 
I want to hit .500 or something, but my main concern is the field." 
</P>
<P>
Taking Tolan's advice to heart, Green hit .257 his first season, then .249 at 
triple-A Las Vegas in 1986. At the end of that year, he was called up to the 
Padres and went 7 for 33 (.212). The next two seasons, he hit .237 and .272 in 
Las Vegas. In his four-year pro career, in 1,498 at-bats, he has two homers. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I figure it, anything I do at the plate is a plus," Green said. "I'm 
here to play good infield and make all the plays and just do whatever I can at 
the plate. Maybe bunt the guy over, or make contact to get a guy over, or 
whatever." 
</P>
<P>
It has always been McKeon's contention that Templeton can hit .230 and still be 
an important part of the starting lineup -- "As long as we have guys around him 
who can hit," McKeon said. "You don't always need those big numbers from your 
shortstop." 
</P>
<P>
He feels the same about Green, only more so. 
</P>
<P>
"If he stays, he's here for defense, for late innings," McKeon said. "That's 
his role, and while we'd like to see him get a few hits, defense is is the main 
thing we'd ask." 
</P>
<P>
Green, infielder/outfielder Bip Roberts and first baseman Rob Nelson are 
officially in contention for the final two roster spots. It appears those spots 
will go to Green and Roberts, the latter because of his versatility. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were hit with a bit of reality when Don Fehr, executive director of 
the Players Assn., met with them and the Angels concerning the impending 1990 
labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In this, the last stop of Fehr's league-wide tour, the teams heard of the 
owners' threat to lock the players out of camp next spring following the Dec. 
31, 1989, expiration of the current basic agreement. They heard about the 
issues likely to separate the two parties, things such as free agency, salary 
cap and arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after the three-hour chat, as if to enforce the seriousness of the 
matter, players who played all of last season in the big leagues were given 
annual Major League Baseball Licensing revenue checks containing $5,000, or 
$27,000 less than usual. 
</P>
<P>
That is because from every check, given to the players as their cut of 
everything sold that is licensed by Major League Baseball (caps, shirts, etc.), 
$27,000 is being withheld for a strike year war chest. 
</P>
<P>
"What is comes down to is: If there isn't the threat of a lockout or strike, we 
get $32,000 today," one Padre said. "But we get $5,000. That brings home the 
seriousness of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
Players who have been in the league each of the years from 1986-89 would stand 
to earn about $70,000 in strike pay from the Players Assn., which Fehr said 
might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is an owners' lockout or we are pushed to a strike, it could last a 
long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Players Assn. will not make any contract demands until they see 
the nature of the free-agent market and salary structures as dictated by the 
owners next winter, the owners have already talked about revenue sharing and a 
salary cap, both of which the players would oppose. 
</P>
<P>
For those who think the thought of a lockout or strike will get the Padres 
down, not to worry. "Not that we won't be eventually worried, but first things 
first," said pitcher Dennis Rasmussen, the Padres' player representative. 
"We've got a long season to think about. Right now, this is on the back 
burner." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bill Adams, who just last July was named Padre director of ticket sales and 
operations, has been named to replace Dick Freeman as executive vice president. 
It was a move not completely unexpected, since Adams was hired last summer away 
from a high-powered spot as president of Coca-Cola's Los Angeles operation. 
Adams will control the club's ticketing, broadcasting, finance, marketing and 
stadium operations. In other words, he's one of a growing breed of baseball 
executives who don't have much to do with baseball. . . . After Tuesday's 9-1 
victory over the Angels, third baseman Randy Ready was icing a sore right 
shoulder. . . . Not only is reliever Mark Davis having a great spring on the 
mound -- he pitched another shutout inning Tuesday as his ERA dropped to 0.53 
-- he's having an unbelievable spring on the links. At the Palm Springs 
Municipal Golf Course Monday afternoon, Davis had his second hole-in-one in the 
past two months. This time he used a seven-iron on a 165-yard hole. "We 
high-fived for five minutes," said Mike Swanson, the Padre assistant director 
for media relations and Davis' witness. Davis also had a hole-in-one just 
before the start of spring training at a Scottsdale, Ariz., course.

<P>
In another baseball game: 
</P>
<P>
Mission 17, L.A. City 5 -- Shawn Fontenot was three for four with four runs 
batted in and hit a two-run home run in the third inning to lead Mission in a 
Southern California Athletic Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Mission pitcher Jose Garcia had a shutout going into the sixth inning but tired 
and gave up five earned runs before being replaced. Mission (6-14, 4-4 in 
conference play) moved into third place.

<P>
MEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark 7, Pierce 2 -- Since the spring of 1976 there have been as many 
presidential elections -- four -- as there have been Western State Conference 
losses for Pierce. But Moorpark was not intimidated in the WSC match at 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Darrin Pleasant led the upset, defeating Sang Kim, the defending conference 
champion, 7-6, 6-4, in No. 1 singles and teaming with Mike Studebaker to defeat 
Kim and Mark Nielsen, 6-4, 6-4, in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce (9-1) came into the match ranked third in the state. The Brahmas have 
won or shared every conference championship since 1976, and fell into a 
first-place tie with Santa Barbara with an 8-1 WSC record. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, which lost only two singles matches, improved its conference record 
to 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>

THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
STROH REMAINS CALM ABOUT A SLOW START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darryl Stroh's blood pressure is down, perhaps because expectations are, too. 
</P>
<P>
His Granada Hills baseball team is 0-5, but Stroh says that there have been 
more than a few high points. It's just that most haven't been during games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm enjoying everything but losing," Stroh said. "I've had teams that won that 
have been more stressful than this one." 
</P>
<P>
Stroh said the current group of Highlanders are overachievers, and that living 
up to the school's storied baseball history has been more of a hardship for the 
players than its coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tougher on the kids than me," he said. "They're the first ones in a 
while that have had this kind of struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Applying appliances: Westlake Coach Rich Herrera kept track of Simi Valley's 
offensive assault on the Serra tournament, where the Pioneers scored 48 runs in 
four games last week, and has come up with a plan to slow them down in today's 
Marmonte League game. 
</P>
<P>
First, he will pitch staff ace Mike Eby, who will be working on seven days' 
rest. But, just in case, Herrera has a backup plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bringing the kitchen sink, the kitchen table, we're bringing everything 
on the bus . . .," he said. "The way they're hitting the ball, I may have to 
get out there." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, not such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera was a combined 16-4 for Rio Mesa in 1981 and 1982, when the Spartans 
won the Southern Section 1-A Division title and were runners-up, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the kitchen sink," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitch and run: Kevin Foderaro struck out nine and scattered four hits as Hart 
beat Boulder City, Nev., 10-3, in the third game of the Chaparral tournament 
last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad, especially for a guy who was promoted from the junior varsity to spell 
the Indians' staff, which is without injured ace Jason Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Foderaro probably will return to the JV. 
</P>
<P>
"Foderaro would have to sit too much on the varsity," Coach Bud Murray said. 
"It will depend on what happens to Jason." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who has been bothered by an inflamed rotator cuff, said he should be 
throwing in a week. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for the memories, Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
In a slump: El Camino Real first baseman Ryan McGuire was selected state 
sophomore player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports last season after batting .397 
with 14 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, McGuire, as the barb goes, isn't hitting his weight. He has just 
one hit in 10 at-bats, but has drawn six walks. 
</P>
<P>
Seen any strikes lately, Ryan? 
</P>
<P>
"When I do see 'em, I'm not doing much with them," he said. "I've always been a 
pretty selective hitter. I'm just not hitting the ball very well." 
</P>
<P>
Add El Camino Real: With his pitching staff taking a beating, Coach Mike Maio 
has moved McGuire, a left-hander, into the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire has eight strikeouts and a 3.50 earned-run average in four relief 
innings. He has fared markedly better than starters Patrick Treend (0-2, 10.76 
ERA) and Steve Smith (0-1, 15.40 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
Said Maio: "In this conference, everybody's the team to beat, except us." 
</P>

MADISON'S 7-RUN INNING IS DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It can seem the biggest word in the English language -- the "if" word. 
</P>
<P>
In Madison's 8-0 softball victory over Orange Glen Tuesday afternoon, it could 
have gone something like this: If the fourth inning hadn't happened, Orange 
Glen would have taken a less painful 1-0 nonleague loss along on the long ride 
back to Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"One bad inning, that's all we had," Orange Glen Coach Lynne Kelley told her 
players after the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots (3-5) were looking at a scoreless game, and Orange Glen freshman 
Lara Campbell had pitched three innings and given up just one hit, when 
Madison's Natalie Hurlburt hit an infield single to start a seven-run, 
seven-hit fourth inning. Kim Lester followed with a single to center, with both 
runners advancing on the center fielder's throw. Jenifer Booker drove in 
Hurlburt and Lester with a double to left, giving the Warhawks a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Madison continued when Michelle Sergott reached first on an error, scoring 
Booker from second. Patti Howell singled to right, moving Sergott to second, 
and Lini Koria took first on a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Vanegas hit an infield single to load the bases, and pinch-hitter Dawn 
Sanphy walked to score Sergott and make it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Warhawks had the momentum going their way; Orange Glen was getting anxious 
and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's normal and human," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
With just two seniors returning -- center fielder Annie Page and catcher 
Jennifer Tubbs -- and a young infield, Kelly said it will take time for the 
inexperienceto wear off. 
</P>
<P>
"They have lots of growing to do," Kelly said. "They get in a game like this, 
and it's the first time they've seen many of the things that happened today. 
They aren't seasoned yet." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell struck out Suzanne Galletta for the second out of the fourth, but 
Hurlburt then doubled, scoring Koria and Vanegas and moving Sanphy to third. 
Lester singled to score Sanphy for the final run of the inning as Hurlburt was 
called out at the plate for running into Tubbs. 
</P>
<P>
Madison's Hurlburt, Booker and Jennifer Hamme all pitched, with Booker (4-1) 
picking up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only playing once this week," Madison Coach Steve Miner said, "and I 
wanted to give them all some work." 
</P>
<P>
Sergott scored Madison's final run in the fifth on an Orange Glen error. 
</P>
<P>
Madison went 28-2 last year and was runner-up to Fallbrook in the San Diego 
Section 3-A final. They are 9-2, with a one-run loss to Monte Vista and a 3-1 
loss to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said she'd be surprised not to see the Warhawks in the section final 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find a weakness on them," she said. "If I was a bettor, I'd put 
my money on them." 
</P>
<P>
In other nonleague softball games: 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, Montgomery 0 -- Elena Castro (4-0) pitched a one-hitter for San 
Diego (4-0). Stacey Baird was three for three with two singles, a triple and an 
RBI, and Delia Burke hit a double for the Cavers. Montgomery is 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay 12, Hoover 0 -- Tiffany Wasilewski (1-2) pitched a one-hitter. 
Bridget Cota hit two-run home run in the second for Mission Bay (2-3) and was 
two for three with three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball 
</P>
<P>
Nonleague 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines 7, Carlsbad 0 -- John Lynch allowed only two batters to reach base 
-- one on a hit, another on a walk -- while striking out eight for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch (1-2) threw only 84 pitches in the seven-inning game. He also scored two 
runs despite getting no hits. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff hitter Jason Wright was two for four with an RBI and a stolen base, and 
Preston Bynes was two for three with an RBI, a double (the only extra-base hit 
of the game) and a stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
University of San Diego High 10, St. Augustine 5 -- The teams combined to use 
11 pitchers in the seven-inning game. Jeff DesJardins went three for four with 
a home run and three RBIs for USDHS (8-2). 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook 9, El Camino 6 -- The Warriors improved to 8-2 while hitting a 
section-record-tying four triples. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Pearson, Mike Gainsborough, Dan Siegler and Aaron Hopkins combined to tie 
the record set by Bonita Vista vs. Marian and tied by San Pasqual vs. Francis 
Parker in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's Ricky Spears hit the game's only home run. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen 3, Chula Vista 2 -- David Silva scored Matt Taylor from first with 
a single in the bottom of the seventh. Jim Roby picked up the victory in relief 
for Orange Glen (5-6). KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

GEORGE BENSON LEADS PACK FOR HUMPHREY'S CONCERTS

What will be the most successful bookings, attendance-wise, in this year's 
eighth annual Concerts by the Bay series at Humphrey's on Shelter Island? Last 
Saturday, tickets went on sale for the 1989 season's preliminary lineup of 35 
dates. Judging from first-day ticket sales, the big winner is likely to be 
George Benson. 
</P>
<P>
Benson's Sept. 19 and 20 appearances at the 1,000-seat outdoor facility are 
nearly six months away. But, by the time the box office closed Saturday, more 
than 500 tickets had been sold to the pop-jazz superstar's four-show, two-night 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the top five box-office draws as of Saturday night, according to 
promoter Kenny Weissberg, are, in descending order, jazz fusionists Hiroshima, 
June 7 and 8; Motown greats the Four Tops, May 19; calypso king Harry 
Belafonte, July 6, and Ray Charles, the legendary "father of soul," June 9. 
More than 300 tickets to each of these shows had been sold by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these concerts look like they're going to be sellouts," Weissberg said, 
adding that total first-day ticket sales are up 28% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only did we go on sale with more acts than we did in 1988, we've got a 
stronger lineup, with a lot more big names." 
</P>
<P>
So much for the winners. What about the losers? 
</P>
<P>
According to Weissberg, the bottom five box-office draws as of Saturday night, 
again, in descending order, are rock balladeer Gene Pitney, June 23; late-1950s 
doo-wopper Little Anthony and early-'60s heartache queen Lesley Gore, July 30; 
gospel singer Al Green, Aug. 27; jazz saxophonist Ronnie Laws and his brother 
flutist Hubert Laws, June 29, and the O'Jays, one of the most popular black 
vocal groups of the pre-disco '70s, July 9. First-day ticket sales to each of 
these shows were less than 75; in the case of the O'Jays, the final count was a 
dismal 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the concerts that aren't doing well are by oldies acts," Weissberg 
said. "But, in the past, the six or seven oldies shows we've done each season 
have had the highest average attendance, so I'm still holding out hope -- and 
waiting for Eagle 105, oldies radio station KCBQ-AM/FM (1170/105.3), which is 
presenting these shows, to launch their traditionally aggressive promotional 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
The eighth annual Concerts by the Bay series opens May 12 with two shows by 
soul singer Natalie Cole. Other confirmed dates, aside from the ones already 
mentioned, are appearances by pop-jazz group Spyro Gyra, June 15 and 16; jazz 
saxophonist Grover Washington Jr., June 18; guitar ace Chet Atkins and British 
New Age guitar duo Acoustic Alchemy, June 22; pop-jazz guitarist Earl Klugh, 
June 25 and 26; mid-'60s bubble-gummers the Monkees, July 7, and acoustic 
guitarists Leo Kottke and Michael Hedges, July 14. 
</P>
<P>
Also on tap: a cappella vocal group the Nylons, July 16; folkies Judy Collins 
and Al Stewart, July 20; pop-jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour, July 21; Latin-rock 
troupe Sergio Mendes and Brasil '89, July 23; keyboard player David Benoit, 
July 28; comedian Gallagher, Aug. 3 and 4, and Jacuzzi-jazz fluegelhorn player 
Chuck Mangione, Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the list of confirmed bookings at Humphrey's this season are soul 
singer Lou Rawls, Aug. 9; B. B. King, Aug. 11; hot new country 
singer-songwriter Lyle Lovett, Aug. 17; jazz vocalist Diane Schuur, Aug. 18; 
country-rock group the Desert Rose Band, led by ex-Byrd Chris Hillman, Sept. 
14, and jazz stalwarts the Dave Brubeck Quartet, Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets to these shows, Weissberg said, are selling well, with first-day sales 
between 100 and 250. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, tickets go on sale for three newly announced additions to the 1989 
Concerts by the Bay series: country legend Johnny Cash, July 19; comedians Emo 
Philips and Judy Tenuta, July 27, and country hotshot Ricky Skaggs, Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: First, there was Beatlemania and any number of Elvis Presley 
impersonators. Now there's Wild Child -- led by Jim Morrison look-alike Dave 
Brock -- and Randy Hansen, presenting musical salutes to, respectively, the 
Doors and Jimi Hendrix. The two clone acts will be appearing Thursday night at 
the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach. . . . New additions to the Del Mar Fair's 
1989 grandstand concert lineup: Motown veteran Smokey Robinson, June 21, and 
pop crooner Tony Bennett, June 22. . . . Folk-rock singer-songwriter Steve 
Forbert has been tapped to open for Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians May 24 
at Symphony Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale today for roots rockers the Dead Milkmen's April 27 
appearance at the Soma 555 dance club downtown. On Friday, tickets go on sale 
for four more San Diego concerts: ex-Ultravox lead singer Lou Reed, April 21 at 
the California Theater downtown; Midge Ure, April 28 at the Spreckels Theater, 
also downtown; rock upstarts the Replacements, May 4 at the California Theater, 
and reggae bands Third World and the Wailers, May 21 at the Starlight Bowl in 
Balboa Park. And, on Saturday, tickets go on sale for hard rock heavyweights 
Bon Jovi's April 21 show at the San Diego Sports Arena. . . . Four months after 
they played Golden Hall to a near-capacity crowd, blues revivalists the Robert 
Cray Band will be back in San Diego on May 19, this time at the Starlight Bowl. 
Tickets go on sale April 7.

Kevin Kenner, a 26-year-old pianist from Coronado, will be one of 40 
competitors performing in the Van Cliburn International Competition May 27-June 
11 in Ft. Worth, Tex. More than 200 pianists auditioned in 17 cities around the 
world to reach this level in the prestigious competition, held once every four 
years. Angela Cholakyan of Los Angeles was the only other competitor from 
Southern California to reach this level. In 1987, Kenner was a grand prize 
winner in the New York Chopin Competition.

Organizers of the Soviet arts festival announced Tuesday the inclusion of a 
movie festival and symposium featuring four Georgian film directors, the 
addition of three more eggs to the exhibit of Faberge eggs, and the creation of 
extensive festival-related educational programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
Arrangements were also solidified for the B St. Pier exhibition of 30 Georgian 
icon masterpieces from the Fine Arts Museum of Georgia and for performances by 
the Georgian State Folk Song and Dance Company and a children's folk dance 
group, the organizers said. An agreement was also reached to bring a Georgian 
mural artists to San Diego to paint a tribute to the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"This visit was very productive in clarifying a number of details and in 
initiating the educational component," said Sal Giametta, cultural aid to Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor. "The educational component is one of the most important. The 
plan is to involve San Diego-area children in the festival to the fullest 
extent." 
</P>
<P>
Giametta returned recently from a 10-day trip to the Soviet Union with a 
delegation representing the "San Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet 
Union." Other delegates were festival artistic coordinator Bruce Joseph, Hal 
Fischer of the Timken Art Gallery, festival education committee chairwoman Jess 
Flemion and San Diego Opera general director Ian Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Flemion took letters and mementoes to Georgian students from 24 San Diego 
schools that are participating in "Young at 'Art," an innovative visual arts 
training program. Flemion will be developing "curriculum packets" in social 
studies and current affairs on Soviet Georgia for local elementary and 
secondary-school classes, Giametta said. "It's the first leg of a 
children-to-children component of the festival that will become more and more 
important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Georgian film directors and a Georgian film critic will participate in a 
cinema festival and symposium. The directors will be recommended by Eldar 
Shegelaja, cinema director of the Georgian Cinematographic Union, Giametta 
said. Either the Museum of Photographic Arts or the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art or both will sponsor the festival locally.

BUSH SENDS TOP AIDES TO ASSESS SPILL DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Bush Tuesday dispatched three top officials to Alaska to assess the 
massive oil spill there as political controversy began to escalate over 
Administration plans to expand oil drilling in an environmentally sensitive 
part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Bush summoned Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, Environmental 
Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost 
to the Oval Office for an early morning meeting before sending them to Alaska 
to "take a hard look at where this disaster stands." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said after the session that he had received "conflicting reports" on the 
progress that Exxon Corp. had made in containing the spill. "I don't want to 
prejudge that," he said, asking the top-level team to report back to him on 
what additional steps may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Those steps could include federal civil penalties against Exxon, Skinner said. 
The Coast Guard, which is leading federal efforts to combat the spill, will be 
responsible for deciding whether Exxon violated federal regulations in its 
operation of the oil tanker that struck a reef and ruptured, causing the huge 
oil slick. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said that Justice Department lawyers also 
will monitor the situation. 
</P>
<P>
With Exxon officials now admitting that the cleanup so far has gone poorly, 
Bush said that a federal takeover of the effort is "an option" that Skinner, 
Reilly and Yost would assess. Under that approach, which Administration 
officials currently consider unlikely, the government would pay for the cleanup 
and then seek reimbursement from the company. Federal disaster relief officials 
Tuesday also were reviewing a request from Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper for 
additional federal emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attention generated by the scope of the spill -- the largest in 
U.S. history and one of the worst ever -- Bush said he felt no need to review 
his Administration's plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil 
drilling. "I see no connection" between drilling in the reserve and the 
contamination in Prince William Sound, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, however, who have been battling the drilling plan for 
several years, lost no time in making a connection. Opening up the wildlife 
reserve to drilling, they stressed, would greatly increase oil shipping along 
the tanker route from the port of Valdez through Prince William Sound, the 
formerly pristine waterway fouled by about 10 million gallons of oil since the 
Exxon Valdez accident Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The oil spill is a "giant alarm clock" that should awaken the nation to the 
environmental dangers that inevitably accompany major oil drilling programs, 
the "Group of 10" major environmental organizations said in a statement. Bush's 
plan for "environmentally prudent" drilling in the wildlife reserve is a 
contradiction in terms, they said, and they asked for a new study to be made of 
the full environmental impact of drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"We find no independent scientists who say you can develop the Arctic coastal 
plain in an environmentally prudent way," said former Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord 
Nelson, who now heads the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental groups called on Bush to ask the National Academy of Sciences 
to conduct the new impact study, noting that Bush already has ordered such a 
review of drilling off two sections of the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Although Administration officials argue that the oil from the wildlife area is 
needed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports, environmental 
advocates argue that energy conservation measures, such as increasing the fuel 
efficiency of new cars, could have the same impact. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have made a long series of objections to drilling in the 
reserve, which is the principal calving area for 180,000 migratory caribou and 
a breeding ground for 300,000 geese and millions of shore birds. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the risk of further tanker accidents, they charge that noise and 
exploration activity could disrupt wildlife and toxic drilling muds and other 
wastes could seriously pollute the areas around the wells. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how many precautions are taken, the unthinkable can still happen," 
said Lisa Speer, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
"The only way to keep the unthinkable from happening in environmentally 
sensitive areas is to keep oil development out." 
</P>
<P>
While arguments escalated about future policy, Administration officials 
continued to try to sort out an appropriate government response to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that the review team is not likely to recommend a 
federal takeover, preferring the current system in which Exxon is directly 
paying the costs of removing the oil from the waters and shores of Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The company has said that it would cover the full cost of the cleanup, but an 
Exxon spokesman Tuesday indicated that the company probably would seek 
reimbursement from a special industry fund to cover at least some of its costs. 
Under the legislation that first set up the Alaska pipeline system a decade 
ago, each of the seven oil companies drilling in Alaska agreed to pay up to $14 
million for any cleanup costs. In addition, the companies agreed to set up a 
fund to cover up to an additional $86 million in damages for any oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
If cleanup costs and damages exceed $100 million, however, extensive litigation 
to establish company negligence might be necessary to obtain more money. In 
1978, for example, the Amoco Cadiz, a supertanker owned by Amoco Corp., went 
aground on the coast of France during a gale, creating a spill six times larger 
than the current Alaska spill. The final damages in that case, about $117 
million, were only established last month by a federal judge in Chicago who has 
continued to preside over the case despite having retired in the years it has 
dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
In part because of that problem, Transportation Department officials said 
Tuesday that a government takeover of the clean-up effort would occur only if 
Exxon appears unable to handle the task. The federal government would not be 
eager to pay the bill until the matter was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment it seems both unwise and unlikely, unless something happens that 
changes our mind," a senior Transportation Department official said.

REALIGNMENT SEEN FOR SOVIET PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR SPOKESMAN EXPECTS SHAKE-UP IN WAKE OF TOP OFFICIALS' BALLOT LOSSES

<P>
A major realignment within the Soviet Communist Party appears likely to follow 
the defeat of perhaps a quarter of the party's nominees, many of them among the 
country's most powerful officials, in the nation's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
As more defeats of regional and local party leaders were reported Tuesday, a 
senior Soviet official said the party will have to review the positions of 
those leaders whose candidacies to the new Congress of People's Deputies were 
rejected in the weekend elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The party must decide why it happened," Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign 
Ministry's chief spokesman, said of the huge protest vote. "We will have to 
examine this promptly and thoroughly. Party leaders must have not only the 
confidence of the party, but the confidence of the people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's Warning 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had warned a special party conference last 
summer that "the party's authority will be put to a serious test" by the 
contested elections envisioned in his political reforms. But he declared that 
party leaders nonetheless had to be made "more effectively answerable to the 
working people" if the country's broad strategy of political, economic and 
social change are to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
When its nominees were defeated, Gorbachev added, the party "will have to draw 
the necessary conclusions" -- and he may now use such a wide-ranging review to 
purge more conservative officials from the party's senior ranks on grounds that 
they have lost the faith of the people. 
</P>
<P>
The list of those defeated now includes the top three party and city officials 
in Leningrad, five regional party secretaries in the Ukraine, the mayors of 
Moscow and Kiev, many senior party and government officials in the Baltic 
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, several military and naval 
commanders and regional party leaders from the Soviet Far East across Siberia 
and Russia to Byelorussia. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent loser was Yuri F. Solovev, first secretary of the Leningrad 
regional party committee and a candidate, or nonvoting, member of the ruling 
Politburo. Although running unopposed in his home district, he failed to win a 
majority of the votes cast as a reported 60% of those who went to the polls 
scratched his name off their ballots. Under Soviet law, a candidate must 
receive at least half of the votes cast to be elected even if unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
But many other regional first secretaries, powerful political barons in the 
party structure, were similarly defeated in grass-roots campaigns that 
galvanized the long-simmering popular discontent into an unprecedented protest 
vote that defied the party machine and broke decades of enforced discipline. 
</P>
<P>
The party's power was not seriously at stake. The candidates were competing for 
1,500 seats in the new Congress of People's Deputies and subsequent election to 
the Supreme Soviet, the strengthened national Parliament. Party control of both 
is assured at this point because of the predominance of Communists among the 
candidates and the selection of 750 additional deputies from a variety of 
groups, including the party, the Communist Youth League, the trade union 
federation and other allied groups. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some senior party leaders who won election found that their authority had 
nevertheless been diminished significantly by the heavy popular vote against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, the party leader in the Ukraine and the most senior 
member of the Politburo, was elected as a deputy from the industrial city of 
Dnepropetrovsk, but only after 63,000 people, more than a quarter of the 
electorate in the carefully selected district, struck his name from their 
ballots. Several of his top assistants were defeated in their election bids. 
</P>
<P>
Were it not for the 100 seats reserved for party representatives in the 
congress, some other leaders might have been defeated even running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev, regarded as the leader of party conservatives within in the 
Politburo, drew the largest number of negative votes, about 12% of those cast, 
within the party's relatively conservative Central Committee, and his prospects 
in open elections were acknowledged as uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also was elected as a party representative, but drew only 12 negative 
votes out of the 641 cast by Central Committee members and other senior 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although full results are not yet available, informed Soviet sources said that 
at least 20% and perhaps more than 25% of the party's nominees -- candidates 
put forward by party groups and receiving at least unofficial party support -- 
were defeated, and most of these were party officials. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, about 82% of the 2,895 candidates in the election were party 
members, but most were running independently -- or in virtual opposition to 
party policies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Anger' Seen 
</P>
<P>
"We had no idea of the depth of the popular discontent," a senior Soviet 
journalist who reports on party affairs said Tuesday. "There is real anger 
among the people, and it is focused on the party and precisely on the party's 
leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the party's Central Committee headquarters have already begun a 
detailed, district-by-district examination of the party's losses and 
near-losses, according to informed Soviet sources, and the Politburo is 
expected to discuss the results, at least informally, at its regular weekly 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the shock wears off, there will probably be two reactions," an editor at 
a party journal commented. "Some people will blame those who proposed the 
elections, starting with Gorbachev. Wiser heads, however, will start examining 
who was defeated and why and then putting forward ideas to remedy the party's 
clear alienation from the people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"A first step on this course will be to remove those who do not enjoy the 
confidence of the people from positions of leadership. Purge is too harsh a 
word, but we should at least have a thorough house-cleaning this spring." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Gerasimov said that, in the case of a city party leader who had been 
defeated, "I could imagine that a session of the city party will discuss this 
and then take the corresponding decision." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "But you should not see any automatic mechanism in this. Each case 
will be considered separately." 
</P>
<P>
Protest of a different kind was registered in Yerevan, the capital of troubled 
Soviet Armenia, where nationalists organized a boycott of the election, 
according to the government newspaper Izvestia. Turnout in Yerevan was only 
53%, according to election officials, compared to 72% in all of Armenia and 
about 85% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The party has a chance to recover some of its lost prestige next month with a 
full-scale effort to win the 100 contests to be decided in runoff elections on 
April 9 between the two top vote-getters in multi-candidate contests where no 
one received the required 50% of the vote on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, new elections will be held for a further 100 seats where neither 
of two candidates received half of the votes cast because of popular opposition 
to both of them.

JUDGE WRESTS AMERICA'S CUP FROM SAN DIEGO

<P>
In an unprecedented ruling, a judge Tuesday said that Dennis Conner and the San 
Diego Yacht Club, in winning the America's Cup sailing race last year, violated 
the spirit of fair competition called for in the rules. The judge stripped the 
San Diego club of the trophy and awarded it to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
New York Supreme Court Judge Carmen Ciparick decided that by racing a two-hull 
catamaran against a mono-hull craft in September, San Diego had created a 
"gross mismatch" contrary to the intention of the author of the 19th-Century 
Deed of Gift governing the race. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the New York court, which has jurisdiction over interpretation 
of cup rules, was a shocking blow to the sailing community and to the city of 
San Diego, which was expecting a $1-billion bonanza in hosting the next race in 
1991. After the ruling, New Zealand officials announced plans to the hold the 
race there. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the San Diego Yacht Club and the America's Cup Organizing 
Committee criticized the judge for what one of them called a legal "flip flop." 
The lawyer representing the yacht club said bluntly: "We've been had." 
</P>
<P>
A final decision on a possible appeal probably will not be made until today at 
the earliest. The officials said they had to analyze the 14-page ruling, and 
that they would be guided by "what is best for the America's Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the moment skipper Dennis Conner won the cup in races off the coast 
of Fremantle, Australia, in February, 1987, the cup has been under siege. First 
there was a controversy over where the next regatta would be held -- San Diego 
or Hawaii -- in what amounted to a bidding war, and then merchant banker 
Michael Fay of New Zealand issued an unusual one-on-one challenge. This sent 
the contest, once determined by sailors at sea, into the hands of lawyers in 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Fay's challenge, which called for him to race off the coast of San Diego in a 
$10-million 123-foot mono-hull, was upheld by the New York court in November, 
1987, touching off a decision by the San Diego Yacht Club and the Sail America 
Foundation to "dispose" of Fay's maverick challenge as quickly and efficiently 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catamaran Chosen 
</P>
<P>
Conner and the yacht club selected a 60-foot catamaran, a boat clearly superior 
in speed to Fay's mono-hull. No catamaran had ever raced for the cup, and the 
San Diegans defended their unusual choice -- which was criticized by many in 
the yachting world for being unsportsmanlike -- as legal under the cup's rules 
embodied in the 1887 Deed of Gift. 
</P>
<P>
Last September off Pt. Loma, the two vessels raced in a best-of-three match 
series. The result was a blowout for Conner, who won the first two races by 
wide margins. The loss sent Fay back to court. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Judge Ciparick sharply criticized the San Diego club for selecting 
a catamaran, and said the club fell short of its responsibility as a trustee of 
the cup. Acknowledging that forfeiture is an extreme remedy, the judge said she 
had no choice but to turn over the cup to Fay and his Mercury Bay Boating Club 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego was well aware of the risk it ran when it chose to follow the 
unprecedented course of defending in a catamaran," the judge said. "Barely 
paying lip service to the significance of the competition, its clear goal was 
to retain the cup at all costs . . . (and) thus violated the spirit of the Deed 
(of Gift)." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said, "The holder of the America's Cup is bound to a higher 
obligation than the victor of the Stanley Cup or the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fairness Called the Issue 
</P>
<P>
The foundation of cup racing since its inception in 1851, the judge wrote, is 
fair competition, and the use of a catamaran strayed from that concept. "It is 
clear that a catamaran may not defend in America's Cup competition against a 
mono-hull," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Ciparick's decision and set off celebrations in Aukland, 
which calls itself "the city of sails." Joggers stopped their early morning 
exercise to discuss the news, and a fireboat motored into Auckland Harbor to 
spray its hoses. 
</P>
<P>
Fay was awakened by a phone call from an aide, who told him of the decision. 
Then Fay went for his own morning jog, receiving congratulations from his 
countrymen along the way.

U.S. PRESSURING CONTRA LEADERS TO RETURN HOME 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration is encouraging Nicaraguan rebel leaders to return to 
Managua and participate in the country's upcoming election campaign as part of 
its new diplomatic strategy in Central America, U.S. and Contra officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Putting direct pressure on the civilian Contra leaders who have operated from 
offices in Miami for the last seven years, the Administration has also told the 
rebels that the $400,000-per-month CIA subsidy of their political operation 
will be cut by more than half, one Contra official said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contra Leaders Startled 
</P>
<P>
"Exile politics is over," a U.S. official told the startled Contra leaders in a 
meeting at the State Department last week, according to several rebel 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But the Contra chiefs are bitterly divided over the issue, rebel officials 
said. One member of the seven-man leadership already has announced his decision 
to return home, but others are said to be unhappy with the U.S. decision, 
arguing that it is too early for such a move. 
</P>
<P>
State Department and CIA officials have told the Contra leaders that their main 
goal during the next 10 months should be to test the willingness of Nicaragua's 
Sandinista government to move toward genuine democracy and to conduct free and 
fair elections in February, 1990, rebel officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Their urgings are part of the new strategy toward Nicaragua authored by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, which shifts the emphasis of U.S. policy 
toward political and diplomatic pressure on the Sandinistas. Baker and 
President Bush won formal support for the new strategy last week from both 
Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, who said they also will approve 
about $40 million in non-military aid for Contra troops in the period leading 
to the elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans were very clear. They want this strategy to work," said Bosco 
Matamoros, the Contras' spokesman here. "And our objective, too, is to 
participate in a democratic political process. But to have such a process, you 
have to have a unified democratic alternative and a national dialogue, and 
these things haven't happened yet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Deadlines Noted 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has given us any deadlines for getting back to Managua," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A Contra official who refused to be identified said more bluntly: "The gringos 
might say the Contras should go back to Managua, but we're not going to go back 
just because the gringos tell us to." 
</P>
<P>
By all other accounts, however, the U.S. message was gentler than that. Alfredo 
Cesar, one Contra leader who attended the meeting at the State Department, 
described Administration officials as saying: 
</P>
<P>
"We have a new policy in place. The Nicaraguan resistance is a very important 
actor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's your personal decision. We can't force any of you to go back. We'll 
respect your decision. But the only game the Bush Administration will support 
is the game of internal politics -- the game of an internal challenge to the 
Sandinistas." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Administration's decision to cut the funding for the Contras' 
Miami-based political operation is a pointed message, rebel officials said. The 
Contras have run a CIA-funded political and public-relations operation from 
Miami since 1982, and most of their civilian leaders maintain homes there. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar has said that he expects the Administration to end entirely its funding 
of the Contras' Miami and other exile operations. But Matamoros and other, more 
conservative Contra officials said they believe the rebels must maintain at 
least a skeleton presence in Washington and Miami until the February, 1990, 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar told reporters last week that he has decided to return to Nicaragua in 
accordance with Administration's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we have a whole new ballgame," he said. "I will go back to Nicaragua 
and play the internal political game." 
</P>
<P>
He said he may return to Managua in May, depending on the progress of political 
reforms there. A wealthy businessman and political centrist, Cesar has said 
privately that he would be interested in running for president of Nicaragua if 
the opposition supported him as its sole candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's new strategy on Nicaragua seeks to focus U.S. and 
international attention on the country's election campaign as a test of whether 
the Sandinista government will deliver on its promises of genuine democracy. 
</P>
<P>
For that strategy to work, U.S. and Contra officials have said, both the 
Administration and the rebels must be seen making a good-faith effort to 
support fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Baker won agreement from the Democratic leaders of both 
houses of Congress to maintain the estimated 12,000 Contra troops until 
election day -- and made it clear that, if the election is not fair, the 
Administration may seek renewed military funding for the rebels.

Billionaire H. Ross Perot, saying the nation's capital has some of the nation's 
worst schools, urged local business leaders Tuesday to pitch in and help fight 
the city's murder, drug and crime epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"Get out of your fancy house," Perot said. "Get down there where the rubber 
meets the road . . . and say, 'Let's fix this; let's help these folks.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure self-interest, if I can't get you excited any other way, because 
you're helping the tax base," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perot, a colorful and controversial Texas businessman, spoke to more than 500 
Washington-area business leaders who support the Salvation Army at the 
charitable group's annual district luncheon. He cited Washington's surge in 
drug-related slayings, which have given it the highest per capita murder rate 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"You say, 'What can I do?' Here's what you can do. You can clean up the schools 
in this town. You can clean up streets in this town. You can make it a safe 
place for people to live."

SAW RISK OF REAGAN IMPEACHMENT, MEESE SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
HE TESTIFIES HE DID NOT PROBE DEEPLY INTO ARMS SALES TO IRAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III testified Tuesday that, during his 
investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal, he was concerned chiefly that it 
might severely damage President Reagan politically and even expose him to the 
risk of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
Meese, a prosecution witness at the trial of Oliver L. North, portrayed his 
November, 1986, inquiry into the arms-for-hostage deal as "essentially an 
administrative matter." He made plain that his investigation did not delve 
deeply into the workings of the arms sale to Iran, from which $12 million in 
profits was diverted to Nicaragua's rebels when such aid was barred by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of his mission, Meese testified, was to prevent Reagan's being 
savaged by his political enemies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wasn't Obliged to Answer 
</P>
<P>
Under those unofficial guidelines, Meese testified, North did not have to 
cooperate. He testified that the former Marine officer "had no legal 
obligation" to answer questions, "other than (as) a loyal member of the 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Meese took the stand as a witness for the prosecution, but his strongest 
comments on his concern about political damage were made during 
cross-examination by defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony centered on the 72 hours after Meese aides, on Nov. 22, 1986, 
found a computer memorandum that detailed the planned diversion to the Contras 
of money from arms sales to Iran. Meese's testimony provided an unusually vivid 
account of the frantic political climate in the White House as the scandal 
unfolded in public. 
</P>
<P>
The defense questioning of Meese seemed calculated to show that Reagan was 
deeply involved in the Iran-Contra affair -- a perception that would bolster 
the defense claim that North's effort to arm the Contras had been approved by 
his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan asked Meese if he believed that the scandal "could lead to 
impeachment." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Meese answered. 
</P>
<P>
Meese, calm throughout his testimony, said that he had discussed the concerns 
with Reagan. "I don't know whether the actual word impeachment was used," he 
said. "I certainly discussed the tremendous consequences to the President." 
</P>
<P>
Meese said that he had confronted North with the memorandum on Nov. 23, asking 
him who prepared it. Meese testified that North acknowledged preparing the 
memorandum and confirmed that the diversion plan had been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
"Your worst nightmare had come true?" Sullivan asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes . . . " Meese replied. 
</P>
<P>
"You knew that spelled trouble?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I did." 
</P>
<P>
Meese met with Reagan the next day and told him what he had learned from North. 
At that point, Meese said, he realized that the damage from the 
Administration's secret arms sales to Iran, along with secret -- and banned -- 
aid to the Contras, could be devastating to Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid further political damage, Meese and Reagan agreed to call a news 
conference, detailing the scheme. "One of the concerns was to prevent this 
situation from being used by (political) opponents of the President," Meese 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By calling Meese, the prosecution apparently sought to bolster its case that 
North had lied to his superiors about the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by prosecutor John W. Keker, Meese said that North had seemed 
surprised that the critical memo had turned up despite a massive 
document-shredding effort by North, his secretary and an aide. Also, Meese 
testified that North had said that the plan was Israel's and that U.S. 
involvement was "none." 
</P>
<P>
Meese recalled: "I told him I wanted all of the facts. I said the worst thing 
that could happen would be if someone tried to conceal anything to protect 
themselves or the President, or try to put a good spin on it." 
</P>
<P>
North, a former National Security Council official, is being tried on 12 felony 
charges, including lying to Congress to hide his efforts to arm the Contras. 
The other major charges are that he shredded documents detailing the operation 
and obstructed congressional and presidential inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Before Meese took the stand, a former deputy to North testified that the NSC 
official was shredding documents in a hallway while Meese's investigators were 
taking a lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl said that North had returned from a White House 
meeting on Nov. 21, and requested Earl's Iran files. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him what was going on," Earl testified. "He said it was time for Ollie 
to be a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
Earl said that North wanted "sensitive intelligence documents," which he placed 
atop a stack of papers. Earl understood that North was going to "sanitize" the 
files, he testified, adding that that meant destroying them. 
</P>
<P>
They both shredded documents, Earl testified. The next day, Meese's 
investigators passed North in the hall as they headed for lunch, and North 
rounded up more documents to destroy, Earl testified.

Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services, on Tuesday reversed 
his decision to forfeit severance pay earned during his previous job as a 
medical school president. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Sullivan said he will get $215,000 in 
severance benefits that had been included in his contract as president of the 
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan had previously decided to forgo the money because of concerns about 
potential conflicts of interest with his connection to the medical school, 
which receives federal grants. He made that decision despite the Office of 
Government Ethics' informal approval of the severance pay as money earned 
before he came to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Sullivan said: "I have made this agreement in the full faith 
that it in no way presents ethical difficulty, or appearance of difficulty, 
with regard to my services as HHS secretary." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan is taking an unpaid leave of absence as a professor of medicine at 
Morehouse.

FILIPINOS VOTE IN FINAL PHASE OF AQUINO PLAN

Philippine voters turned out Tuesday for nationwide village elections billed as 
the final phase of President Corazon Aquino's plan for political normalization. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said at least 16 people were killed in election day violence. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino flew by helicopter to her hometown of San Miguel, in Tarlac province 
north of Manila, and cast her ballot in a schoolhouse on her family's sugar 
plantation. 
</P>
<P>
After voting, she said the election "is a chance for all to take part in 
government down to the barangay (village) level. Once again it strengthens our 
democracy in that people are free to choose, to vote for their candidates and 
to be a part of government." 
</P>
<P>
The voting is the last stage of the political normalization process Aquino 
began after she took power from President Ferdinand E. Marcos in a revolution 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking power, Aquino has held elections for the bicameral legislature and 
town and provincial councils under her plan to restore democratic institutions 
that Marcos had dismantled. Marcos is now in exile in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
One million candidates ran for more than 280,000 positions in Tuesday's village 
council elections. Hilario Davide, chairman of the Commission on Elections, 
said 70% of the 29 million voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Final results are expected in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The elections were nonpartisan, but the military said the outlawed Communist 
Party of the Philippines had actively campaigned in a bid to win 60% of the 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino said Monday that guerrillas elected legitimately would be allowed to 
hold office despite their 20-year battle to overthrow the government. 
</P>
<P>
The village, or barangay, councils now exercise little political power. But 
Marcos used them extensively to keep himself in power for 20 years, submitting 
to them major policy decisions in rigged referendums.

JUDGE UPHOLDS SEIZURE OF ROCKET FUEL DESTINED FOR IRAN

In a major victory for the U.S. Customs Service, a federal judge ruled Tuesday 
that the agency acted properly in seizing 286,000 pounds of a rocket fuel 
ingredient that was secretly being sent to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake was highly critical of the way 
the Customs Service and the State Department handled their investigation of the 
case. He cited in particular the fact that more than a year elapsed between the 
seizure of the chemical aboard an Iranian freighter in the Dutch port of 
Rotterdam and the case's arrival in his court. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who made his ruling after a two-day hearing, also stopped short of 
blaming the export company, Girindus Corp. of Tampa, Fla., for any attempt to 
hide the cargo's true destination. He ruled only that the shipping documents 
stating that the chemical was bound for Europe were false and that proof of 
intent to violate the law is not required in forfeiture proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Girindus had asked Lake to order Customs to return the impounded cargo, but the 
agency, citing the inaccurate shipping papers, asked the court to declare it 
forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted with the results of the case today," said Customs spokeswoman 
Donna de la Torre. "We take our export enforcement program seriously." 
</P>
<P>
But David Laurain, the marketing manager for Girindus, said he was 
"flabbergasted" at Lake's decision, especially since the judge had ruled in an 
earlier preliminary hearing that Customs agents had illegally seized the 
chemical. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no false documentation," he said. "It was strictly a clerical 
error." 
</P>
<P>
The case of the rocket fuel ingredient, ammonium perchlorate, has created a 
furor in Washington, where House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.) went so far as to call it "a matter of grave national concern." 
</P>
<P>
At one point the controversy even caused the suspension of a $92-million loan 
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the Nevada company 
that manufactured the rocket fuel, Pacific Engineering &amp; Production Co. The 
loan was needed to rebuild a plant that was destroyed in an explosion last May, 
thereby creating a national shortage of the chemical. NASA reinstated the loan 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, it also came to light that two other cargoes of chemicals 
being shipped by Girindus had been impounded -- one in Belgium and the other in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Laurain testified that he never knew of the 40,000-pound Belgian seizure, which 
occurred in 1987, until the confiscation of the Netherlands shipment in 1988. 
In both cases, the buyer was the same -- D. A. Dampf, a West German chemical 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Customs agents confiscated 240,000 pounds of the chemical in Houston soon after 
the impoundment in the Netherlands. That load was eventually shipped back to 
the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
On the stand, and after the judge's ruling, Laurain maintained his ignorance of 
the Belgian seizure, saying that Dampf had never informed him of what happened. 
Customs officials said they believed the Belgian shipment also had been on its 
way to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, C. Keith Rooker, an official with Pacific 
Engineering, said he had tried to call Dampf after learning from Girindus about 
the Belgian seizure for the first time last Saturday. He said he was told that 
the Dampf office was closed and that the company's records had been seized by 
the West German government. Rooker said he was shocked to learn of the two 
apparent attempts to ship the fuel to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone asked me to sell pencils to Iran -- much less AP (ammonium 
perchlorate), I wouldn't do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the hearing, Customs officials contended that the seizure of the chemical 
was legitimate because Girindus had used two inaccurate shipping documents, one 
stating that the cargo was bound for Switzerland while another listed West 
Germany as the eventual destination. 
</P>
<P>
An official with the freight forwarder that Girindus used to send the fuel to 
the Netherlands testified that he believed a clerical error in his office had 
caused the discrepancy. But the judge ruled that the ultimate consignee was 
neither of those two destinations, but Iran -- and that Customs was therefore 
within its rights to seize the cargo. 
</P>
<P>
He also ruled that on the date of seizure, the cargo did not belong to 
Girindus, but to Dampf. The judge said that if no one else claims ownership in 
10 days, the rocket fuel component becomes the property of the Customs Service.

Strikes by bus and train workers over wages slowed millions of commuters in Rio 
de Janeiro on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all 25,000 union workers were on strike, said Luis Martins, president of 
the Bus Workers Union. A spokesman for employers said almost half the 6,200 
buses were operating. 
</P>
<P>
The union wants a six-hour day and a 30% pay increase, Martins said. Drivers 
earn about $150 per month, and employers have offered an 18% increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Train workers demanded a six-hour day and bonus pay, which employers said was

AF GROUNDS ALL B-1S AFTER WING CUTS FUEL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Air Force, in another setback for the troubled B-1 bomber, has grounded all 
97 of the $300-million aircraft because of a malfunctioning wing spotted on one 
plane, the Defense Department disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the bombers were put on "precautionary 
stand-down" Monday until the Air Force can find and correct a problem that 
caused one of the wings of a bomber to sweep too far forward. The problem, 
detected during a routine ground check, caused the wing to puncture a fuel 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The action brought an abrupt halt to the roughly 20 B-1 bomber training flights 
conducted daily at bases in South Dakota, Kansas and Texas. The Air Force said 
that the moratorium will continue until the service, working with engineers 
from the plane's manufacturer, Rockwell International Corp., pinpoints the 
cause of the problem and makes any needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready to Take Off 
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon also said that the force of bombers remains ready to take off 
on short notice and would be capable of flying its wartime mission if ordered 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The B-1 intercontinental bomber, centerpiece of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration's $260-billion effort to modernize the nation's strategic 
nuclear arsenal, is the Air Force's principal manned penetrating bomber. 
</P>
<P>
It is the third time since the planes were introduced to the force in 
September, 1986, that technical problems have grounded them. Three of the jets 
have crashed. Some industry sources say that it will cost as much as $11 
billion to fix flaws that limit the bombers' ability to perform as originally 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a frequent critic of the B-1 program, called the 
latest development "very disturbing." He said that, 2 1/2 years after the 
bomber's introduction into the arsenal, 'this kind of problem should not be 
recurring." 
</P>
<P>
The latest trouble was discovered during a preflight check of the plane at 
Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Tex., where 25 of the planes are based. The 
problem appeared to involve the plane's "variable geometry" wing, which can 
swing forward or sweep back to increase the aircraft's ability to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
"The first or second time the wings were swept, it was noted that they were out 
of sync," Pentagon spokesman Howard said. "The third time that they swept the 
wings forward, a clunking noise was heard. They shut down the aircraft and 
observed the fuel leak." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force suspects that the device that swings the wing into the forward 
position punctured the fuselage in a spot where fuel is stored. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. George H. Peck, a spokesman for the Air Force's Strategic Air Command 
in Omaha, said it is not yet known whether the problem may exist in other 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these questions have to be answered before we can go back to our 
training flights," he said. "We consider this a precursor step to a grounding." 
</P>
<P>
The B-1's fuel system has been implicated in a crash last November. The bomber 
carries its fuel in available spaces throughout the wings and fuselage, and Air 
Force experts said that leakages have been difficult to pinpoint and stem. 
After the November crash, the Air Force bolstered inspections and maintenance 
of fuel lines and began assessing possible changes in the design of the B-1's 
fuel system.

DEMOCRAT NARROWLY WINS FORMER QUAYLE HOUSE SEAT

Democrat Jill Long scored a narrow victory Tuesday over Republican Dan Heath in 
a special election for the House seat that launched the political career of 
Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Long received 65,160 votes, or 51%, to 63,388 votes, or 49%, for Heath. She 
will be the first Democrat to represent northeast Indiana's 4th Congressional 
District since Quayle won the 1976 congressional election. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third try for a Washington political office by Long, 37, who lost a 
bid for the seat last November by nearly 50,000 votes and lost the 1986 Senate 
election to Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Thundershowers, which had been predicted for the afternoon and which Democrats 
had feared would reduce turnout among blue-collar voters casting ballots after 
factory shift changes, failed to materialize Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Turnout Predicted 
</P>
<P>
With voting predicted to dip as low as 30% among registered voters, turnout 
efforts were more important than usual, party workers on both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District seat was vacated in January by Republican incumbent Dan Coats, 
who resigned to take the Senate seat Quayle occupied before becoming vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Long will serve out the remainder of Coats' term, which runs through 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion was the most emotional issue raised during the campaign. Long said she 
opposed government involvement and Heath said all abortions should be illegal, 
including those in cases of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
Heath also charged Long with running "the dirtiest campaign in northeastern 
Indiana history" with aggressive television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Heath, 36, the former safety director in Ft. Wayne, was seeking his first 
elected office. He also worked as chief of staff for Ft. Wayne Mayor Paul 
Helmke, as a district representative for Coats in 1985-87 and as an 
administrative aide to Lt. Gov. John Mutz in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won by Quayle in '76 
</P>
<P>
District voters sent Quayle to Washington as a 28-year-old congressman in 1976. 
Quayle won reelection in 1978, then gave up the seat in a successful effort to 
defeat three-term Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle and First Lady Barbara Bush campaigned earlier for the Republican 
candidate, and former Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of 
Tennessee campaigned for the Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
County election administrators decided to use paper ballots rather than voting 
machines or computer ballots to cut costs in an election that no one had 
budgeted. Allen County officials estimated that paper ballots would save 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, campaign officials in both camps said they believed the ballots would 
slow the vote count.

REMOVAL OF THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL BUSES URGED; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION INTO CRASH THAT KILLED 27 BLAMES FEATURES OF OLDER VEHICLES IN 
SEVERITY OF ACCIDENT

<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board, ending its investigation of a 
Kentucky school bus accident in which 27 people were killed, recommended 
Tuesday that more than one-fifth of the nation's school buses be phased out of 
use. 
</P>
<P>
The board said the May 14, 1988, crash was clearly caused by "the 
alcohol-impaired condition" of a pickup truck driver who was driving the wrong 
way on an interstate when his vehicle collided head-on with the bus. 
</P>
<P>
But it also said characteristics of the 11-year-old bus contributed to the 
accident's severity. The vehicle's unprotected fuel tank, flammable seat covers 
and partially obstructed rear door were all noted in the report adopted by the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The board recommended that states set a date for phase-out of buses not meeting 
1977 federal standards. If adopted nationwide, the rule would affect 77,000 
school buses, about 22% of those now in use. It would also affect thousands of 
former school buses used by church groups and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board, after 10 months of investigating the crash near 
Carrollton, Ky., also asked states to toughen their drunken-driving laws. 
Specifically, it proposed that states adopt laws that allow police to take away 
drivers' licenses, prohibit plea-bargaining in drunken-driving cases and end 
the practice of giving convicted drunken drivers reduced licensing penalties if 
they enroll in treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
Among safety improvements suggested by the board, which can only recommend 
actions to other federal agencies and the states, were making seat covers out 
of flammable material, putting more exits on school buses and making their fuel 
tanks more resistant to puncture in severe accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The board noted that a three-inch tear in the fuel tank on the Kentucky bus led 
to the fire that engulfed the vehicle. All 24 children and three adults who 
died were victims of smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prevention of Rupture 
</P>
<P>
But the board said it was unclear if such measures would have prevented that 
rupture, which it said was probably caused by a spring dislodged in the 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
The bus involved in the crash was built two weeks before the stiffened federal 
school bus safety requirements took effect on April 1, 1977. It belonged to the 
First Assembly of God in Radcliff, Ky., and was returning from an amusement 
park near Cincinnati when the collision occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup, Larry Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, Ky., is free on 
$540,000 bail, with a scheduled Nov. 8 trial date on 27 murder charges. He has 
pleaded innocent.

The House seat left vacant after the musical chairs that followed Dan Quayle's 
election as vice president was up for grabs Tuesday in a special election, with 
Democrat Jill Long and Republican Dan Heath in a close race. 
</P>
<P>
With 217 of 465 precincts reporting, Long had 28,820 votes, or 51%, to Heath's 
27,582, or 49% for the 4th Congressional District seat in 10 northeast Indiana 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans won the seat in the 1988 general election by a margin of nearly 
50,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Thundershowers, which had been predicted for the afternoon and which Democrats 
feared would reduce turnout among blue-collar voters casting ballots after 
factory shift changes, failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
With voting predicted to dip as low as 30% among more than 200,000 registered 
voters, turnout efforts were more important than usual, party workers on both 
sides said. 
</P>
<P>
Heath's press aide, Terry Holt, said earlier that the turnout could be heavier 
than predicted, a factor he said would favor the GOP. "We think if the turnout 
is between 40% and 50% we'll be in good shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heath and Long renewed their campaigns before sunrise, each opening Election 
Day with a coffee-shop stop here. 
</P>
<P>
An independent poll taken in the week before the election showed Heath with 44% 
and Long with 36%, with 20% still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th Congressional District House seat that inaugurated Quayle's political 
career was vacated in January by Republican incumbent Dan Coats, who resigned

A Westmont College student missionary died Tuesday from injuries suffered in a 
head-on collision near Ensenada, Mexico, that had already claimed the life of 
another student, officials said. A third was critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
Garth Weedman, 19, a freshman from Pacific Grove, died early Tuesday morning of 
head and internal injuries suffered Monday in an accident on Highway 1, which 
runs the length of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five Riding in Car 
</P>
<P>
Five Westmont students were in the car, which collided with another containing 
an allegedly drunk driver. The students from the Santa Barbara college were 
doing missionary work over the Easter holidays, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Bebout, 24, a senior physical education major from Mission Viejo, was 
being tested for signs of brain activity, said a spokesman for Sharp Memorial 
Hospital in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Voorman, 22, a senior in economics and business from Upland, died several 
hours after the accident just north of Ensenada about 9 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The description we have from people who saw it was that (Voorman's) vehicle 
was like an accordion," Ronald Cronk, Westmont's vice president for finance and 
administration, told the Santa Barbara News Press. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesmen said Megan Carter, 19, a freshman from Pacific Grove was in 
good condition but will require plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth student, Patty Hallock, 18, a freshman from Woodland, was also in 
good condition Tuesday night. She suffered a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Driver Is Detained 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities said they detained Ruben Rodriguez Guzman, of Baja 
California, in connection with the accident. He remained unconscious from his 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalupe Lopez, a worker for the Baja state government, said Guzman was 
believed to have been "very, very drunk" when he was removed from the scene. He 
was being detained in the medical unit at the coroner's office in Ensenada, 
pending a full investigation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Control 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol spokesman Dave Robertson in San Diego said Guzman's 
1977 Chevrolet was apparently traveling north when he lost control of the car. 
It jumped the median and slammed head on into Voorman's 1980 Toyota Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
The students were among about 450 from the Christian college who were in Mexico 
to perform services for the poor. The college has been making the pilgrimage 
for 11 years; it includes repairing churches and orphanages and medical and 
dental treatment work with local pastors.

NASA rejected a suggestion by an independent safety panel that the agency 
cancel a $1.5-billion rocket development program and direct the money instead 
toward improvements in the space shuttle. The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel 
said in its annual report that the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration should abandon plans to build an advanced solid rocket motor 
because the money could be better used to make improvements in the orbiter 
stage of the space shuttle. But NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher said NASA 
wants to develop a second-source manufacturer for space shuttle solid rockets 
so the agency is never again left without a reliable rocket engine, as it was 
after the Challenger accident.

A South Korean dissident's unauthorized visit to North Korea turned more 
controversial with word that he met North Korean President Kim Il Sung and 
discussed reunification of the two Koreas. North Korean news reports said the 
Rev. Moon Ik Hwan, 71, and three others traveling with him attended a luncheon 
given by President Kim. Moon, a Presbyterian minister who has been jailed 
often, is a leading figure in South Korea's dissident movement. Officials in 
Seoul said he will be prosecuted for aiding the north, and his visit fueled 
demands from hard-liners for a crackdown on dissident groups.

Geoffrey Howe, Britain's foreign secretary, ended a 26-hour official visit to 
Pakistan and said his country cannot recognize neighboring Afghanistan's 
guerrilla government in exile. But he promised the equivalent of about $3 
million to non-government organizations helping refugees from the Afghan war. 
About 3 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan. During his visit, a bomb 
exploded near a British cultural center in Islamabad, shortly after he was 
given a petition condemning British author Salman Rushdie's novel, "The Satanic 
Verses."

COURT STAYS HANGING OF TRIPLE MURDERER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco 
issued a stay for triple murderer Charles R. Campbell, 34, who had been 
scheduled Thursday to become the first person executed by hanging in the nation 
since 1965. The court granted the stay pending its ruling on his appeal and 
ordered additional briefs submitted by June 21. Campbell had been sentenced to 
die at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla for the 1982 revenge 
killings of Renae Wicklund, 31, her 8-year-old daughter, Shannah, and a 
neighbor, Barbara Hendrickson, 51, whose throats were slashed in the small town 
of Clearview, Wash., about 20 miles northeast of Seattle. The three were slain 
when Campbell was on work release from a prison sentence for a 1976 sexual 
assault on Wicklund. Both she and Hendrickson had testified at his 1978 trial.

Mayor James P. Moran said Alexandria, Va., will begin evicting suspected drug 
dealers from public housing now that the city has become the first in the 
country to be exempted from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's 
grievance procedures. Moran said the city would pursue evictions in cases where 
they have evidence of criminal activity either being committed or condoned by 
the leaseholder. In a shoot-out at an Alexandria public housing development 
last week, a police officer and a gunman, who had entered a building to demand 
crack cocaine, were killed, and a second officer was wounded. Without the 
exemption, HUD rules permit appeals for tenants threatened with evictions.

A Stockton Superior Court judge who fell asleep during a key part of a murder 
trial said he will give the defendant a new trial. Judge James Darrah admitted 
that he dozed for 13 minutes during the testimony of a witness, who said he was 
with defendant Tab Lee Bennett, 28, of Galt when William Lang, 25, of Lodi was 
shot to death in 1986. Bennett had waived his right to jury trial and was found 
guilty by Darrah. Defense attorney Patrick Piggott challenged the verdict, 
claiming that the judge slept through the presentation of crucial evidence. 
Piggott said he was referring to a murder scene diagram, when he noticed the 
judge was snoozing. "It's very impressive that he would do that," Piggott said 
after Darrah set April 10 for a hearing to set a new trial date.

Citing an $11-million debt, Ross Valley Medical Clinic in Greenbrae has filed 
for bankruptcy protection. Administrators said the outpatient center, one of 
Northern California's largest private clinics, will remain open while Chapter 
11 organization plans are created to cut costs and pay creditors. "What we are 
trying to do is take an ongoing losing situation and streamline it, clean it 
up, do whatever it takes to make it a viable place," said Don Lass, the 
clinic's administrator. Lass said the clinic moved into the red when it spent 
about $6 million on three nearly simultaneous expansion projects earlier in the 
decade.

WOMAN SUING LOTTERY COMMISSION FOR $3 MILLION BETS WHEELS OF JUSTICE TURN INTO 
A WHEEL OF FORTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
More than three years after Doris Barnett watched her chance at a $3-million 
California Lottery prize spin away, her hopes still ride on the bounce of a 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
For one heart-stopping moment on Dec. 30, 1985, Barnett stared as the prize 
ball she had launched around a giant wheel in the California Lottery's weekly 
Big Spin contest landed in the $3-million slot. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, the ball popped out of the $3-million slot and into the $10,000 
slot, and the Big Spin's master of ceremonies nervously tapped Barnett on the 
back. "Doris," she heard him say, "this is the hardest thing I've ever had to 
do in my life. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
What had occurred in the intervening seconds -- captured from several camera 
angles on a production studio videotape -- has become the focus of a lawsuit 
that got under way Tuesday in a county courtroom in downtown Los Angeles. In a 
case that hinges on an interpretation of gaming rules and on how long the prize 
ball sat in the $3-million slot on the Big Spin wheel, Barnett has taken on the 
state Lottery Commission in a second attempt at winning the elusive grand 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the state contend that under lottery regulations, Barnett could 
have only won $10,000 because the ball did not stay long enough in the 
$3-million slot. But her attorneys claim that the state has played fast and 
loose with its own rules, rarely adhering to their lottery regulations until 
Barnett appeared to win the Big Spin's grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic issue is what happened to the ball as the wheel came to a stop," 
Superior Court Judge Robert B. Lopez told prospective jurors Tuesday during 
jury selection proceedings. "The plaintiff says she won $3 million. The state 
states that it was $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
Doris Barnett has never doubted that she is a $3-million winner. The 
54-year-old hospital nurse says she refused to cash the $10,000 check she was 
sent by state officials after her failure to win the grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't win that (the $10,000)," Barnett insisted outside the courtroom. "I 
won $3 million." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said she began psyching herself up for the big event soon after she 
bought a qualifying Big Spin ticket at a grocery store near her Southwest Los 
Angeles house in early December, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life as a Millionaire 
</P>
<P>
The thought of winning the Big Spin set Barnett to fantasizing about life as a 
millionaire. Her first thoughts were for using the money to return to school 
and upgrading her nursing license, sending her daughters to college and paying 
for better medical treatment for her blind and ailing mother. 
</P>
<P>
By the day of the Big Spin, Barnett admits that she was so nervous, "I was 
shaking." Dressed in her finest dress, Barnett arrived at KTTV studios in Los 
Angeles with her two daughters. They sat in the audience, holding up banners 
that read: "Go, Mom, Go!" and "Win the $3 Million, Mama!" 
</P>
<P>
Barnett was the 18th contestant to take a spin on the wheel. The man in line 
before her, convinced he was a loser, whispered to her: "It doesn't look like 
I'm going to make it." He walked out to the wheel and spun a $3-million winner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lucky Spot' 
</P>
<P>
Barnett went to the same side of the wheel as the winner who preceded her. "I 
figured that was a lucky spot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She spun, and her last sight of the ball was as it bounced into the $3-million 
slot while the wheel slowed. "I heard the emcee say, 'You're another $3-million 
winner,' " Barnett recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said she "just tensed up" and "tuned everything else out." Other 
reports at the time portrayed Barnett as jumping up and down with excitement. 
</P>
<P>
But over the span of a few fateful seconds, the Big Spin prize ball suddenly 
popped out of the $3-million slot and into the $10,000 slot. Barnett said that 
lottery officials whisked her offstage, telling her that she had won only 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preliminary Statement 
</P>
<P>
Although Norman Peek, the deputy attorney general representing the Lottery 
Commission, declined to discuss the case, the state argued in a preliminary 
statement that lottery rules make it clear Barnett could only win $10,000: 
</P>
<P>
"Just as the wheel came to a stop, the ball dropped into the $10,000 segment," 
state lawyers argued in the statement. At that moment, Harold Diaz, the lottery 
drawing official on hand during Barnett's spin, "commenced timing the amount of 
time the ball was in the $10,000 slot, and that exceeded the requisite five 
seconds under the rules . . . therefore, Mrs. Barnett was awarded the prize of 
$10,000." 
</P>
<P>
But Barnett's lawyers, Lawrence Sperber and David B. Shapiro, insist that 
lottery officials had rarely abided by those rules in earlier Big Spins. 
Instead, Sperber and Shapiro claim, Big Spin contestants were often declared 
winners by the show's master of ceremonies without any timing or oversight by 
lottery drawing officials -- sometimes naming a winner even before the wheel 
stopped spinning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Verification' 
</P>
<P>
"We've reviewed dozens of videotapes of Big Spins and in mostly every case, 
there was no verification by a lottery official before the emcee announced a 
winner," Sperber said. "But when Doris Barnett wins $3 million, the rules they 
never lived by suddenly become an issue." 
</P>
<P>
And although state officials have contended that the prize ball spun by Barnett 
was in the $3-million slot no longer than three seconds, Barnett's lawyers 
insist that different video camera angles of the disputed spin suggest several 
different time spans -- ranging from 2 1/2 up to five seconds. Sperber and 
Shapiro said they planned to show the Superior Court jury several of those 
videotapes to prove their point. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez promised prospective jurors that they would observe an "interesting and 
entertaining case." He urged them to "keep your eye on the ball."

HEROES OR VILLAINS IN FRACAS ON BUS? 
</P>

A transient who threatened to stab an RTD bus driver was critically injured 
Monday after the driver and at least two passengers overpowered him and pinned 
him down in the bus' stairwell until police arrived, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A man police identified as John Bonwell, 41, was rushed to the Hospital of the 
Good Samaritan and treated for cardiac arrest possibly brought on by 
strangulation, said hospital spokeswoman, Ellen Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
"He was definitely strangled," said Brenner on Tuesday, adding that Bonwell had 
also suffered a puncture wound above his left eye. "He's in about as critical 
condition as you can get. I don't know if he's going to make it through the 
night or the week." 
</P>
<P>
Police did not arrest Bonwell and still are investigating what happened on the 
Route 20 bus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manhandling a Possibility 
</P>
<P>
Detective Frank Bishop of the Wilshire division said it is "not beyond the 
realm of possibility that the guy was manhandled. But the only thing we have 
right now is that this guy (attempted to) attack the driver . . . and he (the 
driver) was trying to hold him down." 
</P>
<P>
According to police and RTD officials, the attack occurred shortly after 4 p.m. 
Monday when RTD driver Don Smith stopped to unload passengers from his crowded 
bus at Wilton Place and Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
He was about to drive off when Bonwell appeared "and started pounding on the 
doors," Bishop said. After Smith let him on, Bonwell "was acting kind of crazy, 
yelling and screaming at the bus driver and using a lot of profanity. The 
driver felt he was going to do something. . . . The guy had said, 'I'm going to 
cut you.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Driver Stops Bus 
</P>
<P>
Bishop said Smith pulled over at Western Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, four 
blocks from where Bonwell had boarded, and opened the doors of the bus. At that 
moment, witnesses told police that Bonwell was distracted by a passenger who 
moved away from him, and Smith, seeing that the suspect was holding a folding 
knife, stood up and grabbed Bonwell's arm. 
</P>
<P>
Then "the fight was on," Bishop said. The two men wrestled with each other, and 
Bonwell knocked Smith into the bus' stairwell. Smith was able to overpower the 
suspect, getting on top of him, and "he just held him down," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of a bus behind Smith's apparently saw the altercation and notified 
a dispatcher, Bishop said. The dispatcher than notified police. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Smith had been joined by at least two unidentified male 
passengers who helped hold Bonwell down. 
</P>
<P>
Although the four or five passengers police were able to interview after the 
incident gave no indication that Bonwell had been beaten or strangled, Bishop 
said Bonwell "apparently was in an unconscious state or close to it at the time 
he was handcuffed." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe one of the people did handle the man by the neck," said Bishop, who 
added that hospital officials had not told police the extent of Bonwell's 
injuries. "I don't have any report that happened, but we're actively 
interviewing anybody we can get a hold of." 
</P>
<P>
RTD spokesman Greg Davy said it is not the agency's policy "to encourage a 
passenger to become involved in an altercation. There are all kinds of 
liability problems with the likelihood that the passenger could be hurt."

400-TON BRIDGE BEING CONSTRUCTED FOR RAIL LINE FALLS; 
</P>
<P>
PEDESTRIAN HIT BY DEBRIS AND 2 IN TRUCK CRUSHED BY SPAN ESCAPE DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 400-ton steel-and-concrete bridge being built to support the Los Angeles-Long 
Beach light rail commuter line collapsed onto Firestone Boulevard on Tuesday 
morning, injuring two men in a pickup truck that was crushed by the debris and 
nicking a pedestrian who was hit by falling lumber. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the collapse at 9:10 a.m. was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Early speculation focused on the possible failure of a timber-and-steel 
structure designed to support the span as construction proceeded in an 
unincorporated area of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
An engineer working for Los Angeles County transit officials had voiced 
concerns about the adequacy of the structure on Firestone, near Graham Avenue, 
in an internal memo filed nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers and officials likened the damage to the aftermath of an 
earthquake, with the south end of the structure dropping in lean-to fashion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bottles Toppled 
</P>
<P>
A woman who lives a block away said she, in fact, thought a temblor had hit, 
after the shaking knocked perfume bottles off her dresser. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy who witnessed the collapse said he initially presumed the 
two men in the pickup truck were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Marcos Pacheco Ramirez and Alejandro Hernandez, who were en route to 
a gardening job, survived "by inches" when falling steel girders crushed the 
cab around them, rescue workers said. Pinned in the vehicle for about 45 
minutes, they were freed when county Fire Department personnel cut though the 
roof of the cab and pried it open with the Jaws of Life. 
</P>
<P>
They were taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center for relatively 
minor injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The pedestrian, James Wilson, walked away from the accident after he was struck 
in the leg by a piece of lumber. He was examined at the King hospital emergency 
room and released. 
</P>
<P>
Three construction workers on the bridge "rode it down when it fell," but were 
apparently unhurt, said Ann Reeves, a spokeswoman with the county 
Transportation Commission, the agency responsible for the $720-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said insurance is expected to cover the loss. An official damage figure 
was not available, but the bridge is part of a contract totaling $9 million, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear, Reeves said, whether the incident will affect the July, 1990, 
target operating date. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said it was "lucky" the collapse had not occurred minutes earlier, when 
Firestone was thick with morning rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn echoed the same sentiments as he called for a 
review of similar projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Could you imagine what would have happened if this was a school bus under 
there? It would have a been a major tragedy," Hahn said as he visited the 
accident scene, which is in his district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Sought 
</P>
<P>
Hahn called for county engineers to conduct a probe of all bridge and road 
construction sites in unincorporated areas of the county. The inspection would 
pay particular attention to the light-rail project, the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor on the bridge is Morrison-Knudsen Corp., an Idaho-based 
construction firm with local offices in Irvine. When completed, the span will 
carry four tracks -- both northbound and southbound light-rail lines, as well 
as two Southern Pacific freight lines. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison-Knudsen has more than $100 million worth of contracts on the project, 
more than any other contractor, including six of the project's seven bridge 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
Even with major firms like Morrison-Knudsen, "sometimes the work can be 
sloppy," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Morrison-Knudsen declined comment Tuesday, referring questions 
to the Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said that they suspect the collapse occurred either because 
the temporary timber support structure failed or because there was a problem 
with the footing it was resting on. 
</P>
<P>
According to public records, concerns about the quality of construction on the 
Firestone bridge, including possible soil settlement problems under proposed 
temporary timber supports, were expressed last June by a project design 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Internal Memo 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear Tuesday how the problems were addressed. But the engineer, 
Steve Tayanipour, warned in an internal memo that a "poorly completed," more 
costly project could result if the problems were not addressed. He also 
complained that the issues he had raised in meetings on the project were not 
being reflected in the official minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Tayanipour could not be reached for comment Tuesday, and his supervisors 
referred inquiries to Transportation Commission officials. 
</P>
<P>
John Adams, the commission's manager of rail construction, acknowledged that 
Tayanipour had expressed concerns about the ability of the soil to support the 
timber structure. He said the commission investigation will include a review of 
how the engineer's concerns were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said he believes this to be an isolated incident. He pointed out that the 
project's safety record is above the industry's average. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
'Heard a Rumble' 
</P>
<P>
When the bridge gave way Tuesday, Sheriff's Deputy Gregory Nelson and three 
fellow deputies were in the parking lot of a mini-mall a block away. The 
officers were writing reports when they "heard a rumble" and watched the south 
end of bridge give way, snapping timbers and pulverizing the concrete traffic 
barriers beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup truck was moving west -- under the north end of the bridge -- 
meaning it escaped the full force of the collapse. But even after deputies 
worked through the debris to the truck, Nelson said, they assumed at least 
Ramirez, the owner and driver, was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Several minutes passed before someone managed to reach inside the cab and feel 
Ramirez's pulse, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was desperate. I thought I'd stay forever," said Hernandez, 19, still 
visibly shaken after he was treated at the hospital for injuries to his right 
arm and right foot and released. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said, "I felt blessed" when he realized he would live. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knocked Out 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, 30, is Hernandez's uncle. Relatives who spoke with Ramirez, the father 
of seven children, said he apparently was knocked unconscious by the impact and 
was in shock. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors decided to keep Ramirez in the hospital overnight for observation of 
possible internal injuries. The steering wheel, relatives said, had been jammed 
against his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Early thoughts of salvaging the structure were abandoned. Cleanup of the 
wreckage, which blocked Firestone all day, began Tuesday night. A demolition 
crew planned to break up the concrete structure into smaller chunks and remove 
them with a crane. The process was expected to take up to three days. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials offered motel accommodations to area residents bothered by 
the noise level of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Penelope McMillan, Henry Weinstein and Michael J. Ybarra 
contributed to this article.

YWCA, YMCA DROP COMBINED PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena YWCA on Tuesday dropped efforts to develop a joint athletic and 
social service complex with the YMCA, abandoning a project that has been beset 
with site, design and financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, said YWCA president Ernestine Moore, the group will explore ways to 
develop its property in the Pasadena civic center either on its own or with a 
financial partner. She said the plan would allow the organization to remain at 
the site in improved facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The decision leaves the YMCA without a partner in its quest for a new home near 
downtown Pasadena. The organization closed the recreation portion of its 
building across from the YWCA in February and has sold the property. 
Originally, the two organizations planned to build a joint-use facility on the 
YWCA site. But that proposed $15-million project failed last December when 
financing could not be secured.

A smaller-than-expected turnout for the 69th Easter sunrise service at the 
Hollywood Bowl Sunday left the volunteer sponsors with a $20,000 deficit, 
producer-director Norma Foster said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 6,500 worshipers attended the service instead of the hoped-for 
15,000. Foster attributed the small crowd to weather forecasts signaling a 
chance of rain. "It showered briefly about 3 or 3:30 a.m., about the time when 
many would have been rising, but the skies were clear after that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said this year's service had a budget of $53,000, of which $33,000 went 
for labor costs for lighting, sound and stage operations. This was the first 
time in three years under Foster's direction that the program has finished in 
the red; in previous years shortfalls were common, once as high as $30,000.

MAN SHOOTS MOTHER, KILLS GIRLFRIEND, SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young man shot and killed his former girlfriend, then wounded her mother 
before killing himself, Torrance police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Harold Maestri said Lee Tamashiro, 21, of Rolling Hills, went to the home 
of Stephanie Collins, 20, in the 2600 block of Grand Summit Road in Torrance on 
Monday evening, opening fire on both her and her mother, Karen, 46. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded mother escaped to a neighbor's home and called police, who arrived 
to find both Tamashiro and the younger woman dead. 
</P>
<P>
The mother was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where her wounds were not 
considered serious. He said Tamashiro, who apparently had dated Stephanie 
Collins until recently, was carrying two notes, "one to each family."

L.A. HOSPITALS TREAT SOVIET QUAKE CASES; 
</P>
<P>
14 CHILDREN ARE FLOWN HERE FOR ADVANCED CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The two teen-agers spend their days glued to a video game screen in their room 
at Centinela Hospital Medical Center. Having arrived in the United States for 
medical treatment only last week from Soviet Armenia, they have just become 
acquainted with the game. And like teen-agers everywhere, they find it 
irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
The boys are among 14 youngsters flown to Los Angeles to receive medical 
treatment for injuries suffered in the devastating December earthquake that 
leveled towns in their native land, killing at least 55,000 and leaving 500,000 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is a long way from home, especially for the boys who have never 
heard of Disneyland or Hollywood. Only Michael Jackson's name brought a smile 
of recognition to their faces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Main Concern 
</P>
<P>
Tigran Chobanian, 14, who is scheduled for leg surgery this week, said he would 
like to see a bit of the city before returning home. But like the other 
youngsters, Tigran added that his main concern was getting well and returning 
to his family. He and his immediate family were among the lucky 10% to survive 
the quake that destroyed their hometown of Spitak. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my relatives were killed," he said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the loss among others in the group was even greater. A 
3-year-old girl, whose legs have been amputated, traveled to the United States 
accompanied by her grandmother -- one of her few surviving family members. They 
lost 76 relatives in the quake, according to a doctor who had spoken with them. 
</P>
<P>
According to hospital staff members, most of the children, ranging in ages from 
2 to 16, have adjusted well to their new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"When they first arrived last week, they were very scared," said Julius Mason, 
a spokesman for Centinela Hospital. "But they've since opened up, are 
communicative and lively." 
</P>
<P>
About half of the children are undergoing surgery this week at Centinela to fix 
broken bones that have not healed correctly. Most of the others, receiving care 
at Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children, have had limbs amputated and need 
to be fitted with artificial ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donating Services 
</P>
<P>
One 2-year-old and her father are guests at the home of a Los Angeles plastic 
surgeon, who is also donating his professional services to the youngster who 
suffered extensive facial injuries in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
The children are the first group of earthquake victims from Soviet Armenia to 
come to the West Coast for treatment. About 50 other victims have been treated 
in the United States, most of them at East Coast hospitals. Still others have 
received medical assistance in several Western European countries, reported an 
Armenian doctor traveling with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Shriners hospitals, which offer services to children at no cost, provided 
treatment earlier to other young Armenian victims at several of their East 
Coast facilities. At Centinela, the Children's Charity Fund will foot the bill. 
Hospital officials there estimate that the total cost of medical services for 
the 14 children will run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles trip was arranged by Medical Outreach for Soviet Armenians, a 
nonprofit organization that has been supplying Armenian hospitals with 
equipment even before the earthquake. Its founder, Glendale-based orthopedic 
surgeon Vartkes Najarian, was on the first U.S. medical assistance plane to 
reach Armenia after the Dec. 7 quake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting List 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group have volunteered as interpreters and have prepared 
home-cooked meals for the youngsters unfamiliar with American food. Najarian 
said that the waiting list of Armenian community members hoping to visit the 
children is long. 
</P>
<P>
"Many have been turned away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the children received some treatment back home for their injuries, it 
was limited, explained Dr. Robert W. Chandler, an orthopedic surgeon at 
Centinela. 
</P>
<P>
"They're doing the best they can with limited resources," he said of the Soviet 
medical system that was overwhelmed by the earthquake's human toll. Most of the 
affected region's medical facilities were lost in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"In the midst of a disaster, the first priority is saving life and limb," 
Chandler explained. "Then you deal with the reconstructions, which is what we 
are now helping them with."

65 BUSES SIDELINED BY POSSIBLE DEFECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A possible rear-axle defect prompted the RTD on Tuesday to take 65 newly 
purchased buses out of service, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The sidelined buses are part of a fleet of 267 built by Transportation 
Manufacturing Corp. and acquired by the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District last August. 
</P>
<P>
RTD General Manager Alan Pegg said the defect in the bracket supporting the 
rear axle has appeared in coaches that have been driven 20,000 miles or more. 
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly possible that more coaches may have to be pulled from service 
in the future," Pegg said. 
</P>
<P>
The bracket, made by Rockwell International, is under warranty, and RTD 
officials said both Rockwell and Transportation Manufacturing "have indicated a 
willingness to address the problem." 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials said they will deploy older buses to replace newer coaches 
sidelined by the defect.

FINE YEAR FOR FOREIGN FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By many accounts, American film makers displayed a lean crop of Academy Award 
contenders in 1988. But judging by the five nominees in the best foreign 
language category, it was a vintage year abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, the directors of all five nominated foreign language films were in 
town Monday for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' nominees 
symposium, marking the first time in the symposium's 32 years that all nominees 
were represented. 
</P>
<P>
It is the strongest, most diverse field of contenders within memory. Some of 
the nominees are better known to the public than others -- the Danish film 
"Pelle the Conqueror" was a big winner at the Cannes Film Festival and the 
Spanish entry, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," has had a 
successful commercial run in the United States -- but if the audience at 
Monday's symposium had been polled, the results might have been a five-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
There were warm receptions to the generous clips from each film: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gerard Corbiau's "The Music Teacher" (Belgium), an elegant psychological 
study of an intense turn-of-the-century relationship between a retired opera 
star and his pupil. The film has just been picked up for American distribution 
by Orion Classics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bille August's "Pelle the Conqueror," a harsh, powerful agrarian saga, also 
set early in the century, with a tender father-and-son relationship that won 
Max Von Sydow a best actor nomination as an aging, worn farm laborer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Istvan Szabo's "Hanussen" (Hungary), an appropriately mesmerizing tale 
about a clairvoyant, played by Klaus Maria Brandauer, 
</P>
<P>
whose predictions eventually made him a threat to the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mira Nair's "Salaam Bombay!" (India), a poignant, bracing story of homeless 
youngsters struggling to survive in a big, poverty-stricken city. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pedro Almodovar's hilarious "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," 
which suggests that women are the stronger sex whether they realize it or not. 
Almodovar has called the film his tribute to American comedy. 
</P>
<P>
All five directors either wrote their films or their stories or collaborated on 
the scripts. "The Music Teacher" and "Salaam Bombay!" are first features. 
</P>
<P>
Director George Schaefer, the symposium's moderator, stressed how different the 
films are from each other and how none of them, with the possible exception of 
"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," could have been made in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Almodovar did complain about the amount of commercial interruptions on Spanish 
TV and said only half-jokingly that, as a defense, he'd love to have been able 
to make all the commercials that would be interrupting his film when it aired. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the films, "Salaam Bombay!" generated the most audience interest, since 
Nair, a Harvard-educated documentarian, brought a documentary immediacy to a 
fiction film that in fact required both intensive preparation in regard to her 
youthful non-professional cast and the flexibility of cinema verite. (In order 
to get a rain sequence, Nair actually shot from a brothel window while two 
prostitutes continued to entertain a client.) 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Nair decided that only actual street kids would do ("They are 
ageless and children at the same time") and picked two dozen youngsters out of 
the 130 originally considered for the key youthful roles. She explained that 
she then had to teach them not to act, since their notions of acting came from 
the flamboyant style of the popular Indian cinema. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from charity premieres, she said, have gone toward the establishment 
of two learning centers for street children, one in Bombay, the other in Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
Szabo, a four-time nominee -- and a winner for "Mephisto," his first 
collaboration with Brandauer -- admitted that the one point on which he 
compromised was to name his film "Hanussen" at the request of his German 
producer Artur Brauner. He had wanted to give his hero a fictional name since 
so little is known of the actual Hanussen. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the directors expressed any interest in making an American film. 
August said he would like to make a film about the Americans involved in the 
Spanish Civil War; Nair said she would like to make a movie about what happens 
to a lottery winner. 
</P>
<P>
After the symposium, the foreign directors were honored with a luncheon at 
Jimmy's hosted by Schaefer and attended by a group of Hollywood-based directors 
that included Stanley Kramer, Norman Jewison, Billy Wilder, Martin Ritt, Arthur 
Hiller, Stanley Donen, Barry Levinson and Martha Coolidge. 
</P>
<P>
Almodovar told Donen that his witty opening credits for "Women on the Verge of 
a Nervous Breakdown" were inspired by Donen's "Funny Face," an homage that 
Donen said he had noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Szabo spoke of what it had meant to him to be able to meet George Cukor, King 
Vidor, William Wyler, Rouben Mamoulian and Vincente Minelli at past luncheons. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder said that he was dubious about directors honoring other directors and 
told of the incident a few years ago when he, John Huston and Akira Kurosawa 
presented the best director's Oscar. Kurosawa had so much trouble getting the 
winner's name out of the envelope, Wilder said, that he had to resist quipping, 
"Pearl Harbor, you could find." 
</P>
<P>
But this year it was Kramer who had the last word: "Please excuse me for 
leaving early, but I have a 2 o'clock appointment with a man with $25 million."

All right, friends. Too late for office pools but just in time for Academy 
Awards parties, here are the Benson Oscar predictions, which come with the 
headstrong fearlessness of someone who has yet to win an office pool herself. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, I'll list the way I think academy members will vote first and if I 
disagree, my own immodest favorite. Reasons are given as much as practicable. 
Let's tackle the acting categories first. 
</P>
<P>
Best actor: Dustin Hoffman, because there seems to be a readable groundswell 
for him this year. My own choice would be Tom Hanks, who probably will suffer 
because academy members think it's too early in his career. Nonsense. The 
nomination was certainly for two movies, not simply one and when you consider 
"Punchline" as well as "Big" in the same year, we seem to be dealing with a 
huge and many-faceted talent. 
</P>
<P>
Best actress: Jodie Foster, from a hunch based on the affection I've seen her 
generate in appearances at various awards groups. She's regarded as a real 
Hollywood product, as a veteran and even, as one friend suggested, as the 
prodigal daughter come home again. And it is a phenomenal performance. My own 
choice, in a far less-seen and deliberately astringent film, is Meryl Streep in 
"A Cry in the Dark," who now seems to be able to throw away her formidable 
technique and come up with the pure essence of a character. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting actor: Martin Landau in "Tucker: A Man and His Dream," because it's 
a nice, safe, sentimental performance by a warmly regarded veteran. I shall 
never give up on Alec Guinness' performance in "Little Dorrit" myself, since it 
seems the distillation of a life's experience, on stage and off. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting actress: I think this is where the vote for Sigourney Weaver will go 
because I don't think she'll win in the best actress category. I guess, of the 
choices available, I'd go with Frances McDormand's delicate shadings in the 
indelicate "Mississippi Burning," although I wish enough of the academy 
nominators had seen Miriam Margolyes' Flora Finching in "Little Dorrit." Ah 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Best picture: "Rain Man" is all we hear, so it seems a safe-enough bet. For me: 
"The Accidental Tourist," whose humanity was a little less on display and thus 
a little more appealing, personally. And what a rainbow of performances it hid 
behind its quiet exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Director: Barry Levinson, for the reasons cited above. Also for the reasons 
cited immediately above, it pains me to make a personal choice from what seems 
a foreshortened field. I want "The Accidental Tourist's" Lawrence Kasdan to 
win, but he was not nominated. Deprived of that choice, I'll say Charles 
Crichton because comic charm is far too rarely encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
Art direction: "Dangerous Liaisons" feels like the solid, showy pick that the 
academy might make. My heart, in this case, belongs to the less staid and 
classic but equally difficult "Tucker." 
</P>
<P>
Cinematography: Peter Biziou's work in "Mississippi Burning" seems to be the 
sort that academy members best remember. My own choice would be Sven Nyquist's 
multifaceted contributions to "The Unbearable Lightness of Being." 
</P>
<P>
Costume design: The extremely showy costumes of "Dangerous Liaisons," where you 
could practically picnic on those panniers and pluck every one of those 
diabolical roses, would seem to be aimed straight at academy members' hearts. 
For me: the exquisite restraint and beauty of "A Handful of Dust." 
</P>
<P>
Documentary features: Nice to know that the handful who voted in this category 
actually saw the films (they had to, or they would not have been given a final 
ballot). And since that is the case, I would think that Marcel Ophuls' "Hotel 
Terminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie" would have made its singular 
impression on this thoughtful body. No quibble from me on that. 
</P>
<P>
Documentary shorts: "You Don't Have to Die," adapted from a young cancer 
patient's book addressed to children his own age would seem to be the winner 
here. The dark horse here would be "The Children's Storefront." I haven't seen 
the entire category; this hunch comes from (relatively) trustworthy friends who 
have. 
</P>
<P>
Film editing: You hear an awful lot of talk about "Die Hard" in this category, 
which may be the way the academy will swing. I think my own choice would be 
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" 
</P>
<P>
Foreign language film: For a long while it seemed as though "Pelle the 
Conqueror" had a lock on this award. Now, one hears rumbles that supporters of 
"Pelle" and "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" will cancel each other 
out and "The Music Teacher" will sneak through. Meanwhile, I'll be rooting for 
"Salaam Bombay!" 
</P>
<P>
Makeup: Let's be lighthearted and go with a double vote for "Beetlejuice" here, 
just as though Rick Baker ("Coming to America") didn't seem to be attached to 
this award like Velcro. 
</P>
<P>
Original score: John Williams is an even harder man to beat than Rick Baker, so 
this may be one place where "Accidental Tourist" wins. Two of the finest 
scores, Mark Isham's magical work on "The Moderns" and Peter Gabriel's 
superior, atmospheric music for "The Last Temptation of Christ," didn't even 
make the cut, so I feel vastly disinterested. If pushed, I guess I'd go with 
"Tourist" too. 
</P>
<P>
Original song: Could the academy resist "Calling You" from "Bagdad Cafe"? No! 
And I certainly couldn't either. 
</P>
<P>
Short film, animation: "The Cat Came Back," which is as lively as its old 
children's song, and even more fun. A double vote here. 
</P>
<P>
Short film, live action: Thin pickings this year.: "The Appointments of Dennis 
Jennings" might well be the academy pick, again on the hint of those who saw 
all three. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: Certainly, this is one of the places where the many virtues of "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit?" is recognized, no? Yes. A double yes. 
</P>
<P>
Sound effects editing: And again, I would imagine that "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit" would make its paw print here too. For me, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Visual effects: This gets down to imagination versus hard-core realism, but I 
think that "Roger Rabbit" may squeak by over "Die Hard." That would be my own 
vote too. 
</P>
<P>
Original screenplay: I think the voters will let poor old "Bull Durham" have 
its one chance in the sun here. But because I think its dialogue is more like 
great reading than great talking, my own vote slides over to "Big." 
</P>
<P>
Screenplay adaptation: Personally, this is the hardest one to psyche out. The 
Writers Guild went for "Dangerous Liaisons," which makes me think that the 
academy might too. It's hardly a secret that I am a great admirer of the work 
that Christine Edzard did in adapting "Little Dorrit" so, much as I love "The 
Accidental Tourist," I would defect here to writer-director Edzard. 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it, bets for what has certainly seemed like one of the most 
lethargic and least interesting Oscar races in years. Just think of the furor 
that might have been stirred up if a few of the notable non-nominees had been 
in the running: combinations of actors or behind-the-camera artists from "The 
Moderns," "Dead Ringers," "Clean and Sober," "Clara's Heart," "Patty Hearst," 
"Eight Men Out," "Dominick and Eugene," "The Thin Blue Line," "Crossing 
Delancey," "Hairspray," "Punchline," "Stormy Monday," "Red Sorghum," "A World 
Apart," or even the great, ineligible "Wings of Desire."

JAZZ NOTES : AMERICAN JAZZ SOCIETIES TO MEET IN CULVER CITY; CRESCENT CITY TO 
HOST NEW ORLEANS FESTIVAL 
</P>

"Jazz: One Music" is the theme of the fourth annual American Federation of Jazz 
Societies convention, to be held Friday through Sunday at the Pacifica Hotel in 
Culver City. About 200 delegates from 115 affiliated jazz societies in the 
United States and Canada -- in addition to a scattering of musicians and jazz 
aficionados -- are expected to attend the three-day event, which includes panel 
discussions, workshops, music presentations, photo and art exhibitions and 
screening of archival film footage. 
</P>
<P>
The convention's theme is also the underlying concept of the federation, which 
was formed in 1984. "There's always been a schism between jazz fans, like 
modernists and traditionalists, and this organization was formed, and this 
theme was chosen, in an effort to bring (these factions) together," said Floyd 
Levin, who founded the Southern California Hot Jazz Society, the second oldest 
society in the United States, in 1949. (The first, the New Orleans Jazz 
Society, was founded in 1948.) 
</P>
<P>
The prime purpose of the convention is "to perpetuate jazz and retain a grasp 
of the historical elements that make our music so important," said Levin, who 
has written on jazz for such publications as Jazz Journal, Jazz Forum, 
Metronome, down beat and Coda. 
</P>
<P>
The panel discussions and workshops, whose topics range from "The Making of 
'Bird' " to "Raising Money for Jazz," are basically open only to convention 
delegates, says Levin, "though if someone is interested in attending a program 
on a seat-availability basis, there would be no problem," nor a charge. The 
public may pay a $75 convention registration fee, which includes tickets for 
all events, plus four meals, Levin added. 
</P>
<P>
Separate tickets are available for the musical presentations -- by such jazz 
players as clarinetist Abe Most's quintet, altoist Charles McPherson's quartet 
and the Jazzin' Babies Jazz Band -- and for "Jazz From Harlem to Hollywood," an 
evening of jazz films from the library of Mark Cantor. The concerts are priced 
at $10, the films at $5. Information: (213) 654-1610. 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL CELEBRATES ITS 20TH YEAR IN NEW ORLEANS: Tickets are now on sale for 
the 20th Annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, to be held in several 
venues in Crescent City, April 28-May 7. Such artists as Miles Davis, Wynton 
Marsalis, the Neville Brothers, Al Green, Dr. John, Etta James, Art Blakey and 
Pete Fountain are among the hundreds of jazz, blues, R&amp;B, pop and New 
Orleans-based performers scheduled to appear. For a complete lineup, call (504) 
568-0251. 
</P>
<P>
**** James Williams' "Magical Trio 2" (EmArcy) finds the youthful pianist 
plying his formidable wares in the company of two aces -- drummer Elvin Jones 
and bassist Ray Brown. Williams, who bears a strong McCoy Tyner influence, 
smokes two burning versions of "Bohemia After Dark," offers a nice modern 
shuffle on his own "Road Life" and exhibits a powerful blues presence on 
"Lullabye of the Leaves." His partners never falter.

JIMMIE AWARDS MARK DISPELLING OF RACE STEREOTYPES

<P>
The Assn. of Asian-Pacific American Artists handed out its fifth annual Media 
Awards at the Beverly Hilton on Monday night, honoring film and television 
producers, playwrights and a veteran talent agent for working to dispel racial 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
The Jimmie awards, as they are called, are named for the late Academy 
Award-winning cinematographer James Wong Howe. 
</P>
<P>
Yue-Sai Kan, Chinese-born producer and host of two magazine-style television 
series, "One World" and "Looking East," seen on UHF and cable stations in this 
country and on Chinese television, won the group's Lifetime Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included the film "The Moderns" for its casting of an 
Asian-American, John Lone, in a starring role "neither conceived as nor written 
for a person of color." 
</P>
<P>
"Coming Into Passion -- Song for a Sansei," written by Jude Narita, took the 
best-play honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot from this play," Narita said. "I learned that people respond 
to what comes from your heart and I learned that the time for accepting 
identities that are demeaning and dismissible caricatures of whole 
nationalities . . . that that time is over." 
</P>
<P>
David Henry Hwang won a playwright award for his body of work. Last year, he 
won a Tony award for his Broadway play "M Butterfly," becoming the first 
Asian-American to win a Tony. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Kan Gotanda also was honored for his body of work, which includes 
"The Wash" and "Yankee Dawg You Die." 
</P>
<P>
"Who Killed Vincent Chin?" -- co-produced by Christine Choy and Renee Tajima -- 
was judged the best documentary. It chronicled the events surrounding the 
baseball-bat bludgeoning of a young Chinese-American in Detroit by auto factory 
workers who mistook him for a Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy's Law" was honored as best television series and was cited as the first 
network series to co-star an Asian-American, Maggie Han, and "utilize the 
performer in a non-stereotypical manner." 
</P>
<P>
Talent agent Bessie Loo won the Pioneer Award for starting a talent agency that 
specializes in Asian-American artists. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour awards show, hosted by television commentator Mario Machado, will 
be televised in Mandarin on KSCI, Channel 18, on April 23 at 7:30 p.m., and 
then in English on KLCS, Channel 58, on May 2 at 9 p.m. CLAUDIA PUIG

STORY SAYS UNLV PAIR GOT CASH; 
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINE REPORTS MOSES, SCURRY WERE PAID BY GAMBLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Nevada Las Vegas basketball players Moses Scurry and David Butler reportedly 
received cash last October during a lunch at Caesars Palace with a man who 
twice has been convicted of sports bribery, according to a story in Time 
magazine's April 3 edition, which was on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Butler said by telephone from the UNLV basketball office Tuesday that he 
did not receive any money at the Oct. 18 lunch with a man he knew only as Sam 
Perry, who coached Scurry as a youngster in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Scurry could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, asked if Scurry received money, said: "I really don't know. You'd have 
to ask Moses about that." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine reported that Perry told Art Ross, a former coach in the 
Continental Basketball Assn., "I gave them a hundred bucks, so what?" 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said his understanding is that Scurry was given no 
more than "$20 to pay the tip for lunch or something." 
</P>
<P>
Perry, also known as Richard (the Fixer) Perry, according to the magazine, was 
convicted in 1974 in connection with a betting scandal at Roosevelt and Yonkers 
raceways in New York, and pleaded guilty in 1984 to conspiring to commit sports 
bribery as part of a Boston College point-shaving scheme, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said Monday that he knew Perry as Sam Perry and that Perry had told 
him he was "in commodities." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said he met Perry in 1986 when Perry was one of a number of people to 
tell him that Lloyd Daniels, a talented New York high-school dropout, was 
interested in playing at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels signed a letter of intent to attend UNLV in 1986. In 1987, he was 
arrested in Las Vegas for allegedly attempting to buy rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian announced afterward that Daniels would never play for UNLV, and says 
that Perry was outraged at that announcement and that he has not spoken to 
Perry since. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said UNLV has "no relationship in any way" with Perry, and that he 
"didn't know anything" about Perry's background until the magazine approached 
him. 
</P>
<P>
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules prohibit athletes receiving extra 
benefits from people defined as representatives of a school's athletic 
interests, a category that includes those who do such things as contribute 
money, attend booster functions or provide scouting information at the request 
of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is ridiculous," Tarkanian said. "We have no relationship with 
Sam Perry. We have a million people come to Las Vegas. He coached (Scurry) or 
knew (Scurry)." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Hilliard, a director of enforcement for the NCAA, said he was unaware of 
the report until asked to comment on it, but said that "potentially there could 
be a problem anytime a student-athlete receives money," and that the key 
consideration could be whether the individual is classified as a representative 
of the school's athletic interests. 
</P>
<P>
"If he were involved in gambling or a known gambler, we would always be 
interested in reviewing the matter," Hilliard said. "That's always a sensitive 
matter. . . . Not only would the NCAA be interested, but also the Justice 
Department."

GOSSAGE, NIPPER GIVEN UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE BY CUBS

The Chicago Cubs Tuesday released Rich (Goose) Gossage, one of baseball's 
premier relief pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
The club said Gossage and another pitcher, Al Nipper, were given unconditional 
release, trimming the team roster to 27 players. 
</P>
<P>
Gossage finished the 1987 season with 289 career saves, 52 behind Rollie 
Fingers' major league record of 341. Coming into last season, he had made 577 
consecutive relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
But his career floundered with the Cubs, who acquired him from San Diego for 
Keith Moreland in February, 1988. He had a 4-4 record last season and had a 
4.33 earned-run average in 46 games. 
</P>
<P>
Nipper, 29, came to the Cubs with Calvin Shiraldi in a trade with the Boston 
Red Sox in December, 1987. He was 2-4 with 3.04 ERA in 22 games, including 12 
starts.

The last time Glenn Hoffman played in the major leagues was 1987, and he was 
wearing a Dodger uniform. The Dodgers released him that year and he spent the 
1988 season in Pawtucket, the triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman hit .240 with three home runs and 33 runs batted in at Pawtucket, then 
was released again. At 30, the outlook for his professional baseball career 
wasn't exactly bullish. 
</P>
<P>
His stock is definitely on the rise these days, however. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Angels announced that they had released 40-year-old Davey 
Concepcion from his minor league contract. Although no one will say that 
Hoffman has been assured a spot on the 24-player roster as the utility 
infielder, Manager Doug Rader did admit that "it certainly does look good for 
the lad." 
</P>
<P>
So it appears that Hoffman, who lives in Orange, will return home as a big 
leaguer after having to call the Angels and ask for an invitation to spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"Hoffman has been doing an excellent job," Rader said. "I believe he should 
make this club. He certainly has earned a spot on this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman is hitting .393 and has three RBIs. He has made just one error in 16 
games. Concepcion, a veteran of 19 major league seasons, was hitting .125, with 
no RBIs and two errors in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on the other side of spring training, when you're a regular and just 
getting ready for the season," said Hoffman, who was the starting shortstop for 
the Red Sox in the mid-'80s. "This has been a whole different kind of spring. 
When you come in as a non-roster player, you have to go out there and try to 
win a job every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to show what I can do. I came in as a very long shot, but I guess it 
looks a lot better for me now." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's performance was good enough to convince even Concepcion, who Tuesday 
asked Angel management to release him if he wasn't going to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Davey saw how Hoffman was playing and evidently he was aware of some inquiries 
from other clubs," Rader said. "He's a good man. I hope he can hook on 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, of course, is happy to be hooking on with any major league club, 
especially one that plays its home games a few minutes down the freeway from 
his house. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel brass still has a few decisions to make and there are some options, 
but it appears the roster will break down like this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitchers: Jim Abbott, Bert Blyleven, Chuck Finley, Willie Fraser, Bryan 
Harvey, Vance Lovelace, Kirk McCaskill, Bob McClure, Greg Minton, Dan Petry and 
Mike Witt. Either Abbott or Lovelace or both will make the team (if the Angels 
decide to go with an 11-man staff). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Position players: Tony Armas, Dante Bichette, Chili Davis, Brian Downing, 
Jim Eppard, Glenn Hoffman, Jack Howell, Wally Joyner, Mark McLemore, Lance 
Parrish, Johnny Ray, Dick Schofield, Bill Schroeder, Claudell Washington and 
Devon White. Bichette and McLemore appear to be on the bubble. If the Angels 
keep 11 pitchers, both could start the season in the minors. Eppard and Armas 
seem to be on a somewhat sturdier bubble. 
</P>
<P>
A batting order of Brian Downing, Johnny Ray, Devon White, Wally Joyner, Chili 
Davis, Lance Parrish, Claudell Washington, Jack Howell and Dick Schofield 
should produce some runs this season, but it's beginning to look as if the 
Angels might lose more than a few of those 9-8-type decisions. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, they lost to the San Diego Padres, 9-1, in front of 4,169 at Angels 
Stadium. Starter McCaskill yielded eight runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Lovelace did not do much to help his cause, either. He replaced McCaskill with 
two on and two out in the sixth, walked John Kruk and gave up a two-run double 
to Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Miller, who was placed on waivers Monday, has mixed emotions about his 
parting with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy about the way things have gone," Miller said from his home in 
Yorba Linda, "but they didn't do me any favors with the timing. They waited 
until most of the (major league) rosters were set." 
</P>
<P>
If the Angels had released Miller today, they would have had to pay him his 
full $157,000 salary. As it is, they only have to come up with one-sixth of 
that figure ($26,167). 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who will clear waivers at noon on Thursday, said he asked the Angels 
twice this spring to either try and to trade him or release him if he was not 
in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to them once early during the trip to Yuma (March 3-5) and again about 
three days after we got to Palm Springs," he said. "I asked for a chance to 
play, to show someone I can play, so they could trade me. They said, 'We know 
what you can do. That's why we're not playing you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that he was encouraged by the interest shown by other teams, but 
said he could not get be specific until he passes waivers. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players Assn., spoke to 
both the Angels and Padres for almost three hours Tuesday morning. He said the 
meeting was held to update the players on contract negotiations and the 
possibility of a lockout by the owners. . . . The scheduled pitching matchups 
for the Freeway Series, which begins Thursday at Dodger Stadium: The Angels' 
Mike Witt vs. the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser and Tim Belcher Thursday; Chuck 
Finley vs. Tim Leary Friday night, and Bert Blyleven vs. undecided Saturday 
night.

DODGER NOTEBOOK;

GIBSON OUT OF ACTION, SEEMS OUT OF OPENER

The Kirk Gibson watch passed yet another day Tuesday with no sign of the Dodger 
outfielder in uniform, further increasing speculation that he will not play 
Monday in Cincinnati, when the Dodgers open the 1989 season against the 
Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson is expected to accompany the team to Los Angeles when the Dodgers break 
camp after this afternoon's exhibition with Montreal, their last in Florida. On 
Thursday night, they begin the Freeway Series with the Angels, with the first 
game scheduled for Dodger Stadium and the final two in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson offered no comment on his condition Tuesday, but was in street clothes 
while the Dodgers were beating the New York Yankees, 11-10, in Holman Stadium. 
He is still recovering from the flu and also has some tendinitis in his right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Another flu victim, Orel Hershiser, said he will pitch Thursday against the 
Angels, presumably a tuneup for an Opening Day assignment. Pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski said he plans to split Thursday's game between Hershiser and Tim 
Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mike Morgan probably eliminated any lingering suspense regarding the 
Dodgers' No. 5 starter by shutting out the Yankees in five innings of three-hit 
ball. Morgan struck out five and did not walk a batter and was clearly pleased 
with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
The former American Leaguer, whose only hitting experience has been in spring 
training, even had a single in his one official plate appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have given me the ball," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
He'll get the ball from the Dodgers, judging from the reaction of Perranoski. 
</P>
<P>
"He did some real pitching today," Perranoski said. "His last time out I think 
he was trying to force everything, overthrowing. But he had an excellent 
curveball and a changeup today." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan reiterated that he would be content either as a starter or reliever. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm better off not knowing my role," he said. "I get so hyped up for games, 
I've got to tone it down. With relieving, you never know when you're coming in. 
</P>
<P>
"All my bullpen opportunities in the past have been demotions (from starting). 
I've never been handed a bullpen spot." 
</P>
<P>
The two stalwarts of the Dodger bullpen, Jay Howell and Alejandro Pena, made 
things suspenseful in the ninth inning, when the Yankees hit three home runs -- 
by Don Slaught, Mel Hall and Randy Velarde -- to score seven runs and all but 
wipe out an 11-3 Dodger lead. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, another flu victim, has pitched just 8 innings this spring, but 
Perranoski said he'll be ready when the season starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to pitch every day in the Freeway Series," Howell said with a smile, 
"but I think I'll take tomorrow off, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan, putting a flourish on what has been an exceptional spring, had 
a double and three-run home run for the Dodgers. Mike Marshall, playing for the 
first time after a week-long bout with the flu, singled in a run, and Jeff 
Hamilton, recovering from a pulled thigh muscle, had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Willie Randolph left the game in the sixth inning when he 
received word that his wife, Gretchen, had been taken to the hospital. Dodger 
officials said she underwent an appendectomy. Infielder Dave Anderson, 
meanwhile, who is hitting .120, has a pinched bursa in his shoulder and sat out 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Dodger Steve Sax made the trip and had one hit in four trips.

Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon of Puerto Rico granted immediate parole eligibility 
to former boxing champion Esteban de Jesus, who was sentenced to life in prison 
for murder and later found to be afflicted with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
De Jesus was found guilty of first degree murder in 1981 for shooting to death 
a youth during a street brawl. By advancing his parole eligibility from 1993, 
the governor in effect commuted de Jesus' sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The parole board has agreed to release de Jesus "on the condition that he be 
transferred to the Faith Home of the Americas, where AIDS patients are 
treated," said a statement released by the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
De Jesus, 37, was World Boxing Council lightweight champion from 1976 to 1978. 
He retired from professional boxing in 1980.

JAMES FLANIGAN: POSTURING ISN'T A WAY TO CLEAN ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here come the good intentions. In the aftermath of the Alaska oil spill, one 
certainty is that there will be new environmental regulations proposed in 
Washington and new attention paid to environmental dangers. There will be calls 
for new laws. There may even be new laws passed. 
</P>
<P>
But attention will wane and outrage will fade, as it has so often before, which 
is why after almost 20 years of laws on clean air and water, the environment is 
still not a priority in business or even in national politics. 
</P>
<P>
That's why, nine years after an $8.5-billion federal Superfund was created to 
clean up hazardous waste sites, very few sites have actually been cleaned up. 
What passes for an environmental industry is a fragmented collection of small 
and often financially troubled companies. 
</P>
<P>
Why such chaos? Because environmental issues are often more emotional than 
economic. Environmental activists see a cause, industry sees a cost and 
sensible measures are seldom agreed upon. Ordinary people oppose pollution but 
won't get out of their cars and don't want environmental regulations 
interfering with their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
So when something like the accident of the tanker Exxon Valdez happens, 
responses seem incompetent. Nothing is done for a day or two while 250,000 
barrels of oil ooze out to make the worst spill in U.S. history -- and then it 
is too late to do many things. There seems to be no preparedness -- no 
equipment at hand to clean up the mess, no instant mobilization of expert 
forces. If the oil industry or any business ran its other operations as it does 
environmental preparedness, insurance companies would have a fit. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of preparedness, we get a state of emergency. President Bush 
dispatched government officials to Alaska on Tuesday to "take a hard look" at 
the oil spill and judge whether the government should take over the massive 
cleanup job from Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
It probably won't. There will be a lot of political huffing and puffing, but 
the government ultimately will find that Exxon is doing the job. If it didn't, 
the government would be hard put to hire anybody else to do the cleanup anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon, which has its own crisis management people at work in Alaska, is hiring 
"everybody" in the waste cleanup business to lend a hand, according to a 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
There are not many firms to choose from, and none of the companies are large or 
well known. One of the larger is International Technology in Torrance; others 
include OHM Corp. of Findlay, Ohio; Roy F. Weston Co., a consulting firm in 
West Chester, Pa., and Canonie Environmental of Porter, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, these and other companies have known the surge of 
enthusiasm for cleaning up the environment and then the fading of the issue in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a business driven by regulation and governed by surges of political 
attention," says analyst Mark Pytosh of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., who says 
environmental activity has been recovering recently with renewed Superfund 
efforts to clean up hazardous waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
But even when there's activity, it's questionable how much is getting done. 
"There may be 300 to 400 sites to be cleaned up," says Pytosh, "but cleaning 
them up would cost real money, and no government official is going to sign off 
on a $20-million job. So they spend $500,000 at a time on consultants, and only 
about 30 or 40 sites have actually been cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
Another Wall Street analyst explains the environmental decline in the 1980s 
this way: "The Reagan Administration wasn't aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
But that's just the point. On other issues, it no longer matters whether one 
political party or administration is "aggressive." Fire safety in buildings and 
workplaces is not a concern that waxes and wanes. It's a priority, and 
insurance companies make sure it is taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
What could make the environment a similar priority? It wouldn't take much -- a 
decent level of attention, perhaps some unemotional lawmaking. Regulations 
could be tightened on tankers, for example, to require double hulls and other 
protection from spills. (The Exxon Valdez was not so equipped.) In the case of 
tankers, the United States -- which imports 2 1/2 billion barrels of oil a year 
-- could legislate protection worldwide. If you want to deliver to the big U.S. 
market, outfit your tanker properly. 
</P>
<P>
Such measures have costs, of course. But oil spills, especially in choice 
fishing grounds like Prince William Sound, have incredible costs -- which Exxon 
and its insurance firms will be paying for years. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, it is the burden of such payments that may well make oil and 
other industries increase their commitment to the environment -- as chemical 
companies have already done. 
</P>
<P>
Making environmental matters a business priority may not prevent accidents, but 
it can make them more manageable than the spreading ooze in Alaska seems to be 
this week.

HOUSING PRICES IN STATE CLIMB 3% IN FEBRUARY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIAN RESALE PRICE IS $190,000, REALTORS SAY -- A 27% JUMP IN 12 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Continuing their relentless climb, housing prices throughout California jumped 
another 3% last month, boosting the median resale price of a single-family 
house in the state to more than $190,000, a real estate trade group said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The latest increase means that the median price of an existing house in 
California has risen 27% in the last 12 months, the largest year-to-year 
percentage rise in nine years, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
Real estate experts attributed the jump in February -- the largest 
month-to-month rise since last June -- to a rush by buyers to acquire houses 
before mortgage rates rise further. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, like cooler weather pushing back hot Santa Ana winds, the temperature of 
the California housing market is thought to be gradually cooling down from the 
white-hot conditions that prevailed last spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate analysts and experts believe that the boost in February housing 
prices reflects a "last hurrah" of strong buying activity that will not last in 
the months ahead as mortgage rates continue their climb. Some fixed-rate home 
loans in California have already surpassed 12%, while introductory rates on 
variable rate loans are approaching 10%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Environment Stabilizing 
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the eventual effect of higher interest rates and general 
economic uncertainty, combined with the state's ongoing housing affordability 
problem, will begin to slow sales activity in the months ahead," Leo Saunders, 
a real estate broker in Walnut Creek, said in a statement. Saunders is 
president of the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The California home market has been in the grip of a buying frenzy that 
commenced in 1987 and reached a peak last summer. It has been a classic 
sellers' market in which homeowners found themselves besieged by multiple 
offers that drove sale prices far in excess of asking prices. 
</P>
<P>
Today, though, the sellers' market is being replaced by a stabler sales 
environment in which multiple offers are not that common and it usually takes 
several weeks -- not days -- to sell a home, real estate brokers and agents 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"The party is over," said real estate agent Joan Wilson, who works for Grubb 
&amp; Ellis in southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Though housing prices will certainly go up in 1989, the increases will not be 
nearly as large as they were in 1988, according to Joel Singer, chief economist 
for the realtors' association. "Those kinds of increases are not sustainable," 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's soaring prices made housing in parts of Southern California once 
again the most expensive in the nation. By the end of 1988, the median price of 
a single-family home in Orange Country reached $237,114, an astounding 32% jump 
in 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The increases have been windfalls for homeowners whose equity has doubled and 
tripled in value on the strength of the price surge. 
</P>
<P>
The prices rises have also been a boon for brokers, whose commissions usually 
rise in proportion to sale prices. Brokers prefer commissions to be at least 6% 
of the sale price of a home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Land Shortage 
</P>
<P>
A slowing in the housing-price spiral would be welcome news for first-time 
buyers, who are bedeviled by both rising prices and higher mortgage rates. Only 
about one in four householders could afford a median-priced home in California 
at the end of last year, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Even some brokers are welcoming the stabler environment and the elimination of 
the cutthroat competition among brokers for sales that existed last summer. 
"Thirty percent (appreciation) is too high," Beverly Hills broker Jon Douglas 
said. "I think everyone believes that." 
</P>
<P>
Though the market is expected to cool shortly, demand in many areas remains 
high. Home prices in metropolitan Los Angeles are buoyed by a shortage of homes 
that springs from a scarcity of vacant land and tough local growth limits 
designed to head off further congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the classic case of demand exceeding supply," said Richard Merrill, who 
heads the Beverly Hills office of Merrill Lynch Realty. 
</P>
<P>
While the population of metropolitan Los Angeles increased by more than 1 
million between 1981 and 1988 and jobs grew by 447,000, only 331,000 new 
housing units were built during those years, according to Real Estate 
Perspectives, a newsletter in suburban Washington published by Arthur Andersen 
&amp; Co and Michael Sumichrast. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be building more homes out there (in Los Angeles)," said 
Sumichrast, an economist formerly with the National Assn. of Home Builders. 
"Not many cities can say that." 
</P>
<P>
But even in the less crowded counties east of Los Angeles, where building has 
boomed in recent years, supply is a problem. "Try to find 100 lots to build on 
in (Rancho) Cucamonga," said Bruce Karatz, head of Los Angeles-based Kaufman 
&amp; Broad Home Corp., the state's largest builder of single-family homes. 
"You can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recession a Concern 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, the home market remains hot, still fueled by first-time 
buyers who had been renting apartments in adjacent Orange County for up to 
$1,500 a month. For the same monthly payments, renters can buy homes in 
Riverside County where homes generally range in price from $85,000 to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't even question the prices," said real estate broker Gail B. Berge, 
referring to the Orange County refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The question of where mortgage rates are going is probably the greatest 
uncertainty now facing the state's housing market. 
</P>
<P>
The more home loan rates go up, the less affordable houses become, particularly 
for first-time buyers. The monthly mortgage payment on a 30-year, $100,000 loan 
at 10.5% is $915. Boost the mortgage rate to 12% and the payment jumps to 
$1,029 a month -- a difference that exceeds $1,300 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers see big trouble ahead if fixed-rate loans rise into the 
"teens." "If rates continue rising and approach 13%, it's going to hurt," Berge 
said. "Then, there really will be a slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
The worst fear is that rising interest rates will spark a deep recession 
reminiscent of the dark days of 1981 and 1982 when double-digit mortgage rates 
put the California housing market into a deep freeze. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the latest price rises have homeowners searching for ways to 
capitalize on their new-found wealth. Some property owners -- weary of crime, 
smog and congestion -- are selling or thinking of selling their homes at top 
dollar so they can move to less crowded, less expensive areas.

OIL FIRMS HAVE DETAILED PLANS TO HANDLE SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five hours after the damaged tanker Exxon Valdez unleashed the nation's largest 
oil spill, members of Exxon's Casualty Response Team were headed to the growing 
slick off the Alaskan coast. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 members of the team -- who handle different aspects of such 
emergencies, from cleanup to salvage operations -- had soon established a 
command center and were placing orders for emergency equipment as spelled out 
in company disaster plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just in our best interests to have a comprehensive response to something 
like this," said an Exxon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20 years since the disastrous Santa Barbara Channel oil spill, energy 
companies have drawn up detailed battle plans to respond to such emergencies 
under growing government and public pressure. Industry officials also have 
plans to handle many other emergencies, such as refinery fires, broken 
pipelines, oil derrick explosions and overturned gasoline tanker trucks. But 
the plans do not always live up to real-life situations. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon, for example, and other companies have been chastised for taking too much 
time to respond to the spill near Valdez, Alaska. "It always pays to plan 
ahead," said Amy Stolls, editor of the Oil Spill Intelligence Report. "It's 
unfortunate that it didn't work out in this situation. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government requires oil companies to comply with what is called a 
National Contingency Plan, which is tailored to handle problems that occur on 
coastlines and at oil facilities. The plan spells out which agency or company 
will be in charge of the many groups involved in the containment and clean-up 
of oil spills. The Environmental Protection Agency and many state agencies -- 
such as the California Coastal Commission -- require oil companies to submit 
disaster response plans for refinery explosions as well as tanker spills. 
</P>
<P>
Cities also have paid more attention to such plans and possible disasters in 
the past 20 years. In El Segundo, home to the Chevron refinery -- Southern 
California's largest -- city safety officials have become more concerned as 
office buildings have sprung up along the south side of the plant. Many of 
those office buildings will be notified of a major emergency by a special 
electronic system. Chevron and city fire units train together at least three to 
four times year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have intensified our relationship out of necessity and of increased 
awareness in our community," said El Segundo fire chief Robert Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Simulations 
</P>
<P>
Like Exxon, many of the large energy companies have also established teams of 
executives and specialists -- Shell calls its unit RATs, for Response Action 
Teams -- trained to deal with emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Besides technical and engineering specialists, Mobil's response team includes 
experts from the purchasing and legal departments. "They can write a contract 
on the spot," said Jim Carbonetti, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies and government agencies also have employed the latest in computer 
technology. Computer simulations, for example, will show in what direction oil 
spills will flow given certain wind and wave conditions. 
</P>
<P>
At its refinery in Torrance, Mobil has two large trailers that act as traveling 
command centers. They are equipped with everything from maps to satellite 
hook-ups that allow officials at the scene of an emergency to talk to experts 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The oil spill off the Santa Barbara coast 20 years ago forced companies to look 
at disaster planning more closely, say industry experts. "They were not that 
sophisticated," said Jack Gould, senior environmental scientist at the American 
Petroleum Institute. "We had never had an oil spill that big." 
</P>
<P>
The spill also spawned the creation of oil industry cooperatives designed to 
handle such calamities. Clean Seas, one of the first such cooperative 
established after the Santa Barbara spill, covers the California Coast from 
Cape San Martin on the Central Coast to Point Dume off Malibu. Its three ships, 
staffed around the clock, can respond to most spills within one to two hours. 
Mr. Clean 3, one of the three ships, is usually anchored off Point Dume. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Winds Stall Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
Speed is essential in responding to such emergencies, say experts. "Your best 
chances for reducing and mitigating damage are during the first two or three 
days," said Michael Garnett, executive vice president for Hudson Maritime 
Services, a marine consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But even the best laid plans and preparation fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, two cargo ships collided off the Southern California coast, causing 
3,000 barrels of fuel oil to spill into the ocean. Although Clean Seas was on 
the scene within two hours, high winds stalled cleanup efforts for nearly a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most of the spill was cleaned up by the sea itself. "If the 
mechanical equipment is (sidelined)," said Skip Onstead, manager of Clean Seas, 
"then the natural forces of the sea tend to break up the spill." 
</P>
<P>
In the recent Alaska spill, the remote location and the Easter holiday led to 
confusion and the unraveling of the disaster plan that was in place, say 
industry experts. The question federal and state officials will now be asking, 
said Stolls, is "If we have such a great plan, why didn't it work?"

TEXAS AIR CONSIDERS UEBERROTH OFFER FOR EASTERN; 
</P>
<P>
TWA'S ICAHN ALSO SAID TO BE INTERESTED BUT FEARS LAWSUIT FROM LORENZO

As Texas Air Corp.'s board of directors gathered in Houston to consider a bid 
from baseball executive Peter V. Ueberroth to buy its Eastern Airlines, another 
potential suitor indicated that he, too, remained interested in buying the 
strike-crippled carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Carl C. Icahn, owner of TWA, wants to make a bid for Eastern, said Brian 
Freeman, a financial adviser to the International Assn. of Machinists. But he 
said Icahn is reluctant to act because Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo 
"threatened to file a lawsuit against him alleging tortuous interference with 
business relations." 
</P>
<P>
Another source who has been in contact with Icahn said the TWA owner is "very 
unhappy that Texas Air is allowing all prospective bidders to talk with the 
unions except him. He thinks he is entitled to a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's three unions are at the center of buyout talks because prospective 
buyers want to know what concessions the unions would make to a new owner. 
Among other things, it is considered critical for Eastern to lower its labor 
costs to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Art Kent, a spokesman for Texas Air Corp., declined to comment on the prospects 
of a Ueberroth bid or any matter involving a possible sale of Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources said the Texas Air board would consider a bid today from a 
consortium headed by Ueberroth. Carl R. Pohlad, the owner of the Minneapolis 
Twins baseball team who is a Texas Air director, reportedly is one of those 
supporting a sale to Ueberroth, whom he greatly admires. 
</P>
<P>
Pohlad declined to return calls Tuesday and Ueberroth declined comment when 
asked about the possible deal. But Eastern pilots were hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's pretty ecstatic," said Rick Chapman, an official with the Eastern 
pilots union. "We hope this comes true. We're trying to keep a lid on the 
euphoria." 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Air Line Pilots Assn. said Tuesday that that they 
understood that entertainment mogul Kirk Kerkorian, who has known Ueberroth for 
close to 30 years, is the principal backer in what would be a $500 million to 
$600 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
But Terry Christensen, Kerkorian's lawyer, reiterated on Tuesday statements 
made Monday that Kerkorian is not involved in any deal to buy financially 
ailing Eastern, which has lost more than $500 million in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the unions said Kerkorian's role in the deal may be 
diminished, but that other substantial backers, possibly including Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc., would provide the financing for Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the machinists noted that "Drexel has raised money for 
Lorenzo for years. This fits. Lorenzo would try to facilitate this." 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern strike began March 4 when 8,500 machinists began picketing that day 
after refusing to accept $125 million to $150 million in concessions. Pilots 
and flight attendants have overwhelmingly observed picket lines set up by the 
unions, forcing Eastern to cancel all but 10% of its flights. The company filed 
for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
code earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the machinists said they thought Lorenzo would be more 
receptive to selling to the Ueberroth group than to Icahn because Texas Air 
also owns Continental Airlines. If Ueberroth bought Eastern, it would become an 
independent entity and less of a threat to Continental, they said, compared to 
Eastern as part of an expanded TWA owned by Icahn. 
</P>
<P>
"Lorenzo has done everything he can to build up Continental and now is doing 
everything he can to protect it," said one of these sources. "That may or may 
not be in the best interest of Eastern, its creditors or Texas Air 
shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, the machinists' financial adviser, said if the Texas Air board agrees 
to a purchase by the Ueberroth group the unions would want to make sure that 
there were adequate "protective covenants" in the agreement. He said such 
covenants ought to include provisions that would prohibit asset sales and other 
actions that would endanger the continuing viability of the carrier and its 
employees' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists took the position before the strike began that there was no 
point in making concessions to Lorenzo because he had stripped the company of 
several of its most valuable assets in recent years and wanted to liquidate the 
company and create a situation in which Continental, his non-union airline, 
could become a bigger, profitable company. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone will have to come up with a lot of money to satisfy the bankruptcy 
judge" that a sale of Eastern is in the best interest of the company's 
creditors, said Nicholas Glaskowsky, professor of management and transportation 
at the University of Miami at Coral Gables. "It would amaze me why someone 
would even want to buy Eastern Airlines," he said. "I think there are a lot of 
people blowing smoke here." 
</P>
<P>
Along the same line, Raymond Neidl, an airline analyst with the New York 
brokerage house McCarthy, Crisanti and McCarthy, expressed doubts that an 
independent company would buy Eastern regardless of the price. "It is both a 
matter of price and the fact that the airline is highly leveraged," Neidl said. 
"I don't think Eastern is big enough to stand alone in this age of 
megacarriers." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a spokeswoman for America West said the Phoenix-based 
carrier had told Texas Air officials that it was interested in buying Eastern's 
northeast Air Shuttle. Earlier, Lorenzo had made a deal to sell the shuttle to 
real estate tycoon Donald Trump for $365 million. But after the strike began, 
Trump publicly announced that he wanted to lower the purchase price by about 
$125 million because he said the shuttle's value had diminished substantially 
as a result of the strike.

S&amp;L ASSETS WON'T BE DUMPED -- BRADY; 
</P>
<P>
SECRETARY SEEKS TO ASSURE PROPERTY OWNERS IN TEXAS, CALIFORNIA 
</P>

<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Tuesday sought to assure property 
owners in states such as Texas and California that federal regulators will not 
"dump" real estate on local markets when they sell the assets of insolvent 
savings and loan institutions under President Bush's S&amp;L rescue plan. 
</P>
<P>
On a one-day trip to Texas, one of the states hardest hit by S&amp;L failures, 
Brady said regulators "intend to proceed very carefully" when they begin 
selling property in order to avoid sending real prices of homes and commercial 
structures plunging. "The government also has a vested interest in avoiding 
dumping and (in) receiving the best possible price for the real estate," he 
said. "We won't necessarily be in a hurry to sell it off." 
</P>
<P>
Brady also warned Congress, which will begin work on the S&amp;L legislation 
next week, not to try to finance the whole $50-billion cost of the Bush 
Administration's S&amp;L rescue plan in a single up-front appropriation, as 
some lawmakers want, because that would risk blowing apart the effort to reduce 
the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
During a series of speeches and press conferences here and in Houston, Brady 
said to do so would push total government outlays far above the spending 
ceilings established under the Gramm-Rudman budget law and would "completely . 
. . render a sham the budgetary discipline" that the government is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
That in turn would send interest rates up sharply and push the government's own 
borrowing costs out of control, he contended. "If interest rates rise by as 
little as one-tenth of a percentage point," he said, it would "overwhelm any 
cost savings" that might come from financing the S&amp;L rescue package all at 
once instead of stretching it out over several years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Brady's concern over what Congress might do about the financing issue, 
the lawmakers are expected to act speedily next month to approve the 
Administration's S&amp;L rescue plan and most likely will make only minor 
changes. Those calling for Congress to appropriate the money in one action 
contend that it would save money on interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
A House Banking subcommittee is scheduled to start formal drafting of a bill 
next week, and the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee is 
scheduled to begin work on its version of the measure the week after. 
Congressional leaders say they expect to send a final version of the 
legislation to Bush's desk some time in May. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary's remarks were designed to head off any last-minute snags that 
might arise in congressional handling of the S&amp;L issue. Brady said later 
that, while he does not consider the financing issue a major one, he could "see 
it as (one) that could provoke endless debate" if it were permitted to get out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
He also warned that if lawmakers were to approve breaching the Gramm-Rudman 
spending ceilings for the S&amp;L rescue plan, it would open the door for 
exceptions in a variety of other areas, from increased spending on social 
programs to larger defense outlays. He called the proposal to appropriate the 
entire $50 billion in one fiscal year "a stupid idea." 
</P>
<P>
Brady's trip Tuesday was designed to promote the S&amp;L package in heavily 
affected Texas and to calm nervous property owners who are worried about the 
possibility that aggressive selling of S&amp;L assets might send local real 
estate values tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
On a related issue, Brady said the Treasury intends to stand firm against 
pressure from some lawmakers that it postpone the mid-1991 deadline, by which 
the Administration's plan would require savings and loan institutions to meet 
stiffer capitalization standards. 
</P>
<P>
Although some legislators argue that the deadline is unrealistically close, 
Brady contended Tuesday that the Administration's plan provides for granting 
exceptions to some troubled S&amp;Ls. But he said that any extensions should be 
allowed on a case-by-case basis. He argued that extending the deadline for all 
thrifts would only reduce the pressure on those institutions to put their 
economic houses in order.

BRAZIL STICKS TO ECONOMIC PLAN DESPITE SETBACK; 
</P>
<P>
EARLY REPORTS SHOW BIG INFLATION RISE IN MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A sharp increase in the cost of living has undermined the Brazilian 
government's latest plan for controlling inflation, but officials vow that they 
will press on with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The program of consumer price controls and government spending cuts, imposed 
Jan. 15, reduced inflation from an official monthly rate of 28.8% in December 
to 3.6% in February. But according to preliminary calculations for the month 
ending March 15, inflation resurged to between 6% and 7%. 
</P>
<P>
President Jose Sarney expressed "perplexity" this week at the March rate and 
warned that economic stability is important for strengthening Brazil's 
democratic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"If hyper-inflation defeats us, it is the institutions that will be the first 
victims," Sarney said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mailson Nobrega insisted that the March increase does not mean 
that the anti-inflation program, the so-called summer plan, has failed. 
"Although worrisome, it is not a threat," he told reporters Monday. "It was an 
accident along the way that should not repeat itself in the future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Spending Blamed 
</P>
<P>
The March inflation rate was strongly influenced by increases in rents, used 
car prices and other consumer costs that are not closely controlled, Nobrega 
said. In a television interview Tuesday, he promised tougher controls and 
added, "We believe we are correct and the results will appear." 
</P>
<P>
Mario Amato, president of the Industrial Federation of the State of Sao Paulo, 
blamed the resurgence of inflation on government spending. He said an increase 
of 22% in the monetary base since Jan. 15 "indicates that the government 
continues to spend more than it should." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the summer plan was a government pledge to eliminate its budget deficit 
if the Congress would approve personnel cuts. The Congress declined, however. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists say major causes of official overspending and persistent 
inflation are heavy payments on Brazil's $115-billion foreign debt and high 
domestic interest rates. In the past month the government has borrowed at 
monthly interest rates in the range of 20%. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest rates should have been contained from the beginning of the plan," 
economist Carlos Alberto Longo said. He said the March inflation rate of more 
than 6% is "proof that the plan did not work and that once again the workers 
are the losers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wages Negotiated 
</P>
<P>
A wage freeze included in the plan has raised waves of labor unrest and 
strikes. On Tuesday in Rio, bus drivers and train crews started a strike that 
left the city without its main means of public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Government, labor and business officials are negotiating the amount of a 
proposed wage increase that employers could pay without increasing consumer 
prices. The increase would be aimed at restoring the purchasing power that has 
been eroded from wages by inflation. Business leaders say the increase should 
be about 10%, while labor leaders are demanding 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Since it succeeded a military regime in 1985, Sarney's civilian administration 
has imposed three price control programs. After the failure of the second in 
1987, inflation soared to a record 934% in 1988 and economic output failed to 
increase.

GROWERS, GROCERS, STATE PLEDGE FOOD SAFETY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what was called a first-ever alliance, representatives of California 
grocers, growers and government vowed Tuesday to develop a food safety program 
to assure shoppers that the produce they buy is safe. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the program remain to be developed by a task force, which will meet 
for the first time Friday in Sacramento. But Don C. Beaver, president of the 
California Grocers Assn., said the goal is to provide consumers with "an 
implied warranty from the growers" that the fresh fruits and vegetables they 
bring to market are free of harmful chemical residues. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the purchasers for the consumers, and we want safe produce in our 
stores," Beaver said in Los Angeles, repeating a message delivered earlier 
Tuesday in Sacramento and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Jack C. Parnell, director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, 
which tests fresh produce for harmful residues, insisted that the state's food 
supply is "safe and always has been safe." But, he conceded, "there is a 
confidence crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Parnell, who has been nominated to the No. 2 post in the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, said the new program represents the first time "the three Gs -- 
grocers, growers and government -- have stood up together in attempting to 
warrant to consumers in California that we believe our food supply to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
However, one consumer organization that has been waging a campaign against 
pesticide use, citing harm to the farm workers who apply the chemicals, 
immediately dismissed the program as "empty rhetoric." The California Public 
Interest Research Group, or CalPIRG, called it "a major public relations 
strategy to regain consumer confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Beaver said the program would include financial support from the 7,000 retail 
outlets represented by the California Grocers Assn. Those funds would be used 
to increase inspection of produce "at the farm gate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supported by the farm groups, including Irvine-based Western Growers Assn., the 
program also urges government to require farmers to report use of all chemicals 
used on their crops. Growers and grocers also urged that violators of pesticide 
regulations be penalized "to the limits of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Buck, representing Western Growers, said the marketing group's 
farmer-packer members in California and Arizona are already reducing their use 
of chemicals. She cited statistics compiled by the Western Agricultural 
Chemical Assn. showing that use of farm chemicals dropped from 904.2 million 
pounds in 1977 to 634.4 million pounds in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Buck said growers are urged to adopt an "integrated pest-management" approach 
to protect their crops from insects, diseases, molds and weeds. Such an 
approach reduces use of chemicals in favor of introducing natural predators and 
the recently introduced technique of vacuuming bugs from such crops as 
strawberries and lettuce.

Oil prices retreated in active trading Tuesday after a sharp run-up sparked by 
a major Alaskan oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed the decline -- which included a drop of more than 2 cents a 
gallon for home heating oil -- largely on profit taking and concerns about 
whether OPEC ministers will ease production restraints during their meeting in 
Vienna this week. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West Texas 
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled at $19.91 a barrel, 
down 62 cents from Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The near-month contract had risen 38 cents a barrel Monday to close at $20.53, 
the highest level since Aug. 14, 1987, when it settled at $20.57. 
</P>
<P>
Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday, the April 
contract for wholesale home heating oil plunged 2.54 cents to 55.04 cents a 
gallon, after rising 1.06 cents Monday. 
</P>
<P>
April unleaded gasoline, which gained 1.73 cents in the previous session, 
settled down 1.07 cents to 58.68 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's rally was triggered by the accident off the Alaskan port of Valdez, 
where an Exxon tanker ran aground and spilled an estimated 10.1 million gallons 
of crude oil into Prince William Sound. The accident forced the closing of the 
port, temporarily cutting U.S. crude supplies by a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Beutel, an energy analyst at Elders Futures Inc., said the market sold 
off Tuesday because prices had risen too high, too fast in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the market was overbought," he said. "People are now cashing in." 
</P>
<P>
Also depressing oil prices were worries that the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries might loosen its production quota to help slow recent price 
increases at its regular meeting in Vienna.

DOUGLAS EXPECTS DELIVERY DELAYS TO WORSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas Aircraft has notified its commercial aircraft customers that delivery 
delays, which have plagued the McDonnell Douglas subsidiary for the past year, 
are expected to grow somewhat worse during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The firm announced Tuesday that because of a record backlog of orders, problems 
with rapid employment growth and various management changes, deliveries of some 
MD-80 jetliners from its Long Beach complex will be delayed about five to 30 
days this year. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Hood Jr., the recently named president of Douglas, said only three 
weeks ago that the delays had not grown any worse, but a new assessment has 
indicated that more aircraft than earlier thought will be delayed, company 
spokesman Don Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean that every airplane will be affected," Hanson said. "A lot of 
the aircraft going out of here have been delivered on time." 
</P>
<P>
Hanson did not have figures on how many additional airplanes will be late, and 
he declined to identify the affected airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Douglas delivered 121 MD-80s. The company builds 2 1/2 of the 
airplanes per week, which amounts to about 120 aircraft per year after 
deducting for holiday shutdowns. To make up for delays, however, the company 
must increase production above 2 1/2 per week. That means stepping up not only 
Douglas assembly but deliveries from thousands of suppliers all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
The delays are being exacerbated by a top-to-bottom management restructuring by 
Hood. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way you can go through major structural changes in your 
manufacturing process without some disruption," Hanson said. "We knew we were 
going to have to bite that bullet." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said it expects "significant long-term improvements" from the 
organizational changes. It added, "The new emphasis on quality . . . is 
expected to yield significant improvements for next year and beyond."

CITIES CALLED KEY TO NEW O.C. GROWTH PLAN

The Orange County Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted a growth-management 
plan Tuesday, but county officials said its effectiveness depends on cities 
imposing similar mandates to ensure that development does not outpace needed 
improvements in roads and other public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
And some officials raised the specter of holding back revenues from a proposed 
sales tax increase for transportation to any city that would not cooperate to 
control growth. 
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that cities in the county follow suit to strengthen our work on 
the county level and make this document (the county's plan) really work," said 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who last year appointed the 11-member citizens' 
panel that drafted the county's growth-management strategy. 
</P>

"It doesn't take a brilliant person to figure out that countywide solutions 
need countywide participation," former Supervisor Bruce Nestande, who chaired 
the citizens' committee, told the board Tuesday. "We don't have that right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jams to Affect Other Areas 
</P>
<P>
He said all cities must adopt such a plan or traffic that jams one community 
will back up into an adjacent area. 
</P>
<P>
The growth-management plan, adopted on a 4-0 vote, divides the county's 
unincorporated areas into five zones that will be closely monitored to ensure 
that new development does not outpace needed improvements in roads, libraries, 
flood control, and police and fire protection. Developers will be required to 
pay for needed public facilities before their commercial and residential 
projects are completed. 
</P>
<P>
The plan comes in the wake of last June's $2-million election battle over 
Measure A, the slow-growth ballot initiative rejected by voters, 56% to 44%. 
But the plan does not apply to the county's 28 cities. 
</P>
<P>
The only vehicle on the political horizon for persuading cities to cooperate 
with the county's growth-management strategy is the threat to deny 
county-controlled traffic improvement funds to the cities, county and building 
industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by a committee of the League of Cities' Orange County chapter calls 
for withholding revenue from a planned countywide sales tax increase from any 
city that failed to adopt specific growth-management policies, including strict 
traffic-flow standards at intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is led by Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young and Huntington Beach 
City Councilman John Erskine, who also is executive director of the Orange 
County Building Industry Assn., a politically influential group of builders and 
developers who generally favor adoption of a local sales tax to fund new 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande said the best way to get the cities to follow the county's lead is to 
tie revenues from the proposed half-cent sales tax to approval of 
growth-management plans. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move, Nestande said, would be a "test for those who really want good 
growth management in this county and really want to do away with the 
inconveniences and congestion they deplore. If they want it, they'll support 
this half-cent measure." 
</P>
<P>
Nestande was referring in part to slow-growth advocates who in June, 1984, led 
the successful effort to defeat a 1-cent countywide sales tax increase intended 
to help fund transportation projects, and partly to cities that have talked 
about growth management but have done little about it. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Nestande cited Irvine, which has several badly congested 
intersections that could back traffic up into adjacent unincorporated areas if 
Irvine fails to adopt growth-management strategy consistent with the county's 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande has advocated placing a sales tax before voters as often as necessary 
until it passes. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission has developed a 20-year, 
$11.6-billion spending plan based on a state law that requires such a plan 
before submitting a sales tax measure to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan focuses on completion of the massive Santa Ana 
Freeway-widening project, new car-pool lanes on existing freeways, and the 
initiation of new commuter rail services between Riverside and Irvine and 
between Los Angeles and several stops in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contra Costa Plan 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan and sales tax effort are being modeled after a similar 
package approved by Contra Costa County voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
But county supervisors have not yet approved plans for a sales tax election, 
fearing a repeat of June, 1984, when county voters rejected the 1-cent sales 
tax proposal by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
The growth-management requirements proposed for cities as part of the sales tax 
effort will not come before the League of Cities' general membership until 
April 20, and League Executive Director Bob Dunek said that some cities, such 
as Fullerton, have indicated objections. He said he has asked the cities to 
explain whatever reservations they have before the April meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that some cities are concerned about how this will affect 
redevelopment areas, in which they're trying to attract new development," Dunek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Young and Erskine were unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, has indicated he will support the growth-management language 
proposed by the league's subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Oftelie contends that the county's approach in dealing with cities is generally 
less punitive than has been the case elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County, for example, recently adopted rules that deny 
road-improvement funds to cities that fail to synchronize traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
"In Orange County, we give the cities some money to synchronize the signals, 
then we see if they do other things we have asked of them as well. We think our 
way is better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Oftelie acknowledged recently that the current policy has not prevented 
hundreds of instances in which the cities have failed to comply with the 
county's Master Plan for Arterial Highways, a document that is supposed to 
guide all road work. 
</P>
<P>
"Enforcement of the Master Plan has been in shambles for years," said Tom 
Matthews, an aide to Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who has 
persuaded some developers to pay for road work intended to fill gaps in major 
arterials in his district. 
</P>
<P>
And so part of the current debate among county officials concerns who should 
enforce the Master Plan -- Oftelie and his agency, the county Environmental 
Mangement Agency, which currently handles the task, or some new agency yet to 
be created.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: EXPERT SHARES HER CRAFT BY GETTING AMATEURS TO FEEL 
ACCOMPLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All her life, Nina Lee Mills has had a knack for making crafts. She has become 
so good at it that seven cities have hired her to teach crafts to their 
residents in 2-hour classes, two times a day, 7 days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm booked solid until the end of July," Mills said, and that includes classes 
in Los Alamitos, La Palma, Seal Beach and Garden Grove. The others are in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, 56, said she started making crafts as a hobby 25 years ago and hasn't 
stopped. "I heard you were good," she was once told while being interviewed for 
a crafts class job. "Yes I am," she replied, but not to boast. "When you spend 
as much time as I do on crafts and enjoy it, you really become accomplished at 
it." 
</P>
<P>
And the ease in making crafts is part of the message that she tries to get 
across in her classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can do what I teach in the class, and it doesn't take long," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her classes are filled with women, and Mills would like to see that 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the feeling men would feel they would be sissies if they took the 
class," she said. "But I don't buy that. I have an engineer from Douglas 
Aircraft that made things for his wife, and he thoroughly enjoys it. If more 
word got out to men, I know they would try it." 
</P>
<P>
Mills said that more young people are becoming involved in some of her craft 
projects, such as her class in painting sweat shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids go back to school wearing what they make, and that really makes them feel 
special," she said. "The idea of being involved in craft making will stay with 
them the rest of their life." 
</P>
<P>
Painting sweat shirts is her most popular class, both for young and old, but 
Mills said her classes for floral arrangements, basket decorating, statuary, 
quilted photo albums and Victorian Christmas decor are also full. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people who have a lot of leisure time and want to do 
something for themselves and have fun doing it," she said. "And a lot of people 
don't have money to buy the things they want, but they can afford it if they 
make it." 
</P>
<P>
Mills notes, for instance, that a person can buy six plain shirts and paint 
them for what it would cost to buy one painted by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
There is another reason some people take her classes. "There are a lot of 
people out there who want to meet other people," she said. "You'd be surprised 
how many friendships are made." 
</P>
<P>
Besides teaching, Mills spends about 80% of her free time working on her own 
crafts, which she sells out of a boutique in her Lakewood home. 
</P>
<P>
"I once thought of selling my crafts at swap meets, but it's too much of a 
hassle loading and unloading my work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Christopher Kenney, 16, will spend 2 weeks bicycling through 
California, stopping at elementary schools in Anaheim, Santa Ana, Huntington 
Beach, Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Irvine and Laguna Beach to talk about the 
dangers of drug use. It will be a 1,000-mile trip. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher decided to join the war against drugs after being surrounded by 
illegal substances at his junior high school in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., where he 
was raised. He has since moved with his father to Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in the sixth grade, they were selling drugs in the bathroom of my 
school," he said. "I thought it was wrong, and I want to tell people that this 
is not something they need to be involved in." 
</P>
<P>
He uses the theme: "Say Nope to Dope." 
</P>
<P>
This is the teen-ager's third 1,000-mile bike trip to talk about the evils of 
drugs. The trek will stretch from Reno to San Diego. "I've gotten a lot of 
support from corporate sponsors, and now I know how to teach the kids better 
and what I need to do it," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to give away T-shirts, buttons and movie passes during his stops, 
explaining that "it makes it fun for the kids and then they're more interested 
in what you have to say." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- The Fullerton Transportation Center was presented an award 
by the U.S. Department of Transportation for restoring and reusing three 
historic railroad depots and blending them into an activity facility. The award 
program recognizes exemplary solutions to transportation problems involving 
historic preservation issues, said Terry Galvin, manager of Fullerton's 
Redevelopment Agency.

GUNMEN SHOOT OWNER OF FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a fast-food restaurant in an unincorporated area near Anaheim was 
critically wounded after two gunmen entered his place Tuesday afternoon, the 
Orange County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Dak King Ling, 57, was shot once in the chest, with the bullet 
wound also causing stomach injury, Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard 
J. Olson said. Ling was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where a 
spokeswoman Tuesday night said his condition was critical. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said Ling is the owner of Hamburger Dan's in the 10900 block of Magnolia 
Avenue, where the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
The two holdup men, described as about 18 years of age, were armed with a 
semiautomatic handgun, Anaheim Police Lt. Jay Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the two escaped with an unknown amount of cash in a Chevrolet Nova.

BAIL SET FOR 2ND SUSPECT IN WAYNE-LUBY ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge set bail at $1 million Tuesday for Jeffrey Kendall Bouey, the second 
suspect arrested and charged with attacking the late John Wayne's daughter, 
Aissa Wayne, and her companion, Roger W. Luby, last October. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Municipal Court Judge Russell A. Bostrom denied a request by Bouey's 
attorney for a lower bail amount, pending a joint arraignment hearing set for 
April 7 with a second suspect, Jerrel L. Hintergardt, who is also being held 
with bond set at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, 37, of Burbank, was arrested by Newport Beach police March 17. 
Bouey, 35, of Simi Valley, was arrested Friday evening outside his home. Both 
are being held in the Orange County Jail on charges of conspiracy and assault 
with a deadly weapon in the Oct. 3 attack on Wayne and Luby at Luby's gated 
estate in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that Bouey is a friend of Hintergardt, who is a former employee of 
private investigator O. Daniel Gal of Los Angeles, for whom an arrest warrant 
was issued 2 weeks ago in connection with the attack. Gal had been questioned 
about the attack and is reported to be in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Gal's agency had been hired by Aissa Wayne's former husband, Thomas A. Gionis, 
an orthopedic surgeon from Pomona, as part of a bitter custody fight over the 
couple's 2-year-old daughter, Anastasia. Gionis won custody in January.

POLICE CATCH SUSPECT AFTER S&amp;L ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Fullerton police officers captured a suspect as he fled a Home Savings of 
America office with a bag of money Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Cecil Reece said Thomas Bradford Robinson, 34, of Orange was arrested 
in the parking lot of the Orangefair Mall following a brief chase on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Reece said police had received a call about a suspicious-looking person in 
front of Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan in Fullerton at 10:15 a.m. Moments later 
a similar call came in, reporting someone in front of Home Savings at 1107 S. 
Harbor Blvd. When the officers approached Home Savings of America, they saw a 
man running from the building. 
</P>
<P>
Police said he did not have a weapon but had simulated one during the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
While Robinson was being arrested, Huntington Beach police where responding to 
a bank robbery call at the Union Bank branch at 17122 Beach Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bill Mamilli said a man described by witnesses as Latino, about 5 feet 8, 
30 to 40 years old and with a heavy build, entered the bank about 10:40 a.m. 
and handed a teller a note demanding money. The man escaped on foot with an 
undisclosed amount.

NEW SNAG THREATENS TO DERAIL MONORAIL AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new snag threatens to derail the much-touted monorail transit system proposed 
for John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Realty Co., which has proposed building and paying for the 
$3.5-million monorail, has refused to finance the first phase of construction, 
a series of foundations or "footings" for the elevated track, in an apparent 
dispute with county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Company representatives said Tuesday that they won't pay for the work until an 
operating agreement covering such issues as insurance, liability and lease 
payments is reached with the company. That agreement is still under study 
because the county is analyzing a report on the monorail's impact on airport 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
"What the county wants is for us to send them a blank check and they'll send 
the agreement later," said Bob Young, president of McDonnell Realty. "Listen, 
that's crazy. We didn't just fall off the turnip truck." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Was Expected 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors had been expected to approve construction of 
the monorail foundations as part of a $22.9-million contract adopted by the 
board Tuesday to build a new parking structure at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
But board Chairman Thomas F. Riley announced before the vote that the monorail 
portion of the construction contract had been deleted because "McDonnell 
Douglas is unwilling to commit its funds." 
</P>
<P>
The action does not kill the monorail project as long as the county and 
McDonnell Douglas reach some sort of compromise by June 1, according to Tom 
Mathews, Riley's executive aide assigned to the monorail proposal. But after 
that date, Mathews said, "it becomes virtually impossible" because of cost to 
modify the expansion project at the airport to incorporate the monorail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
June 1 Deadline 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the point of no return is June 1," Mathews said in an 
interview after the board meeting. "Everybody has been put on notice that 
unless we have an agreement of sorts by that date, clearing the way for 
McDonnell Douglas to pay for those foundations, the project is in serious 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Riley firmly stated that the county is in no position to 
finance any aspect of the monorail project. The supervisors endorsed the 
monorail project last fall, principally because McDonnell Douglas offered to 
pay for the entire system. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has proposed building twin 23-story office and residential towers near 
the edge of the airport in Irvine and wants to run the monorail from the towers 
to the new airport terminal that is under construction. The trains in the 
system -- called a "people mover" -- would travel its half-mile in about 2 
minutes at a fare of 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the transit system were cheered 2 weeks ago when the project 
cleared a key hurdle. The city of Newport Beach had threatened to delay the 
airport expansion because of objections to the monorail proposal but withdrew 
its challenge March 13 after McDonnell Douglas agreed not to operate any 
airport terminal services, such as baggage-checking, at its office towers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big step, and a lot of people felt the project was rolling again," 
Kathie Rutherford, a county airport spokeswoman said. "Apparently, we still 
have issues to resolve." 
</P>
<P>
Preparation of an operating agreement has been delayed because the county is 
analyzing a recent report that concluded that construction of the monorail 
could cost the county-operated airport between $600,000 and $1 million in lost 
concession revenues, Rutherford said. The report, prepared by Aviation Planning 
Associates, said losses would result from travelers' riding the monorail to the 
McDonnell Douglas towers and spending money there on gifts, food and ground 
transportation rather than at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time to Study Project 
</P>
<P>
Before drawing up an operating agreement for the monorail, Rutherford said, the 
county needs time to study ways to recover those potential losses, such as 
special fees or taxes charged to McDonnell Douglas for operating the monorail 
on county property. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sold bonds to pay for the airport expansion, and we have an obligation 
to those bondholders to protect their investment," Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
Young of McDonnell Douglas said the Aviation Planning report "greatly 
exaggerated" the monorail's impact on food and concession sales at the 
terminal. And he said the firm is "expressly prohibited" from opening competing 
gift stores and concession operations at the Douglas Towers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have often wondered why nobody thought of the monorail idea before," Young 
said. "Now, we believe, someone else did but got tired of all of the 
frustrations they ran into trying to get it approved. It seems every time we 
turn around, somebody has got their hand out wanting this or that."

MARINE CLEARED IN HANGING DEATH OF HIS WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Toro Marine Corps sergeant has been cleared of charges that he strangled 
his wife, then hanged her body in the garage of the couple's Corona home last 
year to make it look like suicide, Marine Corps officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Charges of premeditated murder were dropped Monday against Gunnery Sgt. Murray 
D. Payne because of insufficient evidence. The action came after a yearlong 
investigation by civilian police and the Naval Investigative Service into the 
cause of death last May of Ella Mae Payne, 39. Her 22-year-old son found her 
hanging from the garage rafters. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, military prosecutors requested that the murder charge against 
Payne be dismissed. He was returned to duty while the recommendation was being 
studied by the investigating officer and the commanding officer of Payne's 
Marine Wing Support Squadron 373 at El Toro. He was officially cleared Monday, 
said Marine 1st Lt. Gene Browne, assistant public affairs officer at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"He has weathered the storm pretty well," said his civilian attorney, Kevin 
McDermott of Santa Ana. "There was never a doubt in my mind that he was 
innocent. I would not have hesitated a second to put him on the stand to 
testify." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Administrative Punishment 
</P>
<P>
McDermott said he fears that the military may now try to punish Payne 
administratively by discharging him from the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Payne) has requested that he be transferred to another facility so he can 
start over again," McDermott said, adding that the "whole thing" has cost his 
client dearly. 
</P>
<P>
"He lost his wife, his house, and he was jailed and the Marine Corps turned its 
back on him," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The case originally was investigated by Corona police and transferred to the 
Marine Corps in January. Payne was arrested Dec. 1 and jailed at Camp 
Pendleton. He remained there until January, when evidence at his Article 32 
hearing indicated that his wife could have killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspicious of Knot 
</P>
<P>
Police were suspicious of a complicated knot that formed the noose on the rope 
found around Ella Payne's neck. They said the knot was a military type and too 
complicated for Payne's wife to have tied. 
</P>
<P>
An initial autopsy conducted by the Riverside County coroner's office 
determined that Ella Mae Payne had died from hanging, and her death was 
declared a suicide. After a second autopsy on Ella Payne's exhumed body, a 
military medical examiner said her death could have been a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
The case was turned over to the Marine Corps because Payne was a Marine and 
Corona police officials said they believed Payne would get a quicker trial in 
the military justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Payne was the second Marine in Orange County last year to be charged with the 
murder of his wife.

LAGUNA TROLLEY REACHES TRAIL'S END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

After 11 summers of service, the "cable car on wheels" in Laguna Beach has worn 
out and county officials have decided that revenues and ridership were too low 
to justify the $135,000 replacement cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think the expenditure seemed warranted," said Tom Fortune, a 
spokesman for the Orange County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Officials plan to replace the distinctive blue trolley with a $60,000 open-air 
tram. The request for funds to replace the trolley, which had extensive rust 
and corrosion damage to the body, was denied Monday during a regular commission 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The "village trolley" and three trams were used to shuttle summer visitors from 
Laguna Canyon to festivals and activities throughout the city, said Terry 
Brandt, director of municipal services for the city. The system runs along 
Coast Highway, Laguna Canyon Road and other major streets to handle additional 
summer traffic, Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vehicle that people like to ride, so we wanted to replace it," Brandt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Repair costs were estimated at $11,000 to $55,600 and were not considered 
feasible, city officials said. The trolley has been out of service since last 
August, Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said the department would submit a new proposal for the cost of an 
additional tram Tuesday. The new request is expected to be on the commission's 
agenda on April 10, he said. Brandt expects the request to be approved and said 
the city should have a new tram to use this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Though they said passengers enjoyed the 50-cent trolley rides, sentiment didn't 
run deep among city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just another bus to us," said Loyola Lucero, who supervised the summer 
transportation system last year. It had no special missions and was used just 
like the trams, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she remembered that some people would let trams pass just to slide into the 
wooden seats of the blue trolley. "To (passengers) it was something fun to do," 
said Lucero, who has driven the bus herself on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
During the winter months the trolley was used for weddings and parades, Lucero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Patsy Weaver of Laguna Beach, who chartered the trolley for her son's wedding, 
said it would be "a shame" to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just very noticeable," she said of the trolley's appearance. She fondly 
recalled riding the trolley to get around town. 
</P>
<P>
"We use it all the time in the summer, because you can't get around without 
it."

NOT GUILTY OF MURDERING FRIEND'S BROTHER; 
</P>
<P>
ANAHEIM MAN CELEBRATES HIS RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After a jury found him not guilty of murder in the shooting death of his best 
friend's brother, Keith Roberts enjoyed his first full day of freedom Tuesday 
since his arrest in October. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a date tonight, and I think that's great," Roberts' mother, Pamela 
Spangrud, said Tuesday. "(Last night) he had a few beers. That was the first 
thing he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was found not guilty by an Orange County Superior Court jury in the 
slaying of John Valle. Jurors ruled Monday that Roberts acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred Oct. 16 during a party at an Anaheim house that Roberts 
and friends had rented. Roberts, who was recovering from a herniated disk, was 
in his room when Valle entered. The two argued, Roberts ordered him to leave, 
and a fight began. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts took out a .357-caliber magnum pistol and fired a warning shot into the 
floor. When Valle kept coming toward him, Roberts fatally shot him, he told 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a case that shouldn't have been filed," said Roberts' 
attorney, Deputy Public Defender Brian L. Ducker. "This was as clear a case of 
self-defense as you will ever see. . . . It's a travesty that he spent that 
much time in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Both Spangrud and Ducker said 5 months in jail, marked by a bout with 
pneumonia, hindered Roberts' recovery from his back injury. Roberts was also 
threatened by friends of Valle, Ducker said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Melvin L. Jensen said he was not "terribly pleased" with the 
jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Jensen argued against self-defense, contending that Roberts 
used excessive force and that he did not try to get help from people in the 
next room. 
</P>
<P>
"He was armed with a .357 magnum, which you might say is an equalizer, and he 
was also bigger," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Spangrud said her son's first priority is to get medical treatment for his back 
ailment. Then, she said, he will try to renew his friendship with Mike Valle, 
the dead man's brother. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Roberts) really feels bad about John," she said. "He knew the whole 
family, and he and Mike were very close. I think the two will make up because 
Mike knew what his brother was like. They all knew. He (John Valle) just wanted 
to cause problems."

THE PIECES ALL CAME TOGETHER FOR MISSION VIEJO'S MOORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joe-Max Moore's senior season with the Mission Viejo High School soccer team 
reads like a Hollywood movie script, or maybe even a fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, one of the smallest players on his team at 5-feet-7, 130 pounds, led the 
South Coast League in scoring with 25 goals and 10 assists and was named the 
league's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
His team held the No. 1 ranking in the boys' Southern Section 3-A all season 
and advanced to the 3-A final. There, Moore scored the winning goal on a 
penalty kick with three minutes left in the second and final overtime to give 
the Diablos a 2-1 victory over Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything happened the right way," said Moore, 18, The Times' player of the 
year. "It couldn't have been any better. Everything fell in the right place, 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The individual and team awards were all part of Moore's plans. While working 
out with weights over the summer, he set his sights on winning the 3-A title 
and league player of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has his sights set on a professional career in the United States or 
Europe. But first, he'll go to college. Moore said he has made an oral 
commitment to attend UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches there may hold him out of competition his freshman season to let him 
grow a little, Moore said. He has already grown a couple of inches his senior 
year and expects to grow taller than his 5-foot-10 father, Karl, who also 
matured late. 
</P>
<P>
Though small in stature, Moore's exceptional skills distinguish him as a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
His knowledge of the game, ball skills and, most of all, his high level of 
work, are the reasons for his success, Diablo Coach Cal Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of professional coaches and players talk about (giving) that 110%," 
Foster said. "He is one of those players giving you that plus, giving 
everything to make himself a better player and his team a better team. He's got 
a great desire and ability to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that he is one of those rare individuals who has a great shot at being 
on a national team and maybe making an Olympic team." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, in the meantime will stay close to the beaches of Southern California 
for his college career so he can continue to surf in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
He also enjoys riding dirt bikes. He got involved in motocross growing up on 
his parents' 80-acre spread in Oklahoma and now owns a Honda dirt bike that he 
takes to Riverside to kick up some dirt when he's not kicking a soccer ball.

FANS WELCOME MALARCHUK BACK AFTER HIS BRUSH WITH DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Clint Malarchuk of Buffalo got a one-minute standing ovation from his hometown 
crowd for just showing up and giving a wave before the Sabres' game last Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the fans were so glad to see the goaltender. The last sight they had 
of him was chilling. Last Wednesday night, during the first period of a game 
against St. Louis, the crowd of 14,448 had watched in stunned silence as 
Malarchuk knelt in the crease with blood gushing from a partially severed 
jugular vein. 
</P>
<P>
Uwe Krupp of Buffalo and Steve Tuttle of St. Louis had collided with Malarchuk 
and they all had slid back into the goal. But only Malarchuk was injured, 
apparently by a skate blade. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery to repair his neck injuries, which included a severed muscle, took an 
hour and a half. But he was well enough to hold a press conference the next day 
in which he broke down and cried when he talked about how close he had come to 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo Coach Ted Sator said: "There's a time in sport when winning and losing 
doesn't take precedence. I think the bottom line is that our medical staff 
might have safed a life tonight on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk said Friday night that he was confident he would be ready for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Bob Hall instructed David Courtney, Kings' director of media relations, 
not to announce that Marty McSorley had been assessed double game misconduct 
penalties for not leaving the ice when he was told to leave after the fracas in 
a game against Edmonton last week. 
</P>
<P>
McSorley didn't even hear about the double game misconduct until he was back in 
the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
So the officials didn't have to deal with reaction -- from him or the sellout 
crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
It took from Saturday night until Monday morning for the Kings to get a ruling 
from the National Hockey League on whether McSorley would be sitting out two 
games or three games because of his double infraction. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when Joel Otto of Calgary pinned referee Bob Finn, repeatedly pushing him 
back down to the ice, the Flames were told that night that Otto was suspended 
for just three games. 
</P>
<P>
NHL officials didn't even need to see tape of the incident to decide that the 
suspension should be three games and not, as many at the game expected, 20. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary Coach Terry Crisp is looking ahead to the playoffs, but he's not 
looking past his first-round matchup with Vancouver. Crisp went to Vancouver to 
scout the Canucks in a game against the Oilers last week while his players took 
a three-day bask in the sun in Newport Beach before a game against the Kings. 
Crisp told Vancouver reporters: "The Canucks aren't a surprise to us at all," 
said Crisp, giving no special credence to his team's 6-1-1 record against the 
Canucks. "We know how well they're capable of playing. . . . Take your stats 
and put them in a shredder, because they don't mean anything in the playoffs. 
The goals against, the goals for, the power play, the penalty killing, it means 
zilch. Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
After Jim Wiemer scored the winning goal for the Kings against the Oilers 
Tuesday night, Edmonton Coach Glen Sather was asked about the March 7 trade in 
which he sent Wiemer to the Kings. He bristled. "If there was any kind of 
advantage, I thought it would have been in our favor. He's 30 years old (28, 
really) and slow to the outside. He scored on a fluky goal. Big deal, it 
happened. It's certainly not going to make or break the season because Jim 
Wiemer scored a goal against us. It's not as if he's a superstar. What do you 
want me to say?" 
</P>
<P>
That slow, old Wiemer scored a goal in the Kings' next game, at Calgary, too. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a penalty called when Mark Hunter of the Flames hit New York 
Rangers defenseman Michel Petit with his stick in a game two weeks ago. But 
when Ranger General Manager Phil Esposito saw the incident on tape, he sent a 
copy to league headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
So the Flames are thinking about asking the league to look into Petit's slash 
on right winger Hakan Loob during the same game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Flame General Manager Cliff Fletcher: "Maybe we should hire somebody full 
time to look at every tape of every game played." 
</P>
<P>
In his first eight seasons in the NHL, Wayne Gretzky won the Hart Trophy as the 
league's most valuable player. Last year, Mario Lemieux won it. And it would 
seem that Lemieux, as the highest scorer in the league, would be Gretzky's main 
competition this season, too. But there seems to be a groundswell of support 
for Steve Yzerman, for playing so well and for holding his team together 
through the Bob Probert incident. 
</P>
<P>
It will be an interesting vote. If impact on the team is going to take 
precedence over points, though, the choice has to be for Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
There is one problem with Edmonton Coach Glen Sather's accusation that 
Gretzky's critical comments were an attempt to gain a psychological edge over 
the Oilers going into next week's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who took Sather to task for his part in the trade, made those comments 
in an interview with Jim Lampley last November and the syndicated program was 
first aired in Los Angeles last December, Lampley said. 
</P>
<P>
So much for Gretzky's timing. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
Paul Coffey, who played for years with Wayne Gretzky in Edmonton is still among 
the top scorers (sixth) in the league now that he's playing with Mario Lemieux 
in Pittsburgh. Coffey said: "It's pretty much like it was with Wayne. We seem 
to be developing the same kind of chemistry." . . . On Lanny McDonald's 500th 
goal, scored against rookie Mark Fitzpatrick, Flame goalie coach Glenn Hall 
said: "The kid shouldn't feel bad. Lanny beat him with a wrap-around shot off 
the post. That's tough to stop." . . . Teammate Joe Nieuwendyk was lined up 
behind McDonald in the runway to the ice as they waited to skate out to 
acknowledge being selected stars of the game when Nieuwendyk inched his way to 
the front. Some guessed that he was teasing McDonald, suggesting that McDonald 
would be the No. 1 star. "I just wanted to get out there onto our bench," 
Nieuwendyk said. "I wanted to see how the crowd would react for him." 
</P>
<P>
With each victory Calgary adds to its club record for most victories in a 
single season. It was 49. . . . In the fight for which Marty McSorley was 
suspended, teammate Igor Liba was holding onto the Flames' Gary Roberts when 
McSorley took a punch at Roberts. Roberts ducked and McSorley hit Liba right in 
the face. . . . The Islanders' fall from first place in the Patrick Division a 
year ago to last place is unprecedented since expansion brought on divisions in 
1967. . . . Calgary's Mike Vernon is the only goalie with three straight 30-win 
seasons. . . . Last season only Calgary won 30 or more games outside its 
division. This season Calgary is 31-10-5 against teams outside its division, 
Montreal is 30-10-6 and the Kings are 30-15-3. . . . Calgary's affiliate in the 
International Hockey League, the Milwaukee Admirals, has won eight straight and 
has set a club record with 50 victories.

COOMBS QUITS SANTA ANA FOR JOB AT CENTURY HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
COACH LEAVES AFTER EIGHT YEARS TO START BASKETBALL PROGRAM AT NEW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Greg Coombs, one of the most successful basketball coaches in Orange County the 
past eight years at Santa Ana High School, has resigned to assume a similar 
position at Century High School. 
</P>
<P>
Century High, also located in Santa Ana, is scheduled to open in the fall with 
1,000 freshmen and sophomores. The new school will offer technical training in 
computers and is expected to attract many top academic students from throughout 
the Santa Ana Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such an opportunity for me in all aspects of education that I wanted to 
be a part of the new school," Coombs said. "How many chances do you get to open 
a new high school?" 
</P>
<P>
Coombs, 32, became the youngest coach in the county when he was named coach at 
Santa Ana as a 24-year-old, after being an assistant at Sunny Hills. He 
compiled a 153-52 record at Santa Ana, winning four Century League titles and 
finishing second in the league three times. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana qualified for the playoffs seven times in eight years, missing the 
playoffs only in Coombs' first season. The Saints' best season was 1987 when 
they advanced to the Southern Section 4-A semifinals and finished with a 26-4 
record. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Santa Ana finished 19-8 despite no returning starters and with eight 
of its top 10 players underclassmen. Santa Ana has eight returning varsity 
players next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate leaving Santa Ana because that's the nicest group of players you could 
ever find," Coombs said. "I told the players today that change is inevitable in 
your life and that this was a great opportunity for me." 
</P>
<P>
Coombs will teach physical education and health science at Century. He said he 
will announce his assistant next month. 
</P>
<P>
Century High's gymnasium will be among the best facilities in the county with 
three full courts. The gym will feature two levels -- similar to Cypress 
College's -- with parking on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Century will play a free-lance schedule next year and then join a league the 
following season. The school's first senior class will graduate in 1992.

Ocean View High School's businesslike approach to baseball continued to pay big 
dividends Tuesday as the Seahawks defeated Westminster, 2-1, in a Sunset League 
game at Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive one-run victory in league play for Ocean View 
(10-3 overall, 2-0 in league play) after a 4-3 decision over Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"A typical Sunset League battle," said Steve Barrett, Ocean View's first-year 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. The last time the teams met in league play, Westminster 
rallied for a 7-6 victory to gain a share of the league title. Both teams were 
very vocal in that emotional game. Later, Westminster was forced to forfeit the 
victory for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the teams played in an atmosphere more suited for a library, but 
Barrett said the mood suited his team's style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"We take a quiet approach to the game," he said. "You won't hear much noise 
from the bench or the field. The players have taken a businesslike approach." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when first baseman Mike Burns 
singled and moved to third on a double down the left-field line by catcher 
Corey Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
Left fielder Scott Caringella drove in Burns with a sacrifice fly to center. 
Leadoff batter Steve Hernandez drove in the Seahawks' second run with a single 
in the fifth inning that scored Kevin Mullens. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster (8-3-1, 0-1) managed only two scratch hits off Ocean View starter 
Brent Woken through six innings before the Lions finally came to life in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Ryan Klesko opened the inning with a single and scored on a 
two-out double by shortstop Chris Larson. The Lions had the bases loaded after 
a single by catcher Angel Lopez and a walk to left fielder Mark Murphy, but the 
game ended when Jeff Fortune flied to left. 
</P>
<P>
"The intensity wasn't there until the seventh inning," said Ken Ostrowski, 
Westminster coach. "Emotion is a part of the game, and we didn't come alive 
until the seventh." 
</P>
<P>
Ostrowski sensed a letdown in Monday's practice after the Lions had averaged 
six runs per game in tournament play. Westminster also played without 
three-year starter Brian Stubbs, who was suspended Monday by the school's 
athletic council for breaking the athletic code last week. Stubbs, a pitcher, 
will sit out the first round of league play. 
</P>
<P>
It won't get any easier for Westminster this week with the Lions playing a 
makeup game against Marina on Thursday and then facing Fountain Valley on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Woken's performance was a big boost to Ocean View's staff, which has been 
relying heavily on sophomore Randy Karliner. Woken (1-1) appeared to be fully 
recovered from an ankle injury that had limited him to two starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good my last game against Mission Viejo when I pitched four shutout 
innings in relief," he said. "I didn't have much luck against Westminster last 
year, so hopefully things have changed." 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitcher Brett Grebe (4-1) was the only bright spot for Westminster 
despite losing for the first time. Grebe kept Ocean View's hitters off stride 
with a good curveball and had two of the Lions' five hits. 
</P>
<P>
In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 11, Marina 10 -- The Oilers held off several Marina rallies 
for the victory at Marina. Huntington Beach led, 7-2, but Marina came back to 
tie the score, 7-7, in the fourth. In the seventh, Chris Maher singled home 
Chris Mangels and Joe Kijewski to give the Oilers (5-5, 1-0) an 11-8 lead. In 
the bottom of the inning, Marc Newfield's two-run double pulled the Vikings to 
within one run, 11-10, with two outs. However, winning pitcher Josh Faurer got 
a groundout to end the game. The Oilers had nine doubles, including three by 
Mangels. Mangels, Chance Agnew and Ryan Marlin each had two RBIs. Newfield had 
three hits, including a solo home run, and three RBIs for the Vikings (0-1 in 
league play). 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 7, Edison 2 -- Steve Grack had two hits and four RBIs to lead 
host Fountain Valley (6-4, 1-1), which had five hits. Steve Montgomery (2-1) 
pitched the first five innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
In Pacific Coast League baseball: 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills 7, Laguna Beach 3 -- Jeff Carrao had two hits and three RBIs for 
the Mustangs (5-3, 2-0) at home. Trabuco Hills scored four runs in the fifth, 
two on a bases-loaded single by Carrao, to take a 7-3 lead. David Lowery (4-1) 
struck out seven for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 9, Costa Mesa 2 -- Laguna Hills starting pitcher Ron Kortman 
improved his record to 5-0, allowing just two hits over six innings. Mike Helm 
drove in four runs on two hits for Laguna Hills (10-3, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
In the Olympic League: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran 10, Santa Margarita 1 -- Mark Bredehoft had four hits, 
including a double, and five RBIs for visiting Orange Lutheran (4-6-1, 1-0). 
Doug Senne had three hits, and Todd Dudley and Mike Rossi had two each for 
Orange Lutheran, which had 15 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney 10, Capistrano Valley Christian 5 -- Kerry Langdale had a hit, scored 
two runs and stole a base for host Capistrano Valley Christian (5-4, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
In a nonleague game: 
</P>
<P>
Liberty Christian 10, Pioneer Baptist 5 -- John Van Dyke had three hits, 
including two triples, and three RBIs for host Liberty Christian (6-0). Mark 
Baltodano had two hits and an RBI for Liberty Christian, which scored five runs 
in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Buckels (3-0) had 12 strikeouts in six innings for the victory.

GIANT TUNA NOT BITING -- BUT SHARK SURE ARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas

<TEXT>
<P>
Long-range fishing trips in search of giant yellowfin tuna are in full swing, 
and thus far most of the trips have been memorable to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
That of the Polaris Supreme, which returned to San Diego last week from a 
16-day venture south, was no different. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw lots of cows (giant tuna), but they just weren't biting," said Mike 
Lettau, a crew member aboard the sportfisher. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently the sharks were. 
</P>
<P>
Houston resident David Billingsley, after hooking up with a giant tuna near the 
boat's stern, found out why his fight lasted only an hour: his 332-pound fish 
came up with about 40 pounds missing, courtesy of hungry sharks. "It was a 
bunch of small bites," Lettau said. 
</P>
<P>
Earl King fought his fish for 2 1/2 hours before crew members, looking down 75 
feet into the clear blue water, saw a large shark take one big chunk out of the 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
The fight ended immediately and King brought up a 336.8-pound tuna that Lettau 
said lost about 10 pounds to the shark. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the 18 anglers fishing Clarion Island, part of the Revillagigedo chain, 
caught just 80 yellowfin, but were kept busy with a tremendous wahoo bite, 
catching 270 of the slender but powerful game fish. "We were catching 40 or 50 
a day, every day," Lettau said. 
</P>
<P>
Entries are still being accepted for this weekend's Santa Monica Bay Halibut 
Derby, proceeds of which go to the Boys' Club of Santa Monica and the DFG-Los 
Angeles County Museum of Natural History Halibut Hatchery Project, which is 
working toward the release of thousands of hatchery-raised halibut into local 
waters. Information: (213) 450-5131. 
</P>
<P>
Saltwater fishermen tagged and released 124 of the estimated 642 striped marlin 
caught off the Southern California coast in 1988, according to recently 
released figures. An average of 800 striped marlin are caught in local waters 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Several piers took a beating during the powerful winter storms of 1988 and the 
Wildlife Conservation Board has voted to allocate funds for repairs of two 
popular fishing piers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hermosa Beach pier, its battered end closed for safety reasons, will 
receive $30,000; and the Port Hueneme fishing pier in Ventura County will get 
$200,000 for reconstruction of a section and minor repairs throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of two rivers in Eastern California would be taken into the state's wild 
and scenic river system under a bill introduced earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, authored by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), chairman of the 
Assembly Natural Resources Committee, also would ban dams and hydroelectric 
power stations on a third river in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Sher's bill seeks wild and scenic status under state law for 10-mile segment of 
the east fork of the Carson River in Alpine County, and 38 miles of the West 
Walker River in Mono County. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would forbid development along 53 miles of the McCloud River and 
one of its tributaries -- Squaw Valley Creek -- in Shasta and Lassen counties. 
The McCloud is a tributary of the Sacramento River. 
</P>
<P>
Five rivers were granted wild and scenic status by the state in 1972 under 
legislation signed by Ronald Reagan, the governor at the time. They are parts 
of the Eel, Klamath, Smith and Trinity rivers in Northwest California, and a 
22-mile segment of the lower American River near Sacramento. The five later 
were incorporated into the federal system during the Carter administration. 
</P>
<P>
Segments of four other rivers since have won wild and scenic status under 
federal law, but are not state-protected. 
</P>
<P>
They are the Tuolumne, Kern, Kings and Merced rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
DFG director Pete Bontadelli has been named winner of the 1988 Golden Trout 
Award by California Trout Inc. for being "the public official who has made the 
most distinguished and significant contribution toward the protection and 
improvement of wild trout, native steelhead and the waters that nurture them." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's 9th annual Day at the Docks, the West Coast's largest sportfishing 
industry get-together, attended by 35,000 last year, will run April 22-23 at 
H&amp;M, Point Loma and Fisherman's landings. 
</P>
<P>
Medical emergencies at sea will be the topic of discussion by Dr. Robert M. 
Kahn and the Assn. of Santa Monica Bay Yacht Clubs, with support from the Santa 
Monica Hospital Medical Center and Nethercutt Emergency Center and Sea Tek, a 
San Pedro powerboat rigging company. Program begins at 7 p.m. April 4 at King 
Harbor Yacht Club and April 11 at Del Rey Yacht Club in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG is offering a 73-page Guide to Artificial Reefs of Southern California, 
illustrating location, topography and marine resources living among the 22 
artificial reefs from Central California to San Diego County. Cost is $3 if 
bought at DFG's Long Beach office and $4 if purchased through mail: DFG Marine 
Division-K.M., 330 Golden Shore, Suite 50, Long Beach, Calif., 90802. 
</P>
<P>
A DFG census of bighorn sheep in the San Gabriel Mountains show the population 
to be healthy and stable, with 295 animals counted over a two-day period. An 
estimated 500-700 animals reside in the area, according to biologist Tom 
Paulek. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Marine Assn. is holding its first-ever boat show, featuring 
more than 200 boats in the water and on shore, April 20-23 at Channel Islands 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing information: 976-TUNA, the fishing information phone line, has expanded 
to include fresh water and Salton Sea reports, which will be updated every 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday. . . . A seven-week ocean fishing class, taught by 
Al Zapanta, begins tonight at 6:30 at Orange Coast College: (714) 432-5880.

FLUOR CORP. MAY SELL ITS 57.5% STAKE IN DOE RUN CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by interest from potential buyers, Fluor Corp. has hired two 
investment bankers to advise the Irvine-based firm on the possible sale of its 
57.5% stake in the profitable Doe Run Co., the nation's largest producer of 
primary lead. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said Fluor might be able to get as much as $250 million for its 
share of St. Louis-based Doe Run, which is owned jointly with Homestake Mining 
Co. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The New York investment firms S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. Inc. and Shearson Lehman 
Hutton will field "expressions of interest" for Doe Run, and Fluor will decide 
its plans for the company sometime this year, Fluor spokesman Rick Maslin said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Maslin said that Fluor began receiving inquiries from prospective buyers late 
last year, but that no written offers have been received. 
</P>
<P>
Doe Run was formed in 1986 when Fluor combined its lead operations with 
Homestake's. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Doe Run accounted for $124 million of Fluor's $5.1 billion in 
revenues. Fluor's share of Doe Run produced an operating profit of $29 million 
last year, compared with a loss of $6 million for 1987. Performance continues 
to be strong this year, Fluor President Leslie G. McCraw Jr. said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor has sold many of its commodities and mining businesses in recent years as 
part of a major restructuring begun in 1985 to diversify operations, which 
include international engineering and construction services. In 1987, Fluor 
sold its 90% share of St. Joe Gold operations and other gold properties for 
$500 million.

"They kept their lead business to turn it around. They've done that, and now's 
a good time to sell," said Tom Samuelson, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Inc., 
a research firm in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Doe Run, which produces about 60% of the nation's primary, or newly mined lead, 
has become profitable partly because of the cost savings of combining 
operations of Fluor and Homestake, Fluor has said. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects for lead demand are "flat," especially for the car battery 
market, which is where most Doe Run lead is used, Samuelson said. Lead demand 
has steadily declined in recent years because of federal concerns about lead's 
safety in consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
Homestake, which is predominantly a commodities producer, is one possible 
candidate to purchase Fluor's share of Doe Run, Samuelson said.

ALMANAC: COST OF OFFICE SPACE IN COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH VACANCY BRINGS IT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A list of things that cost less now than they did 3 years ago might be pretty 
short -- especially if it was limited to Orange County items. 
</P>
<P>
However, the price of at least one thing has dropped here: rented office space. 
</P>
<P>
According to Coldwell Banker, the county's average monthly lease rate per 
square foot of vacant existing office space was $1.65 in the fourth quarter of 
1988. That's 2 cents less than the average rate in the fourth quarter of 1985, 
and 8 cents lower than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
A big reason for this inflation-defying trend is the large amount of vacant 
office space here. The office vacancy rate for the 1988 fourth quarter was 
21.7%, up from 15.1% about 4 years ago, Coldwell Banker reported. A building 
boom that helped to produce all that empty space continues, with 3.6 million 
square feet of space under construction. Existing space totals 45.4 million 
square feet, Coldwell Banker said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar had the highest average lease rate in the county, $2.25 per 
square foot. Bargain hunters should head for Fountain Valley or Yorba Linda, 
where the average is 95 cents.

CHINA TIGHTENS UP ON CASHMERE EXPORTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese authorities are taking action to restore order to the international 
trade in cashmere, one of the world's most luxurious fibers. 
</P>
<P>
The cashmere trade has been in crisis for more than a year because of the 
attempts by China, which produces almost all of the world's cashmere, to 
liberalize its internal trading system as part of its economic reform program. 
</P>
<P>
The knitwear groups of Scotland and Italy have found it increasingly difficult 
to secure supplies of cashmere, which is made from the fleece of goats living 
on the mountains of Inner Mongolia, and consumers have had to pay more than 
ever for the end products. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities have recently attempted to regain control of the market 
by restricting exports to a small number of licensed exporters. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reform program, Chinese authorities relaxed their central controls to 
encourage free enterprise, leaving European knitwear mills, accustomed to 
stable prices and secure supplies, faced with unpredictable pricing and sudden 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, quality control of China's cashmere exports declined, and 
European mills found sheep's wool and mud in shipments. 
</P>
<P>
These problems were compounded by China's attempts to increase its involvement 
in the more profitable business of cashmere processing. Traditionally, the 
Chinese have exported raw cashmere to be processed into yarn in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Cashmere is very delicate and the process of de-hairing and spinning elaborate. 
The new Chinese processing plants were inexperienced and consignments arriving 
in Europe were often too damaged to be used in luxury knitwear. 
</P>
<P>
The Scottish and Italian mills were forced to pay premium prices to secure 
emergency supplies of cashmere of the correct quality. Dawson International, 
the Scottish knitwear group and the world's biggest user of cashmere, estimates 
that it spent the equivalent of $3.4 million in tackling supply problems last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Cashmere prices in the shops rose by a fifth last autumn and have risen by 
about the same amount this spring. Rises have been marked in the United States 
where the decline of the dollar against the pound and the lire has exacerbated 
the effect of the problems in China. Dawson's most expensive cashmere piece -- 
part of a collection by Oscar de la Renta, the New York fashion designer -- now 
costs $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted by chaos in the Chinese market, the European mills have attempted to 
establish alternative sources of cashmere supplies. They have invested in goat 
farms all over the world, from Australia to Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
China is still the chief source of cashmere supplies. The more modern growers 
are involved in artificial insemination and cross breeding. But nearly half 
China's cashmere still comes from goats herded by peasants in the remote 
mountains of Inner Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
If China's attempts to regain control of the cashmere trading system succeed, 
the European knitwear mills can at least expect more stable pricing and secure 
supplies. But the Chinese are still committed to increasing their involvement 
in processing, and the world cashmere trade will never be quite the same again.

TIFFANY'S AGAIN SHINES IN POST-AVON ERA;

JEWELRY FIRM RESTORES INVENTORY CONTROL, EARNINGS STRENGTH

<P>
Don't ask for a discount if you're shopping at Tiffany's. President Lincoln 
didn't get one when he bought a pearl necklace for Mary Todd Lincoln back when 
the 151-year-old firm was still a fledgling. 
</P>
<P>
And forget about sales; there aren't any at Tiffany's. 
</P>
<P>
High-quality merchandise and better control over inventory are now the 
hallmarks of the fine jewelry store whose name is synonymous with good taste. 
And on the subject of good taste, don't ever expect to find men's diamond rings 
at Tiffany's counters. 
</P>
<P>
"We listen and we watch the market. But we still don't sell men's diamond 
rings," says Tiffany &amp; Co. Chief Financial Officer Thomas Andruskevich in 
drawing the line that Tiffany sets to accommodate different tastes. 
</P>
<P>
The company's earnings rose a hefty 54% in 1988 and its fourth-quarter sales 
were up 20%, the 12th consecutive quarterly gain. But the picture was not so 
rosy nearly five years ago when Avon Products Inc., which bought the company in 
April, 1979, decided to put it up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Andruskevich, who came from Avon to Tiffany's in 1982, remembers the dark days. 
"Tiffany's was supposed to become Avon's flagship of specialty retailing," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"When Avon took control of Tiffany's, they moved their customer focus downscale 
in the attempt to enlarge their customer base and, in turn, their profits," 
said Harry Ikenson of S. G. Warburg &amp; Co., who follows retailing stocks. 
"But they lost the old customers and didn't make it with new ones." 
</P>
<P>
The company was also plagued with a revolving door of leaders after the 
departure of Walter Hoving, who had led the company from the 1950s, and before 
current Chairman William Chaney, who had been a president at Avon, came in. 
</P>
<P>
Chaney eventually led a leveraged buyout of the company in October, 1984, and 
concedes that the changes made in the post-Avon era could have been undertaken 
sooner.

PENTAGON HDTV PROJECT RAISES PROTECTIONISM FEARS

<P>
The Japanese electronics industry is concerned about what it feels may be U.S. 
protectionist moves against the fast pace of high-definition television 
development in Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is reportedly leading Western countries in research and development of 
HDTV, deemed to be the television technology of the 1990s, and has already 
proposed setting up international unified standards on an HDTV system. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese electronics industry officials say they are worried that a recent U.S. 
move to shut foreign firms out of an HDTV project led by the U.S. Defense 
Department could put a damper on worldwide research and development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the HDTV promotion center of Japan's Trade and Industry 
Ministry said it was "difficult to understand" Washington's aim, recently 
indicated by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, to exclude technologically 
superior foreign makers. 
</P>
<P>
Such moves to block a major Japanese electronics firm, one of the world's 
leading HDTV developers, would "not be a plus factor" for U.S. firms, the 
spokesman said, but would only bolster their fears about Japanese and European 
superiority. 
</P>
<P>
In early March, Mosbacher indicated in a congressional hearing that the 
Pentagon should not allow foreign makers to join a $30-million HDTV development 
plan financially supported by the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sony Corp. Affected 
</P>
<P>
Among those that would be affected by Mosbacher's suggestion are Japan's Sony 
Corp., which has been engaging in the HDTV development for more than a decade, 
and N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, electronics industry sources here said. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling U.S. reservations against foreign competition, the sources added, are 
concerns that participation of Japanese firms in the Pentagon's HDTV efforts 
would be to the detriment of American companies. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. industry reportedly also is worried that Japanese and European makers plan 
to display HDTV products using their own standards at an international HDTV 
conference, probably to be held in Moscow this summer, say industry sources 
here. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. electronics and defense industry experts are concerned that Japanese and 
European HDTV know-how would be used for military purposes, posing a threat to 
U.S. security, the Japanese feel. 
</P>
<P>
A trade ministry official, requesting anonymity, said U.S. worries were 
"premature." The official stressed that collaboration between Japan and the 
United States was needed to develop HDTV and that multinational standards would 
be "desirable." 
</P>
<P>
A Sony spokesman said his company intends to take no action for the time being 
and will watch the situation regarding its participation in the Pentagon-led 
HDTV development project. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that if U.S. authorities eventually decided to completely shut 
out Sony America Corp., which has more than 30 years of business history in the 
United States, from the joint development project, it would seriously hamper 
HDTV development in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He said that American industry would have to start "virtually from scratch" and 
it would not stand to gain by excluding foreigners.

CALIFORNIA PLAY FESTIVAL TAKES A NEW YORK DETOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first California Play Festival got off to a low-key -- some might say 
lukewarm -- beginning Monday at South Coast Repertory with a staged reading of 
a comic work-in-progress about several aging New York yuppies caught up in a 
heartfelt search for love. 
</P>
<P>
The opening scene of Jeremy Lawrence's "Romantics" unfolds in a Manhattan 
singles bar where Peter, a melancholy kind of guy, meets J.D., a melancholy 
kind of gal who finds a lot of things "just this side of depressing" -- one of 
her favorite refrains, along with "I'm not meeting anybody today." 
</P>
<P>
Peter gets the biggest laugh when he reveals that he doesn't feel nearly as 
lucky as a writer friend of his who made a bundle on a book called "Memphis 
Meshugenah," which is about growing up Jewish and gay in the industrial South 
and was almost made into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
It is that kind of scene in that kind of play. (And we thought this theater 
company looked down its nose at Neil Simon.) 
</P>
<P>
The next scene takes place at an unidentified beach on Long Island, doubtless 
somewhere in the Hamptons. Unfortunately for Peter's friend Brad, who is not a 
melancholy kind of guy, Susan, the gal he has brought around to the beach 
house, "has forgotten how to laugh." Literally. She gives an actual 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Susan is not searching for love, by the way. She is searching for meaning. But, 
as someone says of her, she is the kind of philosopher who would "own the 
complete Shirley MacLaine." That got a very appreciative laugh from the 
half-filled theater. 
</P>
<P>
A more trenchant line in that scene, which all true Manhattanites can 
appreciate, had to do with a cacophonous panhandler in the 72nd Street subway 
station who bombards subway riders on his electric piano and says: "Like it or 
not, I'm part of your life." 
</P>
<P>
Did we say this was the launch of the California Play Festival? We took SCR 
literary manager John Glore's word for it. He introduced "Romantics" as 
CalFest's "kickoff event" and promised much more like it. (Let us hope not. We 
would rate the material as something of a touchback.) 
</P>
<P>
In fact, we can guarantee the festival's spiritual geography will change when 
Marlane Meyer's black comedy "The Geography of Luck" has its world premiere May 
16 on the Second Stage. If that production is anything remotely like its staged 
reading at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in February, theatergoers will 
discover the meaning of real belly laughs. 
</P>
<P>
SCR insiders also vow that Beth Henley's "Abundance," which will have its world 
premiere April 21 on the Mainstage, will deepen the CalFest terrain. And Robert 
Daseler's "Dragon Lady," which will bow May 6 on the Second Stage, is described 
as "absolutely Californian." 
</P>
<P>
But, like it or not, back to the searing soap-opera world of those romantic New 
Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
Did we say that Peter has been living with Betsy for 20 years? She is a 
tolerant sort of gal, able to overlook Peter's affair with J.D. As Betsy says: 
"Peter and I have a shared horizon." Or, as Peter tells Brad, who is about to 
marry Morgana: "I guess sometimes people have to love each other." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, as J.D. says, "options are the curse of modern romance." And 
wimpy platitudes, at least at this stage of Lawrence's writing, are the curse 
of "Romantics." 
</P>
<P>
'ROMANTICS' 
</P>
<P>
A staged reading of "Romantics" by Jeremy Lawrence was directed by Eli Simon on 
the Mainstage at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. With Marcia Firesten, 
Robert Schenkkan, Joan McMurtrey, Michael Canavan, Heather Lee and Katie 
Mitchell. Casting by Martha McFarland. Dramaturgy by John Glore.

<TEXT>
<P>
David Andruss, 19, of Anaheim was a dual winner at the ninth annual Young 
Keyboard Artists Assn. International Piano Competition, March 19 to 25 at 
Chapman College in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Andruss won a Young Chang 7-foot grand piano valued at $15,000, plus $500 in 
cash for winning the concerto division, in which he played Prokofiev's First 
Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
He also won the first-place award -- and $500 -- in Division 6, for pianists 18 
to 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The junior winner in the concerto division was Stacey Su, 12, from Fresno, who 
played Prokofiev's Third Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Su won $300 and a future performance with the Pacific Symphony. The date of the 
concert has not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners in Division 6 included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clara Bohr, 18, from Omaha, Neb., second place and $300. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Helen Wu, 18, from Irvine, third place, $200. Wu also captured second place 
in the senior concerto division. 
</P>
<P>
The competition drew an initial enrollment of 550 contestants -- ages 5 1/2 to 
20 -- from 19 Western states, China and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
About 332 musicians took part at Chapman College in six divisions, according to 
age and a two-tiered concerto competition. CHRIS PASLES

The spiritual leader of the Brussels Mosque and his aide were shot and killed 
today, police said. The attack followed threats on the Muslim leader prompted 
by his comments about Salman Rushdie and his book "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Imam Abdullah Ahdal, a 36-year-old Saudi, and his aide, Salem 
Behir, 40, of Tunisia. No arrests were made and no one claimed responsibility 
for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
The imam received threats after he made a statement on Belgian television about 
Rushdie, police said. A television reporter said the station received angry 
telephone calls after Ahdal's Feb. 20 appearance. Although Ahdal's remarks were 
considered moderate, the reporter said, he condemned the British author's book.

2 MEN FOUND DEAD IN GRIFFITH PARK, RAISING BODY COUNT TO 5 IN 10 DAYS

<P>
The bodies of two men were found Tuesday night in a van parked on a lonely 
stretch of road in Griffith Park, police reported this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the cause of the deaths was not immediately determined. The 
victims -- both apparently in their mid-30s -- were discovered at a turnout on 
Vista Del Valle Drive by two park rangers on routine patrol. One victim was not 
immediately identified. The other's identification was withheld pending 
notification of next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery brought to five the number of bodies found in remote areas of 
Griffith Park, the nation's largest urban park, in the past 10 days.

President Roh Tae Woo ordered 49 top generals transferred or retired after army 
hard-liners criticized him for seeking ties with Communist nations and not 
suppressing dissidents, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Roh, a former general who played a key role in the military's seizure of power 
in 1980, replaced several hard-liners in key security posts with generals loyal 
to him, according to Korean press reports. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the generals being replaced were allies of former authoritarian 
President Chun Doo Hwan. Defense Ministry officials declined to say how many of 
the 49 generals would be retired and how many moved to other posts.

President Bush said today he will send Congress "in the next few days" his 
specific recommendations for pay hikes for top federal officials, members of 
Congress and judges. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made the commitment as the private National Commission on Public Service 
suggested raises of about 50% over two years for federal officials, virtually 
as high as the increases that Congress killed amid a public outcry in February. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bush nor White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated what Bush's 
recommendation would be, but Bush is known to favor some sort of raise. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which has former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker as 
its head and former President Gerald R. Ford and former Vice President Walter 
F. Mondale among its 36 members, also suggested pay increases for lower-ranking 
government workers.

Two Czechoslovakian teen-agers who wanted to go to the United States shot their 
way aboard a Hungarian airliner in Prague and forced it to fly to the West, 
officials and media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
But they freed their hostages -- including a Hungarian diplomat -- and 
surrendered after landing here when U.S. military authorities blocked the plane 
from entering the adjoining Rhein-Main Air Base, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Injuries 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported among the 10 passengers and at least four crew 
members aboard the hijacked Hungarian plane when it reached Frankfurt, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had released 82 passengers at Prague airport after speaking with 
Lajos Taba, the Hungarian consul-general, the Hungarian news agency MTI said. 
It said Taba traded himself for the passengers and was among those freed in 
Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
The youths -- aged 15 and 16 -- surrendered less than three hours after seizing 
the Soviet-made Tupolev-154 owned by Hungary's Malev Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The hijackers, who were armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle and carried 
a fake hand grenade, gave up at Frankfurt Airport when U.S. officials prevented 
the plane from taxiing onto the adjoining U.S. military base. 
</P>
<P>
A witness said the youths stormed into a Prague airport lounge located near 
boarding gates and started shooting before commandeering the plane. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hit by the gunfire but a policeman fell to the ground, the witness 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two youths were being questioned by police.

A man accused of killing a detective during a drug raid cannot be tried because

Superior Court Judge Charles M. Grabau dismissed the murder charge against 
Albert Lewin, 33, ending a case that has raised questions about whether police 
routinely lie in obtaining warrants. 
</P>

"A fair trial is not possible," the judge told a jammed courtroom. "The conduct

KAREEM GETS $500 FINE FOR SHOVING FAN

Laker center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, found guilty last month of two misdemeanor 
charges stemming from an incident with an Italian tourist at a shopping mall 
last April, was fined $500 this morning in Phoenix Municipal Court and ordered 
to pay $840 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, flanked by his attorneys and receiving a police escort into court 
and to a waiting limousine, waived his right to appeal and spent only six 
minutes in court before leaving without speaking to a dozen reporters in a 
packed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John L. Wiehn fined Abdul-Jabbar for shoving a camera in the face of 
Fernando Nicolia, a tourist from Italy who was taping the Laker center with a 
home video camera at the Metrocenter shopping mall in north Phoenix on April 
21, 1988. Nicolia said he suffered a bruised eye and a scratched ear from the 
force of the shove from the 7-foot-2, 267-pound Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix prosecutor told the judge that Abdul-Jabbar's actions against the 
5-foot-9 fan was "like a mismatch in basketball." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's contention was that the incident involving Abdul-Jabbar was 
an intentional action, not a reflexive one, as the defense had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
During the proceeding, Abdul-Jabbar was called before the bench and answered 
Wiehn's questions mostly with one-word responses. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence that could have been imposed was 10 months in jail and a 
$5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
A civil suit filed by Nicolia is pending although attorneys for Abdul-Jabbar 
are trying to settle out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Armato, Abdul-Jabbar's attorney, said he and his client were happy that 
the case has been concluded but were upset that it came to trial.

OLYMPIC GAMES IN SEOUL MADE $479-MILLION PROFIT

The 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul made a record profit of $479 million, 
more than double that of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, organizers said today. 
</P>
<P>
The figure was about $125 million more than estimates announced by organizers 
right after the Summer Games ended. 
</P>
<P>
The Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee disclosed the figure in a final report 
today, preceding its disbandment next week. 
</P>
<P>
The $497-million profit for the Seoul Olympics, the largest Games in Olympic 
history, eclipsed the record $223-million profit posted for the Los Angeles 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Seoul's final tally put revenues at $987.5 million, with expenditures of $847.7 
million, yielding a book profit of $139.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
But in line with international practice, the official balance sheet did not 
include cash contributions from individuals and social and business groups, 
which amounted to in excess of $300 million, committee officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, observers doubted that the Seoul Games actually generated a profit for 
South Korea because the balance sheet does not include an estimated $1.5 
billion the South Korean government spent on building or expanding stadiums, 
roads, subways and other facilities. Government officials say a number of the 
major projects were already planned under a long-term city development program 
before Seoul was awarded the 1988 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
SLOOC officials said they have not decided what to do with the profit, but one 
senior official, who declined to be identified, said most of the money would be 
spent for promotion of sports activities.

After months of negotiations, city officials and the Phoenix Suns have reached 
a tentative agreement to build a $60-million, multipurpose downtown arena that 
could be ready by the 1991-92 NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
Suns President Jerry Colangelo said at a news conference Tuesday night that the 
City Council will vote on the proposal April 18. "If the vote is positive, we 
can break ground by December of this year and be in our new arena for the 
1991-92 season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns have played all of their 21 NBA seasons at the 14,471-seat Arizona 
Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Colangelo said the new arena, to be built near 
Symphony Hall and Jefferson Street in downtown Phoenix, will seat 18,500 and 
have up to 120 luxury skyboxes.
