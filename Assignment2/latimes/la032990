KARL BROWN; PIONEER IN CINEMATOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karl Brown, whose career as cinematographer, scenarist and director spanned the 
formative and most technically significant decades of film industry history, 
has died at the age of 93. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time actor for D.W. Griffith, who served as an assistant cameraman on 
Griffith's epic "Birth of a Nation," later helped craft the miniature 
projection process that made possible such pictures as "King Kong." 
</P>
<P>
Brown died Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland 
Hills, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Pennsylvania to stage performers, he went to work in New York City 
while in his teens for Kinemacolor Co., the first successful producer of color 
movies. The firm moved to Hollywood and soon went broke, but Brown opted to 
remain here and, with an old view camera he purchased at a downtown pawn shop, 
became a still photographer on the 1914 film "The Spoilers." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith had recently moved his company to the West Coast, and Brown persuaded 
the legendary director's cinematographer, G.W. (Billy) Bitzer, to put him on as 
an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
He worked on "Birth of a Nation" and "Intolerance," Griffith's two acclaimed 
historical extravaganzas. By then Brown was experimenting with optical effects 
and created a double-printing technique that gave a supernatural radiance to 
Christ in "Intolerance." 
</P>
<P>
In "Broken Blossoms," the 1919 Lillian Gish melodrama, Brown crafted the 
miniature shots of the Limehouse area which open the Griffith picture, 
according to a 1962 article in American Cinematographer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
He became a director of photography for the 1923 epic Western "The Covered 
Wagon," where his snowy scenes of the Snake River Valley in Utah and Nevada are 
still considered among the most aesthetic moments in early film. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, he also began to write screenplays while continuing as 
cameraman. Through the 1920s, his credits included "Brewster's Millions," "One 
Glorious Day," "Ruggles of Red Gap," "Merton of the Movies" and "The Pony 
Express." 
</P>
<P>
He developed an interior lighting system using acetylene lamps and employed it 
in "Stark Love" for Jesse Lasky and Adolph Zukor at Paramount and directed "His 
Dog" for Cecil B. DeMille in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
But he called directing "the worst job in the world" and returned for a time to 
his camera and special effects lab. 
</P>
<P>
At RKO he was hired to create a process in which miniature models of 
prehistoric animals were projected onto the screen as exaggerated monsters. The 
film was "Creation," which was never completed because it had gone over its 
$300,000 budget. But the process remained and was used later in the 1933 "King 
Kong" and future adventure pictures. 
</P>
<P>
He either wrote, photographed or directed "The White Legion," "Prince of 
Diamonds" and "Flame" in the early 1930s and collaborated on the script of 
"Tarzan Escapes" in 1935, at $1.7 million one of the most expensive films of 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
From 1939 to 1945 he concentrated on writing and created or adapted 18 
low-budget features for Columbia, Republic and Monogram. Many of them featured 
Boris Karloff as a surgeon or mad scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also wrote novels ("Incorrigible" and "The Cup of Trembling") and a book 
of film history ("Adventures With D.W. Griffith"). His final writing credits 
before retiring were scripts for such TV series as "Death Valley Days." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, the actress and aviator Edna Mae Cooper, died earlier. There are no 
known survivors. Brown had asked that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made 
to the Motion Picture and Television Fund.

WHAT IF GORBACHEV FAILS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev is the most outspoken of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's conservative 
critics. He may also be the cleverest. A highly visible member of the 
Politburo, Ligachev has carefully distanced himself from the reactionaries who 
pine for the old days of rigid and centralized rule. He is shrewd enough to 
acknowledge past leadership errors that produced economic stagnation. He 
deplores the Communist Party's loss of moral authority. But his chief worry, he 
says, is that Gorbachev's perestroika has made matters far worse by trying to 
do too much and by failing to maintain necessary controls. The result, Ligachev 
told Times correspondent Michael Parks, is that the Soviet Union could be 
headed for political and economic chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev's is not a lonely voice. He and other conservatives may have been 
outmaneuvered by Gorbachev in the party's highest echelons and outvoted in 
elections where free choice has been allowed. But they are not without a 
significant constituency, especially among those in the military, the KGB, the 
party and the bureaucracy who fear Gorbachev's reforms will cost them their 
jobs and their perquisites. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev doesn't overtly cater to this self-interest. Instead, he presents 
himself as a man of principle, irrevocably opposed to any economic change that 
would allow private industry employing hired labor. In that regard he speaks 
for the ideological hard-liners who bitterly resent the dilution of the party's 
authority and its impending loss of monopoly power. There's no question that 
Ligachev stands ready to lead a retreat from perestroika if Gorbachev falters 
and fails. 
</P>
<P>
What's the case against Gorbachev? It helps Ligachev's credibility that under 
perestroika conditions in many cases have in fact become worse. The slackening 
of official restraints has seen long-suppressed but never-eradicated ethnic 
tensions erupt with a vengeance. Economic conditions have generally 
deteriorated since Gorbachev came to power five years ago. Per capita income 
and productivity are down, inflation has soared, consumer goods remain scarce. 
Ligachev puts the blame squarely on Gorbachev for failing to understand the 
nature of the genie he was releasing from the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Most disturbing, in the view of Gorbachev's critics, perestroika has set loose 
centrifugal forces of secessionism that are tearing at the country's outer 
edges. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe has produced hardly a ripple 
of concern in Soviet military or political circles. But the possible loss of 
territories long held to be intrinsic parts of the Soviet Union, whether in the 
Baltic states, the Ukraine or Georgia, is perceived as a fundamental and 
intolerable threat. 
</P>
<P>
The West wishes Gorbachev well, not least because an inward-looking and 
modernizing Soviet Union is the best hope for continued peaceful relations 
between the great powers and inside Europe. But perestroika's -- and 
Gorbachev's -- success and survival aren't a given. The possibility remains -- 
it may even be growing -- that the threat of imperial fragmentation or economic 
collapse could doom reform and the reformers, clearing the way for a right-wing 
takeover. What then? What is the plausible worst that might happen? 
</P>
<P>
What almost surely would follow would be a move to restore the rigid controls 
of the Brezhnev era, with all their intolerance of dissent and insistence on 
the Communist Party's unquestioned primacy. It's likely that the military and 
the KGB, whose support would be vital for the success of any anti-reformist 
putsch, would be suitably rewarded. Predictably, the full power of the state 
would be used to crush independence movements in the restive republics, 
conceivably bringing on localized civil wars. Eastern Europe probably would be 
left alone, if only because the enormous economic and political costs of trying 
to reimpose Soviet hegemony would be self-defeating. 
</P>
<P>
And then? A regressive Soviet regime would still face the same problems that 
led to perestroika: an enfeebled economy, a sullen, cynical populace, a system 
that in virtually every area of human activity has been proven not to work. 
Added to that would be a revival of the worst Western suspicions about the 
nature and intentions of Soviet communism. The implications for the U.S. 
defense budget would be obvious: For starters, you could kiss that putative 
peace dividend goodby. 
</P>
<P>
There are, in short, plenty of good reasons and powerful arguments against 
trying to force a reversal of course. Unhappily, in the real world of power 
politics, of ideologically justified personal ambitions, those arguments count 
for little. That's why Ligachev and those who think like him, and the risk to 
reform they present, must continue to be taken seriously.

NORTHROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Les Daly, a spokesman for the Northrop Corp., responded (letter, March 15) to 
an article by Richard Reeves (Op-Ed Page, March 2) about the recent conviction 
of Northrop for fraud on two of our nation's critical weapons systems: the 
nuclear air launched cruise missile, and the U.S. Navy Harrier jet. Daly's 
letter contains several misstatements of fact and seeks to perpetuate 
Northrop's attempt to minimize its guilty conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The letter nowhere mentions the two most significant facts of Northrop's 
conviction. First, this was the first time that a defense contractor has been 
convicted for failing to conduct critical tests, and covering up that failure, 
on a nuclear weapons system. Second, the $17-million criminal fine paid by 
Northrop is by far the largest ever imposed on a defense contractor and 
reflects the seriousness of Northrop's criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Daly's statement that "three or four" people failed to perform tests overlooks 
the fact that it was Northrop which was responsible for the tests, failed to do 
the tests, and then covered up these failures. Moreover, the Northrop employees 
involved in the cheating included the general manager of a Northrop factory 
(who was convicted of eight felony counts of fraud and false statements) and 
the chief engineer of the same factory (who was convicted of three similar 
felony counts). Finally, there were at least five test technicians and 
supervisors who falsified test results at the direction of the general manager 
and chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Daly is also incorrect when he implies that there was a full disclosure by 
Northrop of the cheating on the missile and jet programs. To the contrary, 
Northrop sought from the beginning to suggest that cheating had occurred on 
only about two dozen components for the cruise missile. Northrop also sought to 
minimize its guilt as to the false testing on the jet. However, Northrop was 
indicted in 1989 by a federal grand jury for cheating, and covering up, on 
stabilization systems which went into more than 600 cruise missiles and more 
than 100 jets. Ultimately, Northrop was convicted of cheating on testing of 
components for more than 110 missiles and jets. 
</P>
<P>
We must also take exception to Northrop's claim that it "accepted 
responsibility for the unauthorized and unacceptable acts of three or four of 
its employees even though they had acted on their own." In fact, there was no 
evidence introduced in any court hearing that the convicted employees were 
acting on their own. Instead, the general manager and chief engineer of 
Northrop's factory acted to benefit and did benefit Northrop Corp. The value of 
Northrop's contracts on the missile and jet programs was in the millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to us that the public interest would be better served by Northrop and 
other convicted defense contractors if they would step up to their 
responsibilities when convicted of serious criminal conduct instead of 
attempting to minimize their culpability by a distortion of the facts.

VAN DE KAMP AND RU 486 TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political controversy about abortion is at the center of the problem preventing 
approval in the United States of the French pill RU 486 as reported in the 
story, "Van de Kamp Requests Tests of Abortion Pill" (Part A, March 15). 
</P>
<P>
RU 486, also known as mifepristone, is one of a class of drugs known as 
anti-progesterones which may well prove to have many other beneficial uses than 
just abortion. 
</P>
<P>
It is quite possible that anti-progesterones may be useful as contraceptives, 
as inducers of labor in pregnancies that need to be delivered and which might 
otherwise require a Cesarean delivery, as therapy for endometriosis which may 
cause infertility, as therapy for hormone-dependent cancers and possibly to 
treat certain brain tumors. 
</P>
<P>
If even one of these potentially beneficial uses of anti-progesterones is 
actualized, and some of these potential uses would be to treat infertility and 
pregnancy as well as cancer, will RU 486 continue to be denied official 
approval for use in the U.S.? Is medical care to be provided at the ballot box?

A GOOD SHOW FOR HOUSING IN WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Watts, low-income families often have no choice of where to live other than 
a public housing project. The need for affordable housing there is great, but 
most developers shy away because they fear they won't be able to make a profit 
in a poor part of town. That's why nonprofit developers may offer the best -- 
and in most cases the only -- hope. 
</P>
<P>
There could be more reason to hope starting today, when Mayor Tom Bradley 
dedicates Westminster Park Plaza, a $10-million complex of 130 townhouses that 
has been attracting lots of attention on the South Side. More than 2,000 
families have applied for the new apartments. The lucky tenants who are finally 
selected to live there will pay rents scaled down to their income. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. E. Grace Payne deserves most of the credit for this new project. Six years 
ago she decided to build housing near her Westminister Neighborhood Assn. Inc., 
a Presbyterian-supported center, to discourage families from moving away and to 
encourage children to take pride in their community. Without money, her vision 
stalled until the mayor got on board. He encouraged the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency, better known for its substantial commercial investment 
downtown, to commit $5 million to Payne's effort. 
</P>
<P>
Then Payne met investor David Adams, who committed $1.5 million in exchange for 
tax credits. Like Payne, he insisted on building attractive apartments that 
anybody would be proud to live in, not something quickly tossed up for poor 
people. A $3.5-million loan from Wells Fargo Bank completed the financing. 
</P>
<P>
Black entrepreneurs also played active roles. For-profit developers Marvin 
Greer and Thad Williams worked in tandem with Anthony Cooper, the nonprofit 
developer who guided the project for the newly formed Westminster Neighborhood 
Housing Project. 
</P>
<P>
This public-private nonprofit partnership created the largest complex of 
affordable family housing built in Watts since the riots of 1965. Now the 
partners are working to keep the housing as appealing in the future as it is 
when grand-spanking new. Experienced property managers are screening all 
applicants. Prospective tenants must bring all family members to an interview 
to determine who will actually live in the apartment, and whether the children 
are disciplined. Tenants must also attend an orientation that outlines what is 
expected of them in their new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Even as construction workers put on the finishing touches, Grace Payne and 
Anthony Cooper are working on two new projects to create more affordable 
housing in Watts. It's a tough job,but Westminister Park Plaza proves it can be 
done.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
HOW BIG A GAMBLE IS THIS TRAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A privately operated high-speed train between Anaheim and Las Vegas might 
quicken the pulses of high-rollers. But if it's done right, such a train could 
also raise hopes for getting some commuters off freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Images of the fleeting French and German countrysides are still fresh in the 
minds of a delegation of officials and business executives from the county who 
have just returned from examining France's Train a Grande Vitesse and West 
Germany's magnetically levitated train. The California-Nevada Super Speed Train 
Commission hopes to select one of them, by October, as the model for the 
$4-billion train that would run along the proposed route. 
</P>
<P>
Exciting? Yes. But will the public be asked to kick in? As it stands, public 
funding pays only for administrative costs related to a bistate commission's 
work toward setting up the project. And the law would have to be changed in 
both states to get public money for this project. But what happens if either 
bidder decides it needs public help acquiring land for rights of way? The 
history of private railroads is filled with examples of the taxpayers bailing 
out entrepreneurs who could not make it. 
</P>
<P>
So the Legislature should think long and hard before committing funds to any 
such project, especially with all the rest that needs to be done to improve 
transportation in Orange County. That's especially so because there are no 
answers yet to the second big question: the number of stops between Las Vegas 
and Anaheim, and where they would be located. That's crucial if there is to be 
any hope of using the train for commuters. It's possible, and sensible, for the 
bidders to propose something that would provide express runs to Las Vegas, but 
also double tracks near some stations to allow commuter trains to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's possible that the train will be an entirely private 
undertaking. But that won't be clear until the bids, due in July, are in. But 
if either the German or French proposals are to have any broad significance for 
Orange County, they must offer a system to serve a larger ridership than those 
headed to and from the gambling tables of Nevada.

CHILD INTERPRETERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I believe it is shortsighted for Spanish-speaking immigrants to make their 
children interpret for them ("Littlest Interpreters," March 1). 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants who lived in my Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood came from all over 
Europe. They knew they had to learn English, and fast, if they wanted to enjoy 
the benefits of living in their adopted country. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't claim they were being discriminated against because their children 
were taught in English only, or because election ballots were printed only in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
I'll probably be stripped of my liberal credentials for my views, but so be it!

CRACK BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is terrible how unborn babies can be so mistreated ("Crack Babies: The 
Numbers Mount," editorial, March 17). 
</P>
<P>
How could a mother deliberately and knowingly hurt her baby? 
</P>
<P>
We need to emphasize the ill effects that crack causes, and maybe some of these 
mothers will think twice before they decide to take drugs. Babies that are born 
addicted to crack will just add to the drug problem that is already out of 
control.

Tele-Communications Inc.: The nation's largest cable television system operator 
lost $257 million last year, citing expenses linked to the financing of 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
The loss is in contrast to net earnings of $56 million in 1988. The 
Denver-based firm blamed the loss on "decreased gain on sales of assets." 
Revenue for 1989 rose 36% to $3 billion on a broadening of subscriber base.

COMPUTER FILE: THE NEW BREED OF COMPUTER MICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lowly computer mouse has been getting a lot more fancy lately. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that the most distinguishing characteristics among them were 
minor differences in shape and number of buttons -- two or three for mice that 
work on IBM and compatible computers and one button for Macintosh mice. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are mice with two kinds of sensitivity settings -- resolution and 
acceleration. Resolution is the relationship between how far you move the mouse 
to cause a given movement of the on-screen pointer. Acceleration allows the 
pointer to move farther if you move the mouse faster. 
</P>
<P>
There is also "Lester," a cordless mouse that works by infrared signal like a 
TV remote control. 
</P>
<P>
Another just-introduced mouse looks like a fat pen and is held upright instead 
of lying flat on the desk. 
</P>
<P>
All of these pointing devices have suggested prices ranging from about $120 to 
$200 depending on manufacturer and what software is bundled with them. 
</P>
<P>
The standard by which to judge other mice in the world of IBM and compatibles 
is the Microsoft Mouse, which recently underwent its fourth transformation 
since it was introduced in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft kept the same smoothly sculpted external design it has had since 1987 
but gave the new 400 series mouse different circuitry inside, doubling its 
resolution from 200 to 400 points for each inch movement of the mouse ball. (A 
point is an arbitrary measure; the more points per inch of mouse movement, the 
more sensitive your control over the mouse.) 
</P>
<P>
Cabling also was redesigned so that the mouse can more easily connect with 
serial communications ports or special mouse cards (called "bus" cards) or the 
PS/2-style mouse socket on newer IBM computers. Software is included to let the 
mouse work with either the DOS or OS/2 operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
Resolution and acceleration are controlled by invoking a special program with a 
combination of keyboard and mouse buttons. Resolution is adjusted on a scale 
from 0 to 100. The lowest value requires the greatest mouse movement for a 
given pointer movement on the screen. The highest number requires the least 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Acceleration choices consist of none, slow, moderate and fast. 
</P>
<P>
The effect that different choices make is dramatic. When I tried to be an 
artist with Microsoft's Paintbrush program that is packaged with the mouse, I 
wanted low resolution and no acceleration so that relatively large movements of 
mouse yielded small movements on the screen and gave better control over fine 
details. 
</P>
<P>
But when I wanted to just pick commands from a series of pull-down menus and 
highlight cells in a Quattro Pro spreadsheet, I revved the mouse up to highest 
resolution and fastest acceleration and was quite happy. 
</P>
<P>
A $150 package bundles the Microsoft mouse with Microsoft Paintbrush and menus 
software for use with a variety of programs. A $200 package for 80286- or 
80386-based computers has Windows 286 and PC Paintbrush, a Windows program. You 
have to specify whether you want the serial-PS/2 or bus card version, but the 
price is the same. 
</P>
<P>
Mouse Systems, which has long manufactured an optical mouse that must be used 
on a special grid-marked pad, recently introduced what it calls the "White 
Mouse" that has a roller ball and doesn't need the special pad. 
</P>
<P>
The $119 White Mouse has three buttons and a rounded, sculpted shape. A switch 
on the bottom of the mouse allows it to be used with either two or three 
buttons, enabling it to be compatible with other manufacturers, notably 
Microsoft's two-button design and Logitech's three-button mode. 
</P>
<P>
The mouse has built-in resolution of 350 points per inch and uses software to 
control the degree of acceleration. Choices in Mouse System's Ultra Res 
software range from no acceleration through nine levels of increasing 
acceleration. The top level is the equivalent of having a mouse resolution of 
11,200 points per inch. 
</P>
<P>
In use, I made the same kinds of choices I did with Microsoft's mouse and had 
equivalent results. 
</P>
<P>
The White Mouse may be a better buy, considering its suggested price of $119 
complete with pop-up menus software, PC Paint Plus, applications tool kit 
software to design your own mouse menus for programs and 1-2 Click software to 
use the mouse with Lotus 1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
The MousePen from International Machine Control Systems Inc. in Paso Robles is 
quite a novel design. About 6 inches long with a pen-shaped body that is 
5/8-inch square, it really is just what the name says, a mouse pen. 
</P>
<P>
Where mice generally have a hard rubber ball about an inch in diameter to 
convert horizontal movement across the desktop into pointer movement on the 
screen, the $129 MousePen has a miniature hard plastic ball just 5/16-inch in 
diameter. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution can be controlled by software within a range from 50 to 1,000 
points per inch but doing so is more cumbersome than with either of the other 
two mice. It is done by typing in additional control parameters when you type 
the command that starts the program that operates the MousePen. It isn't hard, 
but you cannot change resolution while you are running another program as you 
can with the others. 
</P>
<P>
Also, unlike the other two, the MousePen is very sensitive to the surface you 
use it on. I had lousy results using it on my polished wood desktop and on 
several types of mouse pads because the slick plastic ball didn't get enough 
traction to roll smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Had I paid attention to an introductory instruction sheet inside the package, 
however, I would have learned that rolling the MousePen across an ordinary 
sheet of paper works best. It was true, and I found the unit entirely 
satisfactory after that. 
</P>
<P>
Two buttons are placed on the front of the pen, one above the other, with the 
one you use most often sitting just where your finger naturally rests. It is 
very easy and natural. Left-handed users should love the MousePen because it is 
built for use with either hand. 
</P>
<P>
Software packaged with MousePen includes menus software and yet another paint 
program, TelePaint. 
</P>
<P>
Lester, the cordless Macintosh mouse, is built by a start-up company, Lightwave 
Technologies Inc. of Vernon Hills, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Priced at $150, it has two components -- an infrared receiver that plugs into 
any model Macintosh and comes with a cord about two-feet long to allow 
placement anywhere in the vicinity of the computer, and the cordless two-button 
mouse. The mouse can be used up to five feet away from the receiver and 
anywhere within 45 degrees either side of center. 
</P>
<P>
The receiver gets its power from the computer, but the mouse needs a pair of 
skinny AAA cells to power it for about 100 hours of use. It turns itself off 
after three minutes of inactivity, but pressing a button on the left side of 
Lester brings it back to life again. 
</P>
<P>
If you hold in the same button while you move the mouse, it either speeds up 
pointer movement or slows it down, depending on how fast or slow you move the 
mouse. The change was very noticeable when moving the pointer across the Mac's 
desktop screen, but didn't seem to have much effect working on a MacDraw II 
drawing. Normal resolution is 200 points per inch. 
</P>
<P>
Both buttons on top of the mouse do the same thing, so you can press the left 
one with your thumb if you are right-handed or the right one if you are 
left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
A cordless mouse for IBM and compatible computers is just entering production 
at Lightwave Technologies. Priced at $130, it will be bundled with menuing 
software and a paint program called Visualizer.

DOW RISES 6.75 AFTER A DAY OF UPS AND DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market posted a slight gain Wednesday in lackluster trading dominated 
by concerns about the U.S. economy and first-quarter corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down about 10 points at its early low, 
closed 6.75 points higher at 2,743.69. 
</P>
<P>
But declining issues nosed out advances in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 724 up, 731 down and 529 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 142.30 million shares, against 131.61 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors stood on the sidelines, unconvinced that Tuesday's big 29-point 
gain in the Dow index marked the beginning of any solid upward move in the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices opened the day mixed, then spent much of the session drifting 
several points above or below Tuesday's closing level. 
</P>
<P>
Economic data offered little insight to turn the market one way or the other. 
The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product grew at a 1.1% 
annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The figure was revised upward from an estimate of 0.9% and came in higher than 
most analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers viewed that as a modest new indication that the pace of business 
activity seemed to be picking up slowly, reducing the chances of any 
full-fledged recession. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, traders also appeared to conclude that the odds were 
shifting in favor of higher interest rates in the months ahead. Rates managed 
to post small declines in the government securities market Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With two trading days left in the first quarter of 1990, the Dow shows a loss 
of just under 10 points since New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of Oracle Systems fell 7 7/8 to close at 17 1/2 after the high-flying 
software firm disclosed disappointing earnings for its fiscal third quarter. 
Volume in Oracle shares totaled 20,613,400, setting a single-day record for 
most active stock traded in the NASDAQ system. The previous record was 
18,991,000 shares set by Apple Computer on Jan. 27, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed sharply lower Wednesday in moderate 
trading. But today, the key 225-share Nikkei blue chip stock index rose 105.53 
points, or 0.34%, to 31,369.10 at midday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices closed higher in dull trading after an early rally ran 
out of steam. At the close, the Financial Times 100-stock index was up 8.8 
points at 2,275.0. 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bonds Up Slightly as U.S. Auctions Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished slightly higher, buoyed by investors' favorable response 
to an auction of government securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond edged up 1/32 point, or about 31 
cents for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield was unchanged from late Tuesday 
at 8.46%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices started the session lower but were later lifted by 
the auction of four-year Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
A total of $8.03 billion in notes was sold out of bids totaling $39.68 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.313%, up from 8.25% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Continues Its Assault on the Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar continued a powerful advance against the beleaguered yen, as 
investors continued to flee from the ailing Japanese currency, but it fell 
against all other major currencies in light, trendless trading. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins, the dollar rose 
for the ninth straight day, closing 1.67 yen higher at 158.63 yen. It also 
traded at that level in London, and at 158.595 yen in New York, up from 157.635 
yen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the yen remained under pressure from turmoil in Japanese share 
prices, which fell 1.77% Wednesday. Also, Japanese interest rates remain 
relatively low despite the Bank of Japan's recent one-point rise in its 
discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Group of Seven nations have refrained from intervening 
aggressively on behalf of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lack of clear policy and control from the government," a dealer in 
Japan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The markets are dictating to the government rather than the government to the 
markets. They don't know how to handle global markets." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed reportedly sold modest amounts of dollars for yen at around 159.10 yen, 
which helped dampen the dollar's advance, dealers said. But they said they 
expected the dollar to hold above 158 yen in the near term, barring further 
concerted intervention from central banks. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Sterling rose to $1.6285 from 
$1.6255 in London, and to $1.6270 from $1.6260 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were slightly higher following a mixed performance overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery 
settled at $369 an ounce, up 30 cents from late Tuesday. Republic National Bank 
in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $369.35 an ounce, up 50 cents. 
Currency dealers attributed the dollar's decline against the European 
currencies, in part, to traders trying to cash in on the dollar's recent gains. 
But they said the market lacked a clear direction. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa Futures Hit Seven-Month Highs 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures prices rocketed to seven-month highs amid fears that political 
and economic crises could disrupt exports from the Ivory Coast and Brazil, the 
world's two largest cocoa producers. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty about Brazil's changing economic policies also underpinned gains in 
futures prices of sugar and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets Wednesday, soybean futures tumbled; copper futures 
surged; petroleum futures were mixed, and livestock and meat futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures settled $39 to $47 higher on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa 
Exchange, with the contract for delivery in May at $1,164 per ton, the highest 
settlement price of a near-month cocoa contract since Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an explosive move, one of the biggest moves I've seen in a long, long 
time," said analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Civil unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, has kept 
the market on edge for the past six weeks following the implementation of 
austerity measures aimed at saving the once-prosperous West African nation from 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Fears of supply disruptions flared again Tuesday on reports of clashes between 
police and protesters whose illegal demonstrations paralyzed the capital city 
of Abidjan. 
</P>
<P>
The market was further supported by rumors that the Brazilian government had 
suspended all commodity exports while it untangles the snarls of red tape 
created by economic reforms announced nearly two weeks ago.

NEW-AGE CONSULTANTS PUT HIGH-TECH, PSYCHOLOGICALLY SLICK TWISTS ON PUBLIC 
RELATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Think the spin doctors are having fun with California's gubernatorial primary? 
Wait until you see what they're doing to the rest of the world -- make that the 
Brave New World. 
</P>
<P>
As one spin doc puts it, "Something is happening in the world, and it ain't 
politics in any form known before, and it's gonna change everything." 
</P>
<P>
What's happening -- high falutin' terminology aside -- is good old public 
relations. But it's public relations with a high-tech, psychologically 
sophisticated twist. 
</P>
<P>
In a darn-near brilliant piece of reportage in the April Manhattan Inc., 
staffer Maura Sheehy examines the Sawyer Miller Group, a New York-based 
consulting firm, which, in its own arrogant view, is revolutionizing the 
emerging democracies of the world and helping to "restructure" America. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking a stilted, largely inarticulate New Age-esque newspeak, the PR guys at 
Sawyer Miller talk of "electronic democracies" and "global linkages." 
</P>
<P>
But when Corazon Aquino's people call in the middle of the Philippine night to 
ask how to treat the major earthquake that just hit, they offer very specific 
spins. When they talk to the leaders or aspiring leaders of Poland or Colombia, 
they explain to them how to use television to make their people think "the 
government can become a part of the family," Sheehy writes. 
</P>
<P>
Through careful research into the country it is advising, the firm, Sheehy 
writes, "can discover what expectations are, so a government can be careful to 
meet those expectations, or more cynically, to appear to meet them." 
</P>
<P>
Or sidetrack them. Before the new Solidarity government in Poland forces its 
austerity program on the Polish people, for instance, it may just take the 
firm's advice and put "some sexy French TV" on the national television station, 
as an "opiate and distraction," Sheehy reports. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer Miller's "manifesto" is purportedly to promote "fluid democracy and 
fluid dialogue." As the article's author points out, though, "What sometimes 
seems absent . . . is the quality and content of the dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Too often, the PR-generated dialogues, such as those that dominated the last 
U.S. presidential campaign, "hit voters deeply, viscerally, emotionally. They 
weren't geared to rational, informed debate." 
</P>
<P>
Still, these spin docs have technical skills that give them power "independent 
of any constituency, save that of the CEOs and politicians who pay their fees." 
</P>
<P>
And with that power they are shaping the way people in South and Central 
America, Eastern Europe, the Philippines and United States, among other places, 
will live. 
</P>
<P>
Fluid democracy aside, what they really hope to create, Sheehy charges, "is a 
kind of shadow government just behind the ears of power, just out of the camera 
shot."

MUST READ 
</P>
<P>
* In Peru, where cocaine is the economy, where Maoist guerrillas calling 
themselves "the shining path" hack to death 39 Indians at a shot, where the 
inflation rate was 3,000% last year, it makes a magical realist sort of sense 
for a novelist to run for president. In the April Esquire, Guy Martin follows 
Mario Vargas Llosa on the campaign trail as this former 
Marxist-turned-Thatcherite, decked out in his $1,500 suits, glad-hands his way 
through villages of his "rock-sucking poor" countrymen. By the way: Guess which 
PR firm is handling his campaign? 
</P>
<P>
* Are Robert Redford, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and other Hollywood 
movers dupes of Fidel Castro? That's the assertion of an incendiary article in 
the April 16 New Republic. In question is Cuba's internationally known film 
foundation, headed by novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. As portrayed in the 
piece, Marquez is something of politically motivated money grubber, and he and 
Fidel "are using a cultural project to legitimize one of the last bastions of 
Stalinist rule -- then roping in Hollywood to do the PR." 
</P>
<P>
* When a Japanese company bought an American Mexican food chain recently, the 
jokes about sushi burritos reflected the nation's growing anxiety about foreign 
takeovers. In the March Business Tokyo, "The people who work at three 
illustrious concerns describe what it is like to be Bought By the Japanese." 
Actually, it's the people who run those companies who do most of the 
describing. As a consequence, the piece is pretty upbeat. It's also 
informative. 
</P>
<P>
* "We particularly want to thank the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences for its generous assistance. . . ." Who's talking here? Jessica Tandy? 
Akira Kurosawa? Nope. It's Architectural Digest in its introduction to its 
April "Academy Awards Collector's Edition!" More interesting than any of the 
after-awards party coverage, the issue offers glimpses into the homes of film 
stars past and present, including Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Mary 
Pickford, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, Liza Minnelli, Gene 
Hackman, Humphrey Bogart and Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
* To most people, it will look like a strange stamp collection. Trivia junkies 
and nostalgia freaks, however, will probably spend hours poring over Sports 
Illustrated's special 35th anniversary issue with 35 years of SI covers. 
</P>
<P>
* Horror stories about communist and Nazi kids who snitched on their parents to 
the KGB or Gestapo once were the basic stuff of American propaganda. Now, here 
in America, we salute the youngsters who fink on mom or dad for drug use. The 
April Life magazine presents an complex and intriguing profile of Bradley 
O'Hara, a 9-year-old who turned in his mom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHREDDER FODDER 
</P>
<P>
* As usual, this week's Entertainment Weekly is in too big a hurry to spend 
more than a few paragraphs on any film, TV show, book or musical creation. But 
it does devote six full pages of homage to the making of one of those "hip, 
glamorous," Nike ads by Spike Lee. Yawn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW ON NEWS RACKS 
</P>
<P>
* Countryside, a new magazine "devoted to the interests of the increasing 
number of weekend or full-time countrysiders -- contemporary young 
professionals and their families who yearn for a simpler, unspoiled life style 
closer to nature" is just about as good and bad as you'd expect. 
</P>
<P>
At its best, it offers pieces such as author Alston Chase's thoughtful essay on 
the reality awaiting urban exiles: "Ecological decline is not something we can 
run away from." 
</P>
<P>
At its worst, the Hearst Corp. bimonthly carries newspaper reprints such as: 
"The Greening of a Wall Streeter -- An ex-banker milks her sheep for gourmet 
cheese and yogurt." 
</P>
<P>
In either case, the magazine deserves applause for contributing the charter 
advertising revenues from the slick first issue to organizations that buy 
ecologically sensitive land to protect it.

YOUR WHEELS: 'LEMON LAW' PROVIDES FOR REMEDIES TO OWNERS OF DEFECTIVE CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I purchased a new Nissan Sentra nearly a year ago. I've taken it into 
the dealership repeatedly because it tends to stall in traffic jams. I am 
frustrated because I don't think the dealer knows how to fix it. I am 
considering filing a lawsuit under the "lemon law," but I don't know where to 
begin. I understand various groups offer arbitration, but I have friends who 
advise me to get a lawyer. What should I do? -- S.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You will find no shortage of books, pamphlets and guides to help assert 
your rights under various arbitration programs and lemon laws. The problem is 
selecting the route that will satisfy your goals with the least headache and in 
the shortest possible time. 
</P>
<P>
In the simplest terms, lemon laws are intended to force a manufacturer to 
replace your car if it cannot be satisfactorily repaired after a limited number 
of attempts. California has the nation's strongest lemon law, known as the 
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, but almost every state has a similar law, 
and the federal Magnuson-Moss Act applies all over the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Song-Beverly law, a motorist is entitled to a full refund or a 
replacement car if, during the first year, a specific problem cannot be 
repaired after four attempts or if the car is out of service for more than 30 
days for any problems. 
</P>
<P>
The law also provides for punitive damages. About half of all cases are settled 
with punitive damages, which can range from $1,000 to $100,000, according to 
Norman Taylor, a Los Angeles attorney with one of the largest lemon law 
practices in the nation. Most lemon laws provide for attorney fees to be paid 
by the manufacturer, and most attorneys take cases on a contingency fee, so 
there is little downside risk for the motorist. 
</P>
<P>
"We have touched only the tip of the iceberg under this law," Taylor said. 
"There aren't enough people who are aware of their rights." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can also go to small claims court, but damages are limited to actual 
losses and are capped, typically, at $2,000. You cannot be represented by an 
attorney in small claims court and if you lose your case, you generally are out 
of luck, because such decisions cannot be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally there are the arbitration boards, set up by the manufacturers 
themselves or by organizations such as the Better Business Bureau. In many 
cases, arbitration is a required first step before a lemon law suit. (Lawsuits 
may drag on for a year and a half, during which time you will continue to 
suffer with your lemon.) 
</P>
<P>
Taylor insists that such arbitration boards are not neutral bodies and 
generally are not licensed by state consumer affairs organizations. And they do 
not operate under the strict regulations set down by lemon laws. Such boards 
generally are panned by consumer advocates as well. 
</P>
<P>
Before deciding on a course of action, you may want to read some specialized 
publications. The Center for Auto Safety, a Ralph Nader group, publishes the 
368-page Lemon Book, which contains details on almost every state's lemon law, 
suggestions on small claims cases and information about various arbitration 
boards. It is available in bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Consumer Affairs publishes Lemon-Aid for New Car 
Buyers, an easy 12-page guide to the Song-Beverly law. You can get it by 
sending a stamped, self-addressed legal-size envelope to the department, P.O. 
Box 310, Sacramento, Calif. 95802. 
</P>
<P>
The Better Business Bureau publishes How BBB Auto Line Works, concerning its 
arbitration program. It is available from the Council for Better Business 
Bureaus, Southern California Auto Line, 5800 S. Eastern Ave. 370, Commerce, 
Calif. 90040. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Of what use is a ported vacuum switch? Mine was broken off and the car still 
drove all right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.F.S. 
</P>
<P>
A. A ported vacuum switch is part of a vacuum-operated system, such as the 
vacuum advance for the distributor or the exhaust-gas recirculation system. At 
idle, the switch provides no vacuum, and once the car is under way, it provides 
vacuum to whatever system with which it is connected. 
</P>
<P>
Without knowing which ported vacuum switch broke on your car, its effect is 
difficult to determine. If it is the vacuum advance on the distributor, you 
might not notice any change, but you may be losing fuel economy and 
performance.

YOUR STAMPS: OLYMPICS ISSUES NOT WORTH MUCH 
</P>

Question: I have several souvenir sheets of commemorative stamps from the 1936 
Olympics in Berlin. Do these have any value? -- F.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Maybe $15 apiece if in mint condition, $25 each if legitimately 
cancelled (retail prices); this is an example of how certain stamps are more 
valuable cancelled than mint. 
</P>
<P>
Your sheets are listed in the Scott catalogue under German semi-postals, with 
catalogue numbers B91 and B92. They had a first day of issue Aug. 1, 1936, just 
in time for the Olympic festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Germany then, as always, had many enthusiastic stamp collectors, who purchased 
enough of these souvenir sheets so that their market value is only moderate 
today. These sheets sold for 1 Mark each in Berlin, with a substantial part of 
the stamp revenue earmarked for the German Olympic effort. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a U.S. Government Thrift Card, containing seven 25-cent Thrift 
Stamps. While in grammar school during World War I, I bought these weekly. Are 
they worth anything now? -- G.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: The current catalogue value for this stamp, listed in the Scott catalogue 
under War Savings Stamps (catalogue number WS1), is $10. Issued by the U.S. 
Treasury Department on Dec. 1, 1917, these stamps were redeemable in U.S. 
Treasury War Certificates. If you had a mint margin block of six stamps with 
the plate number on it, you would have a $500 item. As it is, your Thrift 
stamps affixed to their savings card lose a little of their collector appeal in 
the eyes of some philatelists, and maybe your whole card is worth about $20 or 
$25 retail price. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to order British stamps directly from the British government at 
face value. Is this possible? -- P.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Write to: British Philatelic Bureau, 20 Brandon St., Edinburgh EH3 5TT, 
Scotland, Great Britain. They accept personal checks and international money 
orders, and they have a procedure for a "standing account" whereby you send 
them a deposit and automatically receive new issues of British stamps. Mint 
stamps, first-day covers and special postmarks are available. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if you need only a mint single of each British new issue for your 
collection, it might be cheaper to get it from a local stamp shop to avoid 
paying the postage and check fees connected with ordering from the British 
Philatelic Bureau.

YOUR COINS: ROLLS WERE IN DEMAND SEVERAL DECADES AGO

Question: The following half dollars in good condition -- not uncirculated, not 
excellent, but "good" -- include a 1941-S, 1942-D, 1943-S, 1944 and 1944-S, 
1945-S and 1947-D. Also there's a roll of 1964 quarters and a roll of 1964 
halves, all in good and fair condition. Then there's a silver-certificate 
1935-G dollar with the signature of Henry Morgenthau Jr. and a blue seal; and a 
1935-A paper dollar with Hawaii printed twice on the front with a gold seal and 
gold serial numbers. -- R.E.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There are several interesting aspects of your letter. When you 
described your half dollars as being in "good" condition, you were unwittingly 
using a specific numismatic term to describe low-grade circulated coins, which 
I suspect accurately describes your 50-cent pieces. If so, they are worth about 
$1.50 each, primarily because of their silver content. 
</P>
<P>
You also mention a roll of quarters and a roll of halves. Both of your rolls 
are worth about $35 each. The reason is there are 20 coins in a roll of halves 
and 40 in a roll of quarters. Again, the value is primarily in the silver. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the '50s and '60s, it was popular to collect coins by the roll. It took 
20 coins to make up a roll of dollars, 50 for a roll of dimes, 40 for a roll of 
nickels and 50 for a roll of cents. You don't see too many original rolls 
nowadays. Many have been broken up and the coins sold individually. But some 
collectors still prefer rolls, either original from the bank or put together 
from circulation. 
</P>
<P>
As for your $1 bills, the 1935 silver certificate is just worth face value. The 
$1 Hawaii overprint is worth about $5.

Shalom to the Berlin Orchestra: At last, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra will 
visit Israel on April 10-18. 
</P>
<P>
Until Herbert Von Karajan resigned as the orchestra's chief conductor shortly 
before his death last year, a visit to Israel was taboo because of Karajan's 
reported links to the Nazi party. Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim will lead 
the orchestra in Jerusalem, Haifa and Tel Aviv. At the final concert on April 
18 in Tel Aviv, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Zubin Mehta, 
will play a joint concert with the Berlin ensemble. BETH KLEID

Another Platform for Jackson: Actress Glenda Jackson is running for Britain's 
Parliament and says she'll give up acting if elected. The Oscar-winning star of 
such films as "A Touch of Class" and "Women in Love" beat three other 
contenders late Tuesday for the right to run for a Labor Party seat in an area 
of north London. "Its quite wonderful that I've won and it's a humbling 
experience," said Jackson, who pledged to give up acting and devote herself to 
politics if she wins the parliamentary election that will be held before 
mid-1992. BETH KLEID

Italian-Americans Didn't Laugh: Two Italian-American organizations found little 
humor in comic Billy Crystal's Italian joke during the Academy Awards ceremony, 
and complained to ABC about it. 
</P>

Crystal, host for the 62nd annual awards ceremony broadcast on ABC, quipped 
that the proposed purchase of MGM by an Italian businessman meant the famous 
lion would no longer roar at the start of the movie but instead plead the Fifth 
Amendment. "It was a cheap-shot joke against Italian-Americans," said a release 
from the Coalition of Italo-American Organizations. "There is a fine line 
between ethnic humor and negative stereotyping. We feel (Crystal) crossed that 
line." BETH KLEID

WATTAGE OF YOUR MICROWAVE IS SIMPLE TO TEST 
</P>

All microwave ovens are not created equal. Just as microwave ovens vary in 
size, shape and color, their cooking power -- or wattage -- varies from oven to 
oven. 
</P>
<P>
Wattage affects cooking times, so it helps to know your microwave oven's 
wattage. However, according to the Campbell Microwave Institute, 88% of 
microwave oven owners don't know their oven's wattage, or they guess 
incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
What's your watt? Here's a simple water test from the institute to help you 
determine your oven's wattage in minutes: 
</P>
<P>
 WATTAGE TEST 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fill a glass measuring cup with exactly one cup of tap water. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) until water begins to boil. 
Start by setting the timer at three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the water boils in less than three minutes, the oven's wattage is 600 to 
700 watts. If the water boils in three to four minutes, the oven's wattage is 
500 to 600 watts. If the water boils in more than four minutes, the oven's 
wattage is less than 500 watts. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have determined the oven's wattage, you can adjust cooking times to 
achieve more precise results. Many microwave recipes and package directions are 
developed for 600- to 700-watt ovens. If your oven is less than 600 watts, 
you'll need to add extra time to each step of the cooking directions. 
</P>
<P>
 WATTAGE AND TIMING TIPS 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wattage output is reduced when the oven competes for electric power, such 
as when air conditioners or other major appliances are on. Thus, cooking time 
may need to be increased to compensate for lower wattage output. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heating directions are developed using foods at normal storage 
temperatures. Directions for frozen products are based on foods five degrees to 
10 degrees. If ice cream in the freezer stays soft, chances are that all the 
frozen foods have a higher temperature than 10 degrees -- and will cook more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As a rule, cook only one frozen dinner or entree at at time. If preparing 
two dinners or entrees, heat the one with a longer cooking time first, then 
keep it covered while heating the second one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Standing time is the final stage of cooking for some products and recipes; 
a time for heat to spread evenly through the food. If a food has been covered 
during heating, keep the cover on during standing time.

Here are some alternative ways to use cooked rice: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Italian Rice: Add diced fresh or canned tomatoes and a dash of basil and 
oregano leaves to cooked rice. 
</P>
<P>
Heat and serve. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Russian Rice: Season cooked rice with bottled Russian dressing. Heat and 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Garden Rice: No matter how small the amount, add leftover vegetables (peas, 
corn, beans) to cooked rice. Heat and serve. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rice for Lamb: Season rice with garlic salt instead of plain salt, using 
the amount given on the package. Before serving, stir in chopped fresh mint or 
dried mint leaves. 
</P>
<P>

FOOD PHARMACY: A FALSE BELIEF IN A DIET SLOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN CARPER, Carper is a medical and nutrition writer and the author of 15 
books, including The Food Pharmacy. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Do you believe that the more you diet, the harder it is to lose weight because 
your body adapts and turns down your rate of burning calories -- your 
metabolism? 
</P>
<P>
This belief is extremely popular, but wrong, according to new U.S. Department 
of Agriculture research by Dr. William Rumpler, who used a specially built, 
room-size live-in calorimeter to assess calories burned. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers measured calories burned during 24-hour periods before and after 28 
men went on a calorie-reduced diet. Considering lower caloric intake, the men 
did not burn fewer calories than they did prior to the diet. "Their metabolism 
rate did not decrease," says Dr. Paul Moe, head of the USDA lab. 
</P>
<P>
This is good news for dieters because "they can now be confident that if they 
stay on a reduced-calorie diet, they will lose weight," insists Moe. 
</P>
<P>
He says a main reason dieters have so much trouble continuing to lose weight is 
because they don't take in fewer calories for their reduced body size. "If you 
were once 130 pounds and you get down to 110," he explains, "you must eat like 
a person who weighs 110, not someone who still weighs 130." 
</P>
<P>
If you fear developing pancreatic cancer, eat more beans, lentils, peas 
(legumes) and dried fruits. Ditto for prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
To ward off colon cancer? Eat more beta-carotene foods, such as carrots, 
spinach and other green leafy vegetables and cut back on meat. To inhibit lung 
and stomach cancer, eat more fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the implications from the latest findings of a long-term study of 
34,000 Seventh Day Adventists. Those eating the most of such foods were least 
likely to develop such cancers. 
</P>
<P>
What about heart disease? Surprisingly, after accounting for such factors as 
smoking, obesity and high blood pressure, "one food stood out, as protective 
against heart attacks -- nuts," says Dr. Gary Fraser, director of the study and 
a professor at Loma Linda University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
People who ate nuts four times a week had about half the chances of a fatal or 
non-fatal heart attack as those who ate nuts less than once a week. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of nuts? That's what Fraser wants to know too. He's planning tests to 
feed men various nuts and then check their blood pressure, blood fats and 
blood-clotting factors. 
</P>
<P>
Is fiber the reason high-fiber foods seem to discourage various diseases, 
including cancer, heart disease and diabetes? Maybe not. Or maybe fiber is only 
part of the reason. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Dr. Lilian Thompson, University of Toronto, among others, is 
discovering. In trying to sort out what makes high-fiber, high complex 
carbohydrate foods healthful, she found that a compound previously thought 
harmful may in fact be beneficial. It's phytate, also called phytic acid. It is 
highly concentrated in high-fiber foods, notably dried beans and lentils. 
</P>
<P>
Such legumes are well-established reducers of blood cholesterol and blood 
sugar. But when Thompson removed phytate from navy bean flour, it no longer 
stopped sharp surges of blood sugar in human volunteers. Only beans with 
phytate did that, regardless of their fiber content. That makes Thompson 
speculate that so-called "anti-nutrients" like phytate "are mostly responsible 
for the benefits of high-fiber foods." 
</P>
<P>
Phytates may also be one reason legume-lovers have less cancer of certain 
types. University of Maryland researchers found that cancer-exposed rats given 
phytate in their drinking water had 35% fewer cancers than rats not given 
phytate.

CHOCOLATE TILES SWEETEN DESSERT TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the eye-catching features at the Party of the '90s staged by the 
National Assn. of Catering Executives was the decoration of the dessert tables 
with jaggedly broken, multicolored chocolate tiles. 
</P>
<P>
The tiles were made by Susan Ettesvold, pastry apprentice at the Westin 
Bonaventure. Ettesvold picked up the idea from pastry chef and food artist 
Robert Lambert, who describes it in his book, "Fantasy Chocolate Desserts" 
(Chronicle Books: $14.95). 
</P>
<P>
Lambert, of San Anselmo, regards the tiles as his signature technique. He cuts 
them into sheets to coat cakes, breaks them into pieces to form jaunty 
garnishes and colors them in imaginative ways. 
</P>
<P>
The intricately patterned tiles look difficult to make, and they do require 
special materials. These are white pastel coating chocolate, which does not 
contain cocoa butter; powdered color or liquid candy color and parchment 
sheets. All can be found at cake and pastry supply houses. Once these products 
are obtained, the procedure is easy, and Ettesvold demonstrated the steps in 
The Times' Test Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
First, she melted the cut-up chocolate in a steel bowl over a pan half-filled 
with simmering water. The water should not touch the bowl, and the chocolate 
must be kept at a constant temperature. Periodically lifting the bowl away from 
the water will help to avoid overheating, Ettesvold said. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the warm chocolate is divided into bowls for coloring. Ettesvold 
explained that ordinary household food color cannot be used because it will 
cause the chocolate to "seize up," or harden and become unusable. 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate can now be tinted as desired. Or it can be left untinted and then 
patterned with streaks of color. 
</P>
<P>
The tiles are molded on the back of a sheet pan. Using a paper towel, spread 
the back with a thin coat of vegetable oil and cover with a sheet of parchment. 
Ettesvold suggested keeping the melted chocolates warm and pliable by placing 
the containers over hot water. 
</P>
<P>
Now pour the base color onto the prepared pan and with a spatula spread it in 
an even coat about the thickness of a quarter. If topping with a pattern such 
as stripes, place the desired color of coating chocolate in a parchment pastry 
cone or resealable plastic bag with one corner snipped off. For demonstration, 
Ettesvold piped color in straight lines back and forth across the length of the 
chocolate base. Then she pulled a skewer across the lines to produce an 
irregular design. 
</P>
<P>
Ettesvold cautioned that the chocolate base coat must be kept warm during this 
procedure. If it hardens, slide the pan into an open 350-degree oven and watch 
carefully until it softens, a matter of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
When the design is complete, give the pan a sharp tap or two on the counter to 
produce a level surface. Now let the chocolate dry at room temperature. This 
will take about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
When the tile is firm enough to handle, cut shapes with cookie cutters or a 
sharp knife and remove them from the parchment. Or peel the entire sheet from 
the parchment and break it into irregular shapes. 
</P>
<P>
Ettesvold used some of the broken tiles to decorate a cake, which she also 
trimmed with piped-on puffs of whipped cream. The tiles are not fragile. 
According to author Lambert, they will keep for several weeks if covered and 
stored in a cool, dark place. Ettesvold noted that the chocolate may "bloom" if 
refrigerated. Therefore, they should be added to perishable desserts just 
before serving.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SUCCESS AT PHYSICAL FITNESS IS NOT LIMITED TO THOSE WITH 
IDEAL BODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In America today, two visions seem to be emerging simultaneously. One is of 
sleek, muscled bodies in expensive jogging shoes, colorful workout leotards or 
revealing swimsuits. Svelte yet strong, this contingent sips diet sodas or 
light beers, shuns fat and cholesterol and opts for slenderizing salads and 
bean-sprout sandwiches in between trips to the health club. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, we've got the queen-size, comfortable look, fast-food fries, 
crispy cooked chicken, burgers with everything and doughnuts baked fresh each 
morning. This group varies from the "plump-is-prettier, 
I-accept-myself-the-way-I-am" stance to the "I'll kill myself if I don't lose 
40 pounds by next Wednesday, I'm going on a starvation diet now" approach. 
</P>
<P>
What we're witnessing is partly encouraging, partly disturbing. In America 
today, 34 million of us are overweight. Of that group, 13 million are seriously 
obese. By contrast, only 30% of the population exercises regularly, and only 
some at a level that promotes cardiovascular fitness. 
</P>
<P>
But in TV and print advertising, the image of the physically fit, healthy, 
happy individual is consistently held out as the ideal. Success is portrayed as 
a combination of youthful physical prowess, self-confidence and affluence. 
</P>
<P>
In life, there is always a conflict between reality and perfection. Naturally, 
we think good health and physical fitness are worthy goals toward which we all 
should strive. It's healthier not to be overweight, and it feels good to be 
physically active. What's more, it's a sign of civilization's progress that the 
old view of women -- as weak creatures in need of protection -- is being 
replaced by a vision of strength and independence. 
</P>
<P>
TV or magazine ads that show people jogging or lifting weights may spur some 
people into action. That's all to the good. Where we might run into trouble is 
when such a presentation of the small group of Americans who are at the 
pinnacle of fitness becomes not an inspiration but a source of depression to 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a good 75 pounds overweight, seeing an ad for a slender celebrity 
working out at the spa could make you feel worse than ever. You may say to 
yourself, "I can't afford to join a health club, and even if I exercised for a 
million years I'd never look like a famous movie star, so why bother?" And then 
there's your hand, reaching for the doughnut box again. 
</P>
<P>
Our message is a simple one: Set your own goals. In their desire to sell 
products, the media and the industries they represent create images we can 
never match in our own lives. But that doesn't mean we should give up and sink 
into sedentary "flabdom." 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to aim for the body of celebrated muscle man or Wonder Woman to 
be healthy and strong. In other words, you don't have to try to re-make 
yourself to fit somebody else's vision of perfection -- a goal you probably 
can't achieve anyway. That might just mean setting yourself up for failure and 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Think realistically, not on a grand scale. Ask yourself, "What can I do today 
to maintain or improve my health?" How about a 20-minute walk? Or a trip to the 
supermarket to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. Forgo the submarine sandwich at 
lunch and take something lighter; go to the store and price exercise machines; 
check a cookbook for a new, interesting low-fat recipe. Find out where in your 
neighborhood you can swim regularly; use stairs instead of elevators at work; 
go for an after-dinner stroll with your family instead of (or at least before) 
plunking down by the TV. 
</P>
<P>
These suggestions add up to a general approach that can make a difference. 
You're likely to find that some of the changes turn out to be fun, not 
burdensome, as long as you're following your own agenda rather than forcing 
yourself into a prefabricated model. 
</P>
<P>
The point is to think about what your own life is like and what your 
preferences are, and to incorporate into that a desire to be a healthier, more 
active person. The Greeks devised the concept of the "golden mean," which has 
remained valid throughout the span of centuries. The muscular actor or actress 
in the TV commercial whose body is sculpted to perfection and who seems to own 
the world may have about as much to do with body type and life as does the man 
in the moon. 
</P>
<P>
But if that vision isn't attainable, the alternative doesn't have to be 
resignation and a size-large pizza. There is a place in between spending 
umpteen hours a day at a health club and growing so totally out of shape that 
you get winded running for the telephone. You need to find that place -- your 
own personal golden mean -- and use it to work toward good health and good 
times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slight Differences for Pink, White Grapefruit 
</P>
<P>
Question: Are there any nutritional differences between pink grapefruit and 
white grapefruit? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The real difference between the two is that pink or red grapefruit 
contains some carotene, which the body converts to Vitamin A. Color is the key 
to how much it provides. 
</P>
<P>
For example, figures derived from an average of pink and red fruits grown in 
California, Arizona and Florida indicate that half a grapefruit will provide, 
on average, about 6% of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for Vitamin A. 
However, values for red grapefruit from Texas are more than twice that. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, grapefruit are nutritionally similar. For a small grapefruit 
weighing about a pound, half will have approximately 40 calories. It also 
contains some iron and B vitamins. And it is an excellent source of Vitamin C; 
a small grapefruit usually provides 75% of the day's needs. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I bought two bottles of olive oil several months ago. When I went to use the 
second one, I noticed a milky residue in the bottom. Does this mean it's 
unsafe? 
</P>
<P>
A: No it doesn't. The fatty acids in olive oil are mainly monounsaturated. 
However, it also contains varying amounts of saturated fatty acids, which tend 
to be solid at room temperature. The milky residue you describe is made up of 
crystals of saturated fatty acids that have settled to the bottom of the 
bottle. You would observe the same phenomenon, perhaps even more extensively, 
if you stored the oil in the refrigerator, since cooler temperatures speed the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean you should avoid refrigeration. While olive oil can keep up 
to two years if tightly sealed and stored away from heat and light, it is 
sometimes recommended that to prevent it from becoming rancid, it should be 
stored in the refrigerator when the weather is hot and humid. As it comes to 
room temperature, or with slight warming, it will turn clear once again. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We live in an area where there are many fine restaurants. Yet for anyone 
interested in a low-fat, health-conscious menu, eating out is very difficult. 
We've spoken to one young chef who says that if he had guidelines, he would add 
a low-fat selection to the menu. Can you give us directions in helping him? 
</P>
<P>
A: Across the country, both fine restaurants serving elegant fare and those 
catering to more everyday needs increasingly are offering low-fat menus 
designed to please the palate and, at the same time, taste as good as richer 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The basis guidelines are the same as those used by millions of Americans in 
their homes. They begin with heavy reliance on ingredients that are low in fat 
and light on salt, and then preparing them by methods that do not require 
adding much salt or fat, particularly saturated fat. And, of course, for flavor 
they should rely on the freshness of the food and on herbs and spices, rather 
than a heavy hand with the salt shaker. 
</P>
<P>
For example, well-seasoned vegetables purees often replace rich cream sauces 
for chicken. Alternatively, a tart fruit sauce is used for lightly sauteed fish 
fillets or poultry. Pasta dishes with simple but appealing sauces prepared from 
several varieties of mushrooms carefully seasoned with herbs and perhaps a 
little smoked salmon are another choice. In place of (or in addition to) 
cream-based soups, restaurants are offering soups that make use of good fish 
stock, hot chile seasonings or the wonderful flavor of fresh vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh fruit, attractively served, should be a menu mainstay, with some sorbet 
for those who want it, and perhaps cookies prepared with unsaturated fat. Some 
people are concerned about fat and sodium but not worried about their weight. 
For that audience, the chef might prepare elegant desserts, such as cakes 
prepared mainly with oil (not butter) and served with fruit slices. 
</P>
<P>
To help the young chef get started, we have several basic suggestions. First, 
he might begin by searching among his repertoire for recipes that lend 
themselves to adaptation. Second, he should consider working with a registered 
dietitian who could not only offer specific guidance on modifying his recipes, 
but who could provide him with nutrient analyses with respect to fat, saturated 
fat and sodium. He can find one through his state's dietetic association. 
</P>
<P>
We also recommend that the chef clearly identify those special dishes on this 
menu, and provide information about calories, fat and sodium to his customers. 
Experience suggest that all this is good for business.

MOST STILL OPTING FOR THE QUICK HEALTH FIX 
</P>

Sick of oat bran, but worried about eating "healthy?" 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Wellman, president of the American Dietetic Assn. in Chicago, says 
Americans want to believe they have entered the age of hyper-nutrition. 
However, she says, there are no quick fixes -- and no magic foods. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Gallup survey commissioned by the American Dietetic Assn. and the Food 
Information Council, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., says 
95% of Americans believe balance, variety and moderation are the keys to 
healthy eating. 
</P>
<P>
"The poll shows Americans know about nutrition and health," Wellman said, "but 
when it comes to translating facts into food choices, most still opt for quick 
fixes and the latest health fads." 
</P>
<P>
For example, 52% of adults reported increasing consumption of oat bran, and 48% 
said they were using more vitamin supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when asked if they were increasing anything else in their diet due to 
health concerns, only 8% reported eating more vegetables, and only 6% said they 
were consuming more fruits or fruit juices. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the Gallup survey were announced at a press conference here. The 
survey results were based on telephone interviews with a randomly selected 
national sample of 772 adults, 18 years of age and older. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven percent of the survey respondents said they believe there are 
"good" and "bad" foods. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Stenzel, executive director of the Food Information Council, says the 
perception of "good" and "bad" food leads consumers to "needlessly eliminate" 
foods they perceive as bad -- including red meat and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
Wellman says red meat is a valuable source of iron; dairy foods are an 
important source of calcium. 
</P>
<P>
"In searching for the 'perfect' food, many people lose sight of the big 
picture," Wellman says. "What's important is the nutritional adequacy of the 
total diet over time, not whether individual foods are 'good' or 'bad' in terms 
of fat or other nutrients." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Margo Denke, a nutrition research scientist at the University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, says that despite an awareness of basic 
nutrition principles, many consumers seem to view food as medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"They think adding or eliminating a particular food or ingredient will 
automatically prevent or cure illness," she said. "Such an approach is not only 
unrealistic, it can also prove harmful." 
</P>
<P>
Denke said that while nutrition research must examine the effects of nutrients 
individually, such studies should not be immediately translated into food 
choices.

RULING PUTS HARRIS CLOSER TO EXECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge turned down Robert Alton Harris' appeal of his death sentence 
Wednesday, leaving the condemned killer with only the slimmest hope of avoiding 
execution Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge William B. Enright, who twice before has denied Harris' 
pleas for mercy, turned him down again, saying there was no merit to a new 
appeal his San Diego lawyers filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also sharply criticized Harris' attorneys for the tactics they 
pursued in filing the appeal. And he said the 11-year odyssey Harris' case has 
taken through the state and federal courts was an abuse of legal process that 
has generated disrespect for the judicial system among a frustrated public. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, this case, and all the tragedy it has brought to so many lives, 
has fully run its course," Enright said. "The decision that was solemnly and 
legally made by the jury 11 years ago should be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
"All things I know of in this world have a beginning. All things have an end. 
And this matter should now be concluded." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys appealed Enright's decision immediately after the hearing to 
the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the next-to-last step Harris has left. 
If the San Francisco-based appellate court also rejects Harris, his sole hope 
lies with the U. S. Supreme Court -- which has denied Harris' appeals four 
times, most recently on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, is in line to become the first person executed in California in 23 
years. His case has progressed further through the court system than any of the 
other more than 270 prisoners on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
His only hope for reprieve lies with the federal courts because last week he 
withdrew a request that Gov. George Deukmejian consider clemency -- that is, 
commute his death sentence to life in prison. In a letter to the governor, 
Harris said he did not think he could get a fair hearing from Deukmejian, a 
longtime advocate of capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The state courts repeatedly have denied Harris' pleas for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court upheld Harris' death sentence in 1981. Two weeks 
ago, that court turned down a new appeal that Harris' San Diego attorneys, 
Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe, filed Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The federal appeal, filed Monday, essentially relied on the same arguments that 
failed to persuade the state Supreme Court to spare Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys contended that new psychiatric evidence shows that Harris 
suffered from a variety of mental disorders that played a part in the July 5, 
1978, killings of San Diego teen-agers Michael Baker and John Mayeski. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unfair to execute Harris because those conditions were not 
considered when he was sentenced, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the ailments was organic damage to the brain, particularly to that part 
that controls impulse, defense attorneys said. The murders did not occur 
because Harris is an unredeemable sociopath, as prosecutors contended at the 
trial, but because he was driven by uncontrollable impulse, defense lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mental disorders were not considered when Harris was sentenced, it 
would be unfair to execute him, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris killed both 16-year-old boys after stealing their car for use in a bank 
robbery. He abducted them from a fast-food restaurant's parking lot, where they 
were eating lunch. Later, he ate their half-finished hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
No one knew about the disorders when Harris was sentenced in 1979 because the 
psychologists who tested him didn't do a good job, the defense lawyers said. 
And his lawyer at the trial, San Diego attorney Thomas Ryan, did Harris a 
disservice because he relied on the psychiatrists' reports, they contended. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office maintained that the claim of new evidence 
was nothing more than an attempt by defense attorneys to put new labels on old 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Enright said Wednesday that he wondered why Sevilla and McCabe even tried the 
tactic. His review of the trial record indicated that the doctors and Ryan had 
done a fine job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was "very difficult" to understand why the defense lawyers had chosen to 
"belittle the efforts and demean the professional reputation of those who have 
labored in the same vineyard previously," Enright said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he wondered if claims such as the ones raised by Sevilla and 
McCabe served only to deter other doctors or lawyers from taking part in 
demanding cases. It was no encouragement to work diligently on a case and then 
later have "unchallenged" professional reputations "unmercifully pilloried," 
Enright said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I wonder if this is really part of the normal appellate process in a case 
like this," he said. He added, "I am fearful that this approach does 
substantial disservice to the profession," referring to the practice of law. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla maintained after the hearing that he and McCabe were being 
professionally responsible and said they were simply trying a tactic that had 
proven successful in similar cases. 
</P>
<P>
After questioning the approach the defense lawyers took, Enright also made it 
clear that he thought it was without substance. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has "had his day in court as no other" prisoner, Enright said. "No 
constitutional error has occurred, no miscarriage of justice has been had. 
(Harris) has had his rights fully and fairly preserved at every level of trial 
and review." 
</P>
<P>
The judge closed the hearing by discussing the danger that Harris' lengthy 
appeals pose to the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the differing views many of us may hold on capital punishment, I 
think it should be said that capital punishment is the law of this state," 
Enright said. "It has been repeatedly and expressly validated by the citizens 
of this state. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a mockery of our law, which is the very fabric of our society, a bond 
of a self-governing people, to conclude that capital punishment is incapable, 
incapable of being enforced," Enright said. "If judgments are to have any 
validity at all, if courts mean anything at all, they must have the ability to 
enter final judgments." 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication late Wednesday when the 9th Circuit would take up 
Harris' case. It was likely that any hearing in the case would be conducted by 
telephone, Sevilla said.

STATE AUDITOR SAYS IMPERIAL BEACH FACES A TIDE OF RED INK; 
</P>
<P>
DEBT: REPORT PREDICTS THE CITY WILL BE BROKE BY 1992 UNLESS IT TURNS OVER ITS 
BEACHFRONT TO THE PORT DISTRICT. A $4.5-MILLION LOAN WOULDN'T HURT, EITHER. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Imperial Beach will go broke by January, 1992, unless the Legislature allows 
the financially strapped municipality to give away its beachfront -- which 
costs more than $1.2 million a year in upkeep -- to the San Diego Unified Port 
District, a state auditor general's report says. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released Wednesday, also suggests that the biggest boost the state 
could give to Imperial Beach would be to combine the beachfront giveaway with a 
state loan of $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's immediate financial condition would dramatically improve if the 
city were to transfer its tidelands to the Port District and take out the loan 
from the State," the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the transfer of the tidelands alone would improve the city's 
financial condition to such an extent that it would mitigate the need for an 
emergency loan in the near term," it says. 
</P>
<P>
The report comes just one week before legislators are scheduled to consider a 
bailout for the strapped San Diego County border city of 24,500 residents. The 
beachfront giveaway and loan proposals are contained in two bills recently 
introduced by Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Bonita) and set for hearings before separate 
Senate committees. 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh and Imperial Beach City Manager Ronald C. Jack said Wednesday that they 
were encouraged by the auditor general's report, especially since it 
underscores the need for the city to divest itself of the title and financial 
responsibility for its 3 1/2-mile coastline, which stretches from the beginning 
of the Silver Strand to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have estimated that turning over the oceanfront to the port -- 
which already has responsibility for most of the other San Diego area tidelands 
-- would save Imperial Beach between $1.2 million and $1.5 million annually, or 
about 30% of the municipal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Relieved of that burden, the report says, the city could expect to pull itself 
out of the red ink starting next year and stockpile a $1.2-million surplus by 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted, because it tells us that if we are successful in transferring 
the tidelands to the Port Commission, that the major burden on the shoulder of 
Imperial Beach will be removed," Deddeh said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), who formally requested the audit 
last year, said: "It shows the importance of the transfer of the wetlands. If 
we can have that occur, then, with some real diligent belt tightening, we can 
probably help in a fashion that will bring (Imperial Beach) to solvency and 
avert disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach City Councilman Bud Harbin said Wednesday that the auditor 
general's report is important because it will help persuade skeptical residents 
that the city really is teetering on the brink of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the big problems we've had down here is convincing the people that we 
are on the verge of bankruptcy," Harbin said. "The city has cried wolf in the 
past, and we were able to sidestep it with layoffs and whatever . . . so now 
the people's attitude is, 'They (officials) say that, but they're not going 
bankrupt.' " 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach's financial troubles developed over the past decade as city 
fathers engaged in deficit spending by consistently dipping into financial 
reserves to make up for shortfalls in municipal revenues. The problems have 
been compounded by other miscues, such as a $300,000 beating the city took in 
1986 and 1987 on bad stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the council tried a bold move to lift itself out of the financial 
quagmire by approving a $2.9-million plan to refurbish its 1,500-foot fishing 
pier, with promises of leasing it out to commercial ventures. But the rosy 
predictions of rental income have yet to materialize, and now the city is faced 
with another $356,000 in annual bond payments with no rental income to offset 
the debt. 
</P>
<P>
State auditors also criticized the city for passing budgets that were 
unrealistic. They also said the city's accounting department failed to spot 
potential losses early enough, and that municipal administrators were not 
aggressive enough in seeking out the city's share of some federal and state 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The report also suggests that the city try to boost its tax base by stimulating 
economic development along 13th Street, rewriting ordinances "that tend to 
force business out of Imperial Beach," and raise its fees for some municipal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city's past failings, the auditors gave Imperial Beach's new 
administration good marks for scrambling to enact or raise fees on fire 
inspection, development and sewer connections -- moves that will net the city 
$610,000 in new money this year. They also applauded the move to a new 
cost-accounting system. 
</P>
<P>
Even with those improvements, the report warns, Imperial Beach will go broke 
without outside intervention. At the current pace, the city's general fund will 
be $83,000 in the hole by June, forcing administrators to tap cash reserves 
that could be exhausted by January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, the city would be technically insolvent," the report says. 
"That is, if the city was a business, it would be bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
Simply giving the city a $4.5-million state loan, at 8% interest, would only 
prolong the agony for a little while, the report says. Avoiding long-term 
insolvency is pegged on allowing the city to get rid of its beachfront, it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city would continue to maintain and patrol the beach, the Port 
District would reimburse Imperial Beach approximately $850,000 a year for the 
services, the report says. In addition, the district would take over the annual 
bond payments for the fishing pier. 
</P>
<P>
"What they say in the report has taken me a year to figure out," said City 
Manager Jack, who was hired in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The auditor general's office, which conducts fiscal reviews for the 
Legislature, hired the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young, along with Macias 
and Pierini, to perform the audit.

CITY AND COUNTY SIGN ACCORD ON PRIVATE JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the city and county of San Diego on Wednesday signed a 
memorandum of understanding that clears the way for the city to build a 
$6.5-million jail on county-owned land on East Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The city will now begin negotiations with Wackenhut Corp., a Coral Gables, 
Fla.-based firm, to build and operate the jail. Funding, however, remains a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the facility is needed because there is no longer space 
available to house people arrested on misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the facility would house 200 people who have been arrested but not 
arraigned on such charges. The city might also contract with other cities for 
space to house another 200 inmates, according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
The facility would be the first privately owned and operated jail in 
California, according to correctional officials. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday agreed to amend its Criminal 
Justice Master Plan to include the temporary jail. Eventually, the building 
would be turned over to the county to use as part of a planned jail complex in 
the area, according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
The memo also says the city would use Proposition A sales-tax proceeds to pay 
for construction of the facility. The measure was narrowly passed by voters in 
1988, but was ruled illegal last year by a Riverside County judge because it 
had not passed by the two-thirds majority required. An appeal of that ruling is 
expected to go to the state Supreme Court, and could take two years. 
</P>
<P>
The county has agreed to reimburse the city for certain costs if Proposition A 
funds do not materialize and the county subsequently wins support for 
additional jail funds. 
</P>
<P>
City officials believe the new jail is needed to house an increasing number of 
suspects who remain free because of a lack of space. The county, however, is 
concerned that the new city complex would increase the number of inmates, 
further burdening the county's already overcrowded criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Sheriff's Department, the new facility would increase workloads for 
the county court system and the public defender's office, according to the 
county's chief administrator's office. 
</P>
<P>
While California law prohibits the county from contracting out the management 
of its jails to the private sector, the county counsel's office recently 
determined that the sheriff could contract for beds in the city's proposed 
jail.

MURDER-SUICIDE FINAL WORD ON PAIR OF EDUCATORS;

San Diego police Wednesday closed the investigation into the deaths of two San 
Diego school administrators, calling it a murder-suicide after a week of 
investigation that turned up personal writings by Assistant Supt. George Frey. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Frey, 57, and Elizabeth Alene (Betty) Tomblin, 43 -- another 
official of the city school district -- were found shot in the head at Frey's 
home 11 days ago. Frey, who had been divorced three times, and Tomblin, who was 
married, purportedly were romantically involved. 
</P>
<P>
Police have adhered to their preliminary conclusion of murder-suicide, which 
was reached by the six-member homicide team, a coroner and a forensic 
pathologist 10 hours after finding the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion from the evidence is that George Frey shot Elizabeth Tomblin 
and then used the same gun to kill himself. Period," said Lt. Gary Learn of the 
homicide unit. 
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Wednesday by police, "The possibility that 
this crime was committed by another person was thoroughly pursued, but 
absolutely no evidence of this was found." 
</P>
<P>
Frey's writings helped police ascertain the unfolding of events, the release 
said. The writings included a diary and a letter to his daughter, one source 
said. The contents of those writings have not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Although police closed the case Wednesday, they declined to answer a number of 
questions. They will not reveal who owned the .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol 
found next to the bodies. Nor will they say who notified them that Tomblin's 
car was parked outside Frey's Oak Park home. 
</P>
<P>
Frey and Tomblin were romantically involved over the years, friends and a 
police official say. The two had begun breaking up in December, said one friend 
of Frey, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"George cared very much for her," said the friend, who added that Frey had 
discussed his frustration at being at the same social events as Tomblin but 
having to mask the nature of their relationship. Tomblin directed the 
district's program evaluations department. 
</P>
<P>
While Frey was involved with Tomblin, he also dated other women, friends said, 
but they added that they were uncertain whether that was an effort to conceal 
his relationship with Tomblin, a tall, athletic blonde who introduced him to 
skiing. Over the years, the two took a number of ski trips together, including 
a 10-day vacation last spring to Innsbruck, Austria, the friend said. The pair 
made the trip when 25 members of a ski club organized by the school district 
went to Austria. Club members, however, stayed in a different village. 
</P>
<P>
Frey and Tomblin "were being discreet," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation of a romance between Frey and Tomblin surprised some, including 
those who considered themselves their friends. Some flinched at learning what 
had been a carefully guarded secret, while others said it was simply not 
possible. The disclosure also complicated what had almost overnight become a 
controversial case. 
</P>
<P>
Believing police had too hastily labeled the case a murder-suicide, some black 
leaders last week called for further investigation and even threatened to hire 
a private investigator. Also last week, seven members of the Black Federation 
picketed outside the police station in an effort to persuade police to more 
rigorously investigate the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Cawthorne, the federation's chief executive officer, said he now feels 
police have adequately investigated the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a question not of police competence but of community confidence," 
Cawthorne said. "There are things obviously that police cannot tell us or 
anyone for the sake of the privacy of the families. But we were satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Walker Smith, who conducted a memorial service for Frey on 
Sunday, said he will no longer be pursuing the case and will not hire a private 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's closed," said Smith, who had known Frey for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a printed release, police spokesman Dave Cohen said Wednesday that the 
preliminary conclusion by police was based on more than "50 hours of combined 
investigative time. The evidence to support this conclusion was compelling, and 
the determination to make the release was made in order to allay community 
concerns that a multiple murderer might be at large." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the brouhaha over the case, he said, it was handled no differently than 
any other major homicide. "That is, it was thoroughly and completely 
investigated," said Cohen, who added that police findings were buttressed by 
autopsies, information obtained by detectives and Frey's writings. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Frey and Tomblin were found along a short stairway leading to a 
sunken first-floor bedroom in Frey's home. Frey had fallen on top of Tomblin, 
who had also been shot in the left thigh. 
</P>
<P>
Tomblin's husband, Douglas, a Bonita veterinarian who lives in La Mesa, 
declined to return calls from a reporter. Douglas Tomblin, who neighbors say 
has left town, reported his wife missing March 16 after she did not come home 
from work. The next day, he filed another report with the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
One police official said last week that Douglas Tomblin had been unaware that 
his wife was having an affair.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MARITIME MUSEUM NEAR COMPLETION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH HARLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture a warm summer day at Channel Islands Harbor. In the square at 
Fisherman's Wharf, in front of the Maritime Museum in Oxnard, a young boat 
builder is splitting planks for a Chumash canoe. Another is readying tar to 
seal the hull. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, visitors peek into glass cases housing replicas of the H.M.S. Bounty, 
the Mayflower, famous galleons and well-armed frigates. Others study the brush 
lines of 19th-Century maritime art. Still others punch into museum computers, 
playing with ship-design programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Dynamic," says Frank Crane, Maritime Museum executive director. The new 
museum, scheduled to open this summer, will be ever-changing. Outdoors, it will 
host shipbuilding demonstrations; indoors, it will house maritime art, ship 
models, computers, a library and video displays. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years after it was conceived, the museum, at Channel Islands 
Boulevard and Victoria Avenue, is nearing reality. It will be housed in a 
5,000-square-foot building donated by Martin V. (Bud) Smith, the owner of 
Fisherman's Wharf restaurant, on a site leased at $1 a year for 50 years by the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The ballast of the museum's collection is already on board, including a 
$500,000 historical ship model collection, a maritime art collection valued at 
$5 million and a 1,000-book library, all on loan from Harry L. Nelson Jr., 
owner of Almar Ltd., whose assets include eight West Coast marinas. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Parks and Harbor Foundation, a nonprofit corporation formed 
in 1979, was selected by Ventura County to oversee the museum. Fund raising is 
in progress toward a projected 1989-92 budget of $4 million, with more than 
$250,000 now in hand. 
</P>
<P>
What will make the museum unique is its "ability not to be weighed down by the 
past," said Michael Koutnik, owner of the Whale's Tail Restaurant and a museum 
board member. The museum's mission statement spells out its commitment to 
sailing "past, present and future." 
</P>
<P>
"We will use computers to show how boats are designed," Crane said. Today's 
designers use computer images to "build" new concepts. The Killer Wasp, a 
futuristic vessel that is now only an image on a computer screen, although an 
exciting one, incorporates hydrofoil capabilities with a revolutionary 
seven-winged sailing device, Crane said. It's expected to run at 63 knots in a 
25-knot wind. 
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Museum will also display photographs and papers from the latest 
Stanford University meeting of Sail Tech, a think tank that meets biannually to 
compare research on the latest developments in sailing. 
</P>
<P>
And for sailing buffs, the museum will feature videos of sailboat races, with 
special emphasis on those races in season, focusing on the America's Cup, for 
example, when that race is running. 
</P>
<P>
"We see possibilities of getting involved with the Ventura County Ocean Racing 
Circuit too," Crane said. "One of our charges is to show what is going on 
today, what it is like to go cruising, what it's like to race, to get a feeling 
of what you can do." JUDITH HARLAN

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER HELD IN SHOOTING AT CAR DURING 
DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Sylmar man was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of shooting at a 
car during a traffic dispute in Newhall, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Casillas allegedly fired a pistol shot into the fender of another auto, 
carrying three people, at San Fernando Road and 13th Street, said Sgt. Greg 
Sisneros. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred after the other driver gestured to protest Casillas' 
cutting in front of him, Sisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
Casillas was being held in lieu of $17,000 bail on suspicion of shooting at an 
occupied vehicle, assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a contraband 
weapon, a pair of brass knuckles, authorities reported.

TAR BALLS ON N. COUNTY BEACH PUZZLE OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Small tar balls have washed onto a five-mile stretch of beach in North County, 
sparking a U. S. Coast Guard investigation into its source and causing joggers 
to watch their step. 
</P>
<P>
The oil was first noticed Tuesday at Camp Pendleton and by Wednesday afternoon 
had moved to the southern edge of Oceanside's city beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard investigators, who were sending samples of the oil to a laboratory 
for analysis, said they were unsure whether it may be the result of natural 
seepage from the ocean floor or from an ocean-going ship. But local officials 
said there was no reason to link the tar balls with last month's tanker spill 
off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside city officials characterized the oil as more of a nuisance than 
anything else, and sent two beach-sweeping machines onto the strand to remove 
the goo. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding dabs here and there," City Hall spokesman Larry Bauman said. 
"The biggest ones are the size of small, misshapen cookies." 
</P>
<P>
He said the city was notified of the oil Tuesday by Camp Pendleton officials, 
who discovered the oil on their own beaches. The city sent out its Harbor 
Patrol boats to search for a slick, but none was found. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton officials said the oil began appearing about 2 p.m. Tuesday. "It 
was nothing very significant," said Staff Sgt. John Midgette, a base spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"Our natural-resources people went out to look at it again this morning, but it 
was all gone," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was no danger to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside's Bauman said lifeguards found three dead birds on the beach 
Wednesday, but that it was unclear whether any had been oiled and that one or 
two dead birds are usually found every day. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the state Department of Fish and Game said they knew of no 
unusual problems caused by the oil. The Coast Guard could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Natural oil seepage from fissures in the ocean floor is not unusual. Off Santa 
Barbara, more than 2,000 gallons of crude oil leaks from the ocean floor daily, 
according to Coast Guard estimates.

UNSAFE NITRATE LEVELS FOUND IN SCHOOL WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bottled-water dispensers were installed at Rio Del Valle Junior High School in 
Oxnard Wednesday after unsafe nitrate levels were found in drinking water drawn 
from a campus well. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Rio Elementary School District plan to meet today with the 
United Water Conservation District of Santa Paula to discuss temporary water 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
A line operated by the water district runs along Rose Avenue in front of the 
school. Connecting the school to it will take about two weeks, Assistant Supt. 
Fernando Cuevas said. 
</P>
<P>
The school district's board of trustees will discuss emergency authorization to 
spend $20,000 for the connection at its meeting next week, Cuevas said. The 
connection will remain in place through the end of the school year. Officials 
will discuss possible long-term solutions next summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Letters were sent Wednesday to parents of the school's 470 seventh- and 
eighth-grade students, informing them that bottled water is being provided for 
drinking, said Supt. John McGarry. Well water will continue to be used in 
restrooms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said nitrate levels in the drinking water were 112 
milligrams per liter, more than twice the maximum of 45 milligrams per liter 
set as the safety standard by state law. 
</P>
<P>
A high nitrate level can cause "blue-baby syndrome" in infants under 6 months, 
affecting the blood's ability to carry oxygen, but does not pose a similar 
hazard to older children or adults, said Robert Gallagher, resources section 
manager of the county's environmental health department. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires well water quality to be checked every three years. 
</P>
<P>
The school is surrounded by strawberry fields, and sparse rainfall may have 
lowered the water table and caused nitrates -- which are often contained in 
farm fertilizer -- to seep from ground water into wells, McGarry said. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Gary Martino said although no one reported becoming ill from the 
water, students and staff have complained that it was "not very palatable."

DISTRICT WITHDRAWS REVISIONS ON HIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM MOSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Board members of the Moorpark Unified School District have joined a persistent 
NAACP critic of the district's equal opportunity employment policy, forcing 
administrators to withdraw proposed revisions. 
</P>
<P>
The substance of the policy was criticized at a meeting Tuesday, as well as its 
implementation by district officials. Board members questioned whether 
administrators were doing enough to recruit minority workers to balance the 
current overwhelming majority of non-minority district employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy. This doesn't make me comfortable in terms of where we are right 
now," said board member Pamela Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 213 teachers in the district, 184 are white, 20 are Latinos, seven are 
Asian and two are black. Out of other workers, 138 are white, 65 Latino, four 
Asian, one American Indian and one black. 
</P>
<P>
Management is made up of 30 whites and five Latinos, according to data 
presented at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to the board debate, Supt. Thomas Duffy withdrew the proposed 
revisions, which had earlier drawn the ire of a black leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an insult to all decent human beings," said Theodore Green Sr., a 
member of the Ventura chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People and the parent of a Moorpark High School student. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators contended that the revision was needed to conform to 
recent court decisions, eliminate unnecessary language "and still do the same 
thing" as the current policy, said Chuck Smith, assistant superintendent of 
curriculum and instructional services. 
</P>
<P>
But several board members suggested that the new policy would have placed less 
emphasis on the need to recruit minority employees. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the board suggested the district should show a preference for hiring 
minority candidates with lesser qualifications who could act as role models for 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Sam Nainoa noted there are no Latino counselors at Moorpark High 
School. Latinos make up 28% of the district's 4,800-student population, 
according to Assistant Supt. Charles Smith. 
</P>
<P>
But board member Patty Waters said the district would have to pay higher 
salaries to compete for well-qualified minority candidates. Demand is high and 
the pool is small, according to Waters. ADAM MOSS

DOCTOR ACCUSED OF TURNING AWAY ILL, POOR PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former emergency room surgeon at Panorama Community Hospital is facing 
charges that he turned away a critically ill patient because the patient could 
not afford treatment, The Times has learned. It is the second time in recent 
months that medical personnel at the hospital have been accused of such illegal 
patient "dumping." 
</P>
<P>
Felix Talag, who was 67 at the time, went to the Panorama City hospital on 
April 11, 1987, because he had been vomiting blood for more than seven hours 
and felt dizzy, an accusation filed by the Medical Board of California states. 
Dr. Stephen C. Acosta briefly examined Talag at the hospital and then told his 
relatives to drive him in their own car to Olive View Medical Center, a Los 
Angeles County facility 10 miles away that treats indigent patients for reduced 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
There, doctors found that Talag had no palpable pulse or blood pressure, the 
complaint says. Doctors managed to resuscitate him and he was placed in Olive 
View's intensive care unit, the accusation states. Talag has since recovered, 
said Gloria Barrios, the deputy state attorney general who is handling the case 
on behalf of the Medical Board. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, which was obtained by The Times, states that Acosta allowed 
Talag to be transferred because he "was concerned" that the patient "could not 
pay for the required hospitalization." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, of Redondo Beach, could lose his medical license if the charges are 
upheld at a hearing before a Medical Board panel in Los Angeles next Wednesday. 
He is accused of negligence, incompetence and general unprofessional conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, as well as the hospital, could each be fined $50,000 by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, which found out about the Acosta 
incident while conducting its own investigation into the hospital's procedures, 
said Elliott Kramer, the department's regional inspector general for 
investigations. The state Medical Board heard about the incident from an Olive 
View doctor who complained. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, who no longer works at Panorama hospital, is not listed as a member of 
the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., and it could not be determined whether he 
is still practicing. The state medical board issued him a physician's and 
surgeon's certificate in October, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama hospital spokeswoman Candyce Columbus declined to comment on the 
charges. Acosta could not be reached for comment. His attorneys, David Kalifon 
and John Harwell, said they could not comment on the charges until next week's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
After diagnosing the symptoms as an "acute episode of gastrointestinal 
bleeding," Acosta allegedly failed to stabilize Talag and sent him to Olive 
View, in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"Panorama Community Hospital had all the requisite staff and facilities 
necessary to determine the extent and acuity" of Felix Talag's bleeding and to 
stabilize his condition, according to the complaint, which was issued last May. 
"This was not done," it says. 
</P>
<P>
The incident came to light less than six months after a registered nurse at 
Panorama Community Hospital was charged with denying care to a seriously ill 
girl, whom she allegedly sent to Olive View after the girl's parents failed to 
prove that they had insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer would not say if the department's investigation has uncovered other 
so-called "dumping" incidents at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Carol Nachman, 37, of Sherman Oaks is scheduled to stand trial April 30 
on a misdemeanor charge of failing to treat Veronica Ayala, now 2, when the 
girl was rushed to the hospital on Dec. 8, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala lost one foot and the toes of the other to gangrene, which resulted from 
a contagious blood infection, said Deputy City Atty. Ellen Pais. 
</P>
<P>
Pais said that although it could not be proven that the girl lost her foot 
because she was not treated at Panorama, the girl should have received 
immediate care because her condition was critical.

ACTION DELAYED ON HISTORIC STATUS FOR VAN NUYS HANGARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debate over the historic value of two hangars at Van Nuys Airport prompted the 
Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission to postpone action Wednesday on a 
request to preserve the aging structures. 
</P>
<P>
Commission President Armajit Marwah delayed a decision for a month after city 
Department of Airports officials, who want to raze the hangars, argued the 
preservation effort is a ploy by the corporate tenant occupying the buildings, 
Volpar Aircraft Corp., to save millions of dollars in relocation costs. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation was denied by executives of Volpar, which retrofits jet aircraft 
and is operating under a five-year lease on the site. Volpar officials and 
Commissioner Helen Madrid-Worthen of Woodland Hills argued that the hangars 
bore witness to San Fernando Valley aviation history. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Cultural Heritage Commission agreed to continue the hearing at a 
meeting May 2. If the hangars are deemed monuments, efforts to demolish them 
can be delayed up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The hangars were built in 1943 by the Lockheed Corp. Through the years, they 
were used in production of B-24 bombers, T-33 training planes, F-94 Starfire 
fighters and the Army's Cheyenne helicopters, said Volpar President A.E. Savva. 
The site was also home to Lockheed's missile division, and U-2 spy planes were 
serviced in the hangars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheryl Meshack, an assistant city attorney for the city's Department of 
Airports, told commissioners the effort to protect the hangars was a ploy by 
Volpar to halt department plans to redevelop the property. 
</P>
<P>
John Malloy, a real estate agent for the Airports Department, said Volpar would 
save "millions of dollars" in relocation costs by staying at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Malloy said granting monument status would keep the department from building 
other aviation-related structures on the site that could bring the city 
$300,000 to $750,000 more per year in revenue. The department is seeking bids 
from about 25 groups interested in leasing and developing the property. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Harold Becks said he was "concerned about the ultimate cost to 
taxpayers" if the hangars were preserved. "It's a lot of land to put aside . . 
. when the cultural significance is in doubt," Becks said. 
</P>
<P>
Savva, whose firm filed an application to preserve the hangars, told 
commissioners that the Department of Airports said in documents in 1979 that 
the hangars were historic. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Harnett, an attorney for Volpar, said the five-member commission should 
remember that old hangars at Santa Monica Airport, formerly the site of a large 
McDonnell Douglas production plant, had been demolished. "Perhaps a token of 
that era ought to be preserved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Madrid-Worthen said the hangars are a source of aviation history in the San 
Fernando Valley. She said that in the decades after World War II, aircraft 
manufacturing grew from a fledgling Valley industry to one that played a large 
role in the area's life and economy. 
</P>
<P>
But the architecture of the hangars was not special enough to warrant 
preservation, Marwah argued. As for history: "Three or four decades is not that 
old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marwah was reminded by cultural heritage staff and by private citizens that the 
commission had recently designated a 40-year-old house in Pacific Palisades as 
a landmark.

FISHERMEN SAY BAN ON BOMBS WILL DO DOLPHINS MORE HARM THAN GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tuna industry representatives reacted angrily Wednesday to a new government ban 
on the use of explosives that have long been used to manipulate dolphins 
swimming near schools of the fish. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that this (ruling) does more harm than good," said Bob 
Virissimo, chairman of the board of the American Tunaboat Assn., the San 
Diego-based trade group representing the owners of the 29 U. S. vessels that 
fish for tuna in the Eastern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
In outlawing the three-inch-long devices, U. S. regulatory authorities ruled 
that the bombs pose a threat to the dolphins -- a view disputed by the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Tuna fishermen say the ban, which goes into effect today, could result in even 
greater harm to the marine mammals because it takes away a means to help them 
escape from tuna nets. 
</P>
<P>
However, conservationists dispute the fishermen's position, saying the bombs 
injure dolphins and that the benefits of the explosives accrue more to the 
fishermen than to the dolphins. The new prohibition will save many dolphins, 
according to one prominent environmentalist, who acknowledged that the ban may 
make it more difficult for fishermen to catch tuna. 
</P>
<P>
"We completely support a full ban" on the bombs, said David Phillips, director 
of the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute. "They'd probably catch more 
tuna if they used depth charges, too, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. . 
. . We think continuing use of these bombs would be unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
August Felando, president of the American Tunaboat Assn., contends there is "no 
evidence whatsoever" that the devices, "as used by fishermen," cause any injury 
to dolphins. That view was disputed by Phillips, who cited studies showing that 
the bombs have blown holes in dolphin carcasses used in tests. 
</P>
<P>
The National Marine Fisheries Service, which enacted the ban, issued a 
statement saying that studies concluded that the explosives "could result in 
obvious physical damage to the animals as well as possible hearing impairment." 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities say fishermen use the so-called seal bombs for three basic 
purposes: to herd schools of dolphins (and therefore the tuna) toward the huge 
nets, to keep dolphins in certain "safe" areas of the nets and to drive 
dolphins out of the nets after the tuna have been captured. 
</P>
<P>
The bombs, tossed from boats and helicopters, have been in use for more than a 
decade, fishermen say. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Congress mandated that the Commerce Department, parent body of the 
fisheries service, prohibit or restrict the use of seal bombs if research 
determined that the devices injured dolphins. That congressional action 
ultimately resulted in the new ban. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign-registered tuna vessels, which make up the great majority of the world 
tuna-fishing fleet, have 180 days to comply with the prohibition. Foreign 
fishermen who continue to fish with the bombs face possible bans on import of 
tuna into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The fisheries service will take comment on the new ban for the next 30 days. 
Thereafter, the regulation will be modified or made final, although tuna 
industry representatives voiced little hope that they could effect major 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
For unknown reasons, yellowtail tuna tend to congregate beneath schools of 
dolphin in the Eastern Pacific between Southern California and Chile. That fact 
has long been known to fishermen, who set their vast purse-seine nets around 
the dolphins, capturing them together with the tuna. Many dolphins perish. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, conservationists estimate that tuna fishermen worldwide kill 100,000 
dolphins that become trapped in nets.

OUSTED CITY MANAGER A FINALIST FOR TEXAS JOB; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: DAVID MORA IS A COMPETING FOR THE SAME POSITION IN SAN ANTONIO. BUT 
THIS HAS NOT CHANGED THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO WANT HIM OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Less than four months after he was asked to leave his post in Oxnard, City 
Manager David Mora has beaten out more than 55 competitors to become a finalist 
for the same position in San Antonio -- the nation's ninth-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
But Mora's chance of being hired by San Antonio, where he will be interviewed 
this weekend, has not altered the opinions of some who wanted him out of 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got no second thoughts," said Councilwoman Ann Johs, who voted with 
Councilwomen Dorothy Maron and Geraldine Furr against Mora in December. 
</P>
<P>
Mora, who has been blamed by some council members for the city's financial 
crisis, will leave Oxnard on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said Mora had some excellent qualities and "came across great" in 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, he just didn't work out well for us," Johs said. 
</P>
<P>
Maron said she thought Mora did a good job but believed he had made too many 
concessions to developers. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, essentially our difficulty was in philosophy more than anything 
else," Maron said. "I wish Mr. Mora luck." 
</P>
<P>
Mora's supporters said San Antonio's consideration of him proves that he is a 
good manager who was blamed unfairly for Oxnard's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that he has been the best city manager that we've dealt with in terms 
of being open and knowledgeable about finances," said Councilman Manuel Lopez, 
who is in his 12th year in office. "When they asked me what I wanted in a new 
city manager, I said, 'Look at what we have and duplicate that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi, who also voted to keep Mora, said Mora's position as a 
finalist in the San Antonio search demonstrates his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly speaks well for the qualities and qualifications of Mr. Mora," 
Takasugi said. "That's major league." 
</P>
<P>
Mora was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mora will be interviewed Saturday in San Antonio, where he is one of eight 
finalists for the managerial post in the city of about 900,000. 
</P>
<P>
The San Antonio City Council is searching for "someone with management 
background, who has a given level of financial experience and multi-ethnic or 
cultural experience," said Skip Noe, director of management services for San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Salary for the city manager is negotiable depending on experience. However, 
Louis J. Fox, San Antonio's current city manager, has a base salary of 
$106,000. That does not include incidental or car expenses, Noe said. 
</P>
<P>
Mora now makes $95,700 in base salary with an additional $7,500 in deferred 
funds and $3,600 for a car. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, who has held the San Antonio post for eight years, will leave June 1 to 
become director of the department of urban studies at Trinity University in San 
Antonio, Noe said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, debate over Mora's ouster continues in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
An Oxnard group calling itself Community Concern has launched a recall effort 
against Maron and vowed to campaign against Johs' reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
Community Concern, consisting of organizations such as the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People and the Assn. of Mexican-American Educators, 
claims that the council majority has not adequately explained the reasons for 
firing the city manager, who is a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
But the council members opposed to Mora, who toppled him in a bitter 3-2 
council vote, have refused on the advice of legal counsel to describe their 
reasons for the ouster. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came after weeks of surprise disclosures about the city's confused 
and desperate financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
The city lost $9 million, or 75% of its emergency reserve funds, during a 
four-year period, forcing the council to make more than $1 million in 
politically unpopular cuts this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Maron also has indicated that Mora was making too many concessions to 
developers in city deals. 
</P>
<P>
Mora came to Oxnard in 1985, from Los Gatos, Calif., where he was town manager. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived, the City Council had just ousted his predecessor. At the time, 
two council members were being recalled over an unpopular utility tax and 
residents were angered by fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Mora will leave the city in July after helping the council with its $6,000 
nationwide search for his replacement. Eight finalists chosen by a consultant 
will be presented for council consideration in late April or May.

FAIR'S EX-MANAGER FACES REDUCED CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former manager of the Antelope Valley Fair in Lancaster entered a plea of 
no contest Wednesday to a misdemeanor grand theft charge as part of a plea 
bargain with prosecutors to drop felony embezzlement charges. 
</P>
<P>
C.W. Adams, 48, had been charged with embezzling public funds in the purchase 
of materials to build a $700 fence around his house in 1986 and to buy $500 
worth of tires for two private vehicles in 1988. Adams, who retired as fair 
manager last April after budget irregularities surfaced, allegedly used fair 
funds in both instances. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was also charged with altering fair records on the eve of an audit by 
state officials -- the fair is under the auspices of the state -- to conceal 
unpaid utility debts of more than $50,000, according to the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
That charge was dropped in a hearing on Monday before Lancaster Municipal Court 
Judge Frank Jackson in exchange for Adams' no contest plea to a single count of 
misdemeanor grand theft. Attorneys told the judge that Adams has agreed to pay 
back the embezzled $1,200 plus a fine of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Adams' lack of prior offenses and the relatively small amount 
embezzled, prosecutors said they have also agreed to ask for no jail time when 
Adams appears for sentencing May 11. He could be sentenced to up to 60 days in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley said a key factor in the reduction of 
charges was that in the most serious offense, the alteration of public records, 
Adams appeared to have been trying to make the fair's finances look better, 
rather than to conceal a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not appear to have been done for fraudulent purposes for self-gain," 
Cooley said. "But for the fact that we did file the one charge of falsification 
of an account of public monies, the case would probably not have been pursued 
as a felony, given the amounts taken." 
</P>
<P>
Adams declined to comment.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KIDNAPED MAN JUMPS FROM MOVING CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said Wednesday they are looking for a man 
who forced a Valencia man at gunpoint into his own car, fired shots near his 
feet, robbed him of $20 and pistol-whipped him. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong ordeal began in Newhall and ended in Mission Hills when Mall 
Singh, 53, opened his car door and hurled himself onto the street at Rinaldi 
Street and Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
He was treated at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills for facial cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Singh was stepping out of his white, 1990 Toyota Supra on Tuesday about 2:30 
p.m. in front of the Newhall Post Office on 8th Street, when a man ordered him 
at gunpoint to move over and keep his head down, Deputy Dean Scoville said. The 
man then took the wheel and drove to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Singh told deputies the man pulled the turban Singh was wearing down over his 
eyes, took his wallet containing $20 and several credit cards, and fired four 
shots into the floor of the car near his feet. Singh was ordered to strip to 
his underwear and was hit on the head with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Singh hurled himself from the moving vehicle. The suspect fled in the car. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it was a desperate bid for freedom" by Singh, Scoville said. "The 
car wasn't stopped."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VANDALS HIT SCHOOL FOR 4TH WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vandals have struck Hazeltine Avenue Elementary School in Van Nuys on four 
consecutive weekends, causing police to increase patrols at the school and to 
ask neighbors and parents to watch for unusual activity at the site. 
</P>
<P>
About $3,500 worth of property, which included videocassette recorders, speaker 
systems and computers has been stolen in the series of break-ins, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, about $850 in damage was done to the school buildings, school 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazeltine Principal Nathan Glickman said four suspects in the latest vandalism, 
which occurred last weekend, have been identified. But Glickman and school 
police said they are unsure whether those suspects, who have not been arrested, 
were responsible for the series of incidents. The suspects are young adults, 
Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens so frequently," Glickman said of the recent incidents. "They simply 
destroy the interior of the room, spray-painting it, throwing out the desks or 
tearing open files. They discharge fire extinguishers in the room. It's 
complete vandalism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Page, assistant chief of the Los Angeles Unified School District 
police, said that security officials are "increasing coverage of patrol stops" 
near the school in response to the vandalism.

San Diego will conduct a six-month test in residential areas to determine 
whether speed bumps control speeders. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's Transportation and Land Use Committee on Monday approved 
spending $12,000 to install the bumps on two streets in Skyline and Paradise 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The bumps are typically 3 inches high, 4 feet wide and 12 feet long. Thousand 
Oaks, Pasadena and Sacramento have undertaken similar projects. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt expects the bumps to be an inexpensive alternative to 
using police to chase speeders.

OCEANSIDE TEEN TO STAND TRIAL IN WOUNDING OF 4-YEAR-OLD

<P>
An 18-year-old Oceanside resident was ordered Wednesday to stand trial in 
Superior Court on charges related to a drive-by shooting that wounded a 
4-year-old girl on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
During two days of testimony at a preliminary hearing, a witness said Floyd 
Avery was among a small group of San Juan Capistrano teen-agers who passed 
around a sawed-off shotgun before embarking on a hunt for rival gang members in 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Avery allegedly drove the car at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Avery is charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Three other people have already been convicted in the shooting, which sent 
4-year-old Prisca Caudillo to the hospital for four days with shotgun wounds in 
her face and upper chest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say all three are members of a San Juan Capistrano gang known as 
the SJC Boys. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Rafael Gutierrez, an admitted San Juan Capistrano gang member, 
testified that Avery was with members of the SJC Boys when the shotgun was 
passed around after a party. 
</P>
<P>
After the shotgun was shown off, Avery jumped into his blue 1973 Datsun with 
two other teen-agers and drove to San Clemente, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that a short time later, the teen-agers made three attempts to shoot 
rival gang members, with the girl wounded in the second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Prisca and her father, Rodrigo Caudillo, 25, appeared during the first day of 
the preliminary hearing. The child fell asleep in a chair at the district 
attorney's table during her father's testimony. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: WITH JOHNSON WATCHING, CLIPPERS COME BACK FROM A 19-POINT 
HALFTIME DEFICIT TO LEAD AFTER THREE QUARTERS BEFORE LAKERS PREVAIL, 106-99.

He was reduced to Earvin Johnson Wednesday, for not even a Magic man could heal 
a badly sprained ankle in time to play, not this quickly. Check back in a 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates managed a little trickery anyway. Twenty-three points ahead in 
the second quarter, two behind after the third. Presto, Laker invincibility 
throughout Los Angeles, already proven to be a thing of the past, was being 
smacked around. 
</P>
<P>
They recovered just in time, soon enough to keep a half-game lead over Detroit 
for the best record in the NBA, soon enough to take a 2 1/2-game lead over idle 
Portland in the Pacific Division, soon enough to beat the Clippers, 106-99, 
before 15,350 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
In a game of several turns, the last one belonged to the Lakers (52-17). Taking 
advantage of the smaller lineup put in for outside shooting, they went from a 
38% success rate in the third quarter to 67% in the fourth. Not surprisingly, 
the scoring output jumped dramatically -- 18 to 33. 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy had 11 of his team-high 27 points in the fourth quarter. Michael 
Cooper had all of his nine. Byron Scott accounted for six of his 18 in that 
stretch, and together the three combined to go 10 for 15. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just too bad there weren't four or five balls out there at a time," 
Scott said. "It seemed like everyone was making their shots." 
</P>
<P>
Seemed like it to the Clippers, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the vets' time then and the veterans came though," Coach Don Casey said 
of the Lakers. "They hit some big-time shots." 
</P>
<P>
A big-time Clipper turnaround forced them to. Before that, no one could have 
dreamed up a finish to keep the capacity crowd around until the end. 
</P>
<P>
The only drama early belonged to Johnson -- whether he would play with the 
Lakers trying to avoid their third consecutive Sports Arena loss. 
</P>
<P>
The last time they visited -- Jan. 30 in an eventual 121-104 Clipper victory -- 
his status was uncertain before the game because of the flu, although he did 
end up playing 25 minutes. Wednesday, some 24 hours after twisting his right 
ankle at the Portland Coliseum, the decision didn't take nearly as long. He 
arrived in street clothes and never changed. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, he was under the weather again -- emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing feels good right now," Johnson said before the game. "I just want to 
be out there playing. In that regard, it doesn't feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Physically, though, it could have been worse. After keeping the ankle wrapped 
all night after the return from Oregon, Johnson moved without problem 
Wednesday. It only hurt when the foot turned. 
</P>
<P>
"The tenderness is bad," he said. "Other than that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
There were no predictions regarding Johnson's availability. He will be be 
examined again Friday before a determination is made if he can play against 
Portland at the Forum on Friday, but the Clipper game served as a gauge. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's like it is today, then no," Johnson said. "If there's improvement, 
maybe." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers also went without their starting point guard, Winston Garland, 
injured in overtime of Monday's victory over Minnesota. X-rays showed no breaks 
after a scary fall, but soreness in his hip, neck and head had worsened since 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pain soon became the common denominator among all Clippers, who fell behind, 
12-3, pulled even, and then trailed, 27-23, after the first quarter. That's the 
last they saw of the game for a while. 
</P>
<P>
From 38-32 midway through the second quarter, the Lakers, with Larry Drew at 
the point, went on a 17-0 run, Mychal Thompson getting six of the points. The 
Clippers went 4:50 without scoring and scored 13 points in the 12 minutes, all 
but three by Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
That beat their season low for points in a quarter by two. By intermission, the 
Clippers trailed, 55-36. That set a new mark for fewest points in a half. 
</P>
<P>
From this came . . . a thriller? 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers (27-44) put together their best quarter of the season, a 39-point 
effort that put them ahead, 75-73, and provided some of the best moments since 
Gary Grant and Ron Harper were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"We played about as well as we could without Earvin in the first half," Laker 
Coach Pat Riley said. "We were very focused defensively. But in the third 
quarter, we just kind of went haywire." 
</P>
<P>
Laker-Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Billy Tubbs, the first name into the rumor mill for the Clippers' expected 
coaching search, spent part of Tuesday with owner Donald T. Sterling. But, 
Sterling said, the Oklahoma coach was already in Los Angeles on other business 
and stopped by a Clipper party in Beverly Hills strictly on a social basis. . . 
. Because of the injury to Winston Garland, the Clippers had their third 
different starting lineup in four games. This time, it was Charles Smith, Ken 
Norman, Benoit Benjamin, Tom Garrick and Jeff Martin.

HARRINGTON TAKES JOB AT COLORADO; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CS LONG BEACH COACH SAYS HE WANTED A CHANCE TO COACH IN THE 
BIG EIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Cal State Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said Wednesday night that he has 
accepted an offer to become the basketball coach at the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it for two reasons," Harrington said. "For a chance to coach in the Big 
Eight, a great basketball conference, and because Colorado reminds me of where 
I went to school, at the University of Maryland." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, 44, who went to Long Beach from George Mason University in Fairfax, 
Va., was 53-36 in three seasons with the 49ers, turning around a program that 
had been down for years. 
</P>
<P>
This season he guided Long Beach to a 23-9 record -- its best in 16 years -- 
and a National Invitation Tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington had a second interview at Colorado Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a situation similar to the one I had when I took over at Long Beach," 
Harrington said. "They (Colorado's team) have been last in the conference the 
last five years." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, who replaces Tom Miller at Colorado, had also been a leading 
candidate for the coaching job at the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington did not say whether he received an offer from that school, but said, 
"I could have gone to Miami. I had a choice." 
</P>
<P>
The Miami job, which includes a shoe contract, was reportedly worth $200,000, 
almost three times what Harrington made at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He did not reveal the terms of his Colorado contract, but said it was 
comparable to the salary at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy to leave Long Beach," he said by phone from Denver. "But this 
is what I've worked for, to coach at a place like this. I just couldn't pass it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Athletic Director Corey Johnson said a decision on a new coach may 
be made today. 
</P>
<P>
Seth Greenberg, who has been Harrington's assistant, would appear to be the top 
candidate.

HE HAS ANSWERS FOR ALL THE BIG TALK; 
</P>
<P>
ARKANSAS: AT 270 POUNDS, OLIVER MILLER HEARS A LOT ABOUT HIS WEIGHT, BUT HE'S 
BIG ENOUGH TO HANDLE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The taunts began when Arkansas center Oliver Miller stepped to the free-throw 
line during the Razorbacks' 88-85 victory over Texas in the Midwest Regional 
final last weekend at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey Porky, want a hamburger?" a Texas fan shouted. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-9 and 270 pounds, Miller is accustomed to being teased about his 
weight and his fondness for junk food. 
</P>
<P>
"He says he weighs 270, but he won't let me see him on a scale," said Miller's 
mother, Annie. 
</P>
<P>
A Dallas newspaper columnist refers to Miller as "Old Cheeseburger Belly." 
</P>
<P>
When Arkansas played Baylor, fans threw hot dog wrappers and paper cups at the 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
And Miller expects more of the same from Duke's notorious fans when the 
Razorbacks face the Blue Devils in an NCAA semifinal game Saturday at Denver. 
Duke fans once threw a Twinkie at an overweight opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"If they throw me a Twinkie, I'm going to pick it up and give it to my manager, 
and eat it after the game," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
When Arkansas ran a fast-break drill with a medicine ball during practice, a 
fan joked that Miller's stomach was so big, it appeared that he had hidden the 
medicine ball under his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Do the barbs hurt Miller? 
</P>
<P>
"That really doesn't bother me," he said. "It pumps me up. If they mess with me 
about my weight, evidently they must like me. I can take a joke. My saying is, 
'If you can't take what you dish out, don't dish it out' -- and I dish out a 
lot of mess, so I can receive it." 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed the Big O, Miller was even bigger when practice began last October, 
reporting at 305 pounds. And that was after he had been on a diet. 
</P>
<P>
"During the summer, my mom told me to watch out for my weight, so all I ate 
were salads and fruit," Miller said. "When I came back to school, I just 
couldn't understand how I could weigh 305, because I really didn't eat that 
much back at home." 
</P>
<P>
Said Annie Miller: "I kept fruit in the house for his snacks, but I don't know 
what he ate when he left the house." 
</P>
<P>
Miller tried to work off the weight, wearing a sweat suit during practice. He 
also went on a one-meal-a-day diet. But instead of losing weight, he lost 
water, nearly passing out from dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'd take off the sweat suit, it was just like I'd had a bath," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors discovered that he had an overactive thyroid, and he lost 35 pounds 
after being placed on medication. He would like to shed even more pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'd be a whole lot better player because I'd be quicker and lighter on 
my feet," Miller said. "My role is to go into the game and block shots, and to 
block shots, you got to get off the floor. I feel if I get lighter, I can get 
higher and block more shots." 
</P>
<P>
His teammates are split on whether Miller should lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Credit, Arkansas' starting center, thinks Miller is the right size. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'd be a better player if he lost weight," Credit said. "He 
plays great at the weight he's at. I think he feels comfortable at the weight 
he's at now." 
</P>
<P>
But forward Lenzie Howell thinks Miller needs to lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
"If he does lose more weight, he could get a lot better," Howell said. "He 
would be more agile and he could do more things." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, Arkansas' best rebounder and shot-blocker, has thrown his weight around 
to help the Razorbacks reach the Final Four for the first time since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Miller scored 19 points, including 15 in the second half, as Arkansas defeated 
North Carolina in a Midwest Regional semifinal game last Friday. The most 
accurate shooter in the Southwest Conference this season, Miller made all seven 
of his shots and all five of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had only nine points and nine rebounds in the victory over Texas, 
Miller was a factor on defense, destroying the Longhorns' inside game as he 
helped force centers Guillermo (Panama) Myers and Hank Dudek to foul out. 
</P>
<P>
As the last line of defense for the Razorbacks, Miller waits to block shots if 
opponents break through the front court. What makes him such an intimidating 
defender? 
</P>
<P>
"He has the greatest pair of hands I've ever seen," Arkansas Coach Nolan 
Richardson said. "And he has great awareness of what's going on on the floor. 
There are a lot of things you can teach, but you can't teach awareness and 
instincts. Those are gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"And he's got great timing. He blocks a lot of shots, but he keeps them in 
play. Most guys block shots out of bounds. If you get past our front line of 
defense and get to the Big O, you pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go off on him, and I usually do, but when the chips are down, Big O 
seems to pay off." 
</P>
<P>
The Big O likes to pop off, too. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Midwest Regional, Miller predicted that Arkansas would have a free 
ticket to the Final Four if it met Texas in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing of Miller's prediction, Richardson was livid. Miller's mother 
also advised him to quit making predictions. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller plans to keep talking. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told me to stop making statements like that," he said. "But I backed it 
up. And I'll keep talking smack." 
</P>
<P>
Does Miller have any material for the Duke bulletin board? 
</P>
<P>
"Just tell them to watch out, because we're ready and we're on a mission," he 
said. "We've got one more goal to complete, and that's to win the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Duke has a good inside game, but if they come in with their little weak stuff, 
I'm going to have to (block) them." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson realizes that he can't muzzle Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"The more jive he talks, the better he's going to play," the coach said. 
"Coming out of high school, (talking) was all he did. But by the time he gets 
to be a senior, I think he'll have it toned down." 
</P>
<P>
But Miller doesn't plan to tone down his act for the nation's media at the 
Final Four. An aspiring sportscaster, he's already preparing new material for 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope I don't make a complete fool of myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller sometimes makes a fool of himself during games, playing to the 
Razorbacks' rabid fans. He is theatrical, pumping his fist to encourage fans to 
cheer louder and pointing to the scoreboard when Arkansas goes on a scoring 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Arkansas' most popular player, Miller has found that fame has a 
downside because he's continually being asked for his autograph. And it doesn't 
let up on the road, where fans knock on his hotel room door. 
</P>
<P>
What do his teammates think of all this? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it helps him, because it gets him in the flow of his game," Credit 
said. "I think it's to his benefit to talk on the court." 
</P>
<P>
After Arkansas defeated Texas to reach the Final Four, Miller staged a joyful 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
He grabbed the Razorback mascot and gave him a piggyback ride, before he raced 
over to cut down the nets. It wasn't an act. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was in high school, I dreamed of playing in the Final Four," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most heavily recruited high school basketball players in Texas after 
averaging 20 points and 15 rebounds a game while leading Southwest High School 
of Ft. Worth to the 1988 state title, Miller spurned offers from Texas colleges 
to play at Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think the schools in Texas got enough publicity and I wanted to go 
somewhere I could get some pub," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana Tech and Washington State, he 
signed with Arkansas because of Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a father figure to the players," Miller said. "If you're hungry, you 
can always go over to his house to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Miller never really knew his own father. After his parents divorced when he was 
a child, Miller was raised by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a mama's boy," Miller said. "I'm a mama's baby." 
</P>
<P>
A math teacher at Southwest High, Miller's mother coaches the girls' freshmen 
basketball team. She kept the scorebook at all of her son's high school games. 
Has she ever offered basketball advice? 
</P>
<P>
"If I say anything, he says, 'Just because you're the freshmen coach, you're 
going to try to tell me something,' " she said. "But you know how mothers are. 
I tell him anyway."

IT WAS A FULL DAY OF U.S. FOOTBALL IN BERLIN; 
</P>
<P>
GERMANY: AMERICANS LOSE IN WORLD CUP WARMUP. RAMS WILL PLAY CHIEFS IN AUGUST AT 
OLYMPIC STADIUM. 
</P>

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams and Chiefs are in town, some first lieutenant must have said. Do you 
want to go to a football game tonight? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the American GIs must have responded. 
</P>
<P>
So about 250 of them piled into buses at their Army base in West Berlin, 
crossed the border at Checkpoint Charlie along with seemingly everyone else in 
Europe these days, and soon found themselves at East Berlin's Jahn Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's not exactly the way it happened. But why else would that many 
red-blooded American soldiers go to watch the U.S. national soccer team play an 
exhibition game, unless somebody played a joke on them? 
</P>
<P>
In the lieutenant's defense, it was football, though he might have neglected to 
mention that it was the European kind. Although improving, Americans still do 
not play that exceptionally well, which they proved again Wednesday night in a 
3-2 loss to East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Americans do much better in their national pastime, promotion, which is why the 
Rams and Chiefs were on the affluent side of the wall Wednesday afternoon for a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Ram owner Georgia Frontiere and her quarterback, Jim Everett, were at the plush 
Intercontinental Hotel along with the Chiefs' owner, Lamar Hunt, and president, 
Carl Peterson, and their star running back, Christian Okoye, to announce an 
exhibition game between the two teams on Aug. 11 at West Berlin's Olympic 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 West German television, radio and newspaper reporters were there to 
see the NFL play the game the way no other league can. They were given free 
Rams and Chiefs caps, free Rams and Chiefs felt pens and a free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
They also were shown a highlight film entitled, "The Most Popular Sport in the 
United States -- American Football," and given a 48-page brochure called, "From 
First Down to Touchdown -- the Official Beginner's Guide to Football." 
</P>
<P>
The brochure, unfortunately, was in English, as were the remarks from all of 
the speakers except Peterson, who read a statement in German. He borrowed 
shamelessly from John F. Kennedy, saying, "Ich bin ein Berliner -- I am a 
Berliner," and compared the two Berlins to Kansas City. "One city, two states," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The best Frontiere could do was reveal that one of her grandmothers was German. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sing German, but I don't speak it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Frontiere said that West Berlin was chosen as the site of an exhibition game, 
in part, because it is a sister city to Los Angeles. But she doesn't need a 
reason to travel. The Rams also have played in London and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
American football seems to be spreading all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Two leagues, the International League of American Football (I-Laugh) and the 
World League of American Football (We-Laugh) were supposed to kick off this 
spring. But they decided to wait until 1991 because soccer's World Cup will be 
played this summer in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't delayed Tex Schramm, president of the NFL-sponsored WLAF, from 
making his appointed rounds to promote the sport. 
</P>
<P>
In Rome Tuesday, he said: "Quality and spectacle are going to sell it. We're 
going to try to make it an American spectacle, with the cheerleaders, the bands 
and all the festivities connected with American football. 
</P>
<P>
"American football has ingredients Italians like. It's physical. It's fast. It 
has artistry. It's combative. And it's macho." 
</P>
<P>
What it doesn't have, which soccer does, is continuous action. Admitting that 
European fans might become bored with the numerous interruptions, Schramm said 
the WLAF might institute a no-huddle rule. 
</P>
<P>
Which will catch on faster, Hunt was asked Wednesday, American football in 
Europe or European football in America? 
</P>
<P>
He is an expert on the subject, having lost a 10-gallon hat full of money as 
one of the North American Soccer League's original owners with the Dallas 
Tornado. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've both got an educational process to do," Hunt said. "Certainly, 
soccer is catching on in the United States with the children, but it has some 
particular problems at the professional level. 
</P>
<P>
"I think American football can be helped here by television. It fits into 
television very well. The problem with soccer in the United States is the lack 
of American players and the lack of an American team being a real positive 
factor there. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way: I don't expect the United States to beat East Germany tonight 
or get past the first round of the World Cup. But at least, they're there for 
the first time in 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
While Frontiere went to the opera Wednesday night, Hunt went to the soccer 
game. 
</P>
<P>
There were only about 4,000 other people in the 25,000-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
As one East German journalist said, East Berlin is hardly the country's soccer 
capital. Even if it were, it would be difficult to sell a game involving the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"For Brazil, it would sell out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was not Brazil Wednesday night. It was not even East Germany. 
But its play did surprise everyone here, including Hunt, the East Germans and 
maybe even the U.S. players. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany is not a great team, but it came within one game, a 3-0 loss to 
Austria in Vienna, of qualifying for the World Cup from a difficult region. 
</P>
<P>
But even after falling behind, 2-0, the United States kept attacking. Forward 
Peter Vermes scored on a left-footed kick from five yards in the 41st minute, 
and, after Kristen scored his third goal, forward Bruce Murray scored on a free 
kick from 28 yards in the 86th minute. 
</P>
<P>
It was a new approach for the U.S. players, who, after last week's 2-0 loss in 
Budapest to Hungary, seemed finally to have heard Coach Bob Gansler's message 
that they can't score goals if they play only defense for 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We revved it up a little bit," Gansler said. "We're still not good enough, but 
what I saw tonight, I liked." 
</P>
<P>
East German Coach Eduard Geyer said the United States is on a par with one of 
its first-round World Cup opponents, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. players reacted as if they had won. They were particularly pleased 
that they didn't back down against the East Germans. Anticipating rough play, 
the Americans wore spikes that were designed to sting when an opponent's shin 
got in the way. 
</P>
<P>
"That was so we could give as good as we got," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Which, when you think of it, is the way to play either kind of football.

MORNING BRIEFING: MAKING JOKES ABOUT CLIPPERS IS NO LONGER A MAN'S GAME

<P>
After the Stanford women's basketball team routed Arkansas, 114-87, in the NCAA 
West Regional, Arkansas Coach John Sutherland told USA Today that the Cardinal 
was the team to beat in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland: "I can't imagine Stanford having a hard time with anyone, except 
Los Angeles -- the Lakers, not the Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
Devil you say: If Duke fails to go all the way in the Final Four, it won't be 
for lack of confidence. At least, that's the way Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun 
talks.

Said Calhoun, recalling the Duke-UCLA game: "Once UCLA took the lead in the 
second half, I turned to one of my assistants and said Duke is going to win. 
You could see it in their faces. They expected to win. It's part of the way 
they think."

<P>
For what it's worth: Indiana Coach Bob Knight has won three NCAA basketball 
championships, but before this year's opening-round game against California, 
the only championship ring he was wearing was from the 1978-79 NIT.

<P>
Trivia time: Forward Tom Chambers of the Phoenix Suns last week became the 14th 
player to score 60 or more points in the NBA. How many can you name? 
</P>
<P>
High math: Mark Eaton, 7-foot-4 center of the Utah Jazz, has come up with a new 
answer to people who ask him his height in airports. He gives it to them in 
centimeters.

<P>
In case you're wondering, it's 223.41840.

Street talk: In the magazine Philly Sport, Wilt Chamberlain says of Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar: "No heart. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why he never played in the streets anywhere. He never played in the 
Rucker tournament." 
</P>
<P>
New entry: The race for MVP honors in the NBA appears to be wide open, with 
Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley and Karl Malone 
all in the chase, but Warrior Coach Don Nelson already is voting for a 
newcomer, San Antonio center David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson: "I think David is the best player in the league. It's clear-cut for me. 
He should be MVP and rookie of the year. I can only compare David to a guy I 
used to play with, Bill Russell. But Robinson is quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling assassin: Warrior rookie Tim Hardaway told the Oakland Tribune that 
Jordan is the best player he has faced but that Johnson is the player he'd 
least like to face night after night. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough," Hardaway said of Magic. "He knows the game inside and out. He 
doesn't rush. He picks you apart -- with a smile." 
</P>
<P>
Sky's the limit: ABC-TV's Arthur Ashe, on rising tennis star Jennifer Capriati, 
who turns 14 this week: "She can't miss, and I only said that about John 
McEnroe and Steffi Graf. She has the ability to wind up on the top level that 
only Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova and Graf have occupied." 
</P>
<P>
Add Capriati: At the Virginia Slims of Florida in Boca Raton, she spotted Wilt 
Chamberlain in the parking lot. According to the St. Petersburg Times, she 
reportedly said, "Dr. J?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Wilt Chamberlain 100, David Thompson 73, Elgin Baylor 71, 
Michael Jordan 69, Pete Maravich 68, Rick Barry 64, Joe Fulks 63, George Gervin 
63, Jerry West 63, George Mikan 62, Karl Malone 61, Bernard King 61, Larry Bird 
60, Tom Chambers 60. (Note: Only three players have had multiple games of 60 or 
more points. Chamberlain did it 32 times; Jordan, who had 69 Wednesday, four 
times and Baylor three.)

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last NBA Finals was a sweep. So was the World Series. The Super Bowl wasn't 
even that close. But look for something different and exciting Monday. Only one 
of the past eight NCAA basketball championship games -- Georgetown's 84-75 
victory over Houston in 1984 -- has been decided by more than four points. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The game drawing the highest TV rating in the history of the tournament remains 
Michigan State and Magic Johnson over Indiana State and Larry Bird, 75-64, in 
1979. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Can Nevada Las Vegas play as well again as it did Sunday against Loyola 
Marymount? Maybe not, but the Runnin' Rebels shouldn't have to equal that 
performance to eliminate talented but limited Georgia Tech in the semifinals 
Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Duke, which has matched up extremely well inside against Connecticut and UCLA, 
won't have quite the same advantage against Arkansas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How nice to have a Final Four inside an arena instead of beneath a dome. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best matchup: UNLV defender Stacey Augmon versus Georgia Tech bomber Dennis 
Scott. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing's legacy to college basketball is the T-shirt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And whoever thought sneakers would become one of the raging controversies in 
sports? . . . Nobody was more responsible for Central L.A. sending so many 
ballplayers to the major leagues than Chet Brewer, founder of the Chet Brewer 
All-Stars semi-pro team, who died this week at 83. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most ludicrous statistic in baseball is that Tony Gwynn is the 
seventh-highest-paid San Diego Padre. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Unless there are some hot pennant races yet to be decided, the makeup games the 
first week of October are going to be real snorers. Doubleheaders spread 
throughout the season would have been more interesting, but fewer dates would 
have meant refunds and less profit for the owners. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That boycott of exhibition games by major league umpires sure is bringing 
baseball to its knees. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Dodger Alejandro (Slow) Pena pitched a couple of innings for the Mets 
against the Yankees on TV the other night but obviously wasn't in form. Not 
nearly enough time between pitches. . . .

<P>
Latest sport to hit the silver screen is volleyball. "Side Out" -- starring 
Peter Horton and C. Thomas Howell and featuring volleyball stars Sinjin Smith, 
Steve Timmons and Tim Hovland -- will have its premiere tonight in Honolulu. .

<P>
Boxing has had its share of long counts, but not nearly as many as pro 
wrestling. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I can't believe that Guy Lafleur is still playing in the NHL -- if Quebec is 
still considered the NHL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Quarterbacks Ty Detmer of Brigham Young, Todd Marinovich of USC and Paul Justin 
of Arizona State will pose together in L.A. today for the photo that will adorn 
the western edition cover of the Sporting News' preseason football magazine. .

</P>
<P>
Junior Seau would fit very nicely into the Chicago Bears' defense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It figured that a Madison Square Garden team would win a division title this 
year, but the surprise is that it's the Rangers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers' Roger Neilson is to hockey what the Phoenix Suns' Cotton 
Fitzsimmons is to basketball -- a retread coach who actually is good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Portland defeats Atlanta tonight, the Trail Blazers will join the Lakers and 
Utah as the only NBA teams to have beaten every other team at least once this 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Joe Theismann and Channel 9 sportscaster Joe Fowler. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There are more talented players than Steve Kerr in the NBA, but few with more 
enthusiasm than the Cleveland Cavalier guard, who leads the league in 
three-point shooting percentage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Steve Lewis, gold medalist in the 400 meters at Seoul, and California's 
Atlee Mahorn, who finished fifth in the 200 for Canada, could hook up on the 
anchor leg of the 1,600-meter relay that culminates the Bruin-Bear dual meet 
Saturday at Drake Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You're not alone if you missed the NIT championship game Wednesday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michael Nunn's split with Ten Goose is hardly unique in boxing. Among other 
champions who have split from their managers, trainers or advisers are Mike 
Tyson, Larry Holmes, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, Joe Frazier and Donald 
Curry. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, Michael is second to none in lack of gratitude. The Goossen family put 
an enormous amount of hours and dollars into building him into a professional 
champion after he failed to make the 1984 U.S. Olympic team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I saw the future of the Lakers and Kings Tuesday night -- no Magic, no Gretkzy 
-- and didn't like it for two quarters and two periods until the Kings came to 
life against Winnipeg.

SMITH BEGINS BATTLE WITH AGENTS AT USC; 
</P>
<P>
TROJANS: COACH BARS REPRESENTATIVES FROM PRACTICE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LIMIT THEIR 
OPPORTUNITIES TO LURE PLAYERS TO ENTER NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when USC's Larry Smith was concerned only with coaching his 
football team. Now he has to be concerned with keeping it intact. 
</P>
<P>
With the NFL's new policy of allowing juniors to be drafted, Smith and other 
coaches have to look to the future -- and he doesn't necessarily like what he 
sees. 
</P>
<P>
Can he count on quarterback Todd Marinovich, a redshirt freshman last season, 
remaining at USC for three more years? Or, for that matter, any other player 
who emerges as a pro prospect? 
</P>
<P>
"If Marinovich has a great year next year, he'll be approached very strongly 
about coming out," Smith said. "Not by the NFL, but by agents." 
</P>
<P>
So far the NFL, fearing lawsuits by college players, has opened its door only 
to juniors. However, if a sophomore or even a freshman decides to make himself 
available for the draft, it's believed that the NFL can't prevent his applying. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus of college juniors into the draft this year -- 28 and counting -- is 
not an isolated circumstance, according to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"There is another pending threat (to colleges)," Smith said. "The draft pool 
for next year has been basically shrunk. Where are the extra 30 or 40 players 
going to come from? I think they'll come from the juniors and sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
"There is also another major factor that may be significant in a year or two. 
Who is going to stop the two new spring leagues from recruiting sophomores and 
freshmen for a year or two? 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL has already acknowledged that they'll be used as minor leagues. Nobody 
is panicking, but we have to get our head out of the sand. The NCAA and 
American Football Coaches Assn. must come up with some sort of legislation to 
make sure it isn't an open-floodgate type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
So what can colleges do to keep their players from becoming pros prematurely? 
</P>
<P>
"I think one thing you can do is make the letter of intent a four-year binding 
scholarship for both parties," Smith said. "Right now the letter of intent and 
scholarship is only renewable once every year through five years." 
</P>
<P>
Such an arrangement, Smith said, would be a contract, presumably preventing an 
undergraduate from turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
With spring practice ending Friday, Smith has things on his mind other than 
finding replacements for linebacker Junior Seau and strong safety Mark Carrier, 
who plan to go through the NFL draft next month as juniors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a workshop this spring for our whole football team," Smith 
said. "It will be sponsored by the athletic department concerning professional 
football, agents, contracts, salary structures and the whole bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I know now that a lot of decisions (by players) are being made out of 
indecision and fear," he said. "I know I have to tighten controls on who 
watches my practices, who is on our campus and who is talking to my players. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been an open-door policy before, but not anymore. The door is being 
controlled." 
</P>
<P>
Smith already has limited the days that NFL scouts can evaluate his players 
with expired eligibility and has literally shut the practice field door to 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
"The first Wednesday of the workout for the pros about five agents came to the 
gate and I threw them out," Smith said. "The next Wednesday a couple showed up 
again and I said, 'If you want me to, I'll escort you off campus.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he has no quarrel with NFL personnel, but he has declared his own 
war, of sorts, on agents. 
</P>
<P>
The USC coach said it bothers him that a player, such as Seau, is leaving 
before he can get his degree, or at least work substantially toward it. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe in a college education, even though a lot of people say I'm 
just blowing smoke," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Carrier, who would have been a five-year player, is only two or 
three classes short of getting his degree. 
</P>
<P>
"But I feel badly about Junior Seau," he said. "Physically, he may be ready 
(for the NFL), but I question whether he's ready mentally, and I question the 
fact that he is leaving school a year early while working toward a degree. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are two big negatives. The other negative is that he was sold a bad bill 
of goods." 
</P>
<P>
Smith contends that agents tend to paint pictures of money and conditions that 
aren't necessarily accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"Agents are playing both ends against the middle -- the NFL and us," he said. 
"And they're not being taken to task for any of this." 
</P>
<P>
In a curious development, Smith said that he may become an agent in deed, if 
not name. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an NCAA rule that says coaches can't act as agents for the players, 
and I think it's a good rule," Smith said. "But what they're forcing us to do 
is to be an agent of some sort when the players are sophomores and juniors to 
make sure they're getting the right information." 
</P>
<P>
A possible NFL salary cap on rookies has been cited as the main reason so many 
underclassmen declared for the draft this year. 
</P>
<P>
Smith discounts that suggestion, saying, "My sources say that's another year or 
two away. It's a ploy by agents to try to scare kids into signing." 
</P>
<P>
So Smith is conceiving other game plans nowadays, not for UCLA or Notre Dame, 
but for agents, who are perceived as raiding his team. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defensive lineman Don Gibson had surgery to repair a broken left ankle that he 
suffered Saturday in a game-type scrimmage at the Coliseum. . . . Coach Larry 
Smith said that free safety Lamont Hollinquest, who was expected to contend for 
a starting position, has been suspended from the team because of academic 
deficiencies.

RICHARDSON WINS THEM OVER AT ARKANSAS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MEMORIES OF RACIAL SLIGHTS AND FAMILY HEARTBREAK LINGER FOR 
SOUTHWEST CONFERENCE PIONEER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first black basketball coach in the Southwest Conference, Arkansas' Nolan 
Richardson, was heavily criticized after the Razorbacks struggled in his first 
two seasons, failing to qualify for the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Fans and alumni wrote hate mail, and some in the media said Richardson should 
be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"They barbecued me," Richardson said. "They thought I was supposed to be like 
Moses and come in here and deliver a winner overnight. It just didn't work that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said some criticism was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"You (could) see the underlying racism," Richardson said. "Let's face it, it's 
here. I don't think I've ever read such brutal (newspaper) articles. I even 
used to be graded out in the paper. I'd get a 'D' for recruiting and an 'F' for 
bench coaching. It was ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing. You can be at an all-white school with black players, and as 
long as you win, you never hear racial things. You only hear racial things when 
you're losing." 
</P>
<P>
While Richardson fought to build a good team, his daughter, Yvonne, fought for 
her life. The day before Richardson left the University of Tulsa for Arkansas 
in 1985, Yvonne's condition was diagnosed as leukemia. His wife, Rose, remained 
in Tulsa, where Yvonne received medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson admitted that he couldn't devote his full energies to coaching and 
recruiting because of his daughter's illness. He said he considered quitting, 
but his daughter talked him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget when I told her that I don't want to coach anymore, she told 
me that tough people last and rough times won't," Richardson said. "She told me 
it was just a matter of me getting some players that I could coach, and she 
guaranteed me that the fans would love me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, after Yvonne died at 15, Richardson devoted his life to rebuilding the 
Arkansas basketball program. He signed two high school All-Americans, guard Lee 
Mayberry and forward Todd Day. 
</P>
<P>
With the influx of talent, Arkansas has won two consecutive conference 
championships, compiling a 55-11 record. When the Razorbacks defeated Texas in 
the Midwest Regional final to reach the Final Four for the first time since 
1978, Richardson dedicated the victory to his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a young girl that I wish was here," Richardson said. "My first 
thought when the game was over, was, 'Yvonne, we got one for you, baby, and 
we're going to get some more.' She's the reason I'm still coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not she's alive, she's here in spirit with me. I know she's at 
God's hand smiling and saying, 'I told you, Dad, that if you just do what you 
say you're going to do, you'll be there one day.' " 
</P>
<P>
And the Razorback fans -- even those who tried to run Richardson off -- are 
begging him to stay. Everyone in the state claims to be on a first-name basis 
with Nolan Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
Does he feel vindicated? 
</P>
<P>
"I can forgive some of the things that happened and the things that were said 
about me, but I'll never forget," Richardson said. "I'm glad for all the people 
that were Nolan Richardson standbys. 
</P>
<P>
"(My enemies) are going to be angry anyway, so I don't have to worry about that 
group. They tried to barbecue me, but they just ran out of sauce. Hopefully, 
next year they won't get a gallon of sauce again and get ready for me. But I 
can expect that, because coaches are only as good as their last win. I 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' success has helped Richardson become a hot property. Colorado 
reportedly is interested in hiring him. However, there are reports that 
Arkansas will offer Richardson a $1-million annuity in an effort to retain him. 
Richardson, who turned down an offer from Ohio State last summer, is expected 
to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who grew up poor in El Paso, never dreamed that he'd be financially 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Texas El Paso, where he played football, basketball and 
baseball, Richardson signed with the San Diego Chargers as a defensive back in 
1963. After an Achilles' tendon injury cut short his career, he became a 
basketball coach at Bowie High in El Paso, where he compiled a 190-80 record in 
10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He left Bowie for Western Texas Junior College, where he had a 101-13 record in 
three years, winning the National Junior College title in his final season. 
</P>
<P>
He left for Tulsa in 1981, rebuilding the Hurricane into a national power. 
Tulsa won the National Invitation Tournament championship in his first season 
and qualified for the NCAA playoffs in three of his five years. 
</P>
<P>
He would have been content to remain at Tulsa, but he left for Arkansas because 
he wanted to blaze a trail for other black coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"In the East, (Georgetown Coach) John Thompson had a lot to do with helping 
black coaches, but in the South it wasn't happening for black coaches," 
Richardson said. "That was one of my main goals. I wanted to do some of the 
things that Jackie Robinson has done. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's one of my callings." 
</P>

Bear Mountain's big expansion plans appear to be on track again after a public 
meeting Tuesday night at Big Bear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went very well," said Tim Cohee, vice president of the ski area 
formerly known as Goldmine. "We're optimistic that details will be worked out 
with the city and the U.S. Forest Service, so that we can begin work in July or 
August." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, officials of S-K-I, which also owns Killington in Vermont, 
expressed frustration at the slow progress in obtaining approval for the eight- 
to 10-year development program at their recently acquired resort in the San 
Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But Cohee said Wednesday that $4 million worth of improvements are planned for 
this summer, including construction of a major quad chairlift and the addition 
of 20 acres of ski terrain. 
</P>
<P>
The lift, Bear Mountain's 11th, will boost the uphill capacity from 6,100 
skiers an hour to about 7,000, and the skiable acreage will increase to about 
165. When completed, the plan calls for 18 lifts with a capacity of 9,600 
skiers, serving 314 acres, plus expanded snow-making and base facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Cohee said that Bear Mountain will wind up this season on either April 8 or 15 
with about a 4% decrease in skier-days from last season. 
</P>
<P>
"That indicates we made a significant recovery after a slow start," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only three other Southland ski areas are still operating, with snow depths 
ranging from eight to 24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain High, near Wrightwood, will close Sunday night, but Snow Valley, near 
Running Springs, and Snow Summit, at Big Bear, hope to run their lifts at least 
through Easter Sunday, April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Valley, where Slide Peak is still open, will play host to its first Easter 
Carnival Saturday, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Money raised will benefit the 
California Special Olympic Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Summit, whose skier-turnout total will wind up "close to last year's," 
according to Carrie Shirreffs, communications director, plans to stage its 
annual Springfest April 9-14. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Cramer, manager of Mountain High, said he was happy with the way this 
season turned out, adding, "We'll finish with about the same numbers as last 
year, 345,000 skier-days." 
</P>
<P>
Mountain High, which recently told the U.S. Forest Service it has abandoned 
plans to connect its East and West mountains because of the prohibitive cost of 
the required environmental impact studies, will concentrate this summer on 
building an eight-mile pipeline from a new water source in the Mojave Desert, 
to increase its snow-making capability. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mark Ward of Ski Sunrise, Mountain High's neighbor in the San 
Gabriel Mountains, said: "We had a pretty good year, despite missing most of 
the Christmas holidays. We finally closed last weekend after having spring 
skiing at 9 a.m., summer skiing at 10 a.m. and water skiing at 11 a.m.

GRUNHARD IS TRYING HIS BEST TO CATCH ON; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: AFTER A HOME RUN TUESDAY, HE MAKES THREE FINE DEFENSIVE PLAYS IN LOSS 
TO PADRES.

Dan Grunhard may be the lowest-paid graduate of the Class of '87 from 
Northwestern University's College of Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern, which produces engineers and doctors by the score, is known for 
the strength of its academic programs and the failings of its football teams. 
While it occasionally turns out an NFL or NBA player, the Evanston, Ill., 
school is hardly an athletic factory. 
</P>
<P>
"The baseball program was really starting to pick up when I chose to go there," 
Grunhard said. "The football team? Well, I wouldn't say too much about that." 
</P>
<P>
Grunhard, a 26-year-old outfielder who was invited to the Angels' camp as a 
non-roster player, speaks well for the improvement of Northwestern's baseball 
program. The former premed student made three fine catches in left field 
Wednesday and threw out the fleet-footed Bip Roberts in the third inning when 
Roberts tried to stretch a single into a double. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't duplicate his home run of Tuesday, Grunhard again won praise 
from Manager Doug Rader after the Angels' 10-7 loss to the San Diego Padres at 
Desert Sun Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"He was terrific," Rader said. "That's one thing about the kids -- (Ruben) 
Amaro, Grunhard, (Reed) Peters. They're very much a compliment to our 
developmental people and they should be inspirational to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (Grunhard) plays defensively is very admirable, but the thing I like 
best is he never received a scholarship for anything. Everything he's gotten in 
this organization he's earned. Some players have silver spoons in their mouths. 
Dan Grunhard has been eating with his fingers. It's great to see." 
</P>
<P>
Grunhard, who hit .286 and .304 the last two seasons at double-A Midland, Tex., 
did get a partial scholarship at Northwestern. Among his teammates at various 
times were John Trautwein of the Boston Red Sox, Grady Hall of the Chicago 
White Sox, Marty Clary of the Atlanta Braves, Joe Girardi of the Chicago Cubs 
and Mike Huff of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to play professional baseball since I was a little boy," 
Grunhard said. "Going into college as a premed biology major, I always found 
that athletics was a great outlet during my college career to get away from the 
books. You have to set your schedule and budget your time very carefully. 
Especially at a school like Northwestern, where there's such demands 
academically." 
</P>
<P>
The demands of playing the outfield were multiplied Wednesday by the 
unpredictable wind and bright sun. Grunhard, who took Chili Davis' spot in left 
field after Davis developed tightness in his groin, had prepared well. 
</P>
<P>
"Checking the conditions today, I knew that on anything hit into the air in 
left field, especially a pop-up, I had to make sure I came in, because the ball 
would tend to tail away," said Grunhard, who fought the sun to make a diving 
catch on Roberts for the game's first out and followed that with a running 
catch on Roberto Alomar. "I had to really adjust and keep track of how hard the 
wind was blowing and where the sun was at all times. You can't afford to sit 
back on your heels when you're out there on a day like this." 
</P>
<P>
After throwing Roberts out in the third inning, Grunhard capped his day with a 
fine sliding catch in the sixth. "Bip's one of the fastest runners in the 
National League," Grunhard said. "As soon as the ball was hit, knowing who was 
at the plate, I assumed he'd be trying to go to second, so I came up and threw 
to the second-base bag. That's the only way to play it. If you hesitate, the 
play isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Grunhard went hitless in three at-bats but he was content with earning plaudits 
for his defensive work, because getting attention is difficult enough in this 
lockout-shortened spring. 
</P>
<P>
"That's universal for most players invited to camp, but it's mainly younger 
players who have less time to get noticed and do the things they're capable 
of," he said. "But I don't feel there's any type of pressure for me to do well. 
I just want to go out and play the way I can." 
</P>
<P>
Grunhard hasn't set a timetable for making the major leagues, but he knows that 
his biology degree is good security if his baseball career doesn't blossom. 
</P>
<P>
"I always figure I can go back to . . . well, I won't call it the real world," 
Grunhard said. "When I stop having fun playing, that will be the day I hang up 
my glove and spikes. Right now, I'm having a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven, who was the starter and loser Wednesday, was satisfied with his 
three innings' work and said he could have stayed in the game if necessary. The 
38-year-old right-hander allowed two runs and five hits, walked two and struck 
out two. He also gave up a wind-aided home run to Fred Lynn in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very strong. I had a little trouble with location on my fastball away 
on left-handers, but that's from being too strong and feeling too good," 
Blyleven said. "I went down to the bullpen and threw afterwards, and everything 
was OK. It's just a matter of getting some innings under my belt." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven didn't fare quite as well in his only at-bat. Wearing bright green 
wristbands, he missed with two exaggerated swings and then pointed his bat 
toward the center-field fence a la Babe Ruth in the 1932 World Series. He was 
out on the next pitch, fouling it off into the catcher's mitt. Then Blyleven 
walked away from the plate feigning disappointment, throwing his helmet in the 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' scheduled season-opening series at Seattle, which was wiped out by 
the lockout, will be made up in three visits to the Kingdome -- on May 3, May 
10 and July 11. That leaves the team with a single day off between April 24 and 
May 30. . . . During that stretch, the Angels will visit Boston, New York, 
Baltimore and Seattle, come home for six games, return to Seattle, and then 
return home for three more against Boston. After a respite on May 14, they will 
play the next 16 days, beginning with a trip to Milwaukee, Toronto and 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The three-game series at Oakland that was to have been played April 6-8, will 
be made up on Oct. 1-3. The times for those games have not been determined. 
Bert Blyleven, the Angels' player representative, said the players were unhappy 
about having to play a game on July 11 -- the day after the All-Star game -- 
because that's traditionally an off-day. However, he said there apparently were 
no alternatives. "If it has to be, it has to be," Blyleven said. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White led off Wednesday's exhibition with a first-pitch home run. . . . 
Donnie Hill, who sparked the Angels' six-run rally in the ninth with a two-run 
homer, represented the potential tying run when he came up again but struck out 
to end the game. . . . Mike Smithson gave up five runs in two innings, 
including two home runs. Doug Rader said the 15- to 20- m.p.h. wind made it 
impossible to judge his pitchers' effectiveness. "Wrigley Field was never like 
this," he said.

HAMSTRING SIDELINES SCHOFIELD FOR MINIMUM OF THREE WEEKS

Angel shortstop Dick Schofield, who reinjured his right hamstring Tuesday, went 
to Los Angeles Wednesday to be examined by team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum. The 
preliminary word is that Schofield could be out a minimum of three weeks, but 
Manager Doug Rader said that could change. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield said the injury "crept up on me," after he did the initial damage 
while running a week before spring training opened. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, Rader said Mark McLemore and Kent Anderson will share time at 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"McLemore has more speed, but the bottom line on Anderson is that he played a 
half-season for us at shortstop, and for a great number of those days we were 
in first place," Rader said. "That's very much in his favor. You have to weigh 
the athleticism of McLemore against what the kid has done for you on a 
pennant-contending club." HELENE ELLIOTT

The agreement to return major league umpires to exhibition baseball games fell 
apart Wednesday when the umpires and management could not agree on an 
arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Judge Stanley Greenberg was to consider the umpires' protest over 
the rescheduling of games without their input following the end of the spring 
training lockout. 
</P>
<P>
But management went to U.S. District Court Wednesday, asking Judge Norma 
Shapiro to disqualify Greenberg for undisclosed reasons. Judge Shapiro refused 
the request and when the two sides went back before Greenberg, he disqualified 
himself at management's request. 
</P>
<P>
That sent the two sides back before Shapiro, who tried to get them to agree to 
another arbitrator. Among the names suggested were former Commissioner Peter 
Ueberroth and former Vice President Walter Mondale, but the two sides could not 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
The umpires and baseball are due back in Shapiro's courtroom today, when 
management will pursue its request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the 
work stoppage.

SMALL FIRMS GET HEAD START WITH R&amp;D PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years ago, when San Diego entrepreneurs Sandra Hutchins and Jan Zimmerman 
sought to launch a software firm, a lack of funds threatened to deflate their 
start-up spirit. 
</P>
<P>
But that's when the duo stumbled across a research and development funding 
program sponsored by the federal government that makes grants available 
exclusively to small, American-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, when they founded Emerson &amp; Stern Associates, a publisher of 
speech and language development software, Hutchins, 44, and Zimmerman, 42, have 
received 19 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding awards -- a total 
of $3 million that has allowed their company to grow to the point that it now 
employs 20 at its Sorrento Valley plant. 
</P>
<P>
Although highly competitive, the SBIRs are fairly straightforward and painless 
-- a breath of fresh air, in essence, for those who have already jumped through 
bureaucratic hoops to garner federal R&amp;D funds through other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Administered by the Small Business Administration in Washington, the SBIR 
program has financed nearly all of the development costs of Emerson &amp; 
Stern's four commercial products, including a software program that helps the 
hearing-impaired develop speech skills and one that helps foreign students 
learn English. 
</P>
<P>
"None of these (products) would have happened without SBIR funds," said 
Hutchins, the company's president and chief technical officer. "For that 
matter, having SBIR funds was absolutely critical to the notion of us running 
an R&amp;D company." 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Toulson, an SBIR program manager based in Washington, said many other 
entrepreneurs and small business owners have duplicated Hutchins' and 
Zimmerman's success. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1988, the SBIR program awarded roughly 2,700 contracts -- worth more 
than $386 million -- to the nation's small businesses. California companies 
netted the lion's share, $98 million, of which nearly $16 million went to 
businesses based in the San Diego metropolitan area, SBA spokesman Michael 
Stamler said. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide total is up sharply from 1983, the program's first year, when 
about 700 grants totaling $50 million were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Its advocates say the SBIR program is more than just a handout to small 
business. At a time when many fear the United States is losing the 
technological race to Asian and European competitors, the SBIR program allows 
the government to foster innovative ideas from the nation's small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the government was not doing enough to tap the nation's pool of 
entrepreneurial talent, Congress passed the Small Business Innovation and 
Development Act of 1982, directing certain federal agencies that conduct 
R&amp;D to solicit innovative technology and products from small enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agencies with R&amp;D budgets equal to or greater than $100 million are 
required to set aside 1.25% of their research budgets for the SBIR fund. Only 
American-owned, for-profit businesses that employ 500 or fewer people are 
eligible to apply for SBIR funds, Toulson said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed for small businesses that have good ideas but can't 
compete with larger, better-known companies, Toulson said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the whole purpose of this program. We want to give the small business 
people a chance . . . to compete with the IBMs and the General Dynamics of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
The 11 participating agencies identify the R&amp;D work they want conducted out 
of house and express those needs to the SBA, which announces such requests in a 
quarterly publication available free to interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
The following agencies participate in the SBIR program: the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the 
National Science Foundation, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the 
Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and 
Human Services and Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a highly competitive, three-tier award system whereby small businesses 
can compete for government R&amp;D projects," Toulson said. "This is not a 
social program. It's not set aside for minorities. This is an open competition 
that awards contracts to the company that can deliver the best product." 
</P>
<P>
Applicants first compete for Phase I contracts. Participating agencies provide 
winners with up to $50,000 to conduct a feasibility study. If the study is 
accepted, the agency then awards the applicant a Phase II contract worth as 
much as $500,000 to develop a product or technology within two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The initial proposal can be no more than 25 pages," said Zimmerman, who is 
Emerson &amp; Stern's chief executive officer. "By the time you do budgets, 
references and a cover page, you're probably down to a 15-page proposal. And 
they give you an outline. . . . How much easier can it get? 
</P>
<P>
"Phase II proposals typically range from 65 to 200 pages," Zimmerman added. 
"It's definitely more work, but, then again, you're competing for 10 times the 
amount of money you get in Phase I." 
</P>
<P>
If applicants successfully complete the Phase II contract, the Small Business 
Administration helps them sell their new products or technology by providing 
entrepreneurs with information about potential customers or venture 
capitalists. However, Toulson said the SBA does not provide any financial 
assistance during this process. 
</P>
<P>
The government receives substantial benefits from the SBIR program, too, 
Toulson said. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, about 55% of all the (Department of Defense) outside R&amp;D work 
is done through SBIR," Toulson said. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman added: "They're getting innovative research and they're getting it 
far less expensively (than contracting with big companies that charge higher 
prices). And they tend to get (results) faster because small companies are 
often a bit more nimble." 
</P>
<P>
But there are some drawbacks to the SBIR program. 
</P>
<P>
It is a highly competitive process with only a few winners. Of the 17,039 Phase 
I proposals received for fiscal 1988, only 2,013, or 12%, received contracts. 
Typically, only 40% of Phase I winners go on to receive Phase II contracts, 
Toulson said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1988 SBA survey of 353 Phase II award recipients, 23% of them 
had successfully sold a product or were on the verge of selling a product as a 
result of SBIR funds. 
</P>
<P>
And applicants say there is often considerable lag time -- as much as six to 
nine months -- between completing a Phase I feasibility study and waiting for 
Phase II approval and funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as you get going on a project you have to set it aside and wait," 
Hutchins said. "The funding gap is hard to juggle. You get the right people to 
do the project, and then what do you do with them for six months? 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we'll move people around to another assignment, but sometimes we 
have to let (prospective) employees know that their job is tied to the funding 
that we get," Hutchins said. "That can make recruiting a difficult task." 
</P>
<P>
Emerson &amp; Stern Associates was founded in 1983 to escape the corporate 
bureaucracy that often slows the idea-to-product process. Hutchins previously 
held communications engineering posts at TRW and ITT, while Zimmerman was a San 
Diego-based media consultant to a variety of high-technology clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of beating our heads against the wall, we decided to do it ourselves," 
Hutchins said. "We thought we could do much better." 
</P>
<P>
Among the company's four commercial products is ESL Writer, an educational 
software program that checks spelling and grammar for students whose native 
language is not English. ESL Writer is distributed by Scholastic Software, a 
division of Scholastic Inc., a major New York-based educational publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The company also developed SAY &amp; SEE, a software program that analyzes 
dysfunctional speech sounds made, for example, by the hearing-impaired. By 
representing such sounds visually on a computer monitor -- the program 
re-creates images of the person's tongue movement -- the software enables a 
teacher to analyze faulty enunciation and to show the student how to correct 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been used primarily with deaf children," Hutchins said. "It's an 
opportunity for them to 'see' sound on the screen, and then the teacher can 
tell them what they're doing right or wrong. It gives them feedback that they 
can't possibly receive otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
SAY &amp; SEE is distributed by Interactive Learning Materials, a New 
York-based publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also developed rehabilitation software that helps people who 
have suffered head injuries regain reading, writing, reasoning and mathematical 
skills, and a word processor that allows an individual to write in American 
Sign Language. 
</P>
<P>
Companies interested in obtaining the SBIR quarterly publication or more 
information about the R&amp;D funding program should write to the Small 
Business Administration, Office of Innovation, Research and Technology, 1441 L 
St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20416, or call (202) 653-6458. Or contact the local 
SBA office, 880 Front St. 4-S-29, San Diego 92188. The quarterly publication is 
published in December, March, June and September.

3 CITE DISCRIMINATION IN SUIT AGAINST FUJITSU; 
</P>
<P>
LAYOFFS: TWO EXECUTIVES AND A SECRETARY CLAIM THEY LOST THEIR JOBS WITH THE 
COMPANY BECAUSE THEY AREN'T JAPANESE. THE TRIO SEEKS $70 MILLION IN DAMAGES.

<P>
Three former Fujitsu Systems of America employees have filed a 
wrongful-termination lawsuit against their former employer and its Japanese 
parent, alleging that they were discriminated against on the basis of race and 
national origin. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks up to $70 million in compensatory and punitive damages and was 
filed in San Diego County Superior Court by Frank Ensign, 59, the company's 
former chief financial officer; Terence Turnbull, 53, the former vice president 
of marketing, and Esther White 64, who was Ensign's executive secretary. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the plaintiffs are Caucasians who allege they lost their jobs for 
not being Japanese, their attorney Nicholas Boylan said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The trio were among 45 Fujitsu Systems employees who were laid off last April 
in what a company source described as a reorganization. The job cuts brought 
total Fujitsu Systems of America payroll down to 655 employees, 378 of whom 
work in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A subsidiary of Japan-based computer giant Fujitsu Ltd., with worldwide sales 
of $18 billion, Fujitsu Systems of America makes point-of-sale terminals, 
hand-held accounting systems and automated bank teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Boylan said the three were in fact subsequently replaced by Japanese 
employees of Fujitsu and thus were the victims of "pernicious and malicious 
race, age and national origin discrimination against plaintiffs by 
Japanese-owned . . . companies and Japanese individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Saying the company had not yet had a chance to review the suit, a Fujitsu 
Systems of America official who asked not to be named said the suit was without 
merit. 
</P>
<P>
Discrimination "would be hard for them to substantiate with the new 
reorganization and new job responsibilities," the official said. "I don't know 
how you compare one job with another." 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs allege in their suit that the reorganization was a "pretext" to 
achieve a goal of placing people of "Japanese race and/or national origin in 
key financial or management positions." 
</P>
<P>
Boylan said Ensign and Turnbull were both recruited by Fujitsu from other 
companies and that both were earning salaries in excess of $150,000 at the time 
of the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Each had spent five years or more with the company, during which time none had 
ever been given negative performance reviews by their employer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three has been able to find employment since the layoffs, Boylan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ensign, who was hired away from Aerojet by Fujitsu, has had to sell his home in 
Rancho Santa Fe as a result of losing his job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which asks up to $20 million in compensatory damages and up to $50 
million in punitive damages, also names Fujitsu America in San Jose and Fujitsu 
employees Takehiko Noda, Yusaku Onaga and Yasushi Nakamura as defendants.

REPORT FINDS WIDESPREAD BIAS AGAINST UNMARRIEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR F. ZONANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A report documenting widespread and often illegal discrimination against 
unmarried people in Los Angeles -- ranging from higher dues at health clubs to 
restrictions on visits to hospital bedsides -- will be released today by a 
consumer task force convened by City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
"Discrimination based on marital status is arbitrary, inappropriate, illegal 
and unfair -- but it is also a pervasive national problem," said Thomas F. 
Coleman, chairman of the Consumer Task Force on Marital Status Discrimination 
and an adjunct professor at the USC Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Our report represents the emergence of a new dimension of the consumer 
protection movement," he added. "Call it singles' rights." 
</P>
<P>
The unmarried -- those who are single, divorced, separated or widowed -- make 
up 55% of people of marrying age in the city, Coleman said. The U.S. Census 
Bureau defines "marrying age" as 15 years or older, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A sleeping giant is awakening, and once it awakens there are going to be major 
changes in the way businesses and others interact with unmarried consumers," 
Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, who called a press conference for this morning, declined to comment on 
the 126-page report, an advance copy of which was obtained by The Times. But in 
creating the task force last October, the city attorney said: "Most of us 
aren't living in traditional American families anymore, and the rights and 
privileges extended to a few should be extended to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The report details numerous instances of alleged discriminatory practices in a 
wide range of situations. Among them: landlords who refuse to rent to single 
people or unmarried couples; auto insurers who levy higher premiums or will not 
write policies for singles; credit unions that will not issue joint loans to 
members and their fiances; and airlines that restrict the use of frequent-flyer 
awards to spouses or blood relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these practices are illegal in California," said Coleman, an expert on 
family law. In many areas, such as housing, singles and unmarried couples are 
already covered by fair-housing laws and regulations, the report noted. Where 
specific statutes are lacking, the report urged more vigorous enforcement of 
existing laws barring arbitrary discrimination or unfair business practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Most consumer protection programs focus almost exclusively on consumer fraud 
and virtually ignore the issue of discrimination," the report charges. 
</P>
<P>
Other remedies the report recommends include increased efforts to educate 
consumers, voluntary cooperation by businesses and, where ambiguities exist, 
clearer laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"There are signs of change," the report notes. For example, the Greater Los 
Angeles Zoo Assn. recently liberalized its membership policy to provide 
admission to any two adults, regardless of marital status; previously, 
admission was for the member and "spouse." 
</P>
<P>
In cases where bias is not deliberate but stems from unintentional assumptions 
or inappropriate terminology, a simple letter to the offending business can 
bring redress, the report said. Last November, for example, Wells Fargo Bank 
apologized to the task force for using the word "spouse" in a promotional offer 
to credit-card holders. 
</P>
<P>
"To have been more accurate, the offer should have been made to 'the joint 
account customer,' " Eric Kahn, a bank vice president, wrote to the task force. 
"We are grateful for your bringing our misworded letter to our attention." 
</P>
<P>
Some businesses cite economic reasons to justify charging higher prices for 
single people. For example, in response to new state regulations barring the 
use of marital status in setting auto insurance rates, State Farm and Allstate 
recently filed suit against the state charging that marital status, among other 
factors, "bears a substantial relationship to the risk of loss." 
</P>
<P>
Like other California-based social movements, the drive to secure equal rights 
for unmarried consumers is being noticed in other parts of the country. "This 
is a question that begs examination, and Los Angeles has taken a very positive 
first step," said Virginia M. Apuzzo, deputy executive director of the New York 
State Consumer Protection Board. 
</P>
<P>
Apuzzo said her agency plans to mount a similar campaign against marital-status 
discrimination, adding: "People are not being treated equally in the 
marketplace. It isn't fair." Apuzzo, who has worked on behalf of gay rights, 
said economic discrimination based on marital status is of special significance 
to gay people, who are denied the right to wed, though the majority of persons 
who are victimized are heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles task force held three public hearings and heard testimony from 
about 30 witnesses, including business representatives, legal experts and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The task force did not specifically address "domestic partnership" legislation, 
which was considered by an earlier city task force. After that earlier report, 
the Los Angeles City Council redefined the term "immediate family" to offer 
sick leave and bereavement leave to city employees with unmarried partners. 
Other municipalities, including West Hollywood and Berkeley, have gone even 
further, granting health benefits to domestic partners of city workers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the testimony to the consumer task force came from individuals who 
alleged discriminatory practices by landlords, insurers, banks, credit unions, 
nursing homes, hospitals, health clubs and frequent-flyer programs. 
</P>
<P>
Valeria Morea, the fiancee of a member of TWA's frequent-flyer program, told 
the panel that she was denied permission to board a plane with her fiance, even 
though he had qualified for an award of two tickets. The airline cited its 
policy of permitting only spouses or immediate family members to use the second 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
TWA has since changed its policy, the task force report noted. 
</P>
<P>
Some other airlines, however, still have restrictions that the carriers say are 
designed to prevent sale of the frequent-flyer awards to strangers, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Matthews, an account executive with the advertising firm McCann-Erickson 
in Los Angeles, has lived with advertising copywriter Adam Shreve for nearly 
four years and has been waging a running battle with the Mid Valley Athletic 
Club in Reseda to obtain the joint membership discount the club offers to 
married couples. 
</P>
<P>
As singles, Matthews and Shreve each pay $55 a month for membership, or a total 
of $110 a month. Were they married, they would be entitled to a joint 
membership for $65 a month -- just $32.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should a single person, or a widowed person, or a person who is new to 
town, pay nearly twice as much for the same membership?" Matthews asked. 
</P>
<P>
"As a single person, I take up one-half the room in the aerobics class, dirty 
one-half as many towels, consume one-half as much shampoo, and flush one-half 
as many toilets as a two-person married couple," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We considered forging a marriage certificate on Adam's Macintosh," Matthews 
continued. "But then we decided that the system was wrong and that we should 
fight it." 
</P>
<P>
So far, it has been a losing battle. Despite two meetings with club general 
manager Harold Wright, a flurry of letters, and public testimony by Matthews 
before the task force, the club refuses to budge. 
</P>
<P>
"You are either married or you're not," Wright said in an interview. "It would 
be an administrative nightmare to provide joint memberships to unmarried 
couples," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a moral issue for us," Wright added. "We're not trying to impose a 
value system on our members." 
</P>
<P>
But societal privilege for married people is very much a moral issue to Beverly 
Sheldon, whose husband, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, heads the Traditional Values 
Coalition in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Single people aren't providing the same stability to our country, they're not 
providing offspring, they carry more diseases," said Mrs. Sheldon, director of 
research for the fundamentalist Christian organization. 
</P>
<P>
Though she said she opposes discrimination, she added: "I feel saddened that 
(singles) want to take away the help (society grants married couples) simply 
because they can't have it, too." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Coleman accused Sheldon of "vile stereotyping that lumps all 
unmarried people into one negative category, whether they are widows, gays, 
divorcees or even members of the clergy." 
</P>
<P>
"California has a strong public policy to protect the freedom of choice of 
individuals to marry, or not to marry," he added. "The state's policy of 
granting certain privileges to married people does not imply a corresponding 
policy to discriminate against the unmarried." 
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Task Force on Marital Status Discrimination was convened by Hahn 
after the city's advisory Task Force on Family Diversity recommended that the 
city attorney crack down on discrimination against unmarried individuals and 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer panel did not investigate workplace discrimination against 
unmarried people because the city attorney lacks jurisdiction in employment 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the panel included attorneys, consumer protection officials, human 
rights advocates and representatives from such businesses as Pacific Bell and 
Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members said that perhaps the most compelling testimony was provided by 
Juan Navarrette, who explained how a nursing home barred him from visiting his 
unmarried partner, Leroy Tranten, after Tranten fell from a ladder and suffered 
brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two had lived together for eight years, Navarrette said he was 
kept away from Tranten at the insistence of a hostile relative. "I visited him 
for 10 months in the hospital, but after they transferred him to the nursing 
home, they wouldn't let me see him," Navarrette said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to bring him ice cream. I wanted to bring him food, but they wouldn't 
let me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Navarrette went to court to challenge the forced six-week separation, he 
was too late. Five days before the scheduled hearing, Tranten died and, without 
notification to Navarrette, the body was flown out of state. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't even let me pay my last respects," he said.

CYANIDE ISSUE CLOUDS JUNEAU'S VISIONS OF GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JUNEAU, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 2 miles south of downtown, on the western flank of snow-capped Mt. 
Roberts, looms the hulking, rusted frame of the abandoned A-J Mine. 
</P>
<P>
Its rich lode of gold gave birth 100 years ago to this small city in a setting 
of misty fiords, icy peaks and almost constant rain. 
</P>
<P>
Now Juneau is turning to the mine again. Facing a decline in oil revenues, city 
officials and Echo Bay Exploration Inc. of Canada plan to turn the A-J into the 
largest underground gold mine in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
The mine would operate nonstop seven days a week and use tons of cyanide each 
day to leach the gold from crushed ore, a technique that has transformed 
previously unprofitable mines into bonanzas. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a technique that environmentalists say could pollute the region's 
air and drinking water and endanger salmon fisheries in nearby Gastineau 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they can control pollution from cyanide, but will they? They said 
they could control an oil spill at Valdez, but did they?" said George Rogers, 
73, a retired economist and Juneau resident of 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Echo Bay officials say the project would generate 450 jobs, a $20-million 
annual payroll and 300,000 ounces of gold each year for the 13-year life of the 
mine. The City of Juneau would earn 3.5% royalties from the gold produced and 
gain an estimated 600 jobs indirectly related to the mining. 
</P>
<P>
In full swing, the project would amount to 7% of the local economy, said Eric 
McDowell, economic forecaster for Juneau. That could come in handy for a 
capital city of 30,000 people that is filled with white-collar government 
workers dependent on the state's dwindling oil income. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, developed by Echo Bay, calls for milled ore to be soaked in vats 
containing a weak cyanide solution that dissolves gold. After the gold is 
extracted, residual cyanide would be chemically neutralized. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 100 million tons of tailings containing toxic heavy metals would be 
dumped each year into nearby Sheep Creek Valley. A 345-foot dam would be built 
at the head of the valley to create a reservoir, so the wastes would be under 
25 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
"Sacrificing Sheep Creek Valley for the short-term jobs and payroll this mine 
would bring isn't worth the risk to the environment and health and safety of 
local residents," said Skip Gray, 40, a cable television producer and leader of 
Alaskans for Juneau, a group opposed to the mine. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say they will battle the proposal through several steps. The company 
must obtain permits from a host of local, state and federal agencies, including 
Juneau's Planning and Zoning Commission, but city officials appear committed to 
reopening the mine by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Mine supporters say it is not a question of losing a chunk of wilderness, it is 
a question of saving their city. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as using a valley, not losing one," said Don Abel, 53, a lifelong 
resident of Juneau and owner of a building supply company. "If oil revenues go 
down, this town will go down with them." 
</P>
<P>
Alaska's other two large cities, Fairbanks and Anchorage, have diversified 
economies based on mining, defense, transportation, government and fishing as 
well as oil, but they also suffered when oil prices fell about five years ago, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many of the old mines scattered among the granite peaks of the 
100-mile-long Juneau gold belt are being reevaluated for the first time in 45 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Precious-metals exploration in Alaska tripled between 1987 and 1988. Last year, 
Juneau saw one of the nation's largest silver mines swing into operation 15 
miles away on Admiralty Island. The Greens Creek mine, expected to yield 6.4 
million ounces of silver and 36,000 ounces of gold, has created 200 jobs for 
miners who are ferried to the site on catamarans operated by local 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden return of precious-metals mining in these parts has caught wildlife 
biologists and state conservationists unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little worried about it because we just don't have the manpower," said a 
water quality expert with the State Department of Environmental Conservation in 
Juneau. "But we are going to have to set up some kind of monitoring program if 
we are going to rely on data other than mining company information." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Nevada Chapter of the Sierra Club last year requested a federal 
investigation into allegations that ponds containing cyanide at Echo Bay's 
McCoy-Cove mine, about 150 miles northeast of Reno, Nev., caused the death of 
700 birds and other wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out there was a problem at a reservoir intended to reclaim cyanide 
solution," said Frank Bergstrom, Echo Bay's Manager of Environmental 
Compliance. "Within two months, a water treatment system was designed and 
installed to address the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of growing concerns about environmental hazards, Echo Bay has moved 
aggressively to produce television advertisements and sponsor studies that 
could allay such fears. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Echo Bay hired aquatic biologist Jim Buell to conduct an $85,000 
study to determine whether heavy metals in the concentrations expected from the 
A-J Mine would affect the survival rate of salmon fry in a nearby hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
Peering over a 5,000-gallon vat containing 80,000 inch-long fish at the Douglas 
Island Pink and Chum hatchery, Buell said: "We really put it (heavy metals) to 
them right around hatching time -- exposed them for 15 days. Then we nailed 
them again for another 15." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are going to put them in seawater and see what happens," Buell said. 
"If it can be demonstrated that a mine and hatchery can co-exist, then a lot of 
peoples' notions might stand some correcting."

Bergstrom said that so far, fish exposed to the heavy metals seemed to be 
"perky little guys." 
</P>
<P>
A federal biologist familiar with the study, however, questioned the value of 
the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"So the fish don't go belly up in four nanoseconds. What's that prove?" Nevin 
Holmberg of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asked. "You need to look at the 
impact of discharge of heavy metals into an ecosystem over a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "The issue is not whether a slug of heavy metals in a tank results in 
deaths. I'm equally concerned about the effects of these heavy metals 
throughout the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the controversy are what some opponents call "possible 
conflicts of interest" that have arisen since the mining company came to town. 
</P>
<P>
The City and Borough of Juneau and a local utility, for example, own the site 
of the mine and stand to earn substantial royalties from the gold it produces. 
</P>
<P>
And Echo Bay is paying $100,000 annually to the only newspaper in town, the 
Juneau Empire, to rent the top floor of the paper's building as its local 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Jensen, 82, wonders what all the fuss is about. Jensen was 19 when he 
rode freight cars and ocean-going barges to find a $7-a-day job shoveling ore 
into subterranean box cars at the A-J. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone would have raised these concerns back then, they'd a shipped 'em out 
on a barge the same day, so help me God!" said Jensen, who lives in a house he 
built and has decorated with bear and wolf trophies he has taken over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Ferguson Craig, a graphics artist who came to Alaska in 1969 to work as 
a placer miner, sees it a different way. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in favor of reopening the A-J mine until I hiked up to Sheep Creek 
Valley last summer," Craig said. "I saw a beautiful cottonwood forest in the 
gorge, and I saw my responsibility. We don't have a right to bury a valley in 
toxic waste."

A-BOMB TRIGGERS FOR IRAQ SEIZED IN LONDON; 
</P>
<P>
NUCLEAR WEAPONS: A U.S.-BRITISH STING OPERATION INTERCEPTS 40 DEVICES BEING 
SMUGGLED FROM CALIFORNIA.

U.S. and British agents in London seized 40 Iraq-bound nuclear bomb triggers 
that had been smuggled out of Southern California, officials said Wednesday. 
Six people, including two Iraqi nationals, were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The raid on a cargo hangar at Heathrow Airport climaxed an extraordinary 
international sting operation that began in San Diego 18 months ago, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a sting all the way," said one State Department source. 
</P>
<P>
"We've stopped some very serious business from going forward," said U.S. 
Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hallett nor other American or British officials would discuss the 
operation in any detail. It was not clear if the triggers were sought by the 
Iraqi government or if that nation has developed nuclear weapons capability. 
Nor did officials explain what had prompted the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, President Bush said in a statement that the arrests 
underscored his "deep concern about the issue of nuclear proliferation in the 
Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
The President added: "We again call upon nuclear suppliers to exercise special 
restraint in providing materials related to the development of nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons and intermediate-range missiles in the volatile 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, we urge all states in the area to adhere to the non-proliferation 
treaty. Iraq is a signatory of that treaty. Iraqi officials are well aware of 
our views on nuclear proliferation, which we have made clear on several 
occasions." 
</P>
<P>
A sealed indictment in the case has been returned in federal court in San Diego 
and may be unsealed today, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
According to an NBC News report, CSI Technologies Inc. of San Marcos, near San 
Diego, alerted officials to an attempt by two Iraqis to buy the sophisticated 
electronic devices used to trigger nuclear weapons. CSI executives could not be 
reached Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A second U.S. firm, EG&amp;G of Wellesley, Mass., said late Wednesday that it, 
too, had been cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
EG&amp;G's president, Donald M. Kerr, said in a statement that the firm had 
provided customs agents with more than 40 inoperable trigger devices, known as 
krytrons, apparently for use as decoys in the sting. 
</P>
<P>
EG&amp;G, which has a sales office in San Diego, is the only domestic 
manufacturer of the devices, which are strictly controlled by the U.S. 
government. Such devices generally are acquired at advanced stages in the 
production of nuclear weapons, nuclear experts said. 
</P>
<P>
EG&amp;G is a major contractor for the Department of Energy, which is 
responsible for producing nuclear weapons for the nation's arsenal. EG&amp;G 
also runs the department's Nevada Test Site and its facilities at Rocky Flats 
in Colorado, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls and the 
Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that a crate containing the EG&amp;G trigger devices was shipped 
to London earlier this month aboard a TWA plane out of Los Angeles 
International Airport. At Heathrow, the crate was stored at a TWA cargo depot 
for several days. Authorities moved in as the container was about to be loaded 
onto an Iraqi Airways flight bound for Baghdad, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Britain's Customs and Excise Department named three of those 
arrested as Ali Daghir, 49, a company director with dual Iraqi and British 
nationality; Lebanese engineer Toufic Fouad Amyuni, 37; and export executive 
Jeanine Celestine Speckman, 41, a Frenchwoman married to a Briton. The other 
three people arrested were not identified either by British or U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
NBC News identified Daghir as the main suspect and said he allegedly posed in 
London as an importer of frozen french fries from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported from London that British authorities said they 
had also arrested Iraqi national Omar Latif, who was immediately served with a 
deportation order, and a Cypriot with a British passport who was released after 
questioning. The Home Office said Latif was being deported because of 
"attempted breaches of legislation governing the export of strategic goods from 
the United Kingdom." The Iraqi ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office 
and informed of the expulsion order. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear if Daghir or Latif had any ties to the Iraqi government. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deferring (on the release of any details) to the British government at 
their request, due to the extreme sensitivity to Iraq," said U.S. Customs 
spokesman Dennis Shimkoski. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the execution in Baghdad two weeks ago of Farzad Bazoft, a 
British-based journalist convicted of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
The President's concerns were echoed by experts in nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
"This just points out the shortcomings in the international system, which isn't 
going to catch them every time," said Deborah Holland, issues director for the 
Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based organization that studies 
terrorism and nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Milhollin, director of the Washington-based Wisconsin Project on Nuclear 
Arms Control, said the incident has significant implications. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing it means is that a country which has joined the 
non-proliferation treaty (Iraq) has violated it by trying to make the bomb," 
Milhollin said. "The device they were trying to import secretly obviously was 
intended to make a nuclear weapon. So they have been caught red-handed in 
violation of this treaty."

SMALL CITIES ARE LOSING AIRLINE SERVICE AS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES END. MANY FEEL 
LIKE REMOTE ISLANDS WHERE SHIPS NO LONGER COME TO CALL.

BLYTHE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once a month, Robert D. Briggs, warden of the Chuckawalla Valley State Prison, 
has to travel to Sacramento for a meeting of all of California's prison 
wardens. Until recently, he flew out of this sleepy desert farming community, 
made a connection in Los Angeles and completed the round trip in one day. 
</P>
<P>
But those days are gone -- apparently forever -- and Briggs has a much longer 
and more difficult trek. Now, to get to the state capital, he must drive four 
hours to Ontario to catch a flight. (He could also drive to Phoenix or Las 
Vegas to catch a plane, but those flights are longer and more expensive.) And 
the trip now involves a night away from home. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Briggs' predicament is that Blythe -- in southeastern California 
near the Arizona border -- is one of a number of small communities that have 
recently lost scheduled commercial air service because government subsidies 
have been ended. Since the beginning of the year, it has been impossible to fly 
to or from Blythe, a city in the center of a region where about 17,000 people 
live. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of communities like Blythe now must depend on their own cars or on 
bus or rail service, which have also been greatly reduced in recent years. And 
when a nationwide strike of Greyhound bus drivers began recently, the 
vulnerability and isolation of people who have no regularly scheduled air 
service became more evident and more serious. 
</P>
<P>
In some cities the cutbacks can have severe economic consequences, affecting 
big corporations and little businesses alike. Community leaders fear that 
elimination of flight service will stymie economic development and hurt civic 
pride. The effects of the loss of commercial aviation have been felt from 
Blythe to Elkhart, Ind.; Sidney, Neb.; Mansfield, Ohio, and New Bedford, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the inconvenience the cutbacks have caused for people who fly on 
business, they have also seriously affected private travel. For example, people 
here are unable to move quickly when family emergencies arise, and vacations 
are sometimes more awkward, with arrangements having to be made to leave cars 
parked at distant airports for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Blythe is like an island not being served by any ships," complained Floie 
Barrows, president of the Blythe Chamber of Commerce. "For the first time in 
several decades this area has been growing. My main concern is that new 
employers looking to locate here will hesitate to do so because you can't get 
people in and out of this valley by air." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of air service can be costly in other ways, too. The State of 
California must pay more than $4,000 a month in additional mileage and per diem 
costs incurred by the 6 to 10 prison officials who travel out of Blythe every 
month and for the like number who come here to visit the facility, Warden 
Briggs calculated. That's not counting the work-days lost as a result of the 
extra traveling. 
</P>
<P>
Blythe's twice-a-day flights were operated by a small, Los Angeles-based 
carrier named Air LA. 
</P>
<P>
But then Congress swung the budget ax, slashing funds that had subsidized 
airlines that were losing money in some cities they served. With the 
disappearance of the government handouts, the airlines stopped flying to many 
of those communities, including Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty airports serving 25 communities were affected by this first round of 
cuts, which totaled $6.6 million, from what is known as the Essential Air 
Service program. Some have already lost their service but city leaders in some 
of the communities are fighting to save it -- trying to persuade the airlines 
to continue the service even though the subsidies have ended. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidies have been controversial, with opponents maintaining that in the 
years since deregulation communities should have patronized their airlines 
enough to put them on a solid financial footing. They add that the airline 
subsidies have been much too high, compared to the $25 a passenger that the 
Amtrak railroad service receives. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most tellingly, they ask whether all Americans should be taxed to 
support airline service to small towns. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters argue that the communities helped by the subsidies have needed them 
to survive and grow. Providing such funds, they say, is "a normal function of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to say is that for some of these small rural communities 
this is the only means of public transportation," said Linda Daschle, vice 
president for federal affairs of the American Assn. of Airport Executives. 
"When Congress passed the deregulation act, no one said that we were going to 
totally eliminate air service to parts of our country. 
</P>
<P>
"While it is true that the per-passenger subsidy for Amtrak passengers is much 
less than those for EAS, you cannot compare the two. Amtrak serves large 
metropolitan areas where there is also a lot of competition from the large 
commercial airlines, and people have a choice of how they want to travel." 
</P>
<P>
In a few of the affected communities, residents don't care much whether their 
local airports are served by commercial airliners. An hour's drive to a large 
airport with many available flights is sometimes seen as beating the high fares 
and poor service they had been subjected to by the small and financially shaky 
airlines that were providing the subsidized service. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts that took place Jan. 1 are probably only the beginning. The U.S. 
Department of Transportation, which administers the Essential Air Service 
funds, has said that in the next fiscal year subsidies affecting air service to 
other localities will be whittled. The 1991 EAS funding of $24 million 
represents another $6 million reduction from the 1990 level. 
</P>
<P>
When airline deregulation went into effect in 1978, there were 350 communities 
getting subsidized airline service, with about half of them in Alaska. Since 
then, many communities have generated enough traffic so that the airlines 
serving them no longer require such financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Jan. 1 cuts, 130 communities are still being subsidized -- 90 in the 
48 lower states and 40 in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Alaskan subsidies will continue because air service is the only 
practical means of transportation in some areas. But most of the 90 communities 
in the lower 48 are trying hard to fend off the threat to their airline 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is "slicing us as if we are salami," said Raymond J. Rasenberger, a 
Washington, D.C., lawyer who represents a group of about 50 of the cities. 
"They are going to continue this approach until there is nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
John V. Coleman, director of the Transportation Department's Office of Aviation 
Analysis, hints that the end of the program is in sight, with the exception of 
the Alaskan subsidies. "It could become worse in the future. In this fiscal 
year and for subsequent years (we will) pare back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be too traumatic to discontinue the program in its entirety right 
now," he added. "But we have an obligation to do an evaluation and to make some 
cuts. The cost of continuing to subsidize air service . . . exceeds the 
benefit. . . . There is a strong case for weeding down." 
</P>
<P>
But the trend has been strongly criticized within the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
"As 1990 dawns, 20 more small towns are cut to meet even more tight-fisted 
standards," said a newsletter published by Avmark, an aviation marketing and 
management service in Arlington, Va. "Billions are spent to subsidize so-called 
mass transit in big cities, a half billion for Amtrak, and almost 
three-quarters of a billion for America's moribund merchant marine. How about a 
program to restore decent air service to America's heartland?" 
</P>
<P>
The loss of air service has had drastic consequences in some communities. 
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen who depend on tourists and other visitors feel the pinch 
within days after the flights end. Small establishments -- from gas stations 
and cab drivers to restaurants and motels -- suffer most. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of its air service hit Elkhart, Ind., particularly hard. 
</P>
<P>
The city, the nation's recreational vehicle manufacturing capital, was served 
until January by Iowa Airlines, a small commuter carrier. But when its 
subsidies for Elkhart were eliminated, the carrier discontinued the flights, 
saying that not enough passengers took the only route available: from Elkhart 
to Chicago's Midway Airport. 
</P>
<P>
According to Robert L. Kelso, president of the city's chamber of commerce, 
individuals flew here to buy vehicles and professional drivers came to pick 
them up for sale by distributors elsewhere. Once able to fly to Elkhart, they 
now must fly to South Bend, 22 miles away, and drive to Elkhart. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Kelso said, they don't buy fuel in Elkhart anymore, and they don't 
spend much there on lodging or meals. If they stay overnight, it's in South 
Bend hotels. Already, one motel has filed for bankruptcy, according to James G. 
Cobb, manager of Elkhart's airport, and other businesses are in danger of 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
New Bedford and Fall River, two Massachusetts cities only a few miles apart, 
are also victims of the cutbacks. Fall River hasn't had air service for some 
years, but New Bedford's airport served both communities until the subsidy was 
ended in January. 
</P>
<P>
A great deal of New York City's garment industry's goods are made in the New 
Bedford-Fall River area. "The high-fashion designers come up here from New 
York," said Mark Montigny, president of the Fall River Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry. "So do buyers and sellers of firms and their corporate executives. 
Just as many (local people) go down to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"We're close enough to Boston and Providence that they can drive here from 
there, so we are not dying from it. But we cannot say anymore that we're 10 
minutes from the nearest air service." 
</P>
<P>
Montigny said the lack of air service has also badly hurt the more than 200 
apparel factory outlets in the Fall River-New Bedford area. 
</P>
<P>
People used to fly to New Bedford for shopping sprees, he said, at the 
beginning of their vacations. "Tens of millions of dollars were spent between 
Fall River and New Bedford. Now, with the loss of airline service, we have lost 
one big market we used to exploit." 
</P>
<P>
The Essential Air Service program was created as part of the legislation that 
deregulated the airlines. Deregulation allowed airlines to fly wherever money 
could be made. Carriers dropped unprofitable routes and moved their planes to 
more lucrative markets. 
</P>
<P>
The EAS was designed to ensure that smaller communities would continue to get 
at least minimal air service, even though without the subsidies it would be a 
money-loser for the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
When the recent spending reductions were imposed by Congress, the Department of 
Transportation came up with criteria for loss of subsidies in the first round 
of cuts. One was the degree of isolation that would be caused to a community by 
loss of air service, with communities near other airports the first to be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the subsidy was also considered, for the airlines had been 
subsidized for the losses they incurred on a route on a per-passenger basis. 
The difference between expenses and revenues on a route equaled the amount of 
the subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
If the subsidy was more than $200 a passenger, the route was considered to have 
too few passengers to make it worth flying. So if an airline was losing so much 
that it required a subsidy that big, the payments were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Some communities lost their service because almost no one used it. The 
Transportation Department reasoned that they thus would not suffer undue 
hardship. Columbus, Neb., for example, had an average of only 1.4 passenger 
boardings daily. In Winslow, Ariz., the number was 1.8 and in McAlester, Okla., 
it was 1.6. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of such communities, however, say that the reason there was such scant 
use of the subsidized flights was that the fares were high and the service bad. 
</P>
<P>
For some communities, the lack of air service threatens efforts to attract new 
industry, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidy to serve Huron, S.D., is being continued only on a month-to-month 
basis while the community tries to find a new airline to take over the service 
from Masaba Airlines, which is losing money and plans to get out. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Bisch, president of the Greater Huron Development Corp., said the community 
recently lured a new industry from St. Paul, Minn. -- the Trussbilt Co., a 
division of Lanier Industries. "The move was dependent on a number of things," 
Bisch maintained. "Without air transportation, this community would not have 
been in contention. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to work with the federal government," he said. "Otherwise 
these (small) communities are going to dry up, and the big cities are going to 
get bigger, and the cost of operations for everything is going to be higher 
than it is out here." 
</P>
<P>
And there are other communities that lost their subsidies where service 
continues temporarily at least. 
</P>
<P>
Salem, Ore., for example, is served by Horizon Airlines, which until Jan. 1 
received a subsidy of $37 a passenger to break even. In hopes of becoming 
self-sufficient, the airline will continue service a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
When you want to lure big firms to your community, "one of the questions they 
ask is: 'Can you fly there?' " said John Elegant, superintendent of the Salem 
Municipal Airport. "They want to fly to San Francisco and change planes to 
Salem. If the only way to get here is by chartering a plane, people don't 
consider that air service." 
</P>
<P>
But community pride often enters the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Battle Creek, Mich., was one of the cities that formally lost its air service 
subsidies Jan. 1. But it had not held the carrier that served it, Air 
Wisconsin, to its required two trips a day for some time before that. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no incentive for anyone in our community to use it," said Lugene 
Demarest, manager of the Battle Creek airport, which still serves general 
aviation. "They did not give us good service and good fares. . . . We had to 
have something usable, or what was the use of keeping it?" 
</P>
<P>
Demarest conceded that having no air service "hurts community pride." She says 
this is especially so because Kalamazoo, Mich. is only 22 miles away and Battle 
Creek residents now have to use that airport. "Any time you have two cities so 
close together, there is a good deal of rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
But through the generosity of its neighbor, Battle Creek can continue to hold 
its head high. The Kalamazoo Airport has been renamed the Kalamazoo-Battle 
Creek International Airport. 
</P>

BROWN OPENS BID TO MANDATE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR WORKERS

Assembly Speaker Willie Brown acknowledged Wednesday that he faces long odds in 
the fight to require all California employers to provide health benefits to 
their workers. But he had some advice for anyone who doubts that he can do it: 
</P>
<P>
"Never, never, never bet against me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Brown began his effort to coax and cajole about half a dozen 
bitterly divided special-interest groups into a consensus on the best way to 
provide medical coverage to the more than 5 million Californians who are 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
Brown (D-San Francisco) said he will introduce as his own a proposal drafted by 
two top appointees of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian but disowned by the 
governor. Then, Brown said, Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) will bang 
heads in public and in private for several months until a plan emerges that the 
business community can accept and the governor will sign. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Margolin, at a Capitol news conference, said they were not embracing 
the administration proposal, which was drawn up by Deukmejian's top appointees 
on health and business issues. But the two lawmakers said the proposal provides 
a foundation they can build upon. 
</P>
<P>
"It deserves to be the starting point for our legislative debate," Margolin 
said. "It's a debate that has to occur this year, and hopefully be completed 
this year. The impact on the state of California of allowing this problem to 
continue is just too dramatic and too devastating to ignore any longer." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is how best to provide broadly based health insurance. While the 
elderly have the federal Medicare program and the very poor are covered by the 
state Medi-Cal plan, an estimated 4 million workers and dependents have no 
coverage through their jobs and cannot afford to buy insurance on their own. 
Others not covered by insurance include retired people not yet qualified for 
Medicare and the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal developed by the administration would require every California 
employer to offer a minimum package of health insurance benefits to every 
employee. Employers would have to pay at least 75% of premiums for their 
workers and 50% for their employees' families. 
</P>
<P>
The state would subsidize the costs for low-wage employees and low-profit 
businesses, in part by allowing them to obtain insurance through the Medi-Cal 
program, which now is limited to the poor. The authors of the $2-billion plan 
said it could be funded without new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian refused to endorse the plan earlier this month because it was not 
the product of a consensus among employers, labor, doctors, insurers and 
consumer groups. He also said he would reject any proposal that placed too 
heavy a burden on small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Margolin said his first priority will be addressing the concerns 
of small-business owners. But he called on business representatives to end the 
"posturing" he said he witnessed during the meetings of an administration task 
force that studied the issue earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough to say what you don't like," Margolin said. "We're going to 
ask people to say what they do like and put forth their own proposals." 
</P>
<P>
Martyn Hopper, director of the California office of the National Federation of 
Independent Businesses, said his membership might accept a mandate if insurance 
premiums could be brought to between $40 and $60 per employee a month. But he 
said that could not be achieved without reforms of the legal system and medical 
cost-containment that he fears will be defeated by powerful lobbies 
representing doctors and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that, after all the negotiations, the only thing that is going 
to be left intact is the mandate," Hopper said in an interview. "The 
small-business owner is going to be left holding the bag."

BALLOT TITLE: CANDIDATE IN 3 WORDS OR LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One candidate chose the term "peon." 
</P>
<P>
Another sought the ballot designation "wage slave," but was turned down. He 
finally accepted the more prosaic "worker" in its place. 
</P>
<P>
State election officials told a third candidate he could use "poker player" as 
his occupation, but not "gambler." 
</P>
<P>
Today is the deadline for deciding candidates' occupational designations that 
will appear under their names on the June primary ballot. The chief of the 
secretary of state's elections division, Caren Daniels-Meade, reports there 
have been more than 120 disputes over the designations, which should be no more 
than three words long. Some of the rifts have involved well-known candidates, 
others obscure ones. A few cases are in court; a few others remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no agreement between election officials and the candidate, and no 
court gives directions by tonight, the candidate will appear on the ballot with 
no designation under his or her name. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein is already resigned to that 
category. When the secretary of state's office turned down her preferred 
designation of "former mayor of San Francisco," on grounds it was "too long and 
the word 'former' cannot be used," she decided to run without designation. 
</P>
<P>
Ballot designations can be critical. Polls show that some candidates do far 
better with one designation than another, particularly in races where many 
voters are grasping for straws in making up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the most recent Los Angeles County judicial elections, the only 
judge who lost was Roberta Ralph, who made the mistake of picking the 
designation "incumbent," rather than Superior Court judge. Other candidates 
have benefited by designating themselves "disabled veteran" or in some other 
way that might elicit voter sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have held important elected offices, like Feinstein, usually wish to 
remind the electorate of it. Angela Buchanan, a Republican candidate for state 
treasurer, for instance, told the secretary of state's office she wanted to use 
"retired U.S. treasurer" as her designation, thus reminding voters of a 
position she held more than a decade ago. This was rejected as "not 
appropriate" and the matter is in court. 
</P>
<P>
One of the angriest ballot designation battles this year involves Walter 
Zelman, a Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner who wants to use 
"director, Common Cause" as his ballot designation, despite the fact that he 
resigned that position to run and no longer occupies it. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials accepted this under a policy that says if someone had a job 
just before announcing candidacy, that job can be used as the designation. But 
Common Cause's national president has denounced Zelman for using his former 
Common Cause title, and Common Cause's new state director is seeking a court 
order prohibiting its use. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels-Meade said the secretary of state's office had trouble with seven other 
insurance commissioner candidates' choices for ballot designation. Only one of 
those remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
Officials agreed, after documentation was submitted, to accept Democrat Michael 
Blanco's desire to be designated as "living trust attorney," and Democrat Ray 
Bourhis' desire to be designated as "insurance consumer's attorney." They 
reached an agreement with Democrat Bill Press to use "consumer advocacy, 
commentator," in place of the "consumer advocate, commentator" that he 
originally wanted to use. Peace and Freedom candidate Tom Condit was the one 
who settled for "worker" in place of "wage slave." Peace and Freedom candidate 
B. K. Duren's wish for "activist for democracy" was changed to "community 
development organizer" and Libertarian Ted Brown's choice of "insurance client 
representative" was altered to "insurance adjuster/investigator." 
</P>
<P>
But there has been no agreement over Republican Tom Skornia's desire to be 
designated "legal reform advocate." A court hearing is set on that today. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Secretary of State Anthony L. Miller explains that election laws 
state that the ballot designation is supposed to reflect the profession, 
vocation or occupation of the candidate, and not a statement of belief in a 
particular issue or the name of any political philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Merle Woo, a Peace and Freedom candidate for governor, was turned town 
when she wanted to use "socialist feminist educator" under her name on the 
ballot. She settled on "feminist studies educator." 
</P>
<P>
It often seems to be a fairly intricate matter of semantics, and the secretary 
of state's office frequently asks candidates to submit documentation or 
arguments that will persuade it to go along with a suggested designation. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the case of Roger Batchelder, the San Diego state Senate 
candidate who wanted to be known as a "peon," election officials were at first 
reluctant. But he pointed out that a dictionary definition of the term was "a 
member of the laboring class" and convinced them that for him "peon" was 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels-Meade said that recent heavy attention focused on the abortion issue 
led several candidates to try unsuccessfully for designations reflecting both 
sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Salomer Honigsfeld, a Peace and Freedom candidate for the 4th District Board of 
Equalization seat, for instance, tried to get "pro-choice nurse" past the 
authorities. But she settled for "retired nurse." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Jeffrey T. Greene, running for governor, wants to use "family values 
advocate and political organizer," a violation also of the three-word limit the 
state imposes. This one remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't take it if it implies an evaluation," Daniels-Meade explains. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is a very difficult law to administer," she said. "The candidates are 
getting more creative. We spent seven or eight extra hours last Saturday 
calling people at home and trying to work some of these things out." 
</P>
<P>
But some, Daniels-Meade said, could not be resolved. John Eastman, for 
instance, a Republican congressional candidate from West Covina, wanted to call 
himself a "presidential appointee." Told that this was not acceptable to 
election officials, he then proposed "Reagan-Bush official, businessman." That 
was not acceptable either and there is, as yet, no agreement.

NEWS AGENCIES JOCKEY FOR SPACE AT THE PRISON GATE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Tuesday's scheduled execution of Robert Alton Harris draws near, news 
organizations have begun quietly renting rooms, balconies and even lawns from 
residents living near San Quentin prison. 
</P>
<P>
The grim business -- and it indeed has become an enterprise, with one 
well-located balcony renting for $2,000 -- developed because of the difficult 
access to the prison's main entrance, where a large anti-death penalty 
demonstration is planned for the night of the 3 a.m. execution. 
</P>
<P>
Getting in and out of this tiny San Pablo Bay village near San Rafael is 
expected to be extremely difficult when the only road into town, a two-lane 
street, is jammed with what authorities expect will be a crowd of 3,000 
demonstrators and several hundred sheriff's deputies, police and California 
Highway Patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure they have the room needed to do their jobs -- and, in the case of 
one Bay Area television station, to broadcast a live one-hour special -- news 
agencies turned to people living in former prison staff housing just outside 
the gate. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and journalists, fearing such deals may seem to be in bad taste, are 
reluctant to discuss specifics. But many concede that significant money is 
being discussed: One man is asking $2,500 for his front lawn, while a woman at 
the low end of the scale has rented spaces in her home for $400 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a bidding war out there," said Al Corral, assistant news director at 
KTVU, an independent Oakland television station. 
</P>
<P>
John Motroni, managing editor at KGO, the local ABC television affiliate, said 
the renting of space is unavoidable because location will largely decide how 
well a significant aspect of the story -- the protest demonstrations -- can be 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like a game of Monopoly," Motroni said. "Everyone wants to land 
on Boardwalk and Park Place instead of Baltic Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
(The Los Angeles Times also is negotiating with local residents for the 
installation of telephone lines for use by its reporters.) 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from what it had originally said was standard procedure, the 
state Department of Corrections said Wednesday that Harris will continue to be 
allowed direct contact with visitors through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision will let the condemned man meet for one last time with members of 
his family on that day, about a day and a half before he is scheduled to die in 
the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, prison spokesman Cal White said that "security concerns" in the death 
penalty protocol required that Harris be separated from visitors by a pane of 
glass. Conversations would have been conducted over telephones. 
</P>
<P>
The Prison Law Office, a legal aid group for prisoners and their families, had 
threatened to sue over the loss of contact visits, said spokeswoman Laura 
Prado. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the complaints of a small band of residents who live next to the 
prison, the Marin County Board of Supervisors said there is little the county 
can do to ban anti-death penalty protests outside San Quentin prison's gate. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, who live along the two-lane road to the prison's main gate, had 
asked the county to try to block the execution by suing the state because it 
cannot guarantee that residents will be safe from demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents and supporters of the death penalty have said they will assemble 
outside the prison gate the night before Harris is scheduled to be executed. 
Residents fear that their lawns will be littered and their homes damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gary Giacomini, who represents the village of San Quentin, suggested 
the residents lobby Sacramento to find a new location for the gas chamber if it 
is used again. He said it is too late to relocate Harris' execution, which 
according to the death warrant must be carried out at San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's office Wednesday released the list of 16 news agencies 
that will be allowed to send representatives to witness Harris's execution. 
</P>
<P>
Among the organizations selected to attend are The Times and the two major wire 
services, the Associated Press and United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the list includes four media representatives -- two from daily 
newspapers, one each from radio and television -- from San Diego, where Harris 
committed the two 1978 murders that put him on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
The list also includes one television and one radio station each from Los 
Angeles and San Francisco, as well as a Sacramento television station. Also on 
the list are two newspapers from San Francisco, the largest city close to the 
prison; a newspaper from Sacramento and the local newspaper in Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the list is the Sacramento Bee, the largest, most influential 
newspaper in the state capital. Deukmejian spokesman Tom Beermann said the 
exclusion of the Bee was not related to its editorial opposition to the death 
penalty or other Deukmejian Administration programs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the number of news agencies seeking to witness the execution was far 
more than could be accommodated. The witness list was drawn up by the 
governor's staff with help from the Department of Corrections, Beermann said. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 36 other execution witnesses will be drawn from among state 
officials, prison staff, people designated by Harris and the family of his 
victims. The names of those witnesses will not be made public by the prison.

FEDERAL JUDGE TURNS DOWN LATEST APPEAL BY HARRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge here Wednesday turned down Robert Alton Harris' appeal of his 
death sentence, leaving the condemned killer with only the slimmest hope of 
avoiding execution next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William B. Enright, who twice before had denied Harris' 
pleas for mercy, turned him down again, saying there was no merit to a new 
appeal that his San Diego lawyers filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also sharply criticized Harris' attorneys for the tactics they took 
in filing the new appeal. And he said that the 11-year odyssey Harris' case has 
taken through the state and federal courts was an abuse of the legal process 
that had generated disrespect for the judicial system among a frustrated 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, this case, and all the tragedy it has brought to so many lives, 
has fully run its course," Enright said. "The decision by the jury 11 years ago 
should be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
"All things have a beginning," he said. "All things have an end. This matter 
should be concluded." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys appealed Enright's decision immediately after the hearing to 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the next-to-last step Harris has left. 
If the San Francisco-based appellate court also rejects Harris, his sole hope 
in the judicial system lies with the U.S. Supreme Court -- which has denied 
Harris' appeals four times, most recently on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, is in line to become the first person executed in California in 23 
years. He put his sole hope for a reprieve with the federal courts after last 
week withdrawing a request that Gov. George Deukmejian consider clemency -- 
that is, commute his death sentence to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
State courts repeatedly have denied his appeals. The California Supreme Court 
upheld Harris' death sentence in 1981. This past March 16, the court turned 
down a new appeal by Harris' San Diego attorneys, Charles Sevilla and Michael 
McCabe. 
</P>
<P>
The federal appeal, filed Monday, essentially relied on the same arguments that 
failed to persuade the state Supreme Court to spare Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys contend that new psychiatric evidence shows that Harris 
suffered from a variety of mental disorders that played a part in the killings. 
It would be unfair to execute Harris because those conditions were not 
considered when he was sentenced, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office maintained that claim was nothing more than 
an attempt by defense attorneys to put new labels on old evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Enright said Wednesday that he wondered why Sevilla and McCabe even tried the 
tactic. The papers the defense lawyers filed suggested that psychiatrists who 
examined Harris at the time of the trial did not do a good job and that his 
lawyer at the trial, San Diego attorney Tom Ryan, did him a disservice because 
he relied on the psychiatrists' reports. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge said the doctors and Ryan had done a fine job. It was "very 
difficult" to understand why the defense lawyers had chosen to "belittle the 
efforts and diminish the professional reputation of those who have labored in 
the same vineyard previously," Enright said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am fearful that this approach does substantial disservice to the 
profession," Enright said, referring to the practice of law. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla said after the hearing that he and McCabe were being professionally 
responsible and were simply trying a tactic that had proven successful in 
similar cases. 
</P>
<P>
Enright also made it clear he thought the appeal was without substance. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has "had his day in court as no other (prisoner)," Enright said. "No 
constitutional error has occurred, no miscarriage of justice has been had. 
(Harris) has had his rights fully and fairly preserved at every level of trial 
and review." 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication late Wednesday when the 9th Circuit will take up 
Harris' case. It is likely that any oral arguments in the case will be 
conducted by telephone conference, Sevilla said.

SANDINISTAS LEGALIZE PROPERTY SEIZURES; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: TITLES ARE AWARDED TO 10,000 LIVING IN STATE-OWNED HOUSES BEFORE THE 
ELECTION. ORTEGA AND OTHER OFFICIALS BENEFIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
A month after being voted out of office, the Sandinistas voted themselves into 
the former homes of their political enemies Wednesday, legalizing the 
occupation of about 10,000 residences seized during a decade of revolution. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 67 to 2, the Sandinista-dominated National Assembly awarded 
property titles to anyone who was living in a state-owned house before the Feb. 
25 election and had signed a public registry. 
</P>
<P>
Those benefiting from the law include defeated President Daniel Ortega, the 
eight other comandantes of the Sandinista National Directorate, hundreds of 
party officials and many ordinary Nicaraguans now renting from the state. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most controversial of several recent laws to benefit the Sandinistas 
before they turn over the government and the National Assembly to the National 
Opposition Union (UNO) of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on April 
25. 
</P>
<P>
After toppling President Anastasio Somoza in a 1979 guerrilla uprising, the 
Sandinistas nationalized all properties of his family and closest supporters. 
Other homes were confiscated under a 1981 law that made anyone absent from the 
country for six months subject to dispossession. Others were simply seized 
without legal justification. 
</P>
<P>
Many supporters of Chamorro owned homes now occupied by Sandinistas. They are 
demanding that the new Assembly overturn the law. But her closest aides, 
fearing the trouble that homeless Sandinistas could stir up, promised the 
government Tuesday as part of a broad transition agreement that no one will be 
evicted. 
</P>
<P>
Parties in Chamorro's UNO coalition did not take part in Wednesday's Assembly 
debate. The Marxist opposition Popular Action Movement raised the strongest 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Cuadra, the party's assemblyman, argued that mansions seized from Somoza 
and his supporters "are the patrimony of the Nicaraguan people" and should not 
revert to private hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who call themselves revolutionaries, the first thing they should do is 
abandon those luxurious houses," he declared. "I cannot conceive of a single 
revolutionary who would divide up real estate like war booty." 
</P>
<P>
To blunt such criticism, the Sandinistas coupled the bill with a less 
controversial one, giving property titles to about 70,000 other families who 
built their own homes on land seized by the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
"These laws do not favor only Sandinistas," said Julio Marenco, a Sandinista 
assemblyman. "We know that a great many people of UNO are also benefiting." 
</P>

Under amendments accepted by the Sandinistas, each beneficiary is limited to 
one house -- most of the comandantes have several -- and occupants of larger 
homes are required to pay.

<P>
The prices are a post-revolutionary bargain -- $5 per square meter for houses 
in the 100- to 200-square-meter range, and twice that rate for anything bigger. 
Cuadra estimated that a house worth $40,000 would go for $2,000.

Former owners will be compensated at the government's tax-assessed value, a 
small fraction of true worth.

A presidential spokesman declined to comment on whether Ortega and his wife,

banker who was out of the country at the time of the Sandinista takeover.

DOCTORS CONTEND HONECKER AND TOP AIDES ARE TOO ILL FOR TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
EAST GERMANY: THE FORMER HARD-LINE RULER IS CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION. HE HAS 
CANCER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ousted Communist leader Erich Honecker and his former key aides are too feeble 
to answer corruption charges and will likely never go to trial, prosecutors 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A team of "prominent, independent" doctors, including a psychiatrist, examined 
the cancer-stricken Honecker and his deputies, said Dieter Platt, spokesman for 
the state prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"The final decision is up to the court," Platt told The Times in a telephone 
interview, "but at this point, it (prosecution) doesn't look likely." 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the 10 former Politburo and parliamentary members under criminal 
charges are in jail, Platt said. The rest, including former Prime Minister 
Willi Stoph, are considered too sickly or senile. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, is recuperating in a village outside Berlin from surgery to 
remove a tumor. Doctors have advised that he be moved from the cramped garret 
room where a village pastor gave has given sanctuary, but angry citizens 
hounded him away from a more spacious government villa. 
</P>
<P>
"Feelings here are very complicated," Platt said. "For many reasons, not the 
least of which is German character, the people long for accountability." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of citizens have called or written the prosecutor, Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
On the streets of East Berlin, people expressed anger at the possibility of no 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied," said auto mechanic Andreas Kloebbe, 30. "It's not right. 
How come they're all suddenly at death's door? They weren't too old or too sick 
to commit the crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Werner Michael, 68, a Leipzig resident, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They had so many luxuries and lived so well, while all the time the majority 
of people were struggling for a decent life," he said. "Yes, there should be 
trials -- fair trials, though you could say we were all guilty. We're all 
part-victim and part-participants." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiments are common here these days. East Germans find themselves 
curiously frozen in history, unable to fully account for their Stalinist past 
or fully plan their democratic future. 
</P>
<P>
First steps toward forming a new government have proved shaky since the 
country's first free elections March 18. Rumors of secret-police collaboration 
have dogged newly elected Parliament members and stalled coalition talks, which 
are now scheduled to begin in earnest today between the Christian Democrats and 
the runner-up Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Grass-roots citizen groups have called for mass demonstrations today to demand 
that all 400 deputies in the new Volkskammer, or Parliament, be checked for any 
ties to the dismantled Stasi security police. The state prosecutor's office has 
said that such an investigation must be left to the Volkskammer itself, since 
deputies enjoy immunity. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the Stasis once numbered 85,000, with 109,000 informants. Files 
were kept on about 6 million of the country's 16 million citizens, whose 
everyday lives were often scrutinized for even the slightest hint of disloyalty 
to the hard-line regime. 
</P>
<P>
The former Stasi chief, Erich Mielke, is among the ex-Politburo members 
reportedly unfit for trial. The 82-year-old general, described as "a senile old 
man" by deputy prosecutor Lothar Reuter in the West German daily newspaper 
Sueddeutsche Zeitung, is accused of wrongfully imprisoning people and theft. 
The latter charge stems from the routine Stasi interception of mail, Platt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Treason charges were dropped earlier this week against Honecker and his aides, 
but they are still charged with misuse of power and corruption. The others 
include former Economics Minister Guenter Mittag, who remains imprisoned but is 
said to suffer from severe diabetes; former Parliament President Horst 
Sindermann, 74, who has heart disease, and former Central Committee secretary 
and Politburo member Hermann Axen, 74. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office declined to provide further details about their health 
problems, citing doctor-patient confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
No court dates have been set, but the official news agency ADN said a final 
decision about their fitness to stand trial is likely next month.

EAST GERMANS FIND 2ND MASS GRAVE OF WWII INTERNEES

<TEXT>
<P>
A man who says he saw Soviet troops shoot scores of interned Germans after 
World War II has helped to uncover their mass grave in a forest near Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
East German officials said Tuesday that Kurt Mueller, now 60, led them to the 
grave near the village of Schmachtenhagen that could contain as many as 400 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second mass grave exposed in recent days in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Mueller told us that no one wanted to know about it before but that now it was 
time to bring it all to light," local government official Heinz Erdmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings took place close to the infamous Nazi concentration camp of 
Sachsenhausen, which Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's troops turned into an 
internment camp for Germans they suspected of being Nazis in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Such disclosures would have been unthinkable under East Germany's former 
hard-line Communist leadership, installed by Stalin in 1945 and ousted last 
year in a peaceful revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller, an East German, told his story to the authorities about three weeks 
ago. Preliminary digging initially revealed nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"The 11th excavation turned up bones and skeletons," said Erdmann, deputy 
chairman of the Oranienburg regional government, which is responsible for 
Schmachtenhagen. "We don't know how many died. Mueller said it could have been 
100, 200, 300 or 400." 
</P>
<P>
More extensive excavations will be continued. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, East German media reported the existence of a mass grave near the 
northern town of Neubrandenburg containing layer upon layer of skeletons of 
people who died at a nearby Soviet internment camp.

BUSH DEFENDS CAUTIOUS LITHUANIA POLICY 
</P>

<P>
President Bush moved Wednesday to quell criticism of his muted response to the 
Soviet crackdown in Lithuania, facing off with restive Republican lawmakers in 
a pair of heated sessions at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a Winston Churchill, not a Stanley Baldwin," the second-ranking House 
Republican, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, reportedly snapped at one point, 
referring to Britain's forceful World War II prime minister and a wishy-washy 
predecessor who served in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said a "clearly annoyed" Bush strongly defended his policy of restraint 
and appeared to cool off much of the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
But the fourth-ranking House Republican leader, Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, 
said that although there is willingness on Capitol Hill to temper public 
complaints about the President, there is widespread sentiment there that Bush 
should speak out more forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the House is expected to approve a resolution as early as today 
that expresses strong support of the new Lithuanian government and seeks to 
nudge Bush toward establishing diplomatic relations with it. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed a similar resolution last week, but only after watering down 
a version by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) that slammed Bush for not reacting with 
enough enthusiasm to Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich unleashed his criticism at a meeting between Bush and Republican 
congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a very spirited exchange, and he won," Gingrich told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush persuaded him that any overt U.S. action -- such as formal 
recognition of Lithuania -- would trigger the immediate use of force against 
the new government by the Soviet military. He also noted that Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is under enormous pressure, including from the military, 
to use force in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't gain anything by forcing a confrontation," Gingrich declared, noting 
that he had been "educated" by the exchange with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At a subsequent meeting with two Republican and two Democratic congressmen who 
recently visited Lithuania, Bush encountered particularly strong pressure from 
Rep. John Miller (R-Wash.) to act more forcefully, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had pointed out to 
Gingrich that "we have a strong and consistent policy of urging dialogue" and 
that "we want a peaceful resolution." Bush wants to be careful that he does not 
inflame the situation, Fitzwater added.

A grand jury Wednesday refused to indict a copier repairman who shot a man to 
death after seeing the man gun down a woman in a shopping mall. The repairman 
said he was grateful and didn't consider himself a hero. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Alan Broom, 25, could have faced a murder charge for the March 12 shooting 
of Eddie Edwards, 41. Broom said he fired two shots at Edwards' car after 
watching him shoot Demetria Yvonne Taylor, a 28-year-old airline stewardess, in 
the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking of myself as a hero, and I don't know what a hero is supposed 
to be," said Broom, adding that he would "probably hesitate a lot more" if a 
similar circumstance arose. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Frank Jackson, said: "We feel that equity prevailed in this case, 
and sometimes you have to temper the law with equity in order to arrive at the 
just result." 
</P>
<P>
Broom, who was at the Irving Mall to buy bullets, has said that he saw Edwards 
chase Taylor across the lot and shoot her, then shoot her again in the back of 
the head as she lay mortally wounded. She and Edwards had recently ended a 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards was driving away, Broom said, when he got out of his car, drew his 
.44-caliber magnum pistol and fired twice at Edwards' car. 
</P>
<P>
One bullet hit the back of the car; the other went through a side door, 
striking Edwards in the side. Edwards lost control of the car and hit a pole. 
He died an hour later.

Hundreds of mourners, many weeping, others calling for revenge, offered their 
prayers at a funeral home Wednesday for 17 victims of the city's deadliest fire 
in 79 years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, meanwhile, began preparations for a grim airlift of the dead to 
their Honduran homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross has asked the New York National Guard to help transport the 
bodies, an aide to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral Mass at St. Joseph's Catholic Church drew 1,500 people, and 1,000 
others who could not get in stood outside the church. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, outside the Bronx funeral home across the street from St. Joseph's, 
the street was crowded with people waiting to pay their respects. The dead were 
among 87 people killed early Sunday inside the Happy Land social club. 
</P>
<P>
Three women fainted as the crowd waited to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Alvarez, mourning his brother Denny, 22, left the Rivera Funeral Home 
sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
On the steps of the church, Denny's father, Pedro, tearfully vented his rage at 
Julio Gonzalez, 36, the man accused of setting the fatal fire in a quarrel with 
an ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to take him and give him a public hanging," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, family members of the victims met with American Red Cross 
officials at a public school near the burned-out red brick building to receive 
the belongings each victim carried or wore when the fire struck. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the school, Carlos Pena clutched a manila envelope that held a watch, a 
set of keys, and some cash -- things his brother Eli, 26, had with him early 
Sunday at the doomed Happy Land club. 
</P>
<P>
The watch came with Eli from Honduras, and Carlos said the timepiece would now 
be his. "It means a lot, a reminder," he said.

OAKLAND NEGOTIATOR MIGHT JUMP OFF RAIDERS WAGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Alameda County supervisor who led Oakland negotiators in fashioning the 
$660-million deal to bring the Raiders back to the Bay Area now says he will 
take steps to kill the plan himself if opponents in Oakland succeed in 
obtaining a popular referendum on it. 
</P>
<P>
Don Perata, who could end the necessary county participation in the Raiders 
agreement simply by changing his "yes" vote to "no," said: 
</P>
<P>
"If they are able to obtain the necessary signatures to put this on the ballot 
this fall, and if the city moves to delay action until after the November 
ballot, then I'm ready to get off the train. I'm not ready to prolong this for 
another six months." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors approved the Raiders deal on a vote of 3 to 1 with one 
abstention. If Perata changed his view, it would result in a 2-2 deadlock on 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents have until April 11 to submit 19,000 petition signatures required 
normally to qualify for a referendum, although the final decision whether a 
referendum would be legal might be made in the courts. Oakland City Atty. Jayne 
Williams has issued a legal opinion that a referendum is not a proper remedy in 
the case of Raiders football. 
</P>
<P>
Perata said emphatically he would be unwilling to try to renegotiate with the 
Raiders for terms more favorable to the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the East Bay branch of the Voter Revolt organization, 
headed by insurance reform advocate Harvey Rosenfield, said it would join in 
the petition drive to put the Raiders deal on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have also questioned whether necessary state approval will be 
forthcoming for Oakland and Alameda County to issue bonds to make initial 
payments to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Ed Snider, head of Spectacor Management Group, the 
private managers of the Coliseum, said it would be a few days yet before a new 
offer was ready to put to team owner Al Davis to keep the Raiders playing in 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

PANEL OKS RAIL LINES, INCLUDING LAX LINK; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: OTHERS WOULD RUN TO PASADENA AND ACROSS EASTERN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. 
BUT PLAN RELIES HEAVILY ON VOTER APPROVAL OF PROPOSITIONS IN JUNE. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles County transit officials voted Wednesday to build rail lines to Los 
Angeles International Airport, to Pasadena and across the eastern San Fernando 
Valley over the next 11 years, provided California voters in June approve $18.5 
billion in added statewide transportation spending and local cities also chip 
in money. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.2-billion rail-construction plan was approved by a 9-2 vote of the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The first of a new generation of rail lines -- the Long Beach-Los Angeles 
light-rail line -- is scheduled to open July 16. Nearly 60 miles of line have 
been approved and about 40 miles are now under construction. Wednesday's action 
would add nearly 22 miles to that system. 
</P>
<P>
Approved Wednesday were: 
</P>
<P>
* A 2 1/2-mile northern spur to the airport from the western terminus of the 
Century Freeway light-rail line, now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
* A 13 1/2-mile light-rail line from downtown to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
* And a 5.6-mile westward extension to the San Diego Freeway in Van Nuys of the 
Metro Rail subway being built from downtown to North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Under the schedule adopted by the commission, the LAX spur would be completed 
in 1994, the Pasadena line in 1998 and the cross-Valley line in 2001, the same 
year that Metro Rail is scheduled to reach North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan rests heavily on the hope that California voters on June 5 will 
approve ballot propositions raising the gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon over 
five years and allowing the sale of billions of dollars in rail construction 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Without the $1.2 billion anticipated from the state if the propositions pass, 
commissioners say they probably will have only enough money to build one more 
line in this century. The other $1 billion would come from city treasuries and 
the extra half-cent sales tax that county voters approved in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We're betting on the come here," said County Supervisor Ed Edelman, who chairs 
the commission, using gambler's jargon for putting hoped-for future winnings at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to relying on statewide voter approval of the transportation 
propositions, the commission plan assumes that affected cities -- Los Angeles, 
Pasadena and South Pasadena -- will contribute $309 million toward 
construction, or that the projects can be scaled back by that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Costs could be cut by elimination of stations and building some sections with 
only single tracks for now, commission staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents an East Valley 
district, predicted the city would not contribute more money unless the 
commission alters its schedule to get the Metro Rail subway to North Hollywood 
earlier than 2001. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect there are enough votes on the City Council to make that not a threat 
but a reality," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
Other elected officials also pressured the commission, which consists of the 
five county supervisors, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, four council members 
from various cities and one public member. 
</P>
<P>
Declared Alhambra City Councilman Michael Blanco: "We desire, we deserve and we 
demand that the Pasadena line be built first." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Valley line, estimated to cost $1.3 billion, would be built in the 
Southern Pacific railroad right-of-way that parallels Chandler and Victory 
boulevards. In the industrial area between Hazeltine Avenue and the line's 
terminus at the San Diego Freeway south of Victory Boulevard, the tracks would 
be at ground level. They would run underground in residential areas of North 
Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena line would be built through Northeast Los Angeles in the Santa Fe 
Railroad right-of-way that roughly parallels the Pasadena Freeway and Arroyo 
Parkway. At the Foothill Freeway, it would be in the median to Sierra Madre 
Villa in eastern Pasadena. The line would cost an estimated $688 million. 
</P>
<P>
The LAX spur, which carries a $215-million price tag, would cut across one of 
the airport's long-term parking lots, where airport-bound passengers would 
transfer to shuttle buses or a people-mover, then end about half a mile north 
in Westchester.

JURY AWARDS PARAPLEGIC $7.65 MILLION FROM CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A woman who was paralyzed when she was hit by a car in a police chase has won a 
$7.65-million verdict against the city of Los Angeles, the largest amount ever 
awarded in a liability case against the city, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Susan Tartakoff, 41, was paralyzed from the chest down in 1985 when 
a car that had been traveling as fast as 100 miles an hour slammed into her car 
at an intersection in Chatsworth, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in Superior Court, Tartakoff claimed the car was being 
chased by Los Angeles police officers who failed to turn on their squad car's 
siren. 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff was a computer programmer at Universal Studios. She has spent the 
years since the crash in extensive physical therapy, but remains paralyzed from 
the chest down. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole life has changed," Tartakoff said Wednesday as she underwent physical 
therapy in a Beverly Hills clinic. "I haven't been able to work. . . . My quest 
is to get back on my feet." 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff said she spends four hours a day, six days a week in physical 
therapy. She has progressed from being unable to get out of bed to moving 
herself half a mile a day around her home in Northridge with the help of 
special braces. 
</P>
<P>
"Not being able to walk is not the only thing," Tartakoff said. "Bowels and 
bladder don't function. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Since the accident I have a lot of pain, from the minute I get up to when I go 
to bed at night." 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury deliberated most of last week before agreeing on the 
award, according to Tartakoff's attorney, Tim Wheeler. The jury awarded her $7 
million and her husband, Ray, $675,000 for loss of consortium, Wheeler said. 
The couple have no children. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler said evidence at the trial showed that police chased the speeding car, 
driven by a 19-year-old, for more than 1 1/2 miles before it slammed into 
Tartakoff's car about 8 p.m. on Jan. 11, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Douglas Gray of Panorama City, ran a red light at the intersection 
of Devonshire Street and Winnetka Avenue, where the collision occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The police officers denied they were chasing Gray's car at the time of the 
crash, according to John T. Neville, head of the civil liability section of the 
city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The officers had noticed Gray driving in circles before he spotted them and 
sped away, Neville said. But they either decided not to chase him or abandoned 
the chase before the collision, Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on whether to appeal the verdict will be made after post-trial 
motions are heard, Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
Neville and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said that it is the highest liability 
loss for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The huge award is the latest in a series of unexpectedly costly awards and 
settlements against the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city had budgeted $15 million for such losses in this year, which ends June 
30, but more than $20 million has already been spent, said Yaroslavsky, 
chairman of the Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
With only $5 million left in the city's reserve fund, it is unclear where the 
money to pay the Tartakoff award will come from, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to go to the reserve fund, it's not there," Yaroslavsky said. 
"These bills are flying at us like missiles from every direction." 
</P>
<P>
The money may have to come from funds set aside for other city programs, such 
as recycling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray also was a defendant in the suit and his insurance may pay for some of the 
award, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler said the police officers violated Police Department pursuit policies by 
not turning on their sirens during the chase. 
</P>
<P>
The two police officers involved in the incident, Jay Phillips and David Perry, 
have not been disciplined by the department, Cmdr. William Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Booth declined to comment on the specifics of the case because litigation may 
not be over. Under department policy, he said, officers in pursuit in squad 
cars must turn on their red lights and sirens. But he said that if officers are 
simply following a car with no intention of stopping it, lights and sirens are 
not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who had minor injuries, was convicted in 1986 of driving under the 
influence of drugs as well as other charges stemming from the incident and was 
sentenced to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff said Wednesday she had been on her way home from a video store with 
some rented movies. 
</P>
<P>
As she crossed the intersection, she had a green light and did not see Gray's 
car coming toward her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to her attorney, eyewitnesses said the police were at the scene 
within seconds of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff said she is not yet counting on the money because of possible 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had ups and downs," she said. "But I've got to keep going ahead with 
this. . . . It's not over yet. It's not over yet."

SUSPECT HAD A HISTORY OF ROUGHNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ and MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former child-care worker held in the kidnap-murder of a Northridge boy had 
a history of rough behavior with students, once dragging a child across a floor 
and another time forcing children to clean up vomit, according to PTA records. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the 31st District Parent Teacher Student Assn. said Wednesday that 
child-care employees had over the last year recorded numerous complaints about 
the behavior of Gregory Scott Smith, who had worked part-time at 10 of the 17 
day-care centers operated by the PTA in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 21, of Canoga Park is suspected of killing 8-year-old Paul Bailly, who 
disappeared after being dropped off by his mother at the Darby Avenue School 
day-care center Friday. The boy was later found burned beyond recognition in a 
field near Simi Valley in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the complaints recorded in log books date back nearly a year. In an 
April, 1989, incident at the Darby school, Smith dragged a girl across the 
floor, causing rug burns on her shoulder. In another instance, Smith was 
reported to have made a boy cry after hitting him with a ball during a rough 
game of dodge-ball. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has not been charged in the killing, was fired March 6 from his job 
as a child-care assistant at the Darby school after a series of complaints by 
superiors, including two incidents involving the victim, PTA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Records from February show that Smith had been reprimanded by superiors for 
wrongly punishing Paul Bailly. In another instance, Smith was reported to have 
made a cruel remark to the boy about the way he was dressed. 
</P>
<P>
Although child-care officials had known about some of the complaints involving 
Smith as early as last fall, other incidents are only now being discovered from 
a review of logbooks kept at day-care centers, said Harold Kuhn, executive 
director of the PTA's Project Latchkey, a nationally recognized school 
child-care program. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier knowledge of the complaints, however, could not have prevented Paul's 
death, PTA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before working at Darby, Smith was dismissed from an afternoon job at 
Chatsworth Park School on Dec. 7. His firing there followed repeated complaints 
by the director that Smith failed to obey orders to curtail his occasionally 
rough treatment of children, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, a parent at Andasol Avenue School complained that Smith, who 
was working as a substitute there, had forced two children to clean up 
another's vomit as punishment for "giving Greg a hard time," according to a log 
record of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said that after learning of the incident he immediately restricted Smith 
from working at other schools as a substitute, but allowed him to keep his 
position at Darby Avenue School. 
</P>
<P>
"I called the mother and apologized and told her that he would never be at 
Andasol again," said Kuhn, who called the punishment used by Smith "terrible 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said he did not fire Smith at the time because the center director at 
Darby did not believe Smith to be a problem worker. 
</P>
<P>
"If I blew it, I blew it," Kuhn said. "But I don't think I blew it. . . . It is 
easy now to say . . . I should have fired him.' . . . But we tried to give due 
process. We wanted to be understanding of Greg and help him." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the recorded complaints, at least five PTA child-care staff 
members had complained about Smith's behavior since last fall. Kuhn said he 
could not recall all of those complaints. 
</P>
<P>
But Cecelia Mansfield, president of the 31st District PTA, said there "was a 
clear pattern that emerged under a number of different directors" of facilities 
where Smith worked. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith was known to have problems and that he had to be watched," said a 
latchkey staff member who asked not to be identified. "He could not be trusted. 
I would think the majority of the staff felt that way -- anyone who came in 
contact with him. The problem is we don't have any formal way of telling them. 
There was no procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Another staff member said: "We don't have a formal procedure for making 
complaints. Obviously, we need one. Maybe we will now." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was arrested a day after Paul's body was found. Handcuffs, which appeared 
to have been used on the boy, were found near the body, investigators said. 
Smith is scheduled to be arraigned Monday and is being held without bail at the 
Ventura County jail. He has denied, through an attorney, any involvement in the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Lovell, chief medical examiner for Ventura County, said Wednesday that 
the boy was already dead when set on fire. The exact cause of his death was 
expected to be known today. 
</P>
<P>
Before being hired for the PTA program in September, 1988, Smith had worked as 
a volunteer for the Los Angeles Unified School District at the Nevada Avenue 
Elementary School in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had worked as an unpaid volunteer in the day-care program in the spring 
semester of 1988 to gain an experience credit in his child-care studies at 
Chatsworth High School, school Principal Tom Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevens said Smith was let go at the end of the school year because of 
problems he had with third-graders he helped care for. 
</P>
<P>
"He started out OK but before long we started noticing he was kind of rough 
with the kids," Stevens said. "He was sharp with them. Sometimes he would grab 
them by the arm and get a little physical." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said some of the children cried after being handled by Smith and there 
were a handful of complaints from parents. When Smith's high school instructor 
asked if Smith could continue at the school the next year, Stevens declined. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them no because he was causing us too many problems," Stevens said. " 
We had gotten a few calls from parents. When you start getting that you 
terminate immediately." 
</P>
<P>
PTA officials said they did not know of Smith's troubles at the Nevada school 
at the time he was hired. Smith went on to work 17 months for the PTA program. 
His firing came after Kuhn received a report from Darby that in late February 
he had left the children unsupervised to help a woman with her car alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said Smith became angry when he was told he was fired. According to a 
written account of the dismissal in PTA records, Smith threatened Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
"I will get my anger out on you . . . ," the report quotes Smith. "I don't get 
my anger out on children."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHER WHO QUIT OVER FILM WON'T BE 
REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Unified School District Board of Education this week refused to 
reinstate a seventh-grade science teacher despite pleas from the teacher and 
about 30 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Connolly, a teacher at Washington Middle School, resigned under pressure 
March 9 after a parent complained that Connolly had shown his students a nude 
scene from "The Meaning of Life," an R-rated movie by the British comedy group 
Monty Python. 
</P>
<P>
A replacement was hired that same day to fill the position for the rest of the 
year, said Vera Vignes, associate superintendent for personnel services. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly, who said he regrets showing the film clip, said he changed his mind 
about resigning last week because of overwhelming support from his students. He 
will meet with district Supt. Phil Linscomb Monday to discuss his options.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUNTMAN WAS ONE OF THE BEST, ACTOR TELLS 
JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny Glover, star of "Lethal Weapon," testified Wednesday that stuntman Dar 
Robinson, who bled to death during the filming of a movie in 1986, was "one of 
the world's greatest stuntmen." 
</P>
<P>
Glover's testimony came during the fourth week of a trial in Los Angeles 
Superior Court in which Robinson's widow is suing three movie production 
companies for damages in connection with the stuntman's death. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson died in November, 1986, while making the movie "Million Dollar 
Mystery." During a stunt, his motorcycle sped off a roadway and crashed. The 
suit against DeLaurentis Entertainment Group, DeLaurentis Film Productions and 
Productions Limited of Beverly Hills contends the producers were negligent 
because no ambulance was at the location site in Page, Ariz., 65 miles from the 
nearest hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Glover's testimony was aimed at showing that had Robinson lived, he potentially 
would have earned millions.

JURY AWARDS BLACK PROFESSOR $1 MILLION IN BIAS SUIT AGAINST COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: HE CLAIMED CLAREMONT GRADUATE SCHOOL DENIED HIM TENURE BECAUSE OF HIS 
RACE. THE DECISION WILL BE APPEALED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black professor who was denied tenure at the Claremont Graduate School has 
been awarded more than $1 million by a jury, which determined that he had been 
discriminated against because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision is a triumph over the old boys' system," attorney Godfrey Issac, 
who represented the professor, Reginald Clark, said Wednesday. The lawyer said 
he believes it is one of the first judgments of its kind regarding tenure of a 
black professor. Tenure is the coveted lifetime appointment that protects the 
academic freedom of university faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, now an instructor at Cal State Fullerton, added: 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good. Claremont is an apartheid institution disguising itself by 
tokenism hiring. I hope this sends a message throughout the country that this 
must stop." 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs argued in the three-week Los Angeles Superior Court trial that 
the issues raised by Clark symbolized the maze of discriminatory hurdles that 
most minority members face when they seek tenure. 
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that, at the time of Clark's dismissal from the 60-year-old 
Claremont institution, there had never been a tenured black, Asian or Latino 
professor. The school is part of the Claremont University Center group of 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Catherine Hagen, who defended Claremont, said the school will appeal 
the decision because certain information was not allowed into evidence. She 
added that there were "problems" with the jury instructions but would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
There had been a mistrial in the same case last year when three jurors became 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who had previously taught at Chicago State University, had been at 
Claremont five years when he applied for tenure. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that he had overheard racist remarks while the school's tenure 
committee was debating his professional future at the school in 1984. He was 
reviewing a training film in an adjacent room when he heard argumentative 
voices coming through an air duct. 
</P>
<P>
As he listened, he realized that members of the tenured faculty, who were in 
closed deliberations, were discussing his promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Clark testified that he heard such remarks as: "I don't know if I want to work 
on a permanent basis with a black man"; "We don't have to worry, we are a 
private college, we are not under obligation to have any (minorities)" and 
"White people have rights too." 
</P>
<P>
The defendants acknowledged in court testimony that the latter statement was 
made, but they denied the others. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont President John MacGuire, who said he had been one of Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr.'s freedom riders in the 1960s and was a board member of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, testified that he had 
conducted an investigation of the racism charges. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the words uttered by one of the instructors were "inappropriate" 
and that the individual had been reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
However, MacGuire contended that the school had not discriminated against Clark 
in refusing him tenure. A subcommittee of faculty members voted 5 to 4 in favor 
of tenure. But the full tenure committee voted 4 to 1 against it. 
</P>
<P>
The school argued that the reason Clark was denied a permanent post was because 
the professor had a meager publication record, an important part of the tenure 
process. 
</P>
<P>
School officials testified also that a survey was sent to 100 of Clark's 
students and 12 of the 50 that were returned contained remarks critical of him. 
</P>
<P>
Clark needed to have several articles published in professional journals -- 
articles that are printed only after rigorous review by a panel of peer 
scholars. If he had had those, he might have been granted tenure, Hagen argued. 
</P>
<P>
But the plaintiffs countered that Clark was considered an expert on 
multicultural education and had received national attention for his research on 
black children's struggles in the education system. He is author of "Family 
Life and School Achievement: Why Poor Black Children Succeed or Fail," 
published by the University of Chicago Press. 
</P>
<P>
"The book was a trailblazer in its field," Issac told the jury. "He is a man of 
vision." 
</P>
<P>
The jury, after two days of deliberation, voted 9 to 3 to award Clark $1 
million in compensatory damages for the loss of salary and for emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
It voted to award punitive damages also. In that second phase of the trial, 
Issac asked the jury to "send a message to Claremont . . . that people should 
be judged on who they are and not on the color of their face." 
</P>
<P>
A school accountant testified that the graduate school had $79 million in 
assets and $10 million in liabilities. Hagen told the jury that "$1 million is 
a whole lot for the school. You already sent them a message, and they have been 
humbled and saddened by it. Please don't punish them any more." 
</P>
<P>
The jurors spent another 45 minutes deliberating and then voted 11 to 1 to 
award Clark an additional $16,237 in punitive damages -- the amount Claremont 
had in its cash account. They said later in interviews that they heeded Hagen's 
warning that the school would have to raise students' tuition to pay for any 
punitive damages. Such awards are not not covered by any liability insurance 
that the school may hold. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to increase tuitions for students," jury foreman Sean Reaney, a 
23-year-old airline flight attendant, said. "So we thought that, by draining 
the college's active cash account, they would get the message." 
</P>
<P>
Issac said that Clark's real desire would have been to have his job at 
Claremont back. 
</P>
<P>
"But, in our system, unfortunately, only monetary judgments can be won," the 
lawyer said.

SUPERVISORS CONSIDER NEW TACTIC TO DELAY MALIBU INCORPORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials, forced by a judge's order to allow a Malibu 
cityhood election to proceed in June, may try to delay the actual incorporation 
for up to a year if residents of the seaside community vote to form a city. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution prepared for supervisors to vote on today contains a condition 
that would allow county officials to impose the delay. Ordinarily, once voters 
approve, incorporation occurs on the date results are certified, usually four 
to six weeks after an election. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver, spelled out in a copy of the resolution released this week, would 
give the county time to go forward with a long-sought sewer system in Malibu 
before a new local government has a chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates, including many cityhood supporters, have opposed the 
sewer system backed by supervisors as a prelude to widespread development. 
</P>
<P>
Elwood Lui, a lawyer for the county, called the document "not unusual" and said 
it was included "in anticipation of remarks that may be made for and against 
cityhood" at today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We think state law clearly sets forth the supervisors' right to set an 
effective date," Lui said, "but that's a decision that has to be made at the 
board meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for cityhood backers, meanwhile, said that if the supervisors try to 
use the tactic to delay incorporation, they will immediately ask a judge to 
disallow it. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wonder if they (county officials) can even sell three supervisors on 
going along with such a thing, but if they do, we intend to be in court 
immediately," said Graham Ritchie, an attorney for the Malibu Committee for 
Incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of supervisors have opposed Malibu's becoming a city for years, 
saying that the sewer system the county wants to build there needs to be under 
way before any city is formed. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have said they want sewers installed in Malibu, where homeowners 
now largely rely on septic tanks, because sewers are more sanitary and 
environmentally safe. 
</P>
<P>
Facing possible contempt citations from a judge who ordered the supervisors to 
set a Malibu election date June 5, the supervisors two weeks ago sent word by 
county lawyers that they would comply. Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs has 
ordered that the issue be the first order of business during today's Board of 
Supervisors meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers insist that imposing a condition to delay the actual 
incorporation date would make a mockery of the judge's order to stop stalling 
the election itself. 
</P>
<P>
State law makes it possible for incorporation to occur up to a year after the 
certification of votes. Malibu voters will be asked to choose five city council 
members on the cityhood ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But there is disagreement over whether the supervisors have the authority to 
impose a delay or whether that authority rests exclusively with the Local 
Agency Formation Commission, which oversees the transformations of communities 
to cities. County lawyers have expressed the view that supervisors do have such 
authority; lawyers for cityhood supporters say they do not. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for LAFCO have agreed with Malibu cityhood supporters. "Our preliminary 
analysis is that only LAFCO can impose such a condition," said Meredith Jury, 
independent counsel for the agency. "We do not believe that the county 
supervisors have the right to do that."

SURGEON ACCUSED OF TURNING AWAY PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former emergency surgeon at Panorama Community Hospital has been accused of 
turning away a critically ill patient because the patient could not afford 
treatment, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in recent months that medical personnel at the hospital 
have been accused of illegally "dumping" a patient. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Talag, who was 67 at the time, went to the Panorama City hospital April 
11, 1987, because he had been vomiting blood and felt dizzy, according to an 
"accusation" filed with the state attorney general's office by the Medical 
Board of California. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen C. Acosta briefly examined Talag and then told his relatives to 
drive him to Olive View Medical Center, a Los Angeles County facility 10 miles 
away that treats indigent patients for reduced fees, according to the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint states that the patient was transferred because Acosta "was 
concerned" that the patient "could not pay for the required hospitalization." 
The Times has received a copy of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
At Olive View, doctors found that Talag had no palpable pulse or blood 
pressure, the complaint says. Doctors managed to resuscitate him and he was 
placed in intensive care, the accusation states. Talag has since recovered, 
said Deputy State Atty. Gen. Gloria Barrios. 
</P>
<P>
The matter came to light after a physician at Olive View complained to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, of Redondo Beach, could lose his medical license if the charges are 
upheld at a hearing before a Medical Board panel in Los Angeles next Wednesday. 
He is accused of negligence, incompetence and unprofessional conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama Hospital spokeswoman Candyce Columbus declined to comment on the 
charges. Acosta could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta and the hospital could also each be fined $50,000 by the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, which is conducting its own investigation into 
the hospital's procedures, said Elliott Kramer, the department's regional 
inspector general for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, who no longer works at Panorama Hospital, is not listed as a member of 
the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., and it could not be determined whether he 
is still practicing. The state medical board issued him a physician's and 
surgeon's certificate in October, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The incident has come to light less than six months after a registered nurse at 
Panorama Community Hospital was charged with denying care to a seriously ill 
girl, whom she allegedly sent to Olive View after the girl's parents failed to 
prove they had insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Carol Nachman, 37, of Sherman Oaks, is to stand trial April 30 on the 
misdemeanor charge of failing to treat Veronica Ayala, now 2, on Dec. 8, 1988.

2 SUSPECTS IN SLAYING OF BOXER SURRENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The odds of making it as an Olympic boxer are mighty, but Cesar Cardenas, a 
young Wilmington man devoted to the sport and his family, dreamed of getting a 
crack at it. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid was a very, very superb athlete, so I would say, yeah, he had an 
outside chance of it," said Cardenas' coach, Robert Lonergan. ". . . He was a 
very dedicated, determined athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas' life came to a bloody end last May when three men and a teen-age boy 
broke into the small home in Wilmington that he shared with his mother, Maria, 
and his sister, Lourdes. The suspects robbed the family and killed Cardenas by 
shooting him twice in the head, according to Los Angeles Police Detective 
Richard Simmons. Lourdes Cardenas was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Police sought four suspects in the crimes, arresting a man and the teen-ager 
quickly. The other two surrendered Tuesday in Maryland, thanks in part to the 
television show "America's Most Wanted," as well as a campaign by Lonergan. 
</P>
<P>
The fugitives, Michael Berry, 34, and Jessie Morrison, 22, walked into the 
Rockville, Md., Police Department and gave up at the urging of Morrison's 
brother, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said Los Angeles police had contacted the show about doing a segment on 
Cardenas' murder. However, it wasn't until Lonergan entered the picture that 
the show's producers decided to do the piece, said Simmons and a spokesman for 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
Lonergan said that several weeks after police contacted the show with no 
success, he wrote his own letter recounting Cardenas' story. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the help of Lourdes, they began circulating petitions to send to the 
show's producers. He went to the boxing community for signatures; she walked 
local neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went to the gyms in Los Angeles and got all the fighters," Lonergan 
said. ". . . There is a real camaraderie in this sport." 
</P>
<P>
Lonergan estimated that more than 400 signatures were sent to the producers, 
who answered within days that they would do a piece on the boxer. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't a gang kid, he was an all-American type of kid," said Lonergan, who 
had coached Cardenas to 10 victories in 11 fights during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he was cut down like that." 
</P>
<P>
As Lonergan and police tell it, 22-year-old Cesar Cardenas was an ambitious man 
intent on making a success of himself, both as a boxer and a businessman. 
Besides training five or six times a week at a Torrance gym, he was taking 
business courses at a community college and trying to start a family printing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes Cardenas said that the family had moved from Carson to Wilmington about 
nine months before the crime. Her brother had set up the printing business in 
the garage while searching for a permanent location for it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were excited about getting the business going," said Lourdes, a single 
mother who described her brother as a "straight arrow" who was "very cautious 
about never doing anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"It was going to be a family thing," she said of the printing business. ". . . 
He had very high hopes for his family and his shop." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said that the suspects knew the Cardenas family from its days in 
Carson. On the day of the crime, the four went to the Cardenas home asking to 
have a flyer printed for an upcoming picnic for gang members, he said. Police 
later determined no picnic was planned. 
</P>
<P>
While they were at the Cardenas home, investigators allege one of the four 
stole a set of house keys from a living room table, Simmons said. They returned 
that night and entered the house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes said she was in bed with her 4-month-old girl, Natalee, when she first 
heard Cesar yell her name and then gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
Natalee "was in my arms, and when I heard the shots go off, I turned and (to 
protect her) just threw her and she landed on the floor," she said. Moments 
later Lourdes was wounded in the head and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Although the baby and Maria Cardenas escaped injury, Lourdes spent two months 
in the hospital. She said $1,000 that she had stashed in her jewelry box to pay 
maternity bills was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said that Berry and Morrison were being sought by Los Angeles Police on 
charges of murder, attempted murder, robbery and burglary. They will be 
arraigned today in Maryland and are expected to waive extradition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison was also being sought by police in Pascagoula, Miss. on a manslaughter 
charge stemming from a shooting in July, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged accomplices arrested earlier included Berry's younger brother, 
Shawn, and a juvenile. Simmons said Shawn Berry was found guilty of residential 
burglary and sentenced to four years in state prison. The juvenile was 
sentenced to a term in the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes said that "a chill went through my body" when she learned the two 
suspects had surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid that they might still be around or they might come back," she 
said. "I was always looking over my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lonergan, the father of an 11-year-old boy: "I would like my son to be 
just like Cesar when he grows up. He was a nice kid. It really hurt."

HERMOSA TIGHTENS BUILDING RULES BUT WON'T RECONSIDER STRAND HOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL REVIEW PLANS FOR ALL NEW BUILDINGS 
EXCEPT SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid charges that weaknesses in the Hermosa Beach Municipal Code allowed a 
controversial beachfront hotel to be approved without public scrutiny, the City 
Council on Tuesday broadened its powers to make sure that such projects will no 
longer slip by without local review. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new ordinance, every building proposed in the city -- except for 
single-family homes and remodeling projects or additions smaller than 1,500 
square feet -- will be reviewed by the Planning Commission to ensure that it 
will be compatible with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is likely to lower property values, interfere with the public's 
enjoyment of the area, look inappropriate in the neighborhood or adversely 
affect the environment, the commission could reject it. 
</P>
<P>
But on a narrow 3-2 vote, the council decided against forcing the developer of 
a luxury hotel planned for The Strand to undergo the new hearing process. The 
decision cleared the way for Brentwood developer David Greenwood to break 
ground late this year on a scaled-down version of the project that has divided 
opinion in the city since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The two decisions stemmed from a longtime debate over what to do with the 
city-owned site of the old Biltmore Hotel on The Strand. For 25 years, since 
the old hotel was razed, the city has squabbled over what, if any, development 
should rise in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Among the ideas was Greenwood's plan to build a five-story, 260-room hotel and 
conference center that would cover not only the Biltmore site but the adjacent 
1300 block of the beachfront street where the abandoned Strand Bathhouse now 
stands. But voters rejected the plan in 1984 amid charges that it would ruin 
the city's character, generate traffic and pollution and saddle the city with a 
financial albatross. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood and his former partner, Joe Langlois, scaled back their plans to 
include only the Strand Bathhouse block, which Greenwood now owns. As the city 
continued to struggle with plans for the Biltmore site, Greenwood presented the 
city Building and Safety Department staff with more modest plans for a 172-room 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Because the project conformed to the city's zoning code, and because the 
council had rejected earlier advice from its planning directors to broaden the 
city's powers of review, Greenwood needed only a building permit for his 
project and the approval of the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Not even an environmental impact review was needed, because Greenwood's 
proposal for a larger hotel had already undergone an EIR, and the city could 
not legally require a second one for a scaled-down version of the project, 
retired Councilman Jim Rosenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, Greenwood agreed last year to meet 42 conditions that would 
have been imposed under the old EIR. Meeting in a closed session -- because the 
decision required an opinion from the city attorney -- the council approved 
those conditions, Rosenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the public hearing usually required for such large developments 
never occurred in Hermosa Beach, and when the Coastal Commission approved the 
project this month, it was a surprise to many of the hotel's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"This hotel will set the tone for Hermosa Beach, and the people should have a 
say in that process," said Councilman Robert Essertier, who led the effort to 
belatedly hold a public hearing on the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilwoman Kathleen Midstokke warned that the city would be open to 
a lawsuit from Greenwood if the council tried to impose new conditions on his 
hotel now, with ground breaking only months away. Essertier's proposal died on 
a 3-2 vote, with only Councilman Albert Wiemans on his side. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council approved a new, broadened hearing process that Planning 
Director Michael Schubach suggested last fall. The council had rejected it 
then, fearing that it would clog Planning Commission agendas and create a 
subjective "art jury" for new development. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilman Chuck Sheldon, who had earlier charged that the new review 
process would "remove any incentive for (commercial) investment in this 
community," softened his position and joined Midstokke and Essertier in voting 
for the broadened reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Roger Creighton and Albert Wiemans opposed the measure. Creighton 
said the new layer of reviews will only raise "false hopes" among opponents of 
development because the city will still have to prove that there are 
substantial problems with a project before it can deny a permit.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO SETTLEMENT IN MATTEL PROJECT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council this week rejected a proposed settlement of a 
lawsuit that was filed by the city of Lawndale to block a redevelopment project 
in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed in August by Lawndale officials claimed that the 36-acre Mattel 
project will create traffic problems on nearby Lawndale streets. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Hawthorne officials of approving the project without 
adequately addressing environmental effects on Lawndale, which is four blocks 
away from the site. The Mattel project will be east of the San Diego Freeway at 
Rosecrans Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Redevelopment Director Bud Cormier said the Hawthorne council 
unanimously rejected the suit because "the more they thought about it, the more 
they thought they didn't do anything to deserve a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale Assistant City Atty. Robert Owen said the settlement would have 
required Hawthorne to spend almost $500,000 for new traffic signals and to 
widen lanes on streets in the northwest corner of Lawndale near Rosecrans, 
Inglewood and Marine avenues, and on Hawthorne Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Owen said the council's decision makes it likely that the case will go to trial 
May 15 in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Mattel project, approved in July, will include a 450,000-square-foot office 
center with 232,700 square feet of retail space, two restaurants and a 154-room 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
It will create an additional 17,570 daily vehicle trips in the area, according 
to an environmental impact report.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH KILLED, SISTER HURT IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Inglewood teen-ager was shot to death and his sister was injured in an 
apparent gang-related shooting Tuesday evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Macias, 15, was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Macias, 22, was treated for a minor injury at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial 
Hospital in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
The brother and sister had left a liquor store near Grevillea Avenue and 
Century Boulevard at about 6:10 p.m. when a man on foot shouted gang slogans at 
them as they entered a car. When the pair drove off, a car parked across the 
street from the store followed them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the passengers of the second car fired a shotgun at the victims, causing 
Roberto Macias to lose control of the vehicle he was driving. The gunman then 
got out of the car, ran up to the victims and fired two more shots at him. 
Police said no suspects had been arrested.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Fund Committees 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 349 to 71, the House approved a partial committee budget for 1990 
of $56.8 million, up 4.8% over the comparable 1989 authorization and 10.5% over 
actual spending last year. The measure (HR 346) will fund about half the cost 
of the House's approximately 180 committees and subcommittees, with the 
remainder supplied by separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) called the budget "conservative and responsible." 
</P>

Rural Development 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 360 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3581) 
delivering federal aid to depressed rural areas. At an estimated cost of more 
than $2 billion over five years, the bill starts new programs, realigns current 
ones and gives states more voice in funding decisions. It shifts certain 
programs from the Farmers Home Administration to a new Rural Development 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also expands the Rural Electrification Administration, eases repayment 
terms of REA and other rural loans and channels aid to communities hurt by 
curbs on timbering in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Flag Issue 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 309 to 101 to withdraw from the U. S. Supreme Court its brief 
for the 1989 law making it a crime to desecrate the American flag. This vote on 
HR 362 was a victory for Republicans who would rather protect the flag by 
constitutional amendment. They objected that the Democratic-approved brief 
asked the court to rule on the flag law in the term beginning in October. They 
saw this as a delaying tactic by Democrats who want to preserve the statute. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer this House . . . tries to bottle up the statute in the Supreme 
Court, the longer the flag goes unprotected," said James F. Sensenbrenner Jr. 
(R-Wis). 
</P>
<P>
Craig Washington (D-Tex.) said "the cheapest trick of all" is to embroil the 
flag in partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the flag brief withdrawn from the Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
<P>
Senior forwards Tyrone Paul of Morningside High School and Larry Williams of 
Chadwick have been named CIF-Southern Section basketball Players of the Year in 
their respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Paul, who led Morningside to the Ocean League title and into the Southern 
Section 3-AA playoffs as the top seed, was chosen Division III Co-Player of the 
Year with center Chris Gaines of 3-A champion Dos Pueblos High of Goleta after 
a tie vote by members of the First Interstate Bank-Amateur Athletic Foundation 
board of sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-6 Paul averaged 20.5 points a game for Morningside, which was ranked 
No. 1 in the state among Division III teams before it was stunned by Lompoc, 
83-80, in the quarterfinals of the 3-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Paul is only the third Morningside boy to be named Southern Section Player of 
the Year in basketball and the first since 1974, when Michael Santos was chosen 
3-A MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Paul heads five South Bay players selected to the All-Division III team. 
</P>
<P>
Also named to the first team were guards Martell Bland of Morningside and Steve 
Clover of Rolling Hills. Second-team honors went to junior forwards Roger 
Hendrix of Rolling Hills and Wyking Jones of St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick's Williams was selected Division V Player of the Year. The 6-5, 
205-pounder led the Dolphins to the semifinals of the Southern Section 1-A 
playoffs by averaging a team-leading 19.5 points and 12.5 rebounds a game. 
Williams was also Prep League Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
Four area players were named All-CIF in Division IV, which includes the 
Southern Section 2-AA and 2-A divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Kenny Davis of Serra and Scott Panfil of El Segundo were named to the 
first team, while El Segundo center Kenny Talanoa and Miraleste forward David 
Terrell were second-team picks. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Shon Tarver of state champion Santa Clara of Oxnard was a repeat choice 
as Division VI Player of the Year. ROB FERNAS

DIGEST: LANCASTER PROPOSED AS MINOR LEAGUE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys development company headed by former major leaguer Doug DeCinces has 
proposed to develop and operate a minor league baseball facility in Lancaster. 
A stadium would be built at the northwest end of Lancaster City Park with the 
help of the city redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement between the development company and the city will be presented 
Monday to the redevelopment agency board. The agreement requires that DeCinces 
submit detailed plans within 90 days. DeCinces played baseball at Monroe High 
in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers was honored as most valuable player on the Cal State Northridge 
men's basketball team in an awards ceremony Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a 6-foot-3 senior forward, led the Matadors in scoring (17.6 points) 
and rebounding (7.1) for the second season in a row. He also had a team-high 62 
steals (2.4 avg.). 
</P>
<P>
Kendell McDaniels was recognized as the team's top defensive player, Percy 
Fisher was most improved, Kris Brodowski received the Coaches Award and Eugene 
Humphrey won the Kiwanis Sportsmanship Award. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Smith, an All-Frontier League third basemen who hit .449 last year for 
Agoura, will miss two to three weeks because of a hairline fracture of his left 
forearm. Smith, who was batting .353, was hit by a ground ball during practice 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Noel of Cal State Northridge will redshirt this track and field season 
because of a lower-back muscle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Noel, a 1988 graduate of Crespi, placed ninth in the javelin in last year's 
NCAA Division II meet.

MCGUIRE'S GEM SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A MARK

<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino Real High left-hander Ryan McGuire's 20-strikeout performance in a 
7-2 defeat of Cleveland on Tuesday appears to be a seven-inning City Section 
record. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cal-Hi Sports magazine, which tracks state records in a variety of 
high school sports, McGuire is the first City player to have achieved the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Or so it would seem. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Cal-Hi's records are based on marks reported to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a safe assumption that he set the record," Cal-Hi's Mark Tennis said. 
"But the key word is 'reported.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tennis said that Cal-Hi has a list of several players who have recorded 20 or 
more strikeouts in a seven-inning game and that no City pitcher is on it. 
</P>
<P>
The City Section keeps no statistical baseball records, Commissioner Hal 
Harkness said. STEVE ELLING

FARES UP SINCE DEREGULATION, NEW STUDY FINDS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: A THINK TANK ARGUES THAT WITHOUT DEREGULATION FARES WOULD HAVE BEEN

<P>
A new study contends that airline ticket prices are 2.6% higher today than they 
would have been without the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, disputing recent 
Administration findings that deregulation has saved travelers money. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, 
said that although prices overall have gone down since deregulation, much of 
the credit goes to a reduction in fuel costs. It argued that without 
deregulation fares would have been even lower because competition would have 
remained stronger. 
</P>
<P>
The EPI report calls on Congress "to reconsider the experiment of airline 
deregulation" by restoring some government supervision of the industry. For 
example, it proposed that ticket prices be regulated so that they reflect 
costs, not market forces between cities. 
</P>

Paul S. Dempsey, a University of Denver transportation law professor and author 
of the study, "Flying Blind: The Failure of Airline Deregulation," said at a 
news conference Wednesday that he employed "more rigorous" research than did 
the Department of Transportation for a study with opposite conclusions that was 
released last month. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials declined to comment, saying they had not reviewed the EPI 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Administration released a report that found that air travelers 
now fly to more cities and at lower fares than they did under government 
regulation. In releasing the results of the nine-month study, Transportation 
Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said it was the "most comprehensive airline 
competition study conducted by the government since deregulation." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that "pockets of problems" existed under deregulation, Skinner 
declared it a success and vowed to fight any effort to restore government 
control. "Deregulation has worked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the EPI study contends that the government report was flawed because 
it failed to consider the declining cost of fuel after 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey, who supported deregulation as an attorney for the Civil Aeronautics 
Board, said airline ticket prices were on a downward trend before deregulation 
and would have continued to go down even more. 
</P>
<P>
The study noted that between 1967 and 1978, ticket prices dropped an average of 
about 30% even though fuel prices rose about 50%. In contrast, fuel prices fell 
about 25% in the decade after deregulation, while ticket prices fell 28%. 
</P>
<P>
The EPI study also blamed deregulation for the growth of hub-and-spoke service, 
in which airlines center their operations at one or more airports and dominate 
service there. The resulting lack of competition has produced poorer service, 
narrower margins of safety, fewer nonstop trips and less service to small 
towns, the report argued. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying has become a rather unpleasant experience," the report concluded. "The 
planes are filthy, delayed, canceled and overbooked, our luggage disappears, 
and the food is processed cardboard. Chronic delays, missed connections, 
near-misses and circuitous routing all are products of hub-and-spoking, adopted 
by nearly every major airline." 
</P>
<P>
The report proposed the establishment of an independent Federal Transportation 
Commission, which would regulate all transportation in the nation. Such a 
commission, patterned after the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, would not be controlled by any transportation mode, as was 
the old Civil Aeronautics Board, Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report called for a prohibition of airlines holding a dominant 
presence at more than one airport, effectively breaking up the multiple hub 
operations of several of the nation's largest air carriers. "Hub concentration 
translates into escalating fares," the report said.

corporations and individuals.

3 FORMER FUJITSU SYSTEMS EMPLOYEES FILE BIAS SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three former Fujitsu Systems of America employees have filed a wrongful 
termination lawsuit against their former employer and its Japanese parent, 
alleging that they were discriminated against on the basis of race and national 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks up to $70 million in compensatory and punitive damages and was 
filed in San Diego County Superior Court by Frank Ensign, 59, the company's 
former chief financial officer; Terence Turnbull, 53, the former vice president 
of marketing, and Esther White, 64, who was Ensign's executive secretary. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the plaintiffs are Caucasians who say they lost their jobs because 
they were not Japanese, their attorney, Nicholas Boylan, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The three were among 45 Fujitsu Systems employees who were laid off in April, 
1989, in what a company source described as a reorganization. The job cuts 
brought the total Fujitsu Systems of America payroll down to 655 employees, of 
whom 378 work in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A subsidiary of Japan-based computer giant Fujitsu Ltd. with worldwide sales 
off $18 billion, Fujitsu Systems of America makes point of sale terminals, 
hand-held accounting systems and automated bank teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
Boylan said his three clients were in effect subsequently replaced by Japanese 
employees of Fujitsu and thus were the victims of "pernicious and malicious 
race, age and national origin discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
A Fujitsu Systems of America official who asked not to be identified said the 
suit was without merit, but added that the company had not yet had a chance to 
review it. 
</P>
<P>
"(Discrimination) would be hard for them to substantiate with the new 
reorganization and new job responsibilities," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Boylan said Ensign and Turnbull were both recruited by Fujitsu from other 
companies and that both were earning salaries in excess of $150,000 at the time 
of the layoff.

4TH-QUARTER GNP REVISED UPWARD TO 1.1% ANNUAL RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economy grew at a 1.1% annual rate in the final three months of 1989, 
better than the 0.9% rate estimated a month ago but still the weakest quarterly 
performance in more than three years, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In its second and final revision of fourth-quarter gross national product, or 
GNP, the department said consumer spending was slightly higher than earlier 
estimated and the buildup in stocks of unsold goods was less than previously 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
But the fourth-quarter rate of growth was the weakest GNP expansion since the 
third quarter of 1986, when the economy expanded at a weak 0.8% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
The department said corporate profits after taxes, which had fallen in each of 
the three preceding quarters, rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$156.7 billion in the final three months of 1989 from $152.4 billion in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But corporate profits for the full year fell 4.7% to $160.9 billion after 
taxes, from the 1988 total of $168.9 billion. In 1988, after-tax profits had 
risen 18.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Economists had expected GNP would be unrevised at a seasonally adjusted 0.9% 
rate. The preliminary estimate of economic growth for the fourth quarter, made 
in January, showed only a 0.5% rate of expansion. But that figure was revised 
upward in February to 0.9% before Wednesday's final 1.1% figure. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year 1989, total goods and services output increased at an 
inflation-adjusted rate of 3.0%, compared to 4.4% in 1988 and 3.7% in 1987. It 
was the weakest annual growth rate since 1986, when the economy grew by only 
2.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the implicit price deflator, a broad gauge of inflation that 
measures price changes on a basket of goods and services, rose 3.2% in the 
fourth quarter, the same as previously estimated and the same as in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The economy slowed sharply late in 1989 as the industrial sector slumped under 
the impact of weak auto sales and a softening of new orders. 
</P>
<P>
Most forecasts for 1990 anticipate sluggish economic growth in the first half 
of the year, with the rate of activity picking up in the final six months. In a 
joint report to Congress published this week, the Treasury Department and the 
U.S. trade representative's office predicted real GNP expansion of 2.4% in 1990 
and 3.2% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But weaker corporate profits are a worrisome sign of economic stress for 
policy-makers, because they can adversely affect business spending and 
investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The rate of consumer price increases slowed to 0.5% in February from an 
exceptionally high 1.1% in January but remains high enough that the Fed has 
given no indication it intends to loosen its restraining grip on interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign of slower economic growth, the department said business investment 
during the fourth quarter last year fell at a 5.4% rate compared to an increase 
of 5.2% in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of demand for the 
economy's goods and services, rose by a slim 0.5% in the fourth quarter after 
expanding by 5.6% in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The department said personal consumption spending rose $3.6 billion in the 
final three months last year, a revision upward from the $2.5-billion gain 
estimated previously, but down from a $36.4-billion increase in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The department said real spending on long-lasting durable goods decreased by 
$16.1 billion in the quarter after rising by $11.5 billion in the third 
quarter, mainly because of reduced motor vehicle sales at the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods purchases increased by $300 million after a rise of $11.1 
billion in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The department said business inventories during the fourth quarter grew by 
$22.2 billion, down from $26.2 billion estimated a month ago but up from $21.9 
billion in the third quarter last year.

ACTIVISTS GET PARTIAL WIN IN MITSUI DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALISA SAMUELS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a partial victory for consumer activist groups, the Federal Reserve Board 
said Wednesday that it may hold a public hearing on how well Mitsui Bank Ltd. 
and its California subsidiary serves the U.S. communities from which it takes 
its deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The decision comes months after more than 30 consumer groups protested Mitsui's 
proposed merger with Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. to become the world's largest bank. 
The protesters claimed Tokyo-based Mitsui and its Los Angeles-based subsidiary, 
Mitsui Manufacturers Bank, violated the 1977 federal Community Reinvestment Act 
(CRA) by engaging in "redlining," refusing to provide residential, commercial 
or consumer loans to blacks, Latinos and low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
The act requires bank regulators to examine whether a bank is meeting community 
credit needs when it seeks to acquire another bank. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling is the first time in California history that the federal agency has 
called for a hearing on a foreign-owned bank's community reinvestment 
activities here, said Robert Gnaizda, head of Public Advocates, a San Francisco 
public interest law firm and an attorney for the Greenlining Coalition, a group 
that challenged the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed in effect is saying Mitsui's community reinvestment is "inadequate," 
Gnaizda said. "We are extremely pleased with the Federal Reserve's get-tough 
attitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said it had no jurisdiction over approving the merger of Mitsui and 
Taiyo Kobe, because both are based in Japan. However, the Fed did approve an 
application by a merged Mitsui and Taiyo Kobe to acquire Taiyo Kobe's New 
York-based trust company. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry W. Johnston, president of Mitsui Manufacturers, said: "We are quite 
confident that our CRA record . . . will be seen by the board." 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui Manufacturers is currently developing a plan that details how it meets 
community needs. This plan, if it shows community reinvestment activities that 
are deemed adequate by the Fed, presumably could result in a cancellation of 
the hearing.

Original Boeing 747 Retired: The Boeing 747 that ushered in the age of the 
jumbo jet made its final flight before going into retirement at the Museum of 
Flight in Seattle. The red and white 747 rolled off Boeing's assembly line in 
Everett, Wash., on Sept. 30, 1968, and made its first flight Feb. 9, 1969. 
Since its first flight, the original 747 has served as a test plane for making 
refinements in the jumbo jet, including aerodynamic improvements and 
development of an automatic piloting system.

PEOPLE: MUTUAL FUND WHIZ IS SET TO RETIRE AT AGE 46 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Investment wizard Peter Lynch announced Wednesday that he was retiring as head 
of the nation's largest stock mutual fund, finishing a phenomenally successful 
career to spend more time with family and community. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent about 21 years with Fidelity," said Lynch, 46. "I'd like to spend 21 
years doing something different." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch managed the Magellan mutual fund for Fidelity Investments for 13 years, 
guiding it through years that saw both bull markets and the Wall Street crash 
to establish a record of strong growth and performance. 
</P>
<P>
The stock fund now has $13 billion in assets, compared to about $100 million in 
1981, when it became publicly available to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Helping draw assets was the fund's performance: $10,000 invested in the fund on 
May 31, 1977, would have grown to $270,007 on Dec. 31, 1989, according to 
Fidelity estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch also amassed a personal fortune, estimated by Boston magazine at $25 
million, and now wants to spend his days more leisurely with his wife and three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch noted that his father died of cancer at age 46. "There's nothing magic 
about 46," he said. "But you think about those things." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, who officially retires May 31, will join the board of trustees for 
Fidelity, the nation's largest operator of mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Chairman and Chief Executive Edward C. Johnson III issued a statement 
saying, "Even if he never invests another dollar, Peter Lynch has won a place 
of honor in the history of money management." 
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, when it was the nation's largest common stock fund, 
Magellan has outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 by an average of 6% 
annually, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Underpinning Lynch's success was his method of long-term investing in sound 
companies, rather than trying to outguess the market as a whole -- a strategy 
he outlined in his best-selling book, "One Up on Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this success, Lynch said in recent months that it was becoming more 
difficult to find under-performing stocks that can yield big returns, because 
stock prices have continued their annual growth. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said Magellan now has about 13% of its assets in cash, about $1.7 
billion, a level company officials say is an all-time high for the fund. 
</P>
<P>
"What you need is a drop in the market or a big recession for big winners," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lynch said he's still finding stocks to invest in and is confident the 
Magellan fund can continue outperforming the stock market as a whole. "Fidelity 
is loaded with talented people," he said. "It's possible Magellan will do 
better in the next five years with another person." 
</P>
<P>
Magellan's new portfolio manager will be Morris Smith, 33, currently manager of 
Fidelity OTC Portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's fund, which focuses on smaller companies listed in the national 
over-the-counter market, also has performed well. In the five years ended Dec. 
31, the fund had an annualized average return of 25.05%, compared to 13.96% for 
all small company growth funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan shareholders will be notified of the changes in the fund's annual 
report, due to be mailed in May, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Joy Smith, a Fidelity spokeswoman, said the company was not immediately seeing 
many redemption orders from Magellan investors in the wake of Lynch's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch wouldn't specify how he plans to spend his time, but he lamented that he 
hasn't seen any Boston College hockey games this year even though the school is 
one of four finalists vying for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's out of balance," he said.

MAGNA BACKERS INDICTED FOR STOCK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four former promoters of a defunct Thousand Oaks company have been named in a 
42-count criminal indictment unsealed by a grand jury in Los Angeles Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The charges, stemming from the rapid rise and collapse of the stock of Magna 
Technologies in 1985, include multiple counts of conspiracy and securities and 
wire fraud. The indictment says Magna was a "shell corporation" with no assets 
that was used by the defendants to profit by manipulating its stock. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the indictment were Jacob Rubenstein, formerly of Woodland Hills; 
Robert Gutstein, an Agoura Hills plastic surgeon who was Magna's chairman; 
Robert Victor of Las Vegas, and Herbert Stone, a former New York stockbroker. 
Rubenstein, Gutstein and Victor all held large blocks of Magna shares; Stone 
was the primary market maker for the stock. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment was returned by the grand jury March 7. 
</P>
<P>
Magna once claimed to have plans to market such unusual products as a 
45,000-volt "stun gun," an "insta-cup" to make instant soup, a device to help 
sexually impotent men and a hand-held, battery-powered pain reliever. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Walsh, assistant U.S. attorney, said Tuesday that the company "didn't 
produce any products" during the period identified in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Rubenstein, Gutstein, Stone and four others were also named in a civil suit 
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May, 1987, which accused 
them of manipulating Magna stock. The defendants entered summary judgments in 
which they did not admit or deny guilt but agreed to stop the activities cited 
in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Rubenstein and the others used fraudulent schemes 
to manipulate Magna's stock, including inducing friends and relatives to set up 
accounts to trade in Magna stock to create the impression of interest in the 
stock. However, Rubenstein and the others actually controlled the accounts, it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also says the defendants ordered Magna stock without intending 
to pay for it -- a practice called "free-riding" -- and when actual investors 
tried to sell Magna stock, they refused or failed to execute the sell order. 
They also released false and misleading information about the company's 
products, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Magna's stock rose from 50 cents a share in March, 1985, to a peak of $9.50 in 
September, 1985. During that time, the defendants made more than $1 million in 
profits by selling their shares. Soon after, the stock collapsed and became 
virtually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said Rubenstein is a fugitive. David L. Kagel, Rubenstein's former 
attorney, said he hadn't seen him in more than a year and didn't know where he 
was.

<P>
MONTANA EVENTS RAISE QUESTIONS ON WHEN KIDS MAY SPURN PARENTS' RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LIVINGSTON, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some aspects of his parents' religion have been more difficult to adjust to 
than others for Chris Gilbert, 16. He has managed, for instance, to tune out 
the keening chants his mother listens to constantly on a continuous-play 
cassette. 
</P>
<P>
But he has had a harder time ignoring the looming prospect that he soon may be 
forced to live under the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert's parents belong to the Church Universal and Triumphant, a religious 
group that has been in the news in recent weeks because its leader, Elizabeth 
Clare Prophet, has prophesied nuclear war in late March or April. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of this predicted cataclysm, thousands of Prophet's followers, 
including Gilbert's parents, have moved to Montana's Paradise Valley, where 
they have dug 45 extensively equipped bomb shelters, the largest capable of 
holding 756 people. 
</P>
<P>
When Prophet gives word that an attack is inevitable, an estimated 2,500 church 
members are supposed to descend for anywhere from seven months to seven years 
into their shelters, "like gophers down a hole," as one of Gilbert's friends 
put it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known for a long time I wasn't going to go underground," Gilbert said in 
a recent interview at the foster home where he now lives. "When you don't 
believe in it (Prophet's teachings), and your parents and all their friends 
bombard you with it, it's real hard." 
</P>
<P>
The stress grew so great for Gilbert and at least four other children of church 
members in recent weeks that they left home rather than face the possibility of 
moving into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
While they have acquiesced to their parents' beliefs up to a point -- they have 
moved to Montana, for instance -- these teen-agers (and possibly more 
youngsters, say authorities, who note not all the cases have been reported to 
officials) have drawn the line at following their mothers and fathers into bomb 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
And by their actions, they have thrust themselves into what has become a 
Montana tempest that tests the practice of some of the most fundamental 
American rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one is even close to going to court, the events in Livingston have 
raised thorny legal issues and a divisive local debate over questions such as: 
</P>
<P>
* Do youngsters have a right to religious freedom, and may they contest their 
parents' attempts to compel them to follow a particular belief? 
</P>
<P>
* And what role, if any, should the state play in cases where young people 
sharply disagree with their parents' religious beliefs? 
</P>
<P>
For Wolfgang Schwartz, 15, a non-church member who is the boyfriend of Chelsea 
Brannon, one of the runaways, the answers are plain. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think parents should have the right to put their kids under the ground 
against their will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining her reasons for running away in interviews with area media, Brannon 
said that although her father loves her and thinks the shelters are in his 
family's best interests, "I love myself, too. I have to look out for my own 
future too, my own safety." 
</P>
<P>
Brannon is living with her mother, a non-church member, in Seattle, Schwartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one other runaway returned home. Others are with relatives or in 
foster care. 
</P>
<P>
But, while the runaways have defined clearly for themselves the limits of 
parental rights, adults here and around the country are having a harder time 
deciding where those lines should be drawn. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether to give sanctuary to church children has divided many 
of the 12,000 residents of the mountain-fringed Paradise Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In Livingston, an Old West town full of saloons and hunting shops, an informal 
group of residents calling themselves the Network of Friends is offering 
assistance to children who wish to leave the church. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are asking is to provide them some amnesty, some space, some time," 
said Gwen Handl, one of the parents involved in helping the runaways. 
</P>
<P>
Handl and others are critical of local authorities who say the runaways must be 
returned to their homes because they have found no evidence the church children 
are being physically or emotionally abused -- factors that would be grounds for 
agency intervention. 
</P>
<P>
The Montana Department of Family Services summed up the prevailing official 
attitude in a letter to the editor of the Livingston Enterprise: "The fact that 
(Church Universal and Triumphant) members are preparing their children to enter 
bomb shelters in the event of nuclear war clearly does not fall within the 
legal definition of mental injury." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by Robert L. Mullen, director, and Bill Collins, regional 
administrator of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
And Park County Atty. Nels Swandal said in an interview that the allegations of 
abuse are "pure speculation. You don't take away (parents') rights based on 
speculation." 
</P>
<P>
Defining emotional abuse is the task of the Park County Department of Family 
Services. Social worker Rob Marchetti said he looks for evidence that a child 
is likely to harm himself or herself or suffer mental illness as a result of 
the situation at home. 
</P>
<P>
Being forced to take part in a religion you don't believe in -- no matter how 
extreme -- doesn't necessarily fit that criterion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a child is forced to take Communion on Sundays and does not believe in it, 
is that emotional abuse?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Most publicized cases in which parents' religious beliefs clash with their 
children's best interests have involved the withholding of medical treatment 
from children because of religious convictions. 
</P>
<P>
In those cases, the courts have generally ruled on the side of the children and 
their need for care, according to Rita Swan, president of Child Inc., a Sioux 
City, Iowa, organization that exists, it says, to oppose child abuse masked by 
freedom of religion claims. 
</P>
<P>
The Livingston situation is different from most, Swan said, because it hinges 
largely on the question: Can a child be abused purely by his or her parents' 
religious beliefs when there is no obvious physical threat? 
</P>
<P>
Although a conflict of belief is at the heart of the debate, church opponents 
have also called into question the physical safety of the children. Because the 
bomb shelters are stocked with weapons, some have raised concerns of a militant 
confrontation or a mass suicide such as occurred at Jonestown, the Guyana cult 
site where 913 children and adults killed themselves or were murdered at the 
command of leader Jim Jones on Nov. 18, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Church leader Prophet, in interviews, has denied any such connection. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Jones was obsessed with death," she has said. "We simply don't see death 
as a goal of life." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gilbert's father, Kent Noonan, argues that church critics are saying: 
'We're going to take your child away because you think funny.' 
</P>
<P>
"When is it somebody else's business to say, 'You're out of line in teaching 
your child?' " he asked. "This is the land of the free, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
But Roger Powalisz, a Park High School English teacher who calls himself a 
"strong believer" in religious freedom, responded: "My understanding of that 
freedom is that it is not unlimited. I don't think the state allows abuse in 
the name of religion." 
</P>
<P>
Powalisz said he has had four or five students approach him to discuss leaving 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most outspoken allies of the runaways, Father Dick Schlosser of St. 
Mary's Catholic Church in Livingston, said authorities should give greater 
weight to what the children have to say about the situation: "I would have to 
give credibility to a child if they feel they are in a threatening position." 
</P>
<P>
Experts elsewhere, however, say local authorities are acting within the law by 
not intervening. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that parents have a constitutional right to 
control the upbringing of their children, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law 
professor. That decision is based on the assumption that parents have the best 
interests of their children in mind, and, in some instances, that's a big 
assumption, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't do a whole lot to protect children in a case such as this," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Davidson, director of the American Bar Assn. Center on Children and the 
Law, agreed. "If it basically comes down to the parents having unusual 
beliefs," he said, "then probably the state can't forcibly intervene." 
</P>
<P>
Though all states, Montana included, have provisions for authorities to 
intervene in the home life of children who are suffering physical, sexual and 
emotional abuse, "emotional maltreatment is the vaguest and most difficult to 
define," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
And Gerald Larue, a USC emeritus religion professor, said fears based on 
religion alone -- even pure terror -- should not be grounds for removing 
children from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our religions are based on fear -- 'If you're not a good boy, you'll 
go to Hell,' " he said. "The only difference here is the Hell that they're 
promising is right around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kalar, a Church Universal and Triumphant spokesman, says Livingston 
residents simply hope to use debate over the runaways to discredit the church. 
Church critics are "looking to grab a child and make headlines with her," he 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the notion that children might be traumatized by church teachings, 
Kalar referred to a television movie about survivors of nuclear war and said, 
"I don't think this is anything more traumatic than watching 'The Day After.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kalar and three parents of the runaways told Park County Sheriff Charley 
Johnson that their children were being recruited by the Network of Friends in 
an "organized, premeditated effort." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that Kalar told him that church parents would file complaints 
against anyone harboring their children in the future. 
</P>
<P>
If the situation continued, "they said the potential for violence was pretty 
good," Kalar said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to parental complaints, county attorney Swandal has said that any 
adult who harbors church runaways will be charged with "custodial 
interference." 
</P>
<P>
Some network members admit they would be reluctant to help a runaway now that 
there have been threats of arrest and parental violence. 
</P>
<P>
Yet others are undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
"These children are really being traumatized. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment 
to help others," said Schlosser. 
</P>
<P>
April 23, 1990, is the date on which 25,800 years of karma will come due, 
resulting in apocalypse, according to Prophet, whose group, once based in 
California, began buying land in the Paradise Valley in 1981, nine years to 
doomsday. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for The End proceeded at first at a leisurely pace on the 
33,000-acre spread near the northern border of Yellowstone National Park. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent months, as the countdown continues, work on the shelters has 
become more frenzied. Through blinding spring snows and temperatures in the 
single digits, church members have labored to complete the shelters and to 
stock them with books, boots, toys, blankets, syringes, dried food and other 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Church spokesmen have not denied reports that the shelters also will be equiped 
with straitjackets and Valium in case anyone gets out of control in the close 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating troubles with confined children, shelter covenants have also 
spelled out that misbehaving youngsters may be disciplined with food 
deprivation and cold water dunks. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how many children of church members stand to be affected 
by the specter of the shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen say they don't know how many people are in the church, let alone how 
many children it has. 
</P>
<P>
The public schools don't keep records of religious affiliation, so they have no 
way of taking a head count, said Billie Fleming, Park County schools 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Though some church children attend public schools, the church also runs its own 
schools, she said. Reported enrollment for Church Universal and Triumphant 
schools as of November, 1989, was 198. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming said church children tend to be superior students, but that in recent 
weeks, some have experienced difficulties concentrating. As the prophesied 
doomsday approaches, teachers have also reported a greater number of absences 
among church children, Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hopkins, an eighth-grade teacher at the Livingston Middle School, also 
has seen a change in his students as April 23 nears. Some of the church 
students "look really out of it," he said. "I think there are a lot of them in 
a panic right now, just by the looks on their faces." 
</P>
<P>
And Schlosser observed that students at St. Mary's School are "very agitated, 
anxious. They just don't know from day to day what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the urgency the children feel, Schlosser told a story about an 
elementary school student who showed up for class one day without her books. 
When the teacher asked where they were, she said she had already taken them 
down in the bomb shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert's father, Noonan, 36, said he talked at length with his three sons to 
allay fears they may have about the preparations for war. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole reason we're building shelters is so we don't have to fear," he told 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing this out of paranoia. There's a possibility the Soviets could 
do something," said Noonan, who, like other church members, believes recent 
events in Europe have been incorrectly interpreted as harbingers of peace, when 
conflict is actually imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, his son chose to leave home, not because of the shelter or the 
church, but because Chris is "a rebellious teen-ager," Noonan said. "It was 
normal kids-growing-up kinds of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Noonan said he would not have forced Chris to go underground: "We've never 
pushed our religion on him, and we never told him he was going to have to do 
anything against his will." 
</P>
<P>
Further, he said, the shelters would not be occupied purely on Prophet's whims: 
"If we do inhabit these things it will only be because you either go in there, 
or you die." 
</P>
<P>
While church officials have said the shelters will only be occupied in event of 
nuclear attack ("No war, no shelter occupancy," said church spokesman Murray 
Steinman), critics of the church believe Prophet's power over her followers is 
such that they would go underground if she told them to -- whether or not there 
was reason to go. 
</P>
<P>
It was apparently this prospect that inspired some children to run away. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local newspapers, Chelsea Brannon said she decided to 
leave when her parents began making preparations to move from their home in 
Livingston to be closer to their shelter on church land. 
</P>
<P>
Brannon said the idea of being ordered into the heavily fortified shelters 
frightened her. "All those people up there with guns . . . something is bound 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Johnson said one of his deputies alerted him that children were 
planning to run away from the church shortly before an anticipated full-scale 
drill at the shelters on March 15. 
</P>
<P>
Some did leave before the drill. One girl waited until the knock came on the 
door at 9 on a Thursday night, according to June Little, one of the adults in 
town who had contact with her. The teen-ager said a voice outside her door told 
her: "We're going under at midnight." 
</P>
<P>
Little said the girl found an excuse to go outside, then ran to the town of 
Emigrant, hiding in ditches along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"She just did not want to go into that shelter," Little said. "I know this 
(conflict over beliefs) happens everywhere, even in the Catholic and Mormon 
religions. But I just don't think what's happened here is right. There's got to 
be some protection for these kids." 
</P>
<P>
Though only five runaways have been officially reported, Sheriff Johnson said 
many more may have escaped by contacting friends and relatives, thus avoiding 
authorities altogether. 
</P>
<P>
And as the "fear time" approaches, some predict more children will flee. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are other kids in my situation who want out," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Hopkins said one of his church-member students fiddles with a portable 
radio all day, listening for the emergency broadcasting signal. 
</P>
<P>
"Dozens of them feel trapped," he said. "They don't want to go into the 
shelters and they don't know what to do."

COLLEGE RECRUITING THE MTV WAY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: POTENTIAL STUDENTS ARE FEWER AND READING IS DECLINING, SO SCHOOLS 
ARE TRYING VIDEOS. CRITICS SAY THE TAPES ARE MISLEADING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The synthesizer music throbs with an irresistible beat. Tightly edited scenes 
of attractive young people flash by -- biking, dancing, working on computers, 
playing volleyball. Innovative video techniques superimpose moody graphics over 
live action. A seductive yet authoritative male voice narrates. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? Is this the latest MTV rock video? A commercial for beer 
or soft drinks? The opening to a new teen romance movie? 
</P>
<P>
Guess again. It's the latest college recruitment technique in an era when 
18-year-olds are harder to find than they were 10 years ago, and reportedly 
fewer of them respond to the written word. In this case, it's a video promoting 
Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, a pioneer in the use of videos to sell 
four years of college. But it could very well be a pitch for any number of 
other schools. 
</P>
<P>
About half the nation's institutions of higher learning -- world-famous Ivy 
League universities and obscure junior colleges alike -- are selling themselves 
to the VCR generation with snappy videos that extol their campuses as 
beautiful, academically excellent and fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with a generation of students who respond to visual images more 
than their predecessors," explains Joseph Allen, admissions director at UC 
Santa Cruz, which has had a recruiting tape for two years. "It's a group that 
is used to taking in information that way." 
</P>
<P>
It is also a smaller group than it used to be. The number of high school 
graduates has declined about 20% nationally in the past decade, and 
applications to colleges have been dropping, although immigration to California 
has eased the trend here. The national situation is not expected to reverse 
until the late 1990s when many children of Baby Boomers reach college age. 
</P>
<P>
That is the main reason colleges are willing to spend $20,000 to $120,000 
making videos and to brave criticism that they pander to the anti-intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
Drake has played its 3-year-old tape on MTV amid Madonna and Bruce Springsteen 
videos. The video manages to combine the promise of computer-aided studies with 
the lure of college romance. In its closing seconds, an attractive young woman 
asks a shy young man for a date though a message on a computer screen -- 
undoubtedly a powerful image for some males whose strongest relationships may 
have been with computer keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Drake officials say applications doubled because of the video and because of 
the school's new emphasis on computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
Many schools want their videos to fight a negative stereotype, explains 
Bradford Owen, president of Profilm, a Los Angeles firm that has made 17 
college videos in the past four years, including most of the ones for the 
University of California. Profilm is part of a blooming sub-industry of college 
recruiting filmmakers and video distributors. 
</P>
<P>
"Since these are image tools, what we try to do is to create an image of the 
school based on fact but enhanced by the medium," says Owen. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the one he made for UC Santa Cruz seeks to shed the old 
hippies-in-the-hills image and emphasize strong academics and mainstream career 
possibilities. UC Davis' downplays its agricultural programs and stresses how 
pleasant life there can be. UCLA's attempts to assuage fears about the school's 
enormous size. UC Riverside's emphasizes that there is plenty to do in that 
community. 
</P>
<P>
College admissions officials say the videos help families who can't afford 
cross-country trips scouting potential schools for their youngsters. The tapes 
give a sense of what a campus looks like and what it offers, they say, and are 
not so different from a catalogue with pretty color pictures of autumn leaves 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the end tool. It's sort of the very beginning," says Joan Paschal, a 
recruiting expert at the Washington, D.C.-based Council for Advancement and 
Support of Education. "You want to catch the person's attention, make them want 
to find out more about the campus. And then the more traditional 
decision-making process kicks in." 
</P>
<P>
But some counselors and schools remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Burtnett, executive director of the National Assn. of College Admission 
Counselors in Alexandria, Va., worries that the videos are "too slick, too 
Madison Avenue" and stress parties and sports over course work and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"There is the potential, I think, to give the students what the students would 
like to see rather than what the students need to see," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental College in Los Angeles is one of the holdouts. Officials there 
decided they would rather put money into personal visits to high schools around 
the country instead of into videos, spokeswoman Frances Hill says. Besides, she 
sniffs, "the kind of students we are trying to attract are more oriented toward 
reading than looking at videos. . . . A student who comes to Oxy has to be 
prepared to work really hard and to do a lot of reading, and they are best 
approached through the printed word or in person." 
</P>
<P>
And Caltech seems close to abandoning its 4-year-old video, which circulates 
through various rental and free-viewing distribution networks to schools and 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some benefit from it. But my perception is that the persons 
mainly benefiting are the filmmakers," says Dan Langdale, Caltech admissions 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Viewings of 20 college videos, which usually run from 5 to 30 minutes each, 
showed that some schools seriously attempt to explain their curricula, faculty, 
student bodies and surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
But more often, the tapes are numbingly similar -- highlighting sports teams, 
tight-sweatered cheerleaders, handsome joggers in sylvan settings, class 
discussions on lawns, fancy laboratory equipment and computer workstations. Any 
nearby river, beach, ski mountain or cultural center tends to figure 
prominently in the filming. And the music rarely stops. 
</P>
<P>
Students giving testimonials are carefully chosen for ethnic diversity, and all 
attest to the faculty's friendliness and availability. 
</P>
<P>
Professors so tout "excellence" of academic programs that differences blur 
among, for example, Cornell University, Flagler College in Florida, the 
University of Pennsylvania or Green Mountain College in Vermont -- schools that 
differ greatly in their standards for admission and graduation. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, counselors, parents and students say today's young people 
are video-sophisticated enough to be able to sift reality from hype. Some 
videos backfire, they say, by focusing too much on a particular type of student 
or on an obviously staged event. 
</P>
<P>
For example, John Vosmek, a high school senior in Portland, Ore., said he and 
his parents watched about 10 college videos recently and had some fun with the 
repeated bromide: "The biggest problem at this campus is that there are too 
many classes and activities to choose from." 
</P>
<P>
But Vosmek said he found the videos useful for gaining a general sense of the 
nine East Coast schools to which he has applied. This spring, after the 
colleges decide whether they want him, he plans to tour the schools that said 
yes and choose one. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Bingham, who helps counsel college-bound students at Bonita Vista High 
School in Chula Vista, said the videos' benefits outweigh any drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a PR kind of thing and a sales pitch, but kids don't really have an 
opportunity to experience a lot of the colleges any other way," she said. "It 
usually generates more questions in their minds for when they finally get down 
to the campus." 
</P>
<P>
Higher education is taking other marketing steps to cope with the declining 
number of teen-agers. Many schools are tailoring courses and schedules to 
appeal to older students already in the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges are casting a wider geographic net, sending recruiters to high schools 
and college fairs in parts of the country they would not have visited a few 
years ago. Applicants are being invited to more frequent and more elaborate 
campus parties, and professors are pressed to write more letters urging 
promising students to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
But videos have the advantage of reaching a much wider audience, college 
officials say. Realizing that an amateurish video can turn off potential 
applicants, most colleges have dropped in-house shows produced by film students 
and have hired professional filmmakers. About 25 film companies around the 
country now specialize in college recruiting and compete strongly for new 
business. 
</P>
<P>
And the competition for students has spawned a cottage industry of video 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a few years ago attorney Shelly Spiegel noticed how inconvenient 
it was for her younger brother, then in high school, to ask individual colleges 
for their tapes. So she quit practicing law and founded College Home Videos, a 
Philadelphia mail-order company that distributes the videos of nearly 100 
schools, partly through an order list inside the well-known Peterson's college 
guides. 
</P>
<P>
Potential applicants usually pay $4 per video. Colleges pay $3,000 a year each 
to be part of the network, although some make extra arrangements for Spiegel to 
send their tapes free of charge to good prospects. Altogether, she estimates, 
the firm annually sends out about 50,000 copies of college videos. 
</P>
<P>
Other firms, such as Learning Resources Network in Durham, N.C., and College 
U.S.A. in Gaithersburg, Md., place laser-disc machines with large selections of 
the college shows into high school counseling offices and also offer 
videocassettes that can be taken home free of charge. In addition, College 
U.S.A. plays its tapes on the cable television Learning Channel. 
</P>
<P>
LRN president Robert Chapman, a former college video producer, urges college 
administrators to carefully consider what message they want to send to 
potential freshmen and what kind of freshmen they want. 
</P>
<P>
"A skillfully produced video can have enormous influence on its viewers, an 
impact that can probably only be matched by a visit to the campus or by the 
influence of a parent, trusted friend or adviser," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, young people are quick to pick up that message. In a reversal of 
the usual marketing trend, high school seniors are starting to send elaborate 
videotaped presentations of themselves and their skills as part of their 
college applications. 
</P>
<P>
However, Burtnett of the national counselors association cautions high school 
students that expertise with home video recorders will not replace 
old-fashioned ability to write an application essay. So videocassettes of 
speeches, piano recitals, athletic performances and some wacky home movies are 
piling up unwatched in admissions offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Colleges are just beside themselves about this," Burtnett says. "They are not 
looking at them."

FOR DISABLED, ACCESSIBLE HOUSING IS INACCESSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERTA G. WAX, Wax is a Northridge free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Smith has been living in the same Encino apartment for more than 14 
years. He says it's not the greatest place for him, but he's lucky to have it 
and has adapted it to suit his needs. 
</P>
<P>
He has tried looking for other quarters, but they're never quite right -- maybe 
there are stairs he can't climb, or hallways he can't negotiate, or a bathroom 
too small to accommodate a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
For a disabled person, the choice of accessible, affordable housing in the San 
Fernando Valley is exceedingly limited. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nearly impossible to find a truly accessible apartment," said Smith, an 
activist for the disabled and past president of Los Angeles' Advisory Council 
on Disability. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, those whose handicaps are most severe have better chances of 
finding suitable housing. On one hand, there are special facilities for the 
severely disabled. On the other, "The more severely disabled you are, the less 
you need special housing, because you will have an attendant," said Janet A. 
Neal, current president of the city's disability council and member of a new 
mayoral commission formed to deal with problems of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who basically can take care of themselves, it is hard to find 
apartments with extra-wide hallways and doors, bathtub grab bars, sinks that a 
person in a wheelchair can reach, or for the hearing-impaired, smoke alarms 
that flash instead of buzz. 
</P>
<P>
And when a place to live finally is found or adapted to accommodate special 
needs, a disabled person can be virtually a social prisoner there, because 
chances are friends and neighbors live in houses that pose architectural 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"Accessible housing for the disabled is very slim in the Valley," said Linda 
Slack, a housing coordinator with United Cerebral Palsy. "If you can find 
suitable housing, it is generally in a low-income neighborhood, where a lot of 
disabled people don't want to live because it is not as safe." 
</P>
<P>
According to the state Department of Rehabilitation, roughly 10% of the 
population in Los Angeles County is disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the department in 1981 -- the most current available -- 
show there were about 530,120 disabled persons between the ages of 16 and 64 in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Their disabilities run the gamut from physical problems -- such as paralysis, 
blindness, deafness and heart problems -- to mental retardation, drug and 
alcohol abuse, and emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Of those roughly half-million people, 387,240 of them were considered severely 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no figures for the San Fernando Valley, Department of 
Rehabilitation statistical researcher Dennis Bryan estimates that 10% of the 
Valley population is disabled. Urban areas, he said, tend to have the highest 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
No statistics were available on how much disabled-accessible housing exists. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a housing shortage for some time," Neal said. "There just isn't 
any new construction of accessible housing for the disabled. Older units are 
not accessible either." 
</P>
<P>
Although state and federal laws mandate that public buildings be accessible to 
the disabled, there is surprisingly little legislation to require that builders 
provide for special needs in dwellings, said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
And what regulations exist are weak and difficult to enforce, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has no building codes that specifically govern accessibility for 
dwellings. It relies on inadequate state regulations from the Department of 
Housing and Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
These regulations only cover apartment buildings of five or more units -- which 
leaves out condominiums and single-family residences -- and are difficult to 
enforce. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has been doing more to make sure there are more accessible units," 
says Dave Lara of the Department of Building and Safety, Disabled Access 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
New state codes have tightened requirements for privately funded apartments 
with five or more units built after Jan. 1. A cost limit that required builders 
to spend up to $774 per adaptable unit to make an apartment accessible was 
repealed in favor of stronger standards requiring that one unit for each 20 
units be fully accessible in a building of five or more units. Other units that 
are considered wheelchair-accessible because they have ramps or elevators 
leading to them must be partially accessible inside, meaning doorways and at 
least one bathroom must be wide enough for wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
Adaptable units must have 13 specified features, such as proper wall backing to 
support a grab bar in the bathroom or levers instead of knobs on inside doors. 
Builders must also make sure that if there is an elevator, the entrance to it 
is accessible, and that there is an adequate "path of travel" to adaptable 
units. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are still exemptions and because the regulations are still new, 
they are still being interpreted, according to Ron Skarin, principal building 
inspector in the city's Disabled Access Division. For example, if the first 
story of a building is 6 feet above or 4 feet below ground level and there is 
no elevator or ramp, the entire building is exempt because the apartments are 
considered inaccessible. The rules also do not apply to townhouse-type 
dwellings, where there is more than one floor and no elevator, ramp or lift, or 
to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Lara said that although the number of housing complaints has risen -- mostly 
because the disabled know there is a special section to deal with access 
problems -- the housing situation in Los Angeles is improving. 
</P>
<P>
"Builders are becoming more aware," Lara said. "The city is not unsympathetic 
to the plight of the builder who puts a lot of money into construction only to 
find out at the site from an inspector that he didn't meet some requirement or 
another. For the builders, this is just another of many city regulations they 
have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
The federal government is trying to help as well. The Housing Act of 1988 
prohibits discrimination against the disabled and strengthens enforcement of 
housing laws at the federal level. The Americans with Disabilities Act, which 
has passed the Senate and is awaiting action in the House, does not deal 
directly with housing, but does ensure handicapped access on public 
transportation and at other public places, such as businesses and movie 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley is "no better, no worse" than other areas of the city, according to 
Betty Wilson, director of the mayor's Office for the Disabled. The Valley may 
be "a little better in some instances," she said, "because there are new 
developments where you are more likely to find more accessibility, but not 
often affordability." 
</P>
<P>
"Adaptable, accessible housing -- that is the key," Wilson said. "That means 
anyone can use it comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
But having accessible housing oneself is not enough, Smith noted. 
</P>
<P>
"When the law says three or four apartments per 100 have to be accessible, that 
means I can get in my home, but I can't always get in yours," he explained. "If 
I come to your house to play bridge, maybe I can't use the bathroom. Or maybe I 
can't go from your living room to the den. So I am forced to stay in my own 
home. That is probably the saddest aspect. Why do you need that front step in 
front of your door? It's just been built into our design structure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of public awareness and political awareness to require these 
features, not only for the disabled, but for much of the population," said 
Smith. "Buildings should be made to these standards. We're doing things wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, model homes were unveiled in Calabasas that were proudly touted as 
being especially "child-safe" because they had such built-in safety features as 
electrical outlets with covers and two sets of stair handrails -- a big 
standard one for mom and dad, a lower one for the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
If houses can be adapted for children, why not for the disabled? Part of the 
problem is just awareness, experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Neal, it is lack of education among builders and architects that 
is the biggest problem. "Legislators are also not sensitized to the issues," 
she said." 
</P>
<P>
Smaller cities, such as Berkeley, Oakland and Glendale, are much better at 
enforcing state housing laws, Smith said, and move faster and further on this 
issue than Los Angeles can because "they don't have the logistical problems 
that L.A. does." 
</P>
<P>
In the grand scheme of things, Neal said, Los Angeles ranks in the top 
percentage of cities working to make life easier for their disabled citizens. 
"But it's relative to the whole problem," she noted. "Los Angeles is in the 
forefront, but there is still much to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, she said, is "the size and diversity of disabilities in 
Los Angeles. You can't make one rule that fits all of them." 
</P>
<P>
According to Neal, there are more disabled in Los Angeles than there are in the 
entire state -- and those statistics don't include senior citizens who have 
some of the same problems as the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, specialty organizations build their own housing, such as the 24-unit 
apartment building constructed by the Crippled Children's Foundation, or United 
Cerebral Palsy's three apartment buildings in Culver City, Torrance and 
Inglewood. Slack said the turnover rate for these units is very low -- maybe 
one apartment every four years becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, specialty organizations build their own housing, such as Rancho del 
Valle Apartments, the 24-unit apartment building recently constructed in Canoga 
Park by the Crippled Children's Foundation. Rancho del Valle, the newest of 
these units, is pretty much state of the art. Completed just before Christmas, 
the two-story security building has no steps to hamper a wheelchair, extra-wide 
doorways, low sinks and counters, bathrooms designed so that tenants can wheel 
themselves into the showers, and two emergency buttons in strategic locations. 
</P>
<P>
Built on land donated in 1953 by the Gold Diggers, a charitable women's group, 
the complex was built with $1.5 million in federal HUD funds and another 
$400,000 from the city's Community Redevelopment Agency and the Community 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the apartment units, the seven-acre complex has an indoor swimming pool 
used for recreation and therapy and buildings for vocational training and 
social events. 
</P>
<P>
The organization owns similar units in Glendale and Pasadena and is planning a 
40-unit complex in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of making housing accessible is not really a factor in new 
construction, most experts agreed. It does not cost that much more when 
building a dwelling to make doors wider, to use ramps instead of steps or to 
plan a bathroom with a wheelchair in mind. But it can be expensive to retrofit 
an existing home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cheaper to build them right in the first place," Smith said. "They are 
extremely costly to retrofit." 
</P>
<P>
Norma Vascova of the Independent Living Center in Van Nuys said that if a 
disabled person wants to rent a unit, "Some builders are adaptive; they will 
make adjustments." However, she said there is a catch because the "person can't 
get in to see it to see if he wants to rent it." 
</P>
<P>
"Accessible housing affects more than the disabled," said Smith. "It also 
affects senior citizens. What happens to seniors when they can't live in their 
homes anymore? There is a huge need for this type of construction. There is a 
huge part of the population that needs single-story homes, as well as 
apartments and condos. 
</P>
<P>
"But developers say land value is too high to build single-story homes; that 
people want so much in a house, you have to build two stories to get it. It 
takes less imagination to build a two-story house." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said accessible housing needs to begin in the minds of the architects, 
who he said "are not sensitized to the problem. They need to be educated." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been said," Wilson commented, "that if Frank Lloyd Wright had been 
disabled, we would have beautiful ramps in buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said activists have been trying to educate developers through seminars 
and information sessions and have been working with the attorney general's 
office to develop tougher laws and guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
What's sad, he said, is that "it requires very minor changes to make housing 
accessible." 
</P>
<P>
"We've made substantial progress," Smith said. "But the span of issues is so 
large that every day there is a new frontier of problems to address."

All Dressed Up 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even carry pants for little girls anymore -- they won't wear them. 
They all want to wear dresses now, and the more roses and bows and lace the 
better," said Kathy Kahn, owner of The Little Prints, a children's clothing 
store in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Two-year-old Olivia Korenberg of Sherman Oaks refuses to wear pants, although 
her 4-year-old sister Emilie will sometimes wear them. "They say pants are for 
boys," said their mother, Francoise Korenberg. "We dance a lot and they like 
the way the dress turns when they turn." 
</P>
<P>
Some little girls love dresses so much that they wear two of them 
simultaneously. "We see a lot of little girls layer their cotton knit summer 
dresses," said Cassie Thompson, general manager of The Chocolate Giraffe, a 
children's clothing store in Encino. "They wear a sleeveless one over one with 
short sleeves, then use a T-shirt ring to bunch up the top one so you can see 
the other one underneath." 
</P>
<P>
Another popular summer look for little girls is skeggings -- bicycle-type 
shorts with a skirt sewn over them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than 31 Flavors 
</P>
<P>
Her job is to eat ice cream every day, sometimes as much as half a gallon. "I'm 
forever buying ice cream at the supermarket, I'm forever going to competitors' 
stores to see what flavors they have and I have samples sent to me from all 
around the country when someone in another region introduces a new flavor," 
said Carol Kirby, vice president of Baskin-Robbins USA Co., the ice cream 
manufacturer with more than 2,250 franchises nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are about average in their ice-cream consumption, she said. "The 
highest per-capita is in New England, although you'd think it would be warmer 
places," Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1946, Baskin-Robbins has introduced more than 650 flavors, and the 
formulas and flavor essences of each are stored in the "flavor library" at the 
company's Burbank headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kirby, pralines 'n' cream is the company's biggest seller. "As far 
as flavors that didn't seem to appeal to anyone, there was date ice cream, or 
pistachio ice cream that wasn't green, or ice cream with pears in it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some flavors that aren't successful in the United States do very well overseas, 
such as mango, kiwi and papaya ice creams, which are popular in Southeast Asia 
and Japan. Red bean, sweet corn and green tea ice creams have all be 
specifically developed for Japan. "We didn't even try to mass market them 
here," Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
Other flavors make comebacks, such as peanut butter and jelly ice cream. "It 
didn't do very well about 10 or 15 years ago, but it's very popular right now," 
Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Big-Buck Trucks 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine spending $100,000 for a truck and not even taking it for a test 
drive? "It's not necessary," said Tom Roch of Sun Valley, who has been selling 
trucks for 35 years. He now sells Peterbilts at Engs Motor Truck Co. in Pico 
Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
"Just driving a truck tractor around the block, you're not going to learn 
anything. You have to carry a trailer and a load to know what it's going to do, 
so we rarely go out on test drives. Well, with new people you have to do it 
occasionally," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Today's top-of-the-line trucks resemble compact RVs. "They have sleeping 
compartments with refrigerators and microwaves. Some have bunk beds that are 
full-sized twins. And television is very common in a sleeper today," Roch said. 
"They have sinks with running water. Some have their own auxiliary power system 
so that when they're parked they can have electricity other than from the 
batteries. And they've got CD players with high-quality speakers." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are those glorious lights. "It's up to each individual's taste. Some 
love to load them up with lights so they look like a Christmas tree coming down 
the highway," Roch said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterbilt trucks are the No. 1 seller in this area, according to Roch, although 
nationally they are in roughly fifth place. When asked if he owned a Peterbilt, 
Roch replied, "Oh, heavens no! But they are fun to drive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creative Visualizations 
</P>
<P>
Picture yourself sitting alone on a beach, enveloped in radiant sunlight, lost 
in the sound of the surf, your feet snuggled into the warm sand. Are you there 
yet? 
</P>
<P>
Every Wednesday from 7 to 8:30 p.m., cancer patients from around the Valley 
meet, along with their spouses and family members, in a room at AMI Tarzana 
Regional Medical Center to listen to this and other relaxing scenes being 
described to them by Marilyn Stolzman, Ph.D., a psychotherapist with a private 
practice in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Cancer Support through Creative Visualization," the free weekly 
counseling group is "an add-on that patients can do for themselves in 
conjunction with prescribed medical treatment. You use the picture-creating 
part of your mind -- the right brain -- to create positive images to move you 
in a positive direction," Stolzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Patients are encouraged to repeat mental exercises daily to help them manage 
stress and to even help control nausea. 
</P>
<P>
The group is sponsored by the Burbank-based Hematology, Oncology, Palliation 
Education Foundation and the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Lyons of Canoga Park, a frequent participant, was diagnosed as having 
breast cancer a year ago. "I often feel out of control, and this group helps me 
feel more in control," she said. Lyons is accompanied by her husband, Harry, 
who uses the techniques to help him with his heart ailments.

Antelope Valley aviation fans simply call it "the corner." 
</P>
<P>
On a good day they might see some of the newest and most secret aircraft in the 
world as they look east from Sierra Highway and Avenue N in Palmdale into the 
Air Force's Plant 42. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Stebbens, 33, a dishwasher for a local hospital, says he's seen the B-2 
Stealth bomber, the B-1 and the SR-71 "Blackbird," which was retired from 
service recently. Stebbens said he tries to observe the Air Force base at least 
three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Another regular, Bjorn Engstrom, 40, of Palmdale, said he likes to start his 
day at the corner, where up to 100 others might be taking in the sights. "Many 
times I stop out here at 7 a.m. with my coffee and newspaper," he said while 
pointing out the underside of an Air Force jet to his son, Erik, 9. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can, I'll stop by at lunchtime again and maybe a quick five or 10 minutes 
in the afternoon. It's kind of a hobby to just come by and watch the airplanes. 
There's been quite a few friendships built out on this corner," Engstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the cab of his truck, local resident John McWhirter is equipped with 
a chattering CB, a radio scanner spitting out aircraft call signs and a cooler 
filled with drinks. "We're all airplane buffs and it doesn't cost us anything," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Larsen, 47, of Quartz Hill brought his son, Jason, 11, and daughter Gail, 
21, out for an afternoon of sun and airplane watching. "It's great to come out 
and watch what the planes do," Gail said. 
</P>
<P>
Mixed in with the regulars are first-timers such as Palmdale resident Joe 
Tyson, 31, who brought his wife, Andrea, and two children to see the show. 
"It's neat," he said with a grin. "I plan to come back." 
</P>
<P>
"I love to watch the airplanes," said Tom Engblom, 43, a Lancaster construction 
worker who has been a regular since 1987. DAVID LUSTIG

On April 4, 1989, members of the Lake View Terrace community and 
representatives from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers met to discuss the future 
of the recreation center and Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers, which owns the property, agreed with residents that a 
man-made lake would best serve the community. Preliminary plans are to build a 
lake in the dam area sometime before the year 2000. The lake is tentatively 
planned for the basin area next to a section of picnic tables and trees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the San Fernando Valley Fair moved from Devonshire Downs in 
Northridge to Hansen Dam in 1989. The fair committee plans to host a larger and 
longer fair at Hansen Dam again this year. KAREN KINGSBURY

A museum planning to exhibit sexually explicit photographs by the late Robert 
Mapplethorpe has taken the unusual step of asking a court to decide whether 
they violate local obscenity laws. 
</P>
<P>
The private Contemporary Arts Center hopes to forestall the sheriff's threat to 
file obscenity charges against the museum when it opens the six-week exhibit 
April 6. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Simon Leis, a veteran anti-smut campaigner, has called some of the 
pictures "criminally obscene" and said he will take action against the exhibit 
if police do not. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the photographs in the show depict homosexual activity and 
sadomasochistic sex acts. The pictures led Congress last year to limit federal 
support for the arts after Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) labeled them obscene. 
</P>
<P>
The museum Tuesday filed a petition for a jury trial in Municipal Court. A 
trial date was not immediately set. Museum officials said they expected a 
ruling before the exhibit opens. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be unorthodox for the person displaying the material to initiate this 
action, but in this case it is the common-sense thing to do," said Marc 
Mezibov, a lawyer for the museum.

COMPELLING DRAMA OF HIROSHIMA SURVIVORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shohei Imamura's "Black Rain" (at the Westside Pavilion) -- not to be confused 
with the recent Ridley Scott set-in-Japan action-thriller -- takes its title 
from a phenomenon that occurred in the aftermath of the atomic bombing of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Moisture in the air, permeated by radioactive ash, 
condensed into rain and fell in dark, lethal drops. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the the matter is the psychological torment of those who must live 
with the uncertain, unpredictable nature of having been exposed to such 
radioactive fallout. They worry for themselves and for each other; they are 
terror-struck by merely feeling under the weather. Imamura makes palpable the 
agony of living with the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Black Rain," which was shot appropriately in black-and-white and has a 
discreet Toru Takemitsu score, is of course implicitly an anti-nuclear protest 
and a very strong one at that. But it also a protest of discrimination against 
the atomic bomb survivors, who number today approximately 370,OO0, and it 
furthermore belongs to a large group of Japanese films concerned with exposing 
the terrible price exacted of ordinary citizens by World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a 1969 novel drawn from diaries and interviews with actual Hiroshima 
survivors, "Black Rain" opens in the immediate aftermath of the bombing of 
Hiroshima and tells the story of a family of survivors, a middle-aged couple, 
Shigematsu and Shigeko Shizuma (Kazuo Kitamura, Etsuko Ichihara) and their 
niece Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka). Only the aunt and uncle actually were in 
Hiroshima at the time of the bombing, although Yasuko was exposed to the black 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the major films of Imamura, one of the most distinctive and powerful 
filmmakers in the world, "Black Rain" is the most conventional, perhaps because 
of the enormity of the catastrophe with which he is trying to come to terms. It 
is in fact a tribute to his ability to compel us that his film recovers and 
develops a timeless sense of urgency from what seems a major miscalculation at 
its start. For instead of relying upon archival footage, Imamura re-creates the 
immediate after-effects of the bombing upon the citizens of Hiroshima, with 
scores of people wandering about with their flesh literally melting like wax. 
Their hideous wounds, however, are patently fake yet so horrible as for us to 
resist suspending disbelief -- we're relieved and glad to be able to realize 
that it's all just make-up. As a result, it takes a considerable amount of time 
to get caught up in the story -- to accept its reality in all its 
relentlessness. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, Imamura's abiding preoccupation, which is obsessive 
behavior, comes into play. The Shizumas commence resuming a semblance of normal 
existence at the country estate of the uncle, a wealthy landowner and the 
dominant figure in a small, idyllic-looking rural community. All three seem 
perfectly healthy, and they look forward happily to Yasuko's imminent arranged 
marriage. But when the engagement is broken off -- Yasuko's prospective in-laws 
fear she really is not healthy -- a heartbreaking pattern is set in motion, for 
Yasuko discovers she is permanently stigmatized by her exposure to the black 
rain. Meanwhile, the Shizumas and their neighbors are learning that the atom 
bomb has in effect set off within all exposed to it a time bomb in the form of 
radiation sickness. 
</P>
<P>
Imamura is most effective at getting his actors to suggest what it is like to 
confront and live with an enduring, slowly-consuming sense of horror. By the 
time "Black Rain" (Times-rated Mature) is over its impact is akin to that of 
Lynne Littman's galvanic nuclear holocaust drama "Testament."

STAGE WATCH: AIDS DRAMA AT COMEDY STORE PLAYHOUSE; STARS PAIRED FOR PASADENA 
'LOVE LETTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To paraphrase Stephen Sondheim, it's "comedy tomorrow, tragedy tonight." 
</P>
<P>
That could be the motto for the new Comedy Store Playhouse, which will open its 
doors with the landmark AIDS drama, "As Is." 
</P>
<P>
When the Comedy Store took over, refurbished and re-named the former Hollywood 
Playhouse in 1988, it was announced that the 246-seat theater on Las Palmas 
would be a forum for comedies and comics' solo shows. 
</P>
<P>
"As Is" does not fall into either category. "It does have a lot of comedy in 
it, but I wouldn't say it's a comedy," acknowledged its co-producer Libby 
Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
Comedy will still be a priority at the theater, said a spokesman for Comedy 
Store owner Mitzi Shore. In fact, the auditorium itself (as opposed to the 
entire structure, which also includes studio and restaurant space) will be 
named after comedian Richard Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
But Shore "felt the subject matter (of 'As Is') was important." And "getting 
the place open with a good play was the important thing," said the spokesman. 
The theater has been dark since a production of "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and 
Grill" in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"As Is" is being produced by Nicholson and Dan Millington, who also mounted it 
at the South Orange County Community Theater in Laguna Beach, Jan. 18-Feb. 10. 
Its Hollywood run will be a non-Equity production -- though Nicholson said the 
actors will be paid $50 per performance. At least 10% of the gross will be 
assigned to organizations fighting AIDS or supporting people with AIDS. Free 
valet parking will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
'LETTER'-WRITERS: Carol Burnett and Leslie Nielsen are among the couples cast 
in A.R. Gurney's "Love Letters" at the 384-seat Canon Theatre. The casting, 
which will change weekly, continues in the starry tradition established in New 
York and at the warm-up production that's playing in the 121-seat Balcony 
Theatre at the Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The couples: 
</P>
<P>
Christine Lahti and Treat Williams (April 17-22), Michael Learned and Ned 
Beatty (April 24-29), Meredith Baxter Birney and Richard Thomas (May 1-6), 
Julie Hagerty and Christopher Reeve (May 8-13), Helen Hunt and Matthew 
Broderick (May 15-20), To Be Announced (May 22-27), Burnett and Nielsen (May 
29-June 3), and more of the dynamic To Be Announced (June 5-10). 
</P>
<P>
99-SEAT NAME GAME: Two weeks ago Stage Watch asked readers for a new name to 
replace the dated term "Equity Waiver." Although the old Equity Waiver system 
was replaced by Actors' Equity's 99-Seat Theater Plan in October, 1988, the old 
phrase is still used in press releases, interviews and conversations, as 
shorthand for Equity-sanctioned productions in theaters of fewer than 100 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
"Equity 99" was submitted by Ken Stone of Glendale. "It lets us all get halfway 
through saying 'Equity Waiver' and still make a graceful, undetected recovery," 
wrote Stone. 
</P>
<P>
"Mini Equity" or "MinEquity," suggested Jim Buckley, artistic director of the 
Pewter Plough Playhouse in Cambria. 
</P>
<P>
"Equity W" or "Equity double-U," offered Robert W. King of Redlands, who 
explained that it "derives from "Equity Undersize, Understanding . . . 
undersize to describe the capacity . . . understanding refers to the type of 
agreement with the union." 
</P>
<P>
"Small professional," wrote Al Rossi of Van Nuys, who nevertheless acknowledged 
that there might be some confusion between this and Equity's existing Small 
Professional Theatre contract, which is sometimes used in theaters with more 
than 99 seats. 
</P>
<P>
HEAR, HEAR: An infrared listening system has been installed in the three 
largest theaters at Los Angeles Theatre Center. Hearing-impaired spectators 
will be able to rent headsets in the lobby, beginning April 4. 
</P>
<P>
The system is courtesy of a $25,000 contribution from Prudential-Bache 
Securities, Inc. The grant also will provide for sign language interpreters at 
some of LATC'S "Theatre as a Learning Tool" performances. 
</P>
<P>
HEAT ON AT FONDA: "Hollywood's Hottest New Night Spot!!" proclaimed the ad, 
along with announcements of four rock shows and a jazz concert. The venue? 
</P>
<P>
The Henry Fonda Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that the theater will no longer present theater? 
</P>
<P>
Not at all, replied Stan Seiden, president of James Nederlander Companies, 
operators of the Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've run an ad like that," he acknowledged, "because 
we have two or three (actually, five) shows in a row (April 12-June 1)." But 
the concerts are "just to fill in time" in an otherwise dark theater. And this 
isn't a new policy -- "we've done a few small rock shows there from time to 
time." The last he recalled was "maybe 6 to 8 months ago." 
</P>
<P>
As for plays at the Fonda, a Los Angeles Playgoers series of bookings is being 
assembled, said Seiden, and should be ready to announce within several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
CALFEST: South Coast Repertory's second annual California Play Festival 
(CalFest) will include full productions of Octavio Solis' "Man of the Flesh" 
May 4-20 and Shem Bitterman's "The Ramp" May 15-June 3, on the theater's Second 
Stage. Four plays will receive staged readings.

JAPANESE KODO DRUMMERS PERFORM AT ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sado Island in the Sea of Japan is not the birthplace of sadomasochism -- but 
you begin to wonder when you see the island's most famous export: Kodo, "the 
children of the drum." 
</P>
<P>
Playing from the most excruciating positions imaginable -- in a low 
squat-stance ("Miyake"), for example, or in a lay-back ("Yatai Bayashi"), so 
that each drumbeat requires a sit-up -- this 12-man, communal company aims for 
the absolute in force, precision, stamina, teamwork and self-abnegation. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Yoshikazu Fujimoto attack the 800-pound O-daiko high on a platform at 
Royce Hall on Tuesday, you saw each rib, every ligament, all his vertebrae 
under skin stretched so taut that he might have been a drum himself. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly this was not just a performance, not "merely" drumming, but some sort 
of engulfing, metaphysical test. And thus the burst of playful celebration (and 
individuality) in the finale seemed like a frat-house party after finals -- or 
whatever 20th-Century samurai do after proving themselves worthy. 
</P>
<P>
With its low, steady tattoos rising inexorably to a roaring storm, Maki Ishii's 
"Monochrome" again proved Kodo's most intimidating showpiece. Sometimes the 
seven players produced a light clatter like distant typewriters from their 
small drums. In other passages, their unison playing mixed with the throb of a 
gong and pounding assaults on big drums -- or splintered into brilliantly 
coordinated irregular rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Roetsu Tosha's "Chonlima" also offered relentless drum crescendos, along with 
motifs passed down a line of four drummers and punctuated by statements from a 
single large drum behind them. Like "Monochrome," there were no solos here -- 
but the fierce, punishing hammer-blow solos in "Miyake" by Eiichi Saito and, 
especially, Tatsuro Matsuzaki demonstrated individual mastery far less than a 
kind of unsparing selflessness. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, Kodo has broadened its repertory to embrace idioms far different than 
such scorched-earth Japanese specialties. "Yu-Karak" (new to UCLA) adapted 
Korean farmers' music -- Samul-Nori turf -- for a relatively relaxed and 
spontaneous display led by the highly personable Leonard Mitsutada Eto. 
Composed by Eto, the piece featured two drummers playing a simple, one-stick 
pattern, two others making complex figures with two sticks and Eto himself 
using two sticks and two sides of his drum for maximum virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kodo's methodical style in the new "Ryogen-no-hi" robbed Javanese 
gamelan playing of its sensuality (no cascades of bells; indeed, very few 
overtones), the contemplative flute and samisen interludes by Motohumi 
Yamaguchi and Yasukazu Kano showed that the company can excel at something 
other than drums and cymbals. 
</P>
<P>
Performances continue through Sunday afternoon and mark the end of Kodo's 
10-week "One Earth" tour of the United States.

EARLIER CLASSES, STAFF AND BUS SERVICE CUTS PROPOSED FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some students would face a 7:15 a.m. school bell next year, and all juniors 
would be required to take physical education classes if the Long Beach school 
board approves budget cuts proposed this week. 
</P>
<P>
Officials suggested that the start of school be moved up at least 35 minutes to 
7:15 a.m. for some students to cut down on the number of school buses needed to 
take children to school. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also estimated that they would save as much as $400,000 by requiring 
juniors to take physical education classes, which can accommodate larger 
numbers of students. "By the very nature of a P.E. class, it's twice the size 
of a normal class," said district Controller Tomio Nishimura. "That's one less 
class we have to conduct for 11th grade." Physical education is mandatory for 
9th and 10th graders. 
</P>
<P>
The school board is considering these and other proposed cuts to balance the 
district's budget, estimated at $350 million, for the 1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have submitted a package of cuts totaling $16.5 million. The 
board would have to eliminate $11.5 million to balance the budget, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several management and clerical positions also would be eliminated, the overall 
maintenance budget would be cut 5%, and new equipment purchases would be 
frozen. About 75 custodial workers would be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
School bus service would be eliminated for 641 students, and the average class 
size would be increased by one student to 31 at all schools. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes a proposal to eliminate a music program in the elementary 
schools, but several board members said last week that they don't expect to 
touch any music programs. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest changes for students and teachers would have those in 
secondary schools setting their alarm clocks earlier, while those in elementary 
schools would start their day 40 minutes later. The changes would allow school 
buses to make three runs, instead of two, saving the district $800,000, 
according to transportation director Richard Cassman. 
</P>
<P>
Other transportation changes include eliminating bus service for 500 elementary 
students and 141 Jordan High School students, which would save $250,000, 
Nishimura said. Those students were allowed to ride the bus because of special 
circumstances, he said, but many of those circumstances no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
At Kettering Elementary School, for example, 35 students get bus rides because 
officials were concerned about students' walking across 7th Street. Students 
can now get around the busy street by walking on a bridge crossing at 
Studebaker Road, Nishimura said. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary students generally are eligible for bus service if they live more 
than 1.5 miles from school. The distance increases to three miles for high 
school students, Nishimura said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say budget cuts are necessary because the Long Beach Unified 
School District has been dipping into its reserves for years, and can no longer 
afford to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The district's reserves have declined from $29.1 million in the 1986-87 school 
year to an estimated $12.8 million this year. "The district cannot continue 
this pattern of deficit spending," Nishimura wrote in a report to the board.

SANTA MONICA: A CITY REPORT THAT PRAISES RENT CONTROL DRAWS FIRE. ONE ADVOCATE

Some landlords and advocates of low-cost housing complained at a City Council 
hearing that a state-mandated update of Santa Monica's housing regulations and 
policies neglected to look into the effects of rent control and other 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Santa Monica's housing programs are comprehensive and 
address most of the city's major needs. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff performed a technical update of housing stock, saying that until 
new census data is tabulated it will be difficult to thoroughly understand 
changes taking place in the city and the resulting needs. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday night delayed action on the report for at least one 
week after Mayor Dennis Zane became ill and had to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the speakers at Tuesday's public hearing on the update, particularly 
landlords, used the opportunity to once again attack the city's rent control 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the programs I can wholeheartedly support," said landlord Donna 
Alvarez, "but others are a complete disaster. The study says rent control is 
working. It's not working." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez and other landlords blamed rent control for a decrease in the number of 
housing units and warned that it would also discourage construction of rental 
units in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords also criticized a proposal that would require all construction of 
three units or more to set aside 30% of the units for low- and moderate-income 
people or pay an in-lieu fee of $22 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
The city currently requires new construction of five units or more to set aside 
15% of the units for low- and moderate-income people or pay an in-lieu fee of 
$6.50 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Chris Harding, who represents landlords and developers, said increases 
are not justified and represent further obstacles for the development of new 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
"The fees will shut down housing development in the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lambert, a developer and landlord, said the city's insistence on trying to 
get developers to fund low-cost housing will backfire. 
</P>
<P>
"Landlords are just going to continue to 'Ellis' their buildings rather than 
continue to pay higher fees," he said, referring to the state Ellis Act, which 
allows landlords to legally evict all tenants and get out of the rental 
business. "It just doesn't make economic sense." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Ellis Act went into effect in 1986, owners of more 1,000 units in 
Santa Monica have notified the city they plan to get out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Not only landlords criticized the report. Paul Rosenstein, a rent control 
supporter, called the report vague, saying that he had hoped it would deal with 
more issues and provide more specific solutions to the city's housing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Among the findings of the update: 
</P>
<P>
* The city's 1989 population is estimated at 96,461, up from 88,314 in 1980, an 
increase of about 9%. 
</P>
<P>
* The average household size increased from 1.97 in 1980 to 2.08 in 1988, which 
is still lower than the countywide average of 2.83. 
</P>
<P>
* Multifamily housing units made up 76.8% of the city's housing stock in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* There are an estimated 2,327 substandard housing units, 514 of which cannot 
be rehabilitated and should be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
* Based on Southern California Assn. of Government estimates, the city needs 
3,220 new housing units by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommended policies: 
</P>
<P>
* Land should be purchased and held until financing is available to develop 
low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
* The conversion of residential properties to non-residential uses should be 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
* A program should be developed that would allow developers to build more units 
than code allows if a percentage of units are set aside for low- and 
moderate-income people.

COUNCIL BLOCKS BID TO OUST MANAGER IN MONTEREY PARK

<P>
Council members blocked attempts Monday by Councilman Barry Hatch to oust City 
Manager Mark Lewis and to challenge Lewis' selection for interim police chief. 
</P>
<P>
"I give him a 100% vote of confidence," Councilwoman Betty Couch said in 
defense of Lewis, whom Hatch has blamed for the March 13 resignation of Police 
Chief Ken Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hickman's replacement, interim Chief Robert Collins, 66, was briefly 
caught in the political dispute between Hatch and Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch has criticized Lewis' selection of Collins, noting that the interim chief 
has been awarded $15,000 in disability pay for a heart problem. Hatch said he 
fears that the city would be liable for additional workers' compensation 
payments if Collins, who retired as chief in 1989, were to suffer other heart 
problems while serving as interim chief. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who waived his right to a closed session discussion about his fitness 
to serve, told the council Monday that doctors had cleared him for work. At 
Lewis' invitation, an attorney specializing in workers' compensation law also 
assured the council that putting Collins back on the payroll would not create 
additional liabilities for the city. 
</P>
<P>
When Hatch dropped the matter, Lewis smiled at Collins, and said: "Chief, 
welcome back." 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's meeting, Hatch also failed to round up council support to back 
his demand that Lewis resign. Hatch has accused the city manager of financial 
mismanagement and abuse of authority in connection with Hickman's abrupt 
departure as police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman, a former Los Angeles Police Department commander hired just a year 
ago, announced his resignation after the Monterey Park Police Officers Assn. 
gave him with a no confidence vote. Wes Clair, president of the police 
association, said officers were unhappy with Hickman's policy changes that 
restricted overtime, promotions and work schedule choices. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch has blamed Lewis for undermining Hickman's authority, which he said 
prompted the chief to resign. Among other allegations, Hatch also accused Lewis 
of overspending in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday night, three council members defended Lewis and threw their support 
behind him. Couch read into the record sections of a letter Lewis drafted in 
response to Hatch's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the city manager denied Hatch's charges and noted that so far in 
the current fiscal year, the Police Department has spent less than its budget 
allocation. In February, with 67% of the fiscal year past, the police 
department had spent 63.5% of its $7 million-plus budget, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pat Reichenberger and Councilwoman Judy Chu also praised Lewis and said 
he has their support. Chu said the attacks against Lewis were unjustified and 
described them as "someone's personal political vendetta." Hatch denied any 
personal or political motivation. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Chris Houseman, who did not speak about Lewis' performance during 
the meeting, said afterward that he had no comment. Houseman said he believes 
any discussion about Lewis' work is a personnel matter and should have been 
discussed in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch last week attempted to mobilize a citizens committee to pressure council 
to oust Lewis, but on Monday, most speakers seemed to side with the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate move, Hatch proposed that the city authorize an independent audit 
of city finances. But Couch and Chu, joined by some residents, said the city 
already pays for an annual audit so an additional one would be redundant. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that he again lacked council support, Hatch chose not to call for 
a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch said he will continue to push for Lewis' resignation and criticized his 
fellow council members as "totally irresponsible for not supporting me on an 
independent audit."

STAMPING OUT SMOKING; 
</P>
<P>
WITH $1 MILLION TO SPEND, COALITION TO PLOT ANTI-CIGARETTE CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Long Beach health officials are exploring ways of spending the city's share of 
tobacco tax money -- $1 million -- in an ambitious statewide effort to cut 
cigarette smoking by 75% by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of more than two dozen local experts will meet for the first time 
next week to discuss strategies for the new tax money approved by voters more 
than a year ago, the first ever allocated for education to stop an addiction 
blamed for nearly one-third of the nation's cancer deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The money is the product of Proposition 99, which raised the tax on cigarettes 
25 cents a pack and imposed similar increases on pipe, cigar and other tobacco 
products. 
</P>
<P>
The tax generated $1.5 billion statewide, and just more than $1 million of it 
has trickled down to the Health Department and school district in Long Beach -- 
a city with a sizable population of minorities and children considered at "high 
risk" of tobacco addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Local health experts say they have their work cut out for them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very large community and it is a very diverse community with lots of 
populations at risk for using tobacco products," said Alan Henderson, chairman 
of the health sciences department at Cal State Long Beach. "This is money 
earmarked for education that has not been here before, and a lot can be done 
with that amount of money for the benefit of the people in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
But officials concede that the local money pales next to the $2.5 billion the 
tobacco industry spends on national advertising yearly, much of it, they say, 
aimed at minorities and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
A recent cigarette called Uptown was pulled off the market by its manufacturers 
after health advocates decried a marketing campaign that clearly targeted 
blacks, who suffer one of the highest lung cancer death rates in the country, 
cancer experts report. 
</P>
<P>
And health officials have long complained that cigarette packaging and ad 
images are seductive to children, 70% of whom will try tobacco at some point, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the dramatic need for education, this is not a lot of money -- a 
drop in the bucket -- and it is very important that it be spent wisely by 
someone who can deliver," said Jayne Lastusky, executive director of the 
American Cancer Society's Long Beach unit and a coalition member. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition also will include representatives from the American Heart Assn., 
area hospitals, public schools and Cal State Long Beach. It will monitor the 
spending of $632,000 administered by the Long Beach Department of Health and 
Human Services and $408,000 by the Long Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Most cities in Los Angeles County are served by the county's massive health 
department. Because Long Beach is one of only three communities that operates 
its own health agency, it has the unique opportunity to fight tobacco on the 
local level. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said it is vital that education go "beyond pamphlets." The coalition 
will attempt to define the tobacco problem in Long Beach, determine how to stop 
those who have started and educate those who have not. 
</P>
<P>
Experts hope to see the money used to enhance programs like Smoke-Free 2000, 
aimed at educating first-graders to ensure that they will be nonsmokers when 
they enter high school. Another concept is a hot line with information about 
stop-smoking programs for schools, industries and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The funds became available in January and the health department hired 
consultant Judy Ross to direct the tobacco control program last month. Already, 
though, there is concern that Long Beach has fallen behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
While the coalition approaches its first meeting Wednesday, the state is 
already preparing to launch an anti-tobacco media blitz April 11. Competition 
will be stiff for millions more dollars available to agencies by request, and 
Long Beach could miss out if its plans are not firmed up soon, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned Long Beach is behind," he said. "This is more money than has 
been seen in a long, long time for health educators. And there is a lot of 
excitement among people in health education who have been toiling in the 
vineyards without any resources for so long."

'MACHO SCHOOL' HAS NEW LEADER AND PERHAPS NEW IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA FARRINGTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christine Wight knows her college has a reputation for being a "macho school." 
</P>
<P>
But she's hoping that her election as Claremont McKenna College's first woman 
student body president will change all that. 
</P>
<P>
Wight, an economics major, won 54.2% of the 560 votes cast during elections 
last month at this small private college, formerly Claremont Men's College. 
Also elected Feb. 20 were three female class presidents: Ingrid Morris, 20, 
senior; Laura Lulejian , 20, junior, and Beth Curtis, 19, sophomore. The 
freshman class elects its officers in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes me really happy is that gender never came up in the election," said 
Wight, a 21-year-old junior. "I do think, though, that this will dispel some of 
the negative image that people have of the school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this school has gotten a bad rap for being a macho school. But the 
years that I've been here, I've never felt it, and I don't think it's true." 
</P>
<P>
Claremont McKenna, one of the six Claremont Colleges, was founded in 1946; it 
did not admit women until 1976. Wight said the school's image is based 
primarily on its past practice of excluding women. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate was very different then," agreed Yvette Rodick, a 1986 graduate 
who is now director of internship and community relations for the college. She 
also is adviser for the school's Women's Forum, an informal group that meets 
twice a month to discuss issues of concern to women. "The environment is much 
more supportive now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Ormseth, 31, was part of the first class to attend Claremont McKenna 
after it opened its doors to women. She said she will never forget what it was 
like to be one of 60 women in the midst of 751 men. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the first night I went to the dining hall for dinner," Ormseth 
recalled. "I sat down and looked around and I was the only woman in the hall 
surrounded by 300 men. . . . It was quite a feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"The school definitely had a masculine flavor to it," Ormseth continued. "They 
were not used to having women around. For example, there were no bathtubs in 
the school (dormitories), only group showers, which most women are not used 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Ormseth, now vice president of Union Bank's San Jose Real Estate Loan Center, 
said it would have been "unlikely for a woman to be student body president at 
that time." 
</P>
<P>
"Society has changed a lot since I've graduated, and the fact the school has 
chosen its first female president is a reflection of that change," Ormseth 
said. "Women, at that time, were still not fully accepted in positions of 
authority. . . . We were part of a changing era." 
</P>
<P>
The four newly elected presidents say they too are part of a changing era. "It 
has taken a long time before we reached this point, but progress takes time," 
Morris said. "It's finally here -- people are beginning to be judged as 
individuals, not as males or females." 
</P>
<P>
Lulejian agreed, saying: "We were not elected because we are women, but because 
we are qualified to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the election, though, students are quick to point out that sexism 
exists in society and on campus as well. 
</P>
<P>
Women are still under-represented at the college, known for its economics and 
government curricula. Women make up 37% of the 859-member student body. Last 
year, the school president appointed a six-member committee to look into sexism 
on campus, after an incident in which a paid stripper took off most of her 
clothes in a packed dining hall as a birthday present for one of the students. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been surveying students, faculty and staff to get their feelings on 
sexism on campus," said Rodick, who serves on the committee appointed by 
President Jack Stark. "We are still gathering data, but we do expect a report 
to be published in April. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really say if sexism exists or doesn't exist on campus," she said. 
"But the more we talk about it, the better it'll be for everyone."

COUNCIL CONSIDERS CONTROLLING GROWTH IN 25 'SUB-AREAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Glendale City Council members Tuesday abandoned a plan for a citywide curb on 
construction of new apartments. 
</P>
<P>
They said they will start limiting growth in individual neighborhoods instead. 
</P>
<P>
City planners said they have identified 25 so-called sub-areas of Glendale in 
which the council may want to apply new rules on building. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the city, they said, could still be considered under one zoning 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Council members told the planners to return April 24 with more specific 
suggestions for zoning changes in the 25 neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're heading in the right direction," Mayor Jerold F. Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been considering zoning changes to slow the city's population 
boom, which threatens to overcrowd schools, clog streets and overburden the 
sewer system. So-called downzoning would allow fewer housing units than are 
presently allowed on a lot. 
</P>
<P>
The city Planning Commission in February recommended blanket density cuts for 
new condominiums and apartments. But council members asked for more flexibility 
after hearing complaints from property owners. 
</P>
<P>
In the 25 sub-areas, planners may suggest that more new apartments be permitted 
if the neighborhood is already dominated by multifamily buildings. They also 
may urge that large apartment complexes be banned from neighborhoods that have 
mostly single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
The sub-areas, of varying sizes, were picked because of requests from property 
owners or because the current type of development there is homogeneous, said 
Principal Planner Jim Glaser. Sections of Glendale not within the 25 sub-areas 
would be governed by the blanket downzoning rules announced earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the selected areas, as a start, are very appropriate," Councilman Carl 
W. Raggio said. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director John W. McKenna said that at the April 24 meeting "we'll give 
the council various scenarios." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said the options will be aimed at allowing only 10,000 more housing 
units citywide -- the limit suggested by some council members. These homes 
would give the city about 30,000 new residents or a peak population of about 
230,000. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, council members continued to hear a mixture of praise and 
criticism from property owners about downzoning. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Brown, part owner of a site on South Adams Street, said he cannot sell 
his property if the council reduces the number of units that can be built on 
it. "This is a hardship case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donnalee Jackson said the value of her property near Columbus School "has 
dropped dramatically" because of the downzoning proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But other residents said the construction of inexpensive apartment complexes in 
Glendale must be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
"I support downzoning," Nancy Moure said. "I don't think we want to start a 
tenement city here." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Gregor also endorsed the growth curbs, saying, "It seems to me that 
overcrowding in the city is already evident. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who's lived here for 25 years and has been a property owner is not 
going to lose money."

EMISSARIES: AN EIGHT-MEMBER TROUPE, CHILDREN OF WAR, VISITS GLENDALE ON ITS 
TOUR TO ACQUAINT U.S. STUDENTS WITH THE CONFLICTS THAT TROUBLE MUCH OF THE

Justina Endjala, a shy 17-year-old from Namibia, had just finished telling of 
life in her West African homeland -- of police brutality, racial segregation, a 
century-old battle for independence. Rachel Richman, a white Glendale High 
School senior, was shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically know nothing about those countries," said Richman, 17. "It makes 
me mad that I don't know and that I'm not doing anything about it. But how are 
we supposed to relate to them if we're thinking, 'Am I going to get a car for 
my 16th birthday?' " 
</P>
<P>
For Endjala and seven other youths who are part of a project called Children of 
War, now touring Los Angeles schools to educate and motivate their American 
peers, the question was typical. 
</P>
<P>
It spoke, in a way, of the divided world faced by many of the students in their 
audiences last Friday at Glendale and Hoover high schools, where an increasing 
number of students from war-torn countries are trying to mix into American 
teen-age life. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale schools were two stops on a three-week tour by members of Children 
of War, a project sponsored by the Religious Task Force, an interfaith, New 
York-based group. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, according to its literature, recruits and pays for teen-agers 
from troubled areas, including the United States, to share their experiences 
with American youth and promote grass-roots action and education about "social 
injustice." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's eight visitors made up one of two groups touring Los Angeles, 
speaking for free to student, church and community groups. Some had emigrated 
to the United States, some were simply visiting as part of the tour. One was a 
teen-age American mother from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving at Hoover, where several hundred students filled an auditorium, 
they spoke in English about their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Sanaa Al Okbi, 19, a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship who attends a Jewish 
university in Jerusalem, talked softly into the microphone, her voice choked by 
tears. "I feel very strongly inside that I'm Palestinian. But I can't say that 
in my country. It's very dangerous. But I have no choice. I study in school 
Jewish religion, Jewish language, Jewish history. I know their history better 
than I know my own. 
</P>
<P>
"The land without people is our land," said Al Okbi, wearing a traditional 
Palestinian frock, a kofia. "I want peace for my people. I want freedom. I want 
to say I'm Palestinian without fear." 
</P>
<P>
Asi Degani, a T-shirt- and sneaker-clad 18-year-old from Israel, put his hands 
in his jeans pockets and spoke calmly. "In six months I'll have to go into the 
Israeli Army, and I'll have to stand in front of kids 7, 8 or 9 who will throw 
stones or Molotov cocktails at me and I'll have to shoot them. 
</P>
<P>
"The question," he said, as Al Okbi wept in her chair behind him, "is not 
whether I'll shoot back but whether I should be there in the first place. The 
answer, of course, is no." 
</P>
<P>
Saroeum Phoung, 17, a refugee from Cambodia now living in Boston, talked of his 
harrowing escape from the Khmer Rouge regime. "It's hard for a kid like me to 
be born into this world where all I see, all I hear is people killing each 
other and a world screaming for help. 
</P>
<P>
"My family spent five years living in a refugee camp in Thailand before we made 
it to the United States," he said. "When I got here, I thought it meant peace 
and freedom. But it didn't. Everyone says 'go back, we don't want you here.' 
This world has shown no mercy to me. Only pressure and pain. Now, I just want 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
Like several hundred other students, Lisa Dohren, 18, a tall, blonde Hoover 
senior, sat captivated by the words. "I think it's really good that they, like, 
talked about it," she said. "You hear it on the news and you see it on TV but 
you never talk to people firsthand. It makes it real." 
</P>
<P>
Reality is closer than some think. More than 65% of the district's 24,000 
students are Asian, Latino, Filipino, Mid-Eastern or Pacific Islander, 
according to district figures. Many of those only recently emigrated from their 
homelands, said Alice Petrossian, director of intercultural education for 
Glendale schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We have children from Vietnam who are boat people," Petrossian said. "We have 
children who were in the earthquake in Soviet Armenia. You could go to any 
school site and find children who are willing to share their stories." 
</P>
<P>
One of Dohren's schoolmates, James Phan, listened to Phoung's speech and nodded 
in painful agreement. Phan, 17, came to Glendale in 1988 from a Cambodian 
refugee camp. His father had been killed by the Khmer Rouge; his mother, he 
said, died last month in the camp. 
</P>
<P>
But Phan, a junior, said he does not share his experiences with his classmates 
at Hoover. And they usually don't ask. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be a melting pot, but it's like oil and water," Jessica 
DiLullo, 17, a Hoover senior, said while standing near Phan. 
</P>
<P>
After their speeches, the Children of War stepped down from the stage and 
mingled with Hoover students, who approached them incredulously. The visitors, 
who during their tour may make six to seven presentations each day, welcomed 
the interest. 
</P>
<P>
"At Venice High, one student asked me if I had to ride a camel to school," 
Degani laughed, with a trace of weariness. "It's not discouraging that they 
don't know. It's discouraging when they don't care after they know." 
</P>
<P>
At Glendale High School, where the Children of War gave three presentations in 
a classroom, their stories made Chelsey Overstreet, former student body 
president, cry. 
</P>
<P>
"We were complaining last period about a lot of little things -- friendships, 
weights, stuff like that," said Overstreet, 17. "Then when you see kids our own 
age going through those things. . . . And we worry that there aren't any 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
Overstreet and two cheerleaders, Marisa Battaglia and Christie Denzel, stood 
together and mulled their own, related problem: the divisions between them and 
their immigrant classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"There's none of the violence, but there's a lot of prejudice," said Battaglia. 
"It's crossing the line that's hard. What do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Sami, 17, an Iranian immigrant now living in San Francisco, sat with the 
other Children of War in the school's cafeteria and saw Overstreet cry. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, she told Glendale students how the Iran-Iraq war had taken the lives 
of her relatives and the mind of her brother. Now she smiled and answered 
Battaglia's question. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them cry and apologize, but it's not their fault," Sami said. "I say 
that when we cry for each other, we can feel the pain in our hearts. And then 
we can start finding peace."

EDUCATION: THE BOARD DECIDES AGAINST A NATIONWIDE SEARCH AND CHOOSES THE 
INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT IN A MOVE THAT TAKES SOME MEMBERS BY SURPRISE.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that surprised even some of its own members, the Lynwood school board 
Tuesday dropped plans for a nationwide search for a new superintendent and 
decided to hire interim Supt. Audrey Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Richard Armstrong led the move to hire Clarke. "There is no need 
to pay $10,000 to $15,000 on a search firm when we already have a good person 
in the position. I happy with her performance," he said in an interview after 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong's proposal at the board meeting apparently was unexpected. Board 
member Thelma Williams left the room rather than vote, saying she was surprised 
and needed time to think about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rachel Chavez abstained. "If I had time to think about it, I would 
have left the room, too," she said after the meeting. "I think we rushed this." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Joe T. Battle joined Armstrong Tuesday in voting for Clarke. 
Board member Willard Hawn Reed voted against the motion. Reed said he favored a 
nationwide search. The board officially will be listed as approving Clarke's 
appointment by a 3-1 vote because Chavez's abstention is recorded as a yes vote 
under board rules. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their reservations about the suddenness of the vote, Reed, Williams and 
Chavez said they will support Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent also said she was not prepared for the board's decision. 
"I didn't expect this but I'm happy," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who has been with the district since 1977, succeeds LaVoneia Steele, 
who resigned under fire in January. 
</P>
<P>
The board said at the time a nationwide search would be conducted to find a 
superintendent for the troubled district of 14,500 students. Clarke applied for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said later that she wants to assemble a group of parents and others to 
suggest solutions to the district's most pressing problem, overcrowding. She 
said parents who oppose year-round schools would be represented. 
</P>
<P>
After numerous protests from parents, the board Tuesday voted to delay for at 
least another year a plan to start a year-round experiment to relieve 
overcrowding in three elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of Clarke's contract still must be worked out. The board asked its 
attorney, Bill Brown, to work out terms of the contract and have it ready by 
the next meeting April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke was an assistant principal and a principal at Lynwood High School before 
being named associate superintendent in 1985. The board increased Clarke's 
salary from $69,000 to $81,000 when she was named interim superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
She earned a bachelor's degree in foreign languages at Howard University in 
Washington, and a master's degree in educational administration at UCLA.

The Ventura County Symphony, conducted by Frank Salazar, will present French 
pianist Daniele Arpajou on Saturday and Sunday at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium. 
She is a professor of music at the Conservatoire de Savigny in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"Daniele is a fine veteran performer and is currently on world tour. She 
performed with the symphony five years ago and we have asked for a return 
engagement," said Karine Beesley, executive director of the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Arpajou will perform Debussy's "La Mer," "Variations Symphoniques" by Franck 
and "Symphonie Fantastique" by Berlioz. 
</P>

A WATERFALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finding a naturally formed waterfall in the middle of the High Sierra or 
Yosemite National Park isn't unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Finding one in the middle of Thousand Oaks, however, is a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Not very many people know about it," said Tom Hoegeman, outdoor recreation 
unit leader for the Conejo Recreation and Park District. "Even people who live 
close to the park often say they didn't know it was there." 
</P>
<P>
The 50-foot Paradise Falls is only one of the attractions for children at 
Wildwood Park, a 1,400-acre recreation area just west of the Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Each Saturday from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., children and their parents are led by a 
naturalist on a leisurely hike through the park, taking in the area's plant and 
wildlife along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, everything is starting to bloom, and it's just beautiful," Hoegeman 
said. "Out on the mesa, on the way to the waterfall, you can see shooting 
stars, wild onion, chocolate lilies, California poppies, wild hyacinth and 
purple sage. The kids love it." 
</P>
<P>
In a park with more than 60 species of birds, 37 species of mammals and 22 
species of reptiles and amphibians, spotting wildlife along the way is 
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been with groups when we saw mule deer, bobcats, coyotes, possums, hawks, 
rabbits, vultures and ravens. We also have weasels and badgers, but we don't 
see them too often," Hoegeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Though an occasional mountain lion has been known to enter the park in search 
of food, Hoegeman said that no visitor has ever reported being harmed by an 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
The site of American Indian hunting camps 6,000 years ago, Wildwood is as rich 
in history as it is in wildlife. From the 1930s through the 1960s, the park 
became the backdrop for numerous Hollywood films, including "Wuthering Heights" 
and "Sands of Iwo Jima." Today, Wildwood serves mainly as a sanctuary for 
wildlife displaced by urban development. 
</P>
<P>
The weekends hikes, however, are not the only activities offered at the park. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER ACTIVITIES 
</P>
<P>
On the second Saturday of each month, families can participate in a "night 
awareness" hike from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Led by a district naturalist, 
participants learn to trust their night vision while they look for wildlife 
that often stays hidden during the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them to bring a flashlight, but then encourage them not to use it," 
Hoegeman said. "We're not telling ghost stories or anything, and so this is 
really fun for the kids." The cost for the night hike is $1 per person. 
</P>
<P>
On the fourth Saturday of each month is "Saturday Night S'mores" at the park. 
Participants meet at the Big Sky Drive entrance to the park at 7 p.m. and are 
led to the park's nature center, where they sing songs around a campfire and 
roast marshmallows. The cost for the night of s'mores -- a campfire favorite 
made from graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallows -- is $2 per person. 
Reservations are requested. 
</P>
<P>
On May 19, Wildwood Park once again will offer its family overnight program, 
discontinued for several years after Proposition 13 budget cuts took effect. 
After an evening hike to the park's nature center, which now is open every 
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., families will have a barbecue dinner around a 
campfire. Later, they'll sleep under the stars or in tents they have brought 
with them. Registration for the family overnight, which costs $4 per person, is 
required.

VALLEY BLVD. PLAN ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-month effort to draft a development plan for Valley Boulevard entered its 
last phase Monday night as the City Council voted unanimously to give the plan 
preliminary approval. 
</P>
<P>
The plan designates what types of developments -- hotels, offices, restaurants, 
apartments -- would be permitted along the boulevard's three-mile stretch 
through Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved four amendments recommended by the Planning 
Commission, including one that would exclude a residential area near Fremont 
Avenue and Shorb Street from the plan. Homeowners there had told the council 
that they wanted to protect their neighborhood from being rezoned for 
commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
During the preparation of the plan, the city imposed a building moratorium 
along the busy commercial corridor. If the plan receives final approval next 
month, the moratorium, which was supposed to last until January, 1991, would be 
lifted, Councilman Boyd Condie said. 
</P>
<P>
A final vote is scheduled for April 9.

<P>
The San Gabriel Region of United Way has set up a "mini-grant" program for 
agencies dealing with aging, homelessness, youth recovery and child care for 
residents of Bassett, Industry, Hacienda Heights, La Puente, Rowland Heights 
and Valinda. 
</P>
<P>
An informational meeting for agencies will be held at 10 a.m. April 5 at 
Hillgrove Center, 1234 Valencia St., Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time mini-grants will be for up to $5,000. The application deadline for 
grant proposals is April 20. Applications should be mailed to United Way Inc., 
P.O. Box 58, Arcadia, 91066. 
</P>
<P>
United Way organized its Underserved Geographic Area Committee, which is 
soliciting the grant proposals, after a study concluded that the southeastern 
portion of the San Gabriel Valley did not have enough community support 
services.

HEARING ON ELECTRICITY RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors on Tuesday scheduled a public hearing on a proposed 
electric rate hike that would increase the average household's monthly bill by 
$1.96. 
</P>
<P>
The board will listen to public testimony on the matter beginning at 7 p.m. 
during its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed change, a typical single-family home using 400 kilowatt 
hours of electricity monthly would pay $35.42, a $1.96 increase from the 
current $33.46 charge. A commercial customer using 2,000 kilowatt hours per 
month and now paying $173.90 would pay $187.15. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, slated to take effect May 1, would enable the city-run electric 
utility to partially fund a two-year, $39.8-million capital improvement 
program. In addition, the increase would help fund the transfer of $6.4 million 
from the Power Fund to the General Fund next year. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the board tentatively approved an ordinance setting such 
yearly transfers at 8% of the gross retail income of the Power Fund. 
Previously, the amounts of such transfers have fluctuated based in part on city 
operating needs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city's Utility Advisory Commission asked directors last year to 
set a more consistent transfer amount in order to ensure the financial 
independence and stability of the city's Water and Power Department. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the General Fund would receive $6.4 million next year, 
$7.7 million in 1992 and up to $9.7 million in 1995. Final approval requires a 
second vote of the board.

NEW ROUTE, LONGER HOURS APPROVED FOR SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council voted Tuesday to begin operating the popular Beeline 
shuttles two hours earlier and to expand service into the southern part of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion must be approved by the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, but city officials predicted the new southern route could be in 
operation by June. 
</P>
<P>
Under the council's proposal, the free shuttle service would begin at 7 a.m., 
instead of 9 a.m. Expanding the hours is expected to cost an additional $8,800 
per month. The goal is to serve RTD commuters and motorists who drop their cars 
off for servicing before work, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new southern route would begin at the Amtrak station on Cerritos and 
Gardena avenues and run north along Central Avenue to Broadway. The shuttle 
would travel east on Broadway, south on Brand Boulevard, west on Laurel Street, 
south on Central back to the train station. Two shuttles would travel the 
20-minute route, separated by 10-minute intervals. The new southern route is 
expected to cost $165,000 to start up and operate for the first year. 
</P>
<P>
The southern route is aimed at patrons who visit auto dealers, medical offices, 
restaurants and other businesses in that part of the city.

<P>
PETITION ON UNION ELECTION FOR CITY WORKERS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bellflower officials have approved a petition that lays the groundwork for an 
election for blue-collar city workers to decide if they want to be represented 
by a union. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Administrator Craig Nealis said that representatives of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees were notified of 
the petition, which was filed Feb. 6 and approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to city guidelines for union elections, the city must wait another 30 
days to find out whether any other employee organization wants to represent the 
same workers. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives have accused the city of stalling to prevent an election, 
but city leaders say they are following the rules set by the resolution. "We're 
not against unions," Mayor John Ansdell said. "If they (city employees) can get 
a union together and we can work together, more power to them. A man has got a 
right to make a good living."

deposit fees in the unattended honor boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The item is expected back before the council in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
There are honor boxes at three beach parking lots: 810 Pacific Coast Highway, 
and 1670 and 1750 Appian Way. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, the city installed the honor boxes to generate income from 
those lots, which were deemed too small to pay for a staffed operation. 
</P>
<P>
But the private operator, Executive Parking Inc., reported that many people 
were parking without paying. Police patrols of the three parking lots are 
expected to increase the annual revenue from $39,000 to nearly $90,000.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING LOAN FOR CITY CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena officials have approved a $45,000 housing assistance loan for recently 
hired City Clerk Marvell Herren, dropping an earlier plan to buy her a $305,000 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was approved Tuesday by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The city will carry a second mortgage on Herren's new home on Cheviotdale 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Herren, who left her job in Foster City in October to work for Pasadena, asked 
for housing assistance as a condition of employment. After she failed to find a 
buyer for her house in Foster City, directors decided to buy the Cheviotdale 
Drive home and allow her to live there, rent deferred, for up to a year while 
she tried to sell her old home. The plan was for Herren to buy the house from 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials dropped that plan when Herren found a buyer for the 
Foster City house and no longer needed the city to buy the Cheviotdale Drive 
house outright. But since she still needs $45,000 to complete the purchase of 
the house, directors approved the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Herren will pay only interest -- at a rate of 8% -- on $25,000 for five years. 
At the end of five years, she must repay the $25,000. However, the city has 
agreed to forgive the interest and principal on the remaining $20,000 if she 
stays with the city for seven years.

OUT AND ABOUT: MONTHLY PROGRAMS FOR THE STARRY-EYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODNEY BOSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal Jandorf sometimes worries that Southern California is drowning in a sea of 
lights. Once a month, he and a group go up to the Charles Temple Observatory at 
Moorpark College to take a look at the evening skies. They don't always get 
that far. 
</P>
<P>
"The light pollution," he lamented. "It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Jandorf, 41, who has been teaching astronomy at Moorpark College since 1984, 
organizes the Sunday Night Astronomy Program put on by the college's community 
services department. The series gives serious and novice astronomers a close 
encounter with the heavens via the observatory's powerful telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Jandorf and Moorpark College astronomy lab instructor Dennis Leatart lecture on 
a different astronomical subject each month and show slides. A recent slide 
show about Jupiter included photographs taken by the Voyager space probe. 
</P>
<P>
The observatory sits atop a hill on campus, strategically placed to take 
advantage of an area considerably less polluted by light. But the electric 
evidence of city life is not far off. 
</P>
<P>
"See that?" Jandorf said, pointing eastward toward a bank of rolling hills 
silhouetted against a glow. "That's Simi Valley, and farther down, Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a switch to shut 'em both off when we get ready to use the telescopes," 
Jandorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Since October, 1987, an average of 150 people have congregated each month at 
the observatory's little amphitheater. Dressed warmly and sitting on blankets 
that protect them from the cool cement benches, astronomy enthusiasts of all 
ages are taught about constellations such as the seven sisters, Betelgeuse and 
Sirius, "the Dog Star." 
</P>
<P>
After Jandorf and Leatart are finished with their separate lectures and slide 
shows -- some of which make use of their own photographs -- they lead the 
participants to the observatory's Celestron 14-inch-diameter telescope. Groups 
of 10 climb the 11 steps to the scope that takes them up to 900 times closer to 
their chosen astral subject. They step into the steel dome structure, dimly lit 
with red light, and are enveloped in New Age music emanating from a boom box. 
</P>
<P>
The voyage begins. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be looking at a globular cluster," Jandorf said at a recent 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds like something that accumulates on the bottom of my bathtub," one 
participant said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jandorf, a globular cluster is a massive star conglomeration 
containing tens of thousands of stars, held together by the gravity of a black 
hole located in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the main telescope, Jandorf and his assistants also set up a 
number of other smaller scopes. 
</P>
<P>
The next program in the series will be held 8:30 p.m. April 22, when spring 
skies ought to provide optimum viewing for stargazers. 
</P>
<P>
May's program will feature distant galaxies, and amateur astrophotography will 
be covered in June. 
</P>
<P>
There is a $3 charge each month. No registration is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
For information, call 378-1408. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOOKING AT THE HEAVENS 
</P>
<P>
Activities for people who want to put stars in their eyes: 
</P>
<P>
* The Ventura County Astronomical Society holds monthly meetings featuring 
lectures and seminars by professionals and amateurs on a variety of topics. 
Slide shows, movies and panel discussions are given, along with equipment 
demonstrations and reviews. Observing sessions are also held each month at 
selected sites around Southern California. Field trips are taken to places such 
as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Mt. Wilson. The society offers Starline, a 
24-hour hot line for updated astronomy news and information on club events at 
529-7813. Membership costs $30 per year for an individual or family. The group 
meets 7:30 p.m. on the third Friday of each month at the Moorpark College 
Science Building, Room 202. 
</P>
<P>
* Ventura Parks and Recreation will hold "Spring Skywatch" 8 to 9:30 p.m. May 3 
at Dennison Park, 7250 Ojai-Santa Paula Road, Ojai. Astronomer Ernest Underhay 
will lecture about stars, constellations and other heavenly bodies. A telescope 
will be available for viewing. There is a $5 charge. For information, call 
Ventura Parks and Recreation at 658-4726. 
</P>
<P>
* Comet Austin, discovered about six months ago, will pass over Southern 
California during mid-April and will be appearing until the end of May. To see 
it, look toward the northeastern part of the sky about one hour before sunrise. 
"Although comets are unpredictable and sometimes nothing but duds, we have our 
fingers crossed that Austin will put on a show," astronomer Hal Jandorf said.

WILLIAM VAN ORDEN DIES; FIXED LOY STATUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Van Orden, the sculptor known for his meticulous restorations of Venice 
High School's statue of actress Myrna Loy after numerous assaults on it by 
vandals, has died at 67. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden, who completed his 12th restoration of the statue despite ill health 
and waning strength, died of cancer March 18 at the Country Villa Westwood, a 
nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Van Orden worked thousands of hours repairing the Loy statue 
and two other statues at the entrance of the campus that were the target of 
countless pranks and acts of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me the Don Quixote of Venice," he said in a Times article last year. 
"They don't realize that I take that as a compliment. Myrna is my windmill." 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden was honored in June by the Venice High School student body at a 
dedication ceremony for the newly restored statue, which is now enclosed in a 
protective iron cage. He was also awarded a proclamation from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Myrna Loy statue first came to Van Orden's attention after vandals in 1978 
used dynamite to blow off its head and arms. A year later, Van Orden drove by 
and saw the damaged statue and, grabbing a tool box, began making repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I took out my chisel and mallet and started hammering on it when the principal 
came out and asked me, 'What are you doing?' " he told The Times. "I said, 'I'm 
here to fix the statue." 
</P>
<P>
The Venice artist began his most recent restoration about a year ago after 
vandals battered the heads of all three statues. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden again rushed in to do repairs, but this time, he said, he did not 
believe he would live to finish the job. Doctors had told the artist that his 
death was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided not to abandon her," he said at the time. "I had to return one more 
time. This is my life's work, and after I finish this job I feel I can pass the 
job on to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
But Van Orden managed to complete the restoration of the 7-foot-tall statue of 
Loy, which is a depiction of the goddess Venus rising from the sea. It was 
sculpted in the 1920s by Harry Winebrenner, a nationally known sculptor who 
also taught art at Venice High School. He chose as his model a 16-year-old art 
student named Myrna Williams, who later gained fame on the screen as Myrna Loy. 
Winebrenner used student models for the two other statues as well. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden received an outpouring of support and national attention following 
news reports about his efforts to preserve the statue. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted so much to see it declared a historical landmark so it could be 
protected and preserved from future damage," said Rodan Van Orden, the artist's 
19-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden said his father never felt he received the recognition he deserved 
from his work on the statue. "A lot of the focus was always on Myrna Loy," he 
said. "He always felt he was not the story without her. You know he was a fine 
artist, a good painter." 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden, who was born in New York City, is survived by Rodan; his mother, 
Emily Van Orden, 92; a sister, Jane Kowach, and three brothers: Arthur, Frank 
and Raymond.

LIBRARY HAS 5,000 TITLES TO CHECK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it had been the corner video store, most customers would have done a double 
take. 
</P>
<P>
In the section labeled "New Arrivals" were titles such as "The Prisoner of 
Zenda" with Ronald Colman, "The Beautiful Blonde From Bashful Bend" with Betty 
Grable and "The Story of Louis Pasteur" with Paul Muni. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, though, most people in the Thousand Oaks Library last week simply 
gave the section a glance, some of them stopping to pick up a cassette and read 
its back cover before heading to the rows of videos spread out before them. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I found out about this, I've come here at least twice a week," said June 
McGahey of Thousand Oaks as she placed a third videotape under her arm. "They 
have everything, from way back until now." 
</P>
<P>
The library has come a long way since 1981, when it purchased its first 
videocassette. Today, the collection has more than 5,000 titles and the library 
is constantly looking for new acquisitions, according to Kathleen Sullivan, 
division manager for collection and reference services. 
</P>
<P>
Feature films, which include dramas and comedies from 1930 to 1990, cost 
library card holders $1 per day. Educational videos, which include everything 
from foreign language films subtitled in English to how-to videos on building 
homes, are free for seven days. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've tried to do is get as wide a variety as possible," said Sullivan, 
who is responsible for adding new titles to the collection. "You can find 
classics, to videos on opera and history. Those aren't usually what you'd find 
in most video stores." 
</P>
<P>
Each week, Sullivan said, patrons check out about 3,000 feature films, which 
were purchased with funds from the nonprofit Thousand Oaks Library Foundation. 
Educational videos, purchased with library funds, are checked out at about the 
same rate, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of the library's wide selection of videos at a low cost upset owners 
of local video stores. When the library announced plans to create the 
collection, Sullivan said, local video store owners were not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the library would present unfair competition, Sullivan said 
video store owners met with library representatives and City Council members to 
express their objections to the idea. It wasn't until library representatives 
explained that they would most likely be attracting a different type of 
clientele that the protests subsided, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really not in competition with them," Sullivan said. "Video stores tend 
to carry the more popular recent releases, the hot stuff. When people come here 
and say they can never get a hot one, we send them to the video stores." 
</P>
<P>
That spirit of cooperation apparently works both ways. Carol Clark, who works 
in a video store in Calabasas, said she regularly sends customers to the 
Thousand Oaks library for titles the store doesn't carry. 
</P>
<P>
"We get videos the day they are released, and most of our customers are college 
students who want the new releases," Clark said. "But when they want an old 
movie, I tell them to go to the library because there's a much bigger 
selection." 
</P>
<P>
With so many titles to choose from, which ones are the critic's choice? 
</P>
<P>
In the educational section of the library, rock 'n' roll fans might want to 
check out Paul McCartney's film on rock legend Buddy Holly, which can be kept 
at no cost for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Armchair travelers can take a look at a video guide to the Mexican Riviera or a 
90-minute journey to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Sociology buffs can get their fill with a video on the royal wedding of 
Britain's Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, or take a leisurely peek into 
"Alcatraz, America's Toughest Prison." 
</P>
<P>
And then, for weekend athletes who want the weekend off, there are always great 
titles such as "A Guide to Bicycle Touring," "Come Sail With Us" or "Baseball 
the Pete Rose Way." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, on second thought, maybe we'll skip that last one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A FAST-FORWARD THROUGH VIDEO STORES 
</P>
<P>
Many local video outlets are equipped to provide even the most finicky 
cine-maniac with something other than the latest from Andrew Dice Clay. Here is 
a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
* Salzer's Video -- 5801 Valentine Road, Ventura, 656-5801. Open Sunday through 
Thursday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Salzer's has everything from public service videos that discuss life's daily 
issues, to instructional videos on how to paint, to the best of the cult 
classics. "We have about 150 cult titles . . . we've got all the Divines, the 
Andy Warhols," says Becky Beckner, the store's manager. "Warhol is new. He's 
cult because he's dead now. His art is one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
* Ojai Video -- 305 E. Matilija St., Ojai, 646-9652. Open Monday through 
Saturday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m. and Sunday, noon-8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This store specializes in foreign films so get the old Berlitz out. All the 
Berlitzes, in fact. They've got tapes in Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Hungarian, 
Swedish, German and Indian, among others. Selections date as far back as the 
'30s, but the latest releases are also available. 
</P>
<P>
* The Lord's Storehouse -- 1871 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks, 
495-6136. Open Monday through Friday, 9:30 a.m.-6 p.m. and Saturday, 9:30 
a.m.-5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
See, there is a critic more influential than Siskel and Ebert. 
</P>
<P>
The Storehouse's inventory is made up predominantly of videos with a Christian 
slant. 
</P>
<P>
"We also provide some home-school curriculum," says Kathy Wolski, general 
manager. "So we have some Dickens, some Shakespeare, some opera. There was a 
nude scene in 'Romeo and Juliet,' but we had it edited out. Everything here is 
very good and clean." 
</P>
<P>
* Video Depot -- 2520 E. Main St., Ventura, 643-7902. Open Monday, 8 a.m.-9 
p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 9 a.m.-10 
p.m. and Sunday, 11 a.m.-8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Depot specializes in classics, going back as far as "Wings, from 1928. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tinke Reid says her clientele is made up mostly of adults, but that 
younger people come in on occasion. "Most of our customers are looking for 
movies without violence and sex. The younger ones come in only when they have 
to do a book report and are too lazy to read the book." 
</P>
<P>
* 5th Street Video II -- 211 W. Pleasant Valley Road, Oxnard, 486-7777. Open 
every day, 10 a.m.-9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This store specializes in Mexican videos or videos dubbed into Spanish. Owner 
Bernardo Castellanos says the videos date back to about 1935. 
</P>
<P>
There are some well-known titles among the 600 or so dubbed videos, including 
"The Dirty Dozen," "Rocky" and "Rambo." 
</P>
<P>
* Video Adventures -- 323 E. Matilija St., Suite 110, Ojai, 646-4315. Open 
Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m. and Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m.-10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for horror videos, forget it. Manager Kim Perry says the 
store isn't really into them. But if it's the classics you want, Video 
Adventures has about 300 selections. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the old classics going back to 'Grapes of Wrath' and 'A Guy Named 
Joe,' " says Perry, "and we just purchased 'Bus Stop' with Marilyn Monroe." 
Video Adventures also has a sizable selection of movies with John Wayne, Jack 
Lemmon, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
* Video City -- 210 Arneill Road, Camarillo, 987-6800. Open every day, 10 
a.m.-9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Video City owner Mick Thiesen prides himself on his collection of National 
Geographic videos. "Just about anything they put out, I'll order," he says. So 
far there are about 60 titles to choose from, ranging in subject from whales to 
Mt. Vesuvius.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BELL MAN ADMITS ROLE IN TAVERN KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Bell man pleaded guilty last week to helping two brothers carry out a 
shooting in a Glendale tavern in which two men were killed and a third wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Constancio Villagrana, 25, pleaded guilty Friday to being an accessory after 
the fact for his role in a Nov. 24 shooting at the Rustic Inn bar on San 
Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
Villagrana will be sentenced April 20 in Pasadena Superior Court. He could 
spend up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Villagrana initially faced one count of conspiracy to attempt murder, which 
carries a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Villagrana, Rodolfo Marquez, 21, and Manuel Marquez, 
25, left the Rustic Inn after being involved in a fistfight, then returned 
about half an hour later to retaliate. They allege that Rodolfo Marquez, 
accompanied by Villagrana and armed with a gun that Manuel Marquez had given 
him, entered the bar and began shooting, while Manuel Marquez waited in a 
getaway truck outside. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Lemus, 34, of Los Angeles and Jose Davila, 33, of Glendale were killed 
and Javier Maldonado, 48, of Los Angeles was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Marquez brothers, of Atwater, each are charged with two counts of murder, 
one count of attempted murder and one count of conspiracy to attempt murder. 
Their pretrial hearing has been scheduled for April 20 in Pasadena Superior 
Court.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARKS WORKER DENIES STEALING TONS OF BLOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aveteran Glendale parks worker Monday pleaded not guilty to a charge of 
stealing nine tons of paving blocks from a city yard. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Bowman, 46, a 21-year city employee, has been ordered to appear May 8 
in Glendale Municipal Court for a preliminary hearing on the grand theft 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
City officials ordered Bowman to stay home from work pending disciplinary 
action after he was arrested March 12. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, 1,327 concrete paving blocks missing from a city 
yard were found in the rear of Bowman's home in Glendale, laid out to form a 
20-foot by 30-foot parking area. The hexagonal blocks, which have since been 
dug up and returned to the city, were valued at more than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman and another city employee were accused of stealing the blocks by an 
anonymous tipster who telephoned police and sent a letter to city officials. 
Records indicate that at least 400 other blocks are missing from a locked 
maintenance yard at the Scholl Canyon baseball fields. No other arrests have 
been made.

LIBRARY TO STAY OPEN DURING WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 60-year-old Venice branch library will remain open while undergoing 
earthquake retrofitting and until a new facility is built, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The branch library at 610 California Ave., built in 1930, was ordered closed 
several years ago by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety for 
failing to meet earthquake safety standards, but library officials obtained 
extensions to keep the building open because funds for the retrofitting were 
not available. 
</P>
<P>
The extensions were to expire April 15, but a community group, Friends of 
Venice Library, and representatives from City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's 
office persuaded the Department of Building and Safety to let the building stay 
open if initial retrofitting work was done by the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are tearing apart the roof after library hours to install braces that 
will attach the roof to the walls. The construction poses no danger to library 
patrons and should be completed within six months, said construction and 
maintenance supervisor Edward Kurzyniec. 
</P>
<P>
The library, which officially qualifies as a historical building, is one of the 
city-owned buildings whose retrofitting would be paid for by a $374-million 
bond issue on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, design plans are being drawn for a new $2.3-million branch library 
with twice the capacity of the existing building. Officials estimate 
construction on the 10,500-square-foot facility scheduled to be built at 501 S. 
Venice Blvd. should be completed by June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The old building will be used as a community center after the new one is 
completed, officials said.

NIGHT LIFE: MICHAEL ON FIRE LIVES UP TO NAME WHEN WRITING AND SINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know you've made The Big Time when you no longer need a last name. Who can 
forget Cleopatra, Elvis, Madonna, Bogie, Zsa Zsa, The Duke, God, Sabu, Goofy? 
Know what I mean? Electric folk singer Michael on Fire is another example of a 
guy with no surname. All he needs now is half of Milli Vanilli's money. 
</P>
<P>
Michael On Fire, which is the singer's legal name, lives in the San Fernando 
Valley by way of Detroit and loves the Lakers, except when they play the 
Pistons. He says that a Sioux Indian medicine man gave him his name. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not performing, MOF is writing. And writing. And writing. He has 
between 1,200 and a zillion songs -- this guy could play longer than the 
Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people water their plants every day; I write. Not every song is a gem, 
but there's usually a line or two worth saving for another song -- I've got 
quite a catalogue. The more you do something, the better you get at it. I'm a 
lifer. This is what I do. I feel like I've got five or six good albums in me 
right now. When I play, each set is longer than an album." 
</P>
<P>
Michael On Fire has this booming, sort of raspy voice that's as big as all 
outdoors -- the sort of voice everyone on MTV wishes were his. He's got this 
wild mane of hair, without mousse, and he doesn't look like one of those 
cheerleaders from high school. He's commercial-sounding and slicker than the 
trail of a 50-foot slug, not plastic and phony but convincing and real. Better 
yet, he never asks the obvious, "How's it goin', Ven-ch-ura?" 
</P>
<P>
And the singer is so relentlessly friendly and upbeat that he could sell a 
raincoat to a cactus. When he's not on stage, MOF chats with people in the 
audience. He must be a direct descendant of Mr. Rogers and Captain Kangaroo. 
</P>
<P>
MOF writes these reflective ballads that are at once sad and funny about the 
Big Issues -- love, the homeless, the environment, offshore drilling, ERA, 
American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Usually accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, MOF has this tight backup band 
that just got tighter -- like Roseanne Barr in a wet suit . . . in Bakersfield 
. . . in August. Stevie Ray Davis recently joined MOF. He's a guitarist who's 
in the Texas Music Hall of Fame where he has joined the likes of Jimmy Vaughan 
and Stevie Ray Vaughan. MOF's folk rock songs now have a definite rockin' blues 
edge. Robbie Drum is the sax player and Tobias is the one-named percussionist. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not writing, Michael On Fire is Michael on tour. He's played in every 
state except Alaska and Hawaii and has opened for acts such as Stephen Stills, 
Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, Bob Seger, Jean Luc Ponty and the Art Ensemble of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"My strangest gig was my first-ever gig. It was in east Detroit, and I walked 
into this place with my guitar and they told me I had to sing from on top of 
the bar. So I'm up there doing 'Mr. Tambourine Man' when all of a sudden on 
each side of me was a bona fide stripper. Man, it got real hard to remember the 
lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
"I average about five gigs per week -- I'm doing 24 shows in April. But I don't 
do those industry hangout gigs. I'm not into competition and that's not how I 
care to participate. Most places I play don't have cover charges, except in 
January when I played Aspen and it cost forty bucks to get in and a beer cost 
seven bucks. Industry people tell me I'm overexposing myself, but hey, this is 
my job . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It must be working too. MOF has a mailing list of more than 2,500 plus a tape, 
"Pre-Dawn Chronicles." The tape is available at his gigs and contains some of 
his best work -- "Lucifer's Returned To Heaven," "Oh Picasso" and "Ride On Into 
Midnight." The tape is as popular as a bulletproof building in Beirut -- 3,000 
units sold. A new tape is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
MOF's influences are diverse. He cites Dion, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Lou 
Reed, Bob Dylan, Albert King, Fats Domino and Fleetwood Mac. About the only 
cover he ever does is an old Fleetwood Mac song -- Peter Green's "Woman's Got 
The Blues" -- from Fleetwood's blues guitar band days before Stevie Nicks and 
Christine McVie joined the group. 
</P>
<P>
Michael on Fire will be at the Red Cove in Ventura on Sunday, at Charlie's in 
Ventura every Monday in April and at the Hungry Hunter in Thousand Oaks every 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday in April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE TO GO 
</P>
<P>
FRIDAY 
</P>
<P>
The Lions I's (Charlie's Seaside Cafe, 362 California St., Ventura, 648-6688) 
Locals do original rockin' reggae that's irresistible to every foot within a 
12-block radius. 
</P>
<P>
SATURDAY 
</P>
<P>
Eric Johnson (Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura, 648-1936) The 
well-known guitar virtuoso is scheduled to make his local debut. 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
Michael On Fire (Red Cove, 1809 E. Main St., Ventura, 643-1101) He's got a 
voice as big as all outdoors, a zillion songs, a cool name and he performs with 
Texas Hall of Fame guitarist Stevie Ray Davis to boot. ( 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mondays at Charlie's through April, and Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays 
through April at the Hungry Hunter in Thousand Oaks, 847 N. Moorpark Road,

OLDEST COUNTY LIFEGUARD AT END OF CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For two generations, Richard Evans has stood sentry over the tawny beaches and 
federal-blue waves. Perhaps 30 people, by his commander's estimate, owe their 
lives to him. 
</P>
<P>
But the tide of time caught up with the oldest full-time lifeguard in Los 
Angeles County. Gray-haired but athletic, Evans retired recently at 64, forced 
not by age but by a knee injury to leave the post he has held since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"Time to go, time to go," mused the Manhattan Beach lifeguard, who at one point 
sued the county for age discrimination in order to continue his career. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to be my age, you start to slow down, and this injury didn't 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Evans' career came to an end this month in much the same way it had started -- 
saving a swimmer from a riptide. While making a rescue last autumn, he said, he 
stepped into an inshore hole in the sand and tore the cartilage in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
The injury helped bring to an end a vocation that began as a part-time job 
after World War II, when Evans, just out of the U.S. Army Air Forces and 
enrolled at Occidental College, went looking for summer work. 
</P>
<P>
With a friend, he came to Hermosa Beach to take a one-day lifeguard test. The 
applicants swam a race around the old Hermosa Pier, then demonstrated their 
lifesaving techniques by towing a land line out to a buoy that, had it been a 
victim, could have been pulled to shore. 
</P>
<P>
"They had an interview, you know, 'Why do you want to be a lifeguard?' " Evans 
recalled. "I said the usual thing, that I loved the beach." 
</P>
<P>
But the real reasons, he said, were that the money -- $1.09 an hour -- was good 
and the job seemed easy compared to construction work. 
</P>
<P>
He hadn't finished his first day on the job when he was called upon to save his 
first life. "They put me in the tower at 5th Street, right here at Hermosa," he 
recalled. "It was a busy weekend, it was crowded, and I was just sitting there 
when three people started yelling for help." 
</P>
<P>
A father and his two teen-age children were caught in a riptide, and Evans ran 
into the surf and pulled them in. He expected them not to show appreciation. 
The other lifeguards had warned him that drowning people are usually too 
embarrassed to express their gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
And indeed, the three walked off up The Strand after Evans had saved their 
lives, only to return a few moments later with a hamburger for him, just to say 
thanks. 
</P>
<P>
He was 21 years old. In the years that ensued, his commander, Lt. Wally 
Millican, guesses that Evans has saved more than 30 lives. Just this month, in 
fact, he pulled a heartbroken 16-year-old girl to shore after she tried to 
commit suicide by jumping off the Hermosa Beach pier, police reports show. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an amazing man," Millican said. "He has spent his entire 43 years of 
service right out here on the front lines, out in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 110 permanent and 630 part-time lifeguards on the county's roster of 
personnel, only a handful are older than 60 and none of the full-time 
lifeguards are older than Evans, said Eric Dourdon, assistant director of 
personnel for the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, Evans has had to qualify for the job by passing a rigorous physical 
trial. To keep fit, he said, he swims a mile at least three times a week. Until 
his knee surgery, he also ran barefoot in the sand. At 5 feet, 10 inches tall, 
he weighs a muscular 185 pounds. His blood pressure is 130 over 85. He wears 
glasses, he says, but only to read. In the course of his career, he has never 
reached a drowning swimmer too late to save the person's life. 
</P>
<P>
But Evans' career path hasn't been easy. For most of the time he has been a 
lifeguard, Evans has also held down a full-time job with the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, first as an elementary school teacher and later as a 
science consultant. For those 31 years, Evans was listed with the county as a 
"recurrent" lifeguard, on call summers and weekends when staffing was short. 
</P>
<P>
As a recurrent, his age was not an issue. But for full-time lifeguards, the 
county had an age limit. They would not hire anyone over 35. So in 1984, while 
Evans was still working for the school district, he allowed the federal Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission to use him as a plaintiff in a suit seeking 
to remove age barriers from public safety jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The suit eventually was dropped because the county that same year voluntarily 
removed the age cap in the wake of a federal court decision that struck down 
similar limits in the county fire and sheriff's departments. The decision was 
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, clearing the way for Evans to become a 
full-time lifeguard two years ago at the age of 62, when he retired from 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
His career, part time and full time, has spanned several generations of change 
in the South Bay. Evans remembers a time before the waves were dotted with the 
slick, dark wet suits of surfers, a time when a beachfront cottage could be had 
for $90 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the claims that the local beaches were once pristine, he remembers 
frequent close encounters with raw sewage in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
But some things don't change. 
</P>
<P>
The summers still smell of cocoa butter in the warm wind. The winter mornings 
are still milky with fog. There is still the swoosh, in quiet moments, of the 
heaving surf and the cries of distant gulls. 
</P>
<P>
And when a bronzed Adonis in Ray-Bans steps up to his post, the girls in the 
bikinis still come running up the steps of the tower to ask coyly what time it 
is.

<P>
The 1989-90 basketball season was highly successful for Glendale-area high 
school teams. 
</P>
<P>
Six boys' teams and seven girls' teams advanced to the City and Southern 
Section playoffs behind cohesive team play and outstanding individual 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Those achievements are reflected in the players who have been selected to The 
Times' All-Glendale girls' and boys' basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-member teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches who were 
asked to fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents. 
Observations of sportswriters and college scouts also were considered. 
</P>
<P>
Players, their coaches and parents are invited to The Times' basketball awards 
breakfast, scheduled for 9 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton. All-stars from 12 
circulation areas will be honored and players and coaches of the year from each 
area will be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the boys' team: 
</P>
<P>
Jrmirol Duncan, Ribet Academy -- A 5-foot-9 junior, Duncan was selected 
All-Southern Section after he averaged 17 points a game and ran the show as 
point guard for the Fighting Frogs, who won the Southern Section Small Schools 
Division championship and advanced to the second round of the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
John Hillman, Hoover -- One of the area's most prolific scorers, Hillman, a 6-3 
senior guard, averaged 20 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.

<P>
John Langly may not go out with a pick and shovel, but as far as he's 
concerned, walking the streets of Ventura is like mining for gold. 
</P>
<P>
For it is here, he says, tucked away in as many as 30 antique stores, that 
items from the past can still be found at reasonable prices, and where educated 
eyes have been known to spot bargains that set the imagination turning. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere you go there are great finds," says Langly, owner of Antique Alley, 
a Ventura store that sells the antiques and collectibles of 10 different 
dealers. "You just have to know what you're looking at." 
</P>
<P>
Many shoppers, some of whom drive up from Los Angeles over the weekend in 
search of a steal, would agree. And several claim to have had good fortune even 
without extensive knowledge of an item's value. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up to Ventura and found a brooch for $20. I didn't know what it was at 
the time, but I loved it," said Blair Ashton, a Los Angeles collector who said 
she regularly travels to antique shows across the country. When she had the 
brooch appraised, she learned it had been hand-made in Norway in 1880 and was 
worth $500. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of experience that really keeps you going," she said. "It's 
like being on a treasure hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura antique dealers don't claim that every purchase will turn out to be as 
fortuitous. What they do say, however, is that good buys -- whether on antique 
furniture and jewelry or collectibles such as plates and glassware -- are 
abundant. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last few years the antique stores in Ventura really have gained a 
reputation for having quality items that are priced significantly less than 
places like Los Angeles or Santa Barbara," said Dale Bowen, owner of Heirloom 
Antiques, a local store whose French buyer, Sylvain Caine, travels regularly to 
Europe in search of French and English furniture. "We get people coming here 
from all over the state, and antique store dealers come from all over the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Many store owners say that as much as 90% of their business is from 
out-of-towners. Some, store owners say, will whip out their checkbooks at the 
sight of a 77-inch French sideboard in perfect condition for $280 or a 
three-piece French bed set -- including an armoire and marble-top bed stand -- 
for $579. Others will snap up items such as a Victorian gold necklace, set with 
four diamonds and an amethyst, for $195; a turn-of-the-century brass lighting 
fixture for under $200; or a wood stove, made in 1880 and in mint condition, 
for $800. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers have the deals, they say, because there's none of the flash, dash 
or panache of L.A., and overheads are low. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that prices here are at least half of what they would be in Los 
Angeles or Santa Barbara," Langly said. "It just doesn't cost as much for us to 
be here." 
</P>
<P>
Although independent antique appraisers don't argue that Ventura offers some 
good bargains to shoppers looking to buy a certain kind of merchandise, they 
also say that comparing the city's antique stores to those in Los Angeles is 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Salsbury, a former antique appraiser with Sotheby's who now works as an 
independent fine arts appraiser in Los Angeles, said the antiques themselves 
are apt to be like the proverbial apples and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of antiques in the best store in Los Angeles will be completely 
different than in the best store in Ventura," Salsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the stores in Ventura that import from Europe, what you're essentially 
getting is used European furniture," he said. "In your better shop in Los 
Angeles, there might not be a single piece for under $1,500." 
</P>
<P>
Not having museum-quality antiques doesn't seem to bother local dealers who, 
with only minimal prodding, will talk expansively of the incredible bargains 
they have gotten at estate sales, yard sales or flea markets in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Langly likes to talk about the good finds he's come across over the years, 
usually because he happened to know an item's value when the seller did not. 
Take, for example, the antique barber's chair he said he picked up at a swap 
meet for a few dollars and turned around and sold to a collector -- who 
considered it a good price -- for $5,000. A few days later, he said, he learned 
that a similar chair had been sold at an auction on the East Coast for $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the two pieces of inlaid onyx glassware, made for only six 
months during the 1880s, that Langly said he had just read about in one of his 
numerous reference books on antiques and collectibles. He said he picked the 
pieces up in a thrift store in Oxnard for 50 cents and later sold them for 
$125. Even that price, he said, was a bargain for the buyer, considering that 
it was still half of the items' listed value. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens all the time that you come across something that the seller doesn't 
know the value of," he said. "Still, as long as I make my profit, it doesn't 
bother me if someone else buys it from me and then sells it at 10 times the 
price. And besides, antique stores around here wouldn't survive if we had that 
kind of a markup." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are cases in which store owners might not have the correct 
information about a piece, which doesn't always work to the customer's 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many dealers, and they all are selling to other dealers," said 
George Kovach, the former owner of an antique store in San Francisco who bought 
glassware and silver flatware from other dealers in Ventura. "So if one of them 
sells an item as something it's not to another dealer -- and it may be because 
that's what he was told it was when he bought it -- people are going to get 
taken. It happens all the time." 
</P>
<P>
In a business where the value of an item is often determined by what someone is 
willing to pay for it, some shoppers without much knowledge of antiques and 
collectibles still consider it best to let good sense be their guide. 
</P>
<P>
One woman browsing in a Ventura antique store said she saw a Fiesta dinner 
plate, an increasingly popular brand of dinnerware that was first made in the 
1930s, priced at nearly $30. She considered that price, no matter how 
fashionable the plates, to be "completely unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for many dealers and antique store addicts, the growing field of 
"collectibles" -- items that, because of their relative youth don't meet the 
100-year-old criterion for classification as antique -- represents a gold mine 
in itself. Many of the antique stores in Ventura carry a large supply of these 
items, ranging from tasteful Rookwood pottery from the 1930s to cartoon-painted 
restaurant glasses from the 1970s, once free with a large drink. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is stuff that people tossed out when they cleaned out their attics 
and didn't know would be valuable later on," said Kevin Ross, a collector in 
Fillmore who sells old glassware, silver and pottery at antique shows 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
That is something that will never happen to Tes Wolf, owner of Waxing Nostalgic 
Antiques in Ventura. Wolf drives two days each week to something she describes 
as an advanced course on spotting items of value and determining their worth: 
an antiques appraisal class at the University of Redlands. Students in the 
class go to various antique stores, she said, and examine items for age, rarity 
and condition. 
</P>
<P>
"For an antique dealer, the worst thing has got to be when you look right at 
something and don't know what it is or what it's worth," Wolf said. "You pass 
up a lot of things that way." 
</P>
<P>
But then there is the question of fashion. One reason some items in Ventura can 
be found at such reasonable prices, many store owners say, has to do with 
what's hot at the moment and what's not. As with clothes and music, tastes in 
antiques change. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years back, the country look came in, and all of a sudden the price of 
antique pine furniture went way up," Langly said. "Now that look is kind of 
dying down, and so are the prices." 
</P>
<P>
Bowen, of Heirloom Antiques, shook his head slowly at the memory of the pine 
craze: "It's a pretty terrible wood, but no one seemed to mind. I'm glad that 
people are interested in buying other styles now." 
</P>
<P>
Today, several store owners said, some of the hottest-selling antique furniture 
is California Mission, a simple, utilitarian design from the early 1900s. The 
style, which went out of fashion for many years, was revived when actress 
Barbra Streisand recently paid a record $365,000 for a California Mission 
sideboard, signed by famed furniture maker Gustav Stickley. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of dealers from Los Angeles who buy our California Mission 
furniture, and then turn around and sell it for twice or three times the 
price," said David Marcus, a sales assistant at Hall Place Antiques. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of irks me," he said, "that prices get inflated like that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOOKING FOR PATHS PAVED IN 'OLD' 
</P>
<P>
Where to start on the bargain-hunting trail? Below are only a few of Ventura's 
many antique stores: 
</P>
<P>
* Heirlooms Antiques, 494 Main St., 328 Main St., 327 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
Three stores, totaling 16,000 square feet, are packed with fixer to perfect 
French furniture. In abundance are Napoleon- and Louis XV-style beds and 
armoires, which store buyer Sylvain Caine, a native of France, brings back from 
his bimonthly trips to estate sales in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
One store has a wide selection of antique oak dressers, starting at about $180. 
</P>
<P>
* Snooty Fox, 1718 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
Co-owners Gus and Virginia Thiros, both certified antique appraisers, have 
gathered 5,000 square feet of antique jewelry, antique furniture, crystal 
glassware, Meisen figures, antique French clocks and other fine objects of art. 
</P>
<P>
* Antique Alley, 263 S. Laurel St. 
</P>
<P>
Ten dealers of mostly collectibles are under one roof here, selling glassware, 
pottery and some furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest-selling items at the store, according to owner John Langly, are 
brightly colored plates and dishes from the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
* Esther's Antiques, 1994 E. Thompson Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly Americana antiques and collectibles, with the emphasis on collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
Several furniture pieces date back to the early 1900s, such as mahogany chests 
and an iron, wood-burning cooking stove in near perfect condition, but the 
majority of items are from the 1930s onward. 
</P>
<P>
* Waxing Nostalgic Antiques, 1725 E. Main St. Mostly small furniture items and 
decorative pieces. The store also has a good collection of Rookwood pottery.

YOUTHFUL DESIGNERS ADD TALENTS TO STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL OFFERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Izod has its alligator, Ralph Lauren has his polo player and now Elizabeth 
Guzman has her three smiling strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
And although her designs will not be found on the runways of Paris or the 
boutiques of New York, a limited amount will be available in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven-year-old Guzman of Lemonwood Elementary School is the artistic talent 
behind the new Strawberry Festival youth T-shirts that will go on sale Monday 
at Pelican Clothing Co. The sixth-grader's design, which features three happy 
berries, was chosen from more than 170 entries as the official shirt artwork 
for the seventh annual festival on May 19 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year the youth T-shirt sold out on the first day of the event," said Bill 
Garlock, festival manager. "So this year we will sell a limited number of 
shirts and other souvenirs prior to the event so that local residents can have 
a chance to buy what they want." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the youth shirts in small sizes ($10), a few in adult sizes will 
be sold this year for the first time. The adult shirts, with a picture of this 
year's festival postera crystal dish filled with strawberriescosts $12. Some 
new items include suspenders with "California Strawberry Festival 1990" 
stitched on ($15) and sun visors ($7). 
</P>
<P>
The store at Channel Islands Harbor was chosen as the exclusive distributor of 
the items because it is situated at the festival site and "we want people to 
get acquainted with this area," Garlock said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the youth T-shirts were designed by commercial artists. But last 
year, festival organizers decided to give area school children a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"With an event that is growing in notoriety as quickly as the Strawberry 
Festival, it's important to make that extra effort to embrace the people in the 
area because, after all, this is their celebration. And what better way to pull 
in the community than to have the children play an important role in the 
event?" 
</P>
<P>
The idea for a contest came "pretty late in the game" last year, Garlock said. 
"I quickly scribbled down my thoughts on a napkin, gave it to my secretary and 
she made some phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
Although the contest wasn't as organized as Garlock said he would have liked, 
it was a success. The winning design by Sonia Lopez, then a third-grader at Mar 
Vista Elementary School, was so well received that the 300 youth shirts sold 
"much better than any of the commercial shirts ever did," Garlock said. 
</P>
<P>
This year 700 shirts will be printed and Sue Odgers, one of the four contest 
judges, said she expects them to sell out as well. There were more than twice 
as many design entries this year, and Odgers said there was something for 
everyone; from strawberry people to a big, red strawberry riding his surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
Designs are judged on originality, adaptability to printing on T-shirts, color 
and use of the strawberry theme. "But we also looked for that childlike 
quality," Odgers said. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's design, "strawberry" was spelled "straberry" and a "w" was later 
added, with an arrow pointing to where it should go. 
</P>
<P>
"I forgot the 'w' at first so the picture came out wrong, but I guess people 
liked it," Sonia said. 
</P>
<P>
And though she enjoyed the experience, she did find it difficult working with 
water colors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to keep all the different colors from getting mixed up." 
</P>
<P>
That particular medium was chosen because "Children love bold, bright colors," 
said Millie Downing, Lopez's former teacher. "The other reason is that children 
at this age need help learning how to draw things, including strawberries. I 
know how to make a strawberry using oils, so I was hoping the technique would 
transfer over. We had two practice sessions in making berries. And then on the 
third day I gave them a blank sheet of paper and we did our designs." 
</P>
<P>
Some pictures came out looking more like strawberries than others, Downing 
said. "But we didn't stress the competition. What we concentrated on was that 
every student who entered got a free ticket to the strawberry festival just for 
trying. Everyone was a winner and everyone had fun." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's teacher, Elva Perez, said her students also enjoyed the contest. "Many 
of them related particularly well with the strawberry theme because their 
parents work in the fields picking them. The sights and smells of strawberries 
are a part of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
The contest gives students an opportunity to feel they are an important part of 
the community, and it also unites the school, said Carolyn Banks, principal at 
Lemonwood. "Ever since Elizabeth won this year, our entire school has been 
basking in the glow. Also, the contest provides an opportunity for students to 
shine in other areas besides academics. And it shows that hard work leads to 
rewards and payoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth credits her achievement to hard work. "I wanted to win this contest 
with all my heart," she said. "So I kept working and working, trying to make my 
design better and better. That's how I won. 
</P>
<P>
"I like contests because they make me do my best and I like that. I want to be 
a success." 
</P>
<P>
Always interested in art, Guzman has been inspired by her accomplishments to 
pursue it further. But she isn't at all interested in pursuing fashion design.

TRAFFIC SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
THIS MIGHT BE THE TICKET, NO JOKING 
</P>

Choosing which traffic school to attend in Ventura County could drive you 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Scenario: You're a Ventura County resident minding your own business, doing 
nothing more than 75 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. zone, and they give you a traffic 
citation within the county. Fortunately, this is your first offense in a long 
time and you are eligible to attend traffic school to keep those insurance 
premiums down. 
</P>
<P>
Aren't you lucky! There are about 55 classrooms being operated by 17 
DMV-approved traffic violator schools in Ventura County. Fees vary from $18.99 
to $30, with day, evening and weekend sessions available. And what a variety of 
classes to choose from. There are the three community colleges, May Co., 
Comediane Plus-Learn From Us, California Traffic Schools, Lunch N Learn at Fine 
Restaurants, Cheap School, and Tri-County Traffic School, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, if you live in and were ticketed in Ventura County, there won't 
be any jugglers, hay rides, comedians or gourmet lunches in your future. With 
rare exceptions, all eligible violators opting for classes must attend 
Tri-County Traffic School. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ventura County residents ticketed outside the county may 
attend any state-licensed traffic school in California. Non-residents of the 
county have the same option, regardless of where in California the citation was 
received. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid problems. Read the explanation on your ticket or that courtesy notice 
that is generally mailed by the court. If you attend the wrong school, the 
court will not accept the certificate. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, a driver's insurance rates are usually increased if the fine is 
paid without traffic school, but that doesn't mean that completion of traffic 
school wipes the offending ticket off your record. It goes as an 'explained 
citation,' on their record," said Melody Jorgenson, office manager of 
Tri-County Traffic School. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-County is the only nonprofit, as well as the first and oldest traffic 
school in Ventura County. Originally named the "Conejo Valley Traffic Survival 
School," it was established in 1974 in Thousand Oaks by the Jaycees as a 
community service. The school is operated by paid coordinator Lt. Arnie 
Schwartz of Los Angeles CHP, and five volunteer board members. According to 
Sheila Gonzalez, supervisor of courts administrations at Ventura County 
Municipal Court, after meeting expenses, Tri-Valley puts money back into the 
community for driver's education and traffic safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-County has six locations in Ventura, Simi Valley, Westlake Village, and the 
main office in Thousand Oaks, which serve approximately 32,000 students 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Although in recent years the names and delivery style of schools have evolved, 
all operators and instructors must pass tests and be licensed by the DMV. Most 
instructors are associated with law enforcement or teaching, but a few are 
professional comedians. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Reck, an instructor in Santa Monica who served 28 years with the Los 
Angeles Police Department, says that almost any person could be "coached" to 
pass the comprehensive instructor's test, but an instructor needs experience in 
law enforcement to know traffic and the vehicle code. Reck says that humor in 
teaching is important but so is a knowledge of the law. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bill Gengler, spokesman for the DMV in Sacramento, a policy shift 
initiated by judges and public alike will soon require that approved traffic 
schools be listed by their state license numbers instead of their names. This 
practice is meant to eliminate advertising while it emphasizes the serious 
purpose of traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
For information on traffic court eligibility, call Ventura County Municipal 
Court-Traffic Division, Ventura office: 654-2611, between 9:30 a.m. and 11:30 
a.m. or 1:30 p.m. and 4 p.m.; Simi Valley branch: 584-4802 Ext. 4800.

FISHING NOTES: MARINA HALIBUT DERBY HOOKS 1,132 ANGLERS AND 300 FISH 
</P>

<P>
The Marina del Rey Halibut Derby was declared a success with more than 300 
brought to the scales. 
</P>
<P>
The 16th annual derby attracted 1,132 anglers. Sponsored by the Marina del Rey 
Anglers, the event allowed catches from either private or chartered boats. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 fish tagged by the Department of Fish and Game were hooked. The 
department paid $5 for each tagged catch. 
</P>
<P>
Top winner was Robert Loll of La Habra, who landed a 29-pound, 4-ounce 
specimen. He received a trip for two to fish the Great Barrier Reef in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Second place went to Steve John of Westminster who hooked a 25-pound, 3-ounce 
halibut. He won a fishing trip to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Rozsa of West Los Angeles finished third and was awarded fishing tackle 
for his catch of 24 pounds, 3 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
The derby banquet will be held April 5 at 7:30 p.m. at the Doubletree Marina 
Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Gear up for shallow rock cod fishing at San Nicolas Island. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth annual "Fishing For the Homeless" charity event is set for April 7 
aboard Capt. Russ Izor's boat, First String. According to organizer Tony Salas, 
last year's trip paid for more than 8,000 meals at the Los Angeles Rescue 
Mission. The cost for the event, which includes more than $1,000 in prizes and 
drawings, is $75 per angler. Call Salas at (818) 244-5348. 
</P>
<P>
Three Avalon siblings dropped their lines at Little Harbor while aboard their 
boat, May Time, and found plenty of action. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Kerr got a bite from a 40-pound sand shark just as his sister, Justine, 
hooked a 14-pound halibut. Meanwhile, brother Phil tossed a line baited with 
squid overboard and got an immediate tug from a 16-pound white sea bass. All 
three catches were landed. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hardcastle of San Pedro, fishing from a skiff outside the kelp beds near 
Pt. Fermin, caught a 10-pound halibut, then moved out to deeper water, tossing 
baited jigs in search of small calico bass. The fish refused to bite, so he 
removed the jig and inserted a hook with live squid. He reeled in a white sea 
bass that weighed just under 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Tom Honaker of Long Beach, fishing aboard the City of Seal 
Beach at the Oil Rigs, caught the whopper of the week, a 36-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The cows were out of the barn again last week. Sandy Bross of Redondo Beach, 
fishing aboard the Blackjack at the Cherry Bank, won the jackpot with a 
25-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
John Nance of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Toronado, caught a 19-pound 
cow cod at San Nicolas Island. 
</P>
<P>
And James Tani of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Southern Cal at Catalina 
Island, won the jackpot with a 19-pound cow. 
</P>
<P>
Fish reports: Local fishing is improving because anchovies are more available. 
Island boats using squid for bait report some barracudas have showed up. But 
most are refusing to take the bait. Anglers are making the maximum on cod 
fishing on most trips. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay during the halibut 
derby and had a count of 16 halibut, seven sole and 30 sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman took a half-day trip and anglers returned with 30 sand bass, 20 
sculpin and eight halibut. Two black sea bass were hooked and released. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O Special derby trip returned with 18 halibut. One black sea bass was 
hooked and released. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished the shallow rock cod reefs and 
chalked up 166 rock cod, 53 sculpin and a pair of lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack worked the Cherry Bank for 445 rock cod and 17 cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd St. Landing: The Freedom fished Catalina Island and sacked 230

fish, 24 sheephead and six lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Out on the Annie B. Barge the weekend total was 1,201 mackerel, 954 kingfish 
and four halibut. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Sportsfishing: The Victory checked out Huntington Flats and 
anglers sacked 1101 rock fish, 56 sand bass, 23 sculpin and three halibut.

JONES TOWERED ABOVE THE OPPOSITION WHEN IT MATTERED MOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to 
fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the 
observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will receive the 
traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate. 
</P>
<P>
The low point for Dana Jones, North Hollywood High's senior center, came Jan. 
17 at the Grant High gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
The area's top inside player scored all of six points against rival Grant in a 
48-46 loss as the Huskies fell to the less-talented Lancers for the second time 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Every time the 6-foot-6 Jones touched the ball, at least three Grant players -- 
all of whom stood at least three inches shorter -- collapsed on him. 
</P>
<P>
The frustrating defeat typified the North Hollywood season to that point. The 
Huskies dominated lesser opponents but fell short in big games. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the Grant loss, the Huskies suffered another indignity -- a 
65-55 overtime loss to Reseda that forced North Hollywood to share the 
Mid-Valley League title with the Regents. 
</P>
<P>
As the regular season concluded, Jones took a hard look at his season and liked 
little of what he saw. His numbers were impressive but unspectacular. 
</P>
<P>
He ranked among Valley leaders in scoring and rebounding and led area players 
in blocked shots, but he knew his performance had jeopardized his preseason 
goal of winning City Section Player of the Year honors in the 3-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good season but I needed a big effort in the playoffs to win it," he 
said last week. "I felt I needed to dominate every game in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of laying back like I did sometimes in the season, I went out and 
attacked." 
</P>
<P>
The effort paid off for both North Hollywood and Jones. The Huskies won the 3-A 
Division title, the school's first in basketball, and Jones earned the 
player-of-the-year award that he so coveted. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies avenged the two losses to Grant with an 85-69 win over the Lancers 
in the semifinals, then Jones all but clinched the player-of-the-year award 
with a 29-point, 29-rebound performance in a 76-71 upset of Fremont in the 
final at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood's playoff run ranked as the highlight of the boys' basketball 
season in the area, and, fittingly, Jones has been selected to The Times' 
All-Valley basketball team. He averaged 20.2 points, 14.9 rebounds and 5.4 
blocked shots for the Huskies (24-4). 
</P>
<P>
Ten players form an all-senior group from the 42 schools that field basketball 
teams in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland was The Times' top-ranked team in the area and reached the semifinals 
of the City 4-A playoffs. The Cavaliers (21-6) placed two players -- Eddie Hill 
and Bobby McRae -- on the All-Valley team. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' 10-player team features two representatives each from Hart and Van 
Nuys. Hart won its second consecutive Southern Section 5-A title behind the 
play of senior center Sara Wilson and sophomore point guard Anjanette Dionne. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the high drama of the season was centered in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of the team's success hinged on the play of Jones and his 
inspired performances in the playoffs, the real turning point might have come 
after an emotional team meeting just before the postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Miller, whose Fairfax teams won City titles in 1978 and 1979, 
subjected the team to two hours of psychological catharsis. He vented his 
frustrations about selfish play. The players, in turn, lashed out at each other 
and the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing changed after that," Miller said. "Since then, our whole focus 
was tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
As was the play of Jones. 
</P>
<P>
First-team players, their coaches and parents are invited to The Times' 
basketball awards brunch, scheduled for 9 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton.

PLAYER PROFILES 
</P>
<P>
Garret Anderson: Kennedy's top scorer led all Valley City Section players with 
a 23.1 average. The senior guard, who shared the North Valley League MVP award 
with Cleveland's Bobby McRae, is no stranger to the All-Valley team. Last year, 
he helped Kennedy to the City 4-A Division baseball title and was an All-Valley 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Baldwin: The West Valley League MVP specialized in buzzer beaters for 
San Fernando. He beat Kennedy in the final moments of a Northwest Valley 
Conference game and then moved the Tigers into the City 3-A semifinals when his 
follow of Michael Wynn's miss beat Reseda at the buzzer. Baldwin also was named 
to the All-City 3-A team. 
</P>
<P>
Jermoine Brantley: Granada Hills' point guard was arguably the area's top 
backcourt player. He averaged 20.2 points and led City players in the Valley 
with an average of 9.0 assists. The Highlanders finished a game behind 
Cleveland in the North Valley League, but Brantley led Granada Hills to an 
upset of top-ranked Cleveland. Brantley has narrowed his college choices to Cal 
State L. A. and Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Marnie Calderon: After years of languishing at the bottom of the Foothill 
League standings, Burroughs won back-to-back titles behind the scrappy 
leadership of Calderon. The senior point guard averaged 13.9 points and 4.6 
assists this season and was named the league MVP. An honors student, Calderon 
plans to study engineering in college, probably at the Coast Guard Academy. 
</P>
<P>
Gabe Higa: The area's third-leading scorer with a 23.2 average, Higa leaves 
Quartz Hill as the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,486 points. The 
senior forward also is the second-leading triple jumper in the state and ranks 
10th in the nation with a personal best of 48 feet 9 1/4 inches. He has signed 
to play basketball at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Hill: Cleveland's leading scorer with a 16.3 average will take his strong 
perimeter game to Washington State next season. In Cleveland's 91-90 overtime 
loss to Crenshaw in a City 4-A semifinal at the Sports Arena, he scored 12 of 
his team-high 24 points in the fourth quarter and made eight consecutive shots 
from the field in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Jones: After a solid but unspectacular regular season, Jones emerged in 
the playoffs as perhaps the area's top player. Jones, a repeat selection from 
'89, led North Hollywood to the City 3-A title with a 29-point, 29-rebound 
effort against Fremont. The senior center, who has signed with Pepperdine, was 
the City 3-A Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby McRae: North Valley League coaches were not fooled by McRae's modest 
scoring statistics. Despite a 9.3 average, he shared the league MVP award with 
Anderson. He was Cleveland's top inside defensive player and also was named MVP 
of the Hart tournament. After a late start in the spring, the 6-5 right-hander 
pitched a two-hitter in his baseball debut last week. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Osterloh: The Saracens' leading scorer this season leaves Harvard as the 
school's all-time leading scorer with 996 points. Still, basketball might be 
his second-best sport. He is a middle blocker for Harvard's volleyball team, 
whose winning streak in league play has topped 50. Stanford, UCLA and UC Santa 
Barbara head Osterloh's list of college preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Walters: The area's seventh-leading scorer with a 21.4 average, Walters 
led Antelope Valley to its second consecutive Golden League title and was named 
the league MVP. A solid student, he already has signed a letter to attend Texas 
El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
Karee Bonde: The senior guard led Palmdale to a Golden League title and seems a 
cinch to repeat as an All-Southern Section selection. She averaged 15.5 points 
and five rebounds and made 79% of her free throws. Her college preferences 
include Cal State Dominguez Hills and Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Corelli: Although Corelli played basketball for the first time this 
season, Alemany's sophomore guard was named the San Fernando Valley League MVP. 
She played on the varsity soccer team as a freshman, but after leading the 
Indians to their third consecutive league basketball title, she will be a 
fixture on the team the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Anjanette Dionne: Hart won its second consecutive Southern Section 5-A Division 
title as Dionne emerged as the area's top backcourt player. She averaged 23.3 
points and 5.0 assists and shared the Foothill League MVP award with teammate 
Sara Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Fischer: In her third season as a Notre Dame guard, Fischer was named the 
team MVP after averaging 12.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists. When she 
graduates this spring, Notre Dame will lose one if its most versatile athletes. 
She also has lettered in softball, track and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Kovar: The junior forward averaged 13.1 points, 14.4 rebounds and 2.8 
steals to lead Village Christian to a share of the Alpha League title. She is a 
three-year starter and has earned the team MVP award three times. Kovar also 
excels at softball and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Falicia Stanley: Kennedy's leading scorer is the only repeat selection from 
1989 besides Hart's Wilson. Stanley, a senior guard, averaged 21.2 points and 
9.8 rebounds and helped Kennedy extend its league winning streak to 136 games 
spanning 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Jacinda Sweet: North Hollywood's off-guard averaged 23.1 points and 10.9 
rebounds and set a school single-season record with 445 points. She was an 
All-City 4-A selection, and Coach Rich Allen says that college recruiters have 
tabbed her as one of the top juniors in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Huong Thai: The shortest player on the All-Valley team at 4-11, Thai played a 
key role in Van Nuys' drive to the City 4-A title game at the Sports Arena, 
where the Wolves lost to Washington. She averaged 7.9 points and 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Stacie Toon: The Mid-Valley League MVP formed a solid inside-outside threat 
with Thai. Toon, a senior center, averaged 19.4 points and 15.0 rebounds and 
led Van Nuys to a league title with a 10-0 record. Cal State Northridge ranks 
among her college preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Wilson: The Times' Valley Player of the Year a year ago entered her senior 
season as an All-American and did nothing to tarnish that honor. She averaged 
18.0 points and 11.3 rebounds, and, with Dionne, gave Hart the area's best 
one-two punch. Wilson already has signed with Oregon.

SANTA CLARA LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR DOUBT WITH PERFECT SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to 
fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the 
observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will receive the 
traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Suspect is the league and playoff schedule of the Santa Clara High boys' 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Respect is nonetheless what the Saints earned this season after posting their 
first unbeaten season in Lou Cvijanovich's 32 years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are many. 
</P>
<P>
* An overwhelming 41-point nonleague win over Simi Valley, a team that went on 
to win the Marmonte League co-championship and enter the Southern Section 5-AA 
Division playoffs with a 17-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
* A 16-point victory over Santa Barbara, a team that went on to win the Channel 
League co-championship and enter the 5-A playoffs with a 20-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
* A 23-point average margin of victory -- a spread that climbed to 24 in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
* A 52-game Frontier League winning streak that began in 1984 and a 45-game 
overall streak that includes a 28-0 record this season. 
</P>
<P>
* Shon Tarver, Santa Clara's All-American guard, was rivaled only by Artesia's 
Ed O'Bannon as the best player in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, Cvijanovich has been acknowledged as the county's premier coach for 
more than three decades. This season Cvijanovich, 63, won his 11th Southern 
Section basketball championship (he also has won two in football and one in 
baseball) and second consecutive state title. 
</P>
<P>
That the latest titles came in the Southern Section 2-AA and state Division IV 
does not diminish the accomplishments in the opinion of Santa Clara's boosters. 
</P>
<P>
Indicative of the program's success, they point out, is that four starters 
graduated from last year's team yet this year's group posted a better record. 
</P>
<P>
"People said they didn't think we'd even win the league," said Tarver, who 
joins Bruce Howarth as Santa Clara's representatives on The Times' All-Ventura 
County team. "They said all we had was me. I totally disagree. When we hear 
those kind of things, I'm glad they said it just so we could prove them wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect too much of a decline next season, despite the loss of Tarver and 
fellow starters Howarth and Anthony Zuiraitis. Starting forwards Anthony 
Maestes, a junior, and Chris Cole, a sophomore, return along with sixth man 
Steve Amar, a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cvijanovich said a year ago that "I'll coach until I drop dead," he 
has been cautioned by his physician that arthritic knees might force him to 
retire. The coach intends to continue as long as his health will allow, 
however. "I'm already planning for summer league," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among girls' teams, Ventura again could be a team to watch next season. The 
Lady Cougars, third in the Channel League, were the surprise of the county in 
the playoffs, advancing to the 4-AA final before falling to Muir. Ventura won 
its first Southern California regional playoff game before again falling to 
Muir. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Glenn Gray is excited about next year's team. Guards Cori Herman, a 
member of this year's 10-player all-county first team, and Denise Rea, a 
second-team selection, will be back along with forward Andrea Williams. 
</P>
<P>
As always, Buena will be a Channel League favorite under Coach Joe Vaughan. The 
Bulldogs were 26-0 this season before falling to Hart in the 5-A championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
First-team players, their coaches and parents are invited to The Times' 
basketball awards brunch, scheduled for 9 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton. 
Winners of awards for coach of the year and player of the year will be 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLAYER PROFILES 
</P>
<P>
Steve Carnes: A three-year varsity player at Simi Valley who was the last link 
to the Don MacLean era, Carnes played a key role as the Pioneers tied for the 
Marmonte League championship, the fifth year in a row they have either won or 
shared the title. Carnes, a guard, led Simi Valley in scoring (16.9) and 
assists (5.8) and he also averaged 4.0 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
David Harbour: A two-time All-Ventura County choice, the left-handed Harbour 
was a scoring machine, leading Camarillo with an average of 26.8 points and 
setting a single-game school record with 50. Harbour, an intense and 
intelligent guard who excels at every phase of the game, also led the Scorpions 
in rebounds (7.2) and assists (4.4). 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Howarth: A bench-warmer a year ago, Howarth emerged as another in a long 
line of hard-nosed Santa Clara point guards. Howarth, who led the Saints with 
7.3 assists, controlled the offensive tempo, rarely committed turnovers and was 
a fierce defender. He also complemented Shon Tarver, the Saints' All-American 
off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Loll: A left-handed shooter with a feathery touch, Loll did more than 
score, leading Thousand Oaks in rebounds (7.1), assists (3.0), steals (1.4) and 
blocked shots (1.8). Loll, a forward who also led the Lancers in scoring 
(15.6), made a game-winning field goal in an upset of Westlake and the decisive 
free throws in an upset of Royal. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Myers: A physical forward whose quick first step enables him to 
penetrate defenses, Myers led Royal to a share of its first Marmonte League 
title since 1971. Myers, who overcame an early-season bout with mononucleosis 
to average 24.3 points and 5.9 rebounds, scored a school-record 45 points in 
one game. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Oliver: A two-time All-Ventura County selection, Oliver tied MacLean's 
single-game county scoring record with a 52-point effort against Loyola. 
Oliver, a guard who will attend Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, was second in the 
county in scoring with 28.4 points a game. He also led Buena in assists (6.7 
avg.). 
</P>
<P>
Mike Spears: A dominant force at center, Spears was the leading rebounder in 
the county (12.2 avg.). Spears, who set Hueneme records for rebounds in a 
career and in a season, also averaged a school-record 3.7 blocked shots. 
Opponents routinely double-teamed Spears, yet he still managed to average 18.1 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Shon Tarver: An All-American and two-time state Division IV Player of the Year, 
Tarver is said by many to be the finest player to come out of Ventura County. 
Tarver, a guard, led Santa Clara to an unbeaten season and a second consecutive 
Division IV championship by averaging 9.2 rebounds and a county-high 31.6 
points and 4.0 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Thomas: A three-time All-Ventura County player, Thomas led Rio Mesa to the 
third round of the Southern Section 4-A playoffs this season. Thomas, a forward 
who will attend New Mexico, averaged a team-high 20.4 points, 9.3 rebounds and 
2.5 blocked shots a game. Thomas is the only four-time All-Channel League 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wawryk: A strong leader as well as an intimidating force at center, Wawryk 
led Simi Valley in rebounding (8.3) and was second on the team in scoring. Simi 
Valley won a share of the Marmonte League title largely because Wawryk emerged 
as the league's most dominant inside player. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
Susanne Carey: One of only two 6-footers on the All-Ventura County team, Carey 
made a successful transition from center to shooting guard. Carey, who will 
attend Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, averaged 13.6 rebounds and 15.6 points in 
helping St. Bonaventure win the Tri-Valley League championship. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Ellis: The Buena center showed tremendous dedication in coming back from 
a severe knee injury that sidelined her most of last season. Ellis led the 
Bulldogs, who reached the Southern Section 5-A final, in rebounding (8.2) and 
blocked shots (1.8). 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Gische: An intelligent and versatile player, Gische averaged 16.7 
points and 8.4 rebounds a game in helping Westlake take a share of the Marmonte 
League championship. Gische, a forward, is a deadly perimeter shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Cori Herman: Ventura enjoyed a Cinderella season, advancing to the Southern 
Section 4-AA final and winning a state regional game, largely because of the 
play of Herman. The savvy guard led the team in scoring (16.8) and rebounding 
(6.8). 
</P>
<P>
Dani O'Byrne: An excellent ball-handler and defensive player, O'Byrne also led 
Westlake in scoring (17.1) and assists (4.3). Alternating between guard and 
forward, O'Byrne was assigned to cover each opponent's top offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
Mia Palkie: An unselfish player who fits nicely into Buena's team concept, 
Palkie has just scratched her potential. Palkie, a forward, averaged 11.4 
points and 5.5 rebounds in helping the Bulldogs begin the season with 26 wins 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Palmisano: A player with tremendous scoring range, Palmisano was the 
leading scorer in the county with a 29.6 average. The Thousand Oaks guard, who 
also had 262 rebounds and 122 assists, will be watched closely by Division I 
schools over the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Tauau: The county's most dominant force in the key, Tauau led Channel 
Islands to a share of the Marmonte League championship. Tauau, a physically 
imposing 6-foot center, averaged 12.5 rebounds, 11.2 points and 2.8 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Nichole Victoria: At 5-6 the shortest player on the All-Ventura County team, 
Victoria is also the most prolific scorer in county history with a career total 
of 1,927 points. Victoria averaged 22.8 points, 6.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists 
for Camarillo this season. 
</P>
<P>
Edith Young: In Coach Callie Gibson's last season, Hueneme posted a 14-11 
record largely because of the expert ballhandling and defense of Young. The 
point guard averaged 13.0 points, 8.1 rebounds and 6.2 assists a game.

MORNING REPORT: POST-OSCAR GLOW BOOSTS 'FIELD OF DREAMS'

"Field of Dreams" -- No. 2 on the Billboard rental chart -- didn't win the 
best-picture Oscar but it still has fully capitalized on its nomination. Of the 
five nominees, it was the only one released in the rental market in time to 
take advantage of the pre-Oscar publicity. 
</P>
<P>
It probably will climb into the No. 1 spot soon, not only because it will still 
be basking in the post-Oscar glow but also because its baseball theme ties in 
with the opening of the baseball season. Meanwhile, "Breaking In," the 
low-budget, critically acclaimed movie starring Burt Reynolds, is doing 
surprisingly well (No. 19) in the rental market for a movie that did very 
little box-office business. "Little Monsters," starring Fred Savage, debuted at 
No. 22. 
</P>
<P>
* In its second week on the chart, "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," the 
comedy/fantasy starring Rick Moranis, vaulted from No. 37 to No. 8. The only 
thing that can keep this blockbuster (theatrical gross: more than $130 million) 
out of No. 1 is a very strong rental-market performance by "Field of Dreams."

PASADENA'S MAYOR URGES AID FOR YOUTHS IN STATE OF CITY TALK

Mayor William Thomson Jr., focusing on the city's urban poor in the annual 
State of the City speech, suggested a "rethinking and a restructuring" of city 
programs to aid youths living in north central and northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience of about 200 at the Pasadena Center, Thomson asked for 
an expansion of the Police Department youth adviser program, improvements in 
the quality of after-school programs, the hiring of a chil dren's program 
coordinator and creation of a trust fund to provide money to keep at-risk 
youths in school. 
</P>
<P>
"If the United States as a whole does not solve the continuing unemployment, 
illiteracy, frustration and hopelessness which exists in our central cities, I 
see little hope for controlling, much less eliminating, the problems that 
plague us," Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
Elected in 1981, Thomson was chosen by the Board of Directors to serve as mayor 
two years in a row. He turns over the gavel to Director Jess Hughston in May. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he summarized accomplishments during his mayoral stint, such as the 
opening of the Doubletree Hotel and the One Colorado shopping center 
groundbreaking. Then he turned to changes in city programs that would aid 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the changes would have little cost to the city, which is 
struggling to bridge a $5-million gap between estimated revenues and proposed 
spending for next year. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said the job of children's program coordinator, such as in Long Beach, 
could be budgeted for as little as $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The coordinator would "not have to reinvent the wheel," he said, but could 
model Pasadena's programs after a youth trust program in Minneapolis with two 
components. The first component, a buddy system, puts volunteers to work as 
friends, mentors, tutors or recreational leaders. The second, a job connection 
program, provides internships and job referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena could staff the new programs with the volunteer labor of hundreds of 
seniors, Thomson said, adding that the heads of the city's Senior Commission 
and Commission on Children and Youth support the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trust fund could begin with a city donation of $25,000 yearly to 
be matched by contributions from the school district and private businesses, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the total answer but it's a beginning," he said of the trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on the future of the city's children and youth comes not only from 
his interest in children, Thomson said, but also from a report issued last year 
by the Commission on Children and Youth that brought directors "face to face 
with certain realities." 
</P>
<P>
Citing the report, Thomson said that more than 55% of the city's population 
under 17 lives in eight census tracts in the northwest and center of the city, 
an area with the weakest economy and lowest household and per-capita income. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 9,000 children from that area attending public schools, 44% qualify for 
subsidized lunches and 5,500 are in families supported by county funds from Aid 
to Families with Dependent Children, Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the school dropout rate in Pasadena exceeds 28% and that 11% 
of the children born in Huntington Memorial Hospital have mothers addicted to 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the point is well made that we need creative action to 
address a problem of crisis proportions," Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's response in the past has been primarily from law enforcement, he 
said, such as the city's 20 Police Department youth advisers who counsel their 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also taking other enforcement measures such as an existing 
moratorium on convenience stores that sell alcohol and the instituting of 
alcohol-free games at the Rose Bowl during this fall's UCLA season. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomson added that "law enforcement can't provide jobs, education or hope 
where there is none." 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he stressed that the fight against drugs is a spiritual issue 
that the city's churches and synagogues will emphasize this weekend. He also 
said planning is under way for a weeklong program in the fall that will 
"publicly address the spiritual issues that contribute to the drug problems of 
this community and our nation."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
To Fund Committees 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 349 to 71, the House approved a partial committee budget for 1990 
of $56.8 million, up 4.8% over the comparable 1989 authorization and 10.5% over 
actual spending last year. The measure (HR 346) will fund about half the cost 
of the House's about 180 committees and subcommittees, with the remainder 
supplied by separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) called the budget "conservative and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) objected to "an increase that is twice the 
level of . . . inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the committee funding.

Rural Development 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 360 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3581) 
delivering federal aid to depressed rural areas. At an estimated cost of more 
than $2 billion over five years, the bill starts new programs, realigns current 
ones and gives states more voice in funding decisions. It shifts certain 
programs from the Farmers Home Administration to a new Rural Development 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also expands the Rural Electrification Administration, eases repayment 
terms of REA and other rural loans and channels aid to communities hurt by 
curbs on timbering in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Flag Issue 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 309 to 101 to withdraw from the U. S. Supreme Court its brief 
for the 1989 law making it a crime to desecrate the American flag. This vote on 
HR 362 was a victory for Republicans who would rather protect the flag by 
constitutional amendment. They objected that the Democratic-approved brief 
asked the court to rule on the flag law in the term beginning in October. They 
saw this as a delaying tactic by Democrats who want to preserve the statute. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer this House . . . tries to bottle up the statute in the Supreme 
Court, the longer the flag goes unprotected," said James F. Sensenbrenner Jr. 
(R-Wis). 
</P>
<P>
Craig Washington (D-Tex.) said "the cheapest trick of all" is to embroil the 
flag in partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the flag brief withdrawn from the Supreme Court.

PUTTING IT POLITELY, THIS CAMPAIGN SEEMS CIVIL

<P>
All's quiet on the campaign front. 
</P>
<P>
Though other San Gabriel Valley cities may greet the election season with 
political bickering and hot debates, Rosemead has not even scheduled a 
candidates' forum. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a bedroom community, and we like to keep it that way," Councilman Gary 
Taylor said. "The more peaceful and quiet, the better." 
</P>
<P>
So although three candidates are competing for two City Council seats in the 
April 10 election, a polite atmosphere prevails. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 49, is seeking reelection, as is Mayor Dennis McDonald. Challenger 
Frank Villar, who might be expected to attack the status quo, is unfailingly 
civil. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the council is doing a bad job, but I do think they need fresh 
ideas and new blood," Villar said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the gentility, a few positions have emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a construction supervisor who has been on the council for 16 years, 
three as mayor, said his biggest concern is making sure redevelopment projects 
don't get in the way of private homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to continue watching homeowners' rights," Taylor said. "We are a fully 
developed city, and I want to make sure residents keep control of their 
property without others taking over." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, 47, fire marshal for El Monte, has been on the council since 1987, 
serving as mayor for the last year. He said he will continue working on plans 
to create a community center with low-income housing for senior citizens. He 
also says Valley Boulevard needs more landscaping and business parking. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the incumbents point to their experience, challenger Villar, account 
manager for Ambassador Sales Co., said he represents a "new vision." Villar, 
who has served on the Temple City Recreation and Parks Commission for 14 years, 
said his main concern is providing programs for young people, "to get them off 
the streets and away from gang activity." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see a multipurpose center for boys and girls that would include arts 
and crafts classes, sports classes, counseling -- all in one place," said 
Villar, who refuses to specify his age, saying only that he is in his 50s. 
</P>
<P>
The top finishers on April 10 win four-year terms on the council, which 
annually elects the mayor from among its five members.

LYNWOOD'S HIGH-SCORING KILLUM LEADS SOUTHEAST PREP BOYS ALL-STAR TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unstoppable is perhaps the best way to describe Lynwood High School's Earnest 
Killum, the top scorer on the 1990 Times All-Southeast prep basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Combining his ability to shoot from outside, drive to the basket and leap, the 
6-foot-4 1/2 Killum averaged 30 points and 7.5 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
He played in 60 varsity games in two years under Coach Bill Notley and was 
never held under 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Heavily recruited by colleges and universities, he is considering Oklahoma, 
Oregon State, Nevada-Las Vegas and Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second consecutive year that Killum has made The Times' all-star 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at the rest of the All-Southeast team, which includes three 
juniors and a sophomore: 
</P>
<P>
Juaquin Hawkins, Lynwood -- A 6-5 junior, Hawkins averaged 11 points and 9.5 
rebounds. "He has shown flashes of brilliance," Lynwood Coach Notley said. 
"Once he becomes consistent, he will be an outstanding player." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Day, Cerritos -- Day, a 6-foot senior, averaged 18 points and 5 assists, 
and shot 46% from three-point range. He had a high game of 34 points and was 
All-San Gabriel Valley League. "We relied on him for leadership and ball 
handling," Cerritos Coach Jim Chapel said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Flick, Cerritos -- A good rebounder who can handle the ball, the 6-7 
Flick, a junior, averaged 15 points and 7.5 rebounds. Like Day, he was 
all-league. "He will lead the team next year," Chapel said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Titus, Gahr -- A 6-3 sophomore, Titus is a "legitimate gym rat," 
according to Gahr Coach Vern Stewart. "He will be very good because he loves 
the game so much," Stewart said. Titus averaged 17.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4 
assists. Confidence is one of his best assets. 
</P>
<P>
Paul White, California -- A three-year varsity player, the 6-8 White averaged 
21 points, 16.5 rebounds and 7 blocked shots. "He has leadership on and off the 
court," California Coach Paul Turley said. "He dominated from every 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Oronoz, Whittier Christian -- "He allowed us to limit teams to one shot 
because he dominated the defensive boards," Whittier Christian Coach Bob Brown 
said of the 6-5 junior, who averaged 17 points and 10 rebounds. Oronoz can 
score from inside or outside. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Sybesma, Valley Christian -- This quick, 6-2 senior guard had averages of 
17 points, 3 assists and 3 steals. "His composure made him a great player," 
Crusaders Coach Harold DeBie said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Beck, Brethren -- The hard-working Beck led the Warriors into the 
playoffs. A 6-2 senior, he averaged 10 points, 5.6 rebounds and 6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Pietsch, La Mirada -- The 6-8 senior was the Matadores' best all-around 
player, averaging 15.4 points and 7 rebounds. He played outside early in the 
season, then switched inside when the Suburban League started. He has a 3.75 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Southeast all-star boys and girls teams, each consisting of 10 members, 
their coaches and parents, will be guests of The Times at 9 a.m. Sunday at the 
Anaheim Hilton for the annual Times High School Basketball Awards Brunch. 
All-star teams from 12 circulation areas will be honored and the players and 
coaches of the year from each area will be announced. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who were asked to 
fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the 
observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will receive the 
traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate.

<P>
The all-star boys and girls teams, each consisting of 10 members, their coaches 
and parents will be guests of the Times at 9 a.m. Sunday, April 1, at the 
annual Times High School Basketball Awards Brunch where all-star teams from 12 
circulation areas will be honored at the Anaheim Hilton. The players and 
coaches of the year from each area will be announced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to 
fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the 
observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will receive the 
traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Good things came in pairs for the boys basketball teams at Pasadena and West 
Covina high schools this season. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams enjoyed outstanding seasons and landed two players each on the 1990 
Los Angeles Times All-San Gabriel Valley All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, which reached the CIF Southern Section 5-A Division semifinals for 
the second straight season, before losing to powerful Loyola 77-71 and 
finishing with a 23-6 record, placed center Todd Lewis (6-7) and guard Don 
Mitchell (6-3) on the team. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina, which won the Sierra League title before being upset by Victor 
Valley in the first round of the 5-A Division playoffs and posted a 19-7 
record, is represented by guard Clyde Jordan (6-6) and forward Sherrod Belton 
(6-4). 
</P>
<P>
The other six members of the 10-player squad are guard Hung Duong (5-8) of 
Alhambra, forward Jason Green (6-4) of Bishop Amat, forward-center Johnny 
McWilliams (6-6) of Pomona, guard Kevin Morrison (6-2) of Damien, forward Matt 
Schuler (6-2) of Nogales and swingman Corey Smith (6-2) of Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams is the only junior. There are no repeaters from last year's team. 
</P>
<P>
Belton is not even the most actively recruited player on his West Covina team. 
But Sierra League coaches were impressed enough to select him as the league's 
most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Strong underneath the basket, Belton averaged 18 points and 10 rebounds to lead 
his team in both departments. He has been recruited by NCAA Division I schools 
including UC Irvine and New Mexico State and Division II programs at Cal State 
Bakersfield and Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Pound-for-pound, there probably was not a better player in the valley than 
Duong. How many other 5-8 guards can say they averaged 25.5 points, 6.5 
rebounds, four steals and three assists? 
</P>
<P>
He was also the team's top defensive player and carries a 3.73 grade-point 
average. A first-team All-Foothill League selection, he barely missed earning 
league most valuable player honors but earned the MVP award at all three 
regular-season tournaments he competed in during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Duong, who hasn't attracted interest from major colleges because of his size, 
has been recruited by Division II Cal Poly Pomona and Division III Occidental, 
Whittier and La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
If the name Jason Green sounds familiar, it may be because he was also selected 
to The Times All-San Gabriel Valley squad as a tight end in football last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-4 and 200 pounds, Green was a prep All-America selection in football and 
has signed a national letter of intent to attend UCLA in the fall. But he has 
also proven his ability on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, he averaged 21 points and 10 rebounds and made the All-Sierra 
League first team while sparking Bishop Amat to a 17-11 record and the 4-AA 
quarterfinals. In his junior year, he averaged 22 points and 10 rebounds and 
earned All-CIF Division II second team honors. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is not a prolific scorer by any means but may be one of the most 
versatile players in the valley. A player with the size and skill to play point 
guard, off guard and small forward, he averaged 17.5 points, nine rebounds, six 
assists and four steals as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time All-Sierra League selection, regarded as one of the top college 
prospects in the valley, Jordan has been recruited by Division I schools Oregon 
State, Oregon, Cal State Long Beach and Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena has attracted more notice for its outstanding guards in recent seasons 
but the 6-7 Lewis was the center of attention for the Bulldogs this season. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best front-line players in the valley, Lewis led the Bulldogs by 
averaging 17.7 points and 11.7 rebounds. That earned him the most valuable 
player award in the Pacific League and his team's "Chairman of the Boards" 
award. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams, a junior, may be the most heavily recruited player in the valley. 
He has been contacted by many of the top Division I programs in the nation, 
including Nevada-Las Vegas, Syracuse and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Selected as one of the top underclassmen in the nation by Street and Smith, 
McWilliams established his reputation as a sophomore by averaging 24.2 points 
and 12.2 rebounds and making the All-CIF Division III team. 
</P>
<P>
He displayed his versatility as a junior by averaging 23.5 points, 13.5 
rebounds, 6.2 assists and 3.6 steals to lead Pomona to a 20-7 record and the 
second round of the 3-AA playoffs. He also made All-Montview League for the 
second straight season. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is the latest on a long list of outstanding guards for Pasadena. A 
three-year starter for the Bulldogs, Mitchell averaged 14 points in earning 
All-CIF Division I second team honors as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
A swingman as a senior, Mitchell averaged 15.5 points, 5.5 rebounds and three 
assists in making the All-Pacific League first team for the second year in a 
row. He has been recruited by Division I schools, but is undecided about 
college. 
</P>
<P>
In a good year for guards in the valley, Morrison also ranks among the best. A 
prolific outside shooter who made 83 three-pointers as a senior, Morrison 
averaged 21.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and three assists to carry Damien to a 17-10 
record and the 5-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time All-Baseline League selection, Morrison was voted co-most valuable 
player. He has also been recruited by many major colleges, including Santa 
Clara, Oregon, Washington State and St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not receive the most valuable player trophy in the Sierra 
League, Schuler was described as the "best athlete in our league" by one 
opposing coach and was the leading vote-getter in the valley in balloting by 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season as a starter for Nogales, Schuler averaged 19.5 points, 6.3 
rebounds and 4.2 assists to earn selection to the all-league first team. 
</P>
<P>
He led a surprising Nogales team, which did not return a starter from the 
previous season, to a 21-6 record and a 5-AA playoff berth. Among the colleges 
recruiting him are Humboldt State and Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the graduation of Tracy Murray, the all-time leading scorer in the 
state who started as a freshman this season at UCLA, Glendora rebounded to win 
its first-ever Southern Section title with a 64-58 victory over Compton in the 
4-AA final. One of the biggest factors was the play of Smith. 
</P>
<P>
As a swingman for the Tartans, who finished at 28-6 and reached the state 
Division II regional final, Smith averaged a team-leading 14 points, six 
rebounds and 4.9 assists and was co-most valuable player of the Baseline 
League. He has been recruited by Azusa Pacific, Fresno Pacific and La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Players receiving honorable mention are LaDay Smith and Phillip Turner of Muir, 
Ray Maberry of Pasadena, Damien Hyams of Diamond Bar, Lord Nobles of Azusa, 
Mike Parisi of Arcadia, Eric Wattree of Northview, Kevin Brown of Wilson, Mike 
Allen of Los Altos and Anthony Calvillo of La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
Others are Greg Alley of San Dimas, Blair Slattery of San Marino, Sam Love and 
Owen Thomas of Walnut, J.J. O'Laughlin of Glendora, Damon Boykin of Ganesha, 
Cassie Hough of Bassett, Chris Bruce of Western Christian and Eric Brown of 
Workman.

CAL POLY'S DARLENE MAY NAMED DIVISION II BASKETBALL COACH OF YEAR FOR 2ND TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darlene May, longtime coach of the Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team who 
guided the Broncos to a 29-4 record this season, has been named 1990 Converse 
NCAA Division II Coach of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of May marks the second time in the last three seasons that she 
has received the honor. She is only the second coach, along with Jorga Hoehn of 
Central Missouri State, to receive the award twice. 
</P>
<P>
May guided the Broncos to the Division II final four tournament for the seventh 
time since the division was formed for the 1981-82 season. The Broncos finished 
third with an 87-68 victory over Oakland of Michigan after suffering a 67-53 
setback to eventual champion Delta State of Mississippi in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In her team's previous appearances in the final four tournament, the Broncos 
won three national titles and finished second three times. May, who has coached 
the Broncos for 16 years, has the most wins in Division II history with a 
career record of 426-95 for a winning percentage of .814. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has also won an unprecedented nine straight California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. titles under May and she has an all-time conference record of 
154-5. 
</P>
<P>
For the second season in a row, center Niki Bracken of Cal Poly Pomona has been 
selected to the Kodak NCAA Division II All-America women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-2 senior, Bracken completed her career as the school's all-time scoring 
leader. She holds school records of 44 points in a game, 619 points in a season 
and 2,246 points in her career. Bracken also moved into second place all-time 
in career rebounds with 1,053. 
</P>
<P>
In her final season with the Broncos, she averaged a team-leading 18.6 points 
and 9.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken also became the first player in Division II history to be chosen to the 
division all-tournament team for the third time last week. In two games in the 
final four tournament last week in Pomona, she scored 27 points and grabbed 14 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The women's softball team at Cal Poly Pomona will try to rebound from a 
disappointing showing at the Cal State Fullerton PONY Softball Invitational 
Tournament when it hosts San Jose State in a Big West Conference double header 
at 1:30 p.m. Friday in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, ranked No. 10 in the NCAA Division I, enter the double header with 
an 18-17 overall record, 2-6 in Big West play. Pomona split a pair of 
conference games with Pacific on Monday, winning 1-0 before dropping a 7-1 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Pomona pitchers Bonnie Ebenkamp and Nicky Luce combined to 
toss a five-hit shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Last week at the PONY tournament, the Broncos won only two of six games. The 
wins were against Oregon State, 5-2, and United States International 
University, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Junior defender Paige Durivage of South Pasadena High, who helped lead her team 
to the CIF Southern Section 2-A Division title, has been named the division's 
defensive player of the year in girls soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Her coach, Bob Mendoza, was selected 2-A coach of the year and Temple City 
freshman forward Erin Martin was chosen as offensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena, which won the title with a 2-1 victory over Diamond Bar, also 
placed junior midfielder Stacey Hoshimiya, sophomore defender Amy Kloss, junior 
goalkeeper Joanne Vanderwall, senior forward Rachel Wackerman and junior 
forward Cassie Zappaterreno on the first team. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City also landed senior forward Renae Scott and senior midfielder 
Jennifer Woolery on the first team. 
</P>
<P>
In 4-A, Arcadia and St. Lucy's of Glendora each placed one player on the first 
team, senior midfielders Collette Connors of Arcadia and Shelly O'Brien of St. 
Lucy's. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1-A, division champion Mayfield of Pasadena was represented on the first 
team by junior forward Molly Lynch. The Cubs won the title with a 3-2 win over 
Brentwood in the final match. Lynch scored all three of her team's goals. 
Westridge of Pasadena also placed sophomore defender Laura Kaufman on the first 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Former Keppel High School Coach Harold George is recruiting graduating seniors 
from the San Gabriel Valley to compete in a California vs. Oklahoma prep 
all-star football game June 22 at St. Louis High in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The coach also needs cheerleaders for the trip, which will run from June 21-26. 
Cost of the trip is $725 including hotel accommodations, air fare and meals.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Fund Committees 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 349 to 71, the House approved a partial committee budget for 1990 
of $56.8 million, up 4.8% over the comparable 1989 authorization and 10.5% over 
actual spending last year. The measure (HR 346) will fund about half the cost 
of the House's approximately 180 committees and subcommittees, with the 
remainder supplied by separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) called the budget "conservative and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) objected to "an increase (of 10.5%) that is 
twice the level of . . . inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the committee funding.

Rural Development 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 360 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3581) 
delivering federal aid to depressed rural areas. At an estimated cost of more 
than $2 billion over five years, the bill starts new programs, realigns current 
ones and gives states more voice in funding decisions. It shifts certain 
programs from the Farmers Home Administration to a new Rural Development 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also expands the Rural Electrification Administration, eases repayment 
terms of REA and other rural loans and channels aid to communities hurt by 
curbs on timbering in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Flag Issue 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 309 to 101 to withdraw from the U. S. Supreme Court its brief 
for the 1989 law making it a crime to desecrate the American flag. This vote on 
HR 362 was a victory for Republicans who would rather protect the flag by 
constitutional amendment. They objected that the Democratic-approved brief 
asked the court to rule on the flag law in the term beginning in October. They 
saw this as a delaying tactic by Democrats who want to preserve the statute. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer this House . . . tries to bottle up the statute in the Supreme 
Court, the longer the flag goes unprotected," said James F. Sensenbrenner Jr. 
(R-Wis). 
</P>
<P>
Craig Washington (D-Tex.) said "the cheapest trick of all" is to embroil the 
flag in partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the flag brief withdrawn from the Supreme Court.

THANKS, J.I.: Historians say Eddie Martin (B1) created the airport business in 
Orange County, but Eddie Martin always said it was James Irvine of the Irvine 
Ranch. . . . During the Depression, when Martin's landing strip had become a 
sophisticated airport far behind in its rent, Irvine forgave the debt and 
reduced the rent. . . . Finally, when the county overlaid the airport with a 
road, Irvine persuaded county supervisors to give Martin an exclusive lease at 
its new airport. "When Eddie talked about James Irvine, it sounded like he was 
talking about God," said a friend. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

BAD REVIEWS: Three Orange County congressmen -- Reps. Dannemeyer, Dornan and 
Rohrabacher -- were the subject Wednesday of the nationally syndicated 
Washington column written by Jack Anderson and Dale Van Atta. . . . The three 
"are beginning to make nuisances of themselves," the writers said. . . . "Their 
specialty is moral outrage" and "their pushy style robs them of the credibility 
it takes to wield power." And while they're popular at home, "the trio often 
flops in Washington." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

SUITE: The Newport Beach Four Seasons Hotel picked up the tab for Nancy 
Reagan's one-night stay in the Presidential Suite before her visit here 
Wednesday (B2). . . . The last First Family member to stay there? 
President-elect George Bush in November, 1988. For the rest of us, the suite 
goes for $1,700 a night. . . . Nancy got a complimentary arrangement of white 
tuber roses from the management but no mini bar or mint on the pillow. And 
check out time is "always flexible," says the hotel's Cathy Weiss. Mark I.

DOING A GOOD TURN; 
</P>
<P>
CREWS LAY TILE HOMES FOR ENDANGERED LEAST TERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carrying a red clay tile that looked as if it belonged on an Irvine roof, 
Elizabeth McBride looked for a bare spot on a sandy island in the Bolsa Chica 
Ecological Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
McBride and six colleagues from the California Conservation Corps roamed the 
wildlife refuge on Wednesday, searching for spots to place the tiles that the 
endangered least tern will use to shelter its chicks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to see where another good place for a house might be," said 
McBride, 21, of Los Angeles. "I was just thinking, 'If I were a bird, where 
would I want to live?' " 
</P>
<P>
The work of the Conservation Corps members is part of an effort to protect the 
California least tern, a tiny gull-like bird that migrates from Central and 
South America and is expected to arrive at the reserve in about two weeks. "The 
Bolsa Chica area breeds 50% of least terns left on the face of this Earth," 
said Curt Taucher, a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Game. 
"If we let that get away from us, we won't have any terns left." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are encouraging California taxpayers to make a donation for 
endangered species such as the least tern on state tax forms. About $910,000 
was raised through this campaign last year to benefit rare, threatened and 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
As a flock of sandpipers waded in the nearby marsh, Conservation Corps workers 
scanned the ground, stepping lightly to avoid crushing the nests of other birds 
and scouting spots for tiles. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most of the hand-picked team of workers didn't know what a least 
tern was before this assignment, they enthusiastically installed the artificial 
nests for the gray-and-white terns. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel all the animals should be able to live," said Robert Bolton, 19, of Los 
Angeles. "They have the same right we do." 
</P>
<P>
Chrystie Clark said she had helped clean up oil that washed up on beaches after 
the American Trader spill. She recalled seeing the rescue of an oil-coated 
gull. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I could come out here again," said Clark, 20, of Pleasanton, Calif. 
"You want to do something for (the birds) besides clean up what a human did." 
</P>
<P>
Nature used to take care of sheltering the birds, providing driftwood in which 
fledgling least terns could hide from natural predators such as sparrow hawks, 
crows and red foxes. But the tern is not doing well in its competition with 
humans for open space. 
</P>
<P>
"These birds nest traditionally on bare sand beaches," said Charles Collins, a 
Cal State Long Beach biology professor who specializes in ornithology. "And 
since there's competition for space on the beach for a small bird and lots of 
humans, birds tend to lose out." 
</P>
<P>
After the volunteers finished laying down the tiles on the reserve's northern 
island, they set out for an island to the south, where they cleared land for 
bird nesting. 
</P>
<P>
The effort might seem like a lot of effort for a bird that weighs about 45 
grams when it reaches maturity, but wildlife biologists such as Esther Burkett 
say the endangered species must be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
"If the least tern were to disappear, the world wouldn't necessarily stop," 
Burkett said. "(But) at some point, we will lose too many species. You start 
losing one and there are repercussions that start going down the food chain."

POLICE ARREST SUSPECT IN BANK ROBBERY

<P>
Anaheim police Wednesday arrested a 33-year-old Santa Ana man suspected of 
robbing the Southern California Bank in Placentia just after 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
John Roybal was arrested after a short chase through an Anaheim apartment 
complex in the 500 block of North Olive Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia Sgt. Russ Rice said some money was recovered at the site of the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Police and FBI agents handling the case would not disclose the amount of money 
stolen or recovered. No weapon was used during the robbery, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal was arrested about 20 minutes after a bank teller told police that a 
heavyset man with a mustache repeatedly demanded all of the teller's money, FBI 
spokesman Fred Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's police helicopter spotted a green van that was believed to be the 
getaway vehicle and began a short chase, Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said. Roybal got out 
of the van and ran through the apartment complex, where he was arrested, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal was being held Wednesday afternoon in the Placentia City Jail. TOM

METER FEEDING TO STOP AT 6 P.M. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial decision to extend the running time on some Newport Beach 
parking meters until 10 p.m. has been modified by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, it will not be necessary to feed meters citywide past 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the city had extended the shut off-time for meters from 5 p.m. to 
either 6 or 10 p.m., depending on the area of town, to generate revenue for law 
enforcement and litter control. 
</P>
<P>
However, the action angered some merchants and customers who said it was 
difficult to read the meter instructions after dark and that the extended meter 
times hurt business. Some residents were annoyed that visitors in their homes 
would have to feed parking meters, said Rich Edmonston, city traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
City workers will be finished changing the meters by the end of the week.

NANCY REAGAN TELLS OF CANCER EPISODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were, to be sure, glimpses of the strong, independent-minded woman who 
liked to take jabs at the Washington establishment during her tumultuous eight 
years in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
But by and large, it was a different and seemingly more vulnerable side of 
Nancy Reagan that was on display before some 560 supportive women in Newport 
Beach on Wednesday as the former First Lady shared her experience with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt my stomach start to tighten," Mrs. Reagan said, relating the day in 
1985 when the doctor closed the examination room door to tell her the results 
of a routine mammogram. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew -- I could feel the bad news coming, and there was no way to stop it," 
she said. "I thought -- 'Ronnie, what would he do?' " 
</P>
<P>
After her speech at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mrs. Reagan went to Hoag Hospital 
in Newport Beach to meet with more than two dozen cancer patients. She received 
some flowers, looked at a few scrapbooks and, for the most part, listened to 
the stories of the patients. 
</P>
<P>
But at a morning brunch organized by the Circle 1000 Club, an association of 
Orange County women that is raising funds for the soon-to-open, $22-million 
Hoag Cancer Center, it was Mrs. Reagan doing most of the talking. Met with a 
standing ovation, Mrs. Reagan said that after learning of her breast cancer, 
she rejected the option of a lumpectomy -- to remove only the cancerous tissue 
itself -- and instead decided on a radical mastectomy to remove the left 
breast. 
</P>
<P>
It was a decision that prompted some public criticism from medical 
professionals and others in Washington at the time, and Mrs. Reagan said that 
stung. 
</P>
<P>
"What right did they have to tell me I'd made the wrong decision?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
She defended her decision, saying: "I wasn't 20 years old, I'd been married for 
38 years and I'd had my children, and (the radical mastectomy) seemed the 
best," she said. "Besides, I'm not Dolly Parton." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most emotional part of the event came when Mrs. Reagan, appearing 
near tears, talked about the death of her mother just days after her own 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though she didn't know me at the end, I still needed her a lot," Mrs. 
Reagan said. "I really had no time to recover from the operation or to grieve 
for my mother, whom I loved dearly." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan, who appeared without a fee, did not take questions from the media, 
but she did field friendly inquiries from those at the brunch. 
</P>
<P>
Circle 1000 chairman Sandy Sewell of Newport Beach said later: "At many times, 
she seems on the defensive in public and in the media, but I think today she 
let her guard down and showed her human side. . . . She seemed very warm and 
caring.ERIC LICHTBLAU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL TO EVALUATE CHILD-CARE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Redevelopment funds -- commonly used to help build shopping centers and 
subsidize low- and moderate-income housing -- might be spent to help launch an 
ambitious new child-care program in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the City Council, acting as the Agency for Community Development, 
voted unanimously to study a proposal by the Girls Club of Garden Grove for an 
expanded Kids Club program. 
</P>
<P>
The program eventually could put 50 or more inexpensive day-care centers on 
school sites throughout the city to provide supervision and recreation after 
school hours. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Halberstadt, Girls Club executive director, told the council that the 
$20,000 requested by her group would be "seed money" to organize a citywide 
program, based on a model facility soon to open at Stanford Elementary School, 
12721 Magnolia Ave. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, the Garden Grove Unified School District has agreed to lease 
property for $1 a year to accommodate two modular buildings for the program. 
Most of the $327,000 for the Stanford facility came from state grants, with 
$21,000 donated by the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We could put those on every school campus in Garden Grove," said Halberstadt. 
Each Kids Club facility would provide space for 50 to 75 boys and girls who are 
5 to 12 years old, she said. The redevelopment agency money would go to pay 
staff to develop grant proposals and other administrative tasks associated with 
expanding the program, she added. JAMES TORTOLANO

MARINE LIFE SERVED UP IN ROAD SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The arthropod, of the California spiny variety, was surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
Antennae waving, his layered tail twitching, the arthropod, more commonly known 
as a lobster, was eyeball to eyeball with about 10 second- and third-graders in 
Kendall Clark's class at Andrew Jackson Elementary School in Santa Ana. 
Everyone wanted to touch, but Carolyn Cosgrove-Wake warned them to be gentle. 
</P>
<P>
"Try not to touch his eyeball," Cosgrove-Wake said. "Would you want anybody 
touching your eyeball?" 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to the lobster's antennae. 
</P>
<P>
"They give him information," she said. "And his eyes, they look like a bug's 
because he is related to a bug." 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove-Wake, a marine biologist, is the driver and lecturer of the Orange 
County Marine Institute's traveling road show, Ocean in Motion. Out of a 
strategically loaded, new blue van, Cosgrove-Wake travels to schools all over 
the county offering a hands-on experience with live marine life. Joining the 
lobster on the traveling team is an octopus, a jar full of mussels, a sea star, 
oysters, clams and a sea urchin, among other creatures. The live lobster rides 
in a temperature controlled fiberglass aquarium custom made for the van by 
Cosgrove-Wake's husband, John Wake. 
</P>
<P>
The van also carries an assortment of shells, sand dollars, coral and other 
skeletal forms of marine life. The children listen for the sounds of the ocean 
and try to match the shells with a chart that identifies them. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to expose the children to a broader spectrum of their environment," 
Cosgrove-Wake said. "There's a living ocean out there they need to be aware of. 
We also try to instill a sense of conservation and preservation of the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
The alert, twitching California spiny lobster always wins lots of attention, 
Cosgrove-Wake said. The students learn that he doesn't have claws like his 
cousin from Maine, the family member sometimes offered in upscale restaurants; 
that his tail can propel him backwards to escape dangers; that like his other 
cousins, the bugs, he's a scavenger on the ocean floor, and that because his 
flaps on his tail don't overlap, he is a he and not a she. 
</P>
<P>
Real live creatures such as the lobster can spark a fascination that may 
overcome what is, for many children, a dreaded word -- science. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tell the children right away, 'This is science,' " Cosgrove-Wake 
said. "I'm trying to bring science back into the classroom. I tell them that we 
have to understand science and that it is our real world. If I can influence 
just one child that if we don't protect our environment we'll lose everything 
that we have, (the class) is successful." 
</P>
<P>
For some in Clark's class at Jackson School, this was their first experience 
with sea creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids have never been to the beach," said Gloria Roelen, 
principal of the 1,197-student school. The student enrollment is about 75% 
Latino, 17% Asian, and the remainder a mixture of ethnicities. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of their parents might work Saturdays and Sundays, possibly they don't 
have transportation or they might not feel comfortable venturing out," Roelen 
said. "Many of the parents don't speak English." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's class, made up of a combination second- and third-graders, is called 
"immersion English," in which the students are learning the English language as 
well as the customs of what, in many cases, is their new country. Part of that 
process is hands-on experiences such as the lessons taught by Ocean in Motion, 
Roelen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing -- look at them -- is that they're learning and 
having fun doing it," Roelen said. "They're involved in the learning process 
and it's not someone dictating to them." 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove-Wake travels from campus to campus, giving lectures at assemblies, 
talking to high school, junior high and grade school students. Wherever she 
goes, her family of creatures, especially the lobster, draws a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I feel like the Pied Piper," she said. LEN HALL)

NEW TRAIN SERVICE DELAYED FOR 4 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
New commuter train service between Orange County and Los Angeles won't begin 
until April 30, according to county transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, officials had said the new train would be available Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran into a problem with Santa Fe Railway, so we could not meet our target 
date," said Tom Fortune, spokesman for the Orange County Transportation 
Commission. There was a last-minute dispute involving Santa Fe's freight 
trains, which use the same tracks as the commuter train, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new commuter train will leave San Juan Capistrano for Los Angeles at 6:22 
a.m., with stops in Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fullerton, and will arrive in 
downtown Los Angeles at 7:25 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A southbound return train, at 5:30 p.m., will not start serving customers for 
another two months due to lack of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Both new trains will be operated by Amtrak under contract to the Orange County 
Transportation Commission, which will pay $1.8 million for the service. OCTC 
will offer 20% discounts off Amtrak's best rates for riders who buy monthly 
passes. Still, the fare from San Juan Capistrano to Los Angeles will be $7.02. 
A ticket to go from Santa Ana to Fullerton will cost $2.13. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the new train service is to relieve congestion on the Santa Ana 
Freeway during the current widening project, which will double the size of the 
freeway from the current six lanes to 12 lanes. JEFFREY PERLMAN

THIEVES HAD BIG HAUL OF STORED VALUABLES

<P>
The Orange Police Department on Wednesday announced five arrests in a theft 
ring in which hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property was stolen, 
mostly from self-storage facilities throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Police have recovered some of the property, including coins, stamps, U.S. 
currency dating back to the Civil War, vacuum cleaners, computers, VCRs, and 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The burglars picked the locks at the storage facilities and then replaced them, 
so many victims did not notice that items were missing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers of Orange's special enforcement detail began investigating the 
burglary ring last fall after they discovered stolen property at the residence 
of a suspect. Police say the ring could have been operating for as long as four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Tim Gabriel, 32, of Anaheim on seven counts of possession of 
stolen property and William McBride, 25, of Orange on charges of auto theft and 
violation of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Police have also arrested two people suspected of exchanging methamphetamines 
and cocaine for stolen property and an associate of one of the two. Officers 
declined to release the names of these three suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Orange police are continuing the investigation with 10 other police agencies 
and expect to recover more stolen property. To inquire about the stolen 
property, which is being stored at the Orange Police Department substation in 
Santiago Hills, call Sgt. Mike Pollok at (714) 532-0313. SHANNON SANDS

BILL TO REQUIRE CSU TRUSTEES TO HAVE DEGREES CLEARS PANEL 
</P>

A bill that would impose minimum educational requirements for appointees to the 
California State University Board of Trustees cleared its first hurdle 
Wednesday when the Senate Education Committee approved it by a vote of 6 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, sponsored by Sen. Daniel E. Boatwright (D-Concord), was inspired 
by revelations last year that Huntington Beach resident Marianthi Lansdale, now 
chairwoman of the CSU board, had claimed educational credentials she had not 
earned when first named to the board in 1985 by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale had claimed an associate of arts degree from Long Beach City College 
although she never was graduated from the two-year school. 
</P>
<P>
Boatwright has said the Lansdale controversy surprised him because it showed 
that there are no educational requirements for people appointed to the CSU 
board. Two other CSU trustees have never received a bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
His bill would require such a degree of future gubernatorial appointees to the 
prestigious post. 
</P>
<P>
"You have people controlling students who are applying for degrees, and I think 
. . . it certainly enhances that person if they have a baccalaureate degree. If 
they are administering a system, they can better understand the problems of the 
students," said Boatwright.

<TEXT>
<P>
After watching his boys' volleyball team upset top-ranked Huntington Beach 
Wednesday night, Edison Coach Brian Rofer wasn't about to rate the Chargers as 
Orange County's best. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do wind up ranked No. 1 you won't find me reading about it," Rofer said. 
"What does it mean? One day you're up and the next day you're a dog." 
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked Chargers were up Wednesday, cruising to a 16-14, 15-8, 12-15, 
15-9 victory in the Sunset League opener for both teams at Edison's gym. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (4-1 overall, 1-0 in league) avenged its loss to Huntington Beach 
earlier this month in the Dos Pueblos tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outside hitting and our blocking had a lot to do with our win," Rofer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli said Edison is the best team the Oilers 
have played this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat (second-ranked) Woodbridge and Edison beat us," Ciarelli said. "I 
think Edison is probably No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Van Reusen and Steve Snyder each had 17 kills for Edison. Snyder had four 
kills, including three aces, in an 8-0 run to open the second game and added 
six kills in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve got a little dehydrated in the fourth game and I had to call a timeout," 
Rofer said. "I told him he had to pull a little harder and he did." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lucas had 16 kills and Doug Cunningham had 11 for Huntington Beach, the 
defending league champion. The Oilers (4-1, 0-1) played without starting 
outside hitter Matt Taylor, who is out with a hernia injury until Easter. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get a particularly good match from Doug," Ciarelli said. "And when 
we're missing Matt, that means a lot. Edison keyed a lot of blocks on Doug and 
our other players didn't pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
Edison's supporting cast included Joe McCarthy (10 kills, two ace serves), 
Jason Curry (10 kills), Daryl Ayers (eight kills) and Aaron Boone (five kills). 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids before the game 'You're in the upper echelon now, with 
Huntington Beach and Mira Costa,' " Rofer said. "I told them that I can't coach 
that. They had to find it within themselves to play at that level." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, they did. 
</P>
<P>
In another Sunset League game: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 3, Fountain Valley 0 -- Chris Hocker had 15 kills and Greg Evans had 
12 kills to lead visiting Ocean View (6-3, 1-0) to a 15-10, 15-12, 15-12 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the Empire League: 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 3, Cypress 0 -- Jerome Facione had nine kills to lead host El Dorado 
(3-2, 1-0) to a 15-2, 15-5, 15-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 3, Santa Ana 0 -- Jason Galeener had 12 kills and Rocky Jones had 10 
for host Esperanza (9-0, 1-0) in a 15-12, 15-8, 15-5 sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 3, Los Alamitos 0 -- Jeff Janis had 10 kills as host Foothill (5-1, 
1-0) swept, 15-4, 15-7, 15-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the Garden Grove League: 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta 3, Santiago 0 -- Paul Price and Chris Doherty each had 11 kills as 
host La Quinta (6-1, 5-0) swept, 15-7, 15-6, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos 3, Garden Grove 0 -- Richard Pierce had 15 kills and six blocks 
to lead host Rancho Alamitos (5-6, 4-1) to a 16-14, 15-4, 15-7 victory. Garden 
Grove is 3-2 in league. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific Coast League: 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills 3, Costa Mesa 0 -- Greg Stone had 10 kills to lead Trabuco Hills 
(6-5, 2-3) to a 15-3, 15-9, 15-9 victory at Costa Mesa (0-5 in league). 
</P>
<P>
In nonleague:

BAD THROW HELPS MARINA BEAT MATER DEI

<P>
With two outs, two runners on, a scoreless game and Marina High School's top 
hitter, senior Christa Yorke, at the plate in the bottom of the seventh, Mater 
Dei Coach Cathy Quesnell apparently thought it best to walk the All-Sunset 
League catcher. Quesnell apparently thought it best to load the bases and put 
the pressure on the next batter -- a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
The only trouble was, Yorke came to bat again. Christa's younger sister, Robin, 
hit a blooper that hit the ground in front of shortstop Rose Imbriano, whose 
bad throw gave Marina (9-4) a 1-0 nonleague victory over previously undefeated 
and top-ranked Mater Dei Wednesday at Marina. Imbriano's throw for the force at 
third hit runner Becky Tackett in the back for an error and pinch-runner Kari 
Grandstaff scored. 
</P>
<P>
The game matched two of the county's top teams -- Marina is ranked sixth in the 
county softball coaches' poll -- in a rematch of last year's Southern Section 
5-A playoff opener. Marina won that game, too, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big, big win for us," Marina Coach Susie Calderon said. "Next week 
we start Sunset League and this should give us a boost." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei was without catcher Tracy Rice, who sprained her wrist in a collision 
at home plate this week. The Monarchs shifted their infield around to 
accommodate her absence. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei next competes in the Canyon Tournament of Champions 5-A final on 
Saturday, capping an exhausting month of play. "We're tired," Quesnell said. 
"By Saturday, we will have played 14 games in the month of March. 
</P>
<P>
"Marina is well-coached and they came out aggressive and Willa (Parchen) 
pitched a good game. It came down to who executed and who didn't. We had the 
bases loaded and runners on a couple of times, but we just didn't do it. We 
didn't get the timely hits." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei left three runners stranded in the second inning after Parchen walked 
two batters and a third reached base on an error. 
</P>
<P>
The Yorke connection thwarted another Monarch scoring opportunity in the third 
inning. Center fielder Robin threw a strike to her sister at the plate, 
preventing Mater Dei's Sundy Mosqueda from scoring from second on Amy Moeller's 
single. 
</P>
<P>
Parchen pitched a three-hitter, striking out 10 and walking two. Terri Kobata 
of Mater Dei pitched a two-hitter with seven strikeouts and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
In nonleague softball: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 2, Millikan 1 -- Lisa Quisto had two hits and scored the winning run 
in the bottom of the sixth on Marla Pickard's sacrifice fly to lead host Ocean 
View (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills 2, San Clemente 1 -- Brianna Burkman threw a one-hitter, striking 
out four to lead visiting Trabuco Hills (7-3). Linda Lunceford had two hits and 
scored for Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 6, Huntington Beach 3 -- Michelle Daugherty had a three-run 
triple to give Mission Viejo a 4-1 lead. Kristin Harrison followed with a solo 
home run for Mission Viejo (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 2, El Dorado 1 (9 innings) -- Isaura Campos singled in Benna Kennedy 
in the bottom of the ninth to lead host Fullerton (5-6). Cathleen Kennedy (4-4) 
struck out eight and gave up three hits for the victory.

OFFICE SPACE GLUT FORCES RENTS DOWN TO '85 RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So many of the county's big office buildings have high vacancy rates -- and so 
competitive has the local office market become in its search for tenants -- 
that landlords are charging about the same rents they were in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent market study that examined 116 markets nationwide, many 
cities -- and especially suburban areas such as Orange County -- continue to 
struggle with an oversupply of office space. 
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared by the New York market research firm Landauer 
Associates Inc. for the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, a Washington 
professional association. Members of the Orange County group released the study 
here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the group's other findings about Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
* Leasing activity was down "greatly" last year contrasted with 1988. 
Construction in North and Central Orange County virtually stopped. Construction 
continued strong around John Wayne Airport and the less-developed South County 
"even though the present level of demand did not warrant the growth." 
</P>
<P>
* Of the 48 million square feet of office space in the county's larger, newer 
buildings, 10 million was vacant last year, for a vacancy rate of 21.5%. 
</P>
<P>
* Landlords offered incentives that cut tenants' rents by up to 25%, including 
several months of free rents, picking up the tenants' old leases and office 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
* Some big insurance companies and others that built office buildings with 
local developers have put their interest in those buildings up for sale, so 
worried are they about the prospects for the office market. 
</P>
<P>
In the industrial market, nearly 13 million square feet of new space for 
research and development, warehouses and factories was leased. 
</P>
<P>
"Even so," the report says, "demand appeared to be down from its 1988 level. 
Part of the reason may be the high proportion of research and development 
activity (in Orange County), which is especially vulnerable to the looming 
downturn in defense." 
</P>
<P>
Dollars spent on leasing R&amp;D space, as it's called, dropped 15% last year. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, prices for land for industrial buildings continue to 
increase. That's the case even though these buildings must charge lower rents 
than offices; the land is still sold in what the report calls an "auction 
atmosphere." A shortage of land means fewer industrial buildings will be built 
on the speculation that tenants can be found for them. 
</P>
<P>
"The south part of the county, which is controlled by a few major landholders, 
will have the largest share of the activity," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
In the office market, the report predicts steeper declines in rents and 
increasing concessions by landlords. It is "paradoxical," the report says, that 
construction is still expected to increase 5% to 10%. Nine major projects are 
proposed for the airport area alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, the slow growth/no growth movements sweeping the state of 
California are pushing builders to get into the ground quickly before the rules 
of the game change," the section of the report on Orange County concludes. 
"Consequently, the probability of poorly planned projects exacerbating 
congestion and environmental problems is rising." 
</P>
<P>
INDUSTRIAL MARKET IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
Demand for industrial space, particularly in thg high-tech research and 
development sector, was substantially lower last year than in 1988, according 
to a survey commissioned by the Society of Office and Industrial Realtors.KEY 
MARKET SECTOR FACE OVERSUPPLY 
</P>
<P>
The supply of industrial properties smaller that 40,000 square feet moderately 
exceeded demand, while R&amp;D space was in substancial oversupply last 
year.1989 CONSTRUCTION

Acquisition Pact: Santa Monica-based Fremont General Corp. revealed this week 
that it agreed to pay Tomar Financial Corp. $4.9 million in cash, the 
assumption of $1.3 million in debt and future considerations for the 
acquisition of two thrift and loans in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price for Fresno-based Tomar, which owns Investors Thrift &amp; 
Loan and Liberty Thrift &amp; Loan, was listed in a filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. The operation was acquired a month ago by Fremont, one 
of the state's larger workers compensation insurers.

</P>
<P>
Mall officials said Wednesday that Liz Claiborne, a designer name most closely 
associated with upscale women's wear, will open a store under its own name in 
the mall this August. 
</P>
<P>
The store will carry perfumes, shoes, accessories, and women's and men's 
apparel. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the main store, Liz Claiborne will also operate a smaller outlet at the 
mall, called First Issue, featuring more casual women's wear. 
</P>
<P>
The landing of Liz Claiborne is in keeping with mall's recently announced plan 
to add more glitzy, Beverly Hills-type stores while weeding out smaller, less 
profitable operations. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its long-range plan, the mall is undergoing the most extensive 
remodeling in its 23-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The planned Liz Claiborne store is also a part of the trend among successful 
designer labels to open their own outlets even as department stores in the same 
shopping centers continue to offer their merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Under the most recent agreement, Liz Claiborne plans to open a 
11,552-square-foot store under its own name on the mall's second floor between 
Carrousel Court and the May Co. department store, said South Coast Plaza 
spokeswoman Maura Eggan. The First Issue store will occupy 4,531 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The main outlet will be the 10th in a chain that started last April with the 
opening of the first Liz Claiborne store in Novi, Mich., near Detroit, said 
Deirdre Deutsch, director of the training and market development for Liz 
Claiborne in New York.

POP BEAT: GUITARIST IN THE 'WRONG' PLACE AT RIGHT TIME ADDS A NEW TWIST TO 
FLAMENCO; 
</P>
<P>
OTTMAR LIEBERT CREDITS THE 'UN-MUSIC' TOWN OF SANTA FE FOR HIS NEW-FOUND 
SUCCESS WITH NOUVEAU FLAMENCO MUSIC.

<P>
Ottmar Liebert calls his music nouveau flamenco but it's really a potpourri of 
influences spanning Spain to Germany to China. Add a bit of luck and support 
from a notably un-music business town, and the result is one of the 
fastest-rising performers in contemporary instrumental music. 
</P>
<P>
The young acoustic guitarist, the offspring of a Chinese-German father and a 
Hungarian mother, performs at Hamptons in Santa Ana on Sunday night on a 
Southland swing that also includes three sold-out engagements at Westwood's Bon 
Appetit club. And it all has happened because Liebert made an unplanned stop in 
Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on my way to Los Angeles in early 1986," he said earlier this week, "and 
I had a friend who told me to stop in Santa Fe and rest a little bit. Seemed 
like a good idea, since I'd been putting in long hours in New York trying to 
make a pop music thing happen. But after I spent a few days in Santa Fe, I 
really didn't want to leave. So I went back to the East Coast, picked up my 
stuff and came back to stay." 
</P>
<P>
The laid-back environment of Santa Fe was a dramatic change for Liebert, who 
had been living in Boston, working hard at making a "pop song thing happen -- 
you know, sort of like Simple Minds or Duran Duran." A 12-inch single by the 
band he led with his brother Stefan had been released and his entire world of 
business contacts was on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it was different, all right," he said, laughing. "For one thing, I hadn't 
played acoustic guitar in quite a while, but that was the only kind of work I 
could get." 
</P>
<P>
"But when I started playing in restaurants for 20 bucks and a meal, I liked it. 
It was really direct, people responded to the music and it was right down to 
basics: food and money. Kind of the way it used to be, without lawyers, agents 
and managers." 
</P>
<P>
Liebert found himself surrounded by a group of people far different from the 
crowd he knew on the East Coast -- artists, jewelry designers, what he 
describes as "Santa Fe types." An artist, in fact, was the motivating force 
behind Liebert's album. 
</P>
<P>
"His name," said Liebert, "is Frank Howell, and he heard me at a private party. 
He came up to me, said he was impressed with my music, and told me to go ahead 
and make an album, at his expense. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Every year I like to put out something special for my friends.' His 
thought was to produce a CD that he could make a little booklet for. 
</P>
<P>
"But he had an early release date in mind to tie in with a party he was giving. 
I had three weeks to write 10 pieces, three weeks to record and mix them, and 
another few weeks to put them together for release. But we made the deadline. 
Frank did a bunch of original drawings, had the cover printed and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
That would have been it, had the CD been nothing more than a local release for 
the enjoyment of a few friends. But Howell's staff, impressed with the songs on 
the album, sent a few copies to radio stations, including Los Angeles' KTWV 
(94.7 FM), known as The Wave. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem," said Liebert, "was that whoever sent the CD to KTWV forgot to 
include any information. When they finally reached me they said, 'Who the hell 
are you? We just added five of your songs to our play list, and we don't know 
who you are!' 
</P>
<P>
"Frank was generous enough to allow me to sell the master to Higher Octave 
(record company). All he wanted was to sell 400 or 500 CDs to cover his costs. 
It was a very Santa Fe way to do business, and I'll be forever grateful to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
In the few weeks since its release, "Nouveau Flamenco" has performed 
impressively. Distributors report difficulty keeping copies of the CD in the 
stores, and it has moved rapidly up the adult contemporary record charts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its label, Liebert's music reflects his middle-European birth (in 
Cologne, West Germany) at least as much as it does his fascination with 
flamenco. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always loved the rhythmic aspects of flamenco," he said, "and I wanted to 
see how it would work with a kind of passionate, haunting Eastern European type 
of melody instead of something light and Spanish. But I had no idea it would 
work as well as it does." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, nouveau flamenco sounds like one of those natural combinations that 
somehow should have been thought of a long time ago. Liebert's acoustic guitar 
includes traces of Django Reinhardt, a touch or two of Paco De Lucia and a 
healthy seasoning of Hungarian Gypsy music. Toss in a foundation of passionate 
flamenco rhythms, and the result is a music that moves the body while it 
touches the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"If people had told me before this happened that all I had to do was just relax 
and let the music happen, I think I would have slapped them," Liebert said. 
"But that really is the way it's happened. 
</P>
<P>
"So maybe there really is some sort of magic here in Santa Fe. To come here, 
almost by accident, and have all this music and success happen to me is almost 
unbelievable -- especially after having tried so hard to make it with a totally 
different kind of music on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not complaining. I'm living in a place I love, doing music that moves 
me. So just do me a favor. Please don't tell anybody about the magic in Santa 
Fe. I want to keep things just the way they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Ottmar Liebert plays Sunday at 8 p.m. at Hamptons, 3503 S. Harbor 
Blvd., Santa Ana. Admission: $19.50. Information: (714) 979-5511.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO STEER YOUR RETURN THROUGH THE QUAGMIRE.

Preparing tax returns ranks right up there with starting a diet. 
</P>
<P>
With just 18 days left until the April 16 filing deadline, fewer than half the 
1.1 million Orange County taxpayers have mailed their state and federal income 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of us are fighting our way through night sweats and anxiety attacks as 
we guiltily eye that bulging cardboard box or brimming desk drawer into which 
we shoveled receipts, bills and check stubs for 12 months last year and into 
which we now must dive. 
</P>
<P>
But whether you file late or early, are wealthy or poor, there still are things 
to be learned -- perhaps even money to be saved. 
</P>
<P>
So read along as a six-pack of Orange County tax professionals take us on a 
tip-filled trip through the morass of our federal tax system, with the 
understanding that there are exceptions to every rule and that there is no 
substitute for getting advice tailored to your circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
After all, when even the pros complain that the tax laws have gotten incredibly 
complex, they aren't just trying to create more demand for their services. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to what Congress -- but few others -- called the Tax Reform Act of 1986, 
the federal income tax has become a quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that there wasn't any tax reform, says Norman A. Barker, a partner and 
director of tax matters at the Irvine office of Ernst &amp; Young, one of the 
so-called Big Six international public accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 act did relieve about 6 million low-income people of the burden of 
filing tax returns; many of the most abused deductions were done away with; the 
maximum tax was dropped to 33% from 50% and tax rates overall were lowered 
substantially, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But to do it, Congress created a Frankenstein's monster of a tax code. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took a poll of 1,000 tax preparation professionals, I doubt that you'd 
find five who would claim to know what all the tax laws are for 1989, and 
they'd be lying," said Douglas Ammerman, a partner and tax specialist at the 
Costa Mesa office of KPMG Peat Marwick, another of the Big Six firms. 
</P>
<P>
And if the big boys aren't sure these days of what's what, then what's the 
little guy who struggles year after year with a paperback tax help book and a 
shoe box full of receipts to do? 
</P>
<P>
Well, first of all, lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you've got partnerships piled upon tax shelters heaped on real estate 
investments -- in which case you're suicidal if you haven't already got a good 
tax accountant -- things probably aren't all that bleak. 
</P>
<P>
If you made it through your 1988 tax return and your circumstances haven't 
changed drastically, you should be able to get through the 1989 version with 
just a little more effort. 
</P>
<P>
One change this year is in the so-called kiddie tax, instituted to prevent 
parents from shunting income to their kids to take advantage of the children's 
generally lower tax rates. It treats all of a juvenile's interest and dividend 
earnings as if they are part of a scheme to defraud the government. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old law, interest earnings from assets given a child by grandparents 
or aunts and uncles or family friends were taxed as the child's income. 
</P>
<P>
Now, said Barker, the same money, even though the assets didn't come from 
parents trying to avoid taxes, is taxed at the parents' higher rate and can 
even bump the parents from the 28% bracket into the 33% bracket. 
</P>
<P>
And if a child is a young entrepreneur and goes out and earns lots of money and 
puts it in the bank, the investment income from the money earned by the child's 
own labor is subject to the same rules even though it had nothing to do with 
shifting income, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the changes in tax law since 1986 have been aimed at increasing revenue 
to the federal government by eliminating deductions, so investors -- especially 
real estate investors -- bear much of the burden. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Stinchfield, a partner in the Laguna Niguel tax and accounting firm of 
Stinchfield, Horvath &amp; Co., complains that Congress changed the rules in 
the middle of the game and didn't make allowances for the disruption to 
players. 
</P>
<P>
A South Orange County physician who is one of Stinchfield's clients had 
purchased a bank's headquarters building as an investment under pre-1986 tax 
rules that enabled him to deduct actual cash losses each year. 
</P>
<P>
"But under the new passive investment rules, he can't deduct his cash loss, so 
instead of a gain of $20,000, he's out $50,000 a year," Stinchfield said. 
</P>
<P>
In another situation, a man walked into the accountant's office with a year's 
worth of receipts, canceled checks and other records, ready to start 
preparation of his federal income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
The accountant gasped in horror while reviewing the client's investment 
transactions for the year. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the client had sold a rental unit for a hefty profit and then 
plowed the profit back into another, bigger piece of income-producing real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
He figured that the rules about capital gains were the same as for 
owner-occupied residences -- that he could defer the tax on the gain as long as 
he bought a new property for the same or more that he sold the old one for, and 
did it within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he figured wrong. The mistake cost him about $30,000 in capital 
gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But, you don't have to be a high-roller with money to pump into real estate 
speculation in order to make costly mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"People often don't really know what their filing status should be, and that 
can cost them," said Hal Kuchel, a tax planner and accountant in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
"A single person with a dependent child often will file as a single person 
instead of as head of household" with its substantially lower tax liability in 
higher income bracket, he said. A single person who provides more than half the 
income of an elderly parent -- even if that parent lives elsewhere -- also can 
qualify as a head of household. 
</P>
<P>
The savings start to become meaningful when taxable income tops $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
A single person with a dependent and taxable income of $25,000, for example, 
will pay $4,596 in federal income tax for 1989. The same tax return with the 
"head of household" filing status checked off, requires only $3,777 in taxes, a 
savings of nearly 22%. 
</P>
<P>
At the lower end of the income scale, taxpayers -- especially those who prepare 
their own returns -- often don't take advantage of possible earned income 
credit, said Bill and Yvonne Kirkendall, income tax preparers with offices in 
Garden Grove and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents with dependent children and adjusted gross family income below $19,340 
last year can get credit for their Social Security taxes up to $910," said 
Bill. 
</P>
<P>
"That means that they can actually get cash back even if they had no other tax 
liability," Yvonne added. "And $900 can make a lot of difference for many 
people, even in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The Kirkendalls said they also "find" money for a lot of clients who sell homes 
they earlier had refinanced. The points paid on a refinancing loan aren't 
deductible in the first year as they are with the initial mortgage loan, Bill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be amortized over the life of the loan. But a lot of people 
forget when they sell and pay off the refinanced loan that they have all those 
points stored up that they can deduct. We recently got an extra $4,000 
deduction for a client that way," said Yvonne. "He thought we were geniuses." 
</P>
<P>
The pages and pages of rules for deducting moving expenses also can hide 
deductions from the uninitiated, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are moving more than 35 miles and doing it to get closer to your job, 
and you have incurred expenses in selling your old home or buying a new one -- 
things like escrow fees, the cost of breaking a lease, realtors' commissions 
and such -- you can deduct up to $3,000 of those costs right away on the moving 
expenses form," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Hood and Diane Burch, partners in a small CPA firm in Los Alamitos, deal 
with a lot retirees and say clients at or nearing retirement age have special 
tax problems, generally minimizing taxes and avoiding penalties as they begin 
drawing from IRAs, Keoghs, 401(k)s and other tax-deferred retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
One major problem is with transferring a retirement fund to a new institution 
upon retirement, Hood said. "We see a lot of people who don't know that they 
have to roll over more than 50% of the money in the retirement fund -- put it 
into another IRA, for instance -- or they will be taxed on the whole thing as 
common income for the year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other tax tips from the professionals include: 
</P>
<P>
* Lump as many medical expenses as possible into a single year to boost the 
total high enough to gain a deduction. The law says only out-of-pocket expenses 
in excess of 7.5% of gross income are deductible, so for most taxpayers it 
takes a surgery and other hefty bills -- like orthodontics -- to gain a tax 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
* Pay off credit cards and other consumer debt as soon as possible. The 
deduction for consumer interest fell to 20% for 1989, will be only 10% this 
year and disappears in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* Divorces can have positive tax consequences if the warring parties can agree 
on a strategy. Court-ordered alimony, for example, is taxable to the recipient 
while child-support isn't. By changing a settlement to increase child support 
and reduce alimony, the total payment can be the same while the tax burden on 
the recipient is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, if you usually receive a tax refund, adjust your withholding so 
you take home a little more money each week. 
</P>
<P>
Unless it takes more than 45 days to send you your refund, the government 
doesn't pay interest on excess money it has collected from you all year long. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just giving your money away. 
</P>
<P>
...And Finally 
</P>
<P>
* The filing deadline this year is April 16, not April 15, which is a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* If you need federal tax forms and schedules, try your local public library or 
one of the two IRS walk-in assistance offices, at the federal building in the 
Santa Ana civic center or the Chet Holifield federal building in Laguna Niguel, 
at 24000 Avila Road. 
</P>
<P>
* The toll-free number for the IRS information service, if you can get through 
is 1-800-424-1014. 
</P>
<P>
* You can get an automatic three-month federal filing extention and a 
four-month state extension by mailing the appropriate extension request form by 
midnight, April 16. But if you woe taxes, be sure to include a check. The 
extension is for filing, not for paying. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-Saving Strategies 
</P>
<P>
* Self-employed and missed the Dec. 31 deadline for a Keogh plan? You have 
until April 16 to set aside up to $30,000 in a deductible Simplified Employee 
Pension plan -- or SEP. 
</P>
<P>
* If you pumped enough money into a 401(k) retirement plan to lower your 
adjusted gross income to $25,000 if single or $40,000 if married and filing 
jointly, you can set up an IRA for 1989 and shelter up to $2,000 more. Deadline 
is April 16. 
</P>
<P>
* People who worked two jobs in 1989 can claim a credit for excess Social 
Security tax if the total withheld by both employers exceeded $3,604.80. 
</P>
<P>
* Pay off credit card and other personal consumer debt if you haven't already. 
Interest on it is only 20% deductible for 1989 and deductibility disappears in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
* California residents who rented for at least six month of the year get a 
state tax credit, $137 for married couples and $60 for singles. 
</P>
<P>
Common Mistakes 
</P>
<P>
* Forgetting to sign return. 
</P>
<P>
* Forgetting to include Social Security numbers of taxpayers and/or dependents. 
</P>
<P>
* Math errors. 
</P>
<P>
* Excessive rounding-off. To avoid problems, round-off to the nearest dollar, 
not the nearest $10 or $100. 
</P>
<P>
* Failing to include all schedules and forms that back up deductions, income 
and investment earnings. 
</P>
<P>
* Not claiming proper filing status. A single parent can be a head of 
household. So can a single person who contributes the majority of an elderly 
parent's income. 
</P>
<P>
* Forgetting to deduct state income tax payments made in excess of withholding. 
</P>
<P>
How to Red-Flag Your Return 
</P>
<P>
* Take deductions for a home office if you are not self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
* Claim a self-employment business loss that wipes out your profit. 
</P>
<P>
* Deduct bad debt losses. 
</P>
<P>
* Close out an IRA or other qualified pension plan and don't report the income 
or the fact that it was rolled over into a new qualified plan. 
</P>
<P>
* Understate your income. IRS computer programs now match payments to you 
against the income you claim. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Out 
</P>
<P>
* Some 50,000 taxpayers, 2,000 of them in Orange County, were randomly selected 
for an intense audit of their 1988 returns. They are part of an ongoing program 
to develop data for taxpayer profiles. The odds that you will be audited are 
roughly one in 1,370. 
</P>
<P>
Odds on Being Audited 
</P>
<P>
* Gross income is $25K-$50K: 1 in 100. 
</P>
<P>
* Gross income exceeds $50K: 1 in 55. 
</P>
<P>
* If you file a partnership return: 1 in 139. 
</P>
<P>
* If you report business income of less than $25K: 1 in 76. 
</P>
<P>
* If you report business income of more than $100K: 1 in 26. 
</P>
<P>
Alterations for 1989 
</P>
<P>
* Social Security numbers must be reported for all claimed dependents age 2 and 
older. 
</P>
<P>
* Claims for child care credit must include taxpayer identification or Social 
Security number of any child care provider paid more than $500. Maximum age of 
eligible children dropped to 12 years, from 14. 
</P>
<P>
* Consumer interest deduction and deduction for net loss on passive activities 
each cut to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
* Parents can include interest and dividend income of children under 14 on 
their own tax returns instead of filing separate child return. 
</P>
<P>
* Students can only be deducted as dependents after age 23 if they earn less 
than $2,000 for the year. 
</P>
<P>
* If you are feeling harassed by the IRS, you can file Form 911 this year -- a 
complaint to the IRS ombudsman -- and enforcement action is suspended until 
your complaint is answered. 
</P>
<P>
New Rules For 1990 
</P>
<P>
* Consumer interest deduction and passive activity net loss deduction both drop 
to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
* Business mileage deduction for personal automobiles increases to 26 cents a 
mile. 
</P>
<P>
* Maximum before-tax employee contribution to a 401(k) retirement plan 
increases to $7,979. 
</P>
<P>
* The self-employed can deduct 50% of self-employment (Social Security) taxes 
in lieu of the old 2% credit. 
</P>
<P>
* Interest on savings bonds purchased in 1990 and after can be deductable if 
the bonds are used to pay for college tuition. 
</P>
<P>
* Cellular telephones placed in service or leased in 1990 must be used for 
business purposes at least 50% of the time to qualify for an accelerated 
business deduction. 
</P>
<P>
Don'ts for Donors 
</P>
<P>
* Don't forget to get receipts whenever possible, especially for non-cash 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't deduct the full payment for tickets to charity events such as banquets, 
balls and variety shows. Only the amount exceeding fair market value of the 
event is deductable. 
</P>
<P>
Retirement Rules 
</P>
<P>
* There is a 10% penalty on most distributions from qualified retirement plans 
before you reach age 59. 
</P>
<P>
* Social Security income becomes taxable if combined income -- earned, other 
retirement and investment income and 50% of Social Security income -- exceeds 
$25,000 if you are single or $32,000 if you are married and filing jointly.

FAMILY LIFE: CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH WILL HONOR ACTIVISTS AND GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
April is National Child Abuse Prevention Month, and while every month should be 
called that, it is a good time to pause and focus on this problem that won't go 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics continue to be horrifying. Last year, there were 22,667 cases of 
sexual, physical or emotional abuse reported to Orange County authorities, up 
from 18,844 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not counting the thousands of cases that go unreported, either 
because friends and neighbors are ignorant of them or prefer to look the other 
way. 
</P>
<P>
One thing we can be grateful for is the number of dedicated people and 
organizations working to remedy and eventually eradicate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
To honor them is one reason for National Child Abuse Prevention Month. Next 
Tuesday, the Child Abuse Council of Orange County will be doing just that at 
its annual recognition dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The affair will be at the Irvine Hilton and Towers with football great Merlin 
Olsen as master of ceremonies. The cost is $30 a person, and the fact that it's 
tax time should provide a gentle nudge to buy a couple of tickets because they 
are fully deductible, which means next year at this time, you will have a 
write-off. 
</P>
<P>
Among the individuals to be honored at the dinner is Rick Levy, a fifth-grader 
at Santiago Elementary School in Santa Ana, whose poster took first place in a 
contest sponsored by the Child Abuse Council. 
</P>
<P>
Others include: 
</P>
<P>
* Denise Sofka, prevention coordinator for the Developmental Disabilities 
Center in Orange, who will receive the state Department of Social Services 
Certificate of Recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
* Gene Howard, director of children's services for the Social Services Agency 
of Orange Council, who will be presented with the council's Special Services 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
* Deborah Stewart, M.D., of the UCI Medical Center Department of Pediatrics, 
who will be honored with the Child Advocate of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
* The Junior League of Orange County, for its Child Advocate Newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
* The Bergen Brunswig Corp. of Orange, which will receive the council's 
first-ever award to a business that has done the most to promote family-support 
systems for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the County Board of Supervisors will present the awards. 
Entertainment will be provided by the Allard Singers of the Maurice Allard 
Academy of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For tickets or more information, call Nancy Dickerson at (714) 634-3848. 
</P>
<P>
Other events scheduled for the month include a special night at Anaheim Stadium 
on April 10, a conference for professionals on April 5 and a forum for the 
public on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Stadium affair will honor Rick Levy and two poster contest 
runners-up -- Jill Hultgren and Felicia Dibernardo -- in ceremonies at home 
plate before the Angels-Seattle Mariners game. For ticket information, call 
Carole Neustadt at (714) 568-4322. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting for professionals is called the Families First Conference and is 
scheduled at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. Topics include ritual abuse, 
elder abuse, AIDS, drug babies and gang violence, among others. For 
information, call Sylvia Wall at (714) 937-2200. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast College is the host of the public forum, which will meet during 
the afternoon and evening. There is no charge. Call Cathie Alderson at (714) 
775-2300 or Barbara Oliver at (714) 897-2295 for further information. 
</P>
<P>
All month long, businesses, schools and libraries will be displaying the 
winning poster and distributing a newsletter called "Positive Parenting." Both 
are available on request by calling (714) 634-3848. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the best all-around information source for parents available today is 
the Orange County Children's Directory published each year by Riviera 
Publications of Capistrano Beach. The directory runs a little over 100 pages 
and offers a comprehensive listing of everything from health-care facilities to 
baby-sitting tips to educational facilities. Whether you're interested in dance 
classes or a place to turn to in crisis, you'll find a phone number and 
address. 
</P>
<P>
The directory is available for $4.95 from Riviera Publications at P.O. Box 
2894, Capistrano Beach, Calif. 92624. The phone number is (714) 496-2068.

British customs officers, who seized 40 nuclear bomb triggers believed bound 
for Baghdad, have also uncovered a plot to smuggle restricted naval equipment 
to Iraq, a government source said today. 
</P>
<P>
Press reports said an Iraqi who was ordered deported because of the suspected 
nuclear plot was also trying to get acoustic equipment used in underwater 
mines. 
</P>
<P>
"An investigation is taking place in northwest England and in Scotland 
connected with the illegal export of naval equipment to Iraq," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Press Assn. news agency said customs agents raided lawyers' and 
accountants' offices in Liverpool and Edinburgh on Wednesday night, seizing 
documents related to the investigation into the second alleged smuggling 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
British authorities seized the 40 U.S.-made triggers for nuclear weapons at 
London's Heathrow Airport on Wednesday after an 18-month investigation led by 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
An indictment unsealed in San Diego today names four Iraqis, a Frenchwoman and 
two British firms as defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq today denied British allegations of involvement in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd rejected any break in ties 
between the two nations.

A federal jury in Santa Ana today found Janet Faye McKinzie guilty of 
racketeering, conspiracy and fraud in connection with the 1987 failure of North 
America Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict came after a 2 1/2-month trial in U.S. District Court in which the 
defense argued that McKinzie was duped into carrying out the fraud because she 
was involuntarily intoxicated by drugs provided by the thrift's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie was a confidante of the thrift's former chairman, Dr. Duayne 
Christensen, a dentist who died mysteriously in a car accident hours before 
federal regulators took over the thrift. The institution's collapse cost 
taxpayers more than $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
The six-man, six-woman jury deliberated for nearly two weeks before finding 
McKinzie guilty on 22 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, wire fraud, bank 
fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property. McKinzie faces a 
possible sentence of up to 180 years in prison.

A suspect in the rape of an 11-year-old Irvine girl has been identified as a 
fired Beverly Hills police officer who may have used his police training to 
stalk his victim and gain entry into her home when she was alone, prosecutors 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Rush McCoy, 36, is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail in the Orange 
County Jail on six felony counts that include rape, sexual assault and 
burglary, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He will be arraigned April 6. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was at home alone when McCoy, posing as a deliveryman, persuaded her 
to open the door, police said. Investigators said the girl called 911 after the 
attack and later picked McCoy out of a photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
In executing a search warrant against McCoy and arresting him just hours after 
the Monday afternoon attack, police said they found physical evidence that 
connects the rape directly to McCoy, who worked for the Beverly Hills 
department for two years until he was fired in 1978 for unspecified reasons.

IMMIGRATION LAW CITED FOR EMPLOYERS' BIAS IN HIRING

<P>
A 4-year-old law designed to curb illegal immigration has led to hiring 
discrimination based on national origins, the General Accounting Office 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 10% of the 4.6 million employers considered under the GAO survey may 
be practicing job bias based on national origins because of confusion over the 
1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Discrimination related to the law "is serious but not pervasive," the 
congressional investigative agency said in its 162-page report. 
</P>
<P>
Employers discriminate "because the law's verification system does not provide 
a simple or reliable method to verify job applicants' eligibility to work," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Bias might be reduced, it said, if employers were given more information about 
the law's requirements and a simpler and more reliable system. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires employers to complete an eligibility form for each newly hired 
worker and allows the employees to establish their eligibility by presenting 
any one of 17 different documents, such as a U.S. passport or birth certificate 
or an alien registration card. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Labor Department may inspect 
the forms. Employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers are subject to 
civil and criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The provisions were part of an overall bill designed to reduce the number of 
illegal aliens flooding over the nation's southern border in search of jobs. 
Concerns were raised in Congress during debate on the bill that employers would 
discriminate against individuals who were "foreign-looking." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO found that the law "has apparently reduced illegal immigration and is 
not an unnecessary burden on employers." 
</P>
<P>
"GAO also found that there was widespread discrimination," the report said. 
"But was there discrimination as a result of (the law)? That is the key 
question Congress directed GAO to answer. GAO's answer is yes."

EX-BEVERLY HILLS POLICEMAN IS SUSPECT IN GIRL'S RAPE

A suspect in the rape of an 11-year-old Irvine girl has been identified as a

stalk his victim and gain entry to her home when she was alone, prosecutors 
said today.

<P>
The girl was home alone when McCoy, posing as a deliveryman, persuaded her to 
open the door, police said. Investigators said the girl called 911 after the 
attack and later picked McCoy out of a photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ariadne J. Symons, who prosecutes sex crimes, called the 
case particularly horrific. 
</P>
<P>
"This is far more frightening than your average rape," she said. "This man 
obviously stalked the child, chose her for whatever reason to be his victim, 
waited for her to be alone and planned the crime in what he thought would be 
the most undetectable way." 
</P>
<P>
In executing a search warrant against McCoy and arresting him just hours after 
the Monday afternoon attack, police said they found physical evidence 
connecting the rape to McCoy, who worked for the Beverly Hills department for 
two years until he was fired in 1978 for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found clothing belonging to McCoy and the victim, and well as 
a stained sheet believed to have been taken from the scene. Found at the crime 
scene were a knife that McCoy's roommate said belonged to the suspect and a 
package believed to have been used as a ruse by McCoy to convince his victim 
that he was a deliveryman, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also found at McCoy's residence a book entitled "How to Assert an 
Insanity Defense."

dispatched his brother to Lebanon in a new effort to win the release of Western 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Beirut newspaper Ad Diyar said Mahmoud Hashemi, Rafsanjani's 
brother, held meetings with leaders of Hezbollah, or Party of God, during a 
weeklong, unannounced visit that ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the envoy also met with Hussein Moussawi, who heads the 
Islamic Amal movement based in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. The movement forms 
the pro-Syrian wing of Hezbollah, Iran's main ally in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Ad-Diyar gave no further details, and a spokesman at the Iranian Embassy, who 
declined to be identified, said "we usually do not comment on such reports." 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for underground Shiite fanatics 
holding most of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon. Eight Americans are among 
those held.

Despite fears that the greenhouse effect is heating up Earth's atmosphere, 
temperature measurements taken by satellites show the planet has not warmed 
over the past decade, scientists reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the University of 
Alabama in Huntsville said they found dramatic swings in monthly and yearly 
temperature patterns, but the average global temperature did not rise -- or 
fall -- in the 10-year period from 1979 through 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no obvious long-term trend, and anomalies (variations) during the 
first five years nearly balance those during the last five years," researchers 
Roy Spencer and John Christy wrote in a study published in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists emphasized their findings go back only as far as 1979, and 
cannot be used to determine whether Earth has actually warmed about 1 degree 
Fahrenheit over the past century as most ground-based records show. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists have blamed the reported global warming over the past 100 years 
on the greenhouse effect, which is caused by higher emissions of carbon dioxide 
and other gases produced by fuel burning and clearing of forests. The gases act 
like a greenhouse by trapping energy in the atmosphere.

Police today freed a U.S. citizen who had been abducted hours earlier in the 
southern city of Cali and captured two men allegedly involved in the kidnaping, 
a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Robinson, hometown unknown, was freed unharmed in Cali, said a spokesman 
for the national police. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, reached by the Associated Press by telephone, refused to give 
his name. He said police captured two suspects, William Garcia and Luis Mazo, 
but had yet to establish why they wanted to kidnap Robinson.

The spokesman said he had no further information about the victim or the 
abduction, which occurred late Wednesday.

BUSH SAYS NATION IS ON 'WARTIME FOOTING' AGAINST AIDS, ASSAILS BIAS

President Bush, proclaiming the government "on a wartime footing" to find a 
cure for AIDS, today urged an end to discrimination against AIDS sufferers in 
the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a fight against a disease, not a fight against people. And we will 
not and we must not tolerate discrimination," he said in a speech to the 
National Leadership Coalition on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's comments reflected no new policy initiatives on the deadly disease, nor 
did he address the controversial issue of immigration restrictions on people 
infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he touted the $3.5 billion he is seeking this year to fund AIDS 
treatment, education and research at the National Institutes of Health in 
Bethesda, Md., and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on a wartime footing at NIH and CDC. Tonight, like every night, the 
lights will burn late in Bethesda and Atlanta, as a group of American pioneers 
work to solve this problem. If they do -- I should say, when they do -- it will 
be one of the greatest things our nation could do for the world." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was interrupted several times by AIDS activists. 
</P>
<P>
Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 
waved a sign reading, "Talk Is Cheap. AIDS Funding Is Not." Vaid, who was 
escorted out by security personnel, later said she thought Bush said some good 
things but should have addressed the immigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bush eventually paused and interrupted his speech to say he hoped that he could 
help the protesters understand that "not only you care, but we care, too, and 
I'm going to continue to do my very, very best." 
</P>
<P>
Five protesters were arrested before Bush arrived when they tried to gain 
admittance to the conference to hear the President's speech. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called for compassion, saying that he and his wife, Barbara, have lost 
friends to the disease, friends for whom their love "was just as great and just 
as intense as for anyone lost to heart disease or cancer or accidents." 
</P>
<P>
Bush called on Congress to pass legislation barring discrimination against 
those infected with the virus, and he urged business executives in his audience 
to keep HIV-infected people in the work force. 
</P>
<P>
"They can serve many more productive years with no threat to you, your other 
workers or your companies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The immigration issue has prompted several organizations to announce they will 
boycott an international conference on AIDS in San Francisco this summer. They 
want Bush to lift immigration restrictions on AIDS-infected people. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, however, has been trying to deflect the heat to Congress, 
saying the Administration has done all that its authority allows. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists had hoped that Bush would use his appearance today before the 
National Business Leadership Conference on AIDS -- his first major speech on 
AIDS -- to address the visa issue, but he did not mention it.

The Federal Reserve Board does not think creating a super regulator is the 
answer to disputes between the agencies that oversee the securities and futures 
markets, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a Senate panel today. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe some changes to the existing regulatory system are necessary to 
avoid the prospect that jurisdictional disputes among regulators will impede 
innovation in our financial markets, but consolidation of jurisdiction is not 
necessary to achieve this objective," Greenspan said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also said the division of authority between the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not 
increased the sharp price drops that have spooked small investors out of the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
"The board does not believe that the existing division of regulatory authority 
has increased volatility in the securities markets," the head of the nation's 
central bank told the securities subcommittee of the Senate Banking, Housing 
and Urban Affairs Committee.

WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS ITS NON-BANKER S&amp;L NOMINEE

The White House today rejected Democratic criticism of its selection of 
attorney T. Timothy Ryan Jr. to regulate the savings and loan industry, but 
acknowledged it "had a little trouble" finding a banker who would take the job. 
</P>
<P>
At a confirmation hearing, Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee gave a 
chilly reception to Ryan, questioning his ethics and lack of experience in 
banking or savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
In response, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, "Frankly we've 
had a little trouble finding people in the banking industry who want to take 
this job. 
</P>
<P>
"And also, frankly, I think it's not at all certain from the track record from 
the S&amp;L industry that that's the best place to draw on expertise." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the feeling here is, we need somebody who is a tough enforcer, who 
knows how to go in there and get things done and clean up this mess and knows 
how to use the law and use the resources at his command to crack some heads and 
get things moving," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 44, a former senior Labor Department official, now is a private attorney 
specializing in pension and employee benefit law. 
</P>
<P>
He told senators complaining about his lack of relevant experience that he was 
surprised when Treasury Department officials approached him about the job about 
four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ryan replied, "Absolutely," when senators asked if he was fully 
qualified to direct the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, 
which supervises 2,600 thrift institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not . . . an absolute expert on the thrift industry. I can tell you, 
though, that in the last four weeks, I've spent an enormous amount of time 
trying to educate myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he is an experienced manager of large organizations, citing his 
1981-83 tenure as solicitor of the Labor Department where he managed 600 
attorneys working in Washington and 16 field offices. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their misgivings, senators are under intense pressure to confirm Ryan 
quickly. President Bush nominated him March 22, hoping to blunt a 
constitutional challenge that has put the Administration's S&amp;L bailout 
program in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. district judge in Washington ruled last week that the acting director of 
the thrift office, Salvatore Martoche, and his predecessor, M. Danny Wall, 
lacked the constitutional authority to close failed thrifts because they were 
never confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The Banking Committee could vote on the nomination as soon as its next meeting 
on April 3.

Donald Trump received approval today from state gaming regulators to open the 
palatial $1-billion Taj Mahal Casino Resort, the developer's third casino in 
the famed resort city. 
</P>
<P>
The state Casino Control Commission voted unanimously to grant Trump a license. 
</P>
<P>
The New York developer also owns the Trump Plaza and the Trump Castle resorts. 
</P>
<P>
The property's grand opening next week will feature fireworks and a laser show. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have said that Trump will have to take in more than $1 
million daily to make the 1,250-room Taj a success. Trump floated $675 million 
in junk bonds to build the extravagant Boardwalk casino and must obtain $94 
million annually to service the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Roffman, a veteran securities analyst who tracks casino companies, was 
fired Friday from Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia after refusing 
to retract his opinion that the Taj might have difficulty during the 
traditionally slow winter months. Trump had complained to the firm about the 
analyst's views.

AMERICANS MADE MORE, SAVED MORE IN FEB. THAN IN JAN.

Americans made more money in February than in January and socked away a greater 
portion of it in savings, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Personal incomes climbed 0.9% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of $4.64 trillion -- the biggest monthly rise in nearly a year since a 1% gain 
in March last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the rate of increase in personal consumption spending last month slowed 
sharply to 0.4% for a total seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.63 trillion. 
That followed a 1.0% increase in spending in each of January and February. 
</P>
<P>
The higher earnings and more conservative spending pushed up the U.S. savings 
rate to 5.7% from 5.3% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Personal spending is the main engine of economic growth in the United States, 
accounting for about two-thirds of demand for total goods and services output, 
or GNP. 
</P>
<P>
The department reported Wednesday that GNP growth in the final three months was 
at a relatively weak annual rate of 1.1%, the poorest quarterly performance in 
more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
Personal savings went up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $225 billion 
in February from $206 billion in January. 
</P>
<P>
While economic policy-makers have deplored Americans' low savings rates in 
comparison with those of the rest of the world, the Bush Administration has 
simultaneously expressed concern that high interest rates might curb spending 
and slow expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department is reportedly urging the Federal Reserve Board -- the 
central bank that manipulates credit availability through its control of money 
supply policy -- not to keep interest rates so high that they will discourage 
borrowing and investment.

Lockheed Corp. Chairman Daniel Tellep, bowing to pressure from his big 
shareholders, promised today at the aerospace company's annual meeting to make 
major concessions to them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The concessions came at the behest of big pension funds and other institutional 
shareholders, many of whom defected to the side of Harold Simmons, the Texas 
investor who bought 19% of Lockheed and wants to oust the company's current 
board and replace them with his nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Results of voting at the meeting, taking place in a vast hangar, won't be known 
for at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
Tellep said that he met with 70 institutions during the proxy contest over the 
last two weeks and that he considered this his "baptism by fire and a highly 
valuable experience." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in shareholder democracy," he said, offering the following 
concessions to prove it: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If there is significant support, as expected, for a resolution that voting 
by shareholders be confidential, Lockheed will develop such a procedure to be 
used in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A provision to opt out of the strict anti-takeover provisions of law in 
Delaware, where Lockheed is incorporated. Tellep said even if that provision 
does not pass but there is a "significant" minority vote for it, he will 
recommend that the Lockheed board support an amendment at the next meeting to 
have Lockheed opt out of those provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A promise that after the meeting he will ask for a list of shareholder 
representatives to Lockheed's 15-member board and will select up to three 
directors from that list. He earlier offered to select only one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An offer to meet regularly with representatives of Simmons' NL Industries 
Inc. to discuss the future of Lockheed. "We hope the foregoing will provide 
recognition of our commitment to shareholder democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, the president of NL Industries, J. Landis Martin, said 
again he believes that Simmons could better focus Lockheed on its core 
businesses -- aeronautics, space and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Lockheed must return to its roots," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons says Lockheed, with a recent history of sagging earnings and 
underestimating costs of developing new programs, must insist on better profits 
at its non-core businesses or sell them off. 
</P>
<P>
The company portrays him as a corporate raider intent on personal profit, with 
no knowledge of how to run Lockheed, the nation's sixth-largest defense 
contractor with 1989 sales of $9.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, who has lost $100 million on his $530-million investment in Lockheed, 
insists that he can better focus the company on profiting from its core 
businesses and pull up the share price for all investors.

A rare lithographic print of Norwegian painter Edvard Munch's "Madonna" was 
stolen from an art gallery in central Oslo early today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Munch's "Madonna," one of the most famous lithographic works, and three 
lesser-known works of art were removed by the thieves, who used an iron rail to 
batter down the entrance to the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
According to one of the gallery owners, the theft of the "Madonna" was likely 
to have been what he called a "contract job" for a collector. Kjell Wenstad of 
the Kunsthuset gallery said the print, estimated to be worth about $245,000, 
was very rare and would be extremely difficult to sell.

CRITICS RAP NEWSWEEK ON RAP

<TEXT>
<P>
More than three dozen of the nation's music critics have sent a joint letter to 
Newsweek protesting the news magazine's recent "Rap Rage" cover story. In a 
letter to the editor, drafted by Greg Sandow of Entertainment Weekly, the 
critics lambaste the magazine for "lurid distortion" in a four-page essay, "The 
Rap Attitude," by Jerry Adler. 
</P>
<P>
The essay preceded a three-page cover story on "Decoding Rap Music." 
</P>
<P>
The critics say Adler's essay reduced the genre to one violent dimension, 
making rap "seem gigantically more violent, obscene and confrontational than it 
is. . . . Even artists who might be controversial were misrepresented." 
</P>
<P>
The letter also says that Adler barely mentions serious, constructive rap songs 
on the market, overlooks its women practitioners, and fails to place rap into 
any musical, social, cultural or historical context, choosing instead to invent 
"a nightmarish -- and racist -- fantasy about ignorant black men who scream 
obscene threats."

A major donor to an arts fund denied a report Wednesday that he threatened to 
withhold contributions if the fund does not sever ties to a museum exhibiting 
sexually explicit photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Post reported that George L. Ballou II had confirmed his 
participation in a campaign to get the Contemporary Arts Center to cancel the 
exhibition including the sexually graphic pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Ballou owns West Shell Inc., the city's largest real estate agency. 
</P>
<P>
The museum withdrew Sunday from the Fine Arts Fund's $5-million annual 
fund-raising drive, saying it wanted to protect other arts groups from a 
boycott by donors. 
</P>
<P>
Ballou said he opposes the exhibit as pornographic, but said he never 
threatened to withhold corporate or personal donations from the fund. He said 
he is the 17th-largest donor, but declined to give a specific figure. 
</P>
<P>
"For my personal donation, I think the exhibit is inappropriate and 
pornographic," Ballou said. "We have told our people, 'This is where we stand, 
and let your conscience be your guide.' I guess what I resent is the 
implication that we are applying pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Fine Arts Fund declined to comment. Lee A. Carter, chairman of 
the Institute of Fine Arts, which administers the fund, has said the group has 
received complaints but no explicit threats to withhold donations over the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 175 photographs in the exhibition depict homoerotic and 
sadomasochistic sex acts.

He doesn't wear a badge, but Mayor Sonny Bono figures he has enough moral 
authority to chase down speeding motorcyclists. 
</P>
<P>
Straddling his black Harley-Davidson last weekend, his honor spotted another 
motorcyclist rocket through an intersection on Palm Canyon Drive, the main 
thoroughfare in the desert resort 100 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I chased him down," Bono said Tuesday. "He said something about not being able 
to read my shirt, and I told him, 'You'd better learn to read real fast unless 
you want to spend the night in jail.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's when the young rider noticed "Mayor Sonny Bono" printed on Bono's 
T-shirt. The mayor, who became famous singing "I Got You Babe" with ex-wife 
Cher, got his man. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had hundreds of those bullet bikes come in in the last three years," 
the mayor said. "If they want to behave, fine. But most just go screaming 
through here."

Texas Rangers' star Nolan Ryan, baseball's all-time strikeout king, hinted at

Dallas Morning News reported today.

Dick Moss, Ryan's agent, met with Ranger general manager Tom Grieve on 
Wednesday to discuss a contract extension for Ryan, the newspaper said. Ryan's 
two-year contract expires after this season.

The 43-year-old Ryan "still feels pretty good," Moss said. "This is a nice

Former major league infielder and manager Johnny Neun, one of only nine players 
to execute an unassisted triple play, died Wednesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
Neun, who played with Ty Cobb as a Detroit Tiger, died of cancer of the 
pancreas at Union Memorial Hospital, officials said. The Baltimore native spent 
four years with the Detroit Tigers and ended his major league career with the 
Boston Braves in 1931 with a lifetime batting average of .289. 
</P>
<P>
He later managed for 12 years in the New York Yankees farm system, took over as 
Yankees manager temporarily in 1946 and managed the Cincinnati Reds in 1947 and 
1948. After managing the Reds, Neunn returned to the Yankees and spent 35 years 
with the organization, becoming a scout and player-development specialist for 
the team. He scouted for the Milwaukee Brewers until last year. 
</P>
<P>
Neun executed his game-ending triple play May 31, 1927, in Detroit when he was 
playing first base for the Tigers against the Cleveland Indians.

NORTH CAROLINA REJECTS VALVANO PLEA TO STAY ON

North Carolina State University rejected Jim Valvano's proposal that he stay as 
basketball coach with amendments to his contract, his attorney said today. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no indication that they found my proposal attractive in any 
fashion," attorney Woody Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said he plans to seek a hearing before the school's Board of Trustees but 
added, "We're having a hard time getting an audience with any decision maker." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said the university's lawyers did make a counterproposal to 
Valvano's request that he stay as coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a highly negative reaction thus far" to the school's counterproposal, 
Webb said. "He's not terribly pleased, because our proposal is that he wants to 
stay on." 
</P>
<P>
Webb did not provide details on the school's counterproposal, saying the school 
had asked that it not be disclosed. Howard Manning, a private attorney hired by 
the school, refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano left town, and Webb said he thinks he canceled plans to attend the 
Final Four tournament in Denver. A rally by supporters of the coach is planned 
Friday at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The North Carolina State Board of Trustees voted 9-3 to have Manning and Andy 
Vanore, chief deputy attorney general, find a way to terminate Valvano. The 
coach has been under scrutiny over NCAA violations by team members and 
allegations of point-shaving by former North Carolina players. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said he does not believe that vote is binding. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that vote was taken without hearing from either Coach Valvano or 
any representative of Coach Valvano and that it's fundamentally unfair to make 
that vote binding without having given him an opportunity to make his case," 
Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how university lawyers received the written proposal to give Valvano a 
new contract with more specific language regarding his duties, Webb said, "They 
don't appear very receptive to me." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State is under NCAA probation because some players sold 
complimentary tickets and basketball shoes. Valvano said he did not know about 
the practice and was not personally held responsible by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure for Valvano's removal increased when former player Charles Shackleford 
admitted accepting more than $60,000 in loans from two men -- one a prospective 
sports agent -- in violation of NCAA rules. Shackleford now plays for the New 
Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Later, ABC News quoted an unidentified former player as saying he and other 
former players, including Shackleford, had helped gamblers fix the outcome of 
at least four games. Investigators in North Carolina and New Jersey are 
pursuing the allegations, which have been denied by Shackleford. Valvano has 
not been implicated in the allegations.

CRITIC AT LARGE: MAN OF NOTE IN L.A. MUSICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Longevity seems to smile fondly on those in the arts. Despite the stresses and 
strains of creativity, and quite possibly because of the way the challenges 
keep the blood pumping, the men and women of the lively arts have a way of 
staying lively. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Roach, who teamed Laurel and Hardy and launched the "Our Gang" comedies, 
recently celebrated his 98th birthday and remains feisty as ever. Adolph Zukor, 
who founded Paramount, famously lived to be 102, nourished by a taste for 
goulash so spicy it made strong men weep. 
</P>
<P>
Young conductors are now the fashion but the Toscanini-Monteux tradition is 
that they don't really hit full stride until they pass 70. Luis Bunuel made 
several of his finest films in his 70s. Bertrand Russell was writing eloquent 
and often angry prose into his 90s. George Burns at 94 has made a new career 
out of old age. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense Edwin Lester, who will be 95 on Friday, has outlived his monument. 
The Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, which he founded in 1938 and from which he 
retired in 1977, has only a fraction of the 260,000 subscribers it had at its 
peak here and in San Francisco, and it no longer offers a San Francisco season 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in its day and at its best, the CLO was a kind of cultural bridge between 
the Los Angeles that was and the Los Angeles that emerged in the postwar era 
and is indeed still emerging. 
</P>
<P>
Lester, who is frail of step but sharp of mind and memory, said the other 
afternoon that "The mere fact of being 95 is utterly silly," adding that he had 
accomplished nothing of consequence in the last 10 years. At 95, that's an 
allowable vacation, of course, but Lester continues to dispatch a stream of 
letters to his friends in the press, keeping the record straight about the CLO 
and its contributions to the cultural growth of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Civic Light Opera, most notably, was a significant factor in the birth of 
the Music Center. "The important thing was our agreement to occupy the Pavilion 
for the six worst months of the year. That was what sold the county 
supervisors. The Stanford Research Institute had done an analysis for them and 
we were what was required." The CLO also contributed $250,000 to the Music 
Center. "It wasn't much compared to some of the other donations, but it 
helped," Lester says. When finances were tight in the early days, the CLO 
sometimes advanced the rent, Lester remembers. 
</P>
<P>
In his 39 years with the Civic Light Opera, Lester produced 90 shows himself, 
and there were another 50 or 60 he didn't produce. Critics often complained 
that as lavishly mounted and starry as the CLO productions were, they 
represented musical theater as it had been rather than as it was coming to be. 
</P>
<P>
But Lester argues that he knew his subscribers and there is evidence that he 
was right. When he booked "West Side Story," not without trepidation, 200 
subscribers canceled. When "Kiss Me Kate" was imported, Lester spotted some 
risque lyrics he thought would not sit well with his customers. The New York 
producer Saint Subber was aghast at the idea of asking Cole Porter to change 
the lyrics. "I called Porter directly and he couldn't have been nicer," Lester 
says. "He said he understood and would make some changes, and he did." 
</P>
<P>
Lester, born in New York, raised in Providence, R.I., and in Detroit, came to 
the founding of the CLO by a long road that began with piano lessons. "My 
problem has always been laziness," he says, unconvincingly. "I wouldn't 
practice enough, and someone said that I played the piano but I wasn't a 
pianist, and that was about right." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he got a job at $15 a week as intermission pianist at the Cafe 
Frontenac, a huge Detroit restaurant that had two orchestras. On his opening 
night, Lester made a grand entrance through the front door in a new-bought set 
of tails and white kid gloves and wearing a monocle ("which was useless"). He 
was 19. 
</P>
<P>
"Moebs, the manager, said, 'You're a showman!' " He made Lester the talent 
booker on the spot, quadrupled his salary and gave him a magnum of Champagne. 
Lester kept the job, playing the piano and booking singers, for four years.

When that palled, he tried his hand at vaudeville, working smalltime circuits 
as a singing pianist. He married ("a beautiful singer, naturally"), served 
briefly in World War I but did not get overseas. Afterward, he moved to Los 
Angeles because of his wife's failing health; she had tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles he talked his way into producing prologues for Sid Grauman's 
Million Dollar Theater. Then he became a wizard piano salesman, earning upwards 
from $10,000 in commissions when that was significant money. 
</P>
<P>
His success as salesman led Carl Laemmle to hire Lester as a sales manager at 
Universal Studios, but Lester didn't stay long. "Didn't like the movies," he 
says. In the early '30s, Lester began to manage singers; Nelson Eddy was 
briefly a client. To keep them busy, Lester started arranging events for them. 
</P>
<P>
He produced a Light Opera Festival, doing four shows for a week each. "I didn't 
know any better," says Lester. He persuaded 10 friends to guarantee $500 apiece 
against losses, but he managed to end the season with $2,500. Emboldened, he 
did another season and ended up $10,000 in the red. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lesson," he says: "Los Angeles demands stars. Just doing musicals 
wasn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
He raised fresh capital, persuaded John Charles Thomas to appear for the 
unprecedented sum of $7,500 a week, announced four shows for the price of three 
for subscribers, the four being the operettas "Blossom Time," "The Student 
Prince" and "The New Moon," and, as the added started, "Roberta" with its new 
star, Bob Hope, directly from a triumphant run in New York.

The Civic Light Opera was off and running. In 1957, Mary Martin did both "South 
Pacific" and "Annie Get Your Gun." In 1965 there was a 700,000-seat advance 
sale for a season that included Ricardo Montalban and Florence Henderson in 
"The King and I." 
</P>
<P>
There were some bombs along the way, including "1491," the Meredith Willson 
musical about Columbus getting ready to sail, and "Magdalena," a CLO original 
operetta based on the music of Villa-Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think it's the finest thing we ever did," Lester says, "and after all 
these years it's just come out on a new CD. But it may have been ahead of its 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The musical scene was changing. Rising costs have made it increasingly 
difficult to break even on the limited runs that were the CLO's custom. The 
Schubert, with unlimited runs, could outbid the CLO on the big hit musicals. 
The CLO patrons, with their conservative tastes, were declining in numbers. 
There simply weren't many new musicals coming along except the megaproductions 
and even the revivals are more expensive all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Like a good showman, Lester bowed out at right time, leaving himself and his 
audiences with some fine memories.
