MAN BITES TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Harry Shearer's "Road to Ruin" (Man Bites Town, Feb. 11): Now I 
remember the distinctive styles of the light fixtures on Wilshire and Olympic 
boulevards. Why didn't I notice then? 
</P>
<P>
The potholes might have been there on the streets for a long time, but when the 
powers-that-be finally started repairs, they tackled their work with a 
vengeance -- naturally, in the sweltering heat and smog. While the traffic 
crawled from three lanes into one, the acrid odor of the asphalt, dust and 
exhaust fumes spewed forth into the stagnant air. Work terminated on one 
stretch of road, only to commence a little farther on the same boulevard or 
adjacent street. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, I live therefore I drive, and I noticed when they did finally fix the 
street. I wonder, however, if the reverse is also true: I drive therefore I 
live.

SIZZLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed the article about Sizzler, and its depiction of Sizzler cuisine -- 
"Is it pre-Melrose, Melrose or post-Melrose?" I've been to many Sizzlers, and 
the hamburger seems to have disappeared off the menu. A better question might 
be is the hamburger post-Melrose, or am I merely post-Sizzler?

DECONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is something really offensive about The Times' printing an account of 
deconstruction by Jack Smith, who admits to being "ignorant," and even 
"frightened" by it (Feb. 11). If he doesn't understand deconstructionist 
theory, then why does he proceed to write about it? Just about everything he 
says is, indeed, meaningless (which is not, by the way, the same as ambiguous). 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, his proud display of ignorance is packaged in his usual annoying, 
self-congratulatory style. He calls deconstruction "an esoteric critical 
methodology that seems to undermine my temple and my reason for being." So, his 
reason for being is to understand everything readily, at face value, without 
ambivalence? And he's criticizing a scholarly movement? 
</P>
<P>
I admit that deconstructionist theory can be difficult to grasp, but an article 
that makes fun of it by a person who does not understand it does nothing to 
further anyone's knowledge and, in fact, belittles anyone who desires to really 
learn, unlike Smith, who is just looking for another excuse to show his ability 
to turn any topic into a cutesy Sunday magazine piece.

INVOKING ASIAN THINKING, USC'S BART KOSKO ARGUES THAT THE WORLD IS FAR MORE 
AMBIGUOUS THAN ARISTOTLE EVER IMAGINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON TEITELBAUM, Sheldon Teitelbaum writes for USC's Transcript, for USC 
Trojan Family and for Cinefantastique. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FROM THE UPSTAIRS PORCH window of his split-level house in the Puente Hills, 
Bart Kosko enjoys a view of the largest Buddhist temple in the Western 
Hemisphere. Others can keep their manicured lawns, swimming pools, hot tubs, 
nearby golf courses and sundry suburban amenities. For Kosko, a 30-year-old 
assistant professor of electrical engineering at USC, it is enough to be able 
to gaze at one of the few buildings in the country where his concept of reality 
would not be denounced as scientific heresy, as well as an affront to common 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a great belief in the truth of your own statements," says 
Kosko, whose mathematical ideas continue to encounter resistance and outrage 
from the scientific community in this country despite their widespread 
acceptance and application in Asia. "You may have stumbled, humbly, upon a 
universal truth, but if the world, everyone from Aristotle to Bertrand Russell, 
says you're wrong, it takes immense ego not to agree with them." 
</P>
<P>
The universal truth to which he refers is called fuzziness. Developed by Polish 
mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz during the 1920s and expanded (and named) 40 
years later by UC Berkeley computer scientist Lotfi A. Zadeh, fuzziness refutes 
the traditional Aristotelian theory of absolutes, arguing that the world is 
full of things that defy categorization by Western logic, things whose 
definitions are a little fuzzy. Its applications are, among other things, 
revolutionizing the computer world by creating systems of machine intelligence 
that compute in terms of humanlike reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko, a Zadeh protege, is the veritable St. Paul of Fuzziness. The American 
scientific community does not always take kindly to his devotions, however. 
Telling a modern scientist that there can be logic without Aristotelian tenets 
is like telling a Catholic there can be Christianity without Christ -- some 
scientists have apoplectic fits at the mention of Kosko's name. Yet in this 
time of technological competition with the East, Japanese and Chinese 
scientists embrace fuzziness; with its acceptance of universal ambiguity, 
fuzziness is the mathematical equivalent of Taoism and Zen Buddhism. In Japan, 
especially, Kosko is the Carl Sagan of fuzzy technology. Indeed, as many 
Western scientists begin rethinking Kosko, this mathematical doctrine may force 
the first actual confrontation, and eventually a melding, of Eastern and 
Western philosophical and scientific ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko is, in essence, the quintessential scientific cyberpunk -- a hip, 
street-smart prophet of life in the Information Age. He's also a musician, an 
essayist, a screenwriter -- and a pugnacious sort. He just may be able to pull 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
ZADEH EXPERIENCEDhis first flash of fuzzy revelation in a hotel bed; Kosko did 
his mentor one better -- he worked out key facets of the geometry of fuzziness 
while soaking in the hot tub behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
The hot tub is a fitting place for lambasting Aristotle. The baths were an 
ideal setting for ancient Greeks to debate the merits of the philosopher's 
world view. In his hot tub, Kosko contemplates his longstanding frustration 
with the way those theories continue to prejudice Western imagination. 
Aristotle, Kosko says, was just too rigid in his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Aristotle was never one to split hairs," he explains. "He believed you were 
either hairy or you weren't. If I were inclined to start plucking my own -- 
which I'm not -- I would eventually pull out the one hair that he would have 
argued separates hairy people from non-hairy people. Say that hair is number 
5,000. With it, I'm hairy. Without it, I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
In science, Kosko says, this absurd yet inviolable rule -- that everything must 
fit one category or another at all times -- is called the Law of the Excluded 
Middle. In it, there can be no shades of gray, no concepts such as "partly" or 
"mostly." 
</P>
<P>
"We've all been conditioned to behave as if this was true," Kosko says. "But it 
isn't -- not in the real world. These binary assumptions offer a handy first 
approximation of reality. But sooner or later they break down." 
</P>
<P>
Computers, symbols of pure logic, offer a good illustration of the difference 
between fuzzy and non-fuzzy thinking. Non-fuzzy computers, the technological 
epitome of Western thought, rely entirely on binary thinking. Everything they 
do is the result of combining ones and zeroes with and, or and not. The only 
thing programmed into the system is yes or no, categories of equality and 
inequality, and that's all that will come out. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional computer would have difficulties accommodating the concept of a 
platypus, for example, because it is an animal that is and is not, in equal 
measure, a mammal. Faced with this peculiar creature, the computer, like 
Western thought, is reduced to spinning its figurative gears. It simply cannot 
grapple with a world in which reality does not come prepackaged in crisp binary 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
Western scientists have tried to account for inherent ambiguities of the 
universe with probability theory -- the mathematical expression of the chance 
that a specific event will or will not occur. It usually takes the form of a 
number between one and zero. In the case of a set of tall people, for instance, 
individuals always would be categorized as tall or short. But a 5-foot-tall 
person might be described as having a 50% probability of belonging to the set, 
a 6-footer 90% and a 7-footer 100%. In other words, probability reflects the 
statistical averages of the population -- 50% are below 5 feet, 90% are shorter 
than 6 feet and 99% are shorter than 7. 
</P>
<P>
Probability works with large statistical populations, Kosko says, but is 
incapable of dealing with most individual situations. 
</P>
<P>
"It assumes the world is black or white," Kosko says, "but it's never sure 
which one. There's uncertainty in fuzziness, too, but it's deterministic 
uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
Fuzziness, he says, measures the degree to which an event occurs. In other 
words, it models reality, basically providing a shortcut that probability 
cannot. A computer programmed with fuzzy chips can deal with degrees. It may, 
for instance, be drizzling slightly outside. A fuzzy computer chip will not try 
to categorize it as raining or not because it relies on a user-defined alphabet 
of functions rather than the usual ones and zeros. It can compute variations of 
measurement from light to heavy, small to large or slow to fast. 
</P>
<P>
An ordinary air conditioner, for instance, kicks in when it senses the 
environment is either too hot or too cold. It either will begin blasting at 
full power or shut down. But this isn't efficient or conducive to maintaining 
maximum levels of comfort. A fuzzy air conditioner, however, would be able to 
identify the more-comfortable temperature ranges. Instead of shutting down, the 
fuzzy air conditioner would taper off its activities as the area being cooled 
became more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
So when a fuzzy computer is charged with control functions such as, say, 
docking a space shuttle with a space station, these translate into a smoothness 
of performance in control systems that cannot be replicated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of Kosko's theories revolve around computer applications, he has 
dozens of everyday examples to explain the difference between fuzziness and 
probability: Whether or not an article is published, to use one of his 
favorites, is a matter of probability. The degree to which it is published -- 
it may or may not have been heavily edited -- is one of fuzziness. Or suppose, 
he says, there is a 50% chance that there is an apple in your refrigerator. 
That is probability. But what if there is half an apple in the refrigerator? 
That half an apple has a 50% degree of membership in the set of whole apples. 
Numerically, these two situations are equivalent. Physically, however, they are 
distinct. 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO HIMSELF embodies the fuzzy idea of many things concealed in one. A former 
farm boy who escaped the Midwest on a full music scholarship to USC in 1978, 
Kosko straddles the disparate, and often antagonistic, cultures of science and 
art. As a neural networks expert and a fuzzy theorist, he has organized several 
important international conferences and is about to publish the first college 
textbook about neural networks -- computer systems that emulate an organism's 
ability to learn by experience. NASA uses him as a consultant on the space 
shuttle, as did the Strategic Defense Initiative Office. Outside the realm of 
science, Kosko is an accomplished composer who scores his own videotaped 
lectures and a published writer and essayist. Currently, he is collaborating 
with Bill Gray, co-writer of "The Philadelphia Experiment," on a 
science-fiction screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that many people within academia frown upon my outside pursuits," 
Kosko says. "I suppose they view it as a dissipation of energy. I see it as a 
stimulant. I have a lot of energy." 
</P>
<P>
Kosko is a "bewildering combination of talents," says Marvin Minsky, an 
artificial intelligence pioneer at MIT. George Klir, editor of the prestigious 
International Journal of General Systems (soon to publish Kosko's latest paper, 
which details the theorems proving fuzziness) calls Kosko's mathematical ideas 
"quite profound." And Zadeh, his mentor, calls him "one of the most unusual and 
most highly gifted individuals I have ever met." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath it all lies obduracy that prevents Kosko from ever backing down from a 
fight. Bart Kosko is cocky and tenacious and driven by the belief that time is 
the enemy of all things. And to keep up with the exponential rate of change 
engulfing the world, he is prepared to do without sleep -- Kosko puts in a mere 
four hours of sack time nightly. Uncharacteristically for one so young, Kosko 
feels the clock ticking deep in his gut. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko grew up in a largely Slavic, working-class Kansas City neighborhood 
called Strawberry Hill. His childhood was an odd mixture of "Little House on 
the Prairie" and the "Lord of the Flies." The woods behind his house were great 
for woodcraft, hunting and trapping and amateur rocketry. But they were also 
the scenes of sometimes vicious B B gun, wrist-rocket and Molotov cocktail 
battles between warring neighborhood kids. Bart, his friends recall, could 
always be found in the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart was the most passionate person I ever met," recalls childhood friend 
Kevin Helliker, an author and journalist who lived two houses down from him as 
a boy. "Our sense of the Koskos was that they had more fun than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
That changed tragically in Bart's 10th year, when their house burned down 
because of an electrical short. A few months later, Bart's father, a building 
contractor, was killed in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
"All kids have a keen sense of what's fair and not," Helliker says. "But Bart 
had this tremendous, inborn outrage at injustice. That outrage only increased 
after the death of his father." 
</P>
<P>
The financially strapped Koskos moved to a farm near Lansing, Kan., where Bart 
threw himself into a variety of pastimes to escape his loneliness and anger. He 
gobbled up books on science, philosophy, literature, art and politics. Along 
with improving his karate, he taught himself how to play the mandolin, guitar, 
balalaika and piano. His friends never knew of his musical acumen until they 
read in the newspapers that he had won a national Young Composers Contest. Then 
in 1977, he won a full scholarship to USC, having composed an orchestral 
overture to "The Count of Monte Cristo" in high school. 
</P>
<P>
As an undergraduate at USC, Kosko decided to supplement his income by writing 
for pay. Learning that the men's adventure market was wide open, he placed 
short pieces in magazines such as Oui and Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
What motivates Kosko? "You have to understand that Bart is indignant over the 
ultimate imminence of his own death," says Helliker in an attempt to analyze 
his friend's drive to succeed in so many areas. "Last year, when we spent some 
time together, he advised me almost daily to reflect on the fact that the 
coroner would be cutting out my guts sooner than I imagine. Death was never far 
off -- it should be stared in the face on a daily basis, he said, to remind us 
we don't have time to waste." 
</P>
<P>
Kosko agrees that he views "with dread" the prospect of his own demise. 
Mortality is, in fact, what makes Bart run as if someone -- or something -- 
were chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO'S STAY at the USC School of Music was short-lived. Although he had passed 
his graduate placement exams, he and the school differed over what he should be 
studying. "I just hated atonal music," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko kept his scholarship for a year, but he was strongly urged to find 
another major. He chose philosophy and economics, eventually becoming a fan of 
free market economist Milton Friedman and a campus libertarian activist. But he 
soon ran into conceptual difficulties that might not have fazed his fellow 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"In philosophy," he explains, "one does logic. But the Aristotelian theories 
underlying it hadn't changed in 3,000 years. That is never symptomatic of a 
healthy theory. 
</P>
<P>
"I eventually abandoned philosophy because I felt that there was no room in 
academia for philosophers in the classical sense that Kant, Aristotle, Hume and 
Descartes had been. They had done their best to master all the science and 
mathematics of their day. In many cases they actually contributed to it. I 
began checking out math books." Kosko went on, in fact, to secure a master's 
degree in mathematics and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which he viewed as 
a field in which most of his scientific interests converged. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko's fuzzy road to Damascus ran through Austin, Tex., where he met Zadeh at 
an artificial intelligence conference in 1984. A year before that, he first saw 
the word fuzzy in a scientific paper. Kosko recalls being struck by revelatory 
wonder. "This really seemed to tie together many of my concerns," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Zadeh was fiercely attacked for his ideas. Kosko, a young 
graduate student, without a doctorate much less professional standing, stood in 
front of a room filled with the Pharisees of the scientific community and 
mounted an impassioned defense of a concept of fuzziness, although the 
mathematical questions had not been asked or answered. (Two years later at 
another conference, this same fervor would induce one scientist to bang on a 
table in Kruschevian fury, yelling that "a set is a set is a set.") Zadeh was 
impressed. Immediately afterward, Kosko mailed Zadeh a theorem supporting 
fuzziness. Zadeh eventually became Kosko's thesis adviser. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Kosko attended another conference at which a well-known 
probabilist insisted publicly, and almost persuasively, that Zadeh was 
violating some inherent law of nature with his theories. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a chill going through the audience," recounts Kosko. "I suddenly 
had the sinking feeling that maybe there really is no fool like an old fool. At 
that point, I decided I had to know definitively if fuzziness was true. I was 
like a theist impelled to establish the existence of God. If it were so, I'd 
become a priest. If not, I'd be the biggest atheist that ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
After conscientious deliberation and much back-to-the-basics mathematical 
formulation, Kosko eventually decided in favor of fuzziness. His dedication 
marked him as both maverick and dangerous iconoclast. Notoriety came during the 
mid-'80s, when he began to vigorously champion neural networks. Now an accepted 
part of the computer world, they were as scientifically outre then as fuzziness 
is now. 
</P>
<P>
IN ADDITION TO being its prophet, Kosko has made a unique contribution to fuzzy 
set theory. He geometrized fuzziness, gave it concrete form and functionality, 
just as Einstein geometrized space and time. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko pictures the set of fuzzy sets as a Rubik's cube. Each set becomes a 
point in the cube. Conventional sets occupy the corners of the cube with fuzzy 
sets occupying the rest of the cube. Each element in the fuzzy sets belongs to 
the set to a different degree. The farther the set is from the corner, the more 
it resembles its own opposite. At the midpoint, the set equals its own 
opposite. That's where the world's classical paradoxes reside, Kosko says. The 
points within the cube model ambiguity. Once within the cube, he says, we can 
accept and understand the paradoxes and ambiguities of life. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko calls this "the black hole of set theory, where a thing can be its own 
opposite." Here, for instance, you will find the proverbial cup that is half 
empty and half full, the Taoist concept of yin yang, the liar from Crete who 
said all Cretans are liars, Bertrand Russell's set of all sets that are not 
members of themselves, and Russell's barber. 
</P>
<P>
Russell's barber, Kosko explains, is a bewhiskered man who lives in a town and 
who shaves a man if and only if he does not shave himself. So who, one might 
ask, shaves the barber? If he shaves himself, by definition he does not. But if 
he doesn't, he does. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of speculation is enough to drive most Westerners crazy, and 
according to the annals of mathematical history, many have despaired over 
resolving such enigmas. But, Kosko says, despair only sets in if one rigidly 
ascribes to an arbitrary insistence on bivalence. People in the Far East, he 
says, would not likely fall into such a trap. In societies where Buddhism is 
common, such as Japan -- which he visits frequently as consultant, conference 
organizer and general representative of what many Japanese corporations 
consider the future of technology -- the idea of a thing containing its own 
opposite is not hard to accept. It may, in fact, be a characteristic of mature 
civilizations that they are simply more capable of recognizing fundamental 
limits in man's ability to know the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end," he says, "the insistence on either / or interpretations of 
reality, which Western science relies upon, is merely a cultural preference." 
</P>
<P>
Fuzzy proponents believe that fuzzy thinking may hold the key to the 
development of the kind of artificial intelligence suggested by HAL, the 
computer in Stanley Kubrick's film, "2001: A Space Odyssey." Katsushige Mita, 
president of Hitachi Ltd. and chairman of the board of LIFE, Japan's new 
Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering Research (which is funded by the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry and more than 45 of Japan's 
largest high-tech corporations), believes that "fuzzy artificial intelligence 
will play an important role in the future intimate relationship between men and 
computers." 
</P>
<P>
Already, manufacturers in Japan are spinning off a host of applications, from 
air conditioners, camcorders and automobile transmissions to subway trains and 
stock-trading programs. All use fuzzy chips that enables control systems to 
smooth out functions that otherwise might oscillate between minimum and maximum 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Many American scientists insist that probability can do anything fuzziness can, 
and generally with better results. Only one U.S. company, Togai Infralogic of 
Irvine, designs and produces fuzzy chips. Some critics argue that the concept 
of fuzziness has never been articulated in a manner scientists could validate. 
Judea Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA, says he is "still waiting 
for a good definition of what a fuzzy system actually is. I haven't yet seen 
one that is divorced from jargon." 
</P>
<P>
"Any problem which fuzzy technique is designed to handle can be solved just as 
well, if not better, within a probabilistic framework," adds Peter C. 
Cheeseman, a researcher at the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science 
now on contract with NASA Ames Research Center near San Francisco. Scientists 
there are exploring fuzzy control techniques for space-shuttle docking 
maneuvers. Cheeseman is not impressed by these efforts. According to Cheeseman 
and other digital purists, Kosko and other fuzzy advocates have vastly oversold 
the benefits of their reasoning. Fuzziness, by its very nature, may lead to 
unreliable systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be on a spacecraft being docked by fuzzy techniques," he 
says. "It may work well 99% of the time until, whoops, hey, no space station!" 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO'S CRITICS must wonder how long he can remain so brash. Burnouts are no 
rarity in science, and Kosko, who for five years has been passionately 
campaigning for fuzziness, seems to be pushing his luck. Those who know him 
well, however, have few such qualms. 
</P>
<P>
"In Einstein's day," recalls Robert Hecht-Nielsen, a former colleague of 
Kosko's who is now owner and president of a high-tech firm in San Diego, "there 
were a number of great intellects who did amazing things. But they never 
achieved Einstein's prominence, despite their talent, because they had no 
staying power. I'm not comparing Bart to Einstein in any definitive sense, but 
I do think he can hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
So, Kosko believes, can fuzziness. He says that it will ultimately make 
possible genuine reasoning systems in machine intelligence, where artificial 
intelligence and neural network approaches have failed. Working a fundamental 
change in the way people regard the world, however, will take decades, if not 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Westerners have not yet faced, in any deep sense, the inherent 
screwiness of the physical universe as demonstrated by physicists during the 
early decades of this century. Eventually, Kosko says, "our physical 
explorations of subatomic reality, antimatter, and the space-time fabric will 
probably lead us to entirely different times and places, different definitions 
of reality." 
</P>
<P>
"There may be no God but the Mathmaker," Kosko has written. "And Science is his 
prophet." Kosko's own prophecies, he prefers to make known in his upcoming 
science-fiction movie. The one thing we can count on, he says, is that 
fuzziness is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The question, however, is to what degree.

MEN'S SPRING FASHIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This spring, look for a softer silhouette in menswear. Shoulders are slightly 
rounded and gently shaped, creating a more natural form than the rigid lines of 
recent seasons, and the look continues with the generally looser fit of 
ventless jackets and pleated pants. Fabrics such as linen, lightweight wool, 
silk and rayon hold their shape, but they also drape gracefully. Two- and 
four-button, double-breasted suits with peaked or notched lapels are prominent 
designs, but they are softer and less serious than in previous collections, 
especially when worn with a colorful shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Most trousers are uncuffed, usually with multiple soft pleats, and some 
designers have dispensed with the center crease (but try telling that to the 
dry cleaners). For fashion-conscious men today, color defines an individual's 
style. Over the past few seasons, even conservative businessmen have been 
inching their way into red, yellow and pink ties against gray suits and navy 
blazers. Boldly printed 3- to 4-inch-wide ties with designs lifted from the 
'30s and '40s can make a personal statement against the most conservative suit 
and shirt. If a wide tie is unacceptable, bright, solid-color, 2-inch-wide knit 
ties will narrow the focus. Brightly colored socks, belts or shirts also can be 
juxtaposed with neutral colors. And for the few who are completely fearless, 
bold color -- eggplant purple, tomato red, marigold yellow -- can be worn 
full-force in jackets and trousers. 
</P>
<P>
Because Southern California is a hub of creative professions from entertainment 
to art, fashion, food and architecture, men here seem to feel easier about 
wearing color than do their counterparts in Midwestern or East Coast areas. The 
accepted theory is that the more creative a man's profession, the more color he 
can wear.

While "House Party" took off surprisingly well, a number of recent releases 
with bigger budgets, stars and profiles haven't. Among the more disappointing: 
"Revenge," $15.3 million, 38 days; "Stella," $19.4 million, 52 days; "Men Don't 
Leave," $6 million, 52 days; "Blue Steel," $5.6 million, 10 days. And despite 
all the Rob Lowe publicity, the opening of "Bad Influence" hasn't been a 
thriller -- a modest $10 million on 1,300 screens in its first 17 days. John M.

Despite a slew of celebs, who helped net a hefty $85,000 for the evening, the 
AIDS Hospice Foundation's Oscar night fund-raiser at the Directors Guild of 
America got scant press coverage last week. One trade paper columnist 
mistakenly referred to it as "the DGA party." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the evening attributed the lack of media attention to a soft 
publicity push: "Since it was our first one, we didn't want to oversell." 
</P>
<P>
The Schutrum-Piteo Foundation, a nonprofit group that provides care to single 
seniors, underwrote the event, which was produced by the Friends of the AIDS 
Hospice. Maple Drive, 72 Market St. and a dozen other posh restaurants provided 
food and waiters. Studios pitched in personnel. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
In a unique fund-raising twist, the foundation arranged for sponsors to put up 
$1,000 for every celebrity who signed a guest book before the crowd. Among the 
stars showing up: Angelica Huston, ex-Gov. Jerry Brown, Edward James Olmos, 
Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, Dudley Moore, Sally Kirkland, Robert Downey 
Jr., Estelle Getty, Rob Lowe. Bob Goen, host of the daytime "Wheel of Fortune," 
emceed. 
</P>

Biggest moment of the evening: when "Common Threads: Stories From the (AIDS) 
Quilt" won the Oscar for best documentary. John M. Wilson

Judd Nelson stars as Marty Malt, a man with something extra -- an arm growing 
out of his back -- when the dark comedy "The Dark Backward" shoots later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The arm is going to be realistic -- almost like another character, like the 
tail on the lion in 'The Wizard of Oz,' " promises co-producer Randy Turrow, 
adding that special effects are already underway. 
</P>
<P>
To be directed by scripter Adam Rifkin, the "around $2 million" picture 
explores what happens when Marty -- a garbage man -- realizes his dream to be a 
comedian. That weird third arm is his ticket to success, but when it suddenly 
disappears. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Turrow promises "some surprising cameos" -- possibly some of Nelson's buddies, 
with whom Rifkin teamed in his "Never on Tuesday." Not yet released in this 
country, it co-stars Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Nicolas Cage and Cary 
Elwes. Pat H. Broeske

Aidan Quinn and John Lithgow will play missionaries in the Amazon in the 
ecological drama, "At Play In the Fields of the Lord," joining previously 
announced Laura Dern and Kathy Bates. The Saul Zaentz production, directed by 
Hector Babenco, is scheduled to get underway in Brazil mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Kristofferson plays a police detective who befriends Drew Barrymore, a 
teen-ager being stalked by her sister's killer, in writer-director Richard 
Danus' "Tipperary." The film, produced by Alan Amiel, begins photography May 14 
in a still undetermined urban location. Cannon Pictures distributes. 
</P>
<P>
Eriq LaSalle, the young black actor who played Eddie Murphy's rival for the 
hand of Shari Headley in "Coming to America," will replace Denzel Washington in 
Sanford/Pillsbury's "Love Field." Washington dropped out last week, expressing 
dissatisfaction with the development of his character. The film, written by Don 
Roos and starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Brian Kerwin and 6-year-old Stephanie 
McFadden (who plays LaSalle's daughter), begins filming in North Carolina 
Monday under Jonathan Kaplan's direction. Orion will distribute. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Propaganda Films is about to launch its own "Love Field." Both 
titles refer to the Dallas airfield where President John Kennedy landed that 
fatal day, Nov. 22, 1963. While the Sanford/Pillsbury production concerns the 
relationships a woman forms on a bus trip in the days following the 
assassination, Propaganda's film focuses on Jack Ruby and his relationship with 
Candy Barr, a stripper in his Dallas nightclub. English playwright Stephen 
Davis is currently polishing his script for director David Fincher, a director 
of music videos who will make his feature debut. Yoni Sighvatsson and Steven 
Golin will produce. No production date is set. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Ford, who received the French Legion of Honor eight months ago, returns 
to France to star opposite Alain Delon in the English-language political 
thriller, "Black Sky." He plays the American ambassador to France in this 
Italian-French co-production. Director Flavio Mogherini rolls cameras for 
producer Gianni Massaro in Paris April 23. 
</P>
<P>
River Phoenix will star in Warners' "Dog Fight," a tale of young Vietnam-era 
enlistees whose wager over who will bring the ugliest girl to their favorite 
bar on a Saturday night leads to unexpected consequences. Once on George Roy 
Hill's calendar, the film will now be directed by Nancy Savoca, director of 
last year's cult hit, "True Love." The film, written by Bob Comfort, begins 
filming early May in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Ticotin, Joanna Gleason, Philip Bosco and Kevin O'Connor join Bryan 
Brown and Brian Dennehy in Orion's "F/X 2." Production gets under way in 
Toronto the end of April under the direction of Richard Franklin. Dodi Fayad

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: BALLET OF LOS ANGELES FINALLY PLAYS L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he promised in October, John Clifford will bring his Ballet of Los Angeles 
to Los Angeles, for the first time, next Sunday. The 3-year-old touring company 
has been traveling with some regularity across the United States since its 
founding in 1987 -- but has never danced in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, longtime dance observers will note that a Clifford company has not 
danced in Los Angeles since the final local performances of the now-defunct Los 
Angeles Ballet (1975-85) in the summer of 1984; the company gave its finale 
ultimo in San Jose that fall, then formally disbanded the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford said last fall that he hasn't been avoiding Los Angeles, and would 
have been here sooner if "there were no deficits involved." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Ballet of Los Angeles is presenting itself as part of the company's 
spring tour. Two performances will be given in Bing Theater next Sunday at 3 
and 8 p.m. The 11-member touring group will give one program twice: 
Balanchine's "Apollo," Clifford's "Songs of a Wayfarer," and his new "Rio Bar 
and Grill," to music of Milhaud. 
</P>
<P>
The tour dancers: Allegra Kent, Nancy Davis, Leslie Carothers, Antonio Lopez, 
Courtland Weaver, David MacGillivray. Mandy Bawden, Diane Dickson, Diane 
Diefenderfer, Sean Carey, and Stuart Loungway. In addition, two New York City 
Ballet principals, both of them alumni of the old Los Angeles Ballet, will 
dance here. They are Darci Kistler and Damian Woetzel. 
</P>
<P>
On the phone from his rehearsal studio last week, Clifford specified that 
Kistler and Woetzel "are not appearing as guest artists, but as alumni (of the 
former company)." 
</P>
<P>
"I did not put them on these performances because I did not want to exploit 
them," Clifford said. "And also so as not to create the impression that this is 
a company that presents guests. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like Los Angeles to see what we have -- also what we had. Many of 
these dancers are Los Angeles people. I live here, and make it my base for 
touring. I am really dedicated to Los Angeles, and this is really an L.A. 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Clifford, 42, says the troupe's three years of touring have been successful in 
that "our tours are strictly no-deficit affairs. When we decide to grow and 
settle down, we will have to face (the reality of) forming a board of directors 
and going into the business of fund raising. But so far, just being a traveling 
company, we have not had to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Where would he like to settle? 
</P>
<P>
"I want to locate where I'm wanted. But, if Los Angeles doesn't want this 
company, there is a lot of interest in Orange County. They certainly want the 
arts down there." 
</P>
<P>
SELLARS IN BOSTON: Every time Peter Sellars starts a new project, Angelenos 
hold their breath. Last weekend Sellars surfaced in Boston to officially 
announce the formation of a company called Boston Opera Theater. Adding this to 
his other ventures here and in Europe, one might wonder how the artistic 
director of the Los Angeles Festival can keep his commitments. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, Sellars' answer to this question was unequivocal. "My major 
commitment is to the L.A. Festival, which is where I live. Here in Boston I am 
only an adviser." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Sellars' only obligation to Boston Opera Theater is to assist in 
reviving his trilogy of Mozart/Da Ponte operas over several seasons, starting 
with "The Marriage of Figaro" in January. After dozens of performances of these 
works, which originated at the PepsiCo Festival in New York, later in Vienna 
and Paris, reviving the productions in Boston will require a minimal time 
commitment, Sellars said. 
</P>
<P>
"These productions, created with a core of artists who make Boston their home, 
have been in a range of cultural capitals but never in Boston. I am pleased 
that a cycle of work, begun seven years ago, reaches its conclusion, at last, 
in our hometown." 
</P>
<P>
Among Sellars' projects is his first film. It's being produced for this year's 
L.A. Festival and is titled "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez." It is Sellars' spoof 
of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," the silent screen Fritz Lang classic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my feature-length silent film in color, with a score by John Adams. It 
will be great. It's going to be shot in June," Sellars said, "on location in 
New York. Then I edit it in July and August and it premieres in Hollywood Bowl 
during the Festival with the Los Angeles Philharmonic playing the John Adams 
score live." 
</P>
<P>
In 1991, he stages the John Adams opera "Klinghoffer," based on the story of 
the American Leon Klinghoffer, who was killed by hijackers on board the Italian 
liner Achille Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
Another frequent Sellars collaborator -- the avant-garde dancer/choreographer 
Mark Morris -- also has a prominent role in "Klinghoffer" as well. The new 
opera will receive its world premiere in Brussels, then goes to Lyons, 
Brooklyn, Los Angeles (for the 1991 festival) and then San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars also confirmed "what the world already knows" that he will stage 
Olivier Messiaen's opera, "St. Francois d'Assise" at the Salzburg Festival in 
1992 in collaboration with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Pending a formal 
announcement from Salzburg, Sellars declined further comment. Peter Catalano 
and David Sweet contributed to this column.

*** DEPECHE MODE "VIOLATOR" SIRE/REPRISE: ALBUM SCALE: ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE 
(A CLASSIC.)

Has success altered Depressed Mood? The Anglo-Angsters' latest starts with 
"World in My Eyes," a downright sensual invocation. The already-been-a-hit 
"Personal Jesus" is apparently an honest-to, well, -God invitation to prayer, 
and "Waiting for the Night" talks mistily about a guiding star. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. "World in My Eyes" ultimately keys on the line "That's all there 
is, nothing more than you can feel now," "Jesus" is followed by the 
Apocalypse-welcoming "Halo" and "Night" anticipates "when everything's dark / 
keeps us from the stark reality." And it's all presented with a tone of 
resigned disgust (see album title). Yes, the world of DM is still bleak 'n' 
blue, colored by that particularly adolescent (but -- let's face it -- fairly 
universal) inability to relate to anything except others who feel the same as 
you. 
</P>
<P>
But solipsistic as it may be, it is a universal feeling, and the Mode has 
captured it as well as ever. On the other hand, "Violator" offers little the 
band hasn't served up before. The music is more Kraftwerkian than ever but the 
melodies remain dirge-like, David Gahan's vocals stay unvaryingly somber, and 
the explicit cathartic quality of the songs is still no more forceful than the 
implicit permission to wallow. STEVE HOCHMAN

POP EYE: MISSION U.K.'S NEW VIDEO FORM: SURVEILLANCE ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When hot British rocker band Mission U.K. begins its American tour April 16, 
the band will have cameramen on hand to film the shows. Hardly surprising, 
right? But the video crew won't be documenting the band's performance. 
</P>
<P>
They'll be filming the security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Hired by local promoters to keep order, security guards have emerged as 
controversial figures in recent years, with fans complaining that instead of 
keeping the peace, they often provoke trouble with overzealous, confrontational 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been taping the band's shows for about six months and, for the most 
part, the idea has worked," said Pamela Burton, Mission U.K.'s co-manager. 
"There's definitely a difference in the way the security guys operate. They 
almost second-guess themselves. You can sometimes actually see them start to 
make a move and then stop, as if they'd said to themselves, 'Oh, yeh, I'm on 
camera!' " 
</P>
<P>
Burton said that the band instituted the policy because its members, especially 
lead singer (and Bono look-alike) Wayne Hussey, felt strongly that security 
guard excesses had sometimes interfered with the group's intense rapport with 
its fans. (Mission U.K. fans often hurl themselves at the stage or form 
triangles by standing on top of each other's shoulders during the show.) 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had problems, even when we last played in L.A. in 1988 at the 
John Anson Ford Theatre," Burton said. "A security guard got really heavy with 
a fan and hurt him -- really hurt him. Wayne stopped the show and wouldn't go 
back on stage until the security guard had left the building." 
</P>
<P>
One night last year, Mission U.K.'s road crew was filming the group when 
another altercation broke out. Hussey grabbed the camera and filmed the guards 
involved in the melee. Since then, members of the crew, or co-manager Tony 
Perrin, have regularly filmed all shows. 
</P>
<P>
The filming policy has served as an effective deterrent. Burton said the group 
had only two incidents on its entire British tour. One was just last weekend in 
Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrendous," Burton said. "A security guard tried to pull a kid off his 
friend's shoulders and knocked him, head first, to the ground, where he split 
his head open. We have it all on film. I'm sure if the incident comes to court, 
our film could be entered as evidence." 
</P>
<P>
So how will American promoters react to this new kind of pop surveillance? 
Burton acknowledged resistance, if not outright opposition, from some 
promoters. 
</P>
<P>
However Avalon Attractions' Moss Jacobs, who is handling the band's May 11 date 
at the Hollywood Palladium, says he doesn't anticipate any problems. "We have 
enormous confidence in our security people, who have always done a tremendous 
job at our shows," Jacobs said. "I don't think the presence of cameras will 
have any effect on the quality of their performance." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Burton insists, "we will absolutely have our cameras rolling when 
we come to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Burton says she's looking out for the interests of her band -- and its fans. 
"I'm not trying to create a confrontation, I'm trying to avoid one," she said. 
"We have great respect for the hard work most security guards do. It's a tough 
job. But when our fans pay hard-earned money to see the group, it's important 
for them to see the group in the fashion they want, even if that means sitting 
on each other's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"By filming the shows, we're trying to create an atmosphere where security 
guards will use courtesy and a light hand instead of pushing our fans around. 
It's a way of saying to security people: 'Don't come to a Mission U.K. concert 
with an attitude. We're watching you.' "

POP EYE: STICKER THIS ITEM: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there was ever a record that deserved a warning label, surely it must be 
Barry White's new single, "I Wanna Do It Good to Ya." But rather than bow to 
increasing pressure from conservative family and church-group activists, 
White's label, A&amp;M Records, has made a point of spotlighting the record's 
risque contents. 
</P>
<P>
(Geez, is it possible they think some controversy might sell a few extra 
records?) At any rate, the label sent several hundred deejays and journalists a 
promotional CD of the pop heavyweight's song, complete with a gift-wrapped 
package filled with 20 condoms and a pair of crotchless lace panties. 
Apparently the censorship blues hasn't cooled local deejay libido yet -- the 
package was such a hit, A&amp;M has had to rush-order a few hundred more. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in the room when our marketing and promotion folks came up with the 
idea," said an A&amp;M press spokeswoman. "But if you see the video, you'd have 
a clear understanding of our marketing strategy." And how. The clip features 
White romancing a woman with pillow talk too explicit to print in a 
mass-circulation newspaper. A&amp;M says the Black Entertainment Network is 
airing the uncensored clip while VH-1 is showing a tamer version of the clip, 
minus White's enthusiastic bedroom patter.

I am writing in response to Gerald Peary's March 4 article on the movie "The 
Handmaid's Tale." 
</P>
<P>
I was appalled by his embracing of stereotypes of fundamentalist Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there are extremist and hypocrites in all religions, but what this 
movie does is depict fundamentalist Christians as tantamount to Nazis. American 
media would not tolerate doing this to any other religion or race.

Re "An Interview With Paramount's Top Guns," March 18: 
</P>
<P>
I found myself feeling a little queasy as I read the interview with producers 
Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. At first I thought a paragraph might have 
been left out . . . something that explained how two men whose claim to fame is 
producing Eddie Murphy spouting obscenities in formula cop-chase comedies (with 
lots of gratuitous violence) and Tom Cruise in puerile macho special-effects 
movies (with lots of gratuitous violence) can actually be publicly 
congratulating themselves for their "aesthetic." 
</P>
<P>
Reading further, I began to suspect self-parody in this wide-ranging interview, 
wherein the reader is told: "I am inclined to be esoteric" and "We're not 
producers for hire." 
</P>
<P>
Why are men this self-deluded, greedy and ignorant rewarded with obscenely huge 
sums of money? Do studio heads really believe Simpson and Bruckheimer have 
talent or taste? No, I'm afraid, to quote Mr. S, "It's beyond the realm of 
caca."

"Born on the Fourth of July" is one of those films that left-wing Hollywood and 
the media rave about, but it boils down to just another anti-American movie. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone portrays his "hero" as the only decent or intelligent American 
soldier and presents Ron Kovic as somehow admirable because he turns against 
America and our ally. 
</P>
<P>
If Hollywood ever wants to get truthful about Vietnam, it should do a movie 
about heroic Americans such as double amputee B.T. Collins, paraplegic Max 
Cleland, the Medal of Honor recipients, any of the 570,000 Vietnam veterans in 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars or any of the 90% of Vietnam veterans who answered 
yes to the 1980 Lou Harris poll asking, "Are you proud of your service in the 
Vietnam War?" 
</P>
<P>
It is revealing that at the movie's end, for any viewers who missed the 
political point, Stone and Kovic dedicate the film to one of the flakiest of 
protesters, the late Abbie Hoffman.

THEATER NOTEBOOK: ON THE STAGE, AN APRIL FILLED WITH SPRING OPENINGS

Passover gets the performance treatment at Highways in Santa Monica on April 
10, when the traditional Seder will be celebrated with a mix of old and new 
ritual: readings from the Haggada both ancient and feminist, Middle 
East-inspired food, performance and music -- on the flute, guitar and 
saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
(The Seder is a religious meal accompanied by the retelling of the Jews' escape 
from Egypt; the Haggada is the biblical narrative.) "Not all of us are Jewish," 
said Robin Podolsky, one of the seven people who assembled the evening. "And 
within those of us who are Jewish, there's a real range. For instance, I'm 
quite secular; my spiritual practice is as eclectic as you can get. Malcolm 
Boyd knows more about liturgy than anyone. And Brian Zeiden is a student of 
religion -- and quite observant." 
</P>
<P>
The unifying intent, she added, "was to consciously re-create the link between 
theater and ritual. For a lot of us, there's a memory and affinity for the 
ritual of Seder -- sitting around the table as a child -- and wanting to say, 
'This is what we do in our lives: tell stories to make sense of the world.' As 
critical thinkers, we try to take those stories apart. As actors we try to put 
the magic back, albeit informed with understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The seven, who for the most part are either gay, lesbian or people with AIDS, 
have also sought to include the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 
inviting a dozen Middle Eastern artists to participate. "The story of the Seder 
is the narrative thread that pulls the evening together," Podolsky said. 
Participants are asked to provide an offering: a music performance or symbolic 
reading, food (only unleavened bread will do) or goods such as candles and 
incense. Admission is $5. 
</P>
<P>

ASSORTED KNOW-IT-ALLS who insist we can't grow lilacs in California evidently 
have never visited 80-acre Margaretten Park in Leona Valley. The private 
arboretum, home to 900 or so varieties of lilacs, is sponsored by the 
International Lilac Society and will be open to the public the weekend of April 
7 and 8 (from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.) and by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to 40 years of careful planting and tending by Dr. Joel Margaretten, the 
park's appropriately named Bouquet Canyon now hosts more than 50,000 of the 
fragrant bushes. History tells us that Marco Polo transported lilacs from China 
to Persia. When he resumed his voyage, he went on to plant the hardy shrub in 
Turkey; the lilac, a relative of the olive tree, flourished in both those warm 
climates. The Austro-Hungarian ambassador to Turkey at the time saw the 
flowering bush in the Sultan's garden in Constantinople and brought it to 
Vienna, where the plant adapted to the European climate. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Margaretten, a semi-retired dentist and passionate lilac grower, has 
re-adapted the lilac bush to a Mediterranean climate and a winterless season by 
withholding water for a portion of the year, thereby allowing the plant to go 
through its natural deciduous cycle of dormancy and rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
The lilacs' Southern California horticultural haven is also home to a handful 
of bullfrogs, a collection of desert mosaics built by the former owner just 
after the turn of the century and a dog named Lilac.

WHEN THEIR AIRBORNE melodies blend with the breezes, aluminum-pipe wind chimes 
have a particularly exotic appeal. They drum up visions of sailboats sliding 
into the waves, the sound of metal against mast. 
</P>
<P>
The shorter ones, 30 inches long, have a light, sweet resonance. As the pipes 
grow longer, the sound becomes louder and deeper. When they reach 64 inches in 
length, they sound like cathedral bells. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Picotte is the one-man master behind Picotte Wind Chimes of Santa 
Barbara. A former furniture and clock maker, he now devotes himself full time 
to making chimes. A purist, Picotte uses only clear-heart redwood for the round 
disk from which he hangs his brushed-metal pipes. The wood is weather-treated 
and holes are grommetted to avoid the chafing of the nylon cord. You will not 
find any anodized aluminum on these wind chimes; according to Picotte, it 
spoils the sound. 
</P>
<P>
The chimes are available in four sizes -- from 30 to 64 inches in length -- 
prices range from $25 to $95, and each comes with a lifetime guarantee. Picotte 
carefully tunes his chimes to a five-tone, pentatonic scale borrowed from Asian 
music.

AUTOBOOKS ETC. AND Automotive Book Stop couldn't be further apart in 
philosophy. But as a pair, the two bookstores have made an unlikely strip of 
Magnolia Boulevard in Burbank a Mecca for car enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
Autobooks Etc. is clean, well-lighted, aloof; Automotive Book Stop is gritty, 
dark, about as friendly as a mechanic's smock. Autobooks Etc. has hundreds of 
glossy new books; Automotive Book Stop has hundreds of gritty used tomes. One 
is Sir Laurence Olivier; the other, Al Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
This odd couple is heaven for auto lovers. From the hefty picture books 
covering everything from Alfa Romeos to Zimmers and the well-stocked selection 
of new periodicals at Autobooks Etc. to the automotive-shop manuals, sales 
brochures and old magazines at Automotive Book Stop, all bases are covered. 
"Our customers come from all walks of life; we have a lot of fun in here just 
talking cars," says Fred Chaparro, owner of Automotive Book Stop. A former 
midget-car racer, Chaparro doesn't stock anything exotic, but promises that he 
can locate just about any book anybody wants. 
</P>
<P>
Autobooks Etc. will also go the extra mile to find books for its customers. "In 
addition to the new books, we carry out-of-print and rare items," says store 
manager Neal East. "We have a lot of people -- we call them 'gearheads' -- who, 
in the middle of a repair or a restoration job, are looking for do-it-yourself 
materials. We can usually help them out." The store also gets a lot of 
once-a-year business (mostly Australian and Asian auto enthusiasts visiting Los 
Angeles from overseas, according to East).

And this being the movie capital of the world, both shops also get a lot of 
studio business, people researching bygone eras for movie and television 
productions, as well as stars who are car nuts. After all, everyone knows that

MOTHER OFF THE HOOK ON BOND WITH BABY

When babies fail to form trusting relationships with their mothers, 
psychologists have long offered a quick answer: Blame Mom. 
</P>
<P>
A new view is taking hold. Some infants -- especially fussy ones -- put up a 
barrier that has nothing to do with their mothers' skills or compassion. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the new wisdom holds: Blame Baby too. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother is off the hook, at least in part," said Dr. Carroll E. Izard. 
</P>
<P>
Delving into infants' emotions has become a rich field of research. 
Developmental psychologists are busy sorting out emotionally responsive infants 
from stoic ones, tracking down the source of emotional responses inside their 
young heads and even measuring which side of babies' faces break into the 
brightest grins and the deepest frowns. 
</P>
<P>
Izard, a researcher at the University of Delaware, is challenging the 
traditional notion that mothers are entirely responsible for building secure 
relationships with their babies. 
</P>
<P>
He has found that babies who respond strongly and negatively to noises and 
other stimulation -- in short, the very fussy ones -- are also most likely to 
develop poor bonds with their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Previous research puts the onus on the mother," said Izard. "I'm saying this 
is a two-way street. Characteristics of the infant contribute as well." 
</P>
<P>
His study, conducted on 81 infants, found that those who cried the most, who 
demanded the most attention and who put up the biggest fuss during mildly 
stressful situations during their first months of life also turned out to be 
the least secure at 13 months of age. 
</P>
<P>
He and his colleagues found that they could use an electrocardiogram to predict 
which newborns would go on to have insecure bonds with their mothers. Those 
with the strongest vagal tone -- a measure of the influence of the brain on the 
heart -- later produced the highest insecurity scores on psychological tests. 
</P>
<P>
In Izard's study, a quarter of the babies formed poor bonds with their mothers. 
Other research has shown that such children are more likely to have 
psychological problems when they reach school age, such as extreme shyness and 
difficulty playing with other youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The latest work suggests that the seeds for these social problems are sewn in a 
baby's genes at birth. 
</P>
<P>
Izard outlined his findings recently at a meeting of the American Assn. for the 
Advancement of Science in New Orleans. Other researchers at the meeting 
described other ways of delving into the earliest emotions of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Dr. Tiffany Field of the University of Miami Medical School has 
tested babies' willingness to mimic grown-ups' facial expressions of happiness, 
anger, sadness and surprise. About 20%, it turns out, are great apers, bursting 
into wide grins and gaping surprise in response to adult cues. Another 20% stay 
stone-faced, while the rest fall somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
"Expressivity is something that is individually different right from the 
start," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nathan A. Fox of the University of Maryland has found that different 
emotions are seated in different sides of babies' brains. He measured 
youngsters' brain waves on EEGs. Among other things, he found that when babies 
smiled at their mothers, the left side of their brains was usually more active, 
while the right side seemed to be busier when they cried in anger. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that learning more about how the frontal lobes of babies' brains 
mature will provide important clues to understanding the development of 
differences in personality.

FIRM'S HONORARIUMS GET CONGRESS' ATTENTION; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: AN EXPORT AND LEASING COMPANY RANKS TOPS IN SPEAKING FEES. LAST YEAR 
LAWMAKERS GOT ABOUT $100,000 TO VISIT ITS N.J. HEADQUARTERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Grover Connell has no Washington office, no full-time lobbyist and no political 
action committee. He doesn't hold fund-raisers for candidates and doesn't like 
to schmooze at political events. But the New Jersey businessman, who runs a 
$1-billion export and leasing company, still has been able to make friends in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
At least once a week, Connell invites a member of Congress to his company's 
headquarters in Westfield, meeting the guest with a limousine at Newark 
Airport, 20 minutes away. Over a buffet lunch, the lawmaker gives company 
executives an overview of what Congress is doing and answers questions, then 
takes home a $2,000 speaking fee. Last year, the Connell Co. gave more 
honorariums to members of Congress than any other company in the nation -- 
about $100,000 worth. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Connell invites his congressional speaker and spouse to spend a 
weekend in nearby New York City at his firm's expense. They stay at a top hotel 
such as the Plaza or the Helmsley Palace, and Connell takes them to dinner, 
too. "We get to spend more time with them, get to know them better," said 
Connell, who is nearly 72, but looks years younger. "We think it's worthwhile, 
and it's within the House rules." 
</P>
<P>
What does he get for his money? According to Connell, he gets information 
essential to his business interests, such as how a planned investment might be 
affected by changes in a government program. He gets access to members of 
Congress when he needs it. And he has the ability to call on members to attend 
a reception for the head of a foreign country where he does business. 
</P>
<P>
"If we spend $100,000 a year on honoraria, that's nothing compared with the 
cost of having a Washington office or hiring a lobbyist. And we think we do 
better," Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Connell said he cannot understand why more of corporate America doesn't do the 
same. "The government is an enormous player in its effect on our business," 
Connell said in an interview at his office. "We think it's worthwhile to know 
which directions we are headed in." 
</P>
<P>
Connell's net worth has been estimated at $350 million, and his company is one 
of the larger private firms in the nation, but little is known about either. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has sold rice and sugar for years, and since the 1970s has diversified 
into such areas as importing processed foods from the Orient, arranging leasing 
deals for railroads, airlines and utilities, and building commercial 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
A company booklet notes that its sales are more than $1 billion a year and 
includes pictures of many of its products and projects, but not of its chief 
executive. Connell said he doesn't seek publicity. And his style belies his 
wealth. For instance, he shares his office with his son, Ted, and another 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
But Connell isn't shy about his political giving. He and his wife, Pat, each 
make the maximum $25,000 a year in personal political donations to federal 
campaigns, he said. He also gave $200,000 in corporate funds -- over a 
four-year period -- to help build a media center for the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee when it was headed by his friend, then-Rep. 
Tony Coelho of California. 
</P>
<P>
Connell said he doesn't ask his speakers for special legislative favors. It's 
enough, he said, to get a sense of "the current direction of the country" in 
the agricultural, trade and tax policy fields that affect his company. And he 
gets it delivered in person, "with all the nuances," he said. "We think this 
gives us a perspective others don't have." 
</P>
<P>
At times, Connell has used his extensive contacts on Capitol Hill in ways that 
bolster his business interests. He was especially close to the late Rep. Otto 
Passman (D-La.), for years the chairman of the House Appropriations 
subcommittee that controls the foreign aid budget. In the 1970s, Passman 
pressured foreign governments on Connell's behalf. More recently, Connell has 
invited members of Congress to receptions that he has sponsored for the 
controversial president of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. foreign aid to Zaire, which has rich mineral resources but one of the 
smallest per capita incomes in the world, has been limited because of 
congressional concerns about human rights abuses and corruption. For instance, 
Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee 
on Africa, said at a hearing last year he had seen evidence "that literally 
hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars have vanished into the hands of 
the president (Mobutu) and his collaborators." 
</P>
<P>
Connell's firm has sold rice to Zaire for many years and a few years ago 
solicited a contract to supply equipment for Zaire's state-run mining company, 
Gecamines. "I consider Mobutu a personal friend and I admire a lot of what he's 
done," Connell said. "He created a nation. . . . I don't think Zaire has a 
severe human rights problem. I think he's being falsely accused. And corruption 
is a problem everywhere in the Third World." 
</P>
<P>
Connell said introducing members of Congress to the African leader "creates 
goodwill certainly" with Mobutu. But he said his motive wasn't to help cement 
his business ties. "We were trying to do something that would give members of 
Congress a better understanding of what he (Mobutu) was actually like." 
</P>
<P>
"I went because Grover asked me," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) in 
a comment echoed by other lawmakers who attended the receptions. "I didn't go 
to meet the prime minister or president of Zaire. I didn't even know who he 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Connell said he became active in Washington in the early 1970s. His firm was 
named Connell Rice &amp; Sugar Co. at the time, and it dominated the 
government-supported Food for Peace market in rice. His first donations and 
speech payments were directed mostly to members from the rice-growing districts 
of California, Arkansas and Louisiana. One of his early honorarium payments, 
for example, was $1,000 to Passman for a July 24, 1975, visit to Westfield. 
</P>
<P>
Connell's relationship with Passman was laid out in a House investigation of 
South Korean influence-buying in Congress in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The final report said Passman pressed Connell's business interests in several 
countries. Passman, who was defeated in 1976 and acquitted of criminal charges 
in the scandal, told a federal investigator that he forced the Koreans to hire 
a Connell shipping company by threatening to cut off foreign aid if they 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
Connell said he has never been as close to a member of Congress as he was to 
Passman. "He was the most unique personality I ever met in my life and 
eccentric to the extreme. . . . He did speak for us. There's no question about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Connell's sales of rice to South Korea provided millions of dollars in 
commissions for Korean agent Tongsun Park, who gave some of the money back to 
members of Congress, including Passman, in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Connell was indicted on fraud, racketeering and perjury charges alleging that 
he agreed to pay Park $600,000 in commissions and then covered up the secret 
agreement by sending the payments to the offshore bank account of a Korean 
company. Connell denied that he knew the payments were going to Park. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were dropped when Park, who was a key witness in the case, changed 
his testimony, the Justice Department said at the time. Connell said recently, 
as he did after the indictment, that he was unjustly accused. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a State Department official told Congress that Connell had threatened 
to use his influence in Congress to cut off foreign aid to South Korea if the 
Koreans didn't buy his rice. Connell says he never made any such claim. 
</P>
<P>
During the last decade, world rice markets have softened and Connell has 
diversified his business into leasing and real estate development. He expanded 
his list of honorarium recipients as well. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, his firm gave out $11,000 in speaking fees to 11 members of Congress. 
By 1985, the amount had increased to $60,000 for 30 members. By 1987, the 
figure had grown to $84,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Connell's close friends in the House, Coelho and Rep. Bill Alexander 
(D-Ark.), helped Connell build up his speakers' list by suggesting other House 
members as speakers, according to invitation letters that Connell sent to 
several members in 1985. The letters referred to the program as "The Congress" 
seminars and asked members to talk about "ongoing legislative activities of 
primary interest to us such as those affecting agriculture, foreign trade, 
taxes and the economy." 
</P>
<P>
The most frequent guests at the Connell honorarium program over the years have 
been Alexander, who represents a major rice-growing district, with at least 
nine visits, and Reps. Matthew J. Rinaldo (R-N.J.) and Rep. Julian C. Dixon 
(D-Los Angeles), with eight appearances each. Connell's headquarters is in 
Rinaldo's district, while Dixon served for years on a key appropriations panel. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said in an interview that his speeches at Connell's company usually deal 
with what Congress is doing, as well as the outlook for foreign aid, because he 
served on that appropriations subcommittee. "A lot of members enjoy Grover's 
program because he's not lobbying you on any particular issue," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the receptions that he has hosted for Mobutu, Connell recently 
arranged for four House members to visit Zaire. The four -- Reps. Robert G. 
Torricelli (D-N.J.), Robert J. Mrazek (D-N.Y.), Mike Espy (D-Miss.) and Bill 
Lowery (R-San Diego) -- have appeared at his honorarium program, and Connell 
also has made campaign contributions to the three Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Congress paid for the air travel to Zaire, with Mobutu's government paying for 
travel and lodging within the country. The visit included a private luncheon 
with Mobutu aboard his riverboat. Mrazek said the congressmen raised their 
concerns about reports of human rights violations and corruption in the African 
nation. Connell, but not the U.S. ambassador, was at the luncheon, Mrazek said. 
</P>
<P>
Torricelli said that Connell "offered assistance for getting access to Mobutu 
and the region." He said he knew Connell had "a close personal relationship" 
with Mobutu but didn't know the details. "The activities of one businessman are 
not my concern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the House has voted to bar its members from keeping honorariums after 
this year, Connell said he will continue inviting members to Westfield to speak 
and will offer to donate the $2,000 fee to charity. "What their reaction will 
be, we'll just have to wait and see," he said.

EGYPTIANS MAY BUILD CABLE CAR UP MOUNTAIN OF 10 COMMANDMENTS 
</P>

ST. CATHERINE, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly 2,000 years, pilgrims have followed the footsteps of Moses up, up, 
up the mystic mountain of the 10 Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
As tourists outnumber pilgrims more and more, Egyptian officials have a plan to 
let climbers bypass many of the 3,750 stone steps to Mt. Sinai's summit laid by 
centuries of monks. 
</P>
<P>
A cable car, they say, would make for a quicker and easier trip up the 
mountain, which is sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the government's Misr Sinai Tourist Co. believe that such an 
attraction would help increase tourism and provide Egypt's hungry economy with 
much-needed dollars. Opponents object on religious, spiritual, historical and 
environmental grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a holy place. It belongs to the world," said Greek Orthodox Archbishop 
Damianos, head of the Monastery of St. Catherine, which has stood at the 
mountain's base for 1,400 years. 
</P>
<P>
Abdel Azim A. Bassiouni, Misr Sinai's chairman and chief advocate of the cable 
car, replied: "We Egyptians are very religious. It's unrealistic to think that 
technology has no place in sacred places. We cannot bring it here if (it would) 
destroy the sanctity or the solitude." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the 2,500-foot climb up Mt. Sinai was not meant to be 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the Christian era, as pious men in Egypt developed the practice that 
became known as monasticism, self-denial and the search for solitude brought 
the first hermits to caves in Sinai's rocky walls. Today, one hermit-monk still 
lives in the hills, in the name of sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, at sunrise and sunset, scores of outsiders wind their way to a 
chapel atop Mt. Sinai dedicated to the Holy Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
Misr Sinai's cable car, designed by Egyptian and Swiss engineers, would 
facilitate their trek, ascending 1,650 feet up adjoining Mt. Safsafa. 
</P>
<P>
From the upper terminal, tourists would continue to the top of Mt. Sinai on 
foot. The two-minute ride would cut 45 minutes from the usual 2 1/2-hour climb. 
</P>
<P>
The project's cost of $2.3 million would be financed by the Ministry of 
Housing, Utilities and New Communities. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Safsafa is a few hundred yards from the Monastery of St. Catherine. Across 
a paved road from the prospective cable car's lower terminal is the chapel of 
the Prophet Aaron, built where legend says the restless Israelites donated 
their jewelry to build a golden calf. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Testament stories of Moses, the Burning Bush and the mountain of the 10 
Commandments have made the area holy to believers since early times. 
</P>
<P>
In 330, the Byzantine empress Helena dedicated a chapel to the Virgin Mary in 
the shelter of the Sinai peaks. 
</P>
<P>
Two hundred years later, Emperor Justinian ordered a great walled fortress 
built around the site of the Burning Bush. The fort remains as the Monastery of 
St. Catherine, a living relic for the 13 Greek Orthodox monks who call it home. 
</P>
<P>
It has been protected by Crusaders, the Muslim Prophet Mohammed, Arab rulers, 
Napoleon and, in this century, the Israeli and Egyptian governments. 
</P>
<P>
Priceless collections of icons and manuscripts, and a library second in 
religious importance only to the Vatican's, make St. Catherine's a major 
antiquities treasure. 
</P>
<P>
As traditional keepers of the area's hills, chapels, caves and tombs, the monks 
oppose the cable car. They already must deal with up to 100 visitors a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at all this beauty," said Archbishop Damianos, sitting in the stillness 
of his monastery office. "The Egyptian government can make the project because 
they can force it, but we do not agree. We've never agreed to it." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did 10 people asked as they stood with several dozen others near the 
chapel atop Mt. Sinai, awaiting the famous sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
A Michigan student attending American University in Cairo, who did not want his 
name used, said he has experienced the sunrise five times, but "if they build a 
cable car, I'll never come again." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to climb up," said Dirk Glaesmann of West Germany. "You feel a 
part of the mountain. If you put up a cable car, the whole thing would lose its 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian environmentalist, Mohammed Kassas of Cairo University, believes 
that the cable car would be an eyesore where there now is beauty. 
</P>
<P>
"If they wanted to pick a worse place to put the cable car, they couldn't find 
it," Kassas said.

CURIOUS FLOCK TO SEE HONG KONG'S TEEMING WALLED CITY BEFORE DEMOLITION BEGINS;

<P>
HONG KONG'S WALLED CITY DRAWS CURIOUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The notorious Walled City, a squalid enclave whose dark alleyways once were the 
domain of prostitutes, opium addicts and fugitives, is attracting tourists and 
students these days. 
</P>
<P>
They wind through virtual tunnels made by buildings squeezed too close together 
for sunlight or vehicles to enter. They dodge open sewers and dripping pipes in 
the rancid air to see the sinkhole of vice before it becomes a park. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong announced plans three years ago to raze the seven-acre district, just 
a short walk from the international airport, as soon as its 33,000 residents 
could be relocated. Officials believe that it was the world's most densely 
populated area. 
</P>
<P>
The city wall itself won't come tumbling down. Japanese occupation forces took 
it apart during World War II and used the stones for an airport runway. 
</P>
<P>
Since the plans to make a park were announced, "we have had almost daily 
busloads of tourists visiting the Walled City," said Herman Cho, an official of 
the relocation program. "You cannot deny the Walled City has unique features." 
</P>
<P>
Many groups venture only to the perimeter to take pictures of the jumble of 
high-rise buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Other tourists walk alleyways slick with water dripping from a canopy of 
overhead pipes for closer inspection of a slum that, despite its wretchedness, 
is rich in history. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the worst slums in New York and they're not this bad," said 
Christopher Lok, 15, of Ridgefield, Conn., touring the neighborhood with his 
10th-grade classmates from the Hong Kong International School. 
</P>
<P>
The enclave on the Kowloon Peninsula across the harbor from Hong Kong island 
once was a Qing dynasty fort and administrative center protected by a 13-foot 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
In 1898, Britain leased Kowloon from China for 99 years along with Hong Kong, 
but the two countries could not agree on who would control the Walled City. 
</P>
<P>
Few problems arose for half a century because the seven acres were sparsely 
populated, but thousands of squatters poured into the contested neighborhood 
after World War II, claiming that they were under Chinese jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's colonial government, which did not want to antagonize Beijing, seldom 
bothered them. The result has been relative chaos in a very small space. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Walled City have not paid property taxes or registered their 
businesses, which include dozens of unlicensed dentists and doctors. They have 
put up buildings without government approval, which are crammed with people who 
cannot afford the higher rents elsewhere in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
When Britain agreed that Hong Kong would be returned to China in 1997, the 
jurisdictional dispute evaporated and the colonial government announced plans 
to demolish its main urban eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 14,000 residents have moved out of the Walled City under a compensation 
program costing the equivalent of $295 million, and the process is expected to 
be complete by mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
The brothels, opium dens and gambling halls have long since gone, and officials 
say walking the maze of dim, dank lanes is safe. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely does one meet a character more sinister than a schoolgirl on her way to 
class or see anything more frightening than a rat. On certain afternoons, 
several men play classical Chinese music on traditional instruments in a room 
off Old Folks Road, the main alley. 
</P>
<P>
There are no maps, and the alleys are marked only in Chinese, but it is 
difficult to get lost. Most paths eventually lead to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Factories producing food, such as fish balls and noodles, are everywhere. 
Sweating, bare-chested men in their 20s, wearing boots because of the muck on 
the floor, make small blocks of coagulated pig blood in one shop. 
</P>
<P>
Across the lane, Madame Chan, 58, sits in a bamboo chair all day in front of a 
cell-sized apartment for which she pays the equivalent of $51 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"The ventilation is very poor and that makes me ill," she complains.

AIRPORT PLANS RUFFLE FEATHERS OF BIRD FANCIERS; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: BALD EAGLES HAVE ESTABLISHED A NESTING SITE NEARBY. CONSERVATION 
GROUPS WANT THE NEW DENVER FACILITY TO FORM A NATURE SANCTUARY.

<P>
A pair of bald eagles is on a collision course with Denver's new $2.3-billion 
airport, and conservationists say the eagles and 330 other bird species that 
nest at Barr Lake State Park could be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists and wildlife officials want Denver International Airport to 
establish a buffer-zone nature sanctuary to prevent houses, offices and shops 
from sprouting up on its northwestern fringes near Barr Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The airport, which opens in 1993, will not pay. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel we should," said airport director Bill Smith. "We aren't adding 
anything to the problems in the area, and we're not increasing any problems 
that exist." 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts are surprised that the birds chose to nest just 18 miles from 
downtown Denver, and 3 miles northwest of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The eagles were the first on record to nest and to colonize on the Rocky 
Mountains' eastern slopes in 1986. Previously, the eastern Colorado Front Range 
served only as a resting stop for eagles migrating south from Canada toward 
Mexico, New Mexico and Texas for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
The birth of two eaglets last year drew numerous bird watchers. The eaglets 
later flew off, and wildlife officials are hopeful they will soon return to 
nest. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only 10 bald eagle nesting sites in the whole state, and only one 
along the Front Range," said Mike Carter, director of the Colorado Bird 
Observatory. "Don't airport officials understand the principle of the straw 
that broke the camel's back?" 
</P>
<P>
Carter worried that the airport will destroy a unique opportunity for the 
endangered bald eagles to grab a foothold if it refuses to help out. 
</P>
<P>
If the worst happens, the construction of the airport's fringe developments 
would at least enable observers to document the destruction of a bird refuge, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been very few studies with 80 to 90 years of records, and this 
could be our first chance to document these changes," Carter said. "I don't see 
that as a benefit. This could destroy 100 years worth of resources." 
</P>
<P>
The airport already has concluded in a $35,000 study that, because of the 
airport's noise regulations, incoming planes will not pose a threat. But 
construction near Barr Lake may drive the birds away, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Barr Lake Park is made up of 2,000 acres of water and two narrow strips of land 
on each side that measure 700 acres. Wildlife records from the area have been 
kept since 1909, and 330 species are documented. 
</P>
<P>
Warning signs prohibit entry to the eagles' nesting area, and violators face a 
$20,000 fine and a year's imprisonment. But outdoors enthusiasts can cross a 
narrow ridge and watch the birds through binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Audubon Society and Colorado Department of Natural Resources want 
the airport to put aside some of its discretionary funds for wildlife 
conservation to buy a 2,000-acre buffer zone around the lake, or buy 
development rights to prevent construction there. 
</P>
<P>
The land's cost has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
"All the buffer zone will do is keep developers away from the lake," said its 
chairwoman, Polly Reetz. "In addition to the eagles, we have a lot of animals 
that move in and out, and raptors that hunt in fields adjacent to the park." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, of the Colorado Bird Observatory, would prefer a wildlife sanctuary on 
the airport grounds, a 2,000-foot-wide zone stretching from the airport to the 
nearby Rocky Mountain Arsenal, which already serves as a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Denver planners are negotiating with the Army, which owns the arsenal, to move 
fences and allow bike trails in the area to take advantage of arsenal wildlife, 
which include antelope, deer and coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
The airport is being constructed to replace Denver's Stapleton International, 
one of the nation's busiest. It will occupy 50 square miles, and its main 
terminal will be heavily landscaped with greenery to promote the image of an 
oasis on the plains. Indoor waterfalls and fountains also are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said that without action, development will occur around the lake because 
of plans to complete a beltway around Denver. But he thinks the state and 
conservation groups should share with the airport the cost of protecting the 
birds and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Park spokeswoman Carol Leasure said farmers and landowners should not be 
penalized if airport-fringe developments are deferred. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see that they're fairly compensated too," she said.

TEXAN GUNNING FOR MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNORSHIP;

<P>
POLITICS: JOHN SILBER'S TAKE-NO-PRISONERS STYLE RAISES HACKLES AND 
CONSCIOUSNESS AMONG MORE GENTEEL BAY STATERS.

<P>
John Silber's most distinctive feature is not his deformed right arm, a stump 
he learned to use as a weapon in schoolyard scraps. 
</P>
<P>
What is most physically striking are the furrows that crease his face, 
especially when he argues. 
</P>
<P>
And those furrows are likely to deepen in the coming weeks as this Kant scholar 
who whipped Boston University into shape goes after the Democratic nomination 
for governor of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old philosopher-turned-politician, a wiry man who stands just 5 
feet 7, will take on anyone in an argument. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it. I love it. It's a sport," he said, seated in his Spartan campaign 
office furnished with rented green leather couches, his blue eyes framed by a 
full head of brown hair. "It's a participation sport. Some people like fencing, 
and I like arguing. Obviously I like arguing." 
</P>
<P>
A transplanted Texan now serving as president of Boston University, Silber is 
the squeaky wheel in a four-way race for the job that a politically weary Gov. 
Michael S. Dukakis no longer wants. 
</P>
<P>
His competitors at the Democratic Party convention June 1-2 will be the 
lieutenant governor, a former state attorney general and a state lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
In his native Texas they would call John Silber a maverick. Argumentative as a 
child, combative as a scholar and daring as a university administrator, he is 
stirring up a storm of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
First he complained about the state's welfare largess and Cambodian immigrants 
in a way some people thought smacked of racism. Then he shared his views on 
alcoholism in a way critics said trivialized the problem. 
</P>
<P>
And he raised hackles when he called Jews racist during an interview in which 
he recalled his attraction to Judaism as a 21-year-old divinity student at Yale 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Silber said he considered converting but decided not to do so when he 
discovered "the racism of Jews is quite phenomenal" in treating converts as 
"second-class." It was more than 10 years later, after his father died, that 
Silber learned his father was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Silber fought back against the critics. He said he was misquoted, misunderstood 
and a victim of media distortion. He pointed out his unwavering support for 
minorities and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But if some in reserved New England call Silber a provocative outsider, that's 
the way he likes it. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks voters like it, too, and that the confrontational style he was weaned 
on in Texas works here as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It also gets the point across in Massachusetts," he said. "It may not be the 
style that some reporters like. It may not be the style that some people in 
universities like. But it's a style that the taxpayers like a very great deal." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Silber is learning to turn down the fire on the hustings. After the 
first explosive weeks, he began minding what he said. He seems to have heeded 
his 95-year-old mother, who he said told him: "Son, your tongue will be your 
ruin." 
</P>
<P>
A wittier, circumspect John Silber demonstrated what he has learned on the 
campaign trail at a breakfast early in March with 150 members of the Lexington 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming to Massachusetts 19 years ago, he began, "I tried to tell the 
truth and shame the devil. Now I've heard I have to charm a few people at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
He cracked a joke about the once-touted Massachusetts economic miracle. "A 
miracle is a phenomenon for which there is no rational explanation. We had a 
Massachusetts mirage." 
</P>
<P>
The audience loved it. 
</P>
<P>
Many said they came out of curiosity to hear the one interesting candidate 
around. 
</P>
<P>
But they were enchanted after he said how he wanted to overhaul the state 
budget process to tighten spending and efficiency, how he wanted to weed out 
waste in state operations and "put an end to amateur hour" in running state 
agencies, how he was committed to improving education and stimulating the state 
economy with tax incentives. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a German architect and a Texas schoolteacher, Silber is fond of 
saying he has been a Democrat since he was 10. He also voted for Republican 
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. He labels himself both a populist and 
an elitist. 
</P>
<P>
And for a political novice, he has shown a politician's flair in making over 
Boston University and taking his message of education reform on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I could be speaking every night in this state, and that was before I announced 
for governor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If you haven't heard him speak, you can read: His book, "Straight Shooting: 
What's Wrong With America and How to Fix It," was published last year by Harper 
&amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
Silber was educated at Trinity University in his hometown, San Antonio, and at 
Yale. He has six daughters and a son. 
</P>
<P>
He was 44 when he took over Boston University 19 years ago. He had just been 
fired as dean of arts and sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, after 
years of discord between him and the Board of Regents over changes made in his 
department and his criticism of university policies. 
</P>
<P>
As the president of Boston University, he transformed an academically uneven, 
debt-burdened school into a solid institution with 26,000 students, an 
endowment of $183 million and a budget nearing $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The early years of his term at the university were rough. Silber fought with 
faculty over politics, labor organizing and tenure. He survived attempted 
faculty coups and revolts. 
</P>
<P>
Students and civil libertarians protested when he ordered the removal of 
anti-apartheid banners from dormitory windows and he limited overnight dorm 
visits by members of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
Silber wants to govern the state because, he said, he knows a better way and 
because he thinks public service is an obligation. If it gets any deeper than 
that, he won't say. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people who can serve and who can afford to take the financial 
sacrifice necessary to serve, every now and then, ought to do so." 
</P>
<P>
As president of Boston University, Silber gets $275,000 a year and a house. The 
governor earns $75,000 and that's it. Massachusetts provides no governor's 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people wouldn't give up $200,000," Silber said. "I don't give a fig 
for money in that sense. Money never gave anybody a meaningful life." 
</P>
<P>
William Goetzmann, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian at the University of 
Texas, was on the faculty when Silber was running things there in 1969-70. 
Goetzmann is no Silber chum, but he respects him. 
</P>
<P>
"I would regard him as a tough person, and yet underneath the sort of tough 
initial appearance or manner he can also be reasoned with," Goetzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Goetzmann said Silber reminds him of Dukakis with that "sort of steely-eyed 
determination." 
</P>
<P>
"He puts all his guns on the bar," Goetzmann said. "He is a doer." 
</P>
<P>
Silber has the support of Senate President William Bulger, one of the most 
powerful people at the Statehouse, and former Boston Mayor Kevin White, now a 
Boston University faculty member.

SISTER THEA BOWMAN; WORKED ON BEHALF OF BLACKS, WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sister Thea Bowman, the Roman Catholic nun who was sometimes called "a black 
American Mother Teresa" for her efforts on behalf of blacks and women, has died 
after a long struggle with cancer. She was 52. 
</P>
<P>
She died Friday at her home in Canton, Miss., near Jackson. The lecturer, 
evangelist, poet and singer had first suffered breast cancer several years ago 
and had been confined to a wheelchair since the disease spread to her bones. 
</P>
<P>
The granddaughter of a slave, Sister Bowman was the only black member of the 
Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration. 
</P>
<P>
She had won national recognition for her work with children as director of the 
Office of Intercultural Awareness in the Jackson diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Bowman was also on the faculty of the Institute of Black Catholic 
Studies at Xavier University in New Orleans and lectured widely, spreading her 
message that "people are gifted, that black is beautiful, and that 
cross-cultural collaboration enriches both education and living." 
</P>
<P>
Education, she said last year when the Sister Thea Bowman Black Catholic 
Educational Foundation was established to aid minority youth, "is the way out 
of homelessness, out of helplessness, out of fear and ignorance. It is the way 
out of crime and out of hunger." 
</P>
<P>
Popular at conventions and seminars as well as in her own office and classroom, 
Sister Bowman often sang her messages. In 1983, she enhanced her national 
reputation when she recorded an album of black spirituals, "Sister Thea: Songs 
of My People." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Bowman was to receive the Laetare Medal, the oldest and most prestigious 
award given to U.S. Catholics, May 20 at the commencement program of Notre Dame 
University. The award will be given posthumously, the university announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As a child in Canton, a small rural town in central Mississippi, Sister Bowman 
attended Holy Child Jesus School, run by the Franciscan order she later joined. 
She converted to Catholicism and entered the convent in 10th grade because she 
was so impressed by the sisters' efforts to change racist attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
The recipient of several honorary degrees, Sister Bowman earned her bachelor's 
degree at Viterbo College and her master's and doctoral degrees at the Catholic 
University of America.

TRIS COFFIN; ACTING CAREER LONG, VARIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tris Coffin, a character actor and sometimes leading man who appeared in 
literally hundreds of low budget Westerns, movie serials and television shows, 
died Monday, his wife, Vera, said. 
</P>
<P>
He was 80 and had retired from acting about eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He died in a Santa Monica hospital of lung cancer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Coffin's best-known sustaining role probably came more than 30 years ago, when 
he played Capt. Tom Rynning, in "26 Men," a true tale of a handful of 
Texas-style rangers trying to maintain law and order in Arizona at the turn of 
the century. In fact, there were only 26 of them because the Arizona Territory 
couldn't afford any more. The TV series ran 78 episodes in 1957-59. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Mammoth, Utah, as Tristram Coffin to an old American family, he studied 
drama there and then became a radio newscaster in Boston where first his voice 
and then his rugged good looks attracted the attention of Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
The first of his nearly 400 films was "Queen of the Yukon" in 1939. For the 
next 30 years he was seen in "Lady in the Dark," "Flamingo Road," "The 
Fountainhead," "Baron of Arizona," "The Eddie Cantor Story," "Good Neighbor 
Sam," "Man in the Gray Flannel Suit" and dozens of Westerns with such titles as 
"Prairie Gunsmoke" and "Last Stagecoach West." 
</P>
<P>
He was featured in the film serials "Jungle Girl," "Jesse James Rides Again," 
"The Green Hornet" and "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Coffin normally played villains but in 1949 became "King of the Rocketmen," a 
crime-fighter who attained flight because of a rocket-propelled jacket.

ACTIVIST TOURING U.S. TO PROMOTE RECONCILIATION, PROGRESS IN N. IRELAND; 
</P>
<P>
ULSTER: BERNADETTTE DEVLIN MCALISKEY SAYS THAT IF WALLS CAN COME DOWN IN 
GERMANY, WHY NOT IN IRELAND? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, the 1960's firebrand defender of Catholic rights 
in Northern Ireland, is visiting several American cities in coming weeks. Her 
return to the United States after several years marks the rekindling of 
interest in Northern Ireland politics among Irish-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The eloquent Devlin is likely to strike a responsive note -- in a way no other 
Irish activist can -- among the faithful, who number in the tens of millions of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"People come out for Bernadette and get working in Irish issues who won't come 
out for anyone else," says Sean Prendiville, a San Francisco Irish-American 
activist. "She inspires people because of all that she has been through." 
</P>
<P>
Devlin's political resume is dramatic. Elected to the British Parliament at 21 
-- the youngest member since William Pitt in 1781 -- her maiden speech 
mesmerized a normally raucous House of Commons. She was dragged from the House 
floor after punching Britain's home secretary, who had barred her from speaking 
about a 1972 massacre of Irish civilians by British troops. While a member of 
Parliament, she served four months in prison for inciting a riot. 
</P>
<P>
Devlin's activism ended abruptly in 1981 when she and her husband were shot by 
members of a Protestant paramilitary group at their farmhouse near Belfast. 
After a long recovery, she now leads the newly formed Irish National Congress, 
which sponsors reconciliation projects between Catholics and Protestants and 
lobbies for steps that may prompt eventual reunification of the island. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Devlin, 42, said the changes in Eastern Europe have 
spawned optimism for changes in Ireland. "The fervor for democracy and the 
rights of small nations that have been trampled on permeates Ireland despite 
(British Prime Minister) Margaret Thatcher," Devlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Devlin noted, while "everybody's talking about it," the comparison 
of radical change in Eastern Europe with the Irish situation cannot be made in 
the British press because of censorship laws. 
</P>
<P>
That comparison is also being made in America. Susan Murray, an Irish-American 
activist who arranged a speaking engagement for McAliskey at Harvard University 
on April 5, says there is "a lot of excitement and cautious optimism about 
Ireland now because walls are coming down everywhere else. If it can happen in 
Germany, why not in Ireland?" 
</P>
<P>
Devlin will visit Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles, three hotbeds of 
Irish-American activism. That activism, she said, has provided "a major 
contribution" in focusing attention on British human rights abuses and helping 
to curb Catholic unemployment in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
She praised the MacBride principles as particularly helpful. The principles, 
the focus of Irish-American activism in recent years, are in effect in 14 
states and 24 U.S. cities. Under the guidelines, funds controlled by the state 
or municipal governments are barred from being invested in companies that 
practice employment discrimination in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
High unemployment among the Catholic minority -- as much as 70% in some 
Catholic neighborhoods -- has been one of the primary causes of the "troubles" 
that have led to thousands of violent deaths in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Devlin's U.S. visit comes at a time when there is renewed interest in Irish 
politics and culture among Irish-Americans. Tom Hansen, a member of the Ancient 
Order of Hibernians in Los Angeles, says new Irish immigrants -- as many as 
200,000 in the last 10 years -- and "popular culture" are inspiring new 
generations of younger Irish-Americans. He cites the songs of such pop groups 
as Stiff Little Fingers, Boomtown Rats and U2, and the growth of Irish-American 
clubs like the Ancient Order, which has grown from two to seven chapters in the 
Los Angeles area in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the Ulster Gaelic Club is a new organization made up of 
recent immigrants and younger second- and third-generation Irish-Americans. 
They focus on rugby and Irish politics. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, Irish-Americans have played a key role in Irish politics -- 
providing money and manpower for the Irish Rebellion in 1916 that led to a free 
Irish Republic. The first prime minister of the new republic was born in 
Brooklyn, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high-profile arrests of Irish-Americans in recent years for 
gunrunning to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in northern Ireland, such 
incidents are not typical of the Irish-American political scene. Devlin herself 
is not associated with the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
Irish-American activism mainly involves protests against British measures to 
contain the violence in Northern Ireland -- including internment without trial, 
suspension of habeas corpus, and prohibitions against media reporting of 
anti-British views. Another goal is to allow opponents of British policies to 
speak in the United States.

CENSUS DEJA VU: HOMELESSNESS STILL THE NATION'S MOST VISIBLE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
There have been a few success stories among the homeless in the 10 years or so 
since Americans first recognized that, besides discharged mental patients and 
vagrants addicted to alcohol and other drugs, thousands of their fellow 
citizens were living on the streets because of economic circumstances beyond 
their control. 
</P>
<P>
Jack's story, in many ways, is typical -- except that it has a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find work in the Midwest where he grew up, Jack heard about jobs in 
Colorado. On the way there, his old car broke down and he finished the trip by 
hitchhiking. Finally, he was dropped off at the bus station in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"I had $2 and some change in my pocket. I was in a position in my life that I'd 
never been in before: I had no idea what to do," said Jack, who wouldn't give 
his last name because he doesn't want fellow workers to know about his past. 
</P>
<P>
"I prayed that night, I'll tell you," he recalled. Then, in a lottery for 
limited space, he won a bed -- and a new start -- in a shelter called Samaritan 
House. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter's employment program helped steer him into temporary work moving 
furniture while he looked for a job with a future. Samaritan House helped him 
save money, too, through budget counseling and by allowing him to stay on after 
he began earning money. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Jack has his own apartment. He is shopping for furniture. He is a 
manager at a fast-food restaurant. Now, Kathy Rembert at Samaritan House said, 
"he calls me when he has openings." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there have been setbacks, even tragedies. Last November in 
Boston, a war veteran got off the streets and into a nursing home -- after his 
frostbitten hands and feet had to be amputated. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of homelessness is visible on the streets of every major city and 
hidden in the country in shacks without heat or plumbing. It persists after 
billions of dollars have been spent on shelters and emergency aid, after polls 
have shown that Americans want an urgent response from the government. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has called homelessness a national tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
After years in which advocates for the homeless accused the government of 
indifference, the Bush Administration has pressed for full financing of 
programs under the Stewart B. McKinney Act, the main homeless-aid effort, which 
Congress passed in 1987, and has proposed other ways of reaching out to 
homeless mental patients, alcoholics and other addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Those projects are part of a program called Home Ownership and Opportunity for 
People Everywhere (HOPE). Bush's budget proposal for the coming year includes 
about $1.2 billion for this program, nearly $250 million of it earmarked for 
the "hard-to-serve" homeless. The rest would be used mainly for low-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The federal homeless program would provide for up to five years of rent 
subsidies for people in communities that match the assistance with 
rehabilitative services. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration is committed to ending homelessness," said Anna Kondratas, 
assistant secretary of housing and urban development, "and we're going to be 
prepared to do what it takes to get the homeless into permanent housing and to 
get them the kind of services they need to stay in that housing." 
</P>
<P>
Some homeless advocates are less than impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a turn-around of extremely modest proportions" from the policies of the 
Ronald Reagan Administration, said Maria Foscarinis, who heads the National Law 
Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The low-income housing portion of Bush's proposal, she said, is "extremely 
small . . . when you consider all the cuts that have been made over the past 
few years." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that reductions in federal appropriations for low-income housing in 
the 1980s contributed to homelessness, although HUD officials say that spending 
merely was shifted from new construction to rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Also mentioned as a contributing factors are the loss of formerly low-rent, 
rooming house-type apartments to "gentrification," the release of thousands of 
mental patients from state institutions and "economic dislocation" due to 
massive unemployment forcing people to move in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
The recent census of the shelters and streets was intended to improve the 
accuracy of estimates of the homeless population, currently put at between 
250,000 and 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Conference of Mayors survey last year found that demand for shelter 
space had risen 25% within one year; those involved in shelter projects say 
that trend is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems like it's a never-ending thing," said Joe Flaherty, whose shelter in 
Little Rock, Ark., directed 254 residents to full-time jobs last year and 211 
the year before. His shelter is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Doss, who oversees a shelter in Port Gibson, Miss., spoke of rural 
homelessness: "We have people in abandoned cars and abandoned shacks . . . 
living without electricity, without heat, without plumbing." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, McKinney Act funds and other federal appropriations for the 
homeless have amounted to more than $1.78 billion, according to HUD statistics. 
Spending by states, communities and private donors have added millions to that 
total. 
</P>
<P>
Still, said Fred Griesbach, executive director of the National Coalition for 
the Homeless in New York, basic issues remain unaddressed. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly large allocations such as the HOPE project need to be seen in 
perspective, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at $250 million and say that's a lot of money," he said, but not 
when compared to the what is being spent on savings-and-loan failures. "They're 
willing to put billions and billions to bail out the S&amp;Ls, because that was 
a 'crisis.' Homelessness is not perceived as a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's response, Griesbach said, has been "a thousand points 
of hype." 
</P>
<P>
Although public sympathy for the homeless has been high, as indicated by polls, 
there are signs of frustration that after years of work and billions of dollars 
spent, homeless people still can be seen every day on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
Minneapolis, Tulsa, Okla., and other cities have passed ordinances regulating 
panhandling. Merchants in Atlanta, Philadelphia and other cities have 
complained. In New York, a man was charged with manslaughter in the death of a 
beggar he said attacked him and his young son. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I see a backlash in the country? Yeah," said Ken Smith, who runs a shelter 
for homeless veterans in Boston. "Why? Because I think (public is) becoming 
aggravated by the fact that they can't walk a city block without being asked 
for money."

HELL, SWEET HELL; 
</P>
<P>
REVIVED CLUB SAYS, IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT, SHUT YOUR MOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you love San Diego, Gary Beals wishes you'd keep it to yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"Complain. Kvetch. Bellyache," he advises. "When people call San Diego a Navy 
town, don't correct them. Let them think the place is fit only for 
beer-swilling, overweight chief petty officers." 
</P>
<P>
Don't misunderstand. Beals, who runs an advertising agency in Kensington, has 
no plans to leave his hometown. But, as the administrator of the newly revived 
San Diego Hell on Earth Club, he feels it is his duty to let out-of-towners 
know just how dreadful life here can be. Then maybe they won't move in. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone must stand up and protect innocent Easterners from brush fires, 
earthquakes, droughts, mud slides, drug dealers and smog," he said in a 
statement embargoed for release until today, April Fool's Day. "This area is 
completely unlivable . . . (and) is not the bowl of geraniums it might appear 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at the club's first meeting April 13, Beals will seek to inspire 
like-minded sarcastic individuals to spread the word. He cautions that 
membership is "not for the humor-impaired." But even the newest residents of 
America's Finest City can join, as long as they pay $15 and adopt the 
appropriate attitude: "We've got ours -- now raise the drawbridge." 
</P>
<P>
Those who join the ranks of the complainers will receive a laminated membership 
card and a copy of Wildfire, the club's quarterly newsletter. Named for San 
Diego's brush-fire season, the four-page flyer will include features such as 
the Loathsome Beast of the Month, which will profile the area's pests, from 
fleas to houseflies. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue warns that San Diego County is riddled with earthquake faults 
-- and provides a map showing where. It lauds San Diego's pioneers for choosing 
unattractive names for such local hot spots as Spook Canyon, Garlic Flats, 
Skunk Spring and Slaughterhouse and Hellhole canyons. It also summarizes the 
club's goals: 
</P>
<P>
"We want to throw a wrench into the cogs of the power structure here. The 
sticky mass of self-serving real estate profiteers, wishy-washy politicians and 
others who think we really need to put San Diego on the map," says Vol. I, No. 
1, which claims that the club's only weapon is ridicule. "There may be no blood 
in this fight, but there will be Bufferin and Maalox aplenty. We will be a 
plague upon anyone who seriously believes San Diego needs to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Beals borrowed the group's name from the original Hell on Earth Club, founded 
in the late 1940s by Dr. Roger Revelle, a co-founder of UC San Diego, and his 
buddy, the late Gifford Ewing, owner of La Jolla's La Valencia hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"They did it to counteract a furniture store owner who had formed a Heaven on 
Earth Club to try to bring tourists to the area," remembers Revelle's wife, 
Ellen, whose 81-year-old husband is recovering from recent heart bypass 
surgery. "Roger said, 'Enough is enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the real inspiration for the club is Lesser Seattle Inc., a spoof 
organization in Washington state whose motto is "KBO -- Keep the Bastards Out." 
Emmett Watson, a columnist for the Seattle Times, founded the group in the 
1950s in response to Greater Seattle Inc., a group of boosters who began a 
slick campaign to lure businesses and people to the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
In his newspaper column, Watson said he would prefer that Seattle stay as it 
was. Soon, he and his followers began to actively attack the notion that big is 
good. Their slogan: "Have a nice day -- somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Beals supports the anti-growth -- or "pro-shrink" -- policies of his 
counterpart to the north, but says he does not envision the San Diego group 
being "quite as militant, bitter or . . . shrill." The San Diego motto has a 
gentler tone: Visitare bonum sed hapaitare ici male est, or, roughly, "A nice 
place to visit, but you would not want to live there." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Beals is quick to point out that San Diego is in far more trouble than 
Seattle. It has half a million more people and is growing steadily. 
</P>
<P>
According to 1990 figures compiled by American Demographics magazine, the San 
Diego metropolitan area has grown nearly 30% in the past decade. (Seattle has 
grown by only 15%.) Since 1980, San Diego has climbed five places up the list 
of biggest metropolitan areas -- from 19th to 14th. (Seattle is 24th.) 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Census Bureau reported that the city of San Diego has leaped 
ahead of Detroit into the No. 6 population ranking among U.S. cities -- with 
1,070,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Dal Watkins, president of the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau, said 
that, although Beals' group at first sounded like trouble, it may prove to be 
an ally. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they're saying is it's a nice place to visit, but don't move 
here. So, frankly, they're helping us," he said, pointing out that the bureau's 
goal is to lure visitors, not new residents. "Actually, Hell on Earth is 
compatible with what we're doing, as long as it stays tongue-in-cheek." 
</P>
<P>
Beals says that is his intention. He says he has no place for "serious" people 
-- just pranksters, punsters and people who poke fun. 
</P>
<P>
"How did the guy that invented cottage cheese know when he was finished?" Beals 
asks. "He didn't, and neither do builders. Somebody has to help them with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
So far, he's heard from a T-shirt manufacturer, a real estate appraiser and a 
television announcer, all of whom want to volunteer their services to stem the 
tide. 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming events include a salute to Camp Pendleton, the buffer between San 
Diego and "the Big Orange." Beals wants to thank the Marines for "the finest 
defense work they've ever done -- protecting us from the onslaught to the 
north." 
</P>
<P>
He also wants to create an official meat-free zone that would make it illegal 
to eat meat anywhere north of Leucadia -- to alert people that, "if you're 
going to move to this Birkenstock, brown rice, print-dress community, then 
you'll have to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
Beals is also urging members to prepare for the brush-fire season by stocking 
up on marshmallows and hotdogs. He keeps a few pre-skewered wieners handy in 
his office. And he has printed up some placards to affix to "Welcome to San 
Diego County" signs. 
</P>
<P>
"This County FULL," they say. "Please try the next county to the north or go 
back to Imperial County." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to biting parody, only one topic will be off-limits: other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
"No Cleveland jokes should be tolerated in San Diego," the newsletter mandates. 
"Cleveland is a great place to live -- please: live there."

WIDTH OF A ROAD PITS SYNOD AGAINST ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At odds over the future of a Pacific Palisades park, environmentalists and a 
synod of the Presbyterian Church have locked horns in a dispute that may now be 
left for the courts to decide. 
</P>
<P>
The Synod of Southern California and Hawaii has filed a lawsuit in a bid to 
force a state agency to build a 48-foot-wide road into Temescal Gateway Park. 
Opponents say the plan would ruin the 20-acre park, which is a favorite of 
hikers. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of road in a park as small as this one is ludicrous," said Carole 
Stevens, chairwoman of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which would be 
required to build the road. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed last month in Los Angeles Superior Court, also names the 
state of California and the Los Angeles Unified School District. The school 
district acquired the property from the synod by condemnation in 1968 to build 
a school there, but later sold it to the conservancy after plans for the school 
were scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, the synod claims that it was given assurances by the school 
district that a road would be built on the property that the synod could share, 
and that the conservancy inherited the obligation to build the road as a 
condition of its purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The park, which is next to synod property at Sunset Boulevard and Temescal 
Canyon Road, is one of the most accessible links to the extensive trail system 
in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, about 750 hikers use the trail, which originates in the park, but 
twists along an easement on synod property for almost a mile before linking up 
with a trail in Topanga State Park and a network of public hiking trails 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"Preserving the integrity of the park is of utmost concern to us," said John 
Diaz, a planner with the conservancy. "Where else can you step off a street bus 
and be at a trail head?" 
</P>
<P>
The synod's opponents have accused church officials of wanting to sacrifice the 
park for the sake of a new Presbyterian Conference Center that the synod has 
long wanted to build and that would be served by the proposed road. 
</P>
<P>
The road would run for a quarter of a mile along the park boundary that abuts 
the synod property, starting at Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials declined comment on the dispute, referring inquiries to an 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"The synod has taken the action that it has in order to get the road it feels 
it is entitled to have," said Bill White, a lawyer for the synod. 
</P>
<P>
White said the synod had "gone to great lengths" to negotiate a compromise with 
the conservancy and the neighbors over the road and the size of the proposed 
conference center. He said the lawsuit was filed as an act of "self-protection" 
because of the conservancy's plans for a 28-foot-wide roadway into the park, 
which synod officials say is inadequate to help serve the size of the 
conference center they have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The synod, which represents about 300 churches, has for many years operated a 
conference center in several old buildings capable of accommodating 135 guests. 
Some of the Palisades' first permanent structures, a meat market and grocery 
store built in the 1920s, now serve as the center's office and cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
For years, church officials have talked of building a new center to accommodate 
up to 500 guests and a staff of between 10 and 15 people. But in January, in an 
apparent bid to mollify neighbors long opposed to the plan, church officials 
voted to reduce the size of the project by half. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have often criticized the synod's plan, saying it resembles a major 
hotel development more than a church retreat. Although encouraged by the 
reduced size, neighbors have made it clear they prefer there be no expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't build the kind of center they want without a wider road to satisfy 
fire-safety requirements and that sort of thing, and I think that helps to 
explain why the lawsuit was filed," said Frances Shalant, a member of the 
Pacific Palisades Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of her group and two other community groups expressed surprise at the 
timing of the lawsuit, saying that private talks between the neighbors and 
church officials had been going well. 
</P>
<P>
"It was shocking the way they did it," said Diane August, chairwoman of Friends 
of Temescal. "We would like to see them upgrade their property and keep it 
rustic and attractive without expanding, and we thought we were headed in that 
direction until (the lawsuit) occurred." 
</P>
<P>
But White, the synod attorney, said the synod is eager to make peace with its 
neighbors, despite the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"The synod is interested in protecting its rights (for a road), and has shown 
itself to be environmentally sensitive in the past," he said. "It doesn't feel 
there is anything in what it wants to do that would damage the integrity of the 
park."

DOCK HANDS SEE DECREASE IN CARGO SHIPS AS DEATH KNELL; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE STRUGGLING LONGSHOREMEN'S UNION SAYS THE PORT DISTRICT IS MORE 
INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING WATERFRONT HOTELS THAN ATTRACTING SHIPPING TO SAN 
DIEGO PIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Chavez, president of the Longshoremen's &amp; Warehousemen's International 
Union, Local 29, talks about a scenario on the San Diego waterfront that no 
longer seems improbable. 
</P>
<P>
Attrition and the disappearance of cargo ships on San Diego Bay, said Chavez, 
relating his vision of the future, have finally struck a death knell to the 
union's aging and depleted ranks. The piers, long a symbol of work for 
longshoremen, are replaced by waterfront hotels, and sailboats crisscross the 
bay where freighters, loaded with goods from all points on the compass, used to 
maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
"If we ever get any work, we can replace these (union members) who are dying 
out. But if there's no work, there's no sense in replacing them," said Chavez, 
returning to the present. "We could be a great contribution to this city if we 
could get some work." 
</P>
<P>
But the sad truth is that longshoremen's jobs are becoming extinct in San 
Diego. Local 29's membership now numbers about 75. Twenty years ago, the local, 
which was chartered in 1937, had about 220 members. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, longshoremen, who earn $19.83 an hour, worked on an average about 
three days a week on the waterfront. This year, they have been working about 1 
1/2 days a week, said Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got guys driving up to Los Angeles and Port Hueneme to work because 
there's no work here," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez and others who depend on marine cargo for their livelihood have 
predicted the end of longshoremen as they watch what they say is a steady 
decline of shipping in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody said the handwriting was on the wall. But it's frightening the way 
it's being done. It's a systematic extinction of all shipping-related work on 
the waterfront, and it's being done by the Port (District)," said Robert W. 
Young, chairman of C. L. Hutchins &amp; Co., a local shipping agent. 
</P>
<P>
Young and Chavez are among several critics who blame the San Diego Unified Port 
District for the loss of shipping. Port officials, they say, are more 
interested in turning the waterfront into a plethora of tourist hotels, 
restaurants and attractions, collecting rent at the expense of shipping. 
</P>
<P>
It is a charge that is made again and again by frustrated men and women who 
feel they are being paid lip service by port officials, who insist they are 
doing everything possible to attract shipping to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District's revenue figures, for the fiscal year ending last June 30, 
are revealing. According to spokesman Dan Wilkens, the Port District's total 
revenue was $71.4 million. Of that, $33.4 million came from leases, including 
hotels and restaurants, and $31.7 million came from operations at Lindbergh 
Field, which is administered by the port. The total take from shipping, 
including cruise ships, amounted to $6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the last six months, the status of shipping has become worse. Two ships that 
used to handle manganese and potash in San Diego have gone to ports in Long 
Beach and Los Angeles. Young and Chavez said they have stopped pressuring the 
port to bring in new cargo and are now concentrating on making sure that the 
few remaining ships that call on San Diego continue to come here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mind-boggling. While we're struggling to get new cargo, we still have to 
keep an eye on the port to make sure they don't lose the few remaining ships we 
have. It's like plugging holes in a sinking boat," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"The port would be happy to see an end to all shipping in San Diego," Chavez 
said. (Former Port Commissioner Louis) Wolfsheimer once said that people don't 
want to see freighters in San Diego Bay. They want to see sailboats." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer, who stepped down from the Board of Port Commissioners in February, 
and Bill Stonehouse, director of trade development for the Port District, 
adamantly denied that port officials are indifferent to the decline in 
shipping. But Wolfsheimer acknowledged that he envisions San Diego Bay as a 
recreational harbor "full of sailboats." 
</P>
<P>
"After being on the commission for 10 years, I can tell you that shipping finds 
its way to San Diego. There's damn little the port can do to force shipping to 
come here. The ships that are here found us. We didn't find them," Wolfsheimer 
said. "You can't force vessels to come here, even if you berth them for 
nothing. They won't come in unless they can bring cargo to San Diego and take 
cargo out." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the problem, Stonehouse said. The local economy does not produce 
any export cargo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is not an industrial town, and it doesn't produce exports. Export 
cargo means big factories to produce goods demanded overseas," Stonehouse said. 
"Plus we don't have the rail lines that Long Beach and Los Angeles have that 
are needed when you import and export cargo." 
</P>
<P>
"Cargo is not a very profitable business for this port," Wolfsheimer added. 
"But it's something we want to keep going. The port has always said that we 
might lose money on cargo but we want it. It's a loser in cash generation, but 
a winner in wages for certain groups." 
</P>
<P>
The Port District did not drive away the potash and manganese ships, Stonehouse 
said. As for charges that port officials are not attempting to attract 
shipping, Stonehouse points to what he said are "negotiations" with fruit 
importers to unload Chilean fruit in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
However, industry officials tell a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Estes, an official with the David Oppenheimer Co. in Long Beach, said his 
import company got tired of dealing with Stonehouse and other port officials, 
who he said "are incapable of making a decision." Oppenheimer is the largest 
importer of Chilean fruit on the West Coast, handling one-third of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can make a decision. And, once a decision is made, quite often it gets 
changed," Estes said. "You discuss general terms of a contract, and everybody 
agrees. Then they draw something up and you end up in negotiations again." 
</P>
<P>
Although Stonehouse said port officials are negotiating with Oppenheimer, Estes 
said, "It's not even in my thought pattern to come to San Diego at this point 
in time." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Oppenheimer imported Chilean fruit through San Diego for one 
growing season, from December to April, and the experience proved disastrous, 
said Estes. A problem arose when port officials insisted that his company use a 
port-owned cold storage facility that drove up costs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Port of Long Beach, to where Oppenheimer moved its operations, San 
Diego insisted that the company use an on-site cold storage facility, with 
longshoremen to move the fruit from the pier to the facility. Using 
longshoremen to store the fruit increased costs significantly, Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach, longshoremen only unload the fruit, which is then transported to 
off-site facilities by other workers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"If the port (in San Diego) had been able to resolve these issues, we would 
have been there in a heartbeat. Not now," Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, when Oppenheimer was attempting to negotiate a long-term 
contract with the Port District, company officials assured Stonehouse that they 
could bring in $1 million a year in longshoremen's wages alone, said Estes. 
That prediction proved to be too conservative. According to Estes, Chilean 
fruit imports are now providing $3 million a year in longshoremen's wages and 
the amount of fruit that is imported has quadrupled in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Oppenheimer gave the Port District another chance, Estes said. The 
company imported kiwi fruit here, but he said the operation "was bungled so 
badly," in part by longshoremen, that Oppenheimer officials vowed not to use 
the local facility again. 
</P>
<P>
"The discharge rates were a problem. The longshoremen were not capable of 
handling refrigerated cargo at a reasonable discharge rate," Estes said. "The 
ships don't want to go back there." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that longshoremen could not meet the rate that a local 
stevedoring company quoted Oppenheimer for the number of fruit pallets unloaded 
from the ship per hour. Normally, fruit pallets can be unloaded at the rate of 
about 50 per hour, but local longshoremen unloaded them at a rate of 15 or 20 
per hour, Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to blame the longshoremen. The longshoremen down there don't 
have the ship traffic needed to give them the experience to discharge ships 
effectively. And the port's to blame for that," Estes said. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Weglarz, vice president and director of New Jersey-based Holt Cargo Systems, 
said his company pulled out of a deal to store fruit at the Port of San Diego 
when officials attempted to raise rents by 42% in the middle of a contract. In 
addition, port officials could not guarantee him berthing and storage 
facilities, Weglarz said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got good labor response in San Diego . . . but the substantial rental 
increase left us no alternative but to pull out," Weglarz said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unpleasant experience, Weglarz said his company has remained on 
good terms with the Port District. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Unzicker, spokesman for IMC Fertilizer, said his company was recently 
forced to begin shipping potash out of the Port of Long Beach, after using San 
Diego for many years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our buyers tell us which port to run it through. Long Beach has been getting 
most of the business because of the quality of service and economics," Unzicker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone who has stopped doing business with the port has a horror 
story to tell. Peter Moore, an official with BHP-Utah Mineral International, an 
Australian company based in San Francisco, speaks highly of San Diego port 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The company exports manganese to the Far East and is in the process of moving 
its shipping operations to the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest port in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided it was economically more viable to move our operations to Los 
Angeles. But I have no complaints about the people we dealt with in San Diego. 
I have heard from others that San Diego is not pro-shipping, but they never 
treated us that way," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to explain why BHP decided it was more economic to use the Port of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, longshoremen are encouraged by the Pasha Group's plans to process 
50,000 imported cars a year at the 24th Street Pier, beginning in January. 
Pasha officials estimate that the operation should generate $1 million to $1.4 
million in revenue a year. 
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement negotiated between the Port District and Pasha officials 
has been clouded by copper contamination around the pier. The Regional Water 
Quality Control Board has ordered the port to clean up pollution caused by the 
copper concentrate, which is expected to be expensive. Pasha said its contract 
with the port is contingent upon the cleanup being completed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't sit around waiting until January for an auto ship," Chavez said. "We 
need work. Besides, knowing the way the port operates, I'm not holding my 
breath. There's no guarantee that the port will do the cleanup in a timely 
manner and keep the Pasha contract." 
</P>
<P>
Estes, the Oppenheimer company official, said he sympathizes with Chavez and 
the longshoremen. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego had 200,000 square feet of pier space available for us to unload 
fruit," he said. "People said then that San Diego was the only place to unload 
fruit on the West Coast. But there was no law that said that had to happen, 
just like there's no law that says these cars have to be unloaded at San 
Diego."

<P>
A motorist was killed early Saturday when his speeding car failed to negotiate 
a bend in Jesmond Dene Road north of Escondido and slammed broadside into an 
oak tree, a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dead at the scene of the accident was Terry L. Johnson, 38, of Escondido. 
Johnson was alone in his l983 Mercedes-Benz driving south on Jesmond Dene Road 
at a high speed when his car failed to ride out the turn, the spokeswoman said.

REFLECTIONS: THE LOTTERY WAS THE PUSH I NEEDED

Richard Law, 35, of Pacific Beach won $100,000 from the California Lottery just 
two months after he moved to the state in 1986. Before that, Law, a British 
expatriate, picked cotton on an Israeli kibbutz, sold cranes for a Saudi 
Arabian sheik, sipped tea with a king and launched a successful moving company 
in Singapore. In 1986, he parlayed his lottery winnings into his own firm, a 
bike rental company for hotel guests. Law was interviewed by Times staff writer 
G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by David McNew. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always been very lucky. I've won just about every raffle you can think 
of. I won the lottery on April 16, 1986, the day after tax day. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, it was a scratch-off, and if you had three numbers the same, you 
won. So I bought one ticket and I won $5. I went back to the shop where I 
bought the ticket and asked the guy for cash. He counted out four ones and then 
said he didn't have $5, so I said just give me five tickets. 
</P>
<P>
I left one of the tickets on the table in front of our little girl, who was 3. 
She had been scratching it and playing with it, and it was on the table for a 
half an hour before I walked past the table to find there were some zeroes on 
it. The numbers hadn't been rubbed off properly so I took the ticket and 
finished off the rubbing and it said $100,000, $100,000, $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
I spent about $300 on phone calls that night, talking to old friends in Saudi 
Arabia and Singapore and wherever I used to live, telling everyone. After 
taxes, I had a net gain of $65,000, so I decided to go self-employed from that 
moment on. I had already decided, but I hadn't decided quite how. The lottery 
was the push I needed. 
</P>
<P>
But the first thing I did was take my father and two sisters to Jerusalem. 
Though I'm not Jewish, I had lived on a kibbutz for a year when I was a young 
lad, working in the cotton fields and picking pears. 
</P>
<P>
We also hired this magnificent villa in southern Spain, and I took my father, 
my sisters, their husbands, their children and my aunts. But that was really my 
only extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
My relatives normally come out every year anyway to see me wherever I live, 
because I haven't lived in England since 1974. When I was 19, I went over to 
Israel to work on a kibbutz. Then I spent about a year in England with Xerox, 
doing my sales training and selling word processors. But I was still very 
interested in the Middle East, so I decided to go work for an Arab sheik in the 
eastern province of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
I sold cranes for about six months, got a commission and everything was 
wonderful. Then, all of a sudden, the Arab owner found out that this English 
chap was stealing money, and he dismissed every single Englishman and American 
in the company. I wanted to tell the sheik it wasn't me, so I went back and he 
embraced me because I had honestly made the effort to go back. 
</P>
<P>
I was 22 then. While I was there, I found an advertisement in the Bahrain Times 
for this English company selling shelving. Bahrain is a little island country 
off Saudi Arabia. Because it's a Muslim country, women cannot wear a bikini on 
the beach, but the king had a private beach where the expatriate wives could 
wear bikinis. 
</P>
<P>
He gave away free Pepsi and orange juice, but no alcohol, all day long to 
anybody who was on the beach. The king himself would come down in a huge 
Rolls-Royce about 3 p.m., wearing flowing robes and a gold headdress. I used to 
go down to the beach to swim. What's more bizarre than finishing work at 2 or 3 
o'clock, sitting on the beach, having a free Pepsi and saying "Hi" to the king? 
</P>
<P>
I left Bahrain to open the shelving business in Singapore and Hong Kong, 
because I couldn't go any bigger. We had done all the supermarkets. We opened 
up a small office in Singapore, and we totally died. The Japanese could make my 
product for one-third of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
I left the company and decided that I had done the Far East, and the only thing 
I really had left to do was America. But it's very difficult being here legally 
for an Englishman. So I joined an international moving company in 1981, based 
in La Jolla. They asked me to take over a sales managership in Singapore, and 
we agreed, if I did a good job, they'd move me back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
We built the company up, and they lived up to their word and promoted me back 
-- to Houston. I really liked Texas, but I fell out with the company in 
Houston, and the company has since gone bankrupt. I knew I wasn't going to live 
in Houston, so in 1986 I moved to La Jolla, where I had vacationed before. Two 
months later I won the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
I decided to start a bicycle rental company because I had built a service 
company in Singapore, and I knew I could build one up from scratch. So now we 
have contracts with nearly all the major hotels, and we run a bicycle delivery 
business with nearly 400 bikes. 
</P>
<P>
I do occasionally play the lottery. For me, winning the lottery meant that a 
man who has always wanted to be his own boss could be his own boss.

DRINKING ON TEENS' TRIP THREATENS CITY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An award-winning student exchange program between Hermosa Beach and its Mexican 
sister city is in danger of losing its city funding amid complaints of lax 
supervision that led to drinking and smoking among the 13- and 14-year-old 
students on this year's trip to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
At least one child, a 14-year-old boy, got so drunk on the February trip to 
Loreto that he passed out on the beach after sneaking away from a chaperoned 
dance, his mother said. Another student, a seventh-grader, said the teen-aged 
children of her Mexican host family treated her and two friends to cigarettes 
and a case of Corona beer, which they drank while driving around Loreto on 
their last night in town. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very concerned, both from the standpoint of a councilwoman and from the 
standpoint of parent," said City Councilwoman Kathleen Midstokke, whose 
daughter was among the 21 exchange students. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like this matter investigated, and if the problem cannot be remedied -- 
and a guarantee cannot be made to parents that their children will not be 
offered alcohol and cigarettes -- I cannot be supportive of continuing city 
funding for this program." 
</P>
<P>
The head chaperon of the annual trip, Amparito Doolittle, defended the program, 
saying she thinks the complaints are being blown out of proportion by some 
people for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
She said supervision of the students has always been adequate. Students are 
clearly told that drinking and smoking are prohibited, she said, adding that 
this year, for the first time, a 10 p.m. curfew was also imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking has occurred on past trips and "nobody ever made it a big issue," said 
Doolittle, who was among four chaperons overseeing the group. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a big deal," said Doolittle, whose sentiments were shared by several 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
At issue, Doolittle said, is a program that the Hermosa Beach Sister Cities 
Committee has sponsored since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Each spring, a group of students from Hermosa Beach spend a week with various 
host families in Loreto; in the summer, Loreto sends a delegation of students 
to live with families in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hermosa Beach does not have a high school, the city sends seventh- and 
eighth-graders from Hermosa Beach City School District to Loreto. Although the 
school district is not a sponsor of the exchange, the students are screened by 
the school superintendent and are given homework to do during their week away, 
said George Barks, president of the Hermosa Beach Sister Cities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Although the $5,000 program is funded largely through donations, the city 
subsidized the trip with a $1,000 grant this year, Barks said. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably could make it without the city's support, but the money sure 
helps," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Barks said Hermosa Beach is the only city in the state to have an exchange 
program for students so young, a feature that last year won Hermosa Beach an 
award from the U.S.-Mexico Sister Cities Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had one (Hermosa) parent call me to complain about anything," he 
said. "In fact, I've had several parents thank me for having a program in 
Hermosa that their sons and daughters get a lot out of, in terms of educational 
and cultural exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the drinking incidents did not come to light until about a week 
and a half ago, when a parent, who mistakenly believed that the trip was 
school-sponsored, telephoned the school superintendent to complain and decided 
to discuss it with the school board. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she understood there was a lack of supervision and drinking on the 
trip, so I talked to a few of the kids," Supt. Shalee Cunningham said. "What I 
found out was that a few of the kids were drinking. They didn't say what, and I 
didn't ask. It was alcohol, and that was enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
According to students, parents and Doolittle, there were at least two incidents 
involving liquor and cigarettes on the trip, which lasted from Feb. 10 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Doolittle said, occurred during a Thursday night dance, attended by 
all the children and their Loreto families and the four chaperons. At one point 
during the evening, she said, one of the students fell ill and she and another 
chaperon took him home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was gone about an hour, but when I got back, I could tell something was 
wrong because about six kids were missing," Doolittle said. "The chaperons said 
they had gone out to get some soda pop because there was nothing to eat or 
drink at the dance." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to students and parents, the six were at the beach, sharing 
a bottle of vodka a 14-year-old boy had somehow procured. Eventually, a Mexican 
host parent found the group and herded them back to the dance, except for the 
boy who had obtained the vodka, who was so drunk he had to be taken home. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother learned about the incident from her son, and although she has 
grounded the boy as punishment she did not consider what happened serious 
enough to warrant a discontinuation of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"My son told me he had about an eight-inch iced-tea glass with enough stuff in 
it to make him sick and pass out," the boy's mother said. "He said he went to 
sleep on the rocks by the beach. . . . But as I look at it, if he took a drink, 
got sick, threw up and woke up and feeling terrible, maybe he'll decide never 
to drink again." 
</P>
<P>
A second incident occurred the next evening, when the children of a host family 
took three of the American students on a farewell drive around Loreto. 
</P>
<P>
"We were driving around and they had a little six-pack of Corona, and they kept 
saying: 'Want a beer? Want a beer?' " recalled one of the students, a 
13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"So we took it, and later when we stopped at a store, they said, 'Want more 
beer?' And my friend goes, 'Yes!' So they went in, and when they came out, they 
had a big box that had, like, 20 beers, and we just said, 'Oh, my God!' " 
</P>
<P>
The student said her Mexican hosts didn't know about the beer or cigarettes she 
and her friends were offered. She said that she didn't get drunk but that she 
did have two beers, even though she had been told before the trip that drinking 
was not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was, like, peer pressure," she said. "Everyone else was doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the parents were angry about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about it, but I'm not at the upset point," said Darrell 
Greenwald, who charged that Midstokke and others may be overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard some want to end the program, but I think they're going overboard. 
It's been such a good program and has gone on for so many years. I'd hate to 
see it hurt because of an incident like this being blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to run out and call every parent whose kid smoked a cigarette 
down there, and I just can't be with them 24 hours a day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless Midstokke said she plans to bring the matter before the City 
Council. And Cunningham said she plans to brief the school board on the 
incident.

<P>
When Sen. Art Torres looks at the Los Angeles River, he dreams of turning the 
concrete-lined flood control channel into an oasis of open space, especially 
for inner-city residents craving parks. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz sees the river and envisions car-pool and truck lanes 
to relieve freeway congestion from the San Fernando Valley to San Pedro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which maintains part of the flood 
control channel, is studying a proposal to earmark approximately $250 million 
to add several feet to the height of river levees, which now are between 20 and 
25 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
These differing views of the paved channel are at the center of a tug of war, 
which last week shifted to the state Capitol. 
</P>

At a hearing of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, Torres painted a 
picture of the river as a mecca for joggers, hikers, picnickers, and horseback 
riders. "The Los Angeles River really has an opportunity to come to life 
again," the Los Angeles Democrat told the committee. "Those of us who were born 
and raised in L.A. have an affinity for it. . . . Many of us used that river as 
an escape from city life." 
</P>
<P>
For Torres, the drive to establish a river park is part of a fight to turn Los 
Angeles into a more livable city, especially in areas he represents downtown 
and on the Eastside. Instead of building a roadway down the middle of the 
channel, Torres declared: "Let us turn back the clock and have a real river 
again." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief hearing, the committee, on a 7-0 vote, approved his bill to 
earmark $200,000 for the Coastal Conservancy to prepare a master plan to 
develop the river over the next two decades into a park and recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has proposed establishing a citizens advisory 
committee to consider doing essentially the same thing. Bradley, who has not 
offered many details of how he would revitalize the river, sent a letter to 
Torres in January calling the river one of the city's "greatest land assets." 
The river, he said in the letter, creates an opportunity for open space, 
recreation and other development. 
</P>
<P>
This is only the latest vision for the river. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, a Sylmar Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee, proposed that the river from Tujunga Wash in the East San Fernando 
Valley to downtown Los Angeles be reserved for buses, vans and car-poolers. 
Another stretch of the river from downtown south to Long Beach would be for 
trucks hauling cargo from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to rail 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
At his urging, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission set aside 
$100,000 to study the roadway concept. The study, to be finished in August, 
will look at the kind of transportation that should run along the river bottom, 
ways to protect people from floods and how to provide access to the channel. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers, which paved the river, has been studying a 
proposal to raise the height of the channel, primarily between Compton and Long 
Beach, to help reduce the threat of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-mile waterway begins in the southwest San Fernando Valley, where Bell 
and Calabasas creeks come together. It flows eastward along the northern base 
of the Santa Monica Mountains, runs through the narrows at Glendale past 
downtown Los Angeles and through the industrial towns of Vernon, Bell, South 
Gate and Compton, finally flowing into San Pedro Bay in Long Beach. About 35 
miles of the waterway are paved, while there are only about five miles of 
natural riverbed in the Sepulveda Basin, near Griffith Park and near Willow 
Street in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers began paving the riverbed in the 1930s -- especially 
after a string of fatal storms in 1938. During World War II, military equipment 
was hauled along the channel to the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of using the river as a roadway resurfaced almost 35 years later. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the state Department of Transportation began studying whether to turn 
an 18-mile stretch from Willow Street in Long Beach to north of downtown Los 
Angeles into a roadway. But Robert Goodell, a state transportation planner, 
said "nothing ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later -- after the Arab oil embargo highlighted the need to cut 
automobile trips -- the state examined building a busway down the river bottom. 
Apparently no one thought the idea was worth pursuing, Goodell said. 
</P>
<P>
But Katz dusted off the suggestion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Before last Tuesday's hearing on the Torres bill, Katz sent a memo to 
legislators alerting them to his vision of the river. He asserted that his view 
of the river and Torres' are not incompatible and that he envisions 
"greenbelts" along his proposed motorway. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the river channel has been ignored, left to perform its primary 
function, flood protection for millions of people," Katz said in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the problems that confront us and the potential of the river channel, we 
ought to look at all the options, not just a parkway," asserted Katz. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Katz questioned the use of scarce water resources to maintain 
Torres' proposed parkway and expressed concern about exposing people to the 
water, some of which has been treated in sewage plants. "The idea of people 
recreating in the sewage in the Los Angeles River is ludicrous," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Torres dismissed the criticism, saying that roadways like those proposed by 
Katz "will be passe in the future as we provide for more light rail" and that 
his legislation is "a pro-river bill and a pro-environment bill." Moreover, 
Torres questioned whether motorists driving down the Los Angeles River would 
have enough time to exit the highway in the event of a flash flood. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, county and federal authorities say that in all of the talk about the 
future of the river, it is sometimes forgotten that the channel is designed to 
reduce floods. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Sweeten, a Corps of Engineer planner, said "most people don't perceive a 
flood threat," especially now because of the water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have said that the higher levees and modifications to highway 
bridges also sought by the Corps of Engineers would stop a 100-year flood that 
would inundate most of Long Beach and all or part of 15 other Southeast and 
South Bay cities. The proposal is part of a federal program designed to 
eventually contain the river within its banks even after torrential rains and 
provide flood insurance for property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Young, the corps' water resources branch chief in Los Angeles, said he does 
not believe the higher levees would affect a parkway or a highway in the 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the corps' overriding priority is to ensure that flood 
control is not undermined by any changes to the river channel. "If you go into 
the river and do anything to significantly impact the flood carrying capability 
of the river, we would clearly have a problem with that," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeten pointed out that the Corps of Engineers and the Los Angeles County 
Department of Public Works, which maintains other portions of the river, must 
give the green light to any changes in the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they have not made up their minds about the future of the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the flood control function is not impaired, then we're willing to 
be open minded," said Jean Granucci, head of public affairs with the Department 
of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
But she cautioned that with either the roadway or the park proposal "there are 
some serious technical problems that have to be overcome." She cited the 
problem of access to the river if it is allowed to return to its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Carrell, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said she, too, has an open mind 
and would like both the roadway and parkland options studied. She expressed 
personal doubts about the Katz proposal, saying "Los Angeles is clearly starved 
for parks." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that a parkway could become a way to connect rich and poor 
communities in the Los Angeles area. She described plants and trees which 
already grow in the river as bits of green in "otherwise paved-over 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposals for Los Angeles River 
</P>
<P>
Among the ideas proposed for stretches of the Los Angeles River are: 
</P>
<P>
A roadway for vans, buses and car-poolers from the west San Fernando Valley to 
downtown Los Angeles. Proposed by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A roadway from downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach for trucks. Proposed by Katz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parks, with jogging and riding trails, wildlife habitat. Proposed by Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expansion of levees for flood control. Proposed by U.S. Army Corps. of 
Engineers.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW TACTICS STUDIED; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: LOS ANGELES MAY FOLLOW OTHER AREA CITIES IN LIMITING DEVELOPER ROLES 
-- AND THE APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST -- IN ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles officials who are considering steps to stop developers from 
directing environmental reviews of their own projects would be following a path 
charted by many other communities -- a move critics say is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Many other local governments in Southern California, including Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties and the city of Santa Clarita, do not let developers 
manage the environmental review process, out of concern about conflicts of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, however, continue to let 
developers select and manage the consultants who prepare environmental impact 
reports, or EIRs, on their projects. Developers then have the opportunity to 
read and edit the reports before sending them to city planners. Once planners 
have accepted an EIR, it is issued as an official government report. 
</P>
<P>
To a wide assortment of critics -- including planning officials outside Los 
Angeles and homeowner and environmental activists -- the arrangement is a 
conflict of interest and an invitation to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a brain surgeon to realize that information is going to get 
filtered to best serve the needs of the person that's paying the bill," said 
Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this business long enough . . . to know that you can pay a 
consultant to say anything," said Jeffrey T. Harris, deputy director of 
environmental review in the Santa Barbara County Resource Management 
Department. "The process can be manipulated severely when you turn the process 
over to the fox and put him in the chicken house." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and other areas considered to have tough 
planning and environmental standards, government planners choose and manage the 
EIR consultants, leaving the developer no role but to pay the bills. As a 
further precaution, some cities even restrict communication between consultants 
and developers. 
</P>
<P>
No official statistics exist, but an informal survey by The Times of about 40 
planning departments suggest more manage EIRs this way than leave developers in 
control. 
</P>
<P>
In areas where developers choose consultants, planning officials do review EIRs 
and prescribe changes before putting their seal on the work. But planning 
departments typically are understaffed, and experts say the most sharp-eyed 
planners may be unable to spot every data gap or expunge all promotional 
language. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants "basically take the attitude that they are working for the 
developer, for the person who's paying the fee," said Frank Meneses, a senior 
planning assistant with the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning. 
Often "when the first copy comes in, it's almost like a sales brochure," agreed 
Pamela Holt, chief of environmental analysis for the regional planning 
department. "Our role is to take any inherent bias out of that." 
</P>
<P>
Some EIRs sing "paeans of praise for the project," said Franklin Eberhard, 
deputy director for project planning with the city Planning Department. Keeping 
the consultants neutral is one of the "constant battles we fight," said Albert 
Landini, supervisor of environmental review for the city department. 
</P>
<P>
These officials said, however, that adequate EIRs are produced under their 
system. 
</P>
<P>
They said they send the documents back until they're satisfied that they are 
sufficiently thorough and unbiased. 
</P>
<P>
But city planners acknowledged last week that they are thinking of taking over 
the job of choosing and managing the consultants who prepare EIRs, leaving 
developers only to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmentalists and homeowners may feel more comfortable if it's not done by 
the developers," Eberhard explained. 
</P>
<P>
Developer representatives have already served notice that the proposed change 
could meet heavy resistance. Developer lobbyist Robert Wilkinson, who heads an 
advisory committee to the planning department, predicted the plan is "going to 
be objected to by everybody in the development world." 
</P>
<P>
Under the California Environmental Quality Act, an EIR is required for any 
project that may have significant environmental effects, including impacts on 
air and water quality, wildlife, recreation, traffic and public services such 
as schools. Officials may approve an environmentally harmful project, but its 
impacts must be fully and objectively disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
EIRs must also discuss alternatives to the project, and possible ways to 
mitigate environmental harm, such as by setting aside open space, planting 
trees, restoring wetlands, or making traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The mitigations proposed in EIRs are of special importance to the developer 
because they can be very costly, even in the millions. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of bias does appear in some developer-prepared EIRs, critics say, 
despite the efforts of planning officials. 
</P>
<P>
One example is the controversial Paramount Ranch project, a 150-unit tract of 
million-dollar homes to be built on the former Renaissance Faire site in 
Agoura. The National Park Service and Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy had 
long hoped to buy the scenic, oak-studded tract as an addition to the Santa 
Monica Mountains Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
But the developers were not willing sellers and the EIR did not explore the 
alternative of using the site as park land. Environmental and homeowner groups 
have cited this and other issues in a pending lawsuit that seeks to void the 
county's approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Another example is the EIR prepared for the Porter Ranch project, a huge 
commercial and residential complex planned for the hills above Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The city public works department had argued that the developer should make 
certain bridge improvements because the project would add traffic to the area. 
The EIR, however, stated that the developer had no legal obligation to make the 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, consultants have come under subtle or not-so-subtle pressure 
to provide favorable EIRs. 
</P>
<P>
An EIR consultant who has worked mainly in northern California said that on two 
occasions developers who hired her to work on EIRs offered special inducements 
in return for favorable reports. In one case several years ago, she said, she 
was told that if she could justify all the lots the developer wanted, one of 
those lots would be hers. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant, who would not speak if identified, said that other times she 
was threatened with loss of contracts for being too thorough. She said she was 
told: "If it keeps going in this direction, you're not going to get paid and 
we'll find someone else to complete the document." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Slosson, a consulting geologist in Van Nuys who has worked on EIRs, has 
also been threatened by clients with loss of work for including data that had 
not been requested by planning officials, "but that I felt as a professional 
should be considered," Slosson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said, 'Fine, get someone else,' " Slosson said. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles EIR consultant, who would not speak if identified, said he had 
"had many disagreements with clients about content and findings . . . or even 
the use of language." Typically, he said, he put more detail in the EIR than 
required to "provide . . . a little cushion," should the developer insist on 
taking some things out. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said the pressure more often is indirect or subtle, and could tempt the 
consultant to tone down his conclusions to avoid conflicts with the client. 
"Certainly, the EIR preparer knows who butters their bread," said Jim Moose, a 
Sacramento attorney involved in land-use cases. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants "want to stay in the good graces of the developer and they want 
business in the future," said John Kirlin, a professor of public administration 
at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Others cited an informal sorting-out process, in which developers learned over 
the years which consultants to deal with and which ones to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Clay Singer, a Santa Monica-based archaeological consultant who works on EIRs, 
is considered more rigorous than some in assessing archaeogical resources at 
development sites. As a result, Singer said, he does much of his work outside 
the Los Angeles area, because in Los Angeles developers have no incentive to 
hire him. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Singer said, he is retained by those who "are ignorant of my 
reputation or . . . who actually want a good job done." 
</P>
<P>
Some planning officials and developers say the risk of abuse is overrated, 
since a botched EIR can bring litigation and tie up a project for years. 
</P>
<P>
It's the developer, more than anyone else, who needs "a bullet-proof impact 
report," argued Bob Nastase, a developer and former city planner in Upland. 
</P>
<P>
Others said consultants won't compromise their ethics, if only for selfish 
reasons. A consultant need only "misrepresent or leave out some important facts 
. . . and then that guy is dead meat, he's all done, he can go get a job 
selling shoes somewhere," said Ira Norris, president of Inco Homes, a Southland 
home builder. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers said they prefered hiring consultants themselves to save time 
and red tape, not to assure a favorable EIR. They said it can take months for 
planning agencies to solicit bids and contract with an EIR preparer -- 
something they can do quickly by themselves. Some planning officials said they 
prefer to leave the developer in charge, since that spares them the burden of 
administering contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of that process point out that developers are major contributors to 
the political campaigns of county supervisors and city council members, who 
often end up deciding the fate of controversial projects. They say developers 
extend their influence by managing the EIR consultants, some of whom are 
politically connected themselves. 
</P>
<P>
One example is Engineering Technology Inc. of Sherman Oaks, which not only 
wrote the EIR on Porter Ranch, but represented the Paramount Ranch developers 
in hearings before the county supervisors. Engineering Technology is a planning 
consultancy, but also an "expediter," or lobbying firm, that doles out more 
campaign money than many of its developer clients. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles isn't the first place where developers have been reluctant to 
surrender their control of EIR consultants. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, for example, former Orange County planning director Robert G. Fisher 
suggested that the county take over the hiring of consultants. The idea was 
dropped when it provoked a strongly negative reaction from an advisory 
committee of developers and consultants, according to Fisher, now the county's 
director of harbors, beaches and parks. 
</P>
<P>
A former environmental consultant himself, Fisher said he knew from personal 
experience that consultants can be pressured by their developer-clients. "I'm 
not suggesting that it's typical, but the problem is that there's that 
temptation and it's difficult to know . . . if the public agency isn't managing 
the contract," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
"Credibility is a very important issue in government," Fisher said, "Our system 
should be designed to promote that." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, developers would shed some political baggage if they gave up 
control of the EIR consultants. Their opponents would no longer be able to say 
an EIR can't be accurate or fair simply because the developer had a hand in it. 
</P>
<P>

DELAY SOUGHT IN ENFORCEMENT OF AIRPORT GROWTH LAW IN COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: CITIES' PLANS FOR CONTROLLING BUILDING AROUND AIRPORTS ARE DUE 
JUNE 30, 1991. A STATE SENATOR WANTS A SIX-MONTH MORATORIUM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Robert G. Beverly is pressing for passage of a bill to temporarily exempt 
cities in Los Angeles County from a potentially far-reaching new law to ensure 
orderly growth around airports. 
</P>
<P>
With the support of the League of California Cities, Beverly is seeking a 
six-month moratorium on enforcement of the law that put teeth into statutes 
aimed at ensuring that hotels, office buildings, industrial parks and other 
projects are compatible with airports. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, a Republican from Manhattan Beach, described his bill as a stopgap 
measure until he can help hammer out a permanent solution. Airports in Los 
Angeles, Torrance, Long Beach, El Monte, Santa Monica, Compton, Hawthorne, La 
Verne, Burbank and Palmdale are among those affected. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the application of a law, written last year by Sen. Marion Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), designed to protect pilots from undue hazards around 
airports and protect people who live and work around airports from noise and 
safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson sought the law because airport land-use plans required by the state 
since 1970 had been completed for only about half the state's 269 airports. Los 
Angeles County had not prepared a plan for any of its 16 airports. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Beverly last week, Bergeson said: "I firmly believe that the 
Legislature should not give Los Angeles County officials the ability to delay 
even longer." 
</P>
<P>
Under her law, which took effect Jan. 1, the plans are required to be completed 
by June 30, 1991. It also requires that if an airport does not have a plan, 
many building projects, some as far as two miles from airports, will need 
approval from county airport land-use commissions as well as local governments. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly's proposal would delay the effective date in Los Angeles County until 
Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has designated the Regional Planning Commission as the airport 
planning agency in Los Angeles County. But some landowners and cities want to 
avoid having the county conduct a project-by-project review. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to retain local control of our planning cases," said Torrance Mayor 
Katy Geissert, who has been lobbying for changes in the Bergeson legislation. 
"The Regional Planning Commission is not set up or funded for this. . . . This 
is sacred turf as far as local governments are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
John Huttinger, a commission planner, said that since the Bergeson law took 
effect, only San Dimas and Torrance have filed permits for airport-related 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
More important, he said, 10 cities have maintained that the law does not apply 
to Los Angeles County. Huttinger said these cities are Long Beach, El Segundo, 
Palos Verdes Estates, South El Monte, Arcadia, Rolling Hills Estates, Lomita, 
San Fernando, Lancaster and Palmdale. He said the other 25 or so 29 cities near 
airports, including Los Angeles, have not contacted his office. 
</P>
<P>
It is going to take a lot of personnel "to process all local land use decisions 
through the county . . . and there has been no additional money provided by the 
state," Lomita City Atty. Robert Wadden said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that his reading of the "is that it specifically exempted counties 
of more than 4 million population. That's Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne City Manager Kenneth Jue agreed, characterizing the original bill as 
a "poor piece of legislation that sneaked through. So many of the cities did 
not think Los Angeles County was included in this." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the county has acknowledged that it must review planning cases within 
two miles of an airport, city planners say they have been waiting for further 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen no guidance from them on how to submit these materials," Rodney 
Kahn, Hawthorne assistant planner, said. "It kind of leaves us in an awkward 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly inserted his proposal into a bill that was already in the Assembly. 
Action by the Assembly on Beverly's bill could come as early as Monday.

In an election with few major issues, three candidates for the Gardena City 
Council have turned to a time-honored political debate: the merits of 
incumbency versus the need for fresh ideas in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Both four-term incumbent Mas Fukai and two-term incumbent Gwen Duffy have run 
well-financed and leisurely campaigns focusing on their accessibility and 
ability to work with other members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The lone challenger, Steve Bradford, who is black, praised the council 
generally, but criticized it for not adequately representing the city's growing 
black and Latino population. The current council has three whites and two 
Japanese-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old has focused his campaign on the "new ideas and new blood" he 
would bring to the office. To bring about black and Latino representation, he 
is advocating electing council members by district rather than the current 
at-large elections, in which the minority vote is generally diluted. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donald L. Dear is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
At a forum Thursday night sponsored by the League of Women Voters and the 
Gardena Chamber of Commerce, glaring stage and cable television lights 
generated more heat on stage than that achieved from discussion among the 
candidates for the four-year seats. 
</P>
<P>
The session typified the campaigns. Fielding questions from about 70 people in 
the audience on subjects such as crime, development and water conservation, 
candidates did little to distinguish their platforms from the others. 
</P>
<P>
All indicated a key issue in the future would be the pressure to replace the 
predominant single-family housing stock in the city with multi-unit 
developments. Bradford used the forum to press his anti-incumbent campaign 
theme. 
</P>
<P>
"This was once a place of security," he told the audience. "Unfortunately, 
times have changed. When law-abiding citizens are captive in their own homes, 
something is awfully wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Countering Bradford's argument, both Duffy and Fukai reeled off lists of their 
accomplishments, including an innovative "graffiti hot line" at City Hall and 
an expansion of the Gardena Police Department to provide two officers for every 
1,000 residents of the city. 
</P>
<P>
All of the candidates emphasized their deep Gardena roots. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford has lived in Gardena for 21 years, and recently resigned from his job 
as a marketing representative for IBM "to concentrate on the campaign." A 
graduate of Gardena High School, Bradford received a degree in political 
science from Cal State Dominguez Hills. He currently serves on the local water 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, 67, who is white, became in 1982 the first woman elected to the Gardena 
council. She has lived in the city 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fukai's family has lived in Gardena for four generations, and were interned 
along with other Japanese-Americans during World War II. The 63-year-old 
council member is also chief deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn. He was first elected to the Gardena council in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Both incumbents have called on voters to stay the course. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any issues in this campaign," Fukai said in an interview last 
week. "We are one of the most stable and financially secure cities in the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
Fukai said the city cannot allow multi-unit housing to make up more than half 
the housing in the city, a ratio that is not too far away. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we are going to have to deal with that when we revise the General Plan. 
I think we will probably make some zoning changes that are going to make some 
property owners mad," Fukai said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy in an interview last week identified crime, multi-unit construction, and 
commercial development as Gardena's primary issues but said, "This community is 
better than ever. I think the people will see that and stay the course." 
</P>
<P>
Bradford said he is the only candidate who can truly represent the city's 
younger residents, as well as the black and Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a real tragedy that most of our problems with gangs and crime are in the 
black and Hispanic areas," Bradford said in an interview. "That's 50% of our 
people who don't seem to have a voice in city government." 
</P>
<P>
Although known as a bastion of the Japanese-American community in the South 
Bay, black and Latino populations in Gardena have surged in recent years. They 
now make up about 45% of the population, with 23% black, 22% Latino, 21% 
Japanese-American, 26% Anglo and 8% other nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
The city has never elected a black or Latino council member, although City 
Treasurer Lorenzo Ybarra was elected in 1988 over a Japanese-American and an 
Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he wins or not, Bradford said he will press his campaign to elect 
council members by district, rather than citywide, as the only way to ensure 
that black and Latino candidates have an increased chance to win council seats. 
</P>
<P>
Although most large cities, such as Los Angeles, elect city council members 
from geographically distinct districts, most small cities, including Gardena, 
elect at-large members to represent the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
Under district elections, citizens vote only for candidates from the districts 
where they live, which gives minority neighborhoods a better chance to elect 
their own representatives. Proponents of district elections argue that votes of 
minority groups are diluted when spread out over an entire city. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Duffy nor Fukai support district elections for Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in a small city, we need the overview of at-large representation," 
Duffy said. "There have been opportunities at each election for strong 
candidates from any ethnic group. People just end up choosing the candidate 
they think is best."

2 SAN PEDRO STUDENTS WIN CITIZEN BEE COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Pedro high schools students won first place Saturday in the South Bay 
regional finals of a nationwide civic competition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ivo M. Labar, a senior at San Pedro High School, and James K. Fujita, a junior 
at Marystar of the Sea High School, were among nearly 300 students to compete 
in regional competitions Saturday throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizen Bee competition, in its second year in California, is sponsored by 
the Los Angeles Times and the Close Up Foundation, a Washington-based 
organization devoted to civic education. The question-and-answer session tests 
students' knowledge of American government and history, geography, economics, 
culture and current events. 
</P>
<P>
Labar and Fujita each won $500 and a change to participate in the state finals 
to be held April 28 at the University of Southern California. Winners of the 
state competition will receive a three-day expense-paid trip to the national 
finals in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Second-place finishers in the South Bay were Brian Y. Yamasaki of Gardena High 
School and Abigail Derecho of Narbonne High School. Marisa Aliber of Inglewood 
High School and Chikako Imoto of South High School in Torrance won third-place 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
Students participating in Saturday's competition came from high schools in 
Wilmington, Rolling Hills Estates, Gardena, Hawthorne, Inglewood, San Pedro, 
Manhattan Beach, Harbor City, Redondo Beach, Torrance and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
One of California's state champions last year, Ken Kuniyuki of Torrance, placed 
third in the national championship.

PENDLETON'S BLANKETS STILL GOOD AS GOLD AMONG AMERICAN INDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARILYNN WHEELER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly a century, Pendleton Indian blankets are woven into the culture of 
every American tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Prized for their vibrant colors and distinctive patterns, these woolens are 
traditionally presented at tribal christenings, form the core of a young girl's 
dowry and are used as burial shrouds. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton Woolen Mills is the only domestic manufacturer that still caters to 
the Indian trade. In a sense, it's a license to print money: The blankets are 
used to negotiate tribal business deals and are readily accepted as loan 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
"Pendleton blankets have always been collectible because the Indians understood 
them as a form of currency they trusted and understood," says Jim Collins of 
Aspen, Colo., a private dealer and Indian textile expert. 
</P>
<P>
Collins says prices among antique dealers and collectors have tripled in the 
last five years. The best vintage blankets, which originally sold for under 
$10, now fetch $800 to $1,000 wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
When the first colonists arrived on the Eastern Seaboard, they found blankets 
an essential of Indian life, serving both as shelter and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, blankets were a medium of exchange. Quaker leader William Penn used 
blankets in bartering with the Delaware Indians for the real estate now known 
as Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians stopped making their own blankets around 1875. Collins has his own 
theory as to why. 
</P>
<P>
The Navajos were acknowledged as the best blanket weavers in North America. 
They were also fierce fighters against the U.S. Cavalry's efforts to conquer 
the Southwest frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated battles failed to subdue them, so in 1863 an Army unit led by Kit 
Carson burned and pillaged the Navajos' land. The impoverished tribe 
surrendered, and survivors spent five years in an internment camp. 
</P>
<P>
When they were released they were issued blankets like they had never seen: 
machine-woven, olive-drab Army blankets. 
</P>
<P>
It was more than a decade before the tribe got back on its feet. By then, 
according to Collins' theory, they had lost their blanket customers to 
commercial manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1893, two Boston wool brokers built a mill at Pendleton in northeastern 
Oregon. They were trying to cut rail costs by cleaning wool before it was 
shipped from western sheep country to eastern mills. 
</P>
<P>
Since lanolin and dirt account for more than 60% of the weight of newly sheared 
fleece, they stood to save plenty. But tariffs for clean wool skyrocketed 
shortly after the mill opened, so in 1895 they turned it into a blanket-weaving 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1909, the mill was sold to the C. P. Bishop family of Salem, whose 
descendants remain its sole owners. The family hired Englishman Joe Rounsley as 
head textile designer. His fascination with tribal art inspired the Pendleton 
Indian blankets of today. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived in the West, Rounsley was quick to establish a rapport with the 
Indians. He immersed himself in their culture, living at various times with the 
Navajos, Hopis and Apaches. 
</P>
<P>
His blankets never copied an Indian pattern, but they adapted tribal symbols. 
They also appealed to the Indians' love of color. Rounsley also was sensitive 
to Indian spiritual traditions. His patterns extended beyond the selvage edges, 
for example, because Indians believed a design contained within a blanket's 
borders would trap its owner's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Tribes grew to treasure Pendleton blankets, tourists took them home as 
souvenirs of the West, and before long the blankets' appeal had spread to the 
general public. 
</P>
<P>
The current product line includes 15 patterns and 200 color combinations, most 
of which retail for $125 to $135. They are marketed to the tribes through a 
distributor in Arizona, who sells to Indian trading posts and retailers in 
tribal areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Nance, manager of Pendleton's blanket and piece goods division, confers 
with the tribes in developing new patterns. Last spring he traveled to South 
Dakota to develop a new blanket requested by the Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton is proud of its roots in the Indian trade, but the attachment is more 
than sentimental. Although he declined to discuss profits, Nance said, "It's 
not just a hobby."

AIRPORT A NOISY NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your story of March 27, perhaps the reason Burbank Airport is losing 
money is because it is no longer a good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Since last August, when the airport changed its flight pattern, residents of 
Studio City, Sherman Oaks and Encino have been harassed by its flights. 
</P>
<P>
I can see the planes from my back window. Do you know how low and loud a plane 
is when you can see it? Do you know how much air pollution and noise pollution 
comes from a plane that low? Do you know what it's like to have your 
conversations, TV viewing and peace of mind disturbed by the noise? Do you know 
what it's like not to be able to sleep in past 7 a.m. seven days a week because 
the planes are buzzing your house? 
</P>
<P>
What happens to property values when we try to sell our homes? Would you buy a 
house in the flight pattern of an airport? Developers, think what you could do 
with all that land Burbank Airport is on! 
</P>
<P>
We have wonderful airports in Palmdale and LAX. We have minivans that will pick 
you up at your door, drive you directly to these airports without a bit of 
fuss. 
</P>
<P>
We all live in a valley where the noise resounds. There is enough pollution and 
noise on the ground. If we do not want this to continue or increase, now is the 
time to do something!

EX-LAWNDALE EMPLOYEE SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Lawndale maintenance supervisor accused of charging the city for 
building supplies that were used in private remodeling projects was sentenced 
Friday to three years probation and required to pay $4,500 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Originally charged with two counts of embezzlement and two counts of grand 
theft, Floyd (Bud) Marez, 49, agreed this month to plead no contest to one 
count of grand theft, which was later reduced to a misdemeanor, in exchange for 
having the other three charges dropped, Deputy Dist. Atty. Herb Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
Marez was also sentenced to two days in jail, which he had already served. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was probably a pervasive attitude in the city at the time that it's 
OK to do other work while you're being paid by your agency," Lapin said. "It 
was somewhat accepted, as long as it wasn't out of control." 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing brought to a close a scandal that at one time implicated five 
other city employees and cost the city several thousands of dollars in losses 
as well as in investigative and disciplinary costs, Lawndale City Atty. David 
J. Aleshire said. 
</P>
<P>
Marez, who began working for the city in 1981, was suspended and later fired 
from his job as maintenance supervisor in August, 1988, after a city 
investigation accused him of using city-paid materials on city time to 
undertake remodeling projects for private gain. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office later charged Marez with embezzling $4,700 in 
city funds and charging at least $400 in wire mesh and other materials to the 
city in order to remodel the home of Yolanda Candelaria of Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Candelaria told The Times that she had hired Marez and a co-worker, Thomas 
Gomez, then 26, to remodel her home for $30,000 in the spring of 1988. After 
she paid a deposit of $20,000, Marez and Gomez failed to complete the work and 
left her home a shambles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, who also was suspended, resigned during the investigation. Two other 
employees, whose names were never disclosed, were also disciplined for taking 
part in the alleged theft. 
</P>
<P>
Marez could not be reached and his attorney, Deputy Public Defender Ken Erlich, 
declined to comment.

8 YOUTHS ARRESTED IN HERMOSA BEACH FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight young men and women were arrested on the Strand in Hermosa Beach early 
Friday morning during a fight that left two others injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbance began about 2:15 a.m. when one of the victims was beaten by a 
group of young people, who police said were suspected gang members. 
</P>
<P>
A second man was stabbed in the face when he came to the aid of the first 
victim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who fled after the fight, were arrested by Manhattan Beach police 
as they drove away on Sepulveda Boulevard. Manhattan Beach police said these 
suspects began fighting with officers when they were detained. One of the 
suspects was bitten by a police dog during the struggle.

PUBLIC HEARING SET ON VIA VALMONTE CLOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A public hearing will be held Wednesday at Torrance City Hall to determine the 
environmental impacts of closing Via Valmonte in Torrance at the boundary of 
Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
The street on the city's southern boundary is a major access road leading into 
and out of the peninsula city. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance council members instructed city planners to do the environmental study 
following complaints by residents over growing congestion along the road. The 
council's move has enraged many Palos Verdes Estates residents, who say they 
would face a major inconvenience if the street is closed.

The specter of another increase in the price of a postage stamp has again 
raised calls for privatizing the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the campaign for privatization is James C. Miller, former head of the 
federal Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan Administration. Miller 
argues that if private companies were allowed to deliver the mail -- currently, 
they may only deliver parcels, extremely urgent mail and some bulk mail -- 
prices would fall and the mail would travel more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Furiously defending the Postal Service as a government agency is Postmaster 
General Anthony M. Frank, who frequently has found himself debating Miller on 
the subject. Frank says the agency's proposal to increase the price of a 
first-class stamp to 30 cents next year barely allows the agency to keep up 
with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 For a debate on the issues, journalist Sharon Bernstein conducted separate 
interviews of Frank and Miller, asking them the same questions and allowing 
each to respond to the other's views. 
</P>
<P>
Does the Postal Service need to be changed? If so, how? 
</P>
<P>
Miller: The Postal Service needs to be changed in two specific dimensions. The 
more important is to repeal the private-express statutes that presently grant 
the Postal Service a monopoly on the delivery of addressed mail. The second 
reform that needs to be made is to transfer the Postal Service from the public 
sector to the private sector and give it the types of incentives competitive 
firms have. 
</P>
<P>
Frank: Jim Miller makes his living off of doing this. It was an avocation for 
him (when he was with the Reagan Administration), and now it's become a 
vocation. His ideas -- if you can call them ideas -- are not worth dignifying 
with a discussion. 
</P>
<P>
(As far as changes,) nothing stays the same in our country. In point of fact, 
the Postal Service is going to go through more changes in the next five years 
than it has in the history of the country. So of course it's changing. We're 
automating more of our systems, and we're going to pay discounts to the big 
bulk mailers for presorting their mail and putting their own bar codes on. That 
will free our people up to do more customer service. 
</P>
<P>
But its system of ownership will not change. 
</P>
<P>
What is the basic argument in favor of privatizing the Postal Service? 
</P>
<P>
Miller: There really are two different issues: postal privatization and removal 
of the monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
First, I'd like to talk about the monopoly. Our commercial system is based on 
competition. Indeed, some believe the antitrust laws are the Magna Carta of our 
marketplace. Yet the antitrust laws do not apply to the Postal Service. If they 
did, you would get a more responsive, lower-priced operation. 
</P>
<P>
As for privatization, government firms are notoriously inefficient because they 
have no bottom line. All over the world, countries are privatizing their 
government corporations, whether it's in the industrialized West or in the 
Eastern Bloc. Yet we in America steadfastly cling to a dinosaur Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
Frank: First of all, there's not two issues, there's one. Jim Miller wants to 
break up the Postal Service into little pieces and sell off the profitable 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service has two functions. One is to run as a business and one is to 
run as a public service. You'd probably end up with a thousand private 
carriers; some would go bankrupt in competing for what would be the higher 
concentrations of population -- major cities -- where deliveries are less 
expensive. The Post Office would be left with the most difficult and costly 
deliveries, the ones private firms don't want. They'd want Manhattan but not 
the Bronx and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
How is the Postal Service currently financed? 
</P>
<P>
Frank: Most people don't know this, but the Postal Service does not take a dime 
in taxes. We are completely self-contained. And since the Post Office was 
changed to the Postal Service in 1971, the price of postage has kept pace with 
inflation and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
If the Postal Service is sold to a private company, wouldn't consumers be at 
the mercy of a profit-oriented company that, like an unregulated phone company, 
could raise rates at will? 
</P>
<P>
Miller: I don't think it would be like the telephone company. I would not 
propose giving any postal company a monopoly on the delivery of mail. I would 
much rather risk my welfare on competitive firms pursuing the profit motive. 
</P>
<P>
Frank: And prices will go down just like airline travel went down so much since 
deregulation. Now you get to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $400 
bucks when it used to cost you $12.50. I hope the sarcasm is coming across 
here. 
</P>
<P>
People who have been in the private mail business for a long time talk of 
literally hiring carriers off the street. What kind of quality control would be 
used if the Postal Service went private? 
</P>
<P>
Frank: Yes, the old wino mail drop. The Postal Service employs 750,000 people, 
and most of them are career employees. 
</P>
<P>
Miller: People entrust many times the number of parcels to United Parcel 
Service as they do to the Postal Service every day. The Postal Service is 
practically out of the parcel business because they just can't stand the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
And at the high end, people trust their express mail service to private 
companies far more than to the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
How would the jobs and work environment of postal employees be affected by 
privatization? 
</P>
<P>
Frank: When Jim Miller talks about privatization, he means union busting. The 
Postal Service pays its people $15 an hour, plus another $5 in benefits. Miller 
would pay them entry level wages of $4 to $6. 
</P>
<P>
Miller: I don't think they would be adversely affected significantly, although 
postal union leadership is adamantly opposed to it. The competitive postal 
services pay their employees very well, but they work under more flexible work 
rules that allow their employees to be more productive. 
</P>
<P>
(The Postal Service says its) work rules protect the workers. Well, you can 
have an operation that protects its workers to the point that they don't 
service the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Do any other countries have a private postal system? 
</P>
<P>
Miller: New Zealand took its postal service private three years ago, and it's 
working very well. The government maintains some ownership, but it's 
essentially private. 
</P>
<P>
Frank: That country is about 600 miles long with 3 million people. As soon as 
they went private they closed 70% of their post offices. The cost of a letter 
went up an immediate 33% for three-day delivery and twice that for next-day 
service. 
</P>
<P>
How likely is the United States to take its postal system private? 
</P>
<P>
Miller: It's more likely they'll reduce the monopoly power of the Postal 
Service sooner than they will take it private. And I don't think either is 
likely any time soon. The reason is the postal unions and the Postal Service 
itself is very popular on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the power of the idea is not something to overlook; it's a 
very strong one. And don't be surprised if 10 years from now it's accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
Frank: If we do our job, the chances of that happening are nil. 
</P>
<P>
(Miller) says, "Let's just try it as an experiment." Well, if it doesn't work, 
how do you put Humpty Dumpty back together again? Do you just go out and say, 
"I want to hire 750,000 people and train them?"

<TEXT>
<P>
Garbled adages and mixed metaphors are always fun, like in "A stitch in time 
saves a pound of cure." 
</P>
<P>
They sound like they should make sense, but they really don't. Gracie Allen 
used to be pretty good at it. 
</P>
<P>
In "Perrier Crisis No Watershed for Evian," Feb. 27, an Evian spokesperson 
says, "We know the shoe could always fall on the other foot." 
</P>
<P>
Gracie would have liked that one.

COVERAGE OF PERRIER'S PROBLEM WAS OVERBLOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerald C. Meyers' "Perrier's Crisis Mismanagement," Feb. 25, unwittingly 
provided a source of high hilarity that was much needed in the Southern 
California French colony. 
</P>
<P>
His article is laughable because it covers -- with the help of an enormous 
drawing -- an unwarranted space in the Business section. 
</P>
<P>
Why so much fuss when much more important news, such as the production of 
lethal gases by Libya, gained much less publicity? 
</P>
<P>
Could it be envy at Perrier's excellent promotion in the United States, only 
second to the arrival of le Beaujolais Nouveau? Or the fact that Perrier 
controls so many American bottled water companies? Without the discovery of 
infinitesimal traces of benzene, who would have known about Perrier's vast 
control of the bottled water business? 
</P>
<P>
Most European articles on l'Affaire Perrier agree that Perrier management did 
an excellent job of human relations. Some even said the $35-million recall 
would prove to be a good publicity investment and that the company will come 
out of it smelling like une rose, perhaps what the illustration meant.

ALICE KAHN: LOOK OUT BELOW: SHE'S PERCHED ON A SHAKY PLATEAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Help! I'm stuck here on this plateau. One false move and I fall onto the 
demographic bulge below. 
</P>
<P>
They want my house. They want my job. They want my husband. They only want one 
of my 2.3 children. 
</P>
<P>
This is hard. I was trained as a climber. I am part of those last achievers, 
the older baby boomers. (Technically, the war was still going on when I was 
born. But while I was eating my Pablum, someone dropped the Big One, and when I 
turned around there were several million babies fighting for my toys.) 
</P>
<P>
All my life I've had to stay alert or be trounced. Back in the '70s, when I 
started jogging, I thought I was pretty unusual. Then I went to my first (and 
last) race, the San Francisco Bay to Breakers. Nothing like standing at the 
starting line with 50,000 other runners to kill your sense of your own 
uniqueness. 
</P>
<P>
I remember hearing the guy behind me say to his friend, "As soon as we get to 
the hill, we'll lose these turkeys in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
Every time I thought I was on to something different, it became a major fad 
within a year. Two months ago, I announced I liked rap music. Next thing I 
knew, it was on the cover of Newsweek. I am now exactly two months ahead of my 
time. But who's counting? 
</P>
<P>
So I worry: What happens if I start falling behind, if I lose my grip and fall 
off the plateau? Will I lose what I've worked so hard all my life to achieve? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly all my life. If you are part of my generation, you know we 
didn't really get started until we were in our 30s. We enjoyed an extended 
childhood and the reprieve the late '60s gave us. We spent our 20s "into" every 
form of hedonism and self-indulgence known to mankind, including the social 
revolutionary fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
But then we hit our 30s off and running. Overnight, we became workaholics and 
entrepreneurs and parents. You know what I'm talking about if -- in the last 10 
years -- you have acquired five or more of the following: a VCR, a computer, a 
phone machine, a compact disc player, a microwave, a camcorder, an unused car 
and a home mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
We certainly don't need any more stuff; in fact, we probably didn't need all 
this stuff. But now the struggle is not to lose what we've got. 
</P>
<P>
I get scared. I get scared, in this 15-minutes-of-fame, what's-hot/what's-not 
world, that I'll be discarded. I panicked when I read a description of a young 
actress: "She's as hot as early Meryl Streep." What does that make me? As unhot 
as mid-life Alice Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Research Institute futurist Tom Mandel has said: "The '90s will be the 
decade of the mid-life crisis." I wonder if I'll survive it without the escape 
routes of my youth. 
</P>
<P>
The sexual fantasyland is becoming more like Disneyland. The other night, as I 
was drooling over Charlie Sheen, my daughter had the bad manners to remind me, 
"Mom, puh-leeze, he's young enough to be your son." 
</P>
<P>
At parties, while talking to a cute guy, I do some complicated math in my head. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise fantasyland no longer works either. I used to think I could count 
on jogging for a perpetual sense of upward mobility. But I now struggle to do 
in a week what I once could do in a day's run. 
</P>
<P>
So I'm on this plateau hanging on for dear life. I look below and get dizzy. I 
look up and see that craggy peak. And sometimes I want to turn to the gang 
that's plateauing with me and say: "Hey, you guys, why don't we just stop right 
here and have some fun?"

THE PRACTICE OF 'OUTING' DRAWS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the gay and lesbian lifestyles differ greatly from my own, I base my 
acceptance of them on the belief that what goes on between consenting adults is 
their business and not mine. 
</P>
<P>
Now a self-righteous few insist that one's choice of sexual partners is, in 
fact, everyone's business. This same group suggests that anyone whose personal 
conduct or politics do not pass their inspection is a proper target for public 
humiliation, loss of job security and disrupted personal relationships through 
exposure of their sexual preferences. This is progress for the gay community? 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like sexual McCarthyism to me.

ZAN THOMPSON: GOOD EXCUSE FILLED WITH HOT AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I may well have stumbled upon the perfect excuse for tardiness. If punctuality 
is the courtesy of kings, even a king couldn't have made up this reason for 
being late to a dinner engagement. None of those cool-looking women with the 
cast-iron hair-do's who write etiquette columns have ever heard this one. 
</P>
<P>
The entire episode could only have happened in a place like the Coachella 
Valley, so it really isn't an all-purpose excuse. This valley has more balloons 
than a 5-year-old's birthday party. They are giant hot-air balloons covered 
from top to bottom in crayon-colored stripes. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, I had a dinner engagement with Clifford, Judith and Courtney 
Miller and was due at their house at 6 o'clock. Time with the Millers is a 
delight and I didn't want to be late. 
</P>
<P>
When I went out to get in the car about 20 minutes before the hour, I heard a 
great huffing and puffing and looked up. There almost directly above me was a 
great balloon, red and yellow and purple and green. Wanting to be an amiable 
new desert resident, I waved at the basketful of people. One of the men said in 
a normally pitched voice, "There's a lady waving at us. Maybe she'd like to 
have us come to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
By then, the street was full of people, looking up at the ice cream cone-shaped 
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
The first man in the gondola yelled, "What are we having for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't think of anything wonderfully gourmet so I said, "Pot roast, carrots 
and potatoes and onions and brown gravy." 
</P>
<P>
Then the second man said, "Wonderful. We'll be right there." 
</P>
<P>
There were two women in the balloon who seemed to be the passengers. The men 
turned on the gas, which roared and glowed a devil's orange inside the balloon. 
All the time, they were sinking slowly toward the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Very soon, they settled to the earth and began clambering out of the balloon. 
Then a four-door pickup truck and a van came swooping down the street with the 
name of the balloon company on the side. They have chase cars that follow the 
balloons and pick up the passengers and the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
By now, the balloon was slowly folding itself inward. The pilot and passengers 
got into the van and drove off, but not before the first man called, "We'll be 
back for the pot roast." 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen hot-air balloon ride companies listed in the telephone 
book here. They specialize in champagne flights and venturesome names like 
Cloud Busters, Dream Flight Balloons, Fantasy Balloon Flights, Sunrise 
Balloons, Ballooning With Moon Shadows and Desert Air Charters. 
</P>
<P>
The balloon that almost came to dinner is part of a fleet of five belonging to 
Desert Balloon Charters. The owner is John Zimmer who came to the desert in 
1980 with a small balloon and $300. He had been ballooning as a hobby since 
1977 in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer says it is not because of the heat that balloons fill the sky here. He 
closes down his service from the end of May until the end of October. What 
makes the Coachella Valley attractive to the men in the wonderful balloons is 
the flat terrain and the beauty of the mountains bordering the Valley. And, 
what they really like best for their sport, are the cool light breezes. 
</P>
<P>
John has four pilots and he pilots himself. There's a crew that helps inflate 
the balloons and help them aloft. Then they follow in the four-door and pickup 
truck or one of two large vans. 
</P>
<P>
The three-sided basket is called a gondola. The fuel is propane; there are 
tanks in all three corners of the triangle. There's a small pilot light inside 
the balloon and the fliers add propane by turning valves on the tanks and in 
the balloon (envelopes is what the professionals call these big things). 
</P>
<P>
The ride costs $125 for each person and there is a glamorous champagne toast at 
the end of the flight. Each passenger receives a certificate that commemorates 
his casting off the surly bonds of earth. 
</P>
<P>
One woman said, "I really know how a sea bird feels when he spreads his wings 
and glides along. It's so quiet and so free." 
</P>
<P>
John told me the champagne toast started in France where the French love the 
style and grace of ballooning. When Frenchmen landed in a farmer's field they 
immediately offered him a glass of champagne to soothe his possible ill temper. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Barbara Coulson had a balloon ride with John Zimmer in a desert 
charter balloon when she was given a ride for her birthday. The certificate 
reads, "The wind has welcomed you with softness. The sun has blessed you with 
warm hands. You have flown so high and so well that the gods join you in 
laughter and have sent you gently back again into the loving arms of mother 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
And it is inscribed with the day and time, Barbara's name and the name of her 
pilot, John Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
I am planning a balloon ride with one of the desert balloon charter pilots if I 
ever have $125 and a hunger for pot roast at the same time.

ROGER SIMON: VIRULENT FOOT-IN-MOUTH DISEASE STRIKES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROGER SIMON

<TEXT>
<P>
We all say things we later regret. I call these "Oh-my-God-isms." As in, "Oh my 
God, did I really say that?" 
</P>
<P>
The difference between us saying these things and public figures saying these 
things is that we have fewer people to apologize to afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a Texas politician said a very stupid thing, which almost goes with 
the territory in Texas. The trouble with Texas politics is that everybody there 
wants to sound "down-home." 
</P>
<P>
So they are always saying things like: "There's nothin' in the middle of the 
road 'cept a yellow line and dead skunks!" or "Being called a liar by my 
opponent is like being called ugly by a frog!" 
</P>
<P>
It can be a good technique, but sometimes you end up repeating these old 
sayings without even thinking about them. 
</P>
<P>
Saying things without thinking seems to be the specialty these days of Clayton 
Williams, the Republican candidate for governor of Texas. Williams recently 
decided to hold a cattle roundup at his ranch. It turned out to be a rainy, 
foggy day and so Williams decided to talk about the weather. 
</P>
<P>
This should have been a safe subject. But not with Clayton Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said bad weather was like rape. "If it's inevitable, just relax and 
enjoy it," he chortled. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody chortled back. 
</P>
<P>
I don't doubt that Williams had used that line lots of times before. But that 
was the problem. He didn't even think about what he was saying. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't stop and think that his comment was crude, hurtful, wrong and just 
plain stupid. 
</P>
<P>
When he was questioned about his comment, Williams at first dismissed it. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a joke," he said. "It wasn't a serious statement." Then he added, "If 
anyone's offended, I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a Republican women's club that we're having," he went on, proving 
no matter how stupid you have been, you can always be more stupid if you just 
apply yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a working cow camp -- a tough world where you get kicked in the testicles 
if you're not careful. It's a different world." 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, it is a different world. A world where jokes about women, blacks, 
Jews, homosexuals, the disabled, Poles, the Irish and about two dozen other 
groups aren't tolerated in public. Maybe some day they will not be tolerated in 
private either, but you have to start somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, a day later, Williams decided he was very, very sorry. 
</P>
<P>
"I apologize from the bottom of my heart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to know whether to have sympathy for Williams. Some do, believing he 
never meant to say what he said, that it was a true "Oh-my-God-ism." 
</P>
<P>
Others have survived similar stupid statements. Like when George Bush flew to 
New Orleans for the Republican Convention in 1988 and met Ronald Reagan on the 
airport Tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
Bush began showing off his grandchildren, including the children of his son Jeb 
and daughter-in-law Columba, who is a Latina. Bush referred to the 
grandchildren as "the little brown ones." 
</P>
<P>
There was an immediate outcry, but it was quickly muffled when later that same 
day Bush announced he had selected Dan Quayle as his running mate. The "little 
brown ones" got passed by as everybody concentrated on the big goofy one. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Nancy Reagan, who had a truly bizarre "Oh-my-God-ism" in 
February, 1980. She was campaigning for her husband in a suburb of Chicago 
while he was campaigning in New Hampshire. In one of those stunts that never 
seem to go right, she was talking to him on the phone while her comments were 
being carried by loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Reagan said he was looking at a beautiful 16-inch snowfall and Mrs. Reagan 
said how she wished he could be with her in Illinois to see "all these 
beautiful white people." 
</P>
<P>
As soon as she said it, she hesitated, turned pale and said softly: "I'm so 
sorry, I didn't mean it." 
</P>
<P>
And most people had sympathy for her because her statement was so screwy, it 
was pretty clear she didn't really mean it. 
</P>
<P>
Columnists rarely commit "Oh-my-God-isms" because copy editors read our stuff 
before it gets in the paper and thereby save us from ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Only once did I slip up badly, and this was at a wedding reception. A variety 
of liquid refreshments had been consumed and many of us were over-served by the 
time the toasts began. 
</P>
<P>
Which did not stop me from standing up and beginning a long and rambling toast 
that took note of the fact that the bride and groom had been living together 
for some time before the wedding. This would have been OK, except the parents 
of the bride had been unaware of this little fact. And I only learned they were 
unaware of it when the father of the bride stood and threw his champagne glass 
at my head. 
</P>
<P>
I sat down feeling dumb and embarrassed and wondering why on earth I had ever 
gotten up to speak in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
A friend sat next to me and told me not to feel bad, that we all say things we 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
But I notice you didn't get up and make a fool of yourself, I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right," he said. "Because I learned long ago that you never have to 
apologize for something you don't say." 
</P>
<P>
And that is such a good lesson, I wonder why more of us don't learn it.

ERMA BOMBECK: AT THE ROOT OF A HAIRY STEREOTYPE

<TEXT>
<P>
The three morning television shows have focused on an old question: "Do blondes 
have more fun and bigger ratings than brunettes?" 
</P>
<P>
For as long as I can remember, dark-haired women have been treated as an 
acquired taste -- like anchovies. They're the villains in novels, the 
stepmothers in fairy tales and the witches in films. They're represented by the 
Leona Helmsleys, the Alexises and the girls who never get the guys. 
</P>
<P>
If Jane Pauley had been blond, she never would have grown older. If Kathleen 
Sullivan had been blond, she never would have been replaced. If Zsa Zsa Gabor 
had been a brunette, she'd be making license plates in a penal institution 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what it is about light hair that seems to bring forth an image of 
goodness, innocence and vulnerability, but it has always been so, ever since 
golden-curly-headed, sweet, orphaned Shirley Temple triumphed over 
mean-spirited, spoiled, brattish Jane Withers. 
</P>
<P>
You have to wonder if Harry would have loved Sally if she'd had dark hair. 
Would Jane Russell have been the legend if she had gotten the bleach and 
Marilyn Monroe the dye? Would the world be rooting for Ivana if she had black 
hair? 
</P>
<P>
Some stars saw the handwriting on the contracts and changed the course of their 
careers by lightening up. I used to see Linda Evans on "The Rockford Files" as 
a brunette, but her career didn't really take off until she became blond 
Krystle on "Dynasty." Loni Anderson went unnoticed as a brunette; it wasn't 
until she emerged as a sexy blonde on "WKRP in Cincinnati" that she became a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that blondes still carry a stigma of their own -- that of being 
"dumb." 
</P>
<P>
How many blondes do you see in the U.S. Senate? Can you actually see Supreme 
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with platinum hair being treated with any 
credibility? Or Sen. Nancy Kassebaum or Elizabeth Dole being spoken to in words 
of more than three syllables if they were blondes? Forget the polls; I could 
have told Geraldine Ferraro that people don't vote for blondes for vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
I say you can't tell what's inside the package by the wrapping or the size of 
the box. Meryl Streep is blond and she's smart. Elizabeth Taylor is sexy and 
she's a brunette. 
</P>
<P>
We've been told too long that women are worth an expensive hair coloring. Maybe 
we should be rewarded for what we contribute to this world. That's what we're 
really worth. 
</P>
<P>
If I sound passionate about this, it's because I just had my roots dyed . . . 
sable brown.

Planning Commission Chairman Jim Serles has acknowledged that he 
"inadvertently" voted on two issues in violation of the state 
conflict-of-interest law, but said two other breach-of-ethics accusations 
stemmed from clerical errors that have since been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Serles, a candidate for the 3rd District City Council seat, was accused by his 
opponent, Doug Drummond, of violating the state Political Reform Act by 
accepting more than $250 in campaign donations from developers and businessmen, 
then voting in favor of four projects they brought to the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
City Prosecutor John Vander Lans said he hopes to make public the results of an 
investigation of the charges before the April 10 election. Serles, a dentist, 
and Drummond, a retired police commander, are vying for the council seat left 
open by Jan Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Vander Lans said he has concluded his investigation of four 
conflict-of-interest allegations, which are possible misdemeanors. But he 
declined to disclose his findings until a fifth charge -- that Serles 
misrepresented the value of donated office space -- is fully examined. A 
retired Los Angeles County sheriff's detective was hired by the city to examine 
that charge, and Vander Lans is pressing for a decision before the election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public is entitled to know something about this prior to the 
election," Vander Lans said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at his Naples home last week, Serles said he did indeed vote on 
two of his contributors' projects, but that one was an oversight and the other 
a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been beholden to anyone," he said. "These accusations are totally 
without merit." 
</P>
<P>
Serles said he accepted a $750 contribution from developer Dale Robinson four 
months before voting in favor of the developer's plans to build a two-unit 
condominium. The project was unanimously passed by the commission without 
discussion, along with several other non-controversial items, according to 
Serles. He said he was not aware that Robinson had contributed to his election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Serles also acknowledged voting for a 51-unit townhouse development after 
receiving a $600 contribution from realtor Larry Agajanian, but that the 
Planning Commission record identifying Agajanian as owner of the property is in 
error. 
</P>
<P>
Agajanian said in an interview that he had submitted an offer to buy the land, 
but has never owned it. 
</P>
<P>
Serles said he was unaware that it is necessary to abstain from voting if the 
contributor even participates in a project. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I have been informed that the word participant also is part of the 
regulation, I would excuse myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A third allegation accuses Serles of accepting $1,000 from developer Robert 
Kendrick, then voting on Kendrick's controversial plan to develop some 
abandoned Pacific Electric right of way. 
</P>
<P>
But Serles said the Planning Commission record was incorrect and that a tape 
recording of the proceeding shows he actually abstained. "I have never voted on 
a Kendrick issue," he said, adding that he returned the $1,000 to Kendrick 
nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the allegation was made, I wanted to make absolutely clear that if there 
was any potential conflict of interest, the integrity of the Planning 
Commission was foremost in my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth allegation, Serles is accused of voting for the expansion of the 
Belmonte restaurant on 2nd Street after he reported a $300 donation from its 
owner. But a check produced by Serles revealed that his campaign disclosure 
statement was in error, and the contributor was actually the owner's wife. 
Contributions by a spouse are not a violation, state officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The final charge accuses Serles of accepting donated office space with a value 
that exceeded the $1,000 campaign contribution limit. Drummond said he inquired 
about the value of the space and was quoted a price higher than the 
$300-a-month value Serles reported. 
</P>
<P>
Serles said he accepted the value the owner put on the space, which sat empty 
for more than two years before he moved in.

CONFLICT CHARGES, CITY-POLICE FRICTION ENLIVEN BASICALLY QUIET ELECTION SEASON

<P>
Such bread-and-butter issues as crime, police protection and services for 
constituents have dominated three council campaigns in this election season, 
otherwise spiced by conflict-of-interest charges hurled in one of the district 
races. 
</P>
<P>
With slightly more than a week to go before the April 10 elections, the 
campaigns have, for the most part, been relatively quiet, lacking the punch of 
some battles in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
The friction between city management and the police union has been evident in 
the election, with two union-backed retired police officers attempting to 
unseat incumbents and create a more favorable environment for the union in City 
Hall, which just ended a bitter labor fight with the union. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably absent from the roster of candidates are minorities, despite the 
fact that they make up about half the city's population. Only one woman is 
running for the council, whose only female incumbent, Jan Hall, is not seeking 
reelection in the 3rd District. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the nine council seats are up for election, but incumbents Warren 
Harwood of the 9th District and Ray Grabinski of the 7th District are 
unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Evan Anderson Braude faces three challengers in the downtown 1st 
District. One of them, former legislative assistant Joy Melton, is running a 
second time against Braude for the seat once occupied by her former boss, Marc 
Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
In the shoreline 3rd District, retired police Cmdr. Doug Drummond has 
complicated what many had considered would be an easy win for third-time 
contestant Jim Serles, who twice before lost bids for Hall's seat. Brandishing 
Planning Commission minutes and campaign donation reports, Drummond has accused 
Serles, a planning commissioner, of accepting contributions from developers and 
then improperly voting on their projects. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office is investigating, but Serles has produced evidence 
showing some of the alleged conflicts apparently stemmed from clerical errors. 
Serles has acknowledged that two votes were in violation of state ethics laws, 
but he says the votes were an oversight. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5th District in northeastern Long Beach, incumbent Les Robbins, a Los 
Angeles County deputy sheriff, is under fire from retired Long Beach Police 
Sgt. Max Baxter, a former police union board member who doesn't like Robbins' 
votes on various police matters.

SCHOOL DISTRICT CONSIDERS SHARING POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a break with tradition, Long Beach Unified School District officials are 
considering giving principals, teachers and possibly parents a greater voice in 
how their schools are run. 
</P>
<P>
The details have yet to be worked out, and there is already some disagreement 
on how much power will be handed over. But school board members and district 
administrators say they basically agree that those at the schools should have 
more flexibility and greater authority to decide what's best for their 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to let the persons working directly with students be responsible, and 
the district must give them the services to help," Supt. Tom Giugni said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers would like to play a bigger role in determining curriculum, schedules 
and how their school budget is spent, said Felice Strauss, president of the 
Teachers Assn. of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, for example, teachers on a textbook committee could not agree on a 
geometry book and suggested to the board that schools be free to pick the book 
they want. All schools now must use the same books. 
</P>
<P>
The changes may be as simple as giving teachers priority over school staff on 
the copying machine, or having an open supply room "so they don't have to go 
beg for supplies," Strauss said. Such small changes "can have a big effect on 
morale," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal, Strauss and other officials say, is to raise student 
achievement by allowing individual schools the power to tailor their programs 
to best fit their students' needs. If teachers at one school, for example, 
believe that teaching in teams would improve test scores, that alternative 
could be tried without school board approval. 
</P>
<P>
The board issues final decisions on all district matters after getting the 
superintendent's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to tell how much power teachers would have or what role parents 
would play. During a two-day retreat last weekend, the five board members were 
unanimous in their support of the concept, but two of them expressed concern 
about how much authority to give up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the parameters that are the sticking point," board President Jenny 
Oropeza told board members and administrators at the meeting on Santa Catalina 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Karin Polacheck said: "I'm not being true if I say, 'You can make 
any decision you want because you are the teacher and I trust you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The officials agreed to set up a committee of administrators, principals, 
teachers and other employees to decide the guidelines for possible management 
teams at each school. 
</P>
<P>
Oropeza and Polacheck said a board member also should be included on the 
committee. "We are having to give up, along with other folks, some of our 
turf," Oropeza said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Giugni warned, "the more you do that, the less chance you have for 
innovation. If this system works correctly, it's bottom up, not top down." 
</P>
<P>
Some issues the committee must decide: 
</P>
<P>
* Who would have final authority -- teachers, administrators, or parents -- 
over how things get done at each school. 
</P>
<P>
* At what point, if any, would the school board have veto power. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a school wants to kill its music program and use the money 
instead for something else, Oropeza said, she would want final say. 
</P>
<P>
But board member Harriet Williams replied: "If they did (kill a program,) I 
would live with that." 
</P>
<P>
"(Even) if your constituents are screaming?" Oropeza asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not being true to this whole thing if I say no to any one thing," Williams 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
While the issue of teacher involvement in decisions is in the discussion stage, 
Giugni has already decided on a district reorganization that would give 
principals more power. 
</P>
<P>
On July 1, the district's schools will be reorganized into six divisions, with 
one administrator overseeing a cluster of 11 to 15 schools. School officials 
now report to two assistant superintendents, too large a territory to 
supervise, according to Giugni. The elementary division assistant, for example, 
oversees all 59 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new organization, Giugni said, he expects the division administrators 
will be able to work more closely with the principals, providing them with 
guidance and greater supervision while giving principals greater flexibility to 
make changes. Principals also will will be held more accountable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It simply allows a good principal to function as a good principal by returning 
to the principal many discretionary powers," Giugni wrote in a report to the 
board last fall about his reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
The system of giving teachers and parents more authority -- called "shared 
decision-making" -- is being tried in a growing number of school districts. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, the school board adopted the same 
concept last June as part of its settlement of a teacher's strike. The 70 
schools participating in the program of school-based management set up councils 
that have made decisions in the areas of staff development, student discipline, 
event scheduling, use of school equipment and allotment of lottery money , 
among other things.

3 CHALLENGERS FACE BRAUDE IN 1ST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a trio of challengers eager to dislodge Councilman Evan Anderson Braude 
from his seat, the 1st District race is the most competitive of the City 
Council contests and the most likely to result in a June runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Braude's three opponents sound common themes while differing dramatically in 
style in their quest to represent a district that ranges across glitzy downtown 
high-rises, the port area, and crowded slums north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Former legislative aide Joy Melton is using homemade lemon loaves and leftover 
campaign signs from the last election to promote her attacks on Braude, who she 
says has failed to exhibit leadership on a number of critical district issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Stovall, a retired deputy police chief with a booming voice and the 
backing of the police union, is hoping to ride crime and police issues into 
office. 
</P>
<P>
And office manager Paul Croshaw has been walking his way through his first 
political campaign, shunning expensive mailers in favor of thank-you notes and 
scratch pads describing him as a "neighbor on your side." 
</P>
<P>
Their projected campaign budgets range from Melton's $10,000 to the $50,000 
Braude says he anticipates spending. 
</P>
<P>
In his campaign for a second term, Braude, 42, enjoys the endorsement of a 
number of organizations, ranging from the community political group, Long Beach 
Area Citizens Involved, to the Long Beach teachers' union and the Los Angeles 
County Federation of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Braude, an attorney for Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, is among the most liberal 
members of the council, taking a sometimes lonely stand on housing and social 
issues considered too bold or far-reaching by most of the council. He has, for 
example, favored unsuccessful proposals that would have required landlords to 
pay interest on security deposits, forced developers to include low-cost units 
in new apartment complexes and required developers of office buildings to 
contribute to a housing fund. 
</P>
<P>
His opponents contend that he can't muster votes for his positions, doesn't 
deal with constituent problems until they boil over, and hasn't paid adequate 
attention to the crime that has swept across his district and every other 
corner of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't done very much. He's the Rip Van Winkle of the district," asserted 
Stovall, a 57-year-old 1st District native whose red, white and blue campaign 
headquarters decorations include a banner with a heart declaring love for the 
U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
Stovall says the city's much disparaged yellow street lights should be changed 
to brighter ones, and that additional police officers should be paid for out of 
the general fund rather than a proposed new property tax levy supported by 
Braude. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're murdered at a higher rate than in history, I think safety is the 
basic responsibility of this city," said Stovall, who maintains the cost of new 
police hires has been exaggerated by city management, although he could not say 
what the real cost would be. 
</P>
<P>
Nor could Stovall say what social services he would cut if such budget paring 
were necessary to pay for new officers. He described the city's social programs 
as inadequate but characterized them as extras. "Those are the nice to have 
things," Stovall remarked. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to tell us what cuts he's going to make," countered Braude. "We've done 
all the taking (from the budget) we can take." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing ignorant of some of the city's housing policies, Stovall at first 
said he was under the impression that the city had adopted or was about to 
adopt inclusionary zoning requirements, under which developers would have to 
build a certain number of low-cost units in their projects. Informed that the 
proposal was actually rejected by the council last year, Stovall at first said 
he would oppose inclusionary zoning, then said later in the interview that he 
would probably support such a requirement. In general, however, he said: "I 
don't believe that there is a shortage of low-cost housing in this city." 
</P>
<P>
Melton charged that Braude "doesn't get out in the community and work with the 
people," saying, for example, that he waited too long to help residents 
complaining about Fender's International Grand Ballroom, which was eventually 
shut down by the city as a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of anybody who is in more places trying to deal with more 
issues," retorted Braude, saying he met several times with Fender's neighbors. 
Nonetheless, he does receive poor marks from the anti-Fender's group. "We felt 
he dragged his feet as much as he could," Scott Hunt, one of the group's 
leaders, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
A medical office worker who worked as a legislative aide for former 1st 
District Councilman Marc Wilder, Melton, 46, ran for the seat in 1986 after 
Wilder decided not to seek reelection. She came in third and is once again 
pursuing the seat with the help of downtown senior citizens and her family. Her 
mother makes the small lemon cakes that are carefully wrapped and handed out to 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Croshaw, a 29-year-old office manager for Paine Webber, is president of the 
local Junior Chamber of Commerce and president of the Long Beach Area 
Democratic Club. He has been walking the district for more than seven months 
and says he entered the race because "I wasn't getting phone calls returned 
from my local city councilman." 
</P>
<P>
He advocates police foot patrols, the tax levy for more police, inclusionary 
zoning and the establishment of a city-run shelter for the homeless. He says 
the city needs to make a greater effort to eliminate graffiti and to enforce 
housing codes. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're doing is tearing down old slums and putting up new slums and 
that's exactly what we have," Croshaw complained, saying the new apartment 
buildings he has seen while campaigning are already falling apart. BETTINA

YEAR-OLD CITY FACES ITS 2ND COUNCIL VOTE 
</P>

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just one year after voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood and elected their 
first City Council, candidates are at it again, canvassing neighborhoods and 
shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with the cityhood debate settled, nine candidates running for three 
council seats are promising everything from traffic signals to narcotics 
patrols to limits on apartment and condominium construction in Los Angeles 
County's newest city. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates include two incumbents, John Forbing and Gary Werner, and 
challengers Gregory Gaffney, Cleve Holifield, Jay Kim, Thomas Ortiz, Jim Paul, 
Garry Stitt and Bryan Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Forbing, 47, said the council has done a "good job in the first year. I feel 
I'm more qualified now than when voters first elected me to the council." 
</P>
<P>
Forbing, an agent for the State Farm Insurance Cos. in Pomona and a former 
board member for the Walnut Valley Unified School District, pointed to Diamond 
Bar's budget, which has a $750,000 surplus for the 1989-90 fiscal year, as one 
indication that the council has exercised good local government while keeping 
costs at a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
That was accomplished, he emphasized, even though the city has been operating 
without $1.2 million in property taxes. Because of a technicality related to 
the date of its incorporation, the city is barred from receiving property tax 
revenues during fiscal year 1989-90. The Legislature is considering a bill that 
would give Diamond Bar the money. 
</P>
<P>
Forbing is going after votes from people who don't normally turn out for City 
Council races. Last year, 38.8% of 24,500 registered voters participated in 
Diamond Bar's election. This year, telephoning residents at random, Forbing's 
campaign committee learned that "many didn't even know there was an election 
coming up," he said. Forbing said he is sending those people absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Werner, 39, former head of the city's Incorporation Committee, said: "The 
cityhood issue is now behind us. Now it's a matter of forming a strong local 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Werner, owner of Community Development Consulting Services, said the City 
Council must expedite street and freeway improvements that will bring sound 
commercial development to Diamond Bar. In addition, he said, the city should 
increase its efforts to crack down on drug traffic and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Werner, who finished third in the 1989 election, is planning to quadruple his 
campaign war chest this year. His goal is to spend $17,000, compared with 
$4,000 for his first council bid. Forbing is budgeting $12,000, compared with 
the $10,700 he spent last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got more to protect this time," Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney, 27, a data-base administrator at AST Research Inc. in Irvine, said his 
main concern is crime, especially car thefts. 
</P>
<P>
"The rate is going up tremendously," he said. Gaffney, who is vice president of 
the Diamond Bar Improvement Assn., said he would also encourage the formation 
of additional neighborhood watch programs. Gaffney finished 19th in the council 
election last March. 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney criticized Councilmen Paul Horcher and Gary Miller, who have sought 
higher office, saying: "We need some individuals who are going to be here for 
the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who lost a special election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by 
the resignation of William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), is not running for 
reelection. Horcher, whose council term expires in 1992, is running for the 
Assembly seat of Frank Hill (R-Whittier), the Republican nominee for Campbell's 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
While other candidates have been hesitant to openly criticize city government, 
Holifield, 56, strongly objects to the council's ousting of Horcher from his 
post as mayor pro tem. Horcher was removed after a falling-out with Miller 
during the state Senate race. Horcher, who was supporting Hill in the race, had 
accused Miller of conflict-of-interest violations. 
</P>
<P>
Holifield, a project engineer for General Dynamics Corp. in Pomona, also is 
running for the second time. He said a good track record of community service 
has won him the support of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
He was on Diamond Bar's Municipal Advisory Council from 1984 to 1989 and was 
chairman four years. In 1989, he ran unsuccessfully for the school board in the 
Pomona Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Holifield received the seventh-highest number of votes and spent 
only $400 -- "the most votes for the dollar," he said. This time, he has set a 
ceiling of $3,000 for campaign expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, 50, is on the other end of the spectrum when it comes to campaign 
spending. He said he has budgeted $25,000, including $10,000 of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, owner of Diamond Bar-based Jaykim Engineers Inc., said his extensive 
background in city planning and traffic issues, including serving as city 
engineer and traffic engineer in several cities, would benefit Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Kim said, his top priority would be construction of the Tonner 
Canyon Parkway, proposed to run north-south through Orange and San Bernardino 
counties. The road, part of the settlement of a suit between San Bernardino and 
Diamond Bar, is expected to siphon off traffic from Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Kim said he would support the establishment of joint benefit assessment 
districts to pay for the road, though some residents are against that 
financing. Such districts pay for public works projects by assessing developers 
or homeowners. "That's what people are upset about," he said, "but I don't 
think the city has any choice." 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, 55, a retired Santa Ana police officer and chairman of Diamond Bar's 
Traffic and Transportation Committee, said each council member "should have a 
different personality, so you have five different ways of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, who ran for the council last year, said he wants to limit the apartments 
and condominiums in Diamond Bar and to increase the number of sheriff's 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see graffiti, gangs and prostitution," he said. "I want safety 
for everyone who lives in Diamond Bar." 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz's largest donation comes from his daughter's and son-in-law's employer, 
Carl N. Karcher, chairman of Carl Karcher Enterprises, which owns Carl's Jr. 
restaurants. Karcher contributed $1,000 to the campaign. Ortiz said he plans to 
spend $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Paul, 49, is campaigning on a platform of "no special interests." The retired 
Los Angeles County paramedic said he is not soliciting contributions and has 
even turned down offers by two local businesses to give money to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Paul also said he strongly supports a bill submitted by Rep. David Dreier (R-La 
Verne) that would redraw U.S. postal boundaries so that cities wouldn't have to 
share ZIP codes. Currently, residents and businesses in northwest Diamond Bar, 
including Paul, share the 91789 ZIP code with Walnut and must use a Walnut 
mailing address. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, learning that sales tax revenue from those businesses was 
accidentally diverted to Walnut, lobbied Dreier to submit legislation to 
rectify the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Stitt, 39, a sales specialist for RJR Nabisco Group and a member of Diamond 
Bar's Parks and Recreation Commission, said he wants to control the spread of 
commercial projects in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really anti-development," he said. "It's just that we have so many 
Italian places, so many pizza places. We need to take time and maybe just slow 
the development down. We need a chance to breathe." 
</P>
<P>
Stitt, a 20-year resident of Diamond Bar, considers himself "a dark-horse 
candidate" because he isn't one of the five who ran last year and because he 
has fewer contacts in the business community than other contenders. "But I'm 
giving it my best shot." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 21, a senior at Cal Poly Pomona, is probably the least visible 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
He said he "started out with a lot of enthusiasm" but was distracted by the 
demands of a full class schedule and round-the-clock business commitments. He 
said the only campaigning he's had time to do is among fellow students, and he 
won't be able to make it to any of the five candidate forums. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I've had to let the campaign slide," Thomas said in a telephone 
interview. "I'm kind of bummed about that. It's been kind of a halfhearted 
effort."

TABLES TURN ON SERLES IN 3RD DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1982, it's been Jim Serles who ran the grass-roots campaign for the 3rd 
District City Council seat, Serles who was outspent by his opponent and Serles 
who came close, but not close enough, to defeating political nemesis Jan Hall. 
</P>
<P>
This year, incumbent Hall decided not to run again, and the tables have turned. 
Now it's Serles doing the outspending, winning the support of the Long Beach 
Establishment and abandoning the home-grown effort for a campaign guided by a 
paid consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has a new nemesis -- retired Police Cmdr. Doug Drummond -- who came to 
the race armed with conflict-of-interest charges that have put Serles' campaign 
on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding claims that Serles -- chairman of the city Planning 
Commission -- took campaign contributions from realtors and developers and then 
voted in favor of their projects will likely be put to rest before the polls 
open April 10. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office is pressing to wrap up a two-pronged investigation 
before the vote and Serles has produced evidence showing some of the alleged 
conflicts apparently stemmed from clerical errors. The two times he did vote in 
violation of state ethics laws, he says, were the result of oversight rather 
than corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Serles, a 49-year-old dentist, and Drummond, a 52-year-old part-time college 
instructor, are battling to represent a wealthy district that straddles Pacific 
Coast Highway from Atherton Street on the north to the ocean on the south, 
taking in posh communities such as Naples, Belmont Shore and the Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Running a more sedate campaign in his third bid for public office is Lou 
Mirabile, a retired auto dealer who refused to disclose his age. According to 
Department of Motor Vehicles records, Mirabile is 75. 
</P>
<P>
While Mirabile has spent scarcely a penny on his effort, Serles has emerged 
among the top local political spenders. According to campaign expense reports, 
he raised $151,800 and spent $90,840 through the last week in March. In the 
same time, Drummond raised $35,600 and spent $21,500. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout from the ethics flap remains to be seen, but if endorsements are an 
indicator, the damage seems limited. Serles is backed by the Long Beach Area 
Citizens Involved, a local political watchdog group; Long Beach Firefighters 
Local 372, and the Teachers Assn. of Long Beach. He also has been endorsed by 
the Press-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
And, despite Drummond's 29 years on the police force, the California 
Organization of Police and Sheriffs and the Long Beach Police Officers Assn. 
backed Serles. Drummond said his supporters include Dentists for Drummond, a 
25-member group he contends is still growing. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the police union fail to endorse Drummond, its president, Mike 
Tracy, virtually accused him of stealing office furniture, namely a brown 
leather chair on wheels. Drummond says the chair was a gift and he is 
considering suing Tracy for making such a statement during a local public 
affairs show on the community-access cable television channel in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I used that chair for a year when I sat as a commander in the Long Beach 
Police Department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Serles and Drummond both were born and raised in Long Beach, define themselves 
as "moderately conservative," agree crime is the city's No. 1 problem and say 
the police force is too small. But most similarities end there. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond says the homeless are not the city's responsibility; Serles says the 
city shouldn't turn its back on them. Drummond says developers should not be 
required to pay for low-income housing; Serles says he believes they should. 
Drummond opposes a Citizen Police Complaint Commission in favor of a stronger 
police commission; Serles supports it. 
</P>
<P>
Serles has endorsed the June ballot measure calling for a special tax levy to 
pay for 75 more police officers, but says future money should come from airport 
user fees rather than higher taxes. He wants to expand the authority of 41 
marine security officers and 28 port officers who are armed and uniformed but 
powerless to arrest and transport suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an under-utilization of manpower," Serles said. "Crime is up 16% in 
the 3rd District. Assaults are up 34.7%. The city has 100,000 more people than 
it did in 1970 and there are 100 fewer officers." 
</P>
<P>
Drummond wants a ratio of two officers for every 1,000 residents and said the 
city must add 75 officers a year through 1995 for adequate protection. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he supports the special tax levy, but only this time. He proposes 
boosting the ailing retail sales tax base by renovating sluggish shopping malls 
for future funds. That failing, Drummond believes the city should contract with 
the county sheriff for law enforcement services as "an absolute bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
On the homeless problem, Drummond says the responsibility lies with the county, 
state and federal governments rather than the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the state as the provider of mental health care . . . and housing has 
been a federal service for some time," Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
Countered Serles: "We have to accept responsibility as a city. . . . We have 
people who are down and out, people who come looking for employment, these 
people need assistance. We cannot turn our backs." 
</P>
<P>
Serles favors building a homeless drop-in shelter, an idea Drummond says he 
would only consider. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond is against requiring developers to build some low-income units in 
apartment complexes -- seen by some as a way to prevent homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Serles endorses such a plan in limited areas of the city -- such as downtown, 
along major arteries and near the university -- but believes the character of 
neighborhoods should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Third candidate Mirabile declined to discuss specific issues. "I don't know 
anything about issues. I don't believe in all these issues. We talk about them 
but nothing ever happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He did say that crime is a major problem.FAYE FIORE

SAM HALL KAPLAN: SLOUCHING TOWARD REGIONAL SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A road repair project in Alhambra backs up traffic in San Gabriel and San 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Water runoff in the Pacific Palisades pollutes Santa Monica Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Acrid smoke from the refineries in Torrance drifts over Carson and Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
An office tower in West Hollywood shades residences across the street in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the arbitrary nature of political boundaries is being exposed as 
the region's 168-and-counting municipalities and special districts continue to 
grow and crowd each other. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that regionalism is beginning to be taken seriously as a concept 
of government to deal with the critical problems of air pollution, water 
quality, traffic congestion, waste disposal, growth management and the 
jobs-housing balance. 
</P>
<P>
And that is no joke for this April Fool's Day. 
</P>
<P>
For years, mentioning regionalism in planning, development and political 
circles, entwined as they are like an Olympic symbol, was sure to generate 
snickers and laughs. "Local government give up some of its approval powers? 
You've got to be kidding," the pundits would say. 
</P>
<P>
But it has become apparent that the growing list of problems affecting the 
region's quality of life is simply beyond the grasp of local governments. 
</P>
<P>
And it is equally apparent that the various attempts to handle them so far on a 
county level have resulted in a bureaucratic gridlock that matches our traffic 
gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
At the wheel in the middle of the mess has been a somnolent state. 
</P>
<P>
We are not talking simply political theory here. This is about how government 
works, and doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when Los Angeles County recently proposed to relieve rush-hour 
congestion on a major boulevard by simply synchronizing traffic signals, it 
found that the 75 signals involved were in nine cities, and that a few of the 
cities didn't want them changed because it would inconvenience a few of their 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider the continuing, nasty battle between the county Transportation 
Commission and the Southern California Rapid Transit District over the design 
and construction of rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the agencies has been described as "two hogs pushing each other 
away from the trough." They are spending millions in lawsuits against each 
other while squeezing dimes out of bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the current controversy over the Marina Place Mall proposed on a 
sliver of Culver City at the northeast corner of Washington and Lincoln 
boulevards, surrounded on three sides by Los Angeles. Culver City would get the 
taxes and Venice the traffic, so Los Angeles is rightfully complaining. 
</P>
<P>
However, when Culver City complained a few years ago about a proposed mall a 
block away on Maxella Avenue just within the boundaries of Los Angeles, it was 
ignored. The mall has since been built, dumping traffic in Culver City. So 
turns the screw. 
</P>
<P>
These protracted conflicts between jurisdictions were ruefully noted in the Los 
Angeles 2000 report issued last year. 
</P>
<P>
To begin facing up to these conflicts, L.A. 2000 recommended a metropolitan 
growth management agency to set policy and provide guidelines for developments 
"with area-wide impacts." Also recommended was a metropolitan environmental 
quality agency. They were the first shots in this latest barrage on behalf of 
regionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), the one 
governmental body at present empowered to make binding regional decisions, 
issued a bold plan to deal with smog. The plan establishes a strict set of 
anti-pollution standards and a timetable for their implementation. Special 
districts and special interests squealed. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is overlaying local government with a set of constraints, 
not obliterating it," said AQMD executive officer James Lents. 
</P>
<P>
However, the AQMD has recognized that its goals will not be met if the region 
does not begin dealing realistically with traffic and growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
This point also was emphasized in a recent Southern California Assn. of 
Governments report. Its concerns are prologues to a proposed state proposition 
(No. 111 on the June ballot), tying transportation to land-use planning within 
a regional framework. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," said Lents in a recent interview, "environmental and 
transportation problems are making regional government a reality. The question 
is not whether we will eventually have a regional government, but rather how 
extensive it will be." 
</P>
<P>
These are questions on the agenda of the recently established Lewis Center for 
Regional Studies at UCLA. The hope is that the center will not become yet 
another self-serving academic exercise, benefitting just the administrators and 
professors involved, and actually wade into the political muck composed of 
local and special interest groups where policy and public opinion is formed. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to be attentive and make a difference," promised the center's Allen 
Scott, a geographer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an interesting experiment in the nitty-gritty aspects of regionalism 
has been launched by the less academic and more reality-oriented UCLA Extension 
public policy program, headed by LeRoy Graymer. He is serving as facilitator to 
a landmark attempt by five Westside cities to coordinate traffic and growth 
management efforts affecting each other. 
</P>
<P>
Putting these actions in a broader perspective, and stirring the hearts of 
regionalists, was a report a few months ago by the California Assembly Office 
of Research, entitled "Getting Ahead of the Growth Curve." 
</P>
<P>
The report cited the ineffectiveness of an array of governmental entities to 
deal with a range of issues, including air and water quality and traffic. The 
report concluded with a call for management on a regional level. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown introduced a bill, AB 4242, that 
would merge various air and water quality boards and transportation planning 
agencies into seven distinct regional governing bodies across the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles region would consist of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San 
Bernardino, Ventura and Imperial counties. Although the bill is not given much 
of a chance of passage at this time, it is seen as a sort of feather in the 
wind to test the political sentiments for regionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the traditional distrust of regionalism by conservatives and home-rule 
advocates, there is now the issue of emerging minority politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, regionalism is rising just at a time when politically active 
ethnics are getting a local foothold," observed Alan Kreditor, dean of USC's 
School of Urban and Regional Planning. He expressed the concern that 
regionalism would sap local vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Kreditor also commented that the assembly report, and the bill, were in effect 
admissions by the Legislature that the increasing problems associated with 
growth cannot be solved on the state level, and that it was proposing a new 
level of government, the region, to abdicate its responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Regionalism is no longer a joke; but then again neither is the condition of our 
air and water, our waste disposal methods, the lack of housing and a decent 
public education system, traffic and generally our diminishing quality of life.

AT HOME: CITY PROUD OF PROGRESS SHRUGS OFF GAG; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK: MOVING CAUTIOUSLY, THE CITY IS PROUD OF ITS SCHOOLS, POLICE AND OTHER 
PUBLIC SERVICES. HOME VALUES COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH NEARBY COMMUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, Bates, a former editor at the Herald-Examiner, is a free-lance 
writer who lives on Mt. Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every couple of weeks on late-night television, Johnny Carson revives it again, 
that running gag about NBC's home in "Beautiful Downtown Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
Many people in town shrug it off or smile at the intended sarcasm, but it fails 
to amuse Burbank Mayor Robert R. Bowne, who has lived in the city for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious to anyone who drives around that we're kind of cosmopolitan," 
Bowne said. "We're home to some major corporate players. It's not like Burbank 
is some Podunk little town." 
</P>
<P>
And while the city can boast of impressive business complexes housing Lockheed, 
Disney Co., Warner Brothers Inc. and Burbank Studios, most people seem to like 
Burbank's small-town ambience. 
</P>
<P>
People greet each other on Olive Avenue; their kids walk home alone from 
school. There's free parking and a pretty little garden of poppies at the 
central library. Two concrete eagles guard the steps to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Burbank has its share of tacky mini-malls and ubiquitous doughnut 
shops. Litter blows across the parking lot at Toys R Us. The J C Penney on 
North Golden Mall Street shows her age. 
</P>
<P>
But the downtown crosswalks are neatly squared off with red brick these days, 
and just down the way, on 41 acres of land adjacent to the Golden State 
Freeway, bulldozers are pushing Burbank into the 21st Century as they clear the 
way for a $250-million shopping mall, Burbank Gateway Center. 
</P>
<P>
The mall seems to many residents a sign that Burbank has come of age, and there 
is in this historic city at the mouth of the San Fernando Valley, a palpable 
excitement about the mall's award-winning design, and the stature it will bring 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
But like everything else in Burbank, the mall was approached with caution. 
Nineteen years of caution, in which outspoken constituents voiced their 
determination to preserve Burbank's quiet, residential flavor. 
</P>
<P>
"Burbank isn't willing to let the ills of urban America overwhelm it," said 
Timothy Crowner, director of pupil services for the Burbank Unified School 
District, where in spite of a much pubicized incident of student violence and 
subsequent teacher unrest last year, the dropout rate is about 5% and most 
students still go on to college or trade school. 
</P>
<P>
"Burbank reminds me of the little Midwestern towns I grew up in, and it's 
fighting hard to stay that way," Crowner said. 
</P>
<P>
John Reade, who directs production services for Disney's motion picture 
department, relocated last year to Burbank to be closer to his job. 
</P>
<P>
While he found the move from Marina del Rey a "culture shock," he also found a 
2,250-square-foot, 3-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath condominium with high ceilings, a 
garden room and a designer bathroom on north Magnolia Street in the Burbank 
hill area for $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really liked about it is that it's not a square box condo. It's got 
angles and corners you can do a lot with," Reade said. 
</P>
<P>
Once he got used to living in Burbank, Reade discovered it to be a friendly, 
cozy town. He said he likes the coffee shops and the chatty neighbors, the 
coming shopping mall and the efficient city services. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent Jerry Hungerford of The Prudential California Realty took 
some pride in finding Reade a $250,000 condominium larger than most houses. 
</P>
<P>
Hungerford calls Burbank "a diamond in the rough," where a house costs less 
than the same house would cost in the nearby communities of Encino, Sherman 
Oaks or Glendale, albeit, a little more than in North Hollywood or Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the fact that when you call the Police Department, they come," said 
Jeannie Flavins, an Apple Valley native who moved five years ago to Burbank 
with her husband, Tom, who is now a member of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics bear her out. The Burbank police have an average three-minute 
response time, and showed a 5.6% drop in major crimes last year even as crime 
rose in nearly every other Los Angeles area municipality, said Capt. Dave 
Newsham of the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Newsham, a Burbank resident himself, said in many respects living in Burbank is 
like "stepping back in time." 
</P>
<P>
"To me," he said, " Burbank remains kind of like an island in the megalopolis." 
</P>
<P>
Once home to sheep ranches, vineyards, peach orchards and briefly even a garlic 
factory, Burbank sits on a site purchased by San Francisco dentist David 
Burbank and his wife, Clara, in 1867 for less than a dollar an acre. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank, in turn, sold 9,000 acres to the Providencia Land, Water &amp; 
Development Co. for $250,000 in 1886. A town was established and the company 
began selling property, mostly for five-room houses at $400 to $500, in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank's population of 93,500 has not grown much since the 1950s. In part, 
that's why the city seems to residents pretty much the same as it did in the 
days when freckle-faced Ron Howard was graduating from John Burroughs High 
School or even when Debbie Reynolds went to cross-town rival Burbank High. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the well-to-do residents live along the slopes of the towering, 
rocky Verdugo Hills that hug the city's northern boundaries. Prices range from 
the high $600,000s to a $2.5-million mansion on Viewcrest Drive with a circular 
oak staircase, leaded windows, an indoor pool framed by 12 French doors and a 
tennis court overlooking the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank's scenic views come as a surprise to people who only come to the city 
to visit the Price Club warehouse store or to catch a plane at Burbank's 
regional airport, said real estate agent Hungerford. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Annette Ludwig of Century 21 Larson Realty is listing a newly 
renovated, two-bedroom, two-bath 1929 Spanish villa with panoramic views from 
the dining room, living room and bedroom windows that take in everything from 
Griffith Park to Burbank Airport, from the Glendale and downtown Los Angeles 
skylines to the Verdugo Mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
A young couple has nearly gutted the interior, installing new wiring, plumbing 
and central air and heat, laying hardwood floors and reroofing and restuccoing 
the exterior. The beamed living room, with a fireplace, measures 30 by 18 feet, 
and the price is $459,000. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Glendale the house would cost almost $50,000 more, Ludwig said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the relative values of Burbank housing, the market has not been immune 
to the soaring prices throughout the region. It is hard to place young families 
in a first home in Burbank, Hungerford said. He can show them a tiny 
two-bedroom bungalow that needs work for $172,500, across the street from a 
larger house he sold for $94,000 just five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mo Jones of the Burbank Board of Realtors said the average sales price for a 
single-family residence in Burbank hovered near $230,000 at the end of 
February. 
</P>
<P>
In that price range, Ludwig is showing a $279,500, 1,750-square-foot house on 
North Niagra Street that features 3 bedrooms, 1 3/4 baths, wood paneling, 
ceiling fans, two Palo Verdes stone fireplaces and a covered patio. 
</P>
<P>
The Flavins, who came from Apple Valley, started more modestly when they moved 
into their first house five years ago, but they found that 1,000 square feet 
seemed to shrink with each child. After their second, Megan, was born, they 
determined to move, but only if they could find an affordable, more spacious 
house with amenities they needed. 
</P>
<P>
Ten blocks away, they were able to buy a house for $342,500 that had fallen out 
of escrow. Worried about their children playing near the oversized pool in the 
back yard, they negotiated to have it replaced with a lawn as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"My priority was getting 1 3/4 baths," Jeannie Flavins said. "When I found out 
this house had 2 3/4, I was just doing handstands. 
</P>
<P>
"Our down payment came entirely from the equity in our old house, and now we're 
in a place where our family can grow." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank's family appeal was also what led Loris Warner and her husband, Donald, 
to decide to raise their family in the city after their marriage 34 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in a two-bedroom home for $13,500, they moved to a three-bedroom house 
in 1962, paying $20,000, and jumped to a four-bedroom, four-bath house on 
Country Club Drive, paying just $60,000 in 1971. Houses nearby are selling 
today for $400,000 to $450,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A child of Glendale, she at first was slightly reluctant to move to Burbank in 
1956 with her new husband: "Glendale was a little snobbish about the (San 
Fernando) Valley," she said. Times change, though, and so did Loris Warner, an 
active member of the Burbank Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come to very much love Burbank," she said. "It's a very close-knit, 
family-type city."

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: DANGER OF A 'NET LISTING' IS SELLER MAY AGREE TO PRICE 
THAT IS TOO LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We live in a very desirable neighborhood where homes rarely come on 
the market. About the only time a home is sold occurs when the owner dies. Last 
week a local realtor knocked on our door. She claimed to have buyers interested 
in purchasing a home in our neighborhood and asked if we might like to sell "if 
the price is right." 
</P>
<P>
The agent asked how much we wanted to net for our home. When my husband named a 
price, the agent said if we would give her a listing at this price she could 
sell our home within a week. Nothing was mentioned about a sales commission. 
When the agent pushed us to sign a listing, I said, "We would like to think it 
over." Is this type of net sales price for homes now customary? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: No. The type of listing the real estate agent suggested is called a 
"net listing." It is illegal in some states and very dangerous in every state. 
I'm glad you didn't sign that listing, because your net price might have been 
too low. 
</P>
<P>
Since the agent would receive any amount the buyer pays above your net price, 
the agent might obtain a higher than normal sales commission. Perhaps the 
reason the agent was so anxious was because your net price was too low. 
</P>
<P>
Before any home seller signs a listing, the real estate agent should show the 
seller, in writing, a "comparative market analysis." This form shows recent 
sales prices of similar nearby homes, as well as the asking prices of 
comparable neighborhood houses now on the market for sale. Only after you have 
this information are you in a position to determine the proper asking price for 
your home. 
</P>
<P>
Some realty agents hate me for suggesting this, but I must advise you to 
interview at least three agents before selecting the best one. Competition for 
your listing prevents one agent from getting you to list at too low or too high 
a price. 
</P>
<P>
Also, insist that each agent provide you with references of previous sellers. 
Phone those clients to ask: "Were you in any way unhappy with your agent and 
would you list your home for sale again with the same agent?" 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a reader recently suggested asking each agent you interview: "With 
which insurance company do you have E&amp;O (errors and omissions) insurance 
and has your firm been sued within the last three years?" Beware of any agent 
who does not have E&amp;O insurance. You will soon know which agent should 
receive your exclusive (not net) listing. 
</P>
<P>
How to Make Money in Real Estate Today 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently, I read the March 1990 issue of Playboy. I was especially 
fascinated with the long interview of real estate investor Donald Trump. 
Although he has earned many millions from his Atlantic City casinos, over and 
over he referred to his sound real estate investments. However, most of us are 
not in a financial position to buy the Plaza Hotel or other New York City 
properties. For the average investor, what do you think is the best way to earn 
big profits in real estate today? 
</P>
<P>
A: Trump invests primarily in real estate-oriented businesses, such as hotels 
and casinos, which produce tremendous cash flow. However, such operations can 
be extremely risky, as Merv Griffin would undoubtedly tell us. 
</P>
<P>
For average real estate investors who are not in Trump's league, the best 
investments are properties that can be improved to increase their market value 
by more than the cost of the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
I like to buy run-down fixer-upper houses that can be renovated. I specialize 
in the low end of the market because there will always be buyers for less 
expensive houses. Recently, I read about a fellow who bought a house, fixed it 
up and is complaining because he can't find a buyer for it at its $1.2 million 
appraised value. That is not my idea of a fixer-upper house. 
</P>
<P>
But the same principle of adding value to real estate by raising its market 
value by more than the cost of the improvements is not new. Home builders do it 
every day, as do builders of skyscraper office buildings. However, I feel the 
risk of upgrading the cheaper single-family houses is minimal and is within the 
reach of most investors. Another benefit is it is hard to make a mistake on a 
single-family house, but it is easy to make a big mistake on commercial 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Home Buyer Reports Warranty Valuable 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know you are not a big fan of one-year home warranties, but I thought you 
should know of my favorable experience. Within a month after I bought my 
"bachelorette pad" home the water heater blew up. I came out to the garage and 
it was filled with steam from the water heater. After shutting it off, I called 
the home warranty company, which sent out a plumber with a replacement water 
heater. My only cost was the $35 service fee. 
</P>
<P>
About a month later, the dishwasher began leaking badly. The serviceman said it 
was rusted out and he replaced the dishwasher for only the $35 service fee. 
Last September, when I had the furnace checked, I learned the firebox was 
cracked. The warranty company replaced the entire furnace for only a $35 
service fee. I understand my one-year warranty policy cost the home seller 
about $300, but I thought you should know it was a major incentive for me to 
buy and I am glad I had the warranty policy. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for sharing your successful home warranty policy experience. 
However, I receive many letters complaining about these policies, which seem to 
have as many exclusions as they do inclusions. 
</P>
<P>
These policies pay for repairs or replacements of plumbing, wiring, built-in 
appliances, furnace and water heater. Some companies charge an extra premium 
for including air conditioning, swimming pool and the roof. But most one-year 
home warranty policies do not cover the foundation, plumbing outside the home's 
foundation, the roof and detached buildings such as a garage. 
</P>
<P>
Since the seller paid for your one-year home warranty policy, you had 
everything to gain from such coverage. Many real estate agents buy these 
policies for their buyers because they know such coverage often avoids problems 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of Agents Who Ask for Advance Fee 
</P>
<P>
Q: We own land in Arizona, which we would gladly sell. In the last few months 
we have been contacted by several real estate agents who claim they have buyers 
for our land. But they want six-month listings, plus a "listing fee" to pay for 
advertising and sales promotion. I can understand the six-month listing, but 
the listing fee makes me wonder. Is such a fee customary? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Advance listing fees or advertising fees are not customary. Most 
reputable agents do not charge advance fees. Their sole compensation comes from 
the sales commission, which is payable when they find a buyer for the listed 
property. Selling vacant desert land is not easy, but any agent soliciting your 
listing should have enough confidence in his ability not to have to charge an 
advance fee. Be very careful. 
</P>
<P>
Should They Move or Remodel House? 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I have been discussing possibly buying a larger home. But we 
hesitate to move because our mortgage has a low interest rate and we like our 
neighborhood. An alternative is to add another bathroom and bedroom to our 
present home. What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
A: Before you decide, look at larger new and resale homes. Spend a few weekends 
visiting open houses held by home builders and realtors. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to buy, sell your old home before purchasing a replacement home. 
The reason is that you don't want to be under pressure to accept the first 
offer that comes along for your old home. But an alternative is to make your 
home purchase offer contingent on the sale of your old home. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you like your present home and its neighborhood, get cost estimates 
for adding the improvements you desire. Talk with several contractors to get 
their estimates. In case you haven't noticed, the home remodeling industry is 
booming because many homeowners have decided it is wiser to upgrade their 
current homes than to buy another. 
</P>
<P>
Should Near-Retiree Buy Seattle Rental? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am about six years away from retirement and won't have much income except 
Social Security and a modest pension. My brother lives in the Seattle area and 
is encouraging me to buy a rental house there because he says the market is 
booming. Do you think I should invest in the Seattle area in hopes the property 
might go up in value by the time I retire? My brother would manage it for me. 
</P>
<P>
A: Real estate booms rarely last more than a year or two. Seattle, Sacramento 
and a few other areas are doing very well today, but there is no guarantee that 
home prices will continue to rapidly appreciate in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you live in an economically depressed area, you will probably do just as 
well investing close to home where you can watch your properties. Personally, I 
won't buy more than a 30-minute drive from my home, because I want to be 
familiar with the communities where I invest. If you decide to invest far from 
your home, please only use cash you can afford to lose. 
</P>
<P>
How Newlyweds Can Avoid Tax on Sales 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently married a beautiful lady. She owns a condo and I own a townhouse 
where we now live. We would like to sell the condo and townhouse so we can buy 
a single-family house where we can begin raising our family. Her net sale 
profit will be about $8,000 and mine will be around $18,000. If we both go on 
the title to the house we buy together, is there any way we can avoid having to 
pay taxes on our sale profits? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. You can both defer the profit taxes on the sale of your principal 
residences if within 24 months before or after the sales you buy a replacement 
principal residence that costs more than the total sales prices of the two 
homes. IRS Revenue Ruling 75-238 approves such tax deferral. 
</P>
<P>
Inherited Property Is Subject to Estate Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q: A few weeks ago, you ran a letter about a lady who received a house as a 
gift from her mother, but she had to take over her mother's low cost basis for 
the house. You said it would have been better for her to inherit the house, 
because then the daughter's basis would be stepped-up to market value on the 
date of the mother's death. If the daughter had inherited the house, wouldn't 
its value have been subject to estate tax? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. However, there is a $600,000 federal estate tax exemption, and many 
states have no inheritance tax. If the property has substantially appreciated 
in market value, it is usually better to inherit property than receive it by 
gift before death. Please consult your tax adviser for more details. 
</P>
<P>
Are Mobile Homes a Good Investment? 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think of mobile homes as investments? I have read in your 
articles about the profits of renting mobile homes to tenants. But what about 
investing in mobile homes? Do they appreciate in value like houses? What are 
the pros and cons? 
</P>
<P>
A: Mobile homes usually do not appreciate in market value. Instead, they 
depreciate much like your automobile loses value. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile homes usually are not as well built as typical single-family homes. 
Also, their surroundings are often not as attractive as detached houses. 
However, mobile homes usually rent for a high rent as a percentage of their 
market value. Most owners of mobile homes report excellent rental profits. But 
the maintenance costs can be substantial. If you own the mobile-home park, of 
course you can earn additional income from renting lots to mobile-home owners.

Most home buyers have heard about the new rules for deducting interest on their 
acquisition or improvement mortgage up to $1 million (or existing home 
mortgages as of Oct. 13, 1987) plus up to $100,000 of home equity debt secured 
by the residence. 
</P>
<P>
But there are additional tax deductions for homeowners and real estate 
investors that are often overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called 1986 Tax Reform Act greatly restricted interest deductions for 
consumers. Interest for debt such as auto loans, credit cards and unsecured 
personal loans will not be deductible after 1990. 
</P>
<P>
However, interest on loans secured by a primary and second residence remains 
fully deductible (subject to the $1 million and $100,000 limits). As a result, 
smart consumers are switching away from consumer loans to residence mortgages, 
even if the money is used elsewhere, such as to buy a car. 
</P>
<P>
Although most homeowners deduct their residence mortgage interest, they often 
forget the hidden tax breaks. Here are the most frequently overlooked 
deductions: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Loan fees. When a new home mortgage is obtained or an existing loan is 
assumed by a home buyer, the lender often charges a loan fee. This charge is 
frequently called "points." One point equals 1% of the amount borrowed. For 
example, a one point loan fee to obtain a $100,000 mortgage is $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Loan fees paid to obtain a home loan qualify as deductible itemized interest in 
the year paid if the loan is used to buy or improve the owner's residence and 
if payment is made directly to the lender. The IRS says the loan fee must be 
paid by separate check to the lender rather than subtracted from the loan 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
However, IRS Revenue Ruling 86-68 says loan fees paid to refinance an existing 
mortgage are not immediately fully deductible and only can be deducted over the 
life of the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, if you pay a $1,000 fee to obtain a 30-year mortgage to 
refinance your existing home loan, you get a $33.33 annual interest deduction 
for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Special rules apply to FHA and VA loan costs. The origination fee paid by the 
borrower to obtain a VA home loan does not qualify as a deductible loan fee. 
But FHA loan discount charges paid by the borrower are now considered a 
deductible loan fee, if the FHA borrower pays the fee by separate check to the 
lender. 
</P>
<P>
However, home sellers who pay VA or FHA loan discount fees to the lender for 
the buyer can subtract such charges as a sales expense. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- An often overlooked real estate tax deduction occurs when a home buyer 
assumes or purchases subject to an existing mortgage such as an assumable FHA 
or VA loan. 
</P>
<P>
The mortgage interest for the month of acquisition is usually prorated between 
the buyer and seller by the escrow closing settlement agent. Buyers and sellers 
are entitled to deduct their share of the pro-rated interest, usually hundreds 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Many homeowners do not own the land on which their home is located and 
they pay ground rent to the landowner. This land rent is tax-deductible as 
itemized interest if the lease exceeds 15 years, including renewal periods, and 
is freely assignable; there is a present or future right to buy the land, and 
the landlord's interest in the land is primarily a security interest (like a 
mortgage). However, payments to buy the land are not deductible. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Real estate taxes qualify as itemized deductions in the year of payment. 
For example, many homeowners prepaid their property taxes to the local tax 
collector by the end of 1989 although they could have waited until 1990 to pay 
the tax. However, most tax collectors will not accept more than one year of 
prepaid property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to property tax deductions for local real estate taxes paid, if you 
bought a home or other real estate in 1989, don't forget to deduct your share 
of the pro-rated real estate tax even if it was actually paid by the seller. 
Each owner's pro-rated share of the property tax is deductible according to the 
number of days in the fiscal year the property was owned. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Millions of homeowners pay one-twelfth of their property taxes each month 
to their lender along with their mortgage payments. The escrow impound payments 
to the mortgage lender are not immediately deductible when paid, but they 
become deductible when the lender remits payment to the local tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the fire insurance portion of escrow impound payments is not 
deductible if the property is the owner's personal residence. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Most real estate sales involve various recording, title and transfer 
charges. These fees are not tax-deductible. However, if they were paid by the 
property buyer, they should be added to the buyer's cost basis for the 
property. If these charges were paid by the seller, they are sales expenses 
which should be subtracted from the gross sales price. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Any local property taxes and assessments are implemented for special 
purposes, such as new sidewalks, streets and sewers. These assessments, which 
benefit specific properties, are not deductible as real estate taxes. Instead, 
they should be capitalized and added to the property's adjusted cost basis.

<P>
Procrastinators, take note: The second installment of your annual property tax 
bill is due at the Los Angeles County Tax Collector's office by 5 p.m., April 
10. If you're mailing your bill, it must be postmarked by midnight of the same 
day to avoid a 10% penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra M. Davis, the Los Angeles County treasurer and tax collector, said the 
downtown branch of the tax collector's office -- at 225 N. Hill St. -- will be 
open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays through April 10. It will also be open 9 
a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Davis said taxpayers can get telephone assistance from 8 a.m. 
to 9 p.m. weekdays through April 10 by calling (213) 974-2111. He said property 
owners can call during off-peak hours for faster service. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers who haven't received a tax bill or have lost it can call the same 
number and leave a tape-recorded message. Davis said a substitute bill will be 
mailed within 24 hours.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions on what to do in the garden this 
week from the California Assn. of Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Let the kids join in on the fun of gardening. 
</P>
<P>
Quick results can be seen after planting such vegetables as radishes; it keeps 
the kids interested while waiting for other ones to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Check with a nurseryman about proper controls for the pests beginning to awaken 
from their winter nap in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
If the danger of frost is past in your area, you can plant fuchsias, 
pelargoniums and geraniums. 
</P>
<P>
Garden peas, snap peas and snow peas are easy to grow and a delight for the 
cook to use in all sorts of dishes.

KEEP YOUNGSTERS AMUSED, BUILD A GAZEBO SANDBOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLINGSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gazebos are still a trendy yard decoration, even though they're as old as 
gardening itself. Gracing the hills of Rome in the first century, gazebos are 
appearing more and more in contemporary gardens. 
</P>
<P>
A variation of the summerhouse, as gazebos are sometimes called, is our gazebo 
sandbox. Sure to bring joy to the whole family, it's a focal point for your 
garden and a shady place for children to play. 
</P>
<P>
Hexagon in shape, it measures 7 feet high and 5 feet wide. Choosing 
splinter-free finished lumber (fir is recommended), the sandbox sides are 
assembled. 
</P>
<P>
Posts are next mounted with seat pieces fitting easily in the post slots. An 
apron is added as an optional feature to strengthen the seat; the bottom 
portion is left open so a lawn trimmer may be used. 
</P>
<P>
Redwood lath material is cut and fitted upon rafters forming the gazebo, which 
is then screwed down upon the posts. A materials list and a lumber shopping 
guide are included in the plan; as well as detailed step-by-step directions, 
photos and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain Kids Gazebo Sandbox, Plan 792, please send $5.50. Also available is 
our Patterns for Better Living catalogue, picturing over 700 woodworking and 
handicraft projects, $3.95. Prices include postage and handling. California 
residents, please add sales tax. Send check or money order to Steve Ellingson, 
c/o Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2383, Van Nuys, Calif. 91409-2383.

REMODELER'S DIARY: A TRACT HOUSE TRANSFORMATION: LOTS OF CREDIT DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BART EVERETT, Everett is a Times news editor assigned to computer support. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We never intended to remodel a house. I did a kitchen once and it was the Job 
From Hell. 
</P>
<P>
No, we bought this house in 1985, just to make do for a while. Then we would 
buy a proper place, one with enough room for my teen-age daughters to 
comfortably visit. I needed a study, and so did my wife, who is a lawyer. We 
had to have a guest bedroom, one that didn't double as a television/family 
room. Perhaps we would need a nursery. 
</P>
<P>
We had 1,170 square feet of three-bedroom, one-bath, 40-year-old tract home on 
a smallish lot. 
</P>
<P>
My wife, Cammie, had liked its looks from the outside, and she liked it being 
on a hilltop cul-de-sac. Another plus was the garage-top observation deck with 
a view of the ocean and Santa Monica Mountains. And we soon came to enjoy our 
Mar Vista neighborhood and our neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But we would move. We just had to keep looking. We needed four bedrooms plus a 
maid's room. A family room would be a bonus. We told our realtor that if he 
didn't find us the right house we were going to add on. 
</P>
<P>
But still hoping to avoid such an ordeal, we told our architect: "It's a good 
thing your contract has a cancellation clause, because we have a top-rate 
realtor working for us and we hope to exercise that clause." 
</P>
<P>
That was the second architect. The first one had done second-story plans for 
two of the houses in our cul-de-sac. He worked on a plan-for-fee basis. 
</P>
<P>
For $750 he sketched for us two second-story ideas, one more elaborate than the 
other, both involving a stairway tucked against the front of the house, 
parallel to the street. The aim, at our behest, was maximum space for the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Then we met Barbara Coffman, an architect who was supervising a remodel a few 
streets away. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara dazzled us with a visit to this house, charmed us with her enthusiasm 
and convinced us that expansiveness and economy could co-exist. She liked to 
work a project from beginning to end, she said, but could set a fixed fee based 
on total estimated project value. We signed on the dotted line, expecting to 
spend maybe $120,000 on our second story. 
</P>
<P>
Ha! The total would be almost double that. 
</P>
<P>
I had determined that we did not want a stairway "tucked into" the house. Also, 
the front door could not open into the living room. It had to have its own 
room, unless it shared a room with the stairway. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. The kitchen had to have lots of cabinets and counter space. How 
did people live without pantries? 
</P>
<P>
We met with Barbara weekly and communicated in sketches and scale drawings. She 
built a cardboard model and revised it regularly. She asked about our 
interests, hobbies and concerns early on, searching for a motif, a style for 
our house. 
</P>
<P>
We like lots of light, we said; we like the outdoors, and we have a lot of 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, we solicited bids for a plan far beyond our initial limits, but 
even so we were not at all prepared for what came back. The bids were 
clustered, all out of reach, way beyond our resources. 
</P>
<P>
We listened to sales pitches for contracts we knew we could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
We had envisioned a dream, drawn pictures of it, made a model. But there was no 
way we could pay for it. "We'll get more bids, lots of bids," Barbara said. 
</P>
<P>
One contractor said the plans were "all wrong" and wanted to redraw the plans 
to "fit the budget" and "make better use of space." 
</P>
<P>
There was talk of performance guarantees and bonds, completion insurance, 
escrow accounts and iron-clad contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Several tradesmen wanted to supervise for a salary, with me acting as 
owner-contractor. One highly recommended contractor refused to bid. We never 
knew why. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was a guy who proposed a one-page contract that set forth a payment 
schedule and said he would build the house according to the plans. His bid was 
within reach, but the payments seemed bunched up too early. One former client 
had nothing but praise for him; another had canceled his contract in a dispute. 
</P>
<P>
We interviewed the contractor at length. He had said before bidding that his 
price would be the lowest. Had he forgotten anything? No. We wanted 
five-eighth-inch dry wall, as specified. OK. Electrical conduit? Sure. No 
problem reconstructing the hardwood floors? Nope. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the payments seem weighted toward the early construction phases? That's 
the way he always does it. Is he insured? Does he carry workmen's compensation? 
Oh, yes. You have to. 
</P>
<P>
What would happen, we wondered, if this one-man construction company named 
Richard George fell ill or was injured? We put thoughts like that out of our 
mind and signed him up. 
</P>
<P>
We moved into an apartment near the house, keeping it as our mailing address 
and leaving a phone line installed for Richard. 
</P>
<P>
Although some people had advised us to stay away from the job site -- don't 
meddle and avoid the aggravation -- we never once regretted staying in close 
touch. Morning visits with Richard and his subcontractors became a ritual. It 
seemed that every day there was a question to be answered or a problem to be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
"Does Barbara really want that window up at 90 inches?" Richard would ask. 
Sometimes I knew the answer, other times I had to check with Barbara. Sometimes 
Richard would call her and she would check with me. 
</P>
<P>
We shopped for Richard. We ordered bathtubs, sinks, countertops, cabinets -- 
$30,000 worth of kitchen and bathroom supplies. One day I bought $700 worth of 
door knobs at a discount warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
We selected tile and marble where the installers did business and shopped for 
wallpaper and light fixtures all over town. Our counselors were our craftsmen: 
a carpenter, a painter, the marble man, the tile man, the electrician and 
Richard himself. 
</P>
<P>
Richard's contract included telephone outlets but not doubled television 
cabling or an alarm system. I found a contractor who did all three and figured 
out a fair way to charge Richard for his share. I had phone and television 
jacks put everywhere, as I had done with electrical outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Cammie thought I was crazy. But now you can plug in a phone or a television 
anywhere. You can have a cable decoder for every television or use a central 
decoder; a very good buy at $21 a box, even Cammie now agrees. 
</P>
<P>
A friend talked me into stringing speaker wire while the walls were still open. 
Now we have six pairs of speakers on three sound systems. But there is no 
speaker wire under carpets or behind chairs, just as there is not a single 
extension cord in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I think that if we had thought of everything and correctly analyzed 
the costs, we would not have attempted the remodel. For example, we deferred 
thoughts of "floor coverings," but these ended up a major expense. 
</P>
<P>
While Richard refinished the lower hardwood floor and put tile in the bathrooms 
and kitchen, his contract did not cover the $7,000 oak stairway (installed over 
the rough stairway) or the $3,000 marble entry, let alone carpeting and wood 
parquet on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
And we should have known that working on a house almost always is hard on the 
surrounding flora. Re-landscaping cost around $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
We were mindful all along that we would have to pay extra for kitchen 
appliances, but we didn't realize how irresistible the higher priced items 
would be. Who would put a cheap oven in that wonderful new kitchen? Pay $2,400 
and get something nice. 
</P>
<P>
Richard isn't quite finished. There's just a bit of painting to go and one or 
two little things to figure out -- like what to put between the carpet and the 
exposed stove pipe that runs through the loft. But we're in and we like it. 
</P>
<P>
The place is light and airy and we see a lot of the outdoors. The stairway 
holds hundreds of books, and the view is a lot better than from atop the 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
If this had been a major motion picture instead of a house, the credits would 
be extensive.

INTERIORS: DESIGN INDUSTRY IS STUCK IN A HOLDING PATTERN; 
</P>
<P>
WESTWEEK: INNOVATIVE IDEAS OF THE PAST ARE BEING ABSORBED AND REFINED BY 
DESIGNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles free-lancer who writes on 
architectural topics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 15 years, Westweek, the annual designers' festival sponsored by the Pacific 
Design Center in late March, has mounted a mixture of displays, exhibits and 
discussion panels intended as a showcase for current trends in the busy West 
Coast market. 
</P>
<P>
Although not open to the public, Westweek provides an overview of the range of 
interior design products, from chairs to fabrics, that populate showrooms 
across the United States and abroad, and a foretaste of new items you might 
expect to see in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Westweek, attended by about 30,000 visitors, confirmed that the 
design industry is in a holding pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The hectic innovations of the last decade, during which Postmodernism developed 
as a third-track parallel to the standard Modernism and established 
Traditionalism that have long been the interior designers' stock-in-trade, are 
in the process of being thoroughly absorbed and refined. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is this situation more clearly reflected than in the range of chair 
designs on display at the PDC. Chairs -- those most basic items of furniture -- 
allow designers a lot of freedom to experiment with radical ideas or try new 
variations on ancient forms. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollis and the Fino, two chairs featured in the Brayton collection offered 
by Brayton International of High Point, N.C., are interesting examples of the 
Postmodern style. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollis armchair, with its plump, round, upholstered back and base and 
inserted seat is, like many Postmodern designs, a simplified form of a 
traditional shape. Comfortable yet elegant, it avoids the urge to make a 
"statement" that distorts the proportions of much Postmodern furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The Fino is a nervy, classical, square-sided beechwood chair with slightly 
splayed legs. The tops of the unified back and sides curve delicately outward 
as if to welcome you to dignified rest. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, these chairs and their matching settees, for once, validate the 
common claim to "timelessness." 
</P>
<P>
A punk version of Postmodern is presented by the Hopper range of chairs, from 
New York City's Kinetics Furniture Inc. Created by the MDZ Design Studio, the 
chairs, archly named "Hippity," "Hoppy" and "Skippy," mix wood, metal, leather 
and jazzy fabrics in designs that resemble buzzing insects ready to leap around 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
In the high-tech Modernist category, the Sulky, manufactured in the United 
States for the Swiss-based Sitag Co., is a marvel of ingenuity that also 
manages to be supremely comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Designed mainly for office use, the Sulky has a skillfully engineered chassis 
that allows the seat and the back to adjust in concert to the sitter's shape. 
</P>
<P>
The chairs avoid the overwrought ejector-seat look that makes so many current 
high-tech office chairs slightly repellent, and the Sulky's price range, 
between $400 and $700 per chair, is modest by today's inflated standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Ricchio, a traditional design by Knoll International inspired by fine 
19th-Century joinery in wood, is one of the better examples of a simple and 
ancient chair form adapted to the contemporary market. Designers Linda and 
Joseph Ricchio have refined the traditional model with subtly tapered legs and 
curving, slatted back that underscores the tensile strength of pear wood and 
mahogany. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the main exhibits and the discussion panels that accompanied the 1990 
Westweek reflected PDC President Richard Norfolk's statement: "We have decided 
to place a major emphasis on Los Angeles this year, underscoring our region's 
rising status in the international design scene." 
</P>
<P>
"On the Edge: Industrial Design in Southern California," an exhibit sponsored 
by Artemide, the avant-garde Italian lighting company, displayed a range of 
highly sophisticated manufactured objects whose design originated in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
These included the Mazda Miata sports car, designed in Mazda's Irvine studio; 
Apple Computer's futuristic Work Space 2000 office work station by Patton 
Design; Seiko Instruments experimental flat-screen color liquid crystal display 
computer monitor, designed by L.A.-based S.G. Hauser Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion panels continued Westweek's Los Angeles emphasis by involving a 
wide range of local architects, designers, art-scene leaders and public 
officials in forums that explored such topics as los Angeles' avant-garde, the 
cultural and financial forces shaping L.A. as an international metropolis, and 
"Who will make the design difference in L.A. in the next century?" 
</P>
<P>
The uneven nature of these panels, attended by large audiences, revealed both 
the need for such get-togethers in our all-too-fragmented metropolis and the 
frequent lack of coherence such Angeleno forums display. 
</P>
<P>
Panel participants, often lacking the habit of public discussion, tended to

Like Westweek as a whole, the panels add up to less than the sum of their 
parts. Perhaps the PDC, as a major local focus for design, should make Westweek 
more effective and more relevant to a wider audience by integrating its annual 
event into an ongoing program of exhibits and symposiums to which the public is 
invited.

SHOULD TRAVELING TRAINEE BUY OR RENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL, Campbell, a retired Times staff writer, now is a 
Phoenix-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
QUESTION: I have a new job with a promising future but I know that for several 
years 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
while I'm what you might call a trainee -- I'm going to be transferred every 
two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I think that our best bet is to go with an adjustable-rate mortgage 
for our first home because of the lower interest rate for the first year or 
two, although we prefer a fixed-rate mortgage. Does this seem like a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Choosing an ARM (adjustable-rate mortgage) is a good idea for the very 
reason you mention -- the lower initial rate. 
</P>
<P>
What might be an even better idea, though, is to scuttle the whole idea of home 
ownership until your life settles down. There are times when it makes much more 
sense to remain a renter. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, the odds on your coming out ahead, financially, having to buy, 
sell, pack up, move, unpack, buy, sell and pack up again every two or three 
years are so slim as to be invisible. 
</P>
<P>
Even if your luck turns out to be blessed and you move from one good market to 
another good market -- showing a slight appreciation in your house each time -- 
you'll need fantastic luck to break even. 
</P>
<P>
I would squirrel away my money and play the landlord-tenant game until my 
employer lets me put down roots someplace. 
</P>
<P>
Advantages When a Seller Holds Mortgage 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the advantages to sellers who carry back mortgages for the buyer? 
</P>
<P>
A: The primary benefit is that offering to carry back a second mortgage may 
very well spell the difference between selling and not selling a home in a 
less-than-spirited market. 
</P>
<P>
If you've got a credit-worthy would-be buyer who is shy of the 20% down payment 
that conventional lenders require, it makes perfectly good sense to carry back 
a part of that difference yourself rather than lose the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The interest that you'll receive will normally be slightly better than the 
interest on CDs or similar investments. A local title company can handle the 
paper work and the risk is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Carry the whole thing, yourself? There's a lot to be said for that, too, 
although more safeguards will be needed -- such as a more stringent credit 
check, private mortgage insurance and a lawyer on hand in the event that 
foreclosure becomes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But, again -- if you don't need the money out of the house in a lump sum -- the 
yield on your equity is above market and the risk is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
He Wants to Sell Half of Duplex as Condo 
</P>
<P>
Q: I want to consider selling half my double (duplex) residence as a 
condominium. Will you please send me information that I will need to properly 
judge the pros and cons? 
</P>
<P>
A: Technically, according to the Community Associations Institute -- the 
nonprofit organization representing homeowners' associations in the 
condominium, co-operative and townhouse fields -- there's no minimum number of 
units that can be included under the condominium form of ownership. But the 
question is, just how practical is it? 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, two- and four-unit condominiums scattered around, largely 
in resort areas, according to the CAI's Judy Foster, but she could recall no 
case where the owner of a duplex went this route. 
</P>
<P>
You've got to remember that there are a number of legal steps involved here -- 
getting incorporated, for openers -- and so your best bet is to query the state 
real estate board to find out what sort of licensing requirements are called 
for. 
</P>
<P>
All sorts of questions revolving around practicality come to mind: You're 
talking about a two-member homeowners' association, for one thing, which means 
that it would be an impossibility to get a majority vote on any needed 
improvements to the property unless the two of you are in complete accord. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Foster adds, a six-unit condo is normally considered the 
smallest practical size and the two-unit projects she is familiar with are not 
owner occupied. 
</P>
<P>
But if you write her, explaining in more detail exactly what you have in mind, 
she'll pass it on to the CAI's legal staff for further research. Address your 
letter to Judy Foster, Community Associations Institute, 1423 Powhatan St., 
Suite 7, Alexandria, Va. 22314.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: 'POWER CENTERS' MUSCLE WAY INTO SALES VOLUME; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: NEW TYPE OF SHOPPING CENTERS OUTPERFORM SALES OF RETAIL MALLS. THEY ARE 
CROPPING UP WHEREVER LAND IS RELATIVELY CHEAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN, Galperin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've all heard of power windows, power tools and power lunches. Now, yet 
another new concept is about to make its way into our language -- "power 
centers." 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about giant "concrete boxes," as their developers call them, 
clustered together to create a new type of shopping center -- the power center 
-- which rings up four times the sales volume of comparably sized regional 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
These new centers have as anchors tenants so-called "category killers" -- 
national retailers that have emerged to capture a sizable chunk of sales in a 
particular category of merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
HomeClub, Home Depot, Costco, Price Club, Circuit City, Toys R Us and 
OfficeClub are just a few examples of category killers. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, one of the biggest category killers, Wal-Mart, is about to open 
its first California store this summer at the Valley Central power center in 
Lancaster. And Wal-Mart plans another 200 stores in California as it embarks on 
what competitors say is an invasion of the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Power centers are bringing millions of dollars in sales tax revenue to 
communities such as Puente Hills, Lancaster, Oxnard and Victorville. Several 
others have been proposed in the Inland Empire, Carmel Ranch near San Diego and 
south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The power centers are stealing retail business from everyone else," said 
developer Malcolm Riley. "Their sales volume is gigantic." 
</P>
<P>
His Brentwood-based company, Riley/Pearlman Co., is completing Valley Central 
-- a 75-acre power center anchored by HomeClub and Costco. 
</P>
<P>
While these retailers and their mega-stores may seem less than glamorous, they 
cost less to build than a department store, take up less space and they 
generate more sales per square foot than just about any traditional May Co., 
Broadway, Bullock's or even Nordstrom store. How do they do it? Discount prices 
and volume shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
"They've really revolutionized value buying for the consumer," said development 
consultant Larry Kosmont. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these big-box tenants, he reports, generate $300 to $500 a square foot 
in annual sales. Some even ring up as much as $1,000 a square foot in sales. 
Compare that to department stores in an enclosed mall where $200 a square foot 
in annual sales is relatively common. 
</P>
<P>
Category killers are destination tenants with "premeditated customers," said 
retail developer and consultant Steven Soboroff of Soboroff/Moskowitz Co. in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
While the malls continue to draw recreational shoppers, it's the power centers 
that attract customers who know what they want, want it fast, and want it 
cheap, Soboroff said. 
</P>
<P>
"Category killers are the guys making the loot in retail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ingredients to power center success, he added, are lots of outdoor parking, 
big signs, freeway access, a good mix of discount retailers and, of course, 
cheap land to accommodate these industrial-like centers with tilt-up concrete 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
Another important element to success is persuading buyers that they're getting 
a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of retail is psychological -- where you think you're saving money," 
said Thomas R. Ryan, president of Ryan/Kalof Commercial Real Estate Inc. in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
And, he warned, "I don't know whether five years from now people will still get 
their kick out of shopping at a power center." Novelty and caprice also created 
the now-maligned mini-mall, noted Ryan, and as far as power centers are 
concerned, "the jury is still out." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to have a tough time," predicted Jack Kyser, chief 
economist for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "It's my feeling that 
these centers may be more hype than reality." 
</P>
<P>
"They're all singing a pretty little song," said Kyser of power center 
developers. They still need, however, to prove that they can keep the cash 
registers ringing over the long-term, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a myth that regional malls with department store tenants are dead," 
said Kyser. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while retailers suffer through a shakeout typified by the bankruptcy filing 
of Campeau Corp., Southern California's regional malls are performing quite 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Expansions are planned at malls in Riverside, West Los Angeles and Glendale. 
New regional malls are on the drawing boards for Culver City, Fairfax, Porter 
Ranch, Rancho Cucamonga, Santa Clarita, Burbank, Santa Barbara, Oxnard and the 
Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Then too, Broadway is expanding into Santa Barbara while May Co. stretches into 
Santa Maria and Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
All this activity, Kyser said, suggests that traditional retailers plan to give 
power tenants and their developers a run for their money. 
</P>
<P>
What many retail merchants and developers have forgotten, said Soboroff, is 
that you don't have to be big to be powerful. Small centers too can attract a 
national "power tenant." and create a small-scale power center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in these tough times for retailers, Soboroff said, "anybody can create a 
powerful shopping center with the right tenant mix." The trouble is, he said, 
"most people just don't take the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developments 
</P>
<P>
SDC Development of Newport Beach started construction at Inland Distribution 
Center, a 42-acre industrial project in Fontana. The $40-million project 
includes five manufacturing/distribution buildings at the southeast corner of 
Slover and Etiwanda avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific Realty started construction on the $18-million, two-building 
first phase of its new 47-acre industrial park in Fullerton. The distribution 
and manufacturing facilities are being built on 13 acres adjacent to Fullerton 
Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leases 
</P>
<P>
Law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft signed a $23-million, 15-year lease 
with Ahmanson Commercial Development Co. for three floors in the Home Savings 
of America Tower at the northeast corner of 7th and Figueroa streets in 
downtown Los Angeles. The firm plans to move its Los Angeles office from 
California Plaza in September. The firm was represented in lease negotiations 
by Reliance Development Group Inc. and Cushman Realty Crop. Ahmanson 
represented itself. 
</P>
<P>
Logicon Inc. signed a 12 1/2-year lease for 74,000 square feet at Plaza La 
Reina near Los Angeles International Airport for more than $14 million. Julien 
J. Studley Inc. represented owners Borstein Enterprises and Metropolitan Life 
Insurance in lease transactions. Cushman Realty Corp. and Commercial Industrial 
Associates represented Logicon. 
</P>
<P>
Chadbourne &amp; Parke plans to relocate its law offices from 444 S. Flower St. 
to the soon-to-be-completed Figueroa at Wilshire building as part of a 10-year 
lease for 30,000 square feet, valued at about $10 million. The firm will 
initially occupy 20,000 square feet on the 16th floor, with a later expansion 
onto the 17th floor scheduled. Owner Mitsui Fudosan (U.S.A.) Inc. was 
represented in lease transactions by fee developer Gerald D. Hines Interests. 
Julien J. Studley Inc. represented the tenant.

GIVE YOUR HOME A LIGHT TOUCH ALL OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Good lighting has emotional as well as physical rewards, according to an 
article in House Beautiful, and there are many ways you can upgrade your 
lighting with a minimum of fuss or expense, says the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen: If kitchen lighting is not directly over work surfaces, you're 
probably standing in your own shadow. If the room has one central ceiling 
fixture, you probably never have sufficient light on any work or cooking area. 
Here are some options: 
</P>
<P>
Track lighting may be the easiest remedy; you can install it yourself. Placed 
directly over the edge of counters, it will provide essential task light for 
cooking and cutting surfaces. If you have an island work center, you can 
connect adapters to the track and mount hanging fixtures directly overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Under-cabinet lighting, either incandescent or fluorescent, is another option. 
Incandescent can be easily and inexpensively dimmed. Always mount under-cabinet 
lighting as far forward as possible, away from the back wall, so light is 
focused directly on your work rather than behind it. 
</P>
<P>
Consider over-cabinet lighting, if your ceiling is high enough. You can install 
individual fixtures or continuous lighting strips -- incandescent, fluorescent 
or halogen. 
</P>
<P>
Halogens offer white light and longer lasting bulbs, but will usually require a 
transformer for household use. 
</P>
<P>
Build a cove or soffit around the upper reaches of your room and install small 
continuous-lighting sources that will provide up-light, which bounces off the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Standard recessed fixtures are available that don't require ceiling demolition 
or special installation. They are called "install from below" or "old-work 
housing." The only problem may be feeding in the necessary wiring. Check with 
your electrician. 
</P>
<P>
Dining room: If your dining room is like most others, it is lit by a single 
chandelier, placed dead center. If the dining table must share the room with a 
china cabinet or sideboard, chances are it is off-center from the chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
Consider replacing it with surface-mounted or recessed ceiling fixtures. Or you 
can install several semi-recessed fixtures arranged in a square, circle or 
triangle pattern over the table. 
</P>
<P>
Another option is to mount sconces on either side of French or sliding doors, a 
china cabinet, an important painting or a doorway leading to another room. 
</P>
<P>
Living room: In addition to table and floor lamps, consider adding up-lights 
that sit discreetly on the floor to light dark corners, highlight plants or 
create a warm glow behind a chair or table. Installing opaque shades on 
traditional lamps will cut glare without seriously reducing overall light. 
</P>
<P>
In rooms with high or cathedral ceilings, try adding up-light wall sconces or 
floor lamps. 
</P>
<P>
Bathroom: The best way to light a bathroom mirror is by mounting one or more 
incandescent fixtures on the same wall as the mirror. If your present fixture 
is in the ceiling right over the vanity, you're getting a distorted mirror 
image with strong, unnatural shadows under your eyebrows and chin. 
</P>
<P>
Bedroom: Unless your bedroom also is your dressing area, general illumination 
may be less important than mood lighting, which can be achieved with up-lights 
or strategically placed table and floor lamps. 
</P>
<P>
Bedside light should be amiable, so you can adjust it to suit any reading 
position, and highly focused, so neither spouse is disturbed if the other stays 
up late to read.

THE TASTE OF TRAVEL: BELGIANS BREW UP SOME SUDS IN DIFFERENT STYLES

BRUSSELS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Belgium, a glass of beer can be enjoyed much as one might savor a Bordeaux 
in France. 
</P>
<P>
Each brew, it seems -- from the tawny Duvel to the rich earthiness of Chimay -- 
offers its own special character. In cafes, the beers are served in 
wide-mouthed glasses, allowing drinkers to appreciate the liquid's various 
"noses," which are sometimes floral, sometimes hoppy and, in the case of the 
unusual framboise and kriek brews, redolent of raspberry and cherry. 
</P>
<P>
For Belgians at least, their beers share a further trait in common with wine -- 
they are often enjoyed as an accompaniment to contemplation and lofty 
discussion. Unlike the noise of English pubs or German beer halls, Belgian 
cafes are fairly quiet places. 
</P>
<P>
"Our beers are what I call 'meditative,' " says Jean Pierre Van Roy, owner of 
Cantillon, the last surviving brasserie in Brussels' city center. "Brewing is 
an art like the making of wine, and to drink a beer is to meditate on the sun 
and other things." 
</P>
<P>
Belgium's relatively small size (population of 9.9 million) and the limited 
production of its breweries have helped to keep Belgian beers very much a 
secret among those familiar with British ales and German lagers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the country is home to l00 active breweries, many of them 
centuries old, which produce over 400 separate beer labels. Some, like Stella 
Artois and Jupiler, are typical lagers, hardly distinguishable from Miller or 
Budweiser. The majority, however, are brands produced by the highly unusual 
Belgian brewing tradition, and their complexity of flavors and range of styles 
draw frequent comparisons to wine. 
</P>
<P>
Major Belgian beer labels such as Duvel, Chimay, Orval and Corsendonk are 
available in specialty liquor stores in the United States. To guage their true 
variety, though, one must travel to Brussels, the Belgian capital, or such 
cities as Brugge and Ghent in Flanders. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, a visitor could travel from cafe to cafe for a long while before 
having to repeat an order. Such cafe-hopping, however, must be approached with 
care. Belgian beers are frequently much stronger in alcohol content than 
American brews. 
</P>
<P>
Duvel -- the name means devil in Flemish -- appears more like a typical beer 
than most Belgians with its tawny color and creamy head, but behind the 
disguise lies a heady 8.2% beer (American beers commonly contain half that 
alcohol strength). Belgium's strongest is the 12% Bush beer. 
</P>
<P>
While they are characteristically an unpatriotic lot -- Belgians freely admit 
this and it is perhaps one reason why the European Community has chosen 
Brussels as its administrative capital and chief rendezvous point for its 12 
member nations -- the people are nevertheless quite proud of their beers and 
brewing traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Those traditions can be traced to the country's monasteries, where brewing was 
among the monks' peaceful industries. Today, distinctive ales are still 
produced at five Belgian monastaries: Chimay, Orval, Rochefort, Westmalle and 
Westvleteren. So-called abbaye beers, such as Corsendonk, are brewed according 
to monks' recipes but by licensed commercial brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Chimay's master brewer, Brother Theodore, is something of a living legend in 
Belgium. He has faithfully maintained the tradition of ale brewing, but has 
also been an innovator. He created Chimay's Cinq Cents brew to commemorate the 
recent 500th anniversary of the principality of Chimay, in the southern Hainaut 
region, part of French-speaking Wallonia. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, only in Belgium is beer still brewed as it was in the Middle Ages 
before the discovery of yeasts. Such lambic beers are spontaneously fermented 
by atmospheric yeasts and other microflora. A straight lambic has little 
carbonation and, for beer, an unexpected sourness. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit flavors are often added, resulting in the raspberry-flavored framboise 
and cherry-flavored kriek beers. Less common are cassis and peach-flavored 
lambics. Gueuze beers are a blend of young and old lambic beers, which results 
in a sweeter beer. The difference is not unlike that of a single malt whiskey 
and a blend. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, where dozens of breweries once flourished as they did in cities 
across Belgium, the last suviving traditional brasserie is the century-old 
Cantillon at 56 Rue Gheude. Owner and master brewer Jean Pierre Van Roy has 
opened a Gueuze Museum (Musee Bruxellos de la Gueuze), and groups and 
individuals may tour the brewing operation from mid-October to the end of 
April, every Saturday from l0 a.m. to 5 p.m. or during the week by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum is a way to preserve and promote artisanal lambic beers and to 
protect their quality and reputation," Van Roy said. "It is very much a living 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
In a rooftop fermenting room, an enormous vat lies open. The tiles of the roof 
are arranged so that air can pass through, admitting the atmospheric yeasts. 
According to Van Roy, slight differences in atmospheric composition yield 
different tastes in the resulting lambics and gueuzes. The warm winters of 
recent years, for example, have had a softening effect on the beers. 
</P>
<P>
The Cantillon brewery, a family operation whose staff includes Van Roy's wife 
and son, produces limited quantities of lambics, gueuze and framboise beers. 
All are aged for some amount of time, the lambics for up to three years. The 
beers are bottled in what look like wine bottles, and are even corked like 
wine. A tour ends with a tasting session. 
</P>
<P>
In Brugge, a visitor will find the intricacies of Belgian beers explained in 
seminars conducted for groups regularly at the Beer Academy (Kemelstraat 5). 
Pub owner Jan De Bruyne covers not only the various kinds of Belgian beers, but 
also what foods are best served with them. In the main room of the pub, De 
Bruyne offers more than 300 Belgian beers for sale. Many of these are aged up 
to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a Budweiser would never last that long, but Belgian beers -- such as 
the rich and slightly sour Rodenbach, called the "Burgundy of Belgium" for its 
red color, attain unusual, port-like complexities in the aging process. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this century, 31 breweries made their home in Brugge. 
Today, only two are still operating. 
</P>
<P>
De Gouden Boom (The Golden Tree) opened in 1872 and is now managed by Paul 
Vanneste, a fourth-generation brewer. On a tour of De Gouden Boom, the thin 
Lincolnesque figure of Vanneste, who stands over 6 feet 6 inches tall, bends to 
pass under pipes carrying Brugs tarwebier (in French, "Blanche de Bruges," a 
wheat or "white" beer, another Belgian specialty brew known for its slightly 
tart, fruity flavors). 
</P>
<P>
Along with Brugs tarwebier, De Goudon Boom also brews a strong abbaye ale and a 
thick, creamy Brugse Tripel, which packs a 9.5% alcoholic punch. Close by the 
brewery on Langestraat, 't Paardje Restaurant (The Little Horse) serves 
steaming buckets of mussels cooked in Brugs tarwebier -- an almost irresistible 
combination best washed down with draft Brugs tarweiber. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the French, who defend their country's wines almost as staunchly as they 
would their own homes, the Belgians appear a bit lackadaisical when it comes to 
promoting their brewing heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, as 1992 and the creation of a European super-market approaches, there is 
some concern that only the very biggest breweries in Belgium will withstand the 
competitive onslaught that can be expected from English, German and Dutch 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Small, artisanal brewers like Cantillon's Van Roy and De Gouden Boom's Vanneste 
fear that they may be swallowed up in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"I am anxious that the big breweries will take over the smaller ones," Vanneste 
says. "If that happens, the tradition we have preserved here may be lost." 
</P>

SOMETHING DELIGHTFUL IS BREWING IN BELGIUM RESTAURANTS

BRUSSELS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In bilingual Brussels, where the Flemish and Francophone cultures coincide and 
sometimes collide, cafes do double duty. 
</P>
<P>
Many are very much in the French style, offering espresso and light meals; 
others are more like pubs or taverns, and the lists of beers served there -- 
Belgian and otherwise -- can go on for pages. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, one does not exclude the other. At a typical Brussels cafe, 
beer and coffee frequently appear at the same table. 
</P>
<P>
For most travelers, a visit to Brussels begins at the Grand Place in the center 
of downtown. A cobblestone square used as an open-air flower market is flanked 
on all sides by striking examples of Gothic and Baroque architecture, with much 
of the latter highlighted in gold leaf. 
</P>
<P>
The l5th-Century Hotel de Ville dominates, its dark visage a contrast to the 
lighter, more confectionary style of the surrounding buildings. On the far 
left, facing the Hotel de Ville, is the home of the Brewer's Guild, which is 
now, appropriately, a beer museum operated by the Belgian Brewers 
Confederation. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Place is lined with cafes, which in warmer months is filled with 
patrons enjoying the outdoor ambience. The most prominent of these is Au Roy 
d'Espagne. From a second-floor window seat there, the entire Grand Place is on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
North of the Grand Place lies the narrow, restaurant-lined Rue des Bouchers. 
Tight corridors branch off the Rue des Bouchers and lead to inner layers of 
even more restaurants and cafes. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Brussels was built like a checkerboard, with each square's exterior 
walls concealing a courtyard. As the city grew, it didn't spread out, but 
rather filled in. Thus, the inner layer of buildings is younger than those on 
the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Down one such corridor is Toone, at Impasse Schuddeveld. Toone's beer list is 
one of the longest, and includes several Cantillon brews. In winter, the dark, 
wood-paneled old tavern is warmed by a large fireplace. At night, Toone doubles 
as a theater; in a back room, marionette plays are performed as they have been 
for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
A walk through the shop-lined arcade of Galeries St. Hubert, which begins just 
outside Grand Place, leads to La Mort Subite on Rue Montagne-aux-Herbes 
Potageres. This cafe doubles as the home of the Mort Subite lambic beers, 
including framboise and kriek. 
</P>
<P>
La Mort Subite is literally translated as "sudden death," not because of any 
fatal associations with its beers but because dice players on lunch hour at the 
cafe would switch to "sudden death" to determine a winner before returning to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
A great hall of a cafe, the ceiling supported by gilded Corinthian columns, 
Mort Subite has long been popular with Brussels' students. 
</P>
<P>
Farther out from the center of downtown, past the Parc du Jardin Botanique and 
its crystal palace greenhouses, lies De Ultieme Hallucinatie, at 316 Rue 
Royale. 
</P>
<P>
The well-preserved art nouveau interior leads to an outdoor garden cafe. On a 
warm afternoon, a salad with a Cantillon gueuze makes a refreshing lunch. 
</P>
<P>
And Hallucinatie's Flemish-speaking crowd reminds one that Brussels is very 
much a bilingual city. Any order, however, whether for Cantillon or Corsendonk, 
can be given in English. CHRISTOPHER KENNEALLY

POINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Half a dozen turkey vultures are doing lazy loops overhead, eyeing the hilly 
Northern California countryside for a quick meal, as we follow silently behind 
our guide. 
</P>
<P>
It's a bright, sunny afternoon with only the slightest whisper of a breeze. The 
calmness, however, contrasts sharply with the jumbled and disordered terrain, 
which was once the scene of epic violence -- not of the human sort, but by the 
hand of nature -- and will surely be again. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the vultures, a visitor wonders whether these birds of prey sense the 
danger underneath them. But these reveries are disrupted by our guide. 
</P>
<P>
"And here," the guide announces cheerfully (too cheerfully, the visitor 
thinks), "you see where the earth cracked open." 
</P>
<P>
He points to a row of blue wooden posts on a grassy rise dead ahead. 
</P>
<P>
We were walking over a particularly memorable part of the San Andreas fault, 
the great geological scar that slashes like a dagger through much of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In the early morning hours of April 18, 1906, the ground first ripped apart 
near here, unleashing the horrible events that virtually destroyed San 
Francisco some 50 miles away (as the crow, not the vulture, flies). 
</P>
<P>
About three dozen of us, of all ages, have joined our guide to walk the 
Earthquake Trail, a living textbook in seismology created by the National Park 
Service to provide some lessons about quakes, as well as to debunk the myths 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
The trail, only seven-tenths of a mile long in the very heart of the 1906 fault 
zone, is one of the less well-known delights of the Point Reyes National 
Seashore, a great natural wonderland of wildlife and scenic vistas overlooking 
the Pacific that attracts some 2.2 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
Most come for such pleasures as watching the powerful surf crash onto the miles 
of beaches, or viewing the annual migration of gray whales from a famed 
century-old lighthouse atop brooding headlands, or hiking along the park's 
thickly wooded ridges and ravines. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Point Reyes peninsula, hooking out into the Pacific like a long-noised 
gargoyle on a medieval cathedral, has another distinction. It sits on the 
eastern edge of a portion of the earth's crust known as the Pacific plate, 
whereas most of California, along with the rest of the United States, occupy 
the North American plate. 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas fault, running along the eastern edge of the peninsula, marks 
the boundary between the two plates. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you can have one foot in North America and the other is Asia," says our 
guide with slight exaggeration as he playfully straddles the path with his legs 
far apart. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the fault zone isn't a single, narrow crack, but a fractured 
landscape of ridges, small hills and rolling meadows hundreds of yards wide. 
But in one way, he's right. Geologically, Point Reyes isn't really part of 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
As we followed the Earthquake Trail's meanderings through the fault zone, we 
passed by old, moss-covered trees, some of them still tilted from the 1906 
shake. We paused at a meadow where the park service raises big, friendly Morgan 
horses. Then we strolled along a weathered scrap that still shows where the two 
plates moved past each other. 
</P>
<P>
There was no need for hammer and pick on this field trip; we were getting our 
geology effortlessly. The gentle path had been paved, and signs along the way 
explained the earthquake phenomenon in words, diagrams and old photos, e.g., an 
old steam locomotive tossed on its side by the 1906 jolt. 
</P>
<P>
They even provide safety tips on what to do when the earth starts shaking while 
you're at home (stand in a doorway, turn off electrical and gas lines), though, 
disturbingly, none for while you're walking along a major fault. 
</P>
<P>
The trail is open to walkers free of charge year-round, as is the rest of the 
seashore. It begins just a few steps from the seashore's Bear Valley Visitors 
Center, a splendid little natural history museum about the rich flora and fauna 
of Point Reyes, off Route 1, near the town of Olema. 
</P>
<P>
Although walkers can take the trail on their own at any time, on this day, as 
on every Sunday at 2 p.m., the National Park Service provides one of its 
ranger-naturalists as an instructional guide. 
</P>
<P>
After last October's Loma Prieta quake that shook the Bay Area, traffic on the 
trail picked up in a sudden burst of public seismic awareness, even though 
Point Reyes escaped the earth's angry wrath. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the rugged landscape along this section of the San Andreas fault is as 
good as any for learning how a quake can reshape terra (not so) firma. 
</P>
<P>
Our leader was an affable young Georgian, Ed Amerson, who admitted he was not a 
seismologist but had plainly done his homework. 
</P>
<P>
He told us that geologists, in jest, refer to Point Reyes as "an island in 
time" because it will eventually break free from California and became an 
island. "But don't worry," he added. "That won't happen for another five 
million years." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't millinerian science fiction, Amerson assured us. It's a fact of 
plate tectonics, geology's new orthodoxy, which holds that the earth's surface 
is composed of a half-dozen continent-sized plates, as well as a number of 
smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
They move constantly, bumping and grinding against each other and slowly 
changing the planet's face, as well as creating spectacular geological 
curiosities like Point Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, geologists wondered why the bedrock of Point Reyes was 
essentially hard granite, while just across the fault was softer, pulverized 
stuff called Franciscan sediment. Now, thanks to plate tectonics, says Amerson, 
they know why. 
</P>
<P>
Point Reyes once was part of the Sierra Nevada, east of Los Angeles, but as the 
Pacific plate slid past and under the North American plate, it ripped Point 
Reyes away from its mountainous granitic birthplace and, in the past 150 
million years, carried it 350 miles north, like a parcel on a conveyer belt. 
</P>
<P>
This slow-motion journey, as the tossed landscape shows, wasn't smooth, 
however. It progressed in fits and starts, accompanied by earthquakes. In the 
big one of 1906, Point Reyes lurched northwestward about 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the tutor, Amerson whipped out two little kitchen sponges to demonstrate 
the plate action. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's imagine one of them as the Pacific plate and the other as the North 
American," he said as he brought the edges of the sponges firmly together. 
</P>
<P>
"The plates have bumped, just like these sponges. Normally, they're supposed to 
slide smoothly past each other, the North American plate moving in a westerly 
direction and the Pacific toward the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
"But here, along this part of the fault, they've snagged, warping the rock as 
the strain builds from the pressure of the plate movements." 
</P>
<P>
As he demonstrated with the sponges, you could see them bend and swell, storing 
up the energy from the force he exerted on them. 
</P>
<P>
Then -- snap! He suddenly let the sponges break free. The effect was so 
artfully timed that some of the visitors gasped. 
</P>
<P>
"When the rock has stored its maximum energy," he says, "the earth cracks, 
right along the plate boundary, and the ground on each side of the fault 
lurches in opposite directions to relieve the pressure. The sudden break sends 
out seismic waves in all directions. It's these waves that we feel as an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Signs along the trail tell us that we are standing on the epicenter of the 1906 
quake -- the place directly above the original break in the ground. Not so, 
according to seismologist Bruce A. Bolt of the University of California at 
Berkeley, who says that the park service is a little shaky in its facts. 
</P>
<P>
Recent investigations have located the epicenter a few miles south of Point 
Reyes, under the waters of the Pacific just outside the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
But the Australian-born Bolt doesn't want to quibble with the authorities of 
his adopted country. "The earthquake walk is certainly at the site of the 
greatest measurable ground movement," he says. "Besides, it's a jolly good 
place to see what quakes can do." 
</P>
<P>
You can still see signs of that movement in an old wooden fence that had been 
built directly across the fault. One section of the fence is now offset some 16 
feet from the other, vividly demonstrating how much the plates lurched past 
each other.

ISLAND OF SANTORINI IS ONE OF GREECE'S LOVELIEST

THIRA, Greece 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tiers of volcanic strata, jutting 600 feet from the sea, dwarfed our steamer as 
we entered the watery caldera of the Greek island of Santorini. 
</P>
<P>
Strange white trimming on the crater's north lip at first resembled autumn 
snow. But the ship's persistent plodding soon brought into focus a tangle of 
Santorini's white homes and domed churches, glued to the cliffs like swallows' 
nests. 
</P>
<P>
Steaming into Santorini's caldera, the largest of its kind visible above the 
sea, can be as awe-inspiring a Greek experience as ambling among the marble 
skeletons of Athens' Acropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Called Kallisti, "The Loveliest," when first settled, Santorini is often 
regarded as the most extraordinary island in the Aegean Sea -- one not to miss 
on a vacation to Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Its villages on cliffs may be the country's most photographed structures after 
the Acropolis. Travelers glimpse Greek island life, experience a history rooted 
in the Atlantis myth and enjoy the comforts of a Greek Island vacation, one 
already well-known to Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Pistachio groves line roadways in the countryside. Grape vines carpet the 
hillsides. Wine production is the life blood of most farmers in this parched 
landscape, where only half an inch of rain falls each year. 
</P>
<P>
Also known as Thira, Santorini is about 30 square miles in size. It is home to 
only 8,000 inhabitants in 16 villages, yet sprinkling the landscape are 360 
small white churches, a few with domes painted blue to symbolize the sky and 
heavens. 
</P>
<P>
As locals joke, Santorini has more churches than houses, more donkeys than 
people and more wine than water. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the sun is more plentiful than even the sweet wines served at eating 
establishments and taverns. Visitors come to soak up the sun on the island's 
black sand and pebble beaches, then spend the evening in the largest village, 
Thira. 
</P>
<P>
Thira looks like the remaining fringe of a larger metropolis that long ago slid 
into the sea. It offers a lively array of shops and cliff-side restaurants 
among a labyrinth of streets made purposefully confusing to outwit pirates, 
hundreds of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at night is festive, busy, commercial: yellow lights from 
display windows flood the narrow streets. Visitors stroll the narrow avenues, 
stepping into shops, traveling to favorite taverns, munching gyros or gelati. 
</P>
<P>
Quiet open-air restaurants by the precipice are each a stage upon which to view 
the whitewashed city aglow on the cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
The village's magical moment, though, comes at dusk when the sun, inching below 
the horizon, washes the white building facades with brilliant pinks and vibrant 
purples. 
</P>
<P>
The village returns to the Greeks at dawn, however. The tourist revelry having 
faded, the home culture surfaces. Grizzled Greek garbage collectors lead teams 
of donkeys through the narrow streets. 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox Christian priests swoop by in long gray robes, black fezes and 
rambling beards. Vendors polish and neatly stack fruit on stands protected from 
the sun by cotton awnings. 
</P>
<P>
Much smaller than Thira, Oia offers Thira's charm without the 
commercialization, making it the island's best retreat. Oia is a short ride 
north of Thira by bus or car on a road that is hair-raisingly narrow against a 
steep hillside. 
</P>
<P>
Oia offers a spectacular view of the sunsets over the ocean. But in this town, 
it's the Greek life itself that can engulf the visitor. Workers and farmers, 
faces heavily stubbled, gather at curb side or congregate in taverns at dusk. 
</P>
<P>
At the west edge of Oia, sunbathers can descend hundreds of steps to a secluded 
beach, then return later upon Greece's oldest taxi, the donkey. 
</P>
<P>
While the island's villages offer both shopping and dining, the arid climate is 
one of the island's main attractions. At Kamari Beach, travelers on vacation 
throw out their towels and rent umbrellas for long days on the hot sands. If 
the rushing surf is not preferred, the Kamari Hotel has a seaside, saltwater 
swimming pool open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
With few overnight accommodations, Perissa Beach attracts day travelers from 
Thira. Beach lovers dine under the thatched roofs of outdoor restaurants that 
line the beach. Small fishing boats often barge ashore to unload crates of 
freshly caught fish, oysters and lobster for waiting residents, restaurateurs 
and storekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
Santorini's role in the myth of Atlantis adds mystique to its reputation. 
Looking on the map like a snake's head with its jaws distended, Santorini's 
watery mouth was formed by a volcanic cataclysm that swapped land for sea about 
1,450 BC, leaving behind the sharply cut rock walls of the caldera and 
destroying the island's Minoan civilization. 
</P>
<P>
On the island's southwest jaw, Akrotiri is an excavated Bronze Age town of 
three-story dwellings. Many of the buildings are surprisingly intact, having 
been sealed under 160 feet of pumice as if packed in plastic. 
</P>
<P>
City streets are cleared and buildings identified for their purposes. 
Akrotiri's frescos of plants, antelopes and apes have been painstakingly 
reassembled in the Akrotiri Museum on Santorini and the Archeological Museum in 
Athens. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Akrotiri's advanced Minoan culture, Santorini is believed to be one 
of the two islands Plato described in his story of Atlantis; Crete is the 
second and largest island. Further, both cultures were destroyed when 
Santorini's volcano erupted. 
</P>
<P>
The cataclysm's earthquake and 200-foot tidal wave devastated the Minoan 
civilization on Crete 70 miles away. Wiped out by the rage of fire and water, 
Santorini and Crete fit Plato's description of Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
The cataclysm, however, sowed the seeds of another island culture. The 
destruction left behind volcanic soils rich for vineyards and pistachio groves, 
black pebbly beaches for sunbathing and hillsides compact enough for digging 
the many underground homes found inland and along the cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
Civilization eventually returned to the island. The remains of the later 
Hellenistic civilization is still evident on Santorini, with its toppled 
columns and foundations of temples, athletic facilities and public markets. 
Visitors can rent donkeys to ride up the switch-back trail to the site. 
</P>
<P>
Santorini, volcanically explosive during its reshaping, now sends travelers an 
invitation to come soak up the sun and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous airlines offer service from Los Angeles to Athens. During April and 
May, KLM has midweek flights available for $799 round trip (30 days' advance 
purchase, 7-day minimum/21-day maximum). June through August, the price jumps 
to $970. TWA and Pan Am offer midweek flights during May for $798 round trip, 
$970 June through August. 
</P>
<P>
As with all Greek islands, Santorini is popular in the summer months, 
especially with college-age travelers. Reservations during peak season 
(July-August) are advised. To avoid the crowds, the island is best visited in 
spring and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Although accommodations are plentiful (hotel workers solicit travelers as they 
disembark the ferry), two hotels are worth recommending. In the village of 
Thira, the Atlantis overlooks the caldera and is next to the picturesque Thira 
cathedral. Price: $136 U.S. double, April through June; slightly higher durin g 
the high season. 
</P>
<P>
At Kamari Beach, the Kamari Hotel ($76 double) has seaside accommodations and a 
saltwater swimming pool, the only pool on the island. Accommodations for both 
are clean and comfortable, but do not expect the luxury of upscale Western 
European hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Taxis and buses are inexpensive and mopeds are available for rent. 
</P>
<P>
Santorini is easily accessible from both Athens and other Greek islands by sea 
or by air. Greece's domestic Olympic Airways offers two flights daily between 
Athens and Santorini. It's $47.20 each way. 
</P>
<P>
Flights are reasonably priced and well worth the cost when balanced against 
losing a day of vacation time aboard a ferry. Ferries connect Piraeus (the port 
of Athens) daily with Santorini, though numerous other stops are made along the 
way. The trip can take upward of 12 hours. Cost is $18 each way. Connections 
are easily made from other islands as well. 
</P>
<P>
While the villages of Thira and Ia are easily explored on foot and are readily 
accessible by taxi or bus, tours of the rest of the island's attractions are 
well worth considering. 
</P>
<P>
Most tours include wine tasting and trips to Akrotiri and Mt. Profitis Ilias, 
which rises 1,200 feet above the small island and offers an encompassing view. 
The guides liven up the tours with stories, though the accuracy of some tales 
is often questionable. Tours are easily arranged at Thira's numerous tourist 
booking agents.

Organization, 611 West 6th St., Suite 2198, Los Angeles 90017, (213) 626-6696.

POINT REYES OFFERS MORE THAN AN EARTHQUAKE TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Point Reyes, site of the Earthquake Trail, is an easy drive of about 50 miles 
from San Francisco. Head north via the Golden Gate Bridge and U.S. 101. Near 
Sausalito turn onto Highway 1, the spectacular coastal route that winds 
directly through the fault zone. 
</P>
<P>
In the town of Olema, you'll see a turnoff marked for the seashore's Bear 
Valley Visitors Center. If you're more pressed for time, continue on U.S. 101 
until the junction with Sir Francis Drake Highway and follow it to Olema. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate Transit Co. provides some bus service from San Francisco. Call 
(415) 332-6600 for schedule information. Most visitors will probably prefer to 
use cars because of the large distances between various points of interest at 
the 65,000-acre seashore. 
</P>
<P>
At the Bear Valley Visitors Center, you'll find many fascinating exhibits 
highlighting Point Reyes' rich ecology. Helpful park rangers will not only give 
you information about the Earthquake Trail, which begins just a few steps away, 
but also about the many other delights of Point Reyes, which include hiking, 
horseback riding, overnight camping, whale and bird watching, and a 
reconstructed Miwok Indian village. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to bring binoculars for close-up views of the wildlife, a camera 
for the many photo opportunities and an extra sweater for the coastal chills 
that can set in even on the sunniest days. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a beachfront cafe on Drake's Beach, where the English adventurer Sir 
Francis Drake is thought to have repaired his ship in 1579, there are no dining 
facilities within the seashore itself. But there are a number of restaurants in 
the nearby towns. 
</P>
<P>
I have enjoyed many hearty and modestly priced Central European meals at 
Vladimir's Czechoslovakian Restaurant in Inverness (12785 Sir Francis Drake 
Blvd.). For those who want to savor locally farmed oysters, Jerry's Farmhouse 
in Olema (10005 Coastal Highway 1) is worth a stop. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to stay overnight, you can book a free campsite through the Bear 
Valley Visitors Center. Call (415) 663-1092. The center can also provide you 
with information on nearby B&amp;Bs and small inns and motels. 
</P>
<P>
Among the lodgings in Olema are the new Seashore Lodge (10021 Coastal Highway 
1, Olema, Calif. 94950, 415-663-9000; $85 to $175 double per night) and the 
Olema Inn (10000 Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, Olema, Calif. 94950, 
415-663-9559; $95 to $105 double), both including breakfast. A nice B&amp;B is 
Roundstone Farm, 9940 Sir Francis Drake Blvd., Olema, Calif. 94950, $105 per 
night, including breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on area lodgings, contact the West Marin Chamber of 
Commerce at (415) 663-9232. FREDERIC GOLDEN

FROM ARGENTINA TO CHILE BY BUS AND FERRY 
</P>

BARILOCHE, Argentina 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chile and Argentina nearly went to war in 1978 over a long-festering border 
dispute, but those animosities have given way to increasingly healthy 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
For the traveler, this means the opportunity to include both countries in a 
single visit. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most exhilarating ways to do so is to make the one- or two-day 
crossing from Bariloche, in southeastern Argentina, to Puerto Montt in 
south-central Chile. In the space of just 210 miles by bus and ferry, travelers 
cross emerald-toned, deep-water lakes, ascend the Andes Mountains, glide 
alongside the perfect cone of the Osorno Volcano and 11,800-foot Tronador 
Mountain, and visit a cascade through hardened lava. 
</P>
<P>
The climatic changes are as dramatic as the landscape. The semi-arid Patagonian 
steppes just east of Bariloche give way to an almost perpetually damp and dense 
jungle and cloud forest near the heights of the Andes, back down into the 
temperate lake district of Chile. No wonder Argentines in particular like to 
escape to Bariloche in the summer. When I left Buenos Aires, it was 101 
degrees; in Bariloche, the day began at a brisk 47 degrees, warming to the 
mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
You can set out on the crossing from either Puerto Montt or Bariloche, both of 
which are reachable from their respective capitals, Santiago and Buenos Aires, 
via several daily flights. 
</P>
<P>
The Andina del Sur travel agency handles arrangements in Chile, and Catedral 
Turismo is the Argentine agent. Both work with national and international 
agents to make bookings. 
</P>
<P>
Guides offer commentaries throughout the journey, in both Spanish and English, 
for the 300 or so people who make the crossing each day in the warmer months 
(December to March). Those on longer trips with lots of baggage needn't worry; 
the crews move the bags from each of the three ferries onto the buses, and into 
the customs shed for a quick inspection at the border. 
</P>
<P>
Bariloche, with a surging population of 60,000, is as much a winter ski resort 
(June-August), attracting many North American addicts, as it is a summer lake 
retreat. The town, on the shore of the long, slender Lake Nahuel Huapi, is 
within the national park of the same name, covering 1.8 million acres up 
against the Chilean border. 
</P>
<P>
Ten different day-tours are available from travel agents to sites, including 
one to 12-mile-long Victoria Island, full of bird life such as cormorants, 
"royal turkey" and pheasants. In some parts of the park, condors soar overhead. 
Another brief side trip is the chairlift trip to the top of 3,300-foot 
Campanario Mountain, for views of the entire lake district. 
</P>
<P>
The tour companies collect travelers from their hotels for the crossing. From 
Bariloche, buses take you to Panuelo for the ferry trip (passengers only) up 
the Puerto Blest arm of the lake through a sheer-walled cut in the mountains. 
The modern, rapid boat has big cabin windows, which is useful because it can 
get frigid on deck. 
</P>
<P>
You alight and board waiting buses for a short ride through triple-canopy 
highlands jungle, where some trees are more than 2,000 years old and 120 feet 
or more in height. Boarding a less majestic craft, you make a brief crossing of 
Lake Frias, where the tallest mountain in the area, 11,800-foot Tronador, 
sweeps into view if the day is clear. 
</P>
<P>
On shore, you arrive at the Argentine immigration office for a courteous if 
lengthy passport-stamping. Chilean guides then take over as the bus ascends the 
3,200-foot pass and enters Chile's Vicente Perez Rosales National Park, where 
the roadside is bright with native orange orchids. 
</P>
<P>
After clearing Chilean immigration and customs, lunch is served at Puelle 
before passengers set off on the two-hour crossing of All Saints Lake, the 
pride of the Chilean Lakes District whose highlight is salmon and trout fishing 
and the Osorno Volcano, which last erupted in 1850. Chile has more than 2,000 
volcanoes, 10% of the world total. All Saints Lake, more than 1,000 feet deep, 
is emerald-colored from the minerals washing down from the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Back aboard more comfortable buses for the final couple of hours through farm 
country to Puerto Montt, the bus pauses at a waterfall and then skirts the 
large Llanquihue Lake before arriving at the town of Puerto Varas. In this 
area, German settlers make up almost a third of the population. Homes of 
distinctive yellow-painted wooden shingles and red zinc roofs offer what 
Chileans regard as an Alpine atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
By evening, the buses reach Puerto Montt, a busy port city of 125,000 that is 
benefitting from Chile's export boom in salmon, wood and other products, 
although it still feels like a small town by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The fare for the one-way trip is about $20 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
In Puerto Montt, the best hotel is the Vicente Perez Rosales, (about $70 U.S., 
double), but several others, including the Hotel Colina (about $45, double), 
are also pleasant. JAMES F. SMITH

TIMES POLL OF S.D. COUNTY SUGGESTS GROWING POLARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego is developing as a county with a split personality, a Los Angeles 
Times Poll has found, with residents in one area more affluent, more 
family-oriented and -- in the eyes of residents elsewhere in the county -- more 
materialistic. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with the rest of San Diego County, North County -- with its 
million-dollar neighborhoods, beachfront condominiums, country estates and 
sprawling tracts of $350,000 homes -- is an upscale place. Its residents are 
convinced that they have found more happiness than residents elsewhere in the 
county. And they are more concerned about losing their Camelot to growth's 
bogey man than are their fellow county residents. 
</P>
<P>
People in the central, southern and eastern portions of San Diego County tend 
to have lived in the county longer, the poll found. They feel more deeply 
rooted in their communities but also are less satisfied with them -- perhaps 
because they also tend to feel more plagued by crime. They are more likely than 
are residents of North County to be liberal, willing to protect the environment 
and interested in helping others. 
</P>
<P>
Those are some of the findings of the Times Poll, which surveyed 1,984 county 
residents -- 1,134 in North County and 850 in the rest of the county -- from 
March 10 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
Pollster I. A. Lewis said the countywide results are within 3 percentage points 
of what they would be if everyone in the county had been questioned; breaking 
that down for North County, the margin of error is 4 percentage points, and for 
the rest of the county it is 5. For the purposes of the poll, North County was 
defined as the area north of Miramar Road and La Jolla and extending as far 
east as Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
The poll's findings confirm long-held assumptions that people are 
</P>
<P>
moving to North County to escape the woes of urban living, said Robyn S. 
Phillips, a UC San Diego professor of urban economics and public policy. 
</P>
<P>
But, with that trend, she fears, comes a growing polarity in San Diego County 
as people seek out the best possible communities -- within their budgets -- to 
establish their roots. 
</P>
<P>
"As North County becomes more and more for the affluent -- people who can 
afford to escape the problems of the city -- there's going to be a widening 
disparity between North County and the rest of the county socio-economically," 
Phillips said. "I worry that the people who can afford to escape to North 
County no longer feel a responsibility toward what they're leaving. They let it 
be someone else's problem." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as people continue to seek out North County, the area's perception as 
a good place to live "tends to reinforce itself," and the disparity between 
North County and the balance of the county -- especially in housing costs -- 
will continue to widen even more quickly, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
She concedes to feeling somewhat sheepish about her observations because she 
and her husband moved from the University City area of San Diego to Del Mar two 
years ago, partly so her husband, a Vista schools official, would be closer to 
work and partly because she sought Del Mar's school system. 
</P>
<P>
"We did what we perceived was best for us and moved," she said. "But, when I 
look back at our decision as an analyst, I see what we did as part of a social 
phenomenon, and I worry about the social implications of what we did." 
</P>
<P>
No matter the distinctions between the two population bases, both share the 
view that the quality of life in San Diego County is not getting any better. In 
fact, about 45% of residents, in North County or elsewhere, say the quality of 
life has worsened during the past 10 years, the Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
Barely half of San Diego County residents believe the beaches are safe for 
swimming, and nearly one in two say worsening air quality is the region's 
biggest environmental problem. 
</P>
<P>
Residents throughout the county also seemed to agree on a range of other topics 
-- that drugs are the county's worst problem, that they want to protect the 
environment even at some cost to the economy and that health is most what they 
want out of life. 
</P>
<P>
But the poll also found striking differences between the demographics and 
attitudes in North County and those elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* North County's residents are less concerned than others in the county about 
affordable housing when it comes to a laundry list of how to pick a community. 
Indeed, they pay nearly 10% more, as a whole, for housing. Put another way, 13% 
of the residents outside North County pay $1,000 or more a month for housing, 
while in North County, 20% pay that much or more. 
</P>
<P>
* North County residents can better afford such prices. While the median 
household income elsewhere in the county is $33,175 -- meaning half make more, 
half make less than that -- the median household income in North County is 
$38,426, or 15% more. 
</P>
<P>
* There are proportionately fewer married couples -- and fewer families -- 
outside North County. 
</P>
<P>
* Residents of the central, southern and eastern parts of the county are older 
-- and have lived in the county longer -- than North County residents. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson is a 37-year-old native of San Diego County who now lives in an 
established neighborhood in Clairemont. He says he has little use for North 
County and what he calls its "instant, sterile, pop-up neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
"North County has become yuppified," said Johnson, who is a teacher at the 
private Francis Parker School in Linda Vista. "And North County is very new. 
There's no sense of history. It's like an instant culture. Maybe there's a lot 
to be said for new neighborhoods. But I've got neighbors who have lived in 
their same homes for 35 years, and I like that." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the most telling distinctions between those who live in North 
County and those who don't are the perceptions both groups hold of those who 
live in North County. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the county's residents characterize North County's residents as 
better off financially, but not necessarily better off in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the rest of the county sees people in North County not only as 
more affluent, but as more materialistic, than themselves. North County people 
are far less likely to see themselves that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, I'm happy right where I am," said 59-year-old James Ball, a 
supervisor for a janitorial firm who has lived in East San Diego for 15 years 
and holds no dream of moving to North County -- even if he could afford to. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, they've gotten away from this and that, and they've got more than me, 
but I think they're more up-tight in North County," he said. "You've got people 
up there driving around in their Mercedes. I don't want to have to keep up with 
the Joneses. I've got my Chevy Nova. That's who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Trumble, the wife of a Roman Catholic deacon who has lived in Mission Hills 
and Lakeside and now lives in El Cajon, feels the same way toward North County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of them as having more money, of being a little higher-class, but I 
don't aspire to live there," she said. "We're beyond that. We're aspiring to 
get on with our lives, and it doesn't include that kind of upward mobility." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, North County has no self-esteem problem. Its residents tend to perceive 
themselves as happier, more family-oriented and more environmentally conscious 
than others in the county perceive them as being. And, although people south 
and east of them home in on North County as a center of traffic snarls, North 
County residents are less likely to see their territory as the hub of such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, residents chose their community because it was close to work. The 
second-ranking reason for living outside North County is affordable housing. 
But, in North County, finding a rural atmosphere is the second most likely 
reason in selecting a specific community -- and indeed, more of them live in 
rustic areas. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because they were seeking a haven away from urban woes, North County 
residents also are much less likely to say crime is a top county problem. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Mike Hamer, who moved to San Diego County seven years ago from England 
to get a job in the local electronics industry and who settled in Rancho 
Penasquitos. 
</P>
<P>
Hamer moved to the area because it was "a new, growing neighborhood" and 
because it was within the esteemed Poway Unified School District, which has 
received substantial amounts of good publicity because of the achievements of 
its students. 
</P>
<P>
"The income level (in his area) is a bit higher," Hamer said. "The neighbors 
have a higher standard of living. We were looking for that for our children. 
It's a safer surrounding for my family. The likelihood of less crime was 
something we were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Hamer chuckled because his wife is now ready to move again. She wants to stay 
in the Poway school district -- but wants a larger home. He says he may comply 
-- especially if he can find a neighborhood with less traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's happy with his decision to settle where he did. 
</P>
<P>
"You get vibes about neighborhoods, and that there are definite areas in the 
county that are better than others. I think I've found one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hamer, North County people are, as a whole, more satisfied with their 
communities than those living elsewhere. And, where they are dissatisfied, it's 
for somewhat different reasons, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
Although both North County residents and their counterparts elsewhere say 
increased traffic is what they dislike most about their community, North County 
residents rank growth in their community as the second most negative factor, 
while residents elsewhere say it is crime. 
</P>
<P>
In North County, where the existence of migrant camps next to housing tracts 
has caused some community friction, people are more apt to take a dim view of 
the effect of the Latino life style in the county, and particularly of the 
impact of immigrants to the region, than are other county residents. 
</P>
<P>
North County residents are more likely to say that they would be bothered at 
least a little if more Latinos moved into their neighborhoods -- 41%, compared 
with 34% for the rest of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although residents outside North County are more likely to cite the cultural 
contribution immigrants have made in the county, North County residents are 
more likely than the others to say immigrants have put a strain on social 
services and are responsible for driving up the crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
But North County residents are also more likely than residents elsewhere to 
give credit to immigrants for providing a cheap source of labor. 
</P>
<P>
North County's greater degree of animosity toward Latinos and immigrants, said 
Times pollster Lewis, is money-driven. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have more property to value -- and they tend to in North County -- 
are more sensitive to their property values. The people of North County are 
more biased against Latinos moving into their neighborhood than are the people 
elsewhere in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Ball, the East San Diego resident, said he would feel uncomfortable moving to 
North County because he is black. North County, which is about 1% black, is 
unlikely to have a neighborhood with a substantial black population, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can figure that a black person in North County is either in the military 
or he's a professional athlete," Ball said with a laugh. "When you've got 2,000 
white sheep, the black sheep is going to stick out. I don't think I'd feel real 
comfortable up there." 
</P>
<P>
Trumble, the El Cajon resident, said she has been conscious -- in every 
community where she has lived -- of the figurative "good and bad side of the 
tracks," and suggests that in San Diego County, Interstate 8 is now that 
divider. 
</P>
<P>
"But what I've noticed about California, and San Diego in particular, is that, 
with all the population moving in, the location of those tracks always seem to 
be moving," Trumble said. "So it's almost like a crapshoot, wondering what part 
of the county will suddenly be upscale and what part won't be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Diego County's Two Counties 
</P>
<P>
Two populations with different demographics and some different opinions emerge 
when North San Diego County is compared with the rest of the county. Although 
North County residents are on the whole newer to the county, they lead more 
settled lives, tending more to be married and have children and mortgages. They 
are less plagued by crime, more likely to be completely satisfied with their 
community-and they are significantly more affluent.

SCHOOL DISTRICT'S FINANCE HEAD RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As teachers and administrators at the Ventura Unified School District continue 
to wrangle over a new contract, the district's finance director -- who has 
played a key role in the talks -- announced last week that he is quitting. 
Frank Sandall said he's resigning his job with the county's third-largest 
school district to take a similar job with a small, rural school district 
outside Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
But in parting, Sandall said the Ventura district must "act and act quickly" to 
put its ailing finances in order. He said the issue now snagging the contract 
talks -- who will pay for skyrocketing costs of retired teachers' health 
benefits -- is of paramount importance to the district's future solvency. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the district and the teachers union reached a tentative 
agreement on a new three-year contract. But rank-and-file teachers later 
rejected the pact in a straw vote, mostly because it would have required them 
to pay for retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Sandall, however, maintained that unless district employees absorb the cost of 
retiree benefits or the district finds another way to fund those expenses, 
financial disaster eventually could occur. "I don't think that it's anything 
that they can't get out of, but they've got to act and act quickly to shore up 
any of these areas that down the road could possibly cause serious financial 
difficulties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandall cited a 1988 study that said the district needs to set aside between $4 
million and $6 million per year for 15 years to cover retiree costs. But the 
district has set aside no money since that report and continues to pay benefits 
out of yearly revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost this year for the district's 600 teachers alone is $1 
million. According to the independent study, the cost of health benefits for 
all retired employees, estimated at $2.1 million for 1989-90, could double or 
triple within 10 years as more district employees retire and the cost of health 
care rises. 
</P>
<P>
Based on projections through the year 2017, the study by a Los Angeles 
consulting firm estimated that the district could face retiree costs as high as 
$21 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Because the district has set aside no reserve for future claims, the cost of 
retiree benefits will prove increasingly difficult to pay, Sandall said. He 
suggested the district could raise some money through creative moves such as 
swapping undeveloped district land for revenue-producing properties. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the district is to avoid financial collapse it must immediately 
alter its current policy of awarding lifetime health benefits, he said. Most 
other school districts stop paying medical benefits at age 65, Sandall said.

POPULATION RISING, BUT CRIME RATE FALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, the statistics appeared paradoxical indeed: Although Ventura 
County's population boomed in the 1980s, its crime rate plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, the county's population jumped by 26%, as about 140,000 new 
residents poured in. But during the same period, its crime rate plunged 22%, 
according to police statistics released last week. 
</P>
<P>
For the average Ventura County resident, the numbers reflect what many already 
know: the county is a pretty safe place to live. But for police officials, they 
reflect a combination of tougher treatment of criminals, successful 
crime-prevention tactics and demographic luck. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, about 550 fewer crimes were reported in 1989 than in 1980, police 
reported. And the reduction in reported crime was felt in nearly every part of 
the county, regardless of poverty or wealth. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Oxnard, the county's largest city and one of its poorest, had more 
than 1,000 fewer crimes at the end of the 1980s than at the beginning. Its 
crime rate, substantially higher than the state average 10 years ago, is now 
substantially lower. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures prepared by local police agencies for the FBI, murders, 
rapes, robberies, burglaries and arsons were all down sharply last year from a 
decade before, making Ventura the most crime-free urban county in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities attributed the situation in part to the absence in 
Ventura County of large inner-city slums, where crime is usually high. They 
also credited Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury's policy against plea bargaining, 
even on minor offenses, and stiff sentencing by local judges, who rate 
statistically as California's toughest. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Police Chief Robert P. Owens said the declining crime rate also is 
attributable to a drop in the number of youths in the crime-prone ages of 12 to 
20. School officials said there were nearly the same number of junior- and 
senior-high school students in the county in 1981 as in 1989, about 49,000. 
</P>
<P>
Owens added that burglaries in the city are at a 12-year low because of a city 
ordinance requiring dead bolt locks and solid doors on homes. He said robberies 
dropped from 540 in 1980 to 320 last year, in part because police circulated in 
local farm-labor camps, telling workers it was unwise to carry large wads of 
cash on pay days because of the chances of getting robbed. 
</P>
<P>
The two biggest classes of newcomers to the county were immigrant Latinos and 
affluent commuters. Authorities said both groups tend to adapt quickly to the 
county's "old-fashioned, small town values." 
</P>
<P>
"The urban syndrome is something they've moved away from," said county 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg.

BUILDER BARS RADON TESTS BY POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that raised state regulators' eyebrows, a major developer selling 
nearly 1,000 new houses in the Camarillo and Oak Park areas is prohibiting 
prospective customers from testing for radon gas before closing their house 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee Construction Co. is also requiring all California customers to sign a 
contract agreeing not to hold the company responsible if the cancer-causing gas 
is found after the sale is completed. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the state Department of Real Estate, Pardee is the 
first major California developer to place restraints on potential buyers since 
the radon gas danger was revealed two years ago. And, as state health officials 
continue studying the radioactive gas, they say they expect that the number of 
developers asking customers to sign radon disclaimers to rise, especially in 
Ventura County, where the highest levels of the hazardous substance in the 
state have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
In the first statewide residential radon study, state researchers monitored 385 
houses in California, including 15 in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
On a statewide basis, only 1% of all the houses surveyed exceeded the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's recommended maximum radon concentration of 4 
picocuries per liter. But in Ventura County, it is estimated that between 10% 
and 15% of the houses could exceed that level. That estimate is based on 
sampling over a 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Using standard statistical techniques, researchers say, they are able to 
extrapolate the statewide results with a fair degree of accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
A more extensive yearlong survey of 1,000 homes in the Ventura region is 
scheduled to be completed by the state in June. 
</P>
<P>
The gas, which seeps up from the ground, is believed to be the second-leading 
cause of lung cancer in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Yantz, Pardee's assistant vice president of California sales, said his 
company began asking customers to sign the radon disclaimers about a year ago 
after an East Coast developer was sued by a homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
"We have every right to dictate our terms," Yantz said. "So far the disclaimer 
has not hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Pardee's Ventura County developments requiring customers to sign the contract 
include the Capri subdivision on Lindero Canyon Road in Oak Park, and the 
Montelena and Fairfield subdivisions in Camarillo, near Santa Rosa Road. 
</P>
<P>
Although Yantz said no one has challenged Pardee's radon disclaimer in court, 
lawyers with the state Department of Real Estate, the state attorney general's 
office and the California Assn. of Realtors all questioned the validity of the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems unreasonable for the developer to say, 'I won't test for radon and 
you can't test, but if you find it later, I won't be held liable,' " said Gail 
Ruderman Feuer, a deputy attorney general. "We need to look at it further." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Barfield, an attorney with the California Assn. of Realtors, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"This could open up a brand new area of law" and set a state precedent, 
Barfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Les Bettencourt, a managing deputy commissioner with the Department of Real 
Estate, said he would discourage buyers from signing the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have a problem with it," Bettencourt said. "The consumers should be 
allowed to test for radon. It's almost like the developer is saying, 'Hey, we 
know there's a problem, but we don't want you to find out about it.' "

BRALY DENIES URGING POT DECRIMINALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a mini-blizzard of news releases, a conservative Republican activist last 
week injected the politically pungent issue of decriminalizing marijuana into 
the race between Assemblywoman Cathie Wright of Simi Valley and Hunt Braly, her 
GOP challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Braly, who has accused fellow Republican Wright of ethics violations, suddenly 
found himself denying charges that, as head of a Republican college group in 
1980, he advocated the legalization of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were leveled by conservative GOP activist Steve Frank, a Simi 
Valley public affairs consultant and admitted Wright supporter. 
</P>
<P>
During an endorsement meeting of a local chapter of the conservative California 
Republican Assembly, Frank produced a flyer he maintained was printed by the 
college group headed by Braly, a one-time USC student. The flyer, in part, 
urged decriminalizing marijuana for personal use, saying it was "ludicrous" to 
put small-time pot users in jail with "rapists and murderers." 
</P>
<P>
The flyer carried a phone number that matched what appeared to be Braly's 
former home number on another document produced by Frank. But Braly, an aide to 
state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), a former Los Angeles police chief, 
denied that he ever advocated legalizing drugs -- or smoked marijuana himself. 
</P>
<P>
Braly said he "didn't recall" the flyer or whether his college group ever 
formally advocated pot decriminalization. He also said local chapters of the 
organization, California College Republicans, often printed their own 
handbills, attaching his phone number because his apartment served as 
headquarters for the cash-starved group. 
</P>
<P>
But the manner in which the pot charge surfaced was almost as interesting as 
the charge itself. Frank, an ex-CRA president who noted that he is no friend of 
the "liberal" Braly, said he received the pro-pot flyer in the mail but had no 
idea who the sender was. Asked if Wright's campaign had anything to do with 
slipping Frank the material, Wright campaign manager Mark Thomas said, "I don't 
have any knowledge of that." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever sent it, the material had the desired effect. Frank dispatched news 
releases about the flyer to no fewer than 47 newspapers and radio and 
television stations. And after he presented it to his CRA chapter, the group 
unanimously voted to endorse the conservative Wright over Braly in their June 5 
face-off for the GOP nomination in the 37th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his denials, the resulting publicity put Braly on the defensive, at 
least momentarily, in his effort to spear Wright with the ethics issue. On the 
stump, Braly has repeatedly called attention to Wright's well-publicized 
attempts to intervene with police and judges on behalf of her daughter, 
Victoria, who faced jail or losing her license after receiving 28 traffic 
tickets over several years.

UNFAIR TREATMENT OF OAK GROVE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the father of two daughters, one enrolled at Thacher and one at Oak Grove, I 
am deeply saddened by your grotesquely unfair treatment of Oak Grove School. 
Your article implies that Oak Grove tolerates substance abuse, when in fact it 
may be the most alcohol- and drug-free campus, public or private, in the entire 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The article dwells upon a party hosted by Oak Grove students at which five 
Thacher girls "allegedly encountered beer being served and marijuana being 
smoked." It states that the five Thacher girls were expelled or suspended, 
whereas none of the Oak Grove students was punished. 
</P>
<P>
Your article fails to explain that of the approximately 40 kids at the party 
(which was chaperoned by five adults), only six were Oak Grove students, 
all-day students attending with their parents' consent. Two of them were the 
"hosting students," with both their parents in attendance at all times, and one 
was my elder daughter. Neither my daughters nor the adults observed any Oak 
Grove student consuming or under the influence of any alcohol or drugs. In the 
circumstances, there was no occasion for discipline by Oak Grove. 
</P>
<P>
There were eight Thacher students in attendance in all. The five who were 
disciplined by Thacher were boarding students who were absent from campus 
without permission, and who were also present at the party without invitation. 
The other three Thacher students, including my younger daughter, were either 
day students or a boarding student attending with their parents' knowledge and 
consent. Those three did not consume any alcohol or drugs. Being innocent, they 
also went unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
Again, according to my daughters and the host parents, no alcohol was "served" 
to any minor at the party, and any that was consumed was brought to the 
premises without the consent or knowledge of the hosts. I am further informed 
that the students dismissed from Thacher admitted to their school authorities 
it was they who had brought the marijuana to the party. 
</P>
<P>
Two valuable lessons can be learned from this incident: 
</P>
<P>
1. Parents who undertake to host a party for a large number of high school 
students must be prepared to provide an extraordinary high degree of 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
2. Newspapers that seek respect must be prepared to substitute fairness and 
accuracy for slanderous sensationalism. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure the parents in question have learned their lesson; I wish I could be 
confident you will learn yours.

SUPERVISORS APPROVE EAST L.A. MARCH COMMEMORATING 1970 PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors has overruled the Sheriff's Department and 
granted Chicano activists a permit to march in East Los Angeles this summer to 
commemorate the 20th anniversary of a chaotic anti-war march that ended in the 
death of newsman Ruben Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by Supervisor Ed Edelman, the supervisors on a 3-1 vote Thursday 
overturned the sheriff's denial of a request for a parade permit by the Los 
Angeles members of the 1990 National Chicano Moratorium Committee for a march 
Aug. 25 along Atlantic and Whittier boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The request was rejected two months ago by sheriff's officials at the East Los 
Angeles station who said the 3-mile march would unduly disrupt traffic and 
business along the proposed route and would cost too much. Overtime pay for 
deputies was estimated at $37,400.

Some merchants on Whittier Boulevard also were fearful of a reoccurrence of 
violence that marred the march on Aug. 29, 1970. More than 200 people were 
arrested, 60 others were injured and three people died in the march's violent 
aftermath. Among the dead was Salazar, then a Times columnist and news director 
at Spanish-language television station KMEX. 
</P>
<P>
Parade organizers were pleased with the decision, saying that concerns about 
violence were overblown. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a smoke-screen excuse to deny us our rights," said Carlos Montes, 
co-chairman of the committee organizing the parade. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 people may participate in the march to mark what organizers 
say is a significant chapter in the modern history of U.S. residents of Mexican 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 protesters marched 20 years ago to decry the high casualty rate 
among Chicano soldiers in Vietnam. But the march turned violent and rioting and 
looting ensued along Whittier Boulevard. Businesses there suffered $1 million 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
In the violence, Salazar died inside a bar when he was struck by a tear-gas 
projectile fired by a sheriff's deputy. A coroner's inquest later found that 
the newsman died accidentally, but many Chicano activists believe that Salazar, 
then 42, was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Although other observances have been held in the past to mark the 1970 march, 
some Whittier Boulevard merchants said they wanted no part of another march 
this year.

LINES FORM FOR ADOPTION OF WILD HORSES, BURROS FROM GOVERNMENT LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nine-year-old Laura Riedman knew exactly what she wanted at the Bureau of Land 
Management's wild horse and burro adoption Friday at Pierce College in Woodland 
Hills. And she found it. 
</P>
<P>
The blonde fourth-grader chose a 6-month-old black and brown filly because "she 
was pretty, she looked calm, she had nice eyes, she had a strong back, she had 
straight legs and she had a good strong chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I love horses," said the gum-chewing youngster from La Mesa, east of San 
Diego. "They're big and beautiful and fast and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Riedman's mustang had been rounded up in the high desert near China Lake, near 
Ridgecrest in the Mojave Desert, which the federal BLM says is overpopulated 
with horses and burros. The animals were trucked to holding pens in Ridgecrest 
and then to adoption sites. At Pierce, the BLM offered 75 horses for $125 each 
and 20 burros for $75 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Nunn, wild horse and burro technician for the BLM's Riverside District, 
said that because of a cut in federal funding, only one adoption will be held 
in Southern California this year and that many animals will be shipped for 
adoption to the East or Midwest. There were four adoptions in Southern 
California in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more people who want them than can get them," said Becky Borquez, 
state coordinator for the American Mustang and Burro Assn. "The problem is, why 
subject them to a three-day ride? They get cuts and bruises and banged up. They 
kick each other. I'd like to see them kept here." 
</P>
<P>
The donkeys, which is another name for burros, proved more popular than the 
mustangs. By midday, animal enthusiasts had claimed 11 burros, which are about 
the size of Shetland ponies, but only 16 horses. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining animals will be available to the public from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A beaming Caren Woodruff of Fullerton was the first Friday to take home a 
donkey, a 2-year-old gray female. 
</P>
<P>
"She started to walk toward me in the pen," Woodruff said as her new animal 
kicked lightly against the side of the trailer. "She seemed a little friendlier 
than the others and I thought I'd have a better time teaching her." 
</P>
<P>
Gemini Herzog, a Pierce College student seeking a burro for adoption, said that 
since 1982, she has owned a pet donkey that she keeps at her home in 
Garberville in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the greatest pet," Herzog said. "She hangs out in the yard. You can put 
a pack on her. She thinks she's a person. She'll come into the house if you let 
her. She drinks soda from a can if you hold it. If you have a cup and walk by 
with it, she'll drink out of that." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as an unadoptable burro," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the burros are popular, horse lovers such as Laura Riedman and her 
father, Dick, a Cal State San Diego professor, were equally pleased by the 
opportunity to take home a healthy mustang. 
</P>
<P>
Riedman selected a 4-year-old steel-gray gelding that shook the metal rails of 
his holding pen and repeatedly kicked the wooden gate behind him before being 
allowed to run through a chute into the Riedmans' trailer. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the way he moved and positioned himself with the other horses," said 
Riedman, explaining why he selected the gelding. "Mustangs have qualities of 
durability that appeal to me." 
</P>
<P>
Observers said that with caring owners, even the wild mustangs would become 
good pets. 
</P>
<P>
"Their experience with humans hasn't been real terrific," Borquez said. "In 
their first contact, they get rounded up by helicopters and placed in big 
corrals and freeze-branded on the neck. 
</P>
<P>
"But once they build up trust, they are wonderful. I have a mustang mare who's 
4 years old and I swear if she could crawl into my lap, she would." 
</P>

QUIET RACE AVOIDS ISSUE OF COSTLY CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With only days remaining before the Beverly Hills city election, challenger 
Trisha Roth issued her campaign poster, an acid-rock-inspired graphic 
denouncing the evils of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Max Salter turned over nearly $20,000 in contributions to the 
city's schools, short of his goal of $70,000 outlined in a campaign promise. 
</P>
<P>
And fellow incumbent Robert K. Tanenbaum trudged door to door on Bedford Drive, 
speaking of his achievements at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the scene these days in Beverly Hills, where the council race is so 
polite that no one is hammering away at the city's biggest and most 
embarrassing headache -- multimillion-dollar cost overruns on Beverly Hills' 
lavish Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
In an election that was almost canceled for lack of interest, the nearly 
$100-million price tag of the Civic Center has emerged as the phantom issue -- 
with the project nearly completed, everyone seems aware there is no turning 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The Civic Center -- a renovated City Hall, parking structure, fire station, 
police station and library -- was originally estimated to cost $36 million and 
became a subject of dispute when the contractor quit for two months, claiming 
the city wouldn't pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
Salter, who contends that what amounts to a financial crisis in Beverly Hills 
would be good fortune in another city, tells residents that the Civic Center 
issue has been overblown. 
</P>
<P>
Now serving as mayor, Salter told guests at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast 
Thursday that the city is as prosperous as its reputation, with a portfolio 
worth $128 million as of Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell you about the crisis of the city," he fumed. "Every city in the 
country would like to be in the condition that Beverly Hills is in. And that's 
the honest-to-God truth. It's absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Salter spent about $100,000 getting elected when he first ran for office four 
years ago. He hoped to raise a similar amount this year and give most of it to 
charity, together with a matching grant of his own. 
</P>
<P>
But he said this week that the response has been disappointing. So far he has 
turned over checks totaling about $19,000 to the Beverly Hills Educational 
Foundation, but he promises at least $50,000 to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
He said the state of the schools is more troubling to Beverly Hills residents 
than the cost of the Civic Center, especially because the Beverly Hills Unified 
School District is largely supported by state funds. 
</P>
<P>
"There's your crisis," he said. "When you have to lay off teachers . . . when 
you're talking about taking a school district that was one of the best in the 
country and reducing it, then you have problems." 
</P>
<P>
The election, moved up from April 10 to Tuesday so as not to conflict with 
Passover, was about to be canceled when Roth declared her candidacy. The 
incumbents welcomed her challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"When you don't have an election, there's a latent feeling of resentment toward 
the elected officers, and that's just not healthy," Tanenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
A pediatrician and political novice, Roth turned to local politics after making 
a name for herself stressing alcohol, drugs and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents she is challenging are entrenched in Beverly Hills and are 
formidable opponents: Salter is a garment industry tycoon whose chain of Beno's 
stores covers much of the state; Tanenbaum is an attorney, novelist and 
screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
Roth has chosen not to play the Civic Center issue to the hilt during most of 
her campaign -- although her husband on Friday did place a full-page ad in a 
local paper reading, "Vote for Trisha Roth. $100 Million for the Civic Center 
So Far." 
</P>
<P>
Some observers question whether Roth's concerns match those of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"She's focused her attention on this alcohol bit, which is a magnificent effort 
and will serve the community, but it doesn't run the show at the City Council," 
said Herm Shultz, president of Concern for Tenants Rights of Beverly Hills, a 
renters' group. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that she forced the election, she's done a service, but to the 
extent that she's made it interesting, she hasn't," said Rudy Cole, a public 
relations consultant who managed Salter's campaign in 1986 but has kept out of 
this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his organization endorsed Tanenbaum and Salter but that Roth got 
almost as many votes as Salter in the 17-member board's secret election. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said that if elected she will seek an investigation of the Civic Center 
cost, more money for schools, a regional traffic plan, formation of a 
substance-abuse task force and other goals. 
</P>
<P>
Public discontent may indeed boost her chances in Tuesday's election. "This is 
one election where not being an incumbent is an advantage," Roth said. "As the 
price of the Civic Center goes up, my stock goes up." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Municipal League sent out a mailing last week declaring Beverly 
Hills to be "a city in crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Without endorsing anyone, the citizen group's board of directors called for an 
independent audit of the Civic Center project and asked, "Who is minding the 
store?" 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Tanenbaum agrees with Salter that the schools' budget crisis is a 
prominent issue in Beverly Hills. People are also concerned about public safety 
and the Civic Center, which he has denounced as a Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tanenbaum and Salter took the opportunity this season to remind voters of 
their achievements in office. They said those include securing more money for 
schools and building new public parking garages.

PADRES' SALE EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED SOON 
</P>

<P>
It appears that baseball's longest-running soap opera finally will have its own 
producer, sources said, when the Padres are expected to announce as early as 
Monday that the club will be sold for $75 million to television producer Tom 
Werner of Los Angeles and nine limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
The sale almost was completed a week ago until a glitch held things up, a 
source close to the investment group said Saturday. The group is confident that 
a letter of intent will be executed perhaps on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Padre owner Joan Kroc and chief executive Jerry Kapstein each refused comment, 
but a member of the group, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said 
that the deal is in its final stages. 
</P>
<P>
"We all agreed not to talk to the press about this," a limited partner said, 
"but I guess they (Kroc and Kapstein) decided to leak it out." 
</P>
<P>
Werner, 39, a partner in Carsey-Werner Co., which produces "The Cosby Show," 
and "Roseanne," among other TV shows, would be the managing general partner of 
the Padres if the sale is completed. Yet, sources in the group said, Werner 
will own less than 50% of the club. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthiest of the group, sources said, is Ernest Rady of San Diego, 
chairman of the American Assets and Insurance Co. of the West. The others 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scott Wolfe, a partner in the law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins who put the 
group together. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Russell Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive officer of Republic 
Pictures and a director of City National Bank in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arthur Rivkin, former president of Coca-Cola Bottling of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leon Parma, president and owner of Coast Distributing Co., who also is a 
major stockholder at the La Jolla Bank and Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arthur Engel, president of Southwest Marine Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jackson W. Goodall, CEO and chairman of Foodmaker Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 -- L. Robert Payne, president of Mission Valley Associates Inc. and part-owner 
of the Doubletree Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Malin Burnham, chairman of First National Bank and John Burnham and Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to talk to you early next week," Wolfe said, "but Tommy and I 
are not at liberty to discuss this right now." 
</P>
<P>
Beth Benes, Padre general counsel said: "I don't have anything to say right 
now. I can't comment." 
</P>
<P>
The eight-man baseball owners' committee, however, which screens the transfer 
of major-league franchises, already is familiar with the prospective sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been closely involved because of all the labor negotiations," 
Milwaukee Brewers' owner Bud Selig said, "but from what I understand, it's very 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Once the parties sign a letter of intent, Werner and his partners will have up 
to 45 days to study the Padres' books and operations. At the same time, the 
screening committee will be examining the financial statements of all the 
ownership partners. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll have to divulge all of their financial information, and their complete 
backgrounds will be checked," said Kansas City Royals President Joe Burke, a 
member of baseball's expansion committee. "They're extremely thorough." 
</P>
<P>
If the Werner group agrees to purchase the team after 45 days, and is endorsed 
by the screening committee, the major-league owners would have to approve the 
transfer by a vote at their quarterly meetings June 13-14 in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been at this a long time," said a member of the ownership group. "We're 
just keeping our fingers crossed right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres went on the market Oct. 17 for $100 million, but with the exception 
of a group headed by Sid and Jenny Craig of Del Mar in December, there have not 
been any impending deals. Several high-profile names expressed interest in the 
club, including Lakers' majority owner Jerry Buss and Kings' owner Bruce 
McNall. Yet, they never were allowed the opportunity to enter serious 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Werner, who recently sold the rights to The Cosby Show for $50 million to NBC, 
is co-creator and executive producer of The Cosby Show and Roseanne. He also is 
an executive producer of "A Different World" and "Grand." 
</P>
<P>
News of the pending sale circulated throughout the Padre clubhouse Saturday, 
prompting numerous jokes and skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll believe it when I see it," Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn said. "We've been 
over this road before. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we started hearing about it, a lot of guys were making jokes and 
stuff, wondering if maybe we can get some guest spots on The Cosby Show. Joe 
Carter was talking about going on Different World and taking Whitley out to 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"If this thing works out, great. If it doesn't, we're in good hands." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have been in a flux of transition since the January, 1984 death of 
Padre owner Ray Kroc. The club has gone through four managers, one who was a 
no-show on the eve of spring training; three presidents, one which made an 
obscene gesture to the crowd on fan appreciation day; two son-in-laws, one who 
installed a secret door-opener in his office; and hundreds of players, one who 
accused Kroc of poisoning the world with her cheeseburgers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that's gone on here would be funny to everyone else," one 
front-office employee said, "but when you've been through all of this, it's not 
funny in the least."

TOP DERBY CONTENDERS ARE TIGHTLY BUNCHED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the season when anticipation for the Kentucky Derby starts to build, 
and when racing fans start to develop allegiances to the 3-year-olds they like. 
Last year at this time, for example, New Yorkers were extolling Easy Goer as a 
potential superhorse and Californians were saying that a youngster named Sunday 
Silence might have great potential. 
</P>
<P>
But with the 1990 Kentucky Derby only about five weeks away, I have still not 
heard a single horseplayer on either coast proclaim, " -- - is my Derby horse." 
The majority of colts who looked like contenders at the start of the year have 
discredited themselves with bad performances. Most major stakes races have been 
won virtually by default. And the 3-year-olds who have run well are surrounded 
by questions involving their stamina or their fitness. 
</P>
<P>
I could not come close to compiling a credible top-10 list of Kentucky Derby 
contenders. Instead, here are the top five: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1. Mister Frisky is the only 3-year-old in America with an aura of star 
quality about him. He won all 13 of his starts in Puerto Rico, leading all the 
way in each of them, then came to California and beat the best colts in his age 
group in races at seven furlongs and one mile. Already he possesses the 
second-longest winning streak in history. He could equal Citation's record in 
the Santa Anita Derby April 7, and break it in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of this formidable record, Mister Frisky is only a tepid favorite in 
Las Vegas future book wagering. Doubts persist about his ability to go 1 1/4 
miles. Even when he won the one-mile San Rafael Stakes he had everything in his 
favor. "That day," said the West Coast's top handicapper, Jeff Siegel, "he got 
a comfortable lead in a slow pace, and he was running on a very speed-favoring 
track. He's head-and-shoulders above what we have out here so far, but I want 
to see if he can go a distance." 
</P>
<P>
 -- 2. Summer Squall was one of the country's top 2 year olds last season, when 
he won all five of his starts. But he was sidelined by an injury, and his 
comeback was delayed when he bled in a workout at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It was serious," said owner Cot Campbell of Dogwood Stable. "He bled severely 
from both nostrils." 
</P>
<P>
The colt was all but counted out of Derby contention until he made his debut in 
the seven-furlong Swale Stakes at Gulfstream and ran a sensational race to 
finish second behind the brilliant sprinter Housebuster. But trainer Neil 
Howard is being forced to play a difficult game of catch-up with Summer Squall, 
who still has never run in a distance race. He will get the chance on Saturday, 
when he runs against a good field in the $500,000 Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 3. Champagneforashley remains the most enigmatic of the Kentucky Derby 
contenders. He won all three of his starts as a 2 year old, all by big margins 
over horrendous fields in New York. Then trainer Howie Tesher bypassed the more 
prestigious stakes races at Gulfstream this winter to run Champagneforashley 
against nonentities in the Tampa Bay Derby. The colt won, as expected, but he 
won by a narrow margin and came down with a case of colic thereafter. Because 
of that setback, Tesher doesn't want to tax Champagneforashley too much now, 
and he will run him in one more soft spot before the Wood Memorial Stakes at 
Aqueduct April 21. So Champagneforashley will remain undefeated and unknown for 
a while longer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 4. Tarascon finished within a length of Mister Frisky in California, then 
went to Oaklawn Park in Arkansas and blew away a field in a stakes race. If 
Mister Frisky is the top Derby contender, Tarascon can't be far behind, but the 
same doubts surround them both: distance-running ability. Tarascon is basically 
a speed horse too, and his pedigree may not permit him to run effectively at 1 
1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 5. Unbridled emerged as the top 3-year-old in Florida this winter when he 
won the Florida Derby by four lengths. However, the slow times of the major 
stakes at Gulfstream suggest that the horses there -- including Slavic, Yonder, 
Roanoke, Rhythm, Shot Gun Scott and Smelly -- were a mediocre bunch. Unbridled 
was the best of a bad lot, but at least he has the seasoning, the stamina, the 
pedigree and the stretch-running style to win the Kentucky Derby if the others 
on this list flop. 
</P>
<P>
This could well be a year in which a horse wins America's most famous race by 
default. The key to the Derby probably belongs to Mister Frisky. If he flops 
when he attempts to run 1 1/8 miles on April 7, the Derby will be wide-open. 
But if Mister Frisky proves his stamina, he will go to Louisville as one of the 
most talked-about and exciting Derby favorites in many years.

THE SHRINKING NETS OF GOALIE PATRICK ROY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT FACHET, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After rookie goalie Patrick Roy earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most 
valuable player of Montreal's 1986 Stanley Cup triumph, he absorbed a lesson 
that has helped him become the number one man at his profession. 
</P>
<P>
"My second year, after winning the Conn Smythe and the Stanley Cup, I was not 
in shape," he said. "This year I have benefited from the experience of that 
year. I won the Vezina and a lot of other awards last year, but I just put them 
aside and started out fresh this time. And I'm happy the way things have gone." 
</P>
<P>
Roy ought to be happy. Playing behind a relatively inexperienced defense, he 
has posted a league-leading 30 victories and .911 save percentage, along with a 
2.56 goals-against average that ranks second by a hair to Washington's Mike 
Liut. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been Pat's best year," said Canadiens Coach Pat Burns. "He's played 
awfully strong. We've had injuries on defense and we've often had to go with 
five defensemen, some without much experience. Pat knows he has to make big 
saves if mistakes are made, and he has done that." 
</P>
<P>
"Every game we expect Pat to make the big save, the medium save, the little 
save," said winger Ryan Walter. "And he expects to do it, and does it. He has 
to be the premier goalie in the league." 
</P>
<P>
At age 20, Roy broke in with considerable flair in 1985-86. He quickly became 
the Canadiens' number one goaltender, won 23 regular season games and was 
absolutely brilliant in the playoffs, posting a 15-5, 1.92 record. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his 2.93 and 2.90 goals-against averages the next two seasons, 
contributing to Jennings Trophy status with Brian Hayward as Montreal allowed 
the fewest goals in the NHL, Roy toiled in the shadows of Ron Hextall and Grant 
Fuhr. 
</P>
<P>
Roy emerged from those shadows last season when he posted a 33-5-6, 2.47 record 
and went unbeaten in 34 games on home ice. He completed a hat trick of 
goaltending awards -- third straight Jennings, Vezina as best goalie in a vote 
of general managers and Trico, for highest save percentage (.908). 
</P>
<P>
There was no follow-up Stanley Cup ring, but that hardly was Roy's fault. He 
won 13 of 19 starts and his 2.09 goals-against average was lower than that of 
victorious Calgary's Mike Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even Roy admits he probably is performing better this season -- without 
three key defensemen. With Rick Green retired, Larry Robinson in Los Angeles 
and Chris Chelios missing 24 games because of knee problems, the Canadiens 
could have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Hayward has struggled, slipping from last season's 20 victories and 
2.90 goals-against mark to a mediocre 10-12-5, 3.47. But Roy has been 
sensational, a principal reason Montreal ranks fourth overall despite so many 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had lots of experience on defense and not a lot of injuries," Roy 
said. "This year has been a nice challenge. I reported in shape at training 
camp and I wanted to have a good season. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, we made mistakes because there wasn't much experience, but 
we've been playing real good defense lately even without Chelios. I've 
concentrated every game and I think it probably is my best season, better than 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing with a great bunch of guys and I want to help them finish high in 
the standings, then go for the Stanley Cup. It's not a question of individual 
trophies. They're nice and I'll be proud of them at the end of my career, but 
I'm not thinking about them now." 
</P>
<P>
Roy remains as charismatic as he was during the 1986 playoffs, when all of 
North America became enthralled with his routine of talking to the goal posts. 
</P>
<P>
Before each game, he skates halfway to the blueline, turns and stares at the 
net for a few seconds before returning to the crease. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm imagining the net shrinking," Roy said. "I think every goalie needs a 
superstition. The goal posts are always with me. They talk back to me and when 
they say 'Bing,' I know they're with me. Of course, sometimes they have a bad 
night too." 
</P>
<P>
Too often these nights, the posts become dislodged during intense play around 
the goal. But Roy says he has never tried to give his friends an intentional 
shove off their moorings. 
</P>
<P>
"I never did that," he said. "I try to concentrate so much on the puck, I'd 
start to lose concentration if I think about that too." 
</P>
<P>
Roy, like most goaltenders, is concerned about players crashing into the goalie 
and turning the crease into a battleground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for the referee to call that, but the NHL has to do something 
before somebody gets hurt," he said. "Guys come down really fast, because they 
know the posts come off pretty easy. I don't know the answer, but I hope they 
find one." 
</P>
<P>
It figures to be easier than finding a way to put the puck past Roy.

CELTICS' MCHALE REDEFINES CONSISTENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER MAY, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several mysterious aspects of this unusual Boston Celtics season will remain 
forever indecipherable. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some constants, and one of them has been the play of Kevin 
McHale. It would be neither outlandish nor naive to suggest that he has been, 
from day one, the most consistent performer on a team riddled with 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, he has shown signs of being the dreaded opponent swallower of 
years past. He is blocking shots as he once did, which is to say, often. He has 
added a three-point shot to his already potent offensive arsenal -- there still 
is no one as adept in the low post -- and he is trailing only deadeye Larry 
Bird in the free-throw race. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin has had an exceptional year," said Celtic Coach Jimmy Rodgers. "He has 
been the epitome of efficiency. He has added a couple new dimensions to his 
game. He really has been solid." 
</P>
<P>
Now, for the first time, the Celtics apparently have started to show something. 
Just what that "something" is cannot be defined and the victims of their recent 
streak are pretty much borderline lottery teams or the New York Knicks, who are 
playing like one. 
</P>
<P>
But the recent streak, seven victories in eight games, has coincided with one 
significant roster move. After the team lost three in a row at home (OK, well 
two in Boston and one in Hartford), Rodgers decided that it was time. McHale, 
who had been the club's primary reliever through 58 games, was to become a 
starter again. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike someone else on the team, McHale has not squawked about his minutes this 
season, although they have been shaved. He has not squawked about his role, 
although that, too, has been altered. 
</P>
<P>
He has resolutely refused to get excited over a good team performance because 
it generally has been followed by one that wasn't so good. One of the more 
clairvoyant statements of the season came from McHale, who ridiculed any 
suggestion that the Celtics had "turned the corner" after playing superbly in 
beating Phoenix on Super Sunday. He was right. Five days later, they lost to 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the Celtics have put together some victories and are in the race 
for the Atlantic Division title. Bird has picked up his game, most noticeably 
his shooting. And McHale? He has been a certifiable monster since taking over 
the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
He now is playing the minutes he used to play -- 39.8 a game as a starter -- 
after averaging almost 31 as a sub. In the eight games, he is averaging 27 
points, as opposed to 19.5 as a reserve. He is shooting 68.8% from the field 
after going 52.2% as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
You want rebounds? He had 13 against the Knicks last Saturday and 13 against 
the Cleveland Cavaliers. In this eight-game run, he's hauling down 9.4 a game. 
As a reserve, it was 7.8. And blocked shots? Glad you asked. As a sub, McHale 
rejected 1.7. In the last eight games, he has been a one-man swat crew, turning 
away 19. He had five against Cleveland and four against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Knicks, he had a slow start and finished with 27 points and 13 
rebounds. He had a big hoop down the stretch to thwart a Knicks rally. He 
blocked a Kenny Walker shot after New York pulled within three. He even took on 
Patrick Ewing for a while, although that was a losing proposition for most of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches and players often think that whoever starts a game isn't nearly as 
important as who finishes. Never mind that 99% of the time, it's usually the 
same people who do both. 
</P>
<P>
But having McHale as a starter is different because it gives Boston an added 
weapon offensively and defensively. In the last eight games, for instance, the 
Celtics have led after the first quarter in seven (Orlando being the 
exception.) The average lead going into the second quarter was almost eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
And as the season winds down and the serious stuff gears up, it is apparent to 
Rodgers and Co. that McHale had better be on the floor as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Said Trent Tucker, "you heard a lot of stuff earlier this season about McHale 
coming off the bench and the Celtics using a lot of people. Look who's starting 
now?" 
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Chris Ford was asked about McHale being moved into the starting 
five again. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed some more production offensively," Ford said. "The game plan all 
along has been to buy time for Kevin so he would be fresh and ready for the 
playoffs. I don't see anything wrong with his playing long minutes now. He's 
fresh." 
</P>
<P>
This week will tell us a lot about the resiliency of the newest Celtics' 
incarnation. Indiana is no picnic. And Wednesday night in Philadelphia already 
has prompted the following, Kruschevian warning from Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to pound them into the floor. I'm tired of answering questions 
about the Celtics. Not one player, if you match them up, is better (than the 
Sixers)," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Detroit Pistons come to town Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Few could argue that the Celtics appear to be as ready as they have been all 
year to meet the challenge. But no one has to tell McHale that appearance and 
reality often have been irreconcilable adversaries this season. 
</P>
<P>
"No one was satisfied with what we did in the first half of the season," he 
said. "We stunk out a lot of joints. Now, we're getting things going. We know 
we're not going to win every game, but if we can play well and continue to 
improve, we'll be going into the playoffs on a high. And that's what you want."

BEING A SPORTS DOCTOR IS QUITE AN OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Joe Namath's knees. Tommy John's elbow. Dave Dravecky's cancer. 
</P>
<P>
They've all been dramatic stories of courage, watched closely by sports fans 
nationwide. And in no small way, high-profile cases like these have been both 
the cause and the result of an explosion in the field of sports medicine over 
the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, 470 team doctors gathered in Scottsdale, Ariz., for the second of 
three annual sports medicine seminars, with topics ranging from "biomechanics 
of the throwing athlete's shoulder" to "special dietary measures for the 
athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, you'd have been hard-pressed to find such a seminar, or 
enough interested doctors to make it worthwhile, says Dr. John A. Bergfeld, 
team doctor for the Cleveland Browns and co-chairman of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been physicians concentrating in sports medicine in Europe since 
the turn of the century, but not here," Bergfeld said in a recent interview at 
his Cleveland Clinic office. "I'm not sure why, because we're a very 
sports-minded country." 
</P>
<P>
Physicians and trainers have been looking after athletes here for decades, of 
course. But sports doctors in the United States didn't begin comparing notes 
regularly until the mid-1960s, when Namath's gimpy knees focused nationwide 
attention on Dr. James A. Nicholas, the New York Jets' team doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when the term 'sports medicine' was really coined here," Bergfeld said. 
"There was the day-to-day Joe Namath knees story, and then he went to the Super 
Bowl. People began to read that there was this man who was a sports medicine 
specialist, and they started saying, 'Gee, maybe I need a sports specialist."' 
</P>
<P>
In December 1971, The New York Times Sunday magazine published a detailed 
article about Nicholas, giving wide publicity to both the man and his field. In 
it, Nicholas noted that technical literature about sports medicine was almost 
non-existent when he became a sports doctor in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Don O'Donoghue, a teacher at the University of Oklahoma's Medical School, 
had written a textbook on athletic injuries that contained a majority of what 
was known about the discipline at the time, Nicholas said. He told the Times 
that O'Donoghue "has done more for sports medicine than anyone else in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Progress came quickly once doctors began sharing information about 
sports-related injuries. O'Donoghue's pioneering work with ligament damage, 
which Nicholas and others used to revive the careers of scores of professional 
athletes, was followed by a series of successes by Dr. Frank Jobe, who 
succeeded sports medicine pioneer Dr. Robert Kerlan as the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
team doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Jobe refined surgical techniques for repairing torn rotator cuffs, and he also 
received attention for his knee surgeries on basketball players such as Wilt 
Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the single most famous success story in sports medicine was Jobe's 
reconstruction of pitcher Tommy John's elbow in 1975. Jobe took a ligament from 
John's right forearm and used it to rebuild John's injured left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed John won 90 games over the next five years, including three 
seasons with 20 or more wins, and he continued pitching throughout the 1980s. 
His story encouraged other injured athletes to persevere. 
</P>
<P>
"For someone like that to have that operation and win 20 games . . . has done a 
tremendous amount for sports medicine," Tom Candiotti, now a pitcher for the 
Indians, was quoted as saying in 1983. "Someone like me should really be 
grateful for someone like him." 
</P>
<P>
Candiotti underwent an operation similar to John's in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The perception that sports medicine has produced great advances used in other 
medical disciplines is not entirely accurate, Bergfeld said. Arthroscopic 
surgery, for example, is typically thought of as a method used to get athletes 
back in action more quickly, but it is not at all a sports exclusive. It has 
been used for years to treat problems totally unrelated to sports. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the living laboratory provided by sports has made significant 
contributions. Scrutiny of athletes' injured knees and ankles is helping 
doctors better understand joint malfunctions such as arthritis, Bergfeld said, 
and he yearns for the day, maybe 10 years from now, when invention of a 
functional artificial ligament will aid athletes and non-athletes alike. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a greater recognition of the importance of the ligaments of the knee 
joints," he said. "We've learned a lot about physical conditioning that has 
spinoffs for the recreational athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Also, videotaped replays of injuries that seem gory to the general public have 
given doctors insight into the way joints react to stresses. Bergfeld 
frequently watches videos of his patients' injuries, not as a diagnostic tool 
but rather to help determine how they occurred and whether they might have been 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've learned a lot by looking at films of injuries, to see exactly 
what happens to that knee joint when it goes out," Bergfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Replays held a surprise for doctors by revealing that a majority of major knee 
problems occur not because the knee itself is struck, but because the body's 
weight lands off center, or the foot locks in the turf, causing the knee to 
twist. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found that 60 percent of major injuries occur without anybody touching 
the knee," Bergfeld said, noting recent injuries to Los Angeles Clippers' 
forward Ron Harper and Browns' guard Ted Banker as examples. 
</P>
<P>
Bergfeld doesn't wince in sympathetic pain when he watches tapes of his 
patients getting hurt, but he does share the anguish an athlete feels when he 
learns the severity of his condition. It was Bergfeld who first discovered a 
cancerous tumor in Dravecky's arm in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco pitcher finally retired after his surgically repaired arm 
broke during an inspiring comeback attempt last year. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how hard they worked to get where they are and how devastating an 
injury can be psychologically," Bergfeld said. "Dave has great inner strength." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas, Jobe and other orthopedists -- surgeons specializing in muscle and 
joint disorders -- became models for sports medicine in the United States 
during the past two decades. In Europe, by contrast, general practitioners, 
rather than surgeons, took the lead in sports medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to Russia, the sports medicine doctor is a physician, not a 
surgeon," Bergfeld said. "Now, the evolution is occurring here, and primary 
care doctors are getting more and more involved in sports medicine. The Family 
Practice Association now has a sports medicine committee." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, teams today will hire both a generalist and a surgeon. Bergfeld, 
for instance, is the orthopedist for the Cavaliers, whose team physician is Dr. 
John A. Lombardo, a primary care doctor. Lombardo co-chaired the Scottsdale 
seminar with Bergfeld in February. 
</P>
<P>
Bergfeld never envisioned himself as a sports doctor when he was going through 
med school in the early 1960s. He had played football at Temple, however, so he 
readily agreed to be the sideline doctor at Wickliffe High School's football 
games while he was interning at the Cleveland Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
He went into the Navy in 1970 and was appointed the team doctor at the Naval 
Academy, and when he returned to the clinic in 1973, he helped set up its 
sports medicine section. 
</P>
<P>
He became affiliated with the Browns, Indians and Cavaliers in the early 1980s, 
serving as the Browns' team doctor and as the other two teams' orthopedic 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't see the discipline of sports medicine as frivolous at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have recreation," Bergfeld said. "When people go to the football 
game, they enjoy it, and the players are their entertainment. To be able to 
support that makes me feel good. Athletics and recreation are important parts 
of our society."

YOUNG HOCKEY PLAYERS WHO LACK ICE TIME GET ROLLING IN LOMITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Feil grew up in Manhattan Beach, known more for sun and surf than for 
ice-skating rinks. Yet Feil, now 21, developed a passion for hockey as a 
teen-ager. When he couldn't get much time on the ice to play his favorite 
sport, he took to the streets with a pair of roller skates and a broken stick 
he conned out of the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Playing time is difficult for any youth to find in ice-starved Southern 
California, and when Tom Peffer created the South Bay Roller Hockey League at 
Lomita Recreation Park, he did so with the idea of taking players like Feil off 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Peffer, who owns skating supply stores in Culver City, Harbor City and Lomita, 
watched roller hockey grow so fast in the 1980s that he was constantly fielding 
requests from young customers for information on roller hockey leagues. To his 
surprise, Peffer found none, so he took matters into his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have so many kids ask me where they could play," he said. "They needed a 
place to play. They wanted a league with stats. No one had organized a thing 
like that before." 
</P>
<P>
Hockey purists may find the "rink" (a converted basketball court) at Lomita 
Park an abominable place to play, but most of the players say that in balmy 
Southern California you take your hockey any way you can get it. 
</P>
<P>
The league has grown so large that city officials have undertaken a study to 
determine what to do with Peffer's burgeoning enterprise. Currently, he 
operates under a gentlemen's agreement with city officials, who seem to like 
the fact that he is offering youths an alternative to street play. 
</P>
<P>
Said City Manager Walker Ritter: "Any program that puts young people . . . off 
the street in a supervised program is worth looking into. That's what we are 
here for." 
</P>
<P>
The city could incorporate the hockey league into its regular recreation 
program, require Peffer to get a permit or halt play altogether. A decision 
should come around the middle of May, Ritter said. 
</P>
<P>
"This started (small), but it has gotten to the point where it's more than just 
a couple of kids playing there now," he said. "We are studying it." 
</P>
<P>
Peffer, who contends that he is offering a community service, is going ahead 
with plans for his spring leagues. He is expanding to offer a six-team youth 
league for the first time, and, because many of his young customers in the 
early 1980s are now in their early 20s, his adult program has grown to 12 
teams. Both leagues are scheduled to start April 22. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Peffer was busy at work at the park, helping to install new boards 
and seal cracks in the concrete of the converted basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
"We are upgrading the park," Peffer said. "Our work is free to the park. It's a 
benefit to the community, and we are happy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Park Director Jerry Summers said the city often accepts free services for 
Lomita Park. He said Peffer's contribution will help "alleviate hazardous 
conditions" at the playing facility, which at 60 by 120 feet measures smaller 
than a standard ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
Roller hockey is popular, said Peffer, because it is far less costly than ice 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
"My intentions were to keep kids off the streets, and to do that you have to 
keep the cost down," he said. A complete ice hockey outfit and league fees run 
about $1,200 a year, he said, while his youth league costs each player about 
$80 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Peffer said about 60% of the young players in the league will be local 
residents. A team of ice hockey players from the Bay-Harbor Ice Arena is 
expected to enter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the adult league, Peffer charges $50 per player per season. He has taken 
out an insurance policy against injuries in both leagues. Each team, limited to 
10 players, must supply its own uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the rules of ice hockey apply to roller hockey, but instead of a puck, 
the league uses a frozen rubber ball. (Last Sunday a swift wrist shot sent the 
ball over the 10-foot fence that encloses the playing surface.) Players are not 
allowed to advance the ball in their hands, but, because it is so bouncy, they 
often block the ball with their gloved palms. 
</P>
<P>
Players wear roller skates or the more advanced roller blades, which resemble 
ice skates but have a single row of wheels instead of a blade. Goalies are 
allowed to wear tennis shoes and a baseball glove on their non-stick hand. Only 
five players are allowed on the surface at any time, one less than in ice 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Peffer has had little trouble attracting teams. They come from as far away as 
the San Fernando Valley. Last week, the captain of a team from Beverly Hills 
was at the park checking out the action. 
</P>
<P>
"There just isn't enough ice time available, and it is costly," explained Feil, 
who now lives in Hermosa Beach. "This is just a way to enjoy playing hockey, 
and it is fun." 
</P>
<P>
Feil's team, the Beach City Bruins, faces off at 11 a.m. today against the 
South Bay Blackhawks in the fifth and deciding game of the winter championship 
series. It has been as spirited a series as anyone could expect in ice hockey. 
Two weeks ago the Blackhawks won the first two games, but last Sunday the 
Bruins fought back to tie the series at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, most of the Bruins have never played ice hockey, said Feil, who 
scored several goals with some neat stick handling last Sunday. He began 
playing street hockey in tennis shoes when he was 14 and graduated to roller 
skates as his interest grew. 
</P>
<P>
"Only two guys out of 10 on our team ever tried ice hockey," said Feil, "and 
that (experience) was pretty limited." 
</P>
<P>
On any given Sunday during league play, the action is quick, said Steve 
Trudnowski, the league's promoter. The smaller dimensions and makeshift 
conditions of the rink challenge participants to stay on their skates. A hip 
check here could grind you into a chain-link fence. Bodies hit the concrete 
regularly in the fight for the ball. Goalies have been knocked through the 
tiny, portable nets they attempt to protect. 
</P>
<P>
But judging by the size of last weekend's crowd, roller hockey has found a hub 
in Lomita. More than 100 people lined the court, many putting up folding chairs 
in the adjacent parking lot to get a good look at the action. 
</P>
<P>
"This really isn't a good turnout," said Trudnowski. "When we have eight or 
nine teams playing during the regular (season), this place is packed." 
</P>
<P>
Loyal spectators are fixtures here. Said Herb Kosmen of Lomita: "This is the 
best entertainment in town. You can't find another sport with this much 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Trudnowski and Puffer hired Kosmen to enclose the court with boards and fill in 
the cracks. Last Thursday he could be seen scurrying around the facility 
directing a work crew. Summers was there, observing for the city. The erection 
of boards around the former basketball court has taken away some of the rink's 
charm, but it will certainly do away with the dangers of a chain-link check. 
</P>
<P>
If the city agrees to let the league continue playing at Lomita Park, Peffer 
has offered to maintain the court. He pointed out that the pair of rusty, bent, 
netless basketball hoops that hang over the goalie boxes have not been 
maintained by the city for years. 
</P>
<P>
During the playoffs last week, some of the fans really got into the action. 
When a player missed a slap shot, one disgusted follower bellowed: "Come on, 
guys. Play the ball!" 
</P>
<P>
It didn't sound anything like hockey terminology, but, then, this is Southern 
California, where fanatics take their hockey any way they can get it.

ELWAY OPTIMISTIC DESPITE A SEASON RIFE WITH TURMOIL; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: DENVER QUARTERBACK MAKING PLANS FOR A FOURTH TRY AT A SUPER BOWL 
CHAMPIONSHIP RING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Indianapolis Colt running back Eric Dickerson is threatening to retire unless 
he is traded, Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino is asking to be traded and 
Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham is pondering retirement after 
two more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Denver Bronco quarterback John Elway quietly has been making plans 
of his own. Elway, no stranger to adversity himself with three Super Bowl 
losses, intends to play next season for . . . the Broncos. And he intends to 
finish his career with . . . the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Elway doesn't want out of Denver; he just wants another chance at the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Elway, the former Granada Hills High star, has spent the two months after the 
Broncos' third Super Bowl wipeout in four years at his recently purchased 
condominium in Palm Springs. He has stayed away from the spotlight to avoid 
controversy and has reveled in the lack of attention. 
</P>
<P>
What Elway has discovered in his seclusion is that there is life after the 
Super Bowl -- even after a humbling 55-10 defeat to the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Elway has had time to re-energize and reflect. He has spent time with his 
family and has played golf at least four times a week. "I've been shooting in 
the 70s," Elway said. "I'm a six-handicap. But I don't have any aspirations of 
playing on the Seniors Tour." 
</P>
<P>
And two months away from Denver has given Elway an optimistic outlook. Leading 
the Broncos in 1990 is something he wants, not dreads. But he recognizes that 
it won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
For all the yardage -- 21,303 -- he has passed for in seven seasons with the 
Broncos, for all his awards, Elway's status as one of the NFL's top performers 
has been tarnished because he has been shut out in the all-important category 
of Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the real bottom line," Elway said. "It doesn't matter what your stats 
are or what you've done. It's how many Super Bowls you've won. Every time you 
lose the Super Bowl, the monkey on your back gets bigger. And the monkey gets 
even bigger when you've been blown out in three of them." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Elway does not look back ruefully at 1989. He acknowledges that he 
probably played the best game of his life in Denver's win over the Cleveland 
Browns in the AFC championship game (385 yards passing, three touchdowns, 39 
yards rushing), but that was quickly forgotten after Super Bowl XXIV. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great year for us," Elway said. "We were just coming off an 8-8 
season and had 19 new faces out of 45. That was a big turnover. We went to two 
Super Bowls (XXI and XXII) and then went 8-8 and were getting old. We made some 
changes and made some cuts that not everyone liked. 
</P>
<P>
"We were projected to finish in the middle of the pack and were 11-5 in the 
regular season and finished 13-6. It was a great year. We have to keep things 
in perspective. We were projected to go 6-10." 
</P>
<P>
Thoughts of the Super Bowl indignity, however, have not gone away. Elway never 
got his rhythm, appeared jittery and completed only 10 of 26 passes for 108 
yards and threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a day that goes by that I haven't thought about (the Super Bowl)," 
Elway said. "It's frustrating. It's also a situation where there's nothing you 
can do about it. It's not like I threw a last-minute interception. We didn't 
even have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Elway took considerable heat from the media last season when his individual 
stats began to fall. After leading the team to a 6-2 start, Elway returned the 
fire in a Sports Illustrated story, telling the magazine the media's criticism 
had gone out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Elway reacted heatedly to innuendoes that he had a drinking problem and stories 
about his media relations (not that great) and gratuities (not that great). 
Furthermore, the length of his hair and size of his teeth were subject to open 
discussion and dissection. The Bronco quarterback told Sports Illustrated that 
he was suffocating under the intense scrutiny and was "sick of it." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Elway, John's father and a former Cal State Northridge and Stanford 
football coach, applauded John for taking the offensive. "I thought (the 
criticism) was unjust, unfair and untrue," Jack Elway said. "I think it was 
good for him mentally to express his thoughts. I thought he handled himself 
real well and said it like it was." 
</P>
<P>
But despite winning more games (he is 70-36-1, a .660 winning percentage) than 
any active quarterback except Joe Montana, Elway says he expects criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes with the territory," Elway said. "There's no quarterback in the game 
that hasn't taken criticism. You look at Joe Montana. They were all over him 
before this year. You get paid to play, but you also get paid to take that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Elway realizes that it's a far different situation from his years with Granada 
Hills and Stanford. Although he failed to lead Granada Hills to a City Section 
football title and never took Stanford to a bowl game, he has received 
considerable plaudits. He was Parade magazine's top prep quarterback for the 
1978 season and finished second in the Heisman Trophy balloting behind Herschel 
Walker in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at his high school days, Elway said, "I think at that level it's still 
a game. It's different in pro ball because of the expectations. You're getting 
paid now and the expectations rise accordingly to what you get paid. That makes 
it tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, you're still a kid and still able to have fun. If you don't 
win, the world doesn't stop turning." 
</P>
<P>
Elway, who makes $2.1 million annually, can empathize with the plight of 
Dickerson and Marino, both of whom perform with great expectations. But he does 
not sympathize. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those guys are just blowing smoke," Elway said. "Dan must want to get 
out of there, but he's not going to. Dickerson, if he retires, he'd have to pay 
back a million dollars (to the Colts). 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets closer to the season, they'll be right there." 
</P>
<P>
Elway remains upbeat about the upcoming season, expecting the Broncos to 
maintain their competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"We need help in some areas," Elway said. "We need a couple receivers, we need 
a big fullback, we're young in the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got good players but need some great players, some big-play guys. We'll 
be right in the hunt again." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, optimism reigns under the Palm Springs sun. Elway said that even the 
prospect of his turning 30 on June 18 is no cause for worry. "I'm just glad I 
made it that far," he said.

ONCE HARBOR STOPPER JOHN INGRAM GOT SERIOUS, THE BATTERS GOT NERVOUS; 
</P>
<P>
JC BASEBALL: THE FIREBALLING RELIEVER HAS LOST 40 POUNDS AND GAINED A BREAKING 
PITCH AND NEW MATURITY. 
</P>

<P>
While most of his fellow students spent cool summer hours on Southland beaches, 
Harbor College pitcher John Ingram was sweating bullets in Wilmington. It paid 
off. Now the former Leuzinger High School standout is throwing bullets and has 
emerged as Harbor's top reliever. 
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing freshman season in which he seldom played, Ingram 
dedicated every spare moment last summer to baseball. He got into top physical 
shape and mastered a breaking pitch that complements his overpowering fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked his butt off," said Harbor assistant coach Tony Bloomfield, a former 
assistant at the University of Nevada-Reno. "I put him on a strict conditioning 
routine. John worked harder than I think he's ever worked in his life." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram, 20, spent the hot summer days throwing, lifting weights and running. 
Lots of running. The 6-foot-4, 240-pound left-hander lost 40 pounds and 
improved practically every facet of his game. 
</P>
<P>
This season Ingram is the stopper on a club that possesses a remarkably deep 
and solid pitching staff and a 32-3 record (11-0 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's aces include sophomores Jeff Hunter (7-0), Pat Ahearne (7-1), Sky 
Lasowitz (4-0) and Ryan Karp (3-0), as well as freshman Chico Limas (3-0) from 
Banning High. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram has the team's second-best earned-run average (1.85), a 2-0 record and 
four saves. He also has an impressive 31 strikeouts in 24 2/3 innings and a 
perfect 0.00 ERA in the Southern California Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that every time John Ingram takes the mound, the game is over," said 
Bloomfield, an all-state shortstop at Harbor in 1982 and 1983. "He has a lot of 
desire now and a very positive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The second-year assistant coach says that wasn't always the case, however. 
</P>
<P>
"On this team we stress PMA -- positive mental attitude -- and he'd never had 
it," Bloomfield said. "John was always labeled as a lazy person, as a 
non-winner, by (pro) scouts and four-year schools." 
</P>
<P>
Last season Ingram lived up to the bad rap. He seldom went to practice, and 
when he did he lacked motivation and dedication. In addition, Ingram had only 
one weapon, his fastball, which got nailed by opponents in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"(Last season) he didn't pitch much because he was a flake," said Harbor Coach 
Jim O'Brien, who has led the Seahawks to 10 conference championships and two 
state titles in 15 years. "He was overweight, he missed practice and he just 
couldn't get his feet on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the coach said, it was evident that Ingram had great potential. 
He simply needed a push. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone could see the great talent," O'Brien said. "He's a stopper. He's a guy 
that changes games around. This season he's been completely overpowering. We 
clocked him at 88 miles per hour on a slow (radar) gun. He's just a great power 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram doesn't see last season as a waste, though he admits that there was a 
problem, one he can't seem to pinpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I just wasn't as serious about it," he said last week while watching 
the team stretch before practice. "I didn't work as hard, and I just did what I 
had to do to get by. I was also real up-tight. This year I'm loose and I'm 
having a good time because I'm relaxed and calm." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Carol, said a big factor in her son's success is that he has 
matured tremendously in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a changed person," she said. "He's got the winning attitude now. He 
really is on an upward swing." 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, Ingram says, a burning desire to pitch in more games 
inspired his turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bloomfield, not getting drafted at the end of last season was 
Ingram's biggest motivator. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's what really brought him down to earth," Bloomfield said. "He 
was drafted by the (Milwaukee) Brewers out of high school, and he didn't get 
drafted last year. No one really looked at him, and I think that really got to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's offer in 1987 was far from spectacular. Ingram said the Brewers 
offered him $2,500 to sign with their farm team. Another option was attending 
Cal State Fullerton, but his high school grades weren't up to par. 
</P>
<P>
"I was young and ignorant," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
At Leuzinger, the burly pitcher had "K," the symbol for strikeout, shaved into 
the side of his head. Ingram was the team's most valuable pitcher in 1986 and 
1987, helping the Olympians reach the playoffs both years. As a senior he had a 
16-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram also played two seasons in the Connie Mack amateur baseball league for 
premier high school players and collegiate underclassmen. In 1987 he led his 
club to a second-place finish at the Continental Connie Mack World Series in 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
However, that same year Ingram experienced a great loss. Three days after 
Leuzinger's last CIF game, the school's baseball coach, Dennis Bowman, died of 
a heart attack while playing golf in Long Beach. He was 41. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it real hard," Ingram said softly while tugging on his blue baseball 
cap. "I just couldn't believe it. I still don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Ingram said Bowman's death is the hardest thing her son has experienced. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny was very close to him," she said. "It was very difficult for him. 
Bowman was the only other male role model in his life besides his father, and 
he was very attached to him." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram, who lives in Hawthorne with his parents, had nowhere to compete after 
high school, so he enrolled at El Camino College. He transferred to Harbor 
after redshirting in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't happy (at El Camino)," Ingram said. "I can't really pinpoint 
what exactly it was, but I was very unhappy, so I called Coach O'Brien." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram likes his role at Harbor, although it lacks the glamour of the starting 
position he had in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm a stopper," he said, "and I love that thrill. When the game is on the 
line, it's on your shoulders, and I know I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore catcher Gus Mungaray says Ingram has good reason to be confident. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't worry about what he's doing now," Mungaray said. "He just does it. 
He just throws real hard. Sometimes, against the weaker teams, you can tell 
guys are scared when they come up to the plate. They just don't want to be up 
there against John's pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram plans to compete at a four-year college next season unless he gets a 
good pro offer. He said Fullerton and Cal State Northridge have shown interest, 
as have the Houston Astros.

CSUN LOSES, KEEPS HOPING FOR BERTH IN VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>

<P>
A pot of playoff gold awaited the Cal State Northridge men's volleyball team 
when it played host to fifth-rated Hawaii on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of the match with the Rainbows, the pot was empty. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was rebuffed for the second consecutive night in its attempt to 
secure its first Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. postseason tournament 
berth, losing this time to Hawaii in four games. Hawaii won, 13-15, 15-5, 
15-11, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors (11-9, 6-7 in conference play), who remained in second place in 
the DeGroot Division, will try again Wednesday to clinch a tournament berth 
when they travel to the University of Santa Barbara. Only the top three teams 
in each of the two WIVA divisions advance to the postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We made too many mistakes," Northridge Coach John Price said. "They're strong 
and they're good jumpers. There just weren't a lot of places for us to go as 
attackers." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge started well enough against Hawaii's all-senior lineup, getting 
eight kills each from Coley Kyman and Neil Coffman in taking the first game. 
The game was tied six times, and CSUN weathered six net violations before Kyman 
took a Gary Reznick set and sent the game-winning kill down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-ranked Matadors, who have three WIVA matches left, trailed just, 4-3, 
in Game 2 before Hawaii (15-7, 10-4) scored 11 of the next 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow roll continued in the third game as Hawaii raced to a 7-0 
advantage. The lead swelled to 10-1 before Northridge made a run, closing 
within 11-8 behind Kyman, who had eight kills in the game and 27 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The teams split the next six points, and Hawaii took the game when Damien Hardy 
stuffed Raphael Tulino's kill attempt for a point. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which lost its third consecutive match, scored the first point of 
Game 3 on a net violation, but Hawaii, currently in fourth place in the Wilson 
Division, ran off the next eight to assume control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman finished with 23 kills for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Briceno had 27 kills for Hawaii and Adam Lockwood added 22.

POROUS PALOS VERDES LOSES TO ALEMANY, 11-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RAATZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes Coach Gil Eberhardt had a succinct description for Saturday's 11-7 
loss to Alemany in the Palos Verdes-Redondo Tournament at Redondo Union High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a poor outing," he said with a laugh after the Sea Kings (8-5) committed 
eight errors and left 12 runners on base. The errors led to four unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes starter Jason Goldberg, coming off a complete-game win in his last 
outing, was given a 2-0 first-inning lead. But he couldn't make it out of the 
second, walking five of the 10 batters he faced in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Jud Sanford relieved Goldberg with two outs and the bases loaded in the second. 
Left-fielder Kirk Fellows greeted him with a two-run double. An error let in 
two more runs, giving the Indians (7-7) a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings tied the game at 4-4 on Goldberg's third-inning double. 
</P>
<P>
Despite getting two walks and three stolen bases, Palos Verdes failed to score 
in the fourth inning as Alemany reliever Greg Thompson, who started the game at 
shortstop, pitched out of the jam. Thompson, who picked up his first win, went 
four innings, giving up six hits and three runs. 
</P>
<P>
After the Indians scored twice in their half of the fifth to take the lead for 
good, the Sea Kings loaded the bases with one out in the the bottom half. But 
left-fielder Tom Hein grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been hitting well all year," said Eberhardt, whose team had nine hits. 
"We didn't take advantage of our chances today." 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes attack was led by Goldberg (two hits, three RBIs), 
center-fielder Doug Kay (two hits, three runs) and first baseman Pat O'Hara 
(two hits, two RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste 7, West Torrance 0 -- Pitchers Chris Hubbard and Jason Mavar combined 
on a three-hitter, and Mike Ryan and Greg Keese each hit two-run homers to lead 
the Marauders in the consolation quarterfinals of the Palos Verdes/Redondo 
Tournament at Miraleste. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, a left-hander, had not allowed a hit when he was pulled after the 
second inning because he had reached the 10-inning pitching limit for the week. 
Mavar, a right-hander, gave up three hits and struck out 11 in the last five 
innings to improve to 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste (10-2) was ahead 3-0 when it scored four runs in the fifth on home 
runs by Ryan and Keese. Ryan also doubled in the game. Mavar was two for four 
with an RBI. The Marauders resume play Monday with a non-league game at South 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
West fell to 5-7.

MACK TO COACH ST. BONAVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jon Mack, Loyola High's track and field coach who also has coached at Alemany 
and Notre Dame, has been hired to coach football at St. Bonaventure in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Bonaventure job opened when Damian Wilkerson resigned at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Mack has compiled a 63-15-1 record in track since 1982 when he took over the 
Notre Dame job as a 20-year-old college student. Mack, 29, who also worked as 
an assistant football coach at Notre Dame, joined the Alemany staff in 1988 and 
served as track coach and a football assistant. He has filled the same posts 
since joining the Loyola staff last fall.

El Camino Real High left-hander Ryan McGuire concedes it is unlikely that he 
will ever pitch better than he did during his 20-strikeout performance in 
Tuesday's 7-2 defeat of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
After all, 20 strikeouts in seven innings doesn't leave a lot of room for 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how I can," McGuire said. "I was extraordinarily lucky. I was 
throwing my fastball for strikes, the curveball was right where I wanted it and 
the third pitch was working too." 
</P>
<P>
Yet if McGuire wants to claim, or perhaps reclaim, the seven-inning City 
Section record, he might need to raise his performance a notch. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, right-hander Bob Henriksen of Hollywood High struck out 21 in a 
seven-inning, 1-0 loss to Fairfax in 1939, according to teammate Howard 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the Hollywood High yearbook says that Henriksen's mark eclipsed 
state and national records at the time. Yet Henriksen's performance was news to 
Cal-Hi Sports magazine, which keeps a log of all state marks. The City Section 
keeps no records on individual statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll check it out," said Cal-Hi's Mark Tennis, whose record book indicates 
that McGuire was the first City pitcher to record 20 or more strikeouts in a 
seven-inning game. "If it's true, we'll recognize it. Yearbooks are always kind 
of iffy, though." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson recalled that Henriksen allowed "five hits or so." McGuire allowed 
five hits against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"He was bigger than most of us and he threw pretty hard," Anderson said of 
Henriksen. "Most of us were about 5-9 or 5-10 back then, and he was 6-2 or 6-3. 
He blew people away." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who said he started at second base in the 21-strikeout game, said 
Henriksen was signed by the Chicago Cubs but threw out his arm during his first 
season of professional ball. 
</P>
<P>
Add record: According to Cal-Hi, the state and Southern Section record for a 
seven-inning game was set in 1973 by Jim Peterson of La Habra Sonora. Peterson 
struck out 22, with one batter reaching base on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
The national record for a seven-inning game was set in 1986 by Brett Jennings 
of Lingleville, Tex. Jennings struck out 24 in a game against Santo, Tex. Also 
included on the national list are Vida Blue and Scott Garrelts; each struck out 
21 in seven-inning games. 
</P>
<P>
Cal-Hi's records indicate that the single-game City mark was set in 1949 by 
Paul Pettit of Narbonne. Pettit struck out 27 Banning batters in a 12-inning 
game. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring Cleveland's leadoff batter on a ground ball to second, McGuire 
(2-0) recorded the final 20 outs via strikeout. He walked one. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, a 6-2 senior who will play next season at UCLA, has 45 strikeouts in 
20 1/3 innings and an earned-run average of 1.03. 
</P>
<P>
Looooong ball: There is no outfield fence at Lanark Park, Canoga Park's home 
field. Consequently, outfielders can play as deep as they dare. 
</P>
<P>
When San Fernando Coach Steve Marden saw where the Canoga Park left fielder was 
playing Tiger slugger John Najar in a game at Lanark last week, he thought it 
was extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember thinking, 'That's outrageous,' " said Marden, who said that the 
Canoga Park player was standing in the middle of an adjacent softball field. 
"The guy was on the back edge of the infield dirt of the softball field. If he 
turns around, he's their second baseman." 
</P>
<P>
During the at-bat in question, Najar strode to the plate with the bases loaded. 
Since everyone figured Najar could not hit the ball over the left fielder, 
Marden said he told Najar to "choke up and make contact, just try to drive the 
ball somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Coach. 
</P>
<P>
Najar not only pulled the ball over the left fielder's head, he almost slammed 
it out of sight. The ball hit a fence near the softball backstop in left field 
that Marden estimated is 450 to 480 feet from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park had the last laugh, however. Because the outfielder played so deep, 
Najar was held to a three-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
Put a dent in it: Najar's Lanark Park poke might not have been his most 
memorable blast of last week. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, in a 17-6 defeat of Canoga Park at San Fernando, Najar's home 
run, his fifth, cleared the fence in left and landed on a Suzuki Samurai 
belonging to Tiger assistant Abel Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
"Good thing it was a ragtop," Marden said. "That's a dent, otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Up-and-coming: Previously known for his exploits in cross-country and at two 
miles in track, Obed Aguirre of San Fernando is quickly establishing himself at 
shorter distances. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Aguirre placed third in the 1,600 meters in the Pasadena Games at 
Occidental College. His time of 4 minutes 15.19 seconds (it converts to a 
4:16.70 mile) was more than 11 seconds off his previous best and broke the 
school record in the mile (4:20.2) set by Tim Roelen in 1957 when he won the 
state title. 
</P>
<P>
"Obed ran well, but he's capable of running a lot faster before the season is 
over," San Fernando Coach Ken Kohon said. "I watched the videotape of the race 
and Obed really wasn't that tired after he finished. I think he's capable of 
running under 4:10 in the 1,600 and under 8:50 in the 3,200 in the right race." 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre will not have to wait long for ideal competition. He is scheduled to 
run in the 3,200 in the Arcadia Invitational on Saturday, and Agoura's Bryan 
Dameworth is expected to head the field. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth won the Kinney national cross-country title in December and placed 
second (9:00.27) in the 3,200 in the state track meet in June. 
</P>
<P>
Roster addition: Woodland Hills West, the defending American Legion World 
Series champion, has added left-hander Joey Rosselli to its roster for the 
summer, Coach Don Hornback said. Rosselli, who is 4-1 and batting .500 for 
Alemany, lives in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything works out, that could give us the Valley's best right-hander and 
left-hander," Hornback said. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander is Pat Treend, who is 4-0 for El Camino Real. Both pitchers 
have committed to play next season at Division I schools -- Treend at UC Santa 
Barbara and Rosselli at Arizona State.

THE WIND A WINNER FOR ASTOR; 
</P>
<P>
SAILING: A STRONG WIND BACKED A STRONG PREDICTION BY SKIPPER RICHARD STRAMAN AS 
ASTOR WON THE CLASS 'A' FLEET RACE BY MORE THAN TWO MINUTES OVER DAUNTLESS.

Skipper Richard Straman didn't mean to sound cocky when he proclaimed before 
the fourth America's Schooner Cup: "If it's a windy day, we'll win. Simple as 
that." 
</P>
<P>
It was about that simple Saturday on San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Straman's schooner, Astor, received large doses of wind throughout the day and 
sailed away with the Class 'A' fleet race by more than two minutes over 
Dauntless. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't as windy as we would have liked, but we got all the wind we needed," 
Straman said. 
</P>
<P>
Straman and his 12-man crew will have to root for the wind again as Astor faces 
Dauntless at noon today in a match race for the Schooner Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping it doesn't blow out," Straman said. "It looks like this system 
will hold." 
</P>
<P>
Dauntless, skippered by Paul Plotts, gained the right to meet Astor by virtue 
of its second place finish. Two-time defending champion, Kelpie, would have met 
Astor for the second consecutive year, but structural damage sidelined the 
schooner until next year's race. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what Dauntless' chances were today if the wind held, Straman said: 
"There's not a whole lot they can do. The history has been, whenever the wind's 
up, we beat Dauntless. When it's not, Dauntless wins. Paul's just a great 
light-wind sailor." 
</P>
<P>
Straman said one of the keys to Astor's easy victory, besides the wind, was its 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody else was doing a starboard start, but we did a port start and dove 
across the starting line," Straman said. "We just had a tremendous advantage on 
everybody. And then we just began to pull away." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Straman said his port start was also successful. 
</P>
<P>
"We blew away the field by 16 minutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But after his excellent start, Straman said a tactical error almost let 
Dauntless, the 1987 America's Schooner Cup Champion, back in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a little too conservative about the halfway point and Dauntless started 
gaining on us," Straman said. "In retrospect, we probably should have changed 
sails." 
</P>
<P>
Bagheera, one of the pre-race favorites, finished well back in third place and 
will race today for the consolation title.

BATTLING FOR A PIECE OF THE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At odds over the future of a Pacific Palisades park, environmentalists and a 
synod of the Presbyterian Church have locked horns in a dispute that may now be 
left for the courts to decide. 
</P>
<P>
The Synod of Southern California and Hawaii has filed a lawsuit in a bid to 
force a state agency to build a 48-foot-wide road into Temescal Gateway Park. 
Opponents say the plan would ruin the 20-acre park, which is a favorite of 
hikers. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of road in a park as small as this one is ludicrous," said Carole 
Stevens, chairwoman of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which would be 
required to build the road. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed last month in Los Angeles Superior Court, also names the 
state of California and the Los Angeles Unified School District. The school 
district acquired the property from the synod by condemnation in 1968 to build 
a school there, but later sold it to the conservancy after plans for the school 
were scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, the synod claims that it was given assurances by the school 
district that a road would be built on the property that the synod could share, 
and that the conservancy inherited the obligation to build the road as a 
condition of its purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The park, which is next to synod property at Sunset Boulevard and Temescal 
Canyon Road, is one of the most accessible links to the extensive trail system 
in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, about 750 hikers use the trail, which originates in the park, but 
twists along an easement on synod property for almost a mile before linking up 
with a trail in Topanga State Park and a network of public hiking trails 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"Preserving the integrity of the park is of utmost concern to us," said John 
Diaz, a planner with the conservancy. "Where else can you step off a street bus 
and be at a trail head?" 
</P>
<P>
The synod's opponents have accused church officials of wanting to sacrifice the 
park for the sake of a new Presbyterian Conference Center that the synod has 
long wanted to build and that would be served by the proposed road. 
</P>
<P>
The road would run for a quarter of a mile along the park boundary that abuts 
the synod property, starting at Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials declined comment on the dispute, referring inquiries to an 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"The synod has taken the action that it has in order to get the road it feels 
it is entitled to have," said Bill White, a lawyer for the synod. 
</P>
<P>
White said that the synod had "gone to great lengths" to negotiate a compromise 
with the conservancy and the neighbors over the road and the size of the 
proposed conference center. He said the lawsuit was filed as an act of 
"self-protection" because of the conservancy's plans for a 28-foot-wide roadway 
into the park, which synod officials say is inadequate to help serve the size 
of the conference center they have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The synod, which represents about 300 churches, has for many years operated a 
conference center in several old buildings capable of accommodating 135 guests. 
Some of the Palisades' first permanent structures, a meat market and grocery 
store built in the 1920s, now serve as the center's office and cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
For years, church officials have talked of building a new center to accommodate 
up to 500 guests, and a staff of between 10 and 15 people. However, in January, 
in an apparent bid to mollify neighbors long opposed to the plan, church 
officials voted to reduce the size of the project by half. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have often criticized the synod's plans saying they resemble a major 
hotel development more than a church retreat. Although encouraged by the 
reduced size, neighbors have made it clear they prefer there be no expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't build the kind of center they want without a wider road to satisfy 
fire safety requirements and that sort of thing, and I think that helps to 
explain why the lawsuit was filed," said Frances Shalant, a member of the 
Pacific Palisades Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of her group and two other community groups expressed surprise at the 
timing of the lawsuit, saying that private talks between the neighbors and 
church officials had been going well. 
</P>
<P>
"It was shocking the way they did it," said Diane August, chairwoman of Friends 
of Temescal. "We would like to see them upgrade their property and keep it 
rustic and attractive without expanding, and we thought we were headed in that 
direction until (the lawsuit) occurred." 
</P>
<P>
But White, the synod attorney, said that the synod is eager to make peace with 
its neighbors, despite the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"The synod is interested in protecting its rights (for a road), and has shown 
itself to be environmentally sensitive in the past," he said. "It doesn't feel 
there is anything in what it wants to do that would damage the integrity of the 
park."

EASING OF RENT LAW PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: A RENTERS' RIGHTS GROUP WILL DISCUSS ENDORSING RENT INCREASES FOR 
UNITS VOLUNTARILY VACATED AS WELL AS FOR EXISTING TENANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, the tenants group that gained control of 
the city by getting a tough rent-control ordinance approved in 1979, is now 
scrambling to relax the law to stop a growing number of evictions -- and to 
save its political future. 
</P>
<P>
SMRR members will meet today at 2 p.m. at the Retail Clerk's Hall to decide on 
a series of proposals that would allow some rent increases for existing tenants 
and even larger increases on units voluntarily vacated. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be the most important SMRR meeting in 10 years," said Paul 
Rosenstein, a SMRR steering committee member. "We are proposing some dramatic 
and very substantial changes in rent control." 
</P>
<P>
Brad Jones, co-chairman of SMRR, and Rosenstein said in an interview last week 
that the proposals are designed to discourage landlords from using the 1986 
state Ellis Act, which allows landlords to legally evict tenants and get out of 
the rental housing business. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of more than 1,000 units in Santa Monica have notified the Rent Control 
Board that they intend to evict tenants and go out of business since the law 
was enacted. Landlords have argued that rent control is so restrictive that 
their properties are more valuable vacant than with an apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords said they believe public sentiment has swung against SMRR because of 
the massive evictions, and predict that the November municipal election, when 
three of the seven City Council seats and four of the five rent board seats 
will be up for election, will validate their position. SMRR members occupy the 
majority on both boards. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lambert, an attorney and landlord, said the only way to stop the evictions 
under the Ellis Act is by implementing vacancy decontrol, which would allow 
rents to increase to market levels whenever a unit is voluntarily vacated. An 
initiative petition is being prepared by a group of landlords and some tenants, 
according to Lambert, that would allow a form of vacancy decontrol. 
</P>
<P>
Although SMRR leaders insist they still oppose vacancy decontrol, one of their 
proposals calls for allowing landlords to raise rents a certain percentage or 
dollar amount -- not yet determined -- whenever a unit is voluntarily vacated. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenstein, who said the proposals were developed after discussions with 
landlords, tenants and housing specialists, said the proposals are not a change 
in the group's basic objective of providing affordable housing but an attempt 
to deal with the current housing crisis in a realistic manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Rent control has achieved its major goals in the 1980s, and now changes are 
needed to meet the challenges of the 1990s," he said. "We have to do something 
dramatic because there is no hope for relief in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
Other proposed changes would allow landlords to recoup from existing tenants 
the cost of increased city fees and assessments, and reduce the paper work 
needed to pass on the costs for capital improvements such as a new roof. 
</P>
<P>
The other changes proposed by the group's housing committee would seek to 
establish a fund to subsidize housing for low-income tenants, require a minimum 
level of maintenance from landlords, create anti-harassment measures to protect 
tenants and set up a mediation process to resolve tenant-landlord disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is also recommending that SMRR reverse its position opposing the 
rent board's Incentive Housing Program and encourage participation for at least 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which was adopted on a 3-2 vote in October, allows landlords to 
raise rents by as much as $900 on some units if an equal number of units are 
set aside with rents as low as $274 for very-low-income persons. 
</P>
<P>
Both SMRR and Action, a local landlords group, denounced the program for giving 
the other side too much. 
</P>
<P>
But rent board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis said in interview that it is SMRR 
-- in a desperate effort to save its political future -- that is now giving 
landlords too much. 
</P>
<P>
"With our program we may give up something, but a least we get something back," 
Davis said. "With their proposals we get nothing back. In fact, people who are 
in apartments now are going to have to pay more rent." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said SMRR's proposal to reverse its position on the program is "almost 
laughable." 
</P>
<P>
"They trashed us all summer because they said it was vacancy decontrol," she 
said. "Now they are the ones offering vacancy decontrol. I find it almost 
laughable. But I am very saddened by it. You have a few people who have their 
own political futures in mind offering proposals that will gut rent control 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
Jones denies that the group's motives are political. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost elections before," he said. "Our first and foremost concern is to 
prevent the human tragedy that is taking place" with the growing number of 
evictions. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment owner Lambert, however, is just pleased that SMRR is finally looking 
to provide some financial relief for landlords. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in support of several of the things they are proposing," he said. "They 
are saying that vacancy decontrol in some form is OK. This is what we have been 
telling them for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"What is driving (SMRR) to the negotiation table is the realization that 
restrictive rent control has created the Ellis crisis and they better do 
something to keep the landlords in business. Tenants and landlords are now on 
the same side." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: The tenants' group, Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, was 
instrumental in getting a tough rent-control ordinance approved in Santa Monica 
in 1979. In 1986, the state Legislature passed the Ellis Act, which allows 
landlords to legally evict tenants and get out of the rental housing business. 
Since the law was enacted, owners of more than 1,000 units in the city have 
notified the Rent Control Board that they intend to evict tenants and go out of 
business. SMRR is studying proposals to relax the law to stop a growing number 
of evictions.

VENICE PLAN HAS THE TOWN TALKING -- AND TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Venice crowd was out in force Wednesday night doing what they do best: 
speaking out on their vision -- and their fears -- for the future of their 
colorful oceanside community. 
</P>
<P>
And how they did go on. Sixty-six speakers stepped up to the microphone at an 
almost five-hour public hearing to comment on a long-awaited Los Angeles City 
Planning Department draft of a land-use plan for the Venice coastal area. About 
150 members of the community attended the hearing at the Venice High School 
auditorium, sometimes cheering, sometimes jeering and frequently being reminded 
by the hearing officer that their reaction impinged on the speaking time 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers, a veritable "Who's Who" of Venice activists, spoke on everything 
from how long it would take a developer to get a project approved to feeling 
like a local endangered bird, the least tern, that has no place to nest. At 
least no place he can afford. "Whenever I look for a place to land, I can't 
find one," the man lamented. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents the area, and several of her 
staff attended the hearing. So did Mary Lee Gray, County Supervisor Deane 
Dana's deputy, who may have her eye on Galanter's council seat. Activist Jerry 
Rubin testified about why the down-and-out Venice Pavilion should be rescued. 
Venice Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Marge Alatorre said it should be 
razed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the president of the slow-growth Venice Town Council nor the president 
of the more development-oriented Venice Action Committee was happy with the 
preliminary draft of the land-use plan. 
</P>
<P>
There were, in fact, few kudos for the report that set out a number of broad, 
philosophical policy goals for Venice's future. Most speakers called for a 
delay of its approval or its withdrawal until its shortcomings can be 
addressed. The land use plan will be coupled with a more detailed 
implementation plan that is not yet completed. 
</P>
<P>
Like a persistent drumbeat, the recurring issues that arouse the Venice 
community reverberated through the public testimony: gentrification, affordable 
housing, beach access, traffic and, as always, parking, parking, parking. 
</P>
<P>
"No one but my Domino's deliveryman can seem to find parking within three 
blocks of my apartment," said Phil Hopkins. Or as architect Jonathan Hankin put 
it: "As residents, we are basically held hostage for fear of losing our parking 
places on the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the Venice Town Council made a plea to the Planning 
Department to consider making use of a provison of the Coastal Act that they 
said can protect any one beach from being inundated beyond its capacity. As 
Southern California's No. 2 tourist attraction after Disneyland, Venice beach 
qualifies as a beach that draws more people than it can actually handle, they 
said.

"North Venice is probably the most congested area of the entire California 
coast, yet the land use plan is written as if North Venice is a lonely, 
deserted private beach that needs more attractions to get more people here," 
Nancy Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
Protesting the continued commercialization of Ocean Front Walk, Kent said the 
law protects people's rights to "go to the beach, not their right to shop at 
the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Another property owner suggested following the lead of his hometown of Newport 
Beach by instituting permit parking throughout the area and standing firm. 
"Over the course of time, we won't have a tourism problem," Joe Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the panoply of opinions, there was one recurring complaint: The Planning 
Department had not adequately reflected community input from a series of 1988 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter joined the chorus, urging the Planning Department to bring the 
preliminary plan back to the community before sending it to the Planning 
Commission for review, as is the department's normal practice. 
</P>
<P>
The state-mandated coastal plan originated with the 1976 Coastal Act. The 
Venice plan got under way in the early 1980s but was tabled in 1983 when the 
city and the Coastal Commission failed to reach accord; Galanter restarted the 
process in mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a series of 27 workshops drew more than 1,000 Venice residents, who 
gave their vision for the community. A related group of study groups met during 
the same time period and relayed their findings to the larger group. 
</P>
<P>
Then, according to Jim Bickhart, Galanter's planning deputy, progress on the 
plan was stymied for nine months because of staffing changes in the Planning 
Department. The community, meanwhile, waited for a response. 
</P>
<P>
Bickhart said he felt some of the community's current upset stemmed from a 
mistaken notion that their contributions would be in the umbrella document 
released 20 days ago, rather than in the detailed companion documents that are 
yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter and Bickhart were criticized because they were blamed for the 
inclusion in the plan of a proposal made by a private nonprofit group. The 
group, the Venice Resources Corp., headed by former Venice Town Council 
President Dell Chumley, is seeking funds to start a beach shuttle. Its proposed 
route is included in the plan, which critics viewed as an endorsement of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Bickhart has contributed money to the Venice Resources Corp., although he said 
his check was never cashed. Both he and Galanter insisted that there is nothing 
wrong with the contribution, one of many Bickhart said he makes to community 
groups, including the Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
"He's free to do whatever he wants with his money," said Galanter outside the 
hearing, and denied having anything to do with getting the group's proposal 
into the plan.

UNION'S ENDORSEMENTS CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of West Hollywood city workers has accused leaders of the city employee 
union of improperly throwing union support in the April 10 City Council 
elections to a slate of candidates that includes one aspirant whose campaign is 
being managed by a union vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The critics went public last week after the city employees' chapter of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, representing 
about 90 workers, sent out an aggressive citywide mailer attacking incumbent 
Councilman John Heilman and urging voters to support candidates Sal Guarriello, 
Babette Lang and Stephen Martin. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer prompted several city employees to accuse union leaders of acting 
without a full vote of the rank and file. The employees specifically criticized 
union vice president Dennis Orfirer, who they said has a conflict of interest 
on the matter because he is Guarriello's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems strange that they are not aware that this is a conflict of interest," 
said David Scott, an assistant to the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials accused their critics of belonging to a fringe group of 
disgruntled Heilman supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have are a couple of people who are friends of John Heilman who are 
trying to make trouble," said Orfirer, a hearing examiner for the rent 
stabilization department. "The union membership is strongly behind the 
endorsements." 
</P>
<P>
Orfirer said his position as campaign manager for Guarriello does not represent 
a conflict for most union members. "I made it clear that I represented him," he 
said. "Besides, the vote was so overwhelming that it wouldn't have made any 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
He said that all members of AFSCME Local 3339 were invited to attend a meeting 
in February at which five of the nine candidates competing for three open seats 
were interviewed for endorsements. After the interviews, those in attendance 
voted to recommend Guarriello, Lang and Martin for endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
The union's executive board officially approved the recommendation a couple of 
days later. "It was a very open process," Orfirer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics of the selection, who say they represent about 25 employees, 
contend that even though they were all invited to the candidate interviews, it 
was never explained that an endorsement vote would take place at the end of the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Many more people would have come to the meeting had they known they would be 
voting to endorse candidates," said Wayne H. Zimmerman, an analyst for the 
city's Department of Public Works. By the time the vote was taken, he said, the 
audience had dwindled to about a dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
Orfirer replied that "the word vote may not have been used, but the overall 
context of the message was that a selection was going to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, the outcome of the balloting would not have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot at stake," he said. "John Heilman has been a thorn in our side, 
he's virulently anti-labor. Over the last few years he has taken numerous 
anti-labor positions." 
</P>
<P>
The union, he said, raised dues last year as part of an effort to become more 
aggressive in supporting candidates for the council campaign. Thus far, the 
funds have been used to support citywide mailings. The first mailing introduced 
the union-supported candidates, the second specifically targeted Heilman. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't believe him!" the letter's cover read. Inside it says: "John Heilman 
says you must reelect him to protect our strong rent control law. . . . 
'Baloney!' says AFSCME, the city employees union." The letter goes on to 
reiterate the union's endorsement of Guarriello, Lang and Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the union-supported candidates, Guarriello and Lang, along with Heilman, 
have also been endorsed by the Coalition for Economic Survival, the renters' 
group that has generally dominated city politics since West Hollywood 
incorporated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Lang and Heilman are running a joint campaign. Guarriello has run an 
independent campaign, occasionally taking aim at Heilman's record. 
</P>
<P>
Guarriello accuses Heilman and the coalition of orchestrating the current flap 
over his union endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition is trying to make a big deal out of this," Guarriello said. "We 
are running a clean, clean, squeaky clean campaign. CES is creating the 
problems, and it's Heilman's camp." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Heilman contends that he is not anti-union and that the uproar 
signals that he still has support among the union's rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
"They can say I'm anti-union but it doesn't make it so," he said. "The truth is 
I'm not going to be their puppet and do what they tell me to do every time they 
ask for an increase."

Photo, Slip-Splash He Was Taking a Bath: While searching for tadpoles recently 
in a shallow pond at Douglas Park in Santa Monica, 8-year-old Erik Beck got a 
closer, wetter look than he wanted. He slipped, sprawled, splashed and 
generally got soaked. The pond's bottom was slick with moss, making it 
difficult for his friend Pedro Sanchez, 7, to reach Erik and pull him ashore. 
Eventually, they summoned Erik's mother, Elizabeth Holycross, who managed to 
get a grip on her son and drag him back to the rocky shoreline. JEROME HENKEL /

American politics is getting weird. In Texas, a candidate for Tarrant County 
(Fort Worth) judge died of a heart attack in January, too late to have his name 
removed from the March primary ballot. His opponent did what he called the 
"morally decent thing" and refused to campaign against a dead man. He lost. 
</P>
<P>
Texans also nominated Warren G. Harding Jr. for state comptroller, Buster Brown 
for attorney general and Gene Kelly -- who spent little money and had no 
visible campaign -- for a seat on the state Supreme Court. Kelly's opponent, an 
Appeals Court judge who spent more than $300,000 on his campaign, remarked 
afterward, "If I had been Fred Astaire, I might have won." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strangest outcome occurred in the race for Harris County (Houston) 
Democratic Party chairman. Two candidates qualified for the runoff. One is 
Kenneth Bentsen Jr., an investment banker and nephew of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen 
(D-Tex.), the 1988 Democratic nominee for vice president of the United States. 
The other is Leslie Elaine Perez, a transsexual and convicted murderer who 
spent seven years in prison -- as a man -- and was once on death row. 
</P>
<P>
In the March 13 primary, Perez did well enough among gay and Latino voters to 
qualify for the runoff. She could become the first killer transsexual to hold a 
major party office. "Leslie is a Democrat working in the party," the current 
county chairman said. "She's not a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but a lot of people think American politics is becoming a joke. And 
a pretty nasty one at that. 
</P>
<P>
Even the hardened voters of Texas were shocked by the mean-spiritedness of this 
year's campaign. Democratic candidates for governor tried to outdo each other 
proclaiming devotion to the death penalty. One ran a TV commercial that showed 
him strolling in front of gigantic mug shots of criminals executed while he was 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate refused to answer the question of whether she had ever used 
illegal drugs. Instead, she ran ads saying her opponents had "the worst resumes 
money can buy." 
</P>
<P>
A candidate in a state senate race accused his opponent of murder because his 
law firm had defended a nursing home that was sued for negligence. The TV ad 
showed a patient's tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
In another race, a state senator was called a "political prostitute" for 
insurance companies and accused of beating his wife, underpaying child support, 
living in sin with a woman and stealing money from the Little League. His 
opponent's TV ads showed a little boy in a baseball uniform pleading, "Senator, 
why did you take our money?" 
</P>
<P>
Nice, huh? Well, the problem isn't confined to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
In the Iowa Senate race, the GOP candidate called the Democrat "a hypocrite . . 
. out of touch with Iowans because he chooses to live in Virginia and the 
Bahamas." The Republican, who said he vacationed in his home town of Dubuque, 
displayed a map showing the location of the Democrat's vacation home in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
At a campaign rally in Chicago, Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.) complained about 
"pro-Israel money" coming into his inner-city district and publicly singled out 
contributors with Jewish names who had given money to his opponent. Savage, who 
was rebuked this year by the House Ethics Committee for making sexual advances 
to a Peace Corps worker in Africa, said his March 20 primary victory 
represented a defeat for Chicago's "white racist press" and the "suburban 
Zionist lobby." 
</P>
<P>
In the California gubernatorial race, former San Francisco Mayor Diane 
Feinstein's new television spot cites the brutal smear campaign Richard M. 
Nixon waged against Helen Gahagan Douglas in 1950. But then Feinstein justified 
the ad as a lesson in history and and insisted it "is not a comparison" between 
Nixon and state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who is running against her. 
</P>
<P>
Why has U.S. politics become so debased? Television is often blamed. True, 
negativism and triviality have been features of U.S. political life for more 
than 200 years, long before the advent of television. They didn't have 
television in 1800, when a campaign leaflet asked, "Can serious and reflecting 
men look about them and doubt that if (Thomas) Jefferson is elected . . . those 
morals which protect our lives from the knife of the assassin -- which guard 
the chastity of our wives and daughters from seduction and violence -- defend 
our property from plunder and devastation, and shield our religion from 
contempt and profanation, will not be trampled upon and exploded?" 
</P>
<P>
They didn't have television in 1884, when Republican candidate James G. Blaine 
was ridiculed as a "continental liar from the state of Maine" and the GOP 
returned fire by making an issue of Democrat Grover Cleveland's sex life. 
</P>
<P>
But television has made a difference. It has made negative campaigning more 
efficient. According to Jan van Lohuizen of Market Opinion Research, it is 
easier for voters to decide who to eliminate than who to support. "It's easier 
to use negative information to get people to say, 'I can't vote for A,' than to 
persuade them to say 'I really like B,' " Van Lohuizen said. 
</P>
<P>
Television is expensive and candidates have limited resources. They need to get 
the most bang for their bucks. Since negative ads have the strongest impact, 
that's what they run first. They run positive ads only if they can afford to. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, politicians were afraid to go negative on TV. Television 
commercials were too conspicuous and too risky. An exception was the famous 
"daisy ad" used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 campaign. That commercial, 
suggesting that Barry M. Goldwater might blow up the world, was broadcast once. 
It electrified the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The real breakthrough came in 1980, when the National Conservative Political 
Action Committee (NICPAC) ran tough negative ads against liberal Democratic 
senators, most of whom were defeated. It was not clear that the NICPAC ads made 
the difference -- all GOP candidates did well in 1980. But the experience 
demonstrated negative campaigning was not necessarily dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 1988 Bush campaign that proved how far you could go with a negative 
campaign: to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats also learned a lesson from the 1988 campaign. You have to fight back. 
Indeed, candidates are not just fighting back. They are staging preemptive 
strikes. If a candidate suspects his opponent is likely to go negative, he goes 
negative first. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there is a price. It breeds deep cynicism in the electorate. But 
that's not really a problem for politicians. They don't care how many people 
vote. They only care about getting more votes than the other guy. As one 
consultant put it, "In product advertising, if some people get so turned off by 
the ad that they don't come into the store, everybody loses. It's not that way 
with politics." 
</P>
<P>
But there are also substantial reasons for the trivializing of U.S. politics. 
Political debate has become stalemated on two issues -- taxes and values. The 
Democrats got Mondaled on the tax issue in 1984. Then they got Dukakised on 
values in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-tax consensus has ruled U.S. politics for 12 years. It started with 
Proposition 13 in California in 1978 and culminated in George Bush's "read my 
lips -- no new taxes" campaign in 1988. Candidates find it difficult to talk 
about moving the nation's agenda forward as long as there are no resources 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence suggests that the tax revolt is still alive. In last month's 
Illinois primary, angry suburban taxpayers threw veteran Republicans out of 
office. They also threw a scare into Jim Edgar, the GOP candidate for governor, 
who favors a permanent increase in the state income tax. Edgar lost one-third 
of the primary vote to an obscure anti-tax conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Gov. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut, a Democrat, announced he 
would not seek a third term. He saw his popularity collapse after he pushed 
through a $1-billion tax increase. "It would be a very, very difficult 
campaign," O'Neill said. "I think it would have to be a negative campaign, and 
I'm not sure that at this point in my life I wanted to start competing in that 
type of operation." 
</P>
<P>
Politicians are keeping a close eye on California's Proposition 111, a measure 
on the June primary ballot that would upgrade the state's transportation system 
-- and double the state's gasoline tax. Virtually the entire California 
Establishment supports the measure. But its chances for passage are iffy. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans claim to hold the advantage on "values" as well as taxes. The GOP 
has perfected the art of portraying Democrats as outside the mainstream on such 
issues as law and order, morality and patriotism. They did it to George 
McGovern in 1972, and they did it to Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In Michigan, for example, Republican Senate candidate Rep. Bill Schuette has 
made the death penalty his key issue against incumbent Democratic Sen. Carl 
Levin. "I have consistently supported the death penalty for drug traffickers 
and cop killers," Schuette says. Schuette accuses Levin of "leading the fight 
against the death penalty" and says he is "out of step with the mainstream of 
Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
The death penalty is a "from Mars" issue. When voters hear that a politician 
opposes the death penalty, their response is, "This guy must be from Mars." The 
only politicians who get away with opposing capital punishment are those who 
can explain their position in terms of deep-seated moral or religious 
convictions. New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo can do that. Few others can. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Democrats scramble to preempt the issue. In California, Feinstein 
ran a TV spot with the tag-line, "She's the only Democrat for governor for the 
death penalty." She shot up in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Democrats finally have a values issue they can call their own -- 
abortion. If Republicans hit you on the death penalty, Democrats say, hit them 
back on abortion. Anti-abortion candidates are on the defensive all over the 
country. It's even worse if they try to modify their views. Then it becomes a 
character issue. Voters are suspicious of candidates who check to see which way 
the wind is blowing and then change their convictions. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, here's what politics is about these days: If the other side gets 
you on taxes, you get them on abortion. As for serious problems such as drug 
abuse, education and the environment, why not follow the President's lead? 
</P>
<P>
Bush doesn't talk about a great society, or even a good society. He talks about 
a 'kinder, gentler" nation and "a thousand points of light." His answer to 
urgent domestic problems is, "Have a nice day." 
</P>
<P>
That is also Bush's foreign policy. "You say you've overthrown a corrupt 
communist dictatorship? Wonderful! And have a nice day." 
</P>
<P>
Can anything be done about this trivialization of U.S. politics? For one thing, 
we can require broadcasters to give candidates and parties free TV time -- 
enough so that they would be forced to talk about what they are for as well as 
what they are against. 
</P>
<P>
Both national party chairmen support the idea of free TV time. It is a common 
practice in other countries. So why not here? Because the broadcasting industry 
would yell bloody murder. You would be taking money out of network pockets by 
forcing them to give away air time for free. 
</P>
<P>
The proper answer to that complaint is, "Tough noogies." Broadcasters are 
licensed by the government to use the public airwaves. There is no reason why 
the government shouldn't require stations to set aside a certain amount of free 
time for a legitimate public purpose. Anyway, why should broadcasters be 
getting rich off political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Former Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox was once asked whether anything more could be 
done to improve his state's prison system. "There's not a lot more we can do," 
the governor said, "unless we start getting a better class of prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
The same thing is true in politics. It's hard to see how we can improve things 
unless we start getting a better quality of leadership. We need politicians who 
want to move the nation's agenda forward. And who are willing to go beyond 
Bush's patented political formula, "Campaign nasty, govern nice."

CENSUS FIGURES HELP GROUP CLOUT, HARDLY COUNT THE MINORITY OF ONE

I associate the word census with Christmas midnight Mass, with the priest 
reading St. Luke's Gospel: "At that time there went forth a decree from Caesar 
Augustus that a census of the whole world should be taken . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
You do not have to be a child, though I suppose it helps, to be awed by the 
epic event -- the ancient world discovering itself. One thousand, nine hundred 
and ninety years later, the government envelope arrives in my mailbox: 
Sincerely yours, the Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks there have been news stories about this census. For weeks political 
leaders have been urging Americans who live in closets or shadows to be 
counted, to use the census as a way of voting. The Chinese-American activist 
tells his fellow Chinese-Americans -- legally here or not -- that they should 
fill out the census form for their community's good. The gay activist tells gay 
men and women that being counted is a political assertion. Last week was the 
spectacle of census-takers prowling through the urban dark, trying to count the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The census is important, not as a national tally but for its splintered 
results. Journalists and senators, social activists and advertising executives 
will look at the numbers within numbers -- the subgroups. Not the "World Book" 
total -- how many of us are here -- but how different we are from each other. 
</P>
<P>
Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, is quoted in a Hispanic newspaper with the cadence of a 
political activist: "Our size must be fully documented to ensure that, 
economically and politically, we receive our portion of the pie." The pie. The 
American pie. In the 1960s, the hymn of the black civil-rights movement 
described an America united. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke with Pauline 
eloquence of a nation uniting Christian and Jew, old and young, rich and poor, 
black and white. Within a decade, by the 1970s, the heroic struggle for black 
equality was replaced by competition for pieces of a pie. The quest for a 
portion of power became an end in itself. The metaphor for the American city 
was the committee room: One black, one woman, one person under 30. The new 
American way. 
</P>
<P>
So why do I hesitate when it comes to Question No. 4 -- the one in the census 
referring to race? And then hesitate again with No. 7? Isn't this a 
straightforward question? 
</P>
<P>
Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin? 
</P>
<P>
I remember, not long ago, talking with several Spanish-language TV executives. 
None of them, incidentally, was Hispanic. But they were interested in Hispanic 
numbers. They were expecting that the new census numbers would make their jobs 
easier and more lucrative. They were pleased especially that Question No. 7 
allows respondents to specify their ethnic Hispanic group. Puerto Rican. 
Nicaraguan. The answers would help ad agencies "target the diverse Hispanic 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Social activists tell me that numbers are everything in Sacramento or 
Washington. Hispanics matter because they are a large number, getting larger. 
To a certain extent it seems logical and right that politicians attend to needs 
and problems as they grow larger. But what about the needs of those who do not 
belong to a group that is large and getting larger? Doesn't the single life 
deserve attention in Sacramento or Washington? Or have I missed the point of 
democracy? 
</P>
<P>
"I count," someone says. Meaning: I matter. Is there anything sadder than 
hearing the opposite: "I don't count." 
</P>
<P>
And yet there are people, many millions of them, who do not count or who do not 
think that they do. They are people of every race, of every color. Most are 
poor. Most are poorly educated. What they have in common is that they do not 
think of themselves as in common, as belonging to majority society, our 
society, or in league with each other. They are people of a margin, at the 
edge. People who lack the will or desire or ability or energy to speak publicly 
of themselves as a "we." 
</P>
<P>
We know such people exist and yet we trivialize their plight. We speak, for 
example, of "minority groups." We use the word minority in a simple collective 
sense, usually to mean that certain populations are underrepresented in public 
life. We ignore the deeper, more urgent cultural sense of the term minority. We 
speak of minority groups without irony or a sense of paradox. We forget that 
the true minority is the person -- male or female, white or black -- who for 
any one of a thousand private reasons is without the consolation of belonging 
to a group. 
</P>
<P>
Now we speak of "the homeless." Last week census takers searched them out -- a 
government looking for its lost children. The homeless. Perhaps we must cluster 
them together with such an expression. But the term should not let us forget 
that the ones -- ones -- who live in the streets are people alone, lives adrift 
in a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two decades we have tried various bureaucratic solutions that do 
not make fine distinctions. We group Americans by race and do not bother to 
notice their differences. No distinction is drawn between the black teen-ager 
who is also middle-class and the teen-ager who lives in the inner city -- the 
true minority child of violence, of shuttered possibility, of despair. 
</P>
<P>
There is a burden to being an "I" in America when "one" is the ultimate 
minority -- an outsider -- in America. For the rest of us, the lure, the reason 
so many people would come here is the "I." This nation gives you access -- to 
the freeway, to ambition, to drive, to becoming more than your parents. 
</P>
<P>
The middle-class price for such opportunity, especially now in this vast 
society, is sometime loneliness. Middle-class Americans have grown decadent 
with self-pity. Ethnic students at American universities, for example, leave 
home and family for ambition and then construct ethnic tribalism at school to 
convince themselves that nothing has changed in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Americans look for relief from the loneliness ambition has brought them. The 
census form for 1990 suggests a middle-class country that is no longer 
interested in the epic tally, a nation of people afraid of a national "we." 
</P>
<P>
Question No. 7 is as impersonal as only a government survey can manage to be. 
Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin? 
</P>
<P>
I am. 
</P>
<P>
But I put down my pencil. I refuse to be grouped for advertising executives. I 
refuse to be grouped for the activist who will then proclaim me in some tally 
of a minority group, because I know there are true minorities in this country 
very different from me. 
</P>
<P>
I refuse to darken the circle because I am otherwise grateful to America for 
what it has given me -- the chance to see my number in the final figure, one 
among the national tally.

OLD ALLIES GO TO WAR OVER REMAP; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: LEAGUE'S STAND IN FAVOR OF A COMMISSION TO REDRAW DISTRICTS HAS THE 
DEMOCRATS FUMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
State Democratic lawmakers have declared war on the state League of Women 
Voters. The staunchly nonpartisan group, a frequent Democratic ally on 
public-policy issues, is allied with Republicans in backing a reapportionment 
measure that Democrats hate. 
</P>
<P>
The league got directly involved in the reapportionment issue last June, when 
it endorsed Proposition 119. Authored by San Mateo County Supervisor Tom 
Huening, a Republican, the June ballot measure would take redistricting power 
from the Legislature and give it to a 12-member commission. Retired 
appellate-court justices would appoint the commission members -- five 
Democrats, five Republicans and two independents. Racial, ethnic, gender and 
geographic diversity would be required. 
</P>
<P>
As do the Democrats, the league opposes Proposition 118, which would keep 
redistricting in the hands of legislators. It likes Proposition 119 because it 
is "partisan neutral" and political power is shifted from officeholders to 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders in Washington and California don't see reapportionment in 
anything but partisan terms, since their legislative control is on the line. To 
protect themselves, they have mounted a multimillion-dollar campaign to defeat 
both reapportionment measures. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Democrats contend that Proposition 119 would let big money and 
special interests shape the post-census political map. Their agents would be 
the judges who'd appoint the commission, or "mostly old white men," to use 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's description. 
</P>
<P>
Its endorsement of Proposition 119 has clearly tarnished the league's luster in 
Democratic circles. At a recent women's forum in Ontario on redistricting, 
Brown implied that the League of Women Voters should stay in the kitchen where 
it belongs. Since last summer, Democratic lawmakers in Sacramento have 
unmercifully dumped on the organization's 17-year lobbyist, Margaret Herman. 
"I've never seen anything like it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Galizio, Brown's chief of staff, refused to meet with Herman to discuss 
some policy issues on the ground that the league is "too partisan." Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda), Brown's chief remapping deputy, said many 
colleagues were surprised at the league's "naivete" and "Alice in Wonderland" 
attitude in backing Proposition 119. "The league," said Katz, "has sold out to 
the GOP." 
</P>
<P>
All this has fostered a move within the league to reconsider its support for 
Proposition 119. A letter discrediting the commission idea is currently being 
circulated. 
</P>
<P>
But league president Carole Wagner Vallianos said that she would not hesitate 
to go to court to defend her group's nonpartisan reputation. She has challenged 
Speaker Brown to a debate on the pros and cons of Proposition 119. 
</P>
<P>
How did Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein come upon the idea 
to use Richard Nixon to fend off John Van de Kamp's negative TV ad assault and 
call for a positive campaign? 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein chose the Nixon "smear" metaphor after hearing the reaction of old 
political war horse Hadley Roff, an aide, to a Van de Kamp speech last month in 
San Jose. The attorney general linked Feinstein to convicted Sacramento 
legislator Joseph Montoya and the crimes of ex-Philippine dictator Ferdinand 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
"That sounds like Nixon smearing Douglas," said Roff, referring to the 1950 
U.S. Senate campaign. Nixon christened Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas the "Pink 
Lady" for her allegedly leftist views.

ENOUGH WATER FOR EVERYBODY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visionary that he was, William Mulholland was never content with having only as 
much water as Los Angeles and Southern California needed, but to always have 
more than enough so that the region could accommodate the growth that was sure 
to come. Not only did Mulholland bring the Owens River more than 200 miles to 
Los Angeles early in the century, he created the Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California in the 1920s to reach across the desert to pull in an 
even-grander supply of Colorado River water. In the 1960s, Metropolitan went 
further afield to pursue another notion of Mulholland's: to capture an 
additional supply from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
As historian Kevin Starr has written, Southern California invented itself 
through these great water projects. And the California dream could be nourished 
and expanded seemingly forever if there always was enough water. But today, 
even the lineal keepers of the Mulholland flame are realizing that such dreams 
have limits. In an extraordinary seminar this past week, the 51-member 
Metropolitan board of directors debated openly for the first time the wisdom of 
Met's most fundamental tenet: Whether the agency should, or could, continue to 
promise water to all additional comers within its 5,200-square-mile service 
area ranging from Ventura County to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
There was no formal action, but the fact that the Met board of directors would 
even ponder such an heretical premise is significant. In the past, the board 
has been criticized as a creaky bastion of a putative establishment held 
captive by the dreams of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there's a revolution imminent at Met headquarters on Sunset Boulevard: 
The challenged annexations to Met territory are relatively insignificant. Still 
intact is the "Laguna Declaration" of 1952 that codified the Mulholland ideal 
that Met, as the monopoly water importer for Southern California, would meet 
all demands. Nor has revisionist thought polluted all Met directors. One 
declared Wednesday: "Let's get the damn water and deliver it." But Met's 
supplies are being crimped from all sides. The shortages caused by the current 
four-year drought are but a symptom of what will be normal in the near future 
unless new supplies are developed. That water will not come from more giant 
projects but through modern management that includes conservation programs, 
water exchanges with agricultural users and the ability to work with old 
Northern California adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
To these ends the Met staff under General Manager Carl Boronkay already has 
shown some leadership. And the new board chairwoman, Lois Krieger of Riverside, 
has demonstrated a willingness to lead Met in new directions. With the support 
of an enlightened and flexible board, Met can structure itself to provide the 
water this region will need in the 21st Century. This process may lack the 
grandeur of the big water projects of the past, but it is no less visionary.

A FAST DEAL WITH MEXICO UNLIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A free-trade agreement between Mexico and the United States is one of those 
ideas that looks great on paper but could be very hard to make work in the real 
world. But it's good that the two governments have agreed to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing the many trade, investment and labor barriers between Mexico and the 
United States, in theory at least, makes a great deal of sense. Mexico is poor, 
with a young and fast-growing population. It needs the investment and 
technology the United States has to offer. The United States needs the oil and 
other natural resources Mexico has, including cheap labor. And a nearby market 
of 100 million Mexicans eager to buy U.S.-made goods sounds exciting, too. 
</P>
<P>
That's why it was big news last week when the Bush Administration revealed that 
top U.S. officials have met privately with their Mexican counterparts to 
discuss the possibility of negotiating a U.S.-Mexico free-trade agreement 
similar to a pact signed with Canada in 1988. But how even that tentative 
announcement was greeted in each country is very revealing. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. newspapers played it on the front page, befitting the importance of a plan 
that could create a common market of 350 million people from the Arctic Circle 
to Yucatan. Mexican media played it up too, but with a decidedly different 
spin: Their stories featured comments from Mexicans denouncing the plan, like 
the intellectual who warned that "our way of life is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be an expert on Mexico to know that kind of rhetoric means 
trouble for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. While many Mexicans like and 
even admire their powerful northern neighbor, they genuinely worry about their 
economy, even their very culture, being overwhelmed if Mexicans buy all the 
American blue jeans, Coke and rock records they can get their hands on. And 
these are not just leftist intellectuals in Mexico City: Some conservative 
Mexican businessmen don't relish the thought of competing with U.S. companies, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters further, Mexico could fairly ask for things under a 
free-trade agreement that would drive many U.S. citizens up a wall, such as an 
open border Mexicans could cross at will to look for jobs in the United States. 
Law-enforcement officials and labor unions, to mention just a couple of 
not-insignificant interest groups, would howl in protest over that one. 
</P>
<P>
With all the similarities of language, culture and economic development between 
Canada and the United States, it took three years to hammer out a free-trade 
agreement, and it'll take another 10 to phase it into full operation. Given the 
greater disparities between the United States and Mexico, a similar agreement 
may take decades. So we'll have plenty of time to debate its merits. And it 
will be debated -- widely and loudly -- in both countries.

DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY -- CRUEL PUNISHMENT OR JUSTICE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On March 26, Mother Teresa's pleas for the life of convicted murderer Harris 
were rejected by Gov. George Deukmejian. I don't see why Mother Teresa even 
attempted to persuade the governor from killing Harris. 
</P>
<P>
After all, what do you expect from a governor who consistently vetoes any 
legislation having to do with prenatal and health care for babies in this 
state; especially low-income babies born in black and Latino families. Hundreds 
and thousands of unhealthy babies die every year due to lack of educational, 
health and nutrition programs for these at-risk infants because to the 
governor's unconcern for poor babies. 
</P>
<P>
I am not against the death penalty, but I believe Mother Teresa was trying to 
tell us something; something that we should listen to very carefully.

<P>
I was extremely interested in the article with statistics on the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
How can the social scientists say that the death penalty is not a deterrence 
when we haven't had an execution in 23 years? Now Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp predicts it will be at least another year before the next execution. What 
good is the death penalty if it is not used? 
</P>
<P>
Let's have an execution every week for 52 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
This will not only bring the crime rate down but will save our taxpayers a lot 
of money to house these criminals and pay for their attorney fees.

Yes, there is a very clear answer -- capital punishment doesn't work. It may 
reduce crime in certain areas for a short period of time (even that can't be 
totally agreed upon), but the fact is -- killing will always occur. 
</P>
<P>
History has shown that all forms of capital punishment (public executions, 
public hangings, gas chamber, etc.) have accomplished nothing. It is much 
better to try and help these and other criminals (let's try using the word 
"people") return to society after serving beneficial jail and/or prison time. 
This can be performed at least by giving them counseling and teaching a skill 
or trade (with a guaranteed job). 
</P>
<P>
We can't stop the killing, but we can rise above the hypocrisy and "panic 
judgment" that say "kill those who kill."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Rohrlich's article "Does Death Penalty Deter Killers? No Clear Answer" 
(front page, March 23) gives the clear answer that death penalty advocates and 
opponents are engaged in a futile and never-ending debate. The question remains 
as to whether such arguing is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Is deterring murder the only reason for the death penalty? Apparently the 
opponents choose to favor that as one of the (if not the major) reasons for 
their opposition. They completely ignore the fact that no penalty for any crime 
deters people from committing that crime. Is the world free from burglary, 
robbery, rape, speeding or parking violations? They all have penalties, do they 
not? 
</P>
<P>
What then is the purpose of a penalty? The dictionary defines "penalty": 
punishment for crime or offense. The overwhelming majority of people believe 
that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment for murder. So be it.

MATERIAL DREAMS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE 1920S BY KEVIN STARR (OXFORD 
UNIVERSITY PRESS: $21.95; 424 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Norman Corwin, Corwin, visiting professor at USC's School of Journalism, is 
working with Paul Conrad on a collection of Conrad's cartoons of the Reagan 
years. Corwin's latest book is Trivializing America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Starr has written an engaging, eccentric history of Southern California 
in the '20s. It shifts focus like a zoom lens, from physical growth to cultural 
ferment, water to oil, cops to football, oligarchs to Babbits, Bible-thumpers 
to architects, transportation to bibliophilia, William Mulholland to Jake 
Zeitlin, Frank Lloyd Wright to Simon Rodia, ethnic mix to real estate. It has a 
sort of urban sprawl of its own, yet it manages to hang together the way a 
three-ring circus does -- a lot going on, clowns and trapeze artists and 
tigers, all under one awning. It is richly researched, informative, fun to 
read, and flawed. 
</P>
<P>
It seems a case of metaphor overkill -- not in the writing of metaphors, but in 
using the term as label. Thus we have what Starr calls a health-seeking 
metaphor, an originating metaphor, a privacy and retrenchment metaphor, a patio 
metaphor, resort metaphor, design metaphor, Biblical metaphor, Chicago 
metaphor, Santa Barbara metaphor, Newport metaphor, controlling metaphor, 
prophetic metaphor, technology metaphor, Christian metaphor, development 
metaphor, Spanish metaphor, tide-pool metaphor, genteel metaphor, a "flat 
landscape that suggested no easy metaphors," and advice that "the Salton Sea 
offered the deepest possible metaphor of the region." 
</P>
<P>
The writing is bright; it has substance, pace and vigor; it makes sense even 
when it stretches for metaphoric significance, but Starr is like a very good 
pitcher who every now and then throws a ball three feet over the catcher's 
head, as when after a good stretch of first-class writing, there are clusters 
of inverted sentences, or three sentences in a row that begin with participles. 
He uses "sub/urban" repeatedly, where just plain suburban would do for most of 
us. But these are small cavils, against the broad scale and integrity of his 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
The book opens with the whopping success story of irrigation in Southern 
California ("Foundations in Water . . . Hydraulic Visions and Historical 
Metaphors"). Los Angeles "made itself happen through will and water"; the city 
was a "hydraulic have-not" which had to "invent itself through water." 
</P>
<P>
William Mulholland, hydraulic engineer, was "the one universally acknowledged 
founder of Los Angeles"; the Department of Water and Power was "a second 
government"; without the resources of the Colorado River, and the longest 
aqueduct in the Western Hemisphere, there would be no modern Southern 
California. Starr acknowledges that the saga of struggle, power plays and 
annexation ploys entailed in the watering of the region, has been told before, 
even once in a movie, but his account is a model of succinctness, wired for 
metaphor: ". . . engineering as a mode of humanistic intent . . . the 
opportunity to co-create with divinity itself." (Outraged residents of Owens 
Valley dynamited the aqueduct 10 different times to protest the sequestering of 
water that had been given to them by the same divinity.) 
</P>
<P>
Then come pages on planning and development, ballyhoo, oil, the automobile, the 
emergence of institutional Los Angeles, the establishment for the first time in 
history of a city built around the automobile. As the '20s began, about 6,000 
electric cars radiated daily from downtown Los Angeles to link four contiguous 
counties. "Only wealthy and politically independent suburbs such as Palos 
Verdes and Beverly Hills were capable of planning with the landscape, not the 
automobile, as the primary consideration." The how and why of what happened to 
the streetcars is not spelled out, since they vanished in a later decade, and 
that story probably will be told in another increment of Starr's "America and 
the California Dream" series, of which the present volume is No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Several characters who flourished in the '20s have resonances today, as we 
discover on meeting Harry Culver and I. N. Van Nuys, now memorialized by Culver 
City and the community of Van Nuys; and Alphonso Bell, whose name is absorbed 
in Bel-Air; and Col. Griffith J. Griffith, who shot his wife, served two years 
in prison for attempted murder, and, in a more genial mode, deeded to the city 
3,000 acres which became Griffith Park; and E. W. Hilgard, agronomist, after 
whom the avenue and hotel in Westwood are named; and, of course, Edgar Rice 
Burroughs' "Tarzan of the Apes," who lives on in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
In a chapter on institutions in the '20s, Starr brackets an unlikely pair, the 
Department of Water and Power and the University of Southern California, for 
having "fully expressed and served the ambitions of Anglo-American Los Angeles 
in its expansionist exuberance." Following them, he cites the Philharmonic 
Orchestra and the L.A. Police Department for attaining "a high level of 
autonomous power and authority as they emerged as arbiters and brokers of the 
Los Angeles identity." 
</P>
<P>
Recollections of this period include one relating to football. In 1924, USC was 
asked to leave the Pacific Conference because of "lax scholastic standards," 
whereupon USC's then President Rufus von KleinSmid retaliated by seeking games 
with Notre Dame, the biggest-drawing team in the country. Two years later at 
Soldier's Field in Chicago, the match-up attracted 120,000 spectators, up to 
then the largest crowd ever to watch a game of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
Regional architecture has an engrossing chapter to itself, with emphasis on two 
stars: the Bradbury Building, which "came out of nowhere" in 1893 and which 
"challenged Los Angeles to begin thinking of itself as a big city, a Chicago on 
the Pacific"; and the Watts Towers, "sustained by the logic of constructivism . 
. . an architectural symbol equal in mystery and power to the Bradbury 
Building." 
</P>
<P>
Starr devotes two chapters to Santa Barbara as a contrasting alternative to Los 
Angeles, claiming that the city "turned its back on glitter and razzmatazz in 
favor of romantic historicizing and other preoccupations of the genteel 
tradition." Indeed Santa Barbara might have developed a harbor to parallel, on 
a smaller scale, Long Beach and Los Angeles, and might well have worked itself 
up into a major industrial center and aviation capital (Lockheed and Northrop 
got started there). Instead, it made a transition "from sanitarium to a resort 
. . . (to) an American Nice, sunny gold and blue, languid and irrelevant . . . 
listless, charming, with a disarming beauty . . . a pastoral place that 
preferred to stay that way," a city that in 1910 was equal if not superior to 
Hollywood in movie production (13 small companies made one-reelers there) but 
which chose to "pursue its dreams through architecture, not films." 
</P>
<P>
On life and letters in Southern California, the author, a former librarian, is 
in green pastures. All through the book his capsule biographies have the 
sharpness and cogency of "Aubrey's Brief Lives," and in the final chapters he 
is in top form. Sometimes the effect is gossipy: "MacIntyre was rumored to 
bring Occidental coeds there for purposes of seduction" . . . Robinson Jeffers 
while at USC pursued "a clandestine love affair with a married philosophy 
student" . . . "when Alfred's father died, their relationships became a 
marriage in name only" . . . "seduced by a Catholic prelate when she was 
fifteen. . . ." But the pages on Books and Bohemia in Greater Los Angeles; on 
the comings, goings and doings of Pasadena's literati; on the "Zeitlin Circle"; 
on Merle Armitage's "monstrous egomania" and "crypto-falangist sense of art as 
an elite defiance of the commonplace"; on Aldous Huxley, who once made a 
dedicatory speech at a Zeitlin bookshop; on M. F. K. Fisher, "the Virginia 
Woolf of cuisine"; on Ward Ritchie, still publishing; on Lawrence Clark Powell, 
still teaching; on the emergence of the Huntington Library as an important 
research institution in history and the humanities; all make sound reading. 
</P>
<P>
The late Jake (Jacob Israel) Zeitlin emerges as the warmest and most robust 
figure of Starr's literary phalanx. "Creative Los Angeles found in Zeitlin an 
emblem, a principle of aspiration and continuity, a listener, a patron, a 
friend . . . who functioned almost rabbinically as counselor, and confidante . 
. . who helped innumerable artists and writers and other creative aspirants 
toward fulfillment . . . who helped Los Angeles emerge as a national book and 
library center." The gods smiled on Zeitlin, for he went from itinerant book 
peddler, so poor his first child was born in a charity ward, to become an 
international figure in the rare-book trade. Among other grand slams, he sold 
144 illuminated manuscripts to the Getty Museum for $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
There are enough good quotes in this book to fuel a mini-compendium. Two 
examples: Frank Hogan, attorney who defended millionaire Edward Doheny in the 
big oil scandal of the '20s: "A lawyer's ideal client is a rich man who is 
scared"; and preacher Aimee Semple McPherson's instruction to her congregation 
at collection time: "Sister has a headache tonight. Just quiet money please." 
</P>
<P>
A bounteous and valuable bibliographical essay rounds out this third volume in 
Starr's series of California dream sequences. Next scheduled is "The Dream 
Endures: California Through the Great Depression."

MORLEY SAFER, LIVE FROM HO CHI MINH CITY; 
</P>
<P>
FLASHBACKS ON RETURNING TO VIETNAM BY MORLEY SAFER (RANDOM HOUSE: $18.95; 224 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeff Danziger, Danziger is an editorial cartoonist and a Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morley Safer takes a trip back to the Vietnam he reported from for most of the 
conflict, and his findings and recollections are well worth reading. His style 
is spare and sharp. Mercifully, he avoids finding great lessons where there are 
none. 
</P>
<P>
I attribute his manner to his being essentially still a Canadian, despite years 
at CBS. Like most Canadians, he routinely deducts 90% of the ballyhoo of 
American journalism. 
</P>
<P>
His trip starts in the north, in Hanoi, where the deprivation in daily life 
today is little changed since the worst years of the war. He writes: "The sheer 
drabness of the place is punishment enough . . . " for the crime of being 
Communist. But in the north, "they just do not seem to care about things like 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He visits a hospital outside Hanoi for veterans who lost limbs, a horror of 
rudimentary prosthetic therapy. The men are old and the building is cold and 
lonely. "Surely (Vietnam) is not so poor," Safer writes, "that it must do this 
to these loyal men who have had their bodies broken so badly. Ho would be 
ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
In short, the North Vietnamese veterans were not even born on the Fourth of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
He visits the legendary Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, then the genius of Dien Bien Phu 
and Khe Sanh; now, at 80, a classic, aging warrior, spouting clunky wisdoms 
about his former enemies and their failures. 
</P>
<P>
"Your casualties were a waste of lives," Giap says, "Ours were martyrs to a 
cause. I don't think Westmoreland understood that." Initially, Giap sounds like 
a wise and inscrutable Asian patriot. (On second reading, his thoughts are 
nearly as turgid as some of Westmoreland's. 
</P>
<P>
Safer has a gift for vignette, no doubt the product of years of trying to get a 
point across between laxative ads. He sketches scenes of the children in Hanoi 
who still play in the wreckage of American airplanes in a place called the Park 
of the B-52s. On shortwave, he hears Oral Roberts Jr. promising Vietnam that, 
"something Good, something Really Good is going to happen to you . . . today!" 
And in Danang, he stops at a vast junkyard of American trucks, Jeeps and other 
war waste, piled up and rusting; tanks and helicopters left like "Ozymandias in 
camouflage." Not as much of it left now, explains the junkyard manager. He 
tells Safer: 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese ships come every month. They take it back to Japan and melt it 
down. I don't know what they do with it after that." 
</P>
<P>
Well, we know. Just like the last war -- from here to infinity. 
</P>
<P>
In between the present-day scenes, Safer remembers the past. He pays a visit to 
the Caravelle Hotel in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, where he once lived in 
Room 206, now occupied by the Hungarian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
At the bar at the Caravelle, Safer recalls people he met there during the war 
-- Sen. Barry Goldwater (before his reincarnation as a harmless curmudgeon), 
drunk and bloodthirsty, railing profanely at reporters; William F. Buckley, 
flitting lightly among the tables; most notably, Dan Rather, in his formative 
years, friendly but incipiently odd, sporting a leather holster and a 
nickel-plated Smith and Wesson .38 revolver. "I could not imagine whom he might 
have to shoot in the Caravelle." Safer writes: "The service was always quite 
good." 
</P>
<P>
People left over from the war are still to be seen everywhere in Vietnam, 
painfully so. Veterans on the South Vietnamese side, abandoned by the 
Americans, are equally orphaned by the Hanoi government. In postwar Saigon, 
"the Northerners are regarded as another invader, another usurper." 
</P>
<P>
When word gets around that a CBS VIP is in town, two hapless Vietnamese in 
their 50s, Mr. Suu and Mr. Tu, show up seeking an audience with Safer. They 
were cameramen for CBS in May of 1975. They have a letter that complains: ". . 
. we two persons had not got pay yet." They have all the paper work, now 15 
years old, to back their plea: "Please, dear sir, Mr. Morley, we are desperate. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Safer assures the reader that, even as we read this, the check is in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
The big excitement of the book is presumably that an important Time magazine 
reporter and source, Pham Xuan An, was a colonel in the North Vietnamese army 
all the while he was reporting on the war for the magazine. An had joined the 
Viet Minh years before the United States was ever in the war, and never quit. 
Safer goes to visit him, now in comfortable retirement. 
</P>
<P>
An's loyalties were split between the Communist side and the American friends 
he had in the press. An arranged for his family to escape to the United States 
when Saigon fell, but remained behind himself, he says, because his mother was 
too old to travel. An gets more of a glowing report from Safer than I would 
think he deserved, and I doubt Random House will be quoting Time's reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
Safer is a strong writer and pretty fearless, at least by today's standards, 
but he should have put more detail in the book. It does read in spots as if it 
were being timed as a voice-over. I had the feeling that there's more of 
legitimate interest he could tell us, particularly of news coverage of the war. 
</P>
<P>
Safer, you may remember, earned Lyndon Johnson's wrath for his reports on the 
torching of Vietnam villages by American troops, the images that made L.B.J.'s 
claim that he wanted to win hearts and minds sound like the lie it was. And 
Safer steps right up with actual, real-life criticism of the CBS management, 
calling it a "Comintern" and deriding current television journalists as 
"contract-crazed chorus girls and boys." Connie Chung, call your lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the Vietnam War was for Safer, as for so many other journalists now 
at the height of their craft, the defining and refining experience of their 
lives. Unlike the previous generation of reporters, whose expectations were 
formed by World War II's victory and reconstruction, the reporters in Vietnam 
saw defeat and confusion. And in the confusion, the press was blamed, to a 
large extent, for the loss. Safer, and other reporters who can write 
analytically, should be re-examining what happened with even greater 
incisiveness or this charge will stick. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, after all, war's first casualty, and the victors get to bury it. We 
were not the victors in Vietnam. And the truth is still out there, wandering 
around somewhere.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don T. Phan, Phan, a Vietnamese immigrant, is a businessman and a free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hearts of Sorrow" is an oral history of the travails of Vietnamese emigres in 
America, told through the words of 14 refugees. The author, an anthropology 
professor at San Jose State University, includes as subjects many residents of 
Santa Clara County, where one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the 
United States is located. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously a sympathetic observer, he devotes much of the opening chapters to 
debunking common "misconceptions" about refugees, such as alleged high welfare 
dependency, special treatment on the part of government authorities and 
extensive gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
The main body of the text comprises five parts in roughly chronological order, 
covering narrators' recollections of childhood, war (anti-French resistance and 
occupation by the Japanese in World War II, with surprisingly little space 
devoted to the U.S. intervention), the aftermath of "liberation," their escapes 
from Vietnam and finally the American experience. 
</P>
<P>
In his quest for "ordinary" narrators, the author studiously avoids "leaders, 
generals and other famous Vietnamese." He assembles men and women generally 
drawn from what middle class existed in Vietnam before the end of the war in 
1975. They are young and old, Catholics and Buddhists, Northerners and 
Southerners in a variety of occupations, including a former ARVN (South 
Vietnamese Army) colonel, a Buddhist nun, a schoolteacher, an automobile 
mechanic and others. 
</P>
<P>
Least known, and therefore of greatest interest, are experiences of Southerners 
under the repression following "liberation." Also notable are the recollections 
of an ethnic Chinese elder, which provide a rich portrait of life under 
Communist rule in the North, coping with the bombing of Hanoi, and expulsion 
from Vietnam following the war with China. This elderly man's final comments on 
American government, lobbyists, division of power among the branches, 
patriotism and the proper balance between freedom and social obligations show a 
surprisingly complete understanding of American governance. 
</P>
<P>
As a primer about what the author calls "the end of an era, a world lost, a way 
of life that exists now only in memory," "Hearts of Sorrow" vividly records 
ancient Vietnamese traditions and customs. Such ceremonies as family gatherings 
to honor departed relatives on the anniversaries of their deaths and 
celebrations of the Lunar New Year are described in rich detail. 
</P>
<P>
As far as "documenting what (the narrators) consider their successes and 
failures," the stories recount mostly failures in their American experience. No 
doctors, lawyers, executives, entrepreneurs, valedictorians or Ivy League 
graduates will be found here. Frustrations range from racial discrimination and 
the difficulty of earning a living to children neglecting parents and ignoring 
their counsel in choosing a mate. 
</P>
<P>
Gestures of kindness also are recorded, such as a church's offer to build a new 
house for a family of refugees. A former fisherman prizes his independence as a 
vegetable vendor despite meager earnings. Yet the positive notes seem few and 
far between. 
</P>
<P>
A professional scholar, the author sprinkles the text with many references to 
other books and articles, yet his lack of background in Vietnamese culture and 
language does show. An example would be the explanation for why Southerners 
call their first child "Number Two" -- plausible, yes, but no substitute for 
the standard explanation taught every Vietnamese schoolboy for at least a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
Because many translators are used, "Hearts of Sorrow's" translations are 
sometimes inconsistent (for instance, "village person" and "man of the 
countryside" -- both presumably nha que in Vietnamese) or incorrect ("Buddhist 
canon"; more accurately "psalms"). A Vietnamese speaker, however, would 
recognize with fondness the many proverbs and colorful expressions translated 
word by word ("wet jackfruit" -- a whiner, or "direct train" -- sending someone 
to his death). 
</P>
<P>
"Fallen Leaves" starts in Cu Chi, famous long after the war for its tunnels dug 
by Communist guerrillas, the subject of recent books by American veterans and 
now a tourist attraction. Following the prologue, the book takes us through the 
life of a Vietnamese woman, from her birth in 1940 to the fall of Saigon in 
1975, with a short epilogue in 1982. While the historical events of this period 
are well discussed in "Hearts of Sorrow," "Fallen Leaves" offers the reader a 
more continuous story from a single viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The book takes a surprisingly dim view of American intervention, considering 
that the author prospers from doing business with the 25th Division, romances 
U.S. soldiers, elopes to Las Vegas for a divorce from her Vietnamese husband, 
and marries an American officer who turns out not to be Prince Charming after 
all. The text emphasizes the brutality, corruption, prostitution and drug 
problems that accompanied the "arrogant and rude" Americans' presence. 
</P>
<P>
Co-authors Edith Kreisler and Sandra Christenson clearly had a hand in 
inserting a wealth of information setting the historical context at strategic 
intervals in the narrative -- for example, the reference to American interest 
in "containment of international Communism" and the arrival in Saigon of one 
"Colonel Edward G. Lansdale, USAF, working for the CIA." One wishes that they 
had prevailed on Nguyen Thi Thu-Lam to use the full names of friends, 
brothers-in-law and relatives so that their implied significance as political 
actors could be corroborated. 
</P>
<P>
As publications of the Council on Southeast Asia Studies, Yale Center for 
Int'l. &amp; Area Studies, "Fallen Leaves" and "To Be Made Over," discussed 
below, share a meticulous care in spelling Vietnamese words. With its acute and 
circumflex accents, tildes and other diacriticals often used in combination, 
exact spelling can be a challenge even for the native speaker. In addition to 
fiction and poetry, the council also publishes research monographs and sponsors 
a speaker series on a variety of topics concerning Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Fallen Leaves" is less successful with the few French phrases that do 
appear. Apologie would hardly be the preferred rendering for apology in French. 
More disturbing perhaps are the occasional typographical errors in the English 
text. The author also speaks to Americans, friends, business associates and 
husband alike, exclusively in pidgin English, which appears in no other 
context. 
</P>
<P>
"Fallen Leaves" is an exceedingly poetic image in Vietnamese. Not only does the 
title form a nice symmetry with the author's name, which means "forest in 
autumn," but a common expression uses these very words in combination with 
"returning to your roots." This memoir presumably served as an opportunity for 
the author to reflect on her roots. It is a complete story of the war years, 
with a wealth of Vietnamese proverbs and expressions, and illustrations of 
customs, but one should not read the political interpretations without 
skepticism, as the author discusses in a cursory fashion many events of which 
she had no personal knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"To Be Made Over" is an anthology that lives up well to its subtitle, "Tales of 
Socialist Reeducation in Vietnam." While Nhat Tien, alone among the many 
authors, was a noted writer before the fall of Saigon, one can sense even 
through the translation the wistful, ironic prose that is the hallmark of 
contemporary Vietnamese literature. The translation is of high quality overall, 
but occasionally one is reminded of the headmistress in "Lolita" observing to 
Dr. Humbert that foreigners often create interesting combinations in the 
English language (witness "lachrymatory theatrics"). 
</P>
<P>
The stories range from an old couple's volunteering to pull the plow to atone 
for their son's desertion ("In the Footsteps of a Water Buffalo") to a cadre 
scheming to extract bribes from political prisoners ("City Life"). First, the 
cadre is surprised beyond belief by his cousin's lavish life in a captured 
mansion in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). Returning to the isolated prison camp 
where he is stationed, he laboriously plots his approach to an accomplice and 
his selection of a victim. Alas, he has picked a young man no longer rich nor 
with a family to return to. In this story, the author takes us through the plot 
at a deliberate pace, successively exploring greed, shame, fear and suspicion 
through the story of the cadre. This is but one example of how the entire 
anthology's many vivid descriptions make the reader wonder whether he is 
reading fact or fiction. 
</P>
<P>
While an audience of native Vietnamese would follow the stories from "To Be 
Made Over" with little difficulty, the translation fails to provide sufficient 
background information for the younger Vietnamese or the English-speaking 
reader. The latter would not recognize Mrs. Ngo Ba Thanh as a prominent 
opponent of sundry South Vietnamese regimes, or understand that the distinctive 
accent "which inverts I's and N's" is the hallmark of the southern edge of 
North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for its dry, ironic wit, and its uncanny ring of truth, this is the one 
book among the three that should not be missed.

RICHARD EDER: HAS HE FORGOTTEN ANYTHING?; 
</P>
<P>
THE THINGS THEY CARRIED BY TIM O'BRIEN (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN/ SEYMOUR LAWRENCE: 
$18.95; 273 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why is he still writing about the Vietnam War, Tim O'Brien imagines a child 
asking him. Why not write about a little girl who finds a million dollars and 
spends it on a Shetland pony? 
</P>
<P>
The reader may ask the same question, though probably not about the pony. 
Writing that commands the graceful and unsparing strength that O'Brien used in 
"Going After Cacciato" a dozen years ago is rare. How we need writers to give 
us an equivalent strength and discrimination for the more inchoate puzzlement 
of our own days! 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, whose reflections and comments run through this new chain of Vietnam 
stories, faces the question. He takes it up, puts it down, takes it up again. 
He tells us that you get your material where you find it. That's off-hand, even 
crude. Then, later: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 43 years old and I'm still writing war stories. . . . The remembering 
makes it now. And sometimes remembering will lead to a story which makes it 
forever. That's what stories are for. Stories are for joining the past and the 
present." 
</P>
<P>
If you are in prison, you write to get out; O'Brien's memories still encircle 
him. But the fuller justification for "The Things They Carried" is the writing 
itself. Some of it does seem like the most acute of second thoughts. Some of 
the less interesting pieces do seem like a harking-back in order to re-live the 
extra aliveness that came with the horrors. 
</P>
<P>
But the best of these stories -- and none is written with less than the sharp 
edge of a honed vision -- are memory as prophecy. They tell us not where we 
were but where we are; and perhaps where we will be. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien draws upon his own experience in Vietnam, of course, but the characters 
and incidents are fictional, he writes. He casts himself, though, both as a 
fictional member of the platoon where the stories are set and as the narrator 
meditating upon them years later. 
</P>
<P>
His voice advances, halts, doubles back. An incident will be told in two or 
three different ways; it will be interrupted, it will peter out, and resume. 
Sometimes it will deny some of what it has told us, or tell us that it happened 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Tell a Story in Wartime" is the title of one set of story fragments, 
reflections and comments. A story cannot be told straight, it informs us. What 
is to be told is so hideous, unpredictable and absurd that the narrator has to 
manipulate it, duck away and invent. In war, you tell a story to escape or 
change the thing you have to tell. 
</P>
<P>
These 19- and 20-year-olds, plucked from their ordinary lives and hijacked into 
a nightmare, have to invent themselves as well as their stories. Jensen and 
Strunk get into a fight over a jackknife; Jensen smashes Strunk's nose so badly 
he needs to be hospitalized. When Strunk returns a few days later, Jensen 
begins to worry that he may use one of innumerable opportunities to kill him. 
He breaks his own nose with his pistol butt; now they're even. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are they even, but they are buddies. They sign a contract that if 
either is so badly wounded as to become a wheelchair case, the other will kill 
him. Strunk's leg is blown off; Jensen comes over to comfort him. "Don't kill 
me," Strunk begs. "Swear you won't kill me." Jensen swears. All this is told, 
in fact, in two successive stories, the first called "Enemies," the second 
"Friends." The two, in this unhinging light, are synonymous. 
</P>
<P>
A patrol goes up to a highland to stay a week and listen for enemy activity. It 
is foggy up there; listen is all they can do. And they begin to hear music: 
string quartets, choirs, the tinkling glasses and chatter of a cocktail party. 
One of the patrol describes it to the narrator: 
</P>
<P>
"The rock -- it's talking. And the fog too, and the grass and the goddamn 
mongooses. Everything talks. The trees talk politics, the monkeys talk 
religion. The whole country. Vietnam. The place talks. It talks. Understand? 
Nam -- it truly talks." 
</P>
<P>
They radio for air strikes; all night long, the empty hill is hit with napalm, 
incendiaries, fragmentation bombs. It is irrational and utterly rational at the 
same time. To these farm and city boys, all explanations of why they are there 
are no less imaginary than the hills talking. 
</P>
<P>
There is beastliness, and there are odd, invented moralities. The platoon goes 
through a village where an air strike has silenced everything. Only a 
14-year-old girl is left, dancing crazily outside the house where her dead 
parents lie. That night, one of the soldiers does an obscene burlesque of her 
movements. "Dance right," another screams at him. 
</P>
<P>
The most extraordinary piece in the collection is the first, which bears its 
title. "What They Carried" begins as nothing but a list, it seems. It is a list 
of everything that the members of a platoon carry, and the weight of each item. 
</P>
<P>
Knives, heat tabs, wristwatches, dog tags, mosquito repellent, chewing gum, 
candy, salt tablets, packets of Koolade, C-rations, water and so on -- 15 to 20 
pounds. Helmets -- 5 pounds. Boots -- 2.1 pounds. Rifle -- 8.2 pounds, loaded. 
Extra ammunition, 14 pounds. Grenade launcher, 5.9 pounds. Twenty-five grenades 
-- 16 pounds. A machine gun -- 23 pounds. A medic's kit -- 20 pounds. And then 
a host of individual choices: foot powder, canned peaches, comic books, 
condoms, dope, a Bible, a slingshot, brass knuckles. And much more. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien goes on and on, gradually extending the verb "to carry." 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers carry love letters, photos, fungus, lice and each other when 
wounded. They carry lucky charms and the thoughts they cling to. They carry 
grief, terror, confusion. And gradually, a haunting picture is assembled. 
</P>
<P>
They are as heavily equipped as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Each item has its 
purpose: for killing, protecting, preserving. Yet all the purposes add up to a 
grotesque purposelessness. These soldiers are not so much warriors as carriers 
of war, pack mules on which firepower is placed and among which a terrible 
mortality is inflicted. This absurd cargo of purposes they carry through a land 
and a war from which they are utterly divorced, and through which they move in 
a state between dream and nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
It is an ultimate, indelible image of war in our time, and in time to come.

FICTION IN BRIEF: ROOM TEMPERATURE BY NICHOLSON BAKER GROVE WEIDENFELD: $16.95;

Many look but few observe, as Sherlock Holmes noted to Dr. Watson, and a 
technical writer named Mike, the narrator of this short second novel by 
Nicholson Baker (the first was "Mezzanine"), is definitely one of the 
observers. Bottle-feeding his six-month-old daughter, nicknamed "the Bug," on a 
fall afternoon in Quincy, Mass., in the apartment he shares with his working 
wife, Patty, he asserts that "with a little concentration one's whole life 
could be reconstructed from any single 20-minute period randomly or almost 
randomly selected." He then proceeds to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Without leaving his rocking chair, Mike shuttles back and forth between his 
past as a precocious kid and college-dorm Romeo and his present as an awed new 
parent. His mode of travel is the long, intricate sentence, which he views as 
indispensable for the "careful interpretation and weighing" of "novelties of 
social and technological life." His fuel consists of details so fine, and so 
finely observed (whether of nose-picking or model airplanes, the taste of Bic 
pens or the mutual sounding-out talk of newlyweds, the clucking noises the Bug 
makes or the shape of a spoonful of peanut butter, which leads him to imagine 
impishly what his wife, when pregnant, would have looked like in a wind 
tunnel), that they give off propulsive heat and spurt the reader along with 
delicious little jolts of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
True, Mike's life is a sheltered one, and Baker is blatantly showing off (like 
a teen-ager solving quadratic equations while winning a bubble-gum-blowing 
contest). "Room Temperature" has a smug, tour de force-y quality to it. But it 
also includes some of the most tender, most delicate interaction between 
husband and wife, adult and infant, in modern fiction, demonstrating what John 
Updike, no mean observer himself, meant when he wrote of artists who imitate 
God: "Details are the giant's fingers. He seizes the stick and strips the bark 
and shows, burning beneath, the moist white wood of joy." Michael Harris

FICTION IN BRIEF: HOTEL DEATH AND OTHER TALES BY JOHN PERREAULT (SUN &amp; MOON

John Perreault's stories lead the unsuspecting reader into their maze with a 
disarmingly familiar tone. The voice of the narrator seems to be explaining his 
experiences casually, anxious that the reader understand; when he uses an 
expression like RV, for example, he explains carefully: "recreational vehicle." 
The small, unthreatening details pile up in the title story, "Hotel Death," 
until we discover that the tour guide who has led us unwary readers south of 
the border is a thief on the run. Furthermore, he is either hallucinating or a 
liar who keeps changing his story. The Hotel Descansado -- the name means 
relaxed, which "sounded good," the narrator told us early on -- turns out to be 
a nude resort. It's the sort of place where the manager is nowhere to be found, 
except possibly peering through binoculars toward the place on the beach where 
the narrator is being held up at gunpoint by banditos as he takes a stroll in 
the buff. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the stories recall Kafka in their bizarre logic based on absurd 
premises. "The game was this," begins "Airport Music," "never leave an airport 
except by plane to another airport; never go outside." The anonymous traveler 
who adheres to these rules experiences a complete life within the confines of 
airport corridors and airplane interiors until the day he disembarks and his 
deepest fears are realized: "There was no covered coupling, no sheltering ramp. 
The metal stairs at the rear of the jet led directly to the ground and the door 
to the terminal was almost six ramp-lengths away." And no matter how seemingly 
harmless and absurd, Perreault's hallucinatory worlds, like Kafka's, take no 
prisoners: "He made a run for the terminal door. . . . Suddenly he was clear of 
the airplane and the other passengers, an excellent target. A volley of gunfire 
coming from the terminal roof felled him in a roar of splintered bone and 
bursting flesh." Is this paranoid fantasy or a futuristic world of which we 
have only an incomplete view? The reader never knows for sure, but Perreault's 
vivid tales are compelling. Sonja Bolle

FICTION IN BRIEF: GOOD OLD BOY AND THE WITCH OF YAZOO BY WILLIE MORRIS

"Good Old Boy and the Witch of Yazoo" continues the adventures of the group of 
kids (and a dog) whom Willie Morris introduced in his "Good Old Boy." The 
author, a Yazoo native and former editor of Harper's who returned to live in 
Mississippi a decade ago, takes up the story a year later, when everyone is a 
little older and Rivers Applewhite, "the prettiest girl in Mississippi," just a 
little prettier. 
</P>
<P>
World War II is over; the boys feel they ought to be happy just to be alive, 
but there's still not much happening in Yazoo unless they stir up trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble presents itself in the form of a bucket of blood overflowing at the 
slaughterhouse. Ringleader Willie hits on the idea of painting witches' signs 
on the deserted Clark mansion. This the boys do, and, swearing each other to 
secrecy, go home to await the uproar. Lest the uproar should be too slow in 
coming, however, they helpfully place anonymous phone calls, alerting the most 
notorious gossips in Yazoo to the mysterious signs in blood. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble has a way of getting out of hand, and Yazoo takes up the cry of 
"witch!" as enthusiastically as any community. There is, of course, a prime 
suspect, the great-granddaughter of Yazoo's last witch. Moreover, the boys are 
stunned to see more signs appear in town -- has their mischief really placed 
them in league with the forces of evil? Willie Morris' sly psychology, 
uproarious dialogue and lyrical descriptions of Mississippi life make "The 
Witch of Yazoo" a book to read aloud, preferably to one's children. Sonja Bolle

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: FAMOUS FOR 15 MINUTES MY YEARS WITH ANDY WARHOL BY ULTRA

This chronicle of life among the denizens of Andy Warhol's famous Factory holds 
a morbid fascination for art historians -- and readers of People. Former 
"superstar" Ultra Violet (nee Isabelle Collin Dufresne) delves beneath the 
vapid surface of Warhol and his hangers-on to reveal the underlying reservoirs 
of vacuousness. 
</P>
<P>
"Famous" offers plenty of drugs and sex (although you have to read between the 
gender lines for the latter), and famous names drop like dead moths from a 
porch light. 
</P>
<P>
Warhol and his gang seem to have been driven by a desperate, almost 
pathological need for publicity: not recognition for any artistic achievement, 
but appearances in newspaper gossip columns, as if a few lines of smudged ink 
in a tabloid somehow validated their existence. "A day with no mention of 
ourselves (in the papers) is a lost day," she declares. Ultra Violet inverts 
Hannah Arendt's famous dictum and shows her readers the mind-numbing evil of 
banality.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: INTIMACY BY SUSAN CHACE (PLUME: $7.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fragmented, inconclusive novel about an alcoholic woman who somehow survives 
the disease, despite a series of weird adventures that include a suicide 
attempt and a dalliance with her brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
The narration bounces about confusingly, shifting time and voice at the drop of 
a glass. The constant switching between Mary Cronstein's version of events and 
her friends' accounts may represent an attempt to re-create the fog of acute 
alcoholism, but Susan Chace probably makes extensive use of other characters 
because Cronstein's incessant whining bores her as heartily as it does the 
reader. Critics have ceased to announce the death of the novel, but "Intimacy" 
is at least badly wounded.

Eastern Airlines took no action against a flight engineer who tested positive 
for cocaine use until managers in Miami learned seven months later he had been 
charged with buying crack, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
The test results apparently went unnoticed because of a clerical error, said 
Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak. Dain Schneemilch, 36, of Key Largo, Fla., 
was fired March 20, but the Air Line Pilots Assn. has filed a grievance to 
appeal the dismissal, she said. Schneemilch was attending ground school to 
become a co-pilot when he was arrested after allegedly buying cocaine from an 
undercover sheriff's officer, Ceremsak said. He flew no airline flights as a 
co-pilot, she said. Schneemilch has pleaded innocent to the drug charges.

Fresno County health officials said Friday they still don't know what caused 
dozens of Fresno State University dorm students to become ill this week. 
</P>
<P>
Although food poisoning has not been ruled out, officials said a team of 
investigators was not able to find a food that was eaten by all the students 
who became ill. Test results from the campus health center will be studied on 
Monday in hopes of finding the cause, which some officials think was a virus. 
Some of the 62 students became ill last Monday night and others as late as 
Tuesday night. Campus officials said there were probably more who were ill but 
did not report it.

Results of state testing of the community's five wells were relayed to the Town

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Jose Mercury News has filed a lawsuit against the former chief of the 
San Jose hotel workers union, claiming his 1983 libel lawsuit against the 
newspaper was an attempt to intimidate it and a violation of free press rights. 
The newspaper claimed the lawsuit filed by Frank Marolda damaged its reputation 
and is asking for $1 million in damages and recovery of "a significant amount" 
for legal fees, according to Mercury News attorney Edward Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of abuse of the process and malicious prosecution," Davis 
said. "The union's lawsuit was designed to send out a message to everyone else 
that if you write a negative story about the union, you're going to be in 
trouble." In late 1987, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge threw out 
Marolda's lawsuit against the paper and two reporters. Marolda, then president 
of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, Local 19, in San 
Jose, and the union objected to an article that appeared Oct. 24, 1982. The 
story described Marolda's administration of the union and his problems 
connected to a U.S. Senate investigation of labor corruption.

Caltrans' downtown Los Angeles headquarters, were chain-sawed into sawdust 
Saturday by a crew of state transportation workers. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth, a 50-footer, is destined to become mulch next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The trees weren't diseased. They didn't tangle with power lines. And, in the 
words of the man who oversaw their demise, "They're actually quite beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
They were cut down because state officials feared lawsuits might spring from 
pedestrians who have slipped on the trees' vivid-colored blooms. There was also 
concern about liability in the event someone tripped on the sidewalk buckled by 
the roots of the Chorisia-speciosa, as the trees are formally known. 
</P>
<P>
As he wistfully supervised the tree-cutting Saturday, Caltrans facilities 
manager Joe S. Loomis drew a picture of the trees' 6- to 10-inch-long bloom and 
described its threat. 
</P>
<P>
"You skate on 'em like a banana peel," said Loomis, who has fallen a few times 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
And even though the towering trees blossom for less than a month in late 
spring, "That's long enough to file a lawsuit," Loomis noted. And then there 
are seed pods the size of avocados that can drop to the sidewalk, and the woody 
thorns dotting the tree trunks. 
</P>
<P>
So, at a time when public officials from President Bush to Mayor Tom Bradley 
are encouraging widespread tree planting to beautify America and help blunt the 
"greenhouse effect," Caltrans said it has no choice but to topple the stately, 
native Brazilian trees. 
</P>
<P>
Even at that, Loomis said, the decision to destroy them was arrived at only 
after much debate. Caltrans landscapers explored moving the trees to a park 
better-suited for flowering trees, but their roots were not strong enough to 
survive a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm losing my view, too," said Loomis, 59, whose fifth-floor office overlooks 
the lawn from which some of the trees sprouted. His wife also works in the 
building, and he said she has "been all over me because this wild pack of 
parakeets won't be around anymore to peck at the seed pods." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans workers who chopped down the trees were torn about their destruction 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad, because they are perfectly healthy trees," said a worker wearing 
a hard hat, watching as two others circled the base of a tree trunk with a 
chain saw. 
</P>
<P>
Employees have repeatedly slid and fallen on the blooms, and it has only been 
"luck" that no one has sued the state. 
</P>
<P>
Planted shortly after the Caltrans building went up in 1948, the trees were 
among the earliest planted as part of a campaign launched by Los Angeles 
Beautiful, a nonprofit group that has worked toward myriad community 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"Those trees are absolutely breathtaking," Los Angeles Beautiful Director Gail 
Watson said Saturday. "You go down Spring Street and it's just beautiful. They 
brighten up a rather dark area. This whole thing is really a shame. But it's 
true. Some flowers are (more troublesome) than others, and these are very moist 
and slippery." 
</P>
<P>
There are as many as 100,000 trees in downtown Los Angeles. But, Watson said, 
"You see less and less of the flowering trees because of the liabilities 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
The good news: the silk floss trees will be replaced. The state is spending 
about $30,000 to landscape the front of the Caltrans building, adding six trees 
from the sycamore or ficus families -- species with little or no blossoms that 
stay green year-round. These trees are not as tall as their statuesque 
predecessors, but their roots ramble much less. The planting must go out to 
bid, and the sidewalks will have to be torn up to remove old roots. 
</P>
<P>
Loomis said the work should be done by late June.

THIS RIDE A CASE OF MONKEY BUSINESS

A troupe of performing chimpanzees became unwitting cohorts in a simian joy 
ride Saturday morning, when a man stole a van sitting outside a gas station in 
Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sturchen, a 30-year-old transient, was arrested on suspicion of grand 
theft auto, grand theft property and drunk driving by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies after a 15-minute chase. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies apprehended Sturchen on a dirt road west of Interstate 5, said Sgt. 
David Stunson of the Santa Clarita Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Lille, who owns the six male and female chimpanzees worth about 
$100,000, was transporting the performing animals from his Auburn-based 
business, Going Ape Animal Rental, to Los Angeles, Lille's secretary said. But 
she was uncertain where Lille was headed. 
</P>
<P>
The auto theft occurred after Lille left the keys in the ignition of his 1981 
Ford van while shopping at a Shell gas station mini-mart in the 31400 block of 
Parker Road at 2:30 a.m., Stunson said. 
</P>
<P>
When Lille returned to his car, the van was gone along with its six primate 
occupants, Stunson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lille called sheriff's deputies, who were still at the gas station when 
Sturchen drove past the mini-mart and Lille identified his van to officers, 
Stunson said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies chased the van, which was weaving erratically on the road for 
about 15 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sturchen stopped the van after the road became too steep and narrow for him to 
continue. He was ordered out of the vehicle by deputies, Stunson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the man had been drinking a bit to much," Sgt. Gary Sinclair 
said later. "It's obvious he didn't make a real successful getaway."

REJECTION OF LOAN ENDS IN DEATH, SHOOTING OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Bellflower man, irate that a plea for a loan was rejected by his half-sister 
and her husband, fatally wounded the husband at the couple's store in Artesia 
Saturday and then chased down his half-sister a short distance away, critically 
wounding her, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Sun Ki Baik, 33, fled in a 1977 Oldsmobile, prompting 
deputies to issue an all-points bulletin for his capture, said sheriff's 
spokesman Dean Scoville. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified as Kwang Kim, 49, of Cypress. His wife, Myong Kim, 
43, was rushed to Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach where she was listed 
Saturday night in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the face and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville said Baik went to the Cerritos New Market in the 19100 block of South 
Norwalk Boulevard Saturday afternoon to ask his half-sister and her husband for 
an unspecified amount of money. "It wasn't a unique request," Scoville said. 
"He had asked for money before from them." 
</P>
<P>
The couple, however, turned down the request, apparently enraging Baik, 
Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Baik pulled out a small-caliber handgun and fired, fatally 
wounding Kwang Kim in the face. 
</P>
<P>
His wife ran from the store, but was cornered by her half-brother near a home 
on 191st Street, a few doors away. There, Baik allegedly shot his half-sister 
twice, Scoville said. 
</P>
<P>
He then fled in a car with a California license of 470 SXJ, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville said anyone with additional information about the shooting should call 
sheriff's detectives.

<P>
The news from home was at least hopeful. Wayne Gretzky has improved. 
</P>
<P>
That's a lot better than the news from here, which is that the Kings, looking 
at times hopeless, will have to show a lot of improvement to seriously 
challenge the Calgary Flames in the opening round of the playoffs, beginning 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings dropped their second consecutive game Saturday night, losing to the 
Vancouver Canucks, 6-3, before a sellout Pacific Coliseum crowd of 16,123. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky remains in Los Angeles for therapy on his back, injured March 22 
against the New York Islanders. That therapy may be working, according to King 
Coach Tom Webster. 
</P>
<P>
"The muscle spasms are going away," Webster said. "He feels much better. All he 
feels now is stiffness." 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Gretzky has felt any relief from the pain caused when the 
Islanders' Alan Kerr cross-checked him from behind, sending him crashing into 
Ken Baumgartner. The result was a hyper-extension of the back. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky will continue therapy and undergo further tests Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The best-case scenario," Webster said, "is that he could join us Monday 
night." 
</P>
<P>
While the prognosis on Gretzky was good, it was bleak for defenseman Tom 
Laidlaw, also back home getting treatment for a lower back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks doubtful for the first series," Webster said. "He's not getting any 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the King difficulties in the first two periods Saturday night, when 
they fell behind, 5-2, could be attributed to their preoccupation with 
Gretzky's condition, Webster replied, "They sure as hell were thinking about 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a 1-0 shutout administered by the Winnipeg Jets Thursday night, the 
Kings fell behind Saturday 48 seconds into the game when Stan Smyl, on a 
two-on-one rush, took a pass from Brian Bradley to the right of the crease and 
blasted the puck by goalie Kelly Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
In this, the Canucks' final game of the season, Smyl had his first goal. Had 
his scoreless season become a monkey on his back? 
</P>
<P>
"I think," he said, "it was Godzilla on my back." 
</P>
<P>
On the next Canuck goal, Smyl was on the other end. He set up the score by 
digging the puck out from the end boards and getting it to Adrien Plavsic in 
the slot. From 35 feet out, Plavsic scored his third goal of the season at 
18:05. 
</P>
<P>
The assist was also a big one for Smyl. It was his 400th lifetime, making him 
the first Canuck to reach that milestone. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' Luc Robitaille reached a milestone of his own in the final period 
when he scored from the right circle. It was his team-leading 50th goal, the 
second time in his four NHL seasons he has reached that level. He finished with 
53 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not as much fun this time," said Robitaille, referring to the fact the 
goal came in a loss, "but I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
The other King goals came from Chris Kontos, his second, and Tomas Sandstrom, 
his 32nd. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the scoring for Vancouver were Garth Butcher (sixth), Paul 
Reinhart (17th), Steve Bozek (14th) and Dan Quinn (25th). 
</P>
<P>
"We are either snakebitten," Webster said, "or the other team has great 
goaltending. There were some great saves tonight, but that's what we're going 
to see in the playoffs. We just can't get it in the net." 
</P>
<P>
Especially on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
After striking out on eight power-play opportunities in the shutout by 
Winnipeg, the Kings kept their string of futility going with a one-for-five 
night against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks skated off the Coliseum ice Saturday right into a long vacation. 
Finishing the season with a 24-42-14 record, worst in the Smythe Division and 
second worst in the NHL behind the Quebec Nordiques, the Canucks will watch the 
playoffs on television. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings (34-38-7) head for Calgary, where they will close out the regular 
season today with one eye on the playoffs ahead. 
</P>
<P>
And the other on a therapy clinic in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It's awards time for the Kings. No surprise in the most valuable player 
category, as selected by the media. The winner was Wayne Gretzky, same as last 
season. Others honored were: Tim Watters (outstanding defenseman), Steve Kasper 
(best defensive player), Petr Prajsler (most improved player), Todd Elik 
(newcomer), Marty McSorley (most popular), John Tonelli (most inspirational) 
and Dave Taylor (unsung hero and best in community service) . . . Taylor also 
was named the Kings' representative in the league-wide competition for the Bill 
Masterton Memorial Award, given by the Professional Hockey Writers Assn. to the 
player deemed the NHL's good guy.

<P>
Jockey Jerry Bailey stepped out of a shower at Turfway Park and walked over to 
a television monitor to watch a rerun of Saturday's $500,000 Jim Beam Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Bailey said, "are they going to call this the Pat Day race next year?" 
</P>
<P>
Day, making his fourth appearance in the stake, had won the Kentucky Derby prep 
for the fourth time. Day abandoned his first three winners -- At the Threshold, 
J.T.'s Pet and Western Playboy -- to ride other horses in the Derby but 
probably won't this time. Summer Squall's 2 1/2-length victory on a muddy track 
stamped the $300,000 Storm Bird yearling as one of the strong favorites when 
the Triple Crown chase begins at Churchill Downs on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Although Day has ridden another Derby contender, Florida Derby winner 
Unbridled, Cot Campbell, the manager of the syndicate that owns Summer Squall, 
is confident that Day will also be his jockey for the first Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't speak for Pat," Campbell said, "but I'd bet money that he'll take our 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said that Day would contact him today or Monday with his decision. 
Both Summer Squall and Unbridled are scheduled to run in the Blue Grass Stakes 
at Keeneland on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
In what was the most impressive victory by a Kentucky Derby candidate this 
year, Summer Squall edged ahead of the pace-setting Bright Again inside the 
eighth pole and coasted to the wire with Day never resorting to his whip. The 
early fractions were good -- 1:11 2/5 for six furlongs and 1:37 2/5 for a mile 
-- and the winning time for 1 1/8 miles was 1:49 2/5, only two-fifths of a 
second off the track record. 
</P>
<P>
Bright Again, ridden by Craig Perret, finished second, eight lengths in front 
of Yonder under Bailey, and it was six lengths farther back to Power Lunch in 
fourth place. Southland-based Tight Spot finished fifth after being close to 
the pace until the top of the stretch, and he was followed by Private School, 
Top Snob, Fighting Fantasy, Sluki and Seven Spades. 
</P>
<P>
Favored by the crowd of 16,872, Summer Squall paid $3.80, $3.60 and $2.80. 
Bright Again paid $5.60 and $4.20, and Yonder returned $3.60. A $2 exacta on 
the first two finishers was worth $20.40. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the runner-up trainers thought Summer Squall's race thrust him into the 
forefront of Derby picture. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this horse was the best 2-year-old last year, and I think he's the 
best 3-year-old right now," said Rusty Arnold, who handles Bright Again. "His 
time was tremendous. My horse ran big, but the other horse was just a little 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Bright Again needs another race before the Kentucky Derby, but Arnold plans to 
avoid Summer Squall at Keeneland. Bright Again will run in the Lexington Stakes 
there April 24. 
</P>
<P>
"The winner was much the best," said Ron McAnally, Tight Spot's trainer. "He 
took mud in his face down in there all the way and still had a lot left. But 
this race isn't as much of a barometer as it might seem, because we had to run 
on an off track." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall thrives on mud. Undefeated as a 2-year-old, two of his five 
victories -- at Churchill Downs and at Saratoga -- came on off tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an edge going into this race, because we knew the horse could handle 
the mud and we had a jockey like Pat Day," said Neil Howard, Summer Squall's 
trainer. "This horse has won all over the country, so he's proved that he 
doesn't have to carry his track around with him in a suitcase. That's an 
attribute you need with a good horse, because you know you're going to be 
traveling with him." 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall earned $300,000 with his sixth victory in seven starts. His debut 
as a 3-year-old was delayed because he bled during a workout at Gulfstream 
Park, and he went 15 days without a workout. Finally, on March 17, Summer 
Squall was treated with an anti-bleeding medication, and he made his first 
start in 6 1/2 months. He finished within a length of Housebuster, one of the 
country's premier sprinters, at seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Summer Squall hadn't been around two turns until Saturday, and now the 
fidgety Howard has less of a reason to fidget. "You're never ahead of schedule 
when you're trying to get a horse ready for the Kentucky Derby," Howard said. 
"But at least I think we're on schedule with this horse now." 
</P>
<P>
Day has won many big races, but never a Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to win it eight or 10 more times," Day said of the Beam. "All of them 
are sweet, but this was the shortest-priced horse of the four, and he really 
has a great future. He was practically pulling me out of the bridle. The 
distance has never been a question in my mind, but you don't know until you put 
them to the test, and he passed it." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking from the inside post, Summer Squall dropped into third place while 
Bright Again and Tight Spot ran ahead of him. Arnold thought that Bright 
Again's chances were hurt because Tight Spot kept the pressure on his colt. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Grass, which has fallen out of favor with trainers in recent years, 
was moved to an early date last year and could be this year's strongest, 
top-to-bottom Derby prep. Just having Summer Squall and Unbridled there makes 
it a formidable race. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two horses are very close together right now," Bailey said. "I'd love to 
have the chance to pick either one of them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
After the race, Summer Squall was kicked in the rear left leg by the outrider's 
pony as he was being escorted to the winner's circle. Trainer Neil Howard said 
that Summer Squall was nicked in two spots in the upper part of the leg and 
there was a small amount of bleeding. "He's got two spots on him," Howard said. 
"One little scrape and a little place above it. The upper spot called for two 
little stitches. It was a superficial cut." 
</P>
<P>
There were surprises in two other Kentucky Derby preps Saturday. At Oaklawn 
Park, Nuits St. Georges, a colt who hadn't won a race until he beat maidens at 
Santa Anita March 4, won the Rebel while the favorite, Tarascon, finished 
third. Nuits St. George, who paid $63.80,was ridden by Jamie Bruin and is 
trained by Doug Peterson. . . . At Garden State Park, Dr. Bobby A ($15.20) won 
the Cherry Hill Mile by 6 1/2 lengths as the favorite, Smelly, finished second 
on a sloppy track.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Petr Korda fever that swept through Prague Friday night struck 
Czechoslovakian Davis Cup Captain Frantisek Pala, who was suffering the next 
morning from illusions of grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
Because Korda, the world's 26th-ranked player, played so brilliantly in a 
three-set victory over No. 5 Brad Gilbert of the United States, Pala believed 
he could put a doubles team on the court to challenge perhaps the world's 
finest pair, Rick Leach of Laguna Beach and Jim Pugh of Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Pala's team was Korda and Milan Srejber, who prolonged their agony Saturday at 
the Prague Sports Hall in a second-round Davis Cup match for only 1 hour 43 
minutes before losing. The score was as tedious as the match, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I had expected that the first- and second-best players in doubles in the world 
could play well," Pala said. "I expected that." 
</P>
<P>
So why did he waste Korda and Srejber, who must play singles today? Korda will 
meet Aaron Krickstein in the first match, and Srejber will meet Gilbert in the 
second. The United States leads, 2-1, and needs only one victory to advance to 
the semifinals in September against Austria, which eliminated Italy Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Tomas Smid, who had expected to play Saturday with Karel Novacek and 
looked disappointed when he did not, told the Czech press Thursday that Pala 
had said he would sacrifice the doubles to rest his singles players for the 
final two matches. 
</P>
<P>
"With the match tied, 1-1, you have to try everything to get the second point," 
Pala said of his change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
Korda and Srejber have had Davis Cup success as a team, beating West Germany's 
Boris Becker and Eric Jelen in five sets last year and Switzerland's Heinz 
Gunthardt and Jakob Hlasek in four sets earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
But neither victory came after Srejber had played five sets less than 24 hours 
before, as he did in a loss to Krickstein Friday night. That match included 
three tie-breakers and lasted three hours fifty-seven minutes. Considering that 
Srejber complained afterward of neck and leg pains, he did not seem a logical 
choice for doubles. 
</P>
<P>
That, no doubt, was obvious to Pala in the first game, when Srejber, a 6-foot-8 
power player who overwhelmed Krickstein with his serve in the first set Friday 
night, was broken by Leach and Pugh. 
</P>
<P>
Thus was established a pattern that continued throughout the match. The first 
time Srejber served in each set, the Czechs lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I was tired," Srejber said. "On the other hand, my opponents 
returned serves very well. I have never, ever played against such good 
returners." 
</P>
<P>
Once they broke Srejber early in each set, Leach and Pugh could coast. The only 
time the U.S. pair faltered was when Leach lost his serve in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
It was quick work for Leach and Pugh, playing only their second Davis Cup match 
since replacing the long-time U.S. pair of Ken Flach and Robert Seguso earlier 
this year against Mexico at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
This was their first real test because they were playing away from home, where 
Davis Cup crowds are notoriously hostile to visitors. But Leach and Pugh were 
so dominant that the Czech crowd of about 14,000 never got into the match. 
</P>
<P>
The fans could be heard only when derisively whistling at Srejber. 
</P>
<P>
Now that newly democratic Czechoslovakia has free speech, Pala said he expects 
Smid to say, "I told you so." 
</P>
<P>
"Tomas Smid is not one to be afraid to say what he wants to say," Pala said. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt looking forward to appearing solo again, Korda was almost smug when 
asked what kind of match he expects against Krickstein, ranked seventh in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"That's up to Aaron Krickstein, not me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Srejber, ranked 59th, understandably was less secure when asked whether he 
expects to be ready for Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
"We shall see," he said.

Ara Parseghian, former Notre Dame football coach, is proud of his name, but he 
admits life would have been simpler had he been named Smith or Jones. 
</P>
<P>
He told Gus Schrader of the Cedar Rapids Gazette: "Most people have trouble 
remembering the name Parseghian. So I told one emcee how to remember it. The 
first syllable is 'Par,' so remember golf. The second syllable is 'segh,' as in 
Seagrams. The third syllable is 'yan,' like a Chinese name. 
</P>
<P>
"When the guy introduced me, he said, 'I can't remember his name, but here is 
that drunken Chinese golfer.' " 
</P>
<P>
What a memory: Phil Rizzuto and Bill White, now president of the National 
League, had some memorable exchanges when they shared a radio booth at Yankee 
Stadium. The death of former major league manager Johnny Neun last week brought 
to mind this exchange: 
</P>
<P>
White: "I think Johnny Neun used to be a Yankee manager." 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto: "You must be kidding. I didn't know that." 
</P>
<P>
(Neun managed the Yankees for 14 games in 1946. The shortstop was Phil 
Rizzuto.) 
</P>
<P>
Add exchanges: Rizzuto: "Reggie's home run has gone clear out of the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
White: "Actually, Scooter, that ball landed in the seats." 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto: "It doesn't matter. They can't see it anyway at home." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What major league pitcher threw the most shutouts in the 1980s? 
(Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Big difference: From Walter Matthau, claiming that baseball players have it all 
wrong when they compare themselves to actors: "In the movies, the stars get all 
the money. The others get scale." 
</P>
<P>
What a pair: Said Stacey King of the Chicago Bulls after Wednesday night's 
victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, "I'll always remember this as the night 
that Michael Jordan and I combined for 70 points." 
</P>
<P>
King scored one point. 
</P>
<P>
Last straw: Do you understand the complicated formula the NFL uses to rate its 
quarterbacks? Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg Times doesn't either, but he 
said, "If you need further proof that it's the most stupid statistic in the 
history of sports, try this one: Tony Eason has replaced Johnny Unitas in the 
top 20 of the all-time ratings." 
</P>
<P>
Firing back: Before Jose Canseco and the Oakland Athletics came to terms, 
General Manager Sandy Alderson said that if they went to arbitration the club 
would bring up Canseco's off-field escapades. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco told the New York Times: "I don't think that what I do off the field is 
Sandy Alderson's business. I told him, 'Why don't you get the Pope to play 
right field. See if you can win the World Series then.' " 
</P>
<P>
Power mad: If you had a .352 lifetime batting average, would you tinker with 
your swing? Wade Boggs would, and is. 
</P>
<P>
He's studying tapes from the 1987 season when he hit 24 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a sweet swing that year and I lost it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he's getting it back. The next night he slugged a grand slam against the 
Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Fernando Valenzuela, 27.

PADRES MIGHT BE PURCHASED ON MONDAY, SOURCE SAYS

<P>
It appears that baseball's longest-running soap opera finally will have its own 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are expected to announce as early as Monday that the club will be 
sold for $75 million to television producer Tom Werner of Los Angeles and nine 
limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
The sale almost was completed a week ago, but a glitch occurred, a source close 
to the investment group said Saturday. However, the source said a letter of 
intent might be signed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Padre owner Joan Kroc and chief executive Jerry Kapstein declined to comment, 
but a member of the group, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said 
that the deal is in its final stages. 
</P>
<P>
Werner, 39, a partner in Carsey-Werner Co., which produces "The Cosby Show" and 
"Roseanne" among other TV shows, would be the managing general partner of the 
Padres if the sale is completed. Yet sources in the group said Werner will own 
less than 50% of the club. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthiest of the group, sources said, is Ernest Rady of San Diego, 
chairman of the American Assets and Insurance Co. of the West. The others 
include: Scott Wolfe, a partner in the law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins, which 
put the group together; Russell Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive officer 
of Republic Pictures and a director of City National Bank in Beverly Hills; 
Arthur Rivkin, former president of Coca-Cola Bottling of San Diego; Leon Parma, 
president and owner of Coast Distributing Co., who also is a major stockholder 
in the La Jolla Bank and Trust; Arthur Engel, president of Southwest Marine 
Inc.; Jackson W. Goodall, CEO and chairman of Foodmaker Inc; L. Robert Payne, 
president of Mission Valley Associates Inc and part-owner of the Doubletree 
Hotel; and Malin Burnham, chairman of First National Bank and John Burnham and 
Co.

EXTENUATING: Richard Moss, the agent for Nolan Ryan, discussed a possible 
contract extension with the Texas Rangers the other day. Ryan, 43, previously 
indicated that the 1990 season would probably be his last. He is still 
concerned, he said, about his ability to maintain a high performance standard 
through the life of an extension, but he added: "I'd be lying if I told you 
those $3-million contracts didn't get my attention. I'd be lying if I told you 
that (the possible offering of an extension by the Rangers) wouldn't affect my 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
TURNOVER: The Baltimore Orioles have continued the process that began last 
year. Their 39-man roster averages 26 years 9 months, second-youngest in the 
American League to the Toronto Blue Jays' average of 25 years 9 months. Of the 
39 players, 28 have fewer than three years' major league service, and only Cal 
Ripken Jr. remains from the 1986 team. 
</P>
<P>
TIGHTENING HIS BELT: The Kansas City Royals' George Brett has lost 30 pounds 
since Dec. 1. Brett said he became obsessed with a conditioning program after 
hitting what he considered an embarrassing .280 last season. "I used to be able 
to get two hours' sleep, come to the park with a headache and still get three 
hits," he said. "I can't do that anymore. I've tried, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
BUTLER DID IT: The crackdown on oversized gloves was certain to snare San 
Francisco Giants center fielder Brett Butler, who told Bay Area reporters: "The 
way it is now, my gamer is illegal and it's one I've used for six years. I 
guess I better call Mizuno and have them make me a Little League model." 
</P>
<P>
WOUNDED: The Milwaukee Brewers, besieged by injuries last season, are back at 
it. Shortstop Bill Speiers, coming off shoulder surgery, sprained an ankle in 
the first exhibition game, and third baseman Paul Molitor received an injection 
for shoulder soreness. Second baseman Jim Gantner, who had major knee surgery, 
will not be ready for opening day, but first baseman Greg Brock will, despite 
recent shoulder surgery. General Manager Harry Dalton calls it his All-Scar 
infield and said he was hoping the 27-man roster went through, because "we were 
thinking about using those spots to carry three doctors." 
</P>
<P>
ADD BREWERS: There's one plus, at least. Infielder Dale Sveum, who broke a leg 
on Sept. 3, 1988, and did not play last season, has made an unexpectedly strong 
comeback this spring and may open at second base. 
</P>
<P>
TORTURE: Reflecting on the Angels' four-game exhibition series against San 
Diego in Yuma, Ariz., Giant coach Dusty Baker said: "That's brutal. I wouldn't 
even send Noreiga to Yuma for four days." ROSS NEWHAN

WINFIELD ANSWERS SOFTLY WHEN QUESTION IS ABOUT TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Winfield has spent too many years working for New York Yankee owner George 
Steinbrenner to discuss the possibility of a trade to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
He knows that saying the wrong thing at the wrong time can produce more turmoil 
for him, and he already believes that no player -- aside from Jackie Robinson 
-- has ever been through more. 
</P>
<P>
At 38 and having missed the entire 1989 season because of back surgery, 
Winfield is confident that he will regain his All-Star form in 1990 and carry 
it beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe even as far as Anaheim? Would he like that? Would he approve a trade 
involving the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
He smiled and said: 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can tell you is that I'm going to play five more years and 
believe I can still play 155 games a year at my previous level. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win. I want to have fun. I don't want to be abused." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Jeff Klein, provided some additional insight. 
</P>
<P>
"The Angels are obviously a good team in a strong division, and they've 
evidenced a commitment to winning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave enjoys the environment. He and his wife (Tonya) live there (in Beverly 
Hills). He thinks it's a nice place to play and that the ball carries well at 
the Big A. Other than that, it's hard to respond to rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, Dave is not looking to leave New York. He's been great for the city, 
and the city has been great to him." 
</P>
<P>
As a player with 10 or more seasons in the major leagues and five or more with 
the same team, Winfield's consent is necessary for any trade. He said he has 
not been approached regarding the Angels, though the respective general 
managers acknowledge they have talked. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, with a surplus of starting pitchers, are pursuing a run-producing 
outfielder or a bona fide leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The list is believed to include Von Hayes, Rob Deer, Lenny Dykstra, Tim Raines, 
Cory Snyder and Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, in turn, need pitching. Their rotation, so to speak, includes 
Pascual Perez, Tim Leary, Andy Hawkins and some mystery guests. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are believed to have offered Mike Witt, but Steinbrenner, despite 
his well-documented dislike for Winfield, said publicly the other day that he 
has no interest in Witt, whom he once pursued as a free agent but who was 22-31 
over the last two years and may lack the temperament to pitch in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
The question then becomes: 
</P>
<P>
Would the Angels deal Kirk McCaskill, knowing it would also cost them a buyout 
of Winfield's veto rights and renegotiation of a contract that expires at the 
end of the 1990 season, when Winfield can become a free agent? 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons to believe they will seriously consider it. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is mutual respect between Winfield and General Manager Mike Port, 
both of whom were with the San Diego Padres in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because of his athleticism, age may not be the deterrent it is with some 
other players. In 1988, at 36, Winfield had one of his best seasons, batting 
.322 with 25 homers and 107 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Amid nine years of almost constant turmoil with the Yankees, Winfield has 
displayed leadership, stability and fortitude, qualities that a team would seem 
to want. 
</P>
<P>
First, of course, Winfield must prove to Angel scouts -- former manager Cookie 
Rojas, among them -- that he is physically sound. 
</P>
<P>
The process is accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield served as a designated hitter Thursday, his first competitive 
appearance since September of '88. He is expected to play the outfield today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be ready opening day, I guarantee it," he said. "Physically, I'm there, 
but it takes awhile to get the synchronization and coordination (at the plate). 
The hits will come, the confidence will come. I'm glad to be part of it again." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield had fragments of a herniated disk removed by Dr. Robert Watkins at 
Centinela Hospital Medical Center after the stiffness he began experiencing 
during a four-hour bus ride in the spring of 1988 turned to pain last spring. 
</P>
<P>
He rehabilitated with weights and exercise, and believes that the summer out of 
uniform might have been mentally therapeutic as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be there, but I didn't allow myself to ride an emotional roller 
coaster," he said. "I tried to avoid feelings of frustration. I tried to stay 
on an even keel. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, the way I look at it, I added a year to my career." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield won't make an issue of it, but he is obviously displeased that the 
Yankees are moving him from right field to left, leaving Jesse Barfield in 
right and Roberto Kelly in center. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield and Winfield each believes he is baseball's best right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like if they wanted Kareem to play guard when he was the best center in 
basketball," Winfield said, forcing a smile. "What could he do? He'd play 
guard." 
</P>
<P>
No one was more surprised by the Yankees' $5.7-million signing of the eccentric 
Pascual Perez than Buck Rodgers, his former manager with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a sick man, a time bomb," Rodgers said. "He wants to do well and stay 
clean, but he needs help." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, Rodgers said, provided that help during Perez's drug rehabilitation, 
then were snubbed when he left as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"After you take a guy out of the gutter, you would think he would want to come 
back, but his agent didn't even give us a second chance after he got the offer 
from New York," Rodgers said, adding that Perez figures to be immune to the 
pressures of Steinbrenner and Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's going to bother Pascual because he's in his own world," Rodgers 
said. "It doesn't matter if he's pitching in Des Moines, Iowa, or New York 
City." 
</P>
<P>
One of the pivotal questions of the abbreviated spring for the New York Mets 
concerned the ability of former infielder Keith Miller to play center field, 
allowing Kevin McReynolds to remain in left and Mike Marshall to move from the 
outfield to first base. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to another former infielder who played center field for the Mets last 
year, Manager Davey Johnson said of Miller: 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's going to be better than Juan Samuel was. I look for him to be a 
spark for us. I look for him to hit .250 and do the little things. He's going 
to help get us going. What he hits is not as important as his enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Ripken, the Baltimore Oriole shortstop, remains frustrated over the 
September slump that might have cost his surprising team the American League 
East championship and enabled Robin Yount to win the most-valuable-player 
award. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken hit .198 in September. He also slumped in September of 1988, batting 
.216, but he does not believe that the late collapses are a result of fatigue 
from his streak of consecutive games, now at 1,250. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to contribute. I wanted to drive in runs. I wanted to help us win so 
badly that I fell back into the same bad habits," Ripken said of last September 
as it related to the previous September. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I could hit balls out of the strike zone. The word travels pretty 
quickly when they're getting you out that way. If you're stubborn enough and 
dumb enough to keep doing it, they'll keep doing it, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Braves have converted their succession of early draft choices into 
what Don Sutton, now doing color commentary on Atlanta telecasts, calls the 
most talented collection of young pitchers he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton is particularly high on 19-year-old Steve Avery, 19-8 in two minor 
league seasons after being selected third in the 1988 draft. 
</P>
<P>
"Avery is an absolute franchise pitcher," Sutton said. "He has the best 
mechanics of any young pitcher I've seen in 25 years. The Braves ought to hire 
a sniper so that they can pick off anybody that tries to change him. Just leave 
him alone." 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Fielder, who played for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan last year, was 
immediately named cleanup hitter by Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson 
Wednesday when he hit home runs on three consecutive pitches by three St. Louis 
Cardinal pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder has never been to bat more than 176 times in a major league season, but 
as Cardinal catcher Tom Pagnozzi said of the hefty DH: 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like King Kong today. He was King Kong. You think Sparky will have 
him in the Hall of Fame tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a 27 player roster over the first 21 days of the season has 
been reborn. Despite Wednesday's contrary directive from the owners' Player 
Relations Committee, negotiations have resumed in New York concerning the 
roster issue. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows yet whether clubs will open with 27, 25 or 24 players, but the 
fact that a simple issue has become so complicated illustrates that the 
relationship between management and players will never be free of greed and 
selfishness. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis Manager Whitey Herzog said rescinding the 27-man roster represented 
the silliest decision ever. 
</P>
<P>
"For the good of the game they ought to let the people on the field start 
making decisions again," he said. "We play 20 straight days starting with the 
fourth day of the season, and I may use 90 to 100 pitchers in those 20 games. 
You may see teams get buried, key pitchers hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope none of mine do. But if some of the Mets do, well . . ."

NEWSWIRE: NORRIS KNOCKS OUT MUGABI, TAKES TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Norris floored John Mugabi 90 seconds into the fight and took Mugabi's 
World Boxing Council super welterweight title Saturday with a knockout at 2:47 
of the first round at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Mugabi got up the first time at the count of eight and looked as if he might 
survive the round. But Norris, 153 3/4 pounds, hurt the champion again with a 
straight right and unleashed another right that sent Mugabi down to stay about 
15 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Mugabi is 37-3, including 1986 losses to Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Duane 
Thomas. Norris is 25-3 with 14 knockouts.

AUGMON ACCOMPLISHES TASK: RENDERING WEAPON HARMLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

DENVER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Stacey Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas is always assigned to check the 
toughest opposing player. When UNLV faced Georgia Tech in an NCAA tournament 
semifinal game Saturday, he was assigned to Dennis Scott, the top gun in 
Georgia Tech's Lethal Weapon 3 offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big challenge," Augmon said. "I knew he was looking forward to 
playing against me and he took the challenge and came out launching. I couldn't 
stop him in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
Scott scored 20 points in the first 20 minutes as Georgia Tech took a 53-46 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Augmon limited Scott to nine points in the second half as the Rebels won, 
90-81, to advance to the NCAA championship game Monday night against Duke. 
</P>
<P>
"Stacey played great defense in the second half," guard Anderson Hunt said. "He 
knew what he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
What Augmon had to do was play more aggressively against Scott. 
</P>
<P>
After making five of eight shots in the first half, including four three-point 
shots, Scott didn't touch the ball in the first five minutes of the second half 
because of Augmon. "He played great defense on me the second half," Scott said. 
"He denied me the ball. I think the whole Vegas team was denying us the ball 
and it got us out of our offense." 
</P>
<P>
Although Augmon did a good job on Scott in the second half, he thought he could 
have done a better job in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott's a great player," Augmon said. "You can't take anything from him. He 
still got 29. The thing I tried to do was hold him to the lowest possible 
points. I can't go out and stop anyone. Great players are going to hit shots on 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
But Tarkanian thought Augmon was being too modest. 
</P>
<P>
"In all fairness to Stacey, Scott got quite a few of his points when we were in 
our zone," Tarkanian said. "It seemed like every time we went to a zone he hit 
a three-pointer and made us pay for it. I don't know how many he got directly 
off Stacey, but I'm sure half of them came off our zone." 
</P>
<P>
As the Rebels' best defensive player, Augmon said he takes more pride in his 
defense than his offense. And he has shut down some of the nation's best 
offensive players, such as Temple guard Mark Macon, who had 11 points before 
fouling out in a loss to UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Although Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins praised the aggressive defense Augmon 
played on Scott, he felt Scott stopped himself in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Stacey couldn't stop Dennis Scott overall," Cremins said. "He's a heck 
of a defender, but no one can stop Dennis Scott. The only one who can stop 
Dennis Scott is Dennis Scott. But Augmon is a good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
After opening the game in a zone defense, UNLV switched to a man-to-man defense 
at the start of the second half. The defense seemed to confuse Georgia Tech, 
which shot 66.7% in the first half. The Yellow Jackets shot just 34.5% in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the second half we played really well defensively," Tarkanian said. 
"We got after it real good and we shut down a lot of things. The first half we 
didn't play with the intensity we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels opened the second half with a 17-4 run as Augmon scored five points. 
While Augmon is recognized for his defense, he also is a good offensive player 
as he proved last Sunday by scoring 33 points against Loyola Marymount and 
Saturday with 22 against Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
"I take more pride in my defense than my offense," Augmon said. "A lot of 
people say I should take more pride in my offense because it will take me 
farther in life. 
</P>
<P>
"But my role on this team is as the defensive stopper and to put a little 
points on the board and that's what I did. I enjoy playing defense." 
</P>
<P>
While UNLV's defense might have been the key, the Rebels' perimeter offense 
came to the fore after Georgia Tech made a run late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's sagging defense took away UNLV's inside game as forward Larry 
Johnson got into foul trouble. But the Rebels picked up their outside game, 
making 10 of 15 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who had 20 points, broke out of a slump by making five of nine 
three-point shots and Greg Anthony made three of four and scored 14 points.

When Jim Grabb is serving well, it doesn't matter who is on the receiving end. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Grabb, ranked 35th in the world, showed that Saturday when he defeated 
top-ranked Ivan Lendl, 6-3, 6-4, in the semifinals of the Volvo tournament at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm serving well, I can beat anybody in the world," Grabb said. "I've 
beaten (Mats) Wilander, (John) McEnroe and (Michael) Chang, and had a close 
call with (Stefan) Edberg, all great players." 
</P>
<P>
Grabb advances to today's final against Chang, who beat Richey Reneberg, 7-6 
(8-6), 0-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Grabb played Lendl once before, losing at San Francisco in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have a few more skills now," said Grabb, who had nine aces. "I'm 
serving better, and I just felt better prepared this time."

BROWN BESS REMAINS A GOLDEN GIRL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heading down to the track after the $212,000 Santa Barbara Handicap Saturday at 
Santa Anita, owner Suzanne Pashayan was pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after Brown Bess, her Eclipse Award winner, had finished third, 
beaten by a head, in the Santa Ana Handicap, Pashayan thought the 8-year-old 
mare had come up short in the photo again. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she had lost it," she said. "All the way down, I kept saying she had 
lost it by a nose." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the Brown Bess camp assured Pashayan otherwise. They proved correct. 
</P>
<P>
In becoming the oldest mare to win a stake at Santa Anita -- and, perhaps, the 
oldest to win a Grade I anywhere -- Brown Bess edged Royal Touch by a nose. 
Double Wedge, a 29-1 shot, was another head back in third. 
</P>
<P>
Until a week ago, the Santa Barbara wasn't in trainer Chuck Jenda's plans. 
Then, Brown Bess worked a mile in 1:39 2/5 last Sunday at Golden Gate, and the 
decision was made to bring her south for her second start of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The high weight at 123 pounds, Brown Bess scored her 16th victory in 32 starts 
and increased her earnings to more than $1.2 million. She covered 1 1/4 miles 
in 1:58 2/5, her 13th victory in 21 turf races. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Touch, the 8-5 second choice, joined the 7-10 favorite with about three 
furlongs to run, and they were never separated by more than a half-length 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"That was scary," Jenda said. "It was too close to call. They were hanging up 
some pretty fast fractions, and I didn't know how well she'd finish off that 
pace. They went a mile in 1:34 and that's fast on any surface. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we're here is that she's done well since her last race. She 
trained brilliantly, too good to pass this up. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll definitely give her some time off now. She'll get at least a month. 
There are a couple of races up north. The Yerba Buena (1 3/8 miles) is about 
six weeks from now, so the timing would be just about right. There's also the 
Golden Gate Handicap (in which she would go against males)." 
</P>
<P>
Not even jockey Jack Kaenel was sure whether Brown Bess had won or lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea," Kaenel said. "I was talking to Russell Baze (Royal Touch's 
rider), and neither one of us had a strong opinion on who had won. 
</P>
<P>
"She improved quite a bit off her last race. It was a game effort last time, 
but she just got flat tired. She went an eighth farther, held on better and 
only had three weeks since her last race. 
</P>
<P>
"She never gives up. She gives you all she has all the time. She's just a 
pleasant horse to ride." 
</P>
<P>
Royal Touch has to qualify as one of the meeting's unluckiest performers. She 
was beaten by a head by the now-retired Annoconnor in the Santa Ana after 
having some trouble, then she missed by inches Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"She hit the wire on the wrong part of her stride," Baze said. "We were trading 
the lead with every head bob. Otherwise, she had a perfect trip." 
</P>
<P>
Winless since March 10 of last year, Double Wedge was getting 12 pounds from 
the winner and 10 from Royal Touch. 
</P>
<P>
"He (trainer Bobby Frankel) told me to let her break and sit close to the 
pace," said jockey Robbie Davis. "We were sitting right there. (Brown Bess and 
Royal Touch) moved down the backside and I had nowhere to go. I just made one 
move with her and she came running." 
</P>
<P>
Estrealla Fuega was fourth, nearly three lengths behind Double Wedge, then came 
Isabella Ra, who showed the way through fractions of :22 2/5, :45 and 1:10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Even when the result of the photo was posted, Suzanne Pashayan still wasn't 
sure Brown Bess was the winner. "Even the numbers came up on the board, I was 
trying to make something else out of the '2,' " she said. . . . There was a 
minus show pool in the Santa Barbara of $1,274.99. . . . The Bill Spawr-Pat 
Valenzuela combination continued to sizzle Saturday when Sperry won the fifth 
race. Spawr has won with 20 of 60 starters at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, seven 3-year-olds are probable for the Santa Anita Derby 
Saturday, led by the unbeaten Mister Frisky. Those scheduled to oppose him in 
the 1 1/8-mile race are Real Cash, Music Prospector, Warcraft, Video Ranger, 
Assyrian Pirate and Balla Cove. . . . Santa Anita Handicap winner Ruhlmann and 
runner-up Criminal Type will meet again today in the $420,800 San Bernardino 
Handicap at a 1 1/8 miles on the main track. Besides Ruhlmann, trainer Charlie 
Whittingham will also be represented by Lively One and Payant. Annual Date and 
Stylish Winner complete the field for the Grade II event.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: SOCIAL SECURITY'S ROLE IN WIFE'S BACK-TO-WORK 
DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My wife has been a homemaker for more than 25 years. She is 60 years 
old and is thinking of returning to work. She would be entitled to receive 
about $240 a month in Social Security benefits at age 65 based on her previous 
employment. If she returns to work and earns $30,000 a year for the next five 
years, would her Social Security benefits increase significantly? What if she 
remains at home? Is she entitled to some sort of benefits for homemakers who 
have not been part of the work force for a long time? -- C.F.L. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes, if your wife does return to work for the next five years and earns 
about $30,000 per year, the amount of Social Security benefits she will be 
entitled to receive at age 65 should be greater than what she is currently 
entitled to receive based on her earnings more than 25 years ago. The reason is 
quite simple: When your wife was in the work force 25 or more years ago, her 
contributions to Social Security were so small that she is entitled to a 
relatively low monthly benefit. If she begins earning $30,000 per year, her 
annual contributions to Social Security will be about $2,995, at the current 
withholding rate of 7.65% of earnings. And this amount will be matched by her 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
However, before your wife rushes back into the work force, let's explore all 
the angles. Of course, if your wife wants to return to work for the 
satisfaction a job offers, that's one thing. But if she's taking a job solely 
to increase her Social Security benefits, there are other factors to consider. 
When your wife turns 65, she is entitled to receive spousal Social Security 
benefits in an amount equal to 50% of your benefits at age 65. She could begin 
drawing these benefits when she turns age 65, provided that you have retired 
and have begun receiving your Social Security benefits. (She could also begin 
receiving spousal benefits at age 62, but they would be lower than if she waits 
until age 65.) 
</P>
<P>
You have not provided us with sufficient information to evaluate what course of 
action you should take. However, if you were in the highest Social Security 
taxation bracket throughout your working career -- and therefore eligible for 
the highest monthly benefit -- your wife's spousal benefits might be higher 
than anything she could qualify for on her own. 
</P>
<P>
To find out where you stand and what course of action you should pursue, you 
should find out how much Social Security you are entitled to receive and 
compare half that amount to your wife's current entitlement of $240 per month 
and whatever amount she would be entitled to receive if she earned $30,000 
annually for the next five years. You probably will need the help of your local 
Social Security office to complete your analysis. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, all taxpayers should know that there is a fairly easy way to find 
out whether your Social Security account is at the level it should be and how 
much you can expect to receive from Social Security upon retirement. Simply 
call (800) 937-2000. This toll-free number has been set aside exclusively for 
telephone requests for Social Security Form SSA-7004, "Personal Earnings and 
Benefit Estimate." If you have difficulty getting through on the line, try the 
general Social Security request line, (800) 234-5SSA, and ask for the same 
form. 
</P>
<P>
When you get the form, which asks your birth date, Social Security number and a 
few other questions, complete it and mail it back to the enclosed address. The 
Social Security Administration will then send you a listing of your Social 
Security-qualified employment earnings and expected retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
If you think there is an error in the information, you should contact your 
local Social Security office. Be prepared to show agency officials appropriate 
tax returns or earnings statements to support your position. Agency officials 
say they cannot guarantee that they will be able to correct mistakes made more 
than three years earlier, and that's why they recommend filing Form SSA-7004 
every three years. 
</P>

Pointers for Grandkids Before They Sell Stock 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you give me a few rules of thumb to consider when evaluating the sale of 
stock with large gains subject to tax? I gave our grandchildren shares of stock 
many years ago that are now worth nearly four times their original cost. I want 
to help them avoid any unwise cashing in of these shares. -- R.C.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: You no doubt know by now that the most you can offer your grandchildren is 
some grandfatherly advice; what they choose to do with the stock you gave them 
as a gift is their business. However, with that in mind, our advisers say you 
should ask your grandchildren to thoroughly consider the following points 
before selling their shares: 
</P>
<P>
Do they really need the money? If not, there's little reason to incur a large 
tax bill to generate some extra cash. 
</P>
<P>
If they need the money, then the shares with the highest tax basis -- if any -- 
should be sold first to minimize the taxable gain. (Remember, taxable gain is 
determined by subtracting the tax basis, usually the original per-share cost, 
from the net sales price.) 
</P>
<P>
Sale of the stock should ideally be timed for a year in which your 
grandchildren's income is lower than usual -- or their tax deductions are 
higher than usual. This, too, will minimize the tax bite. For example, if they 
have capital losses from investments one year, that could be the year to sell 
the shares to shelter some of the gain. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if they use proceeds from the stock sale to purchase their first home, 
they should, ideally, time the stock sale to coincide with the first full year 
of mortgage interest payments to shelter as much of the stock sale gain as 
possible with the large amount of deductible mortgage interest.

IRS' Double Standard on Sales to Relatives 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago, my husband and I purchased land in Colorado that is now 
worth a fraction of its original cost. Can we sell it to our son at its current 
market value and recognize a loss for tax purposes? -- D.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The Internal Revenue Service does not allow tax losses on transactions 
between relatives. However, if you sell an asset to a relative at a gain, the 
IRS recognizes that profit and taxes you on it.

Too Late to Escape Real Estate Gains Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q: Ten years ago, I entered into an installment sale of some real estate 
specifically to defer paying taxes -- then assessed at 20% for long-term gains 
-- on my profit. The note will be paid off later this year, and because of tax 
law changes, it looks as though I will pay at least 28% tax on my gain. It 
appears I outsmarted myself! Is there a "grandfather" program that would allow 
one to apply the tax rate that was in effect at the time of the original 
transaction? Obviously, had I known then of the changes forthcoming, I would 
not have done what I did. -- M.D.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: Unfortunately, you did outsmart yourself. Nothing in the tax code would 
allow you now to select the tax rate in effect when you originally sold the 
real estate. You are stuck, something that you usually can't avoid when tax 
laws change and your crystal ball isn't tuned into divining how Congress will 
handle the thorny issues of tax reform.

ANC SUSPENDS MEETING WITH S. AFRICA LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The African National Congress announced Saturday that it has suspended plans 
for its historic first meeting with the South African government in protest 
over the "unprovoked killing and maiming of defenseless demonstrators" by 
police in Sebokeng township last week. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government talks about negotiations on the one hand and murders our 
people on the other -- that we cannot accept," Nelson R. Mandela, the ANC 
deputy president, told a rally Saturday. "These conditions do not create a 
climate conducive to negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The surprise announcement threatened to scuttle one of the most important 
meetings in South African history, the April 11 talks in Cape Town between ANC 
leaders and President Frederik W. de Klerk's white-led government. The two 
sides had agreed to meet to discuss hurdles to negotiations on black 
power-sharing and settlement of South Africa's racial conflict. 
</P>
<P>
It also reflected growing disarray within the ANC leadership, which has been 
unable to assert firm control over its grass-roots supporters, many of whom 
oppose negotiations with the government. Internal ANC leaders had earlier said 
the increasing township violence would not derail the planned talks, but local 
activists successfully pressured the ANC to change its mind. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said he would study the report on the police action in Sebokeng, where 
officers killed at least eight blacks Monday. But the president told a party 
gathering Saturday night that even if the criticism of police was justified, 
the ANC should not have withdrawn from the scheduled talks, which would be the 
type of dialogue that could prevent similar incidents in the future. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's liberal political opponents, the Democratic Party, agreed that the 
incidents in Sebokeng did not warrant cancellation of the ANC-government 
meeting. The Democrats also urged the government to appoint a judicial 
commission, with both government and ANC members, to investigate police 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC decision, relayed by Mandela to De Klerk on Friday, came five days 
after the bloody unrest in Sebokeng, a black township about 30 miles south of 
Johannesburg. The trouble began when police confronted tens of thousands of 
blacks marching to protest high rents and poor living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A judge had denied permission for the march and, as volunteer marshals talked 
with the crowd, the police opened fire with shotguns, killing at least five 
people and injuring several hundred. More than 10 other people were killed, at 
least three of them by police, in the resulting violence that flared throughout 
the township. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, in the statement issued Saturday from its headquarters in Lusaka, 
Zambia, said the Sebokeng killings marked the third fatal police attack on 
"peaceful demonstrations against the injustices of apartheid" in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the present circumstances, (we) consider it ill-advised to proceed with 
arrangements to meet De Klerk and his colleagues on April 11. Effective from 
this moment, all arrangements for this meeting are suspended," the ANC said. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC said it will review its decision within five days. In the meantime, it 
said, the South African authorities should show their commitment to peace by 
"taking demonstrative action to bring the trigger-happy police, vigilantes and 
other perpetrators of this violence to justice with all deliberate speed." 
</P>
<P>
Although Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has said he regretted the deaths 
in Sebokeng, he and other government officials have consistently expressed 
public support for police officers. Police in the neighboring township of 
Sharpeville used tear gas to break up a similar demonstration on the same day 
without loss of life. And large, legal marches in South African townships later 
in the week were peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also has expressed concern about an upsurge of violence in South 
African townships since the ANC was legalized on Feb. 2 and Mandela was freed 
from prison on Feb. 11. The number of incidents of unrest recorded by police 
have soared almost to the levels of the turbulent 1984-86 period. 
</P>
<P>
Despite ANC leaders' calls for peace, its supporters have been responsible for 
some of the trouble, De Klerk has said. And he blames the ANC's refusal to 
renounce its 30-year armed struggle, which has been mostly dormant in recent 
months. If the violence continues, the president said, the government "will be 
obliged to use its full power to restore law and order." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid leaders have generally welcomed government moves to allow some 
black marches and demonstrations, most of which have been peaceful. But 
activists have bristled at judicial orders banning other such protests. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of South Africa have the right to assemble and demonstrate in 
support of their just demands," the ANC said. "We claim this as an inalienable 
right, not as a favor conceded by the regime at its discretion." 
</P>
<P>
As the primary group fighting the white minority-led government, the ANC is 
considered a key player in any negotiations on South Africa's future. De Klerk 
wants to launch negotiations with the ANC and other leaders of the black 
majority to draw up a new constitution that will end white-minority domination 
and give blacks a vote in national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has met several of the conditions of the ANC, and the two sides agreed 
last month to meet to discuss the two remaining ANC conditions -- release of 
all political prisoners and lifting of the 45-month-old state of emergency. 
Both sides announced names of those in their delegations last week, and the 
talks appeared to be on track until Saturday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC said its decision was made by the 35-member national executive 
committee, which operates in exile, after consulting with Mandela, Walter 
Sisulu and other internal ANC leaders who are preparing for the exiles' return. 
</P>
<P>
Many black rivals of the ANC, and even some ANC supporters, are wary of De 
Klerk's promises and are opposed to negotiations with the government until the 
pillars of apartheid, including segregation of neighborhoods, schools and 
hospitals, have been removed.

OLD TIRES HAVE LONG BEEN AN ENVIRONMENTAL PAIN IN THE NECK. DESPITE SHREDDING, 
CHOPPING, GRINDING, BURNING, BURYING AND DUMPING, THEY'RE A BIGGER NUISANCE 
THAN EVER.

<TEXT>
<P>
In his relentless celebration of American folkways, Norman Rockwell transformed 
derelict automobile tires into little petunia beds and children's swings -- 
testament to Yankee thrift and the creativity of ordinary folks who extracted 
their last nickel's worth. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, nobody else has so deftly dispatched worn-out tires into a useful 
hereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Long a national nuisance, they are piling up across the country faster than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
From coast to coast, they are being shredded, chopped, ground, burned, buried, 
dumped in the ocean and exported to the Third World. They are turned into 
jogging tracks, crash barriers, jungle gyms, mud flaps, sandals, doormats and 
hockey pucks. But, despite all of this and a flurry of regulations from aroused 
statehouses, less than 4% are recycled. The rest are still accumulating in 
vermin- and mosquito-infested heaps, embarrassing environmental-protection 
authorities and inviting arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
They are banned from half of the country's landfills and being shut out of more 
every week because of their shape. They take up too much valuable space and 
trap air, causing them to resurface, as sullen and indestructible as ever. 
</P>
<P>
With the Environmental Protection Agency projecting a 50% reduction in landfill 
space by the turn of the century and 80% by the year 2010, tires appear headed 
for universal banishment from the family of ordinary garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental movement doesn't want you to put them in the ground, they 
don't want you to burn them, they don't want you to put them in the sea and, 
presumably, they don't want you to send them into space," lamented Don Wilson, 
the principal lobbyist for the National Tire Dealers and Retreaders Assn. "But 
they have to go somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Arriving home in Buffalo, N. Y., one day recently, John Spagnoli, a regional 
director of the New York State Department of Environmental Quality, looked out 
an airplane window and saw a huge truckload being dumped off the end of the 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
In the hierarchy of waste hazards, tires trail far behind nuclear and toxic 
wastes that pose direct hazards to land, air and water, but they are 
politically and physically incendiary. "Tires in themselves are not something 
that I am terribly concerned about," Spagnoli said, "but I've got tire piles 
all over the place, one with six or eight million tires, and within the next 
year or two or three, I'm going to have a fire, and the whole thing is going to 
come to a head." 
</P>
<P>
It is not an idle concern. New York had a major tire fire just last year near 
Albany. In February, environmental catastrophe was averted in Canada when 
firefighters extinguished a blaze that had burned for 17 days in an illegal 
14-million-tire dump near Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The most disastrous tire fire in history burned itself out at Winchester, Va., 
in July, 1984, but the mess it made remains. 
</P>
<P>
In nine months, the blaze consumed 5 million to 7 million tires, polluted the 
air in four states and contaminated the ground water. After state and federal 
expenditures of $4 million, the EPA still has not settled on a plan for 
cleaning up the zinc contamination of the soil and the water of a nearby lake 
and the holding pond that caught the boiling oil. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a water-treatment plant will have to be constructed on the 
site before the polluted water now being diverted into the holding pond can be 
allowed to flow into the scenic Shenandoah River. 
</P>
<P>
The list of lesser disasters, led by fires in Colorado, Wisconsin and Texas, is 
long. By some estimates, there may be 3 billion scrap automobile tires in legal 
and illegal stockpiles, with another 250 million being thrown away every year. 
Eighty-five percent of them will go into stockpiles, illegal dumps or 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Lying about, they attract not only arsonists, rats and garden-variety 
mosquitoes, but the Asian Tiger Mosquito, a known vector of dengue fever in the 
Far East and shown in the laboratory to transmit encephalitis and a number of 
less dangerous viral infections. 
</P>
<P>
Believed to have come into the United States in truck tires imported for 
recapping, the insect has now been identified in 120 counties in 17 states, and 
as far north as Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Because tire piles provide watery breeding sites for all manner of mosquitoes, 
the arrival of the Asian Tigers produced a wave of pressures to get tires into 
landfills. The United States now requires that tire casings brought in from 
Asia for recapping first must be fumigated, steam cleaned or otherwise heat 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mosquito remains of concern to public health officials, the 
national garbage crisis and the shortage of landfills has abated the rush to 
dispose of tires in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Statutes regulating disposal had been put on the books in 18 states by the end 
of last year, with an equal number expected to tackle new legislative proposals 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Several states, including California, have attached fees to tires, creating 
funds for disposal or recycling, and others have put sticker fees on new cars. 
Requirements have been laid down for stockpilers and for "casing jockeys" who 
make a buck by taking old tires off the hands of retailers. 
</P>
<P>
In Oregon, a state permit is required by anyone transporting more than 10 
tires, and heavy fines have been levied against stockpilers operating without 
permits or ignoring fire-safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Legislature -- the first such body to appropriate money for tire 
disposal -- banned dumping five years ago and mandated a vigorous effort to 
clean up existing tire piles, using chipped casings for fill in 
highway-construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
But with the problem growing worse and occasionally causing friction between 
states as junk tires cross borders, creating illegal dumps, there is now a move 
toward federal legislation making tire manufacturers and importers responsible 
for the recycling of an increasing proportion of their products. 
</P>
<P>
A recycling incentive bill introduced in the House by Rep. Esteban E. Torres 
(D-La Puente) and in the Senate by Sens. John Heinz (R-Pa.) and Timothy E. 
Wirth (D-Colo.) would require tire manufacturers and importers to recycle 5% of 
their products. The requirement, enforced by the EPA, would be increased 5% 
each year, reaching 50% by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Given governments' lack of success in handling the problem so far, the idea of 
the legislation now before Congress is to create a market for junk tires and 
jump-start a recycling industry. Tire manufacturers and importers would either 
recycle old casings themselves, putting the material back into the production 
of new tires, or purchase credits from recycling operations. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular notions, scrap tires are not worthless -- on the average, 
each one contains 2.5 gallons of oil -- and neither is there any dearth of 
ideas for things to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that there are so many tires -- steel reinforced to survive age, 
potholes, high speeds, quick stops, heat, cold, low shoulders and hard curbs. 
</P>
<P>
But technology has kept apace. New machines will slice through steel belts like 
liverwurst, turning rubber into the consistency of crumbs, sand or baby powder. 
</P>
<P>
For years, California and a growing list of other states have been 
experimenting with crumb rubber for road paving and patching, and advocates of 
the practice maintain that rubber asphalt mixes will outlast conventional 
asphalt and perhaps provide better traction. Paving a mile with a rubber 
asphalt mix can use the equivalent of 16,000 junk tires. 
</P>
<P>
Appealing as it sounds, the recycling of old tires into new roads has been a 
long time coming because the mix is more expensive than ordinary asphalt, 
because patent issues are involved, and because the Federal Highway 
Administration is still at work on standards that specify ratios and 
performance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The story is similar across the recycling front. 
</P>
<P>
Retreading has been thrown into steady decline with the arrival of inexpensive 
new tires from the Far East, making new tires less expensive than retreads. 
Although shops across the country have the capacity to put new treads on as 
many as 25 million tires a year, only an estimated 12.5 million passenger-car 
tires were retreaded last year. In the mid '80s, 12% of the more than 200 
million auto tires were being retreaded. By last year, the number had declined 
to 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the technology to retread or reincarnate bald and near-bald casings 
into anything from dish drains to carbon black, it is more profitable to ship 
worn tires to Third World countries for continued service than it is to recycle 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But the feeble waste-tire market has never discouraged eccentrics and dreamers, 
who have accumulated mountains of them with an eye to the day when sky-high 
energy prices would make them rich. 
</P>
<P>
One such collector may have altered the course of the waste-tire crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Over a period of 20 years, Ed Filben collected the biggest pile of junk tires 
in the history of the world, 30 million to 40 million of them filling a whole 
valley in the hills outside of Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
On a slope above the stupefying dump, Oxford Energy Inc., a New York-based 
company, is burning tires from Filben's collection in a $41-million high-tech 
plant. The Oxford plant, which obtained the tires in a lease arrangement with 
Filben, generates 14 megawatts of electricity, sufficient to supply the needs 
of 15,000 homes. The electricity is sold to PG&amp;E, the local utility. 
</P>
<P>
With its 2,000-degree incinerator going 24 hours a day and consuming 4 million 
tires a year, the pile could disappear by about the turn of the century. But 
meanwhile, the company is collecting more tires -- those of more recent vintage 
produce more energy -- and expects to continue burning after the massive Filben 
collection is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups, long alarmed over the presence of the outrageous dump, 
have opposed the import of any more tires, but the plant has complied with 
state air quality requirements and received environmental citations from the 
state and the U.S. Department of Energy. Moving into the black after losing 
money for half of its first two years, it is being shown off to visitors from 
other towns where the Oxford company wants to start up new operations. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started, we were thinking in terms of 20 or 40 plants around the 
country," said Oxford Vice President Robert Graulich, "but we have decided that 
is neither possible nor desirable." 
</P>
<P>
The success at Modesto has not made expansion easy. If abandoned tires 
epitomize decay, the notion of tire burning conjures the smell of rubber and 
the image of oily black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
When Oxford proposed to collect millions of tires from across New England and 
burn them in a tire-to-electricity plant at Stirling, Conn., it created an 
uproar across the nearby border in Rhode Island. Concerned that the operation 
would foul the state's largest water reservoir, the Rhode Island Legislature 
adopted a bill to block tires from being shipped out of the state to an 
incinerating facility within 200 miles of its state line. 
</P>
<P>
But after four years, construction is beginning. Oxford is collecting and 
chipping tires from across New England. According to Graulich, it expects to be 
collecting them at a rate of 11 million a year by the time it goes into 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Oxford has set its sights on Lackawanna, N. Y., an old Lake Erie 
steel town, for a third plant, provoking a debate that stands to become a 
metaphor for the national waste-disposal crisis and the struggle against tire 
piles. 
</P>
<P>
Lackawanna is financially strapped, devastated by the shutdown of the venerable 
Bethlehem Steel Co. plant. A monumental cleanup task remains at the abandoned 
site, while Bethlehem's only remaining operation, a coke oven, continues to 
regularly belch pollution, bringing it fines from the state Department of 
Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
It is the epitome of a Rust Belt town trying to make a transition to a new 
economy. It desperately needs new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Oxford Energy's proposal to locate a tire-fed electric power plant twice the 
size of the Modesto facility produced a sharp split in the town, although the 
operation would pay it $980,000 to start up and about $550,000 per year in lieu 
of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that Lackawanna is in an area of the state that has excess 
landfill, two hazardous waste facilities and a nuclear waste dump. Before 
Oxford approached with its proposal for a tire-burning plant, the giant waste 
disposal firm Browning-Ferris Industries made Lackawanna its choice as a 
location for a huge medical waste processing operation. 
</P>
<P>
"The aura of waste has overpowered rational discussion," said Spagnoli, the 
state environmental official whose region includes Lackawanna. "There is a 
garbage phobia because there isn't a hazardous waste made that we don't handle 
in western New York." 
</P>
<P>
At Oxford, Graulich professes not to be surprised that "we got swept up in all 
the unfounded fears. We knew that what we were doing was unusual and that we 
would always have to go through a protracted public education process." 
</P>
<P>
Other communities have already been presented with the issues now facing 
Lackawanna. 
</P>
<P>
When a Utah-based company proposed to build a plant to generate electricity 
from shredded tires at Rialto near San Bernardino, a complex legal battle 
ensued, involving several counties and municipalities and pitting the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District against its own appeals board. The fight 
has gone on for more than five years with two trials and two trips to an appeal 
court, and the opposition thus far prevailing. 
</P>
<P>
Another company, Resource Technology Inc., has hopes of turning old tires into 
profit at a prototype tire-burning plant at Claxton, Ga. Rather than generating 
electricity, the plan in Florida is to make a profit by recovering oil, zinc 
and carbon black, among other byproducts. The firm plans to apply for a permit 
for a full-scale facility in Polk County, Fla., where there is a tire pile 
estimated at 10 million, one of a half-dozen in the state with 5 million 
casings or more. 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, in the tire business, and among environmental groups there remain 
doubts that incineration or current recycling is the answer to the tire 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
There is a notion that there is something to be learned from the junk dealers 
who have created the eyesores and fire hazards with their massive collections. 
</P>
<P>
Shredded tires, it is suggested, might be put into lined landfills, and covered 
with another liner beneath a layer of dirt. Immune to decomposition, they would 
remain an energy bank against the day when oil prices might make it 
commercially attractive to recover them.

For all the anxiety of the last few months, Alice Gordezky's daughter might as 
well have applied to an Ivy League college. 
</P>
<P>
There were enigmatic tests, endless interviews and probing essay questions. 
Tuition could have bought a new car. And the odds of getting in, well, they 
made Yale look like a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
When the letter -- a thick one, indicating acceptance -- arrived in last 
Saturday's mail, Gordezky screamed with joy. Five-year-old Rachel had won a 
spot in an exclusive North Hollywood kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole experience was amazingly stressful . . . ludicrous . . . and 
mind-boggling," said Gordezky, 37, a graphic artist from Van Nuys. "I guess I 
was one of the lucky ones." 
</P>

Welcome to the world of private education in Los Angeles. But don't expect to 
get in. Dissatisfaction with conditions at public schools and the specter of 
year-round classes have unleashed a stampede of youngsters that few private 
schools can accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, dozens of elite schools across the county -- from Carlthorpe in 
Santa Monica to Buckley in Sherman Oaks to John Thomas Dye in Bel-Air -- mailed 
out acceptance and rejection letters for next fall, then promptly closed for a 
two-week vacation. Of the thousands of children who applied, somewhere between 
75% to 95% were wished better luck next time. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to cry," said an Encino mother, who asked not to be identified 
because her 5-year-old son is still on a waiting list at one school. "This was 
really the first rejection of his young life." 
</P>
<P>
Although this process has been a spring rite for years at private schools, 
administrators say the crunch to get into classes this fall -- even at prices 
that range from $5,000 to $8,000 a year -- has never been more intense. 
</P>
<P>
At Polytechnic School in Pasadena, for instance, no new students were accepted 
for the second, third and fifth grades, despite more than 40 applications for 
each class. The competition is just as fierce at the high school level. At 
Oakwood School in North Hollywood, applications for some classes increased by 
as much as 250% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a painful time of year," said Mimi Baer, executive director of the 
California Assn. of Independent Schools, which represents 50 private schools in 
the Los Angeles area serving about 60,000 students. The organization only 
admits schools that have been in existence at least six years and have 
independent boards of directors, which excludes most religious schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us really deplore the situation," she said. "We're having to 
say 'no' to a lot of wonderful families." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many Eastern schools, however, where successive generations of 
youngsters often attend their family's alma mater, headmasters at private 
schools here say they are attracting mostly first-time students. 
</P>
<P>
They come from families who believe fervently in public education -- who, in 
fact, say they would prefer that their children attend a neighborhood school -- 
but feel that deteriorating conditions there have left them no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"Many come with a sense of resignation and, in some cases, desperation," said 
Paul Cummins, headmaster of Crossroads School in Santa Monica. "They really 
wish their neighborhood schools were doing the job. But we, as a society, have 
dumped so many problems on the public schools . . . that these families just 
give up." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the desperation of parents more magnified than at the kindergarten 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Because most students don't leave once they are accepted, kindergarten is 
usually the only realistic shot a family has at getting into the private school 
of its choice. That is, if 175 children vying for 10 spots seems realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Families come to me in a total panic," said Harriett Bay, a West Los Angeles 
consultant, who at $600 a pop, does a thriving business helping match children 
with private schools. "I work with them and really try to calm them down . . . 
but I can't guarantee placement." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there's no such thing as a sure thing, given that admissions directors 
are trying to assess the academic potential of kids only a few years removed 
from diapers. Besides, their methods for separating the cream of 4-year-olds 
from the rest of the crop vary wildly. 
</P>
<P>
At Mirman School for Gifted Children in Bel-Air, pupils must possess an IQ of 
at least 145 -- well above average and bordering on genius -- just to be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
Most other schools try to judge development and verbal skills by having a 
teacher tell a story, then asking the child to recall the sequence of events. 
Many rely heavily on nursery school evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
Some refuse to meet the children one-on-one, but spend considerable time 
interviewing the parents. And a few engage the youngsters in social activities, 
such as sharing graham crackers and milk, to see how well they interact with 
their peers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's utterly crazy," said Aliza Guren, 35, of Brentwood, whose 4-year-old son 
will begin kindergarten at a private school this fall. Guren, a graduate of 
Harvard Law School, helps the university interview prospective students. 
</P>
<P>
"At least there you have scores, boards, grades and records," she said. "But 
what does a 4-year-old have? These are little kids." 
</P>
<P>
Many parents take a more cynical approach. They prep their children for the 
interviews and train them for the tests. Some families have found that hefty 
financial contributions, apart from tuition, increase their chances. Others say 
it's not who your child is, but who you know. 
</P>
<P>
"There was so much politics going on, your name, your income, your position, 
your connections," said one Santa Monica woman, a former actress, whose 
4-year-old daughter is on a waiting list. "I tried to be realistic, because I 
felt like we were just kind of mid-range on all those points." 
</P>
<P>
Even administrators concede the process is imperfect. 
</P>
<P>
"The report on my own daughter when she was 4 was that her hand-eye 
coordination wasn't too good, as reflected by her use of the scissors," said 
Cummins, the Crossroads headmaster. "Now, she's a violinist." 
</P>
<P>
But faced with a staggering number of applications and committed to maintaining 
small classes, most private schools say they know of no other way to make their 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are they laughing all the way to the bank. Administrators say they are 
pleased to find parents interested in their schools, but they are distressed 
that the quality of education in public districts has sent so many desperate 
families their way. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these are really nice people looking at their little guy or girl and 
wondering what's the best they can do for them," said Mike Babcock, 
Polytechnic's headmaster. "We do our best to explain that it's a bit of a crap 
shoot. But there's no question that this is a time of anxiety and I really 
regret it. When your child is 3 or 4 or 5, you shouldn't have to worry about 
their schooling." 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, about 4,000 of the district's 
610,000 students left to attend private schools last year. To some extent, 
officials concede, it is a welcome relief from overcrowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul Possemato, associate superintendent for instruction, says he fears 
that some parents may be leaving the district for the wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This society is a complex and varied one. It is diverse and dynamic," 
Possemato said. "Because of that, a child must learn to grow and mature in an 
environment that's real. Public schools are where reality exists. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice to parents is always the same," he said. "Don't run from public 
education because you think you're going to save your child. You're just going 
to force your child to run from real-life issues." 
</P>
<P>
For many parents, however, that philosophy is far from realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line for every parent is you have to do what is best for your 
children," said Abbie Rich, a PTA mom in Tarzana, whose son, 10, and daughter, 
6, will enter a private school in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Her litany of complaints about the public school system is familiar: 
overcrowding, lack of resources, discipline problems in class, too few teachers 
capable of helping non-English-speaking students and eventual year-round 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rich said she worked hard at her local elementary school, serving as a 
Spanish-speaking classroom volunteer and helping to raise money for computers 
and books, she began to see the problems as bigger than what a few concerned 
parents could accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"Private school should be an option," said Rich, 41, a free-lance television 
writer. "It shouldn't have to be a necessity. That's what's absurd."

ON CALIFORNIA: DEATH ROW DRAMA KEEPS DRAGGING ON

SAN QUENTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it's nostalgia, but they don't seem to make stays of execution like they 
used to. Back in the days when John Garfield was Hollywood's favorite Death Row 
prisoner, a last-minute stay was always a matter of some intimacy. The warden 
got the call, and he delivered the good news personally to Garfield, who 
gripped the bars of his cell and looked upward. 
</P>
<P>
The stay made Garfield's mom happy, it made the wife happy. Otherwise, the 
outside world went about its business, getting and spending, more or less 
ignoring the small drama on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the stay of Robert Alton Harris' execution was a different matter. 
Nothing about Harris' upcoming demise has been ignored. This weekend was 
scheduled as a sort of public extravaganza preceding his death Tuesday, full of 
marches across the Golden Gate Bridge and fasting vigils outside San Quentin's 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
It was said that the pro-death-penalty forces were assembling in Marin County, 
where San Quentin sits nestled by the bay. They would do battle with the antis, 
and the threat of resulting traffic jams had persuaded the California Highway 
Patrol to announce that vehicle flow across the bridge would be protected at 
all costs. The hour of execution was changed from 10 a.m. to 3 a.m. to ensure a 
normal commute on Harris' last day. 
</P>
<P>
In short, everyone had their plan. This included the large newspapers and 
television stations of California, which had staked out Harris' every relative, 
his victims' relatives, his old prosecutors, his schoolteachers. The whole 
state was wired for comment on Harris' last hours. Dozens of stories had been 
written in advance and set in type, waiting for weekend release. 
</P>
<P>
So when the stay was announced by U.S Appellate Judge John T. Noonan, there was 
a reaction here that was uniquely modern. First there was joy or anger, 
depending on one's point of view. And then something else, a kind of 
disappointment. The extravaganza might not, after all, go on as scheduled. A 
major piece of show business had just gone down the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of this disappointment, some showed defiance. The organizers of the 
anti-death penalty march across the Golden Gate Bridge decided to march anyway. 
And outside San Quentin's gates, a group keeping vigil said they would continue 
to fast. It was as if, for these people, the momentum could not be turned off. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a dutiful de-coupling began. Inside newspapers, editors were 
furiously tearing apart Harris layouts. Television stations were breaking the 
linkups to the homes of victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
And everywhere there was the sense of surprise. Legally, Harris had been 
considered a done deal. Hadn't there been 11 years of appeals? Hadn't he tried 
everything, and weren't his lawyers grasping at the well-known straws? Wasn't 
the state attorney general holding a briefing every day, showing a flowchart 
that documented Harris' sure march toward death? 
</P>
<P>
It was as if, in the heady momentum, everyone had forgotten about this 
country's deep ambivalence toward the act of official killing. Had forgotten 
that there is a reason why it takes years and sometimes decades to put a person 
in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
John T. Noonan stopped the extravaganza by reminding California that the 
ambivalence is alive and well. He was not impressed by arguments that 11 years 
of previous appeals were enough, or by the attorney general's flowcharts. He 
was impressed by certain rights granted the accused by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
He began by pointing out some language in a lower court ruling that had 
referred to Harris' "alleged" right to have psychiatric experts on his side 
during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Alleged?" Noonan asked. When the Supreme Court rules that every defendant has 
the right to a psychiatric expert, it no longer falls in the "alleged" 
category, he said. It is simply a right. 
</P>
<P>
So Noonan granted the stay and shattered the illusion that Harris was a done 
deal. As we proceed into California's new era of executions, it may be a lesson 
worth remembering. As one after another of the 271 people on Death Row arrive 
at their time, there are going to be very few cases without this kind of agony. 
</P>
<P>
The condemned are going to be left waiting and wondering when, or if, they will 
die as their cases twist and turn in the courts. Families of victims will be 
enraged when the promise of revenge is denied. This is the true horror of the 
death penalty and maybe it's fortunate that Noonan showed us what it looks 
like. 
</P>
<P>
Just in case any of us were looking forward to the next extravaganza.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS RYAN DRUG USE 'NOT RELEVANT'; 
</P>
<P>
NOMINEE: YOUTHFUL EXPERIMENTS BY THE BABY BOOM GENERATION SHOULD BE FORGIVEN, 
OFFICIALS INSIST. THEY URGE CONFIRMATION OF THRIFT REGULATOR.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration and other supporters of T. Timothy Ryan Jr., nominated 
as the nation's chief thrift regulator despite past marijuana and cocaine use, 
argued Saturday that baby boomers should be forgiven their youthful dabbling in 
drugs as they move into key jobs in government and business. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said it knew that Ryan had smoked marijuana occasionally and 
tried cocaine once or twice in the early 1970s, but it did not consider the 
disclosures "relevant" to consideration of his nomination, spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Administration does not consider past experimentation with 
drugs as a political kiss of death because it was a shared experience among 
millions of young Americans during a more permissive era. 
</P>
<P>
The youth of the 1960s and 1970s, many of whom experimented with marijuana and 
other drugs, are now old enough to begin filling an increasing share of the 
nation's most important and influential jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Timothy Ryan's generation of Americans is now emerging into top leadership 
positions in both government and the private sector," said Sen. John W. Warner 
(R-Va.), a political and personal friend of Ryan for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be bad policy to reject, across the board, those who in their college 
or graduate years, on one or two occasions, experimented with controlled 
substances and then -- as Mr. Ryan has assured me and the Administration -- 
never used them again." 
</P>
<P>
White House and Treasury officials were making phone calls on Ryan's behalf 
Saturday, explaining to senators who will vote on Ryan's confirmation that they 
knew about Ryan's drug use before they sent his name to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew about it beforehand," Fitzwater said Saturday. "We felt it was not 
relevant. We felt he was the best candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who picked the 44-year-old Ryan to 
regulate the ailing savings and loan industry, called several senators to 
emphasize that the Administration is sticking with its nominee. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House and the secretary are 100% behind" Ryan, said Treasury 
spokeswoman Desiree Tucker-Sorini. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan first acknowledged past drug use when he filled out a questionnaire for 
the FBI as part of the standard clearance process for seeking the government 
post as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. One question asks about 
any use of illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
After filling out the questionnaire, Ryan told FBI agents in personal 
interviews that he had used marijuana occasionally while attending law school, 
sources said Saturday. He also said he had used cocaine at least once, and 
possibly twice. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said his last use of drugs may have been during the summer before he took 
the bar examination, the sources indicated. 
</P>
<P>
After his disclosures to the FBI, Ryan notified Brady and White House officials 
about his past drug use. They told him it would not alter their support for his 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"These things happened a long time ago when a lot of people were experimenting 
with drugs," one Administration official said. "This kind of thing should not 
be held against him now." 
</P>
<P>
The information contained in FBI reports was made available to members of the 
Senate Banking Committee, which approved his nomination by an 11-to-10 vote 
Friday. The full Senate will vote on the nomination Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Several committee members leaked the news of the drug disclosures late Friday, 
but the Administration remained undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, which has mounted a concerted war on narcotics, contends 
that any use of illegal drugs is morally reprehensible and cannot be condoned. 
</P>
<P>
But officials acknowledged that the social and political climate was different 
in the 1960s and 1970s, when drug use often was regarded as acceptable among 
many college students and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Each individual must be fairly examined," Warner said. "When these early 
mistakes in life are disclosed up front and honestly, that person should be 
given the opportunity today to compete for and accept positions of major 
responsibility in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, President Bush stated: "In my view, if somebody used marijuana some 
time ago and is not into anything of that nature, why, no, I don't think that 
should be used against them." 
</P>
<P>
He made the comment in response to questions about Texas State Treasurer Ann 
Richards, a Democratic candidate for governor who refused to say whether she 
had used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush told reporters he had never 
experimented with illegal drugs. "But I'd hate to speak for my kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is anxious to win Ryan's confirmation by the Senate because 
of legal uncertainties surrounding the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge blocked the impending seizure of an Illinois savings and loan, 
ruling that the agency could not act because former OTS director M. Danny Wall 
was never confirmed by the Senate. An appeals court will hear arguments on the 
issue April 11. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's formal confirmation would remove any ambiguities about the government's 
legal authority to carry out regulation of the trillion-dollar industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan served as solicitor of the Labor Department from 1981 to 1983.

NASA ADVANCES LAUNCH DATE FOR SHUTTLE AND SPACE TELESCOPE

<TEXT>
<P>
NASA, in a rare move, advanced the launch date Saturday for the shuttle 
Discovery and its prestigious payload, the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery now is due to lift off April 10, two days earlier than originally 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
"The shuttle team is ready to fly. Hubble is one of the most exciting payloads 
ever launched aboard the shuttle, and we're looking forward to the mission," 
said William Lenoir, associate administrator for space flight for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The space agency's Flight Readiness Review Board decided to move up the mission 
after meeting for two days at Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
NASA said last week that technicians needed little of the contingency time 
built into Discovery's prelaunch schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Once deployed by Discovery's astronauts, the Hubble will orbit 380 miles above 
Earth for 15 years. The telescope will be capable of looking seven times more 
deeply into space with greater clarity and detecting objects 50 times fainter 
than the best ground-based observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers expect to use it to study stars and galaxies so distant that their 
light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years. 
</P>
<P>
NASA occasionally has shifted shuttle launch dates because of scheduling 
changes in the months prior to liftoff. But it is the first time liftoff has 
been accelerated during orbiter processing. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Discovery's launch date was changed from April 18 to April 12 
after the lower right segment of the shuttle's solid rocket booster was 
replaced more quickly than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians planned to test the telescope's systems and scientific instruments 
today. They want to ensure remote communications with the Space Telescope 
Operations Control Center at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, 
Md., and other facilities.

RIOTING ERUPTS OVER BRITISH POLL TAX; 
</P>
<P>
PROTEST: 'MARXIST AGITATORS AND MILITANTS' ARE BLAMED FOR VIOLENT STREET 
BATTLES. POLICE ARREST 340 PEOPLE, AND MORE THAN 130 ARE HURT.

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A huge demonstration against a highly unpopular new tax scheme turned into one 
of the worst riots to ravage central London in memory Saturday as militants 
torched cars, smashed windows, looted stores and attacked police in more than 
six hours of almost nonstop violence. 
</P>
<P>
At least 340 people were arrested and more than 130 were injured, including at 
least 58 police officers, as some of this city's most famous landmarks became 
the focus of running battles that left streets and sidewalks littered with 
broken glass, shattered paving stones and upended trash containers. 
</P>
<P>
The violence moved from the front of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
official residence at No. 10 Downing St. through Whitehall and Trafalgar Square 
to the West End theater district, where one show was canceled and the audience 
at another was locked in to protect it from the riot outside. 
</P>
<P>
At least two buildings were set ablaze, including the South African Embassy, 
and authorities closed subway stations in the area of Leicester Square, an 
entertainment mecca that is normally considered London's busiest district on a 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a well-organized demonstration, but these lunatics, anarchists and 
other extremists, principally from the Socialist Workers' Party, were out for a 
rumble the whole time," said a distressed George Galloway, a member of 
Parliament from the opposition Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
"If they didn't exist, the Tories would need to invent them," he added, 
referring to the discredit the militants brought to the campaign against the 
controversial tax scheme devised by Thatcher's ruling Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
The new community service charge, or poll tax, as it is more popularly known, 
replaces the old system of property taxes to pay for local government services 
with a flat levy on everyone over age 18. 
</P>
<P>
The new tax goes into effect today in England and Wales. It is seen as a key 
factor behind a precipitous drop in popularity that has left the Conservatives 
trailing Labor badly in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, who was in the resort town of Cheltenham on Saturday to address a 
meeting of her party's activists, defended the poll tax and blamed the violent 
demonstrations on "Marxist agitators and militants." 
</P>
<P>
There was also trouble in Cheltenham after Thatcher spoke, when protesters 
pelted police outside the hall with rocks and other debris. Two police officers 
were reported hurt, and 48 people were arrested there. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a peaceful anti-poll tax demonstration involving a reported 
25,000 people Saturday in Glasgow. The controversial levy has already been in 
force for a year in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner David Meynell told reporters that the 
London demonstration also began as a responsible and peaceful march of more 
than 40,000 people on a warm, sunny day. But their actions were soon 
"completely overshadowed" by as many as 3,000 hooligans whom police described 
as "fairly hard-core, violent people," many of whom had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began about 3 p.m., when police tried to prevent a breakaway group 
of demonstrators from carrying their protest down Whitehall toward Thatcher's 
official residence. 
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses asserted that overzealous police crowd-control tactics triggered 
the violence. But others, including some of the demonstration's organizers, 
said that a "minority of extremists" appeared determined to cause trouble from 
the beginning.

SIMPLE SIGN POINTS TO MASS TRAUMA; 
</P>
<P>
EAST GERMANY: NEW SITE OF GRAVES IS A TESTAMENT TO HISTORY AS A LIE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A simple blue sign unveiled the truth at last: "Mass graves of unknown 
victims," it read. "Do not walk here." 
</P>
<P>
The sign, tacked to a spindly tree in the forest of pines and birch just west 
of this sleepy village, marked the place where victorious Soviet forces 
executed hundreds of Germans in the months after the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of human remains was the latest in a series of traumas that 
freedom has brought the East Germans, a people already unnerved by realization 
that much of their history has been a lie. 
</P>
<P>
Every child of East Germany has learned of fascist and Nazi atrocities, but 
only of Soviet good deeds and friendship. 
</P>
<P>
After years of silence and weeks of unsettling rumors, East German soldiers 
arrived here Friday with shovels and electronic equipment to prove yet another 
official lie. Three hours was enough to confirm the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"We know 100% there are mass graves there," said Heinz Erdmann, deputy chairman 
of the local district government in the nearby town of Oranienburg. "We now 
want to leave the dead in peace and erected a memorial." 
</P>
<P>
Erdmann said that evidence from the site, along with preliminary official 
research and statements from four witnesses who have come forward in recent 
days, led him to conclude the victims were mainly German, possibly former petty 
Nazi functionaries denounced by locals, or young people found with weapons in 
the chaos of Germany's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made no (exact) estimate, but we feel there are many hundreds here," 
Erdmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were almost certainly prisoners from the nearby Sachsenhausen Nazi 
concentration camp, one of 11 locations the Soviets used to intern Germans 
during the first postwar years. 
</P>
<P>
According to a variety of Western official estimates, nearly a quarter of a 
million people, mainly German men, were interned by the Soviets between 1945 
and 1950. 
</P>
<P>
They are believed to include socialists who resisted the fusion of the 
political left into a single Communist Party that eventually ruled East Germany 
for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere between 10,000 and 80,000 of those interned are believed to have 
starved, frozen to death, died of disease or been shot. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans first learned of Soviet atrocities last weekend, when East Berlin 
newspapers published reports of mass graves on the outskirts of Neubrandenburg, 
a city about 80 miles north of Berlin. Since then, two other sites, including 
Schmachtenhagen, have been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Germans were interned following the war was certainly no secret. 
</P>
<P>
The victorious Allied powers agreed at the 1945 Potsdam Conference on the right 
to detain suspected Nazis or others described as "potentially dangerous 
Germans." 
</P>
<P>
However, 40 years of unyielding Communist rule in East Germany suppressed the 
truth of what happened in those Soviet camps. 
</P>
<P>
"All anyone wanted to know about was German-Soviet friendship, and what 
happened here didn't fit that," said Kurt Mueller, a 61-year-old electrician 
here. "Finally the truth is out." It was Mueller who persuaded the authorities 
to search for the graves. 
</P>
<P>
His story and that of this small village of a few hundred families are itself 
human dramas, dramas of people trapped with their secret and the reality of a 
Communist dictatorship willing to crush those who disputed its truth. 
</P>
<P>
After living seven years in the shadow of the Sachsenhausen death camp during 
Hitler's Third Reich, the people of Schmachtenhagen had learned that silence 
was the safest course. 
</P>
<P>
Even the initial lonely, questioning voices of those such as Mueller faded with 
time. The village pretended to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born here, my parents were born here, I wanted to live in this village," 
he said during an interview in his small living room. "I didn't want to have to 
leave because I kept on about this." 
</P>
<P>
He said he finally fell silent in the late 1950s when a schoolteacher took him 
aside one day and told him his children's future would be jeopardized if he 
persisted. 
</P>
<P>
Sascha Riek, a 15-year-old village youth, said even his favorite teacher, Frau 
Ferber, who told him lots of things she shouldn't have, never mentioned the 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller, whose house backs onto the forest, said he was 17 when he returned 
home after the war in August, 1945, and a friend first showed him the grave. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed me a grave, about 3 meters (just under 10 feet) by 2 meters (just 
over 6 feet)," Mueller said. "I saw an elbow sticking out. 
</P>
<P>
"We went away, we believed there was nothing we could do. We were afraid. The 
war had led to so much hate." 
</P>
<P>
The fear was so great that Erdmann described the four witnesses to the 
shootings who have so far come forward as "earwitnesses," rather than 
eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They heard trucks, they heard shooting, but it wasn't a time when such sounds 
made you want to go closer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only with the collapse of Erich Honecker's neo-Stalinist regime late last year 
did Mueller carefully start again. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, nearly 50 East German army soldiers, working as volunteers from a 
nearby base, unearthed enough human remains to confirm what most older people 
here had been unable to forget.

DOCTOR STOPS LABOR AFTER 1ST TWIN IS BORN; 2ND NOT DUE FOR 15 WEEKS

In one of only 14 recorded cases of its kind, a woman gave premature birth to a 
girl 15 weeks before the infant's twin sister is due, hospital officials 
announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Krasenics, 24, gave birth to 1-pound, 8-ounce Shakoora Krasenics on 
Thursday at Crawford-Long Hospital of Emory University, said Tisha Burland, a 
hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister's full-term arrival is expected in July. 
</P>
<P>
After Shakoora's birth, Dr. Camille Davis-Williams was able to stop further 
labor, preventing the other twin from being born prematurely, Burland said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams tried to terminate labor before Shakoora was born, but the baby's 
water sac broke and she had to be delivered. The other twin's water remained 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
Shakoora was placed in an incubator in the nursery's intensive care unit and 
was reported in critical but stable condition Saturday. Donna Krasenics was 
listed in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
Burland said the baby was in good hands. "We've taken care of much lighter 
babies and much sicker babies in this intensive care unit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Krasenics will have to stay in bed until her second baby is born. Shakoora will 
remain at the hospital until she gains enough weight to be out of danger, 
Burland said.

BODIES OF 50 CLUB FIRE VICTIMS SENT HOME

The bodies of 50 of the 87 people killed in a Bronx social club fire were 
loaded onto a cargo plane at Kennedy Airport on Saturday for a late-night 
flight to Honduras, a nation in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
At a brief memorial service in the hangar to which the coffins had come, some 
in hearses, others stacked on flatbed trucks, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said New 
York would "do all possible to make sure this will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
"These young people came to this great city of ours seeking hope and 
opportunity, and now they leave like this," Lynch said, gesturing toward the 
long row of coffins. "The bodies lying here before us say we've got to do more. 
We've got to do more to make sure this doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, police were continuing their crackdown on the hundreds of 
unlicensed social clubs that dot the city's poorer neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they visited 261 locations late Friday and early Saturday and found 
only 65 clubs open. They issued 29 orders to vacate the premises, 57 summonses 
and 80 violation notices. 
</P>
<P>
Most club operators closed down before they were shut down, according to a 
neighborhood store owner who has supplied liquor to social clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer said that by Friday afternoon he had not heard from any of the 
clubs that normally contact him to place orders. 
</P>
<P>
Because they are not licensed, social clubs cannot obtain liquor from 
wholesalers and must buy from retailers. 
</P>
<P>
A Bronx grand jury has indicted Julio Gonzalez with murder for allegedly 
setting the fire that devastated the Happy Land social club a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The DC-8 scheduled to take the 50 bodies to Honduras was chartered by the 
American Red Cross. A spokesman said about 100 relatives of fire victims were 
being flown to Honduras at Red Cross expense on commercial flights.

Most Southern Californians won't be able to see the new HA! comedy channel when 
it begins today. Symptomatic of the difficulty that new cable ventures face 
getting off the ground these days, only one cable system in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties is carrying the service: Century Cable -- and only in the areas 
of West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Paragon Cable, which serves Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Westminster, 
Fountain Valley, Stanton, Rossmoor, Los Alamitos, Midway City and parts of 
Anaheim, has signed up to carry HA! but it won't start for a month or two, and 
will only be available initially for 12 hours a day, sharing channel space with 
another, as-yet-undecided programming service. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the major cable systems in San Diego has picked up HA! yet either.

CNN: FAR FROM BROKEN, BUT THEY'RE FIXING IT; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERING ITS SECOND DECADE, CABLE NEWS NETWORK IS MAKING CHANGES -- AND DRAWING 
CRITICISM -- IN A BID FOR RATINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
It is a busy day in the global village. George Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev and 
South African President F.W. de Klerk are all making front-page news. West 
Virginia is under a court order to close an overcrowded prison, the Toronto 
city council is considering a measure to curb the greenhouse effect and Japan 
is introducing a new bullet train. 
</P>
<P>
Around a large conference table in the Atlanta headquarters of Cable News 
Network, the senior executives and producers of CNN gather at 8 a.m. to 
determine the run-down of stories and the deployment of troops -- which stories 
should be covered live, which ones will be reported and shot by CNN's own 
correspondents and crews, and which will include video footage from 
international news services. 
</P>
<P>
Since CNN, as advertised, is a 24-hour news channel with newscasts throughout 
the day, the pressure is to get the stories on the air as soon as possible, 
with updates for several newscasts through the day. "The broadcast networks 
focus their resources on their half-hour evening newscasts," Ed Turner, the CNN 
executive in charge of news-gathering, will say later in an interview. "Our 
charter is to get it in and get it on. Get it right, but get it on." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at the same time, there's another pull at CNN these days. Although 
producer Bob Furnad wants to know why a Washington reporter can't "turn a quick 
spot preview" of an upcoming speech by noon, he says of a feature on an 
endangered species, "Can we run it at 2? Don't ruin it." 
</P>
<P>
"That's promotable," Turner says of a piece about an inventor who is 
successfully suing big auto companies. 
</P>
<P>
The word promotable -- meaning an upcoming story that can be teased to keep 
zap-happy viewers tuned in -- may never replace the word now at CNN. But as 
Cable News Network approaches its 10th anniversary in June, it is facing 
something of an identity crisis. Even as it grows, CNN is grappling with its 
vision of the future. 
</P>
<P>
CNN has made its reputation with its round-the-clock, no-frills format and 
extended live coverage, from the revolution in China to the stock-market crash 
on Wall Street. In pointed contrast to the broadcast networks, CNN has prided 
itself on making the news -- not the anchor -- the star. But despite recent 
gains, CNN's Nielsen ratings have hit a plateau, averaging a 0.7 in the 
Nielsens over the course of a day in February (meaning that about 645,000 
households are tuned in at any given time). Although the company is not under 
broadcast-style ratings pressure, having generated operating profits of $134 
million in 1989, CNN executives are thinking about ways to bring in more 
regular viewers -- and to provide the kind of in-depth analysis that its 
critics say it needs to grow beyond being a video wire service. 
</P>
<P>
Does that translate into the high-profile investigative team that made its 
on-air debut last week? Will there be more "network"-style anchors like 
Catherine Crier, a former Texas judge who was hired last fall to co-anchor a 
CNN newscast without any experience in journalism? Says one CNN producer, 
"We're at a crossroads." 
</P>
<P>
Once derided as the "Chicken Noodle Network" by broadcast-TV executives, CNN 
has upped the ante in broadcast news, forcing ABC, CBS and NBC to increase 
their live news coverage and regularly fly their anchors around the world to 
the scenes of big stories. So entrenched is the upstart that CBS executives 
recently went to Atlanta to court CNN founder Ted Turner, their old nemesis, 
about possibly sharing some news-gathering facilities. Now seen in 90 countries 
around the world, CNN has become such a force in video-geopolitics that 
President Bush is reported to have watched CNN to see how the invasion of 
Panama was going, and a recent CNN report that Gorbachev was considering 
resigning his position as chief of the Communist party immediately affected 
financial markets around the world. CNN won the prestigious Du Pont Award for 
its live coverage of the turmoil in China last year, which was anchored by 
Bernard Shaw and included dramatic on-camera negotiations with Chinese 
authorities trying to pull the plug on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN has become an international habit . . . for catching fast-breaking news," 
says Ben Bagdikian, a professor at the graduate journalism school of UC 
Berkeley. Comparing CNN to a video wire service, Bagdikian says, "They operate 
around the clock and around the world, offering straight accounts of events 
without necessarily having it in depth, the way the networks try to achieve. 
The broadcast networks have countered by offering the big story in depth. But 
with their own cutbacks, the network are caught between the devil and the deep 
blue sea." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we've established ourselves as the network where people know they 
can tune in when something happens, knowing we'll be there to stay with the 
story," Ed Turner says. "News is our only story, and we don't have to break 
into 'Major Dad' to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a major news event has an immediate impact on CNN's ratings. The Bay 
Area earthquake last October gave CNN its highest average audience: The day 
after the temblor, an average of 1,273,000 households watched CNN throughout 
the day. The ratings were only slightly smaller the day after the U.S. invasion 
of Panama last January. The highest ratings for one 15-minute period were 
registered during the rescue of Jessica McClure from a Texas well in October, 
1987, when 3.1 million households were tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
Events in China and Berlin produced slightly higher numbers than normal but not 
nearly the same as Panama and the earthquake. "We had great stuff from China, 
and sometimes the very crudeness of it made it great," says Furnad, vice 
president and senior producer at CNN. "But the ratings jumped and then fell 
off. It's sad, but maybe that's because American lives were not at stake." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Furnad said, issues such as abortion and animal-rights are 
emotional "spikes" that excite viewer interest. Furnad is encouraging CNN 
producers to identify such stories each day and use them to pace the newscast 
with emotion, not sound and pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a philosophy of pacing stories that has been around a long time," 
maintains Furnad, a former producer for ABC's "World News Tonight." "The budget 
is an emotional story, too, if you tell it correctly, and so was (that day's) 
story about a Supreme Court ruling on 'nuisance suits' by lawyers. The lead 
story is still the lead story, but if it's dull as sin, the second story should 
have emotional appeal. We live in an environment where people are watching a 
channel for three minutes and then pressing that clicker. We've got to get them 
watching and keep them watching in that environment." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for CNN now is to maintain its franchise (and influential 
audience) as the all-news network while enhancing its programming to attract 
new viewers and persuade its core audience to watch more. 
</P>
<P>
"The spine of the network will be breaking news, live," Ed Turner says. "We're 
the network that brought you months of the Oliver North trial -- and not just 
the Fawn Hall testimony -- and, if people don't want to watch it, tough, that's 
what we ought to be doing. But to grow in the 1990s, we need to both expand our 
international bureaus and do more in-depth reporting." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the prestige that its new investigative team may bring CNN, Turner 
maintains that it will also bring in viewers. "We'd like to win awards with it, 
of course," he says, "but I'm hoping that it will give us material that will 
bring in serious news viewers, making our newscasts better and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
CNN began airing the first reports from its "Special Assignment" investigative 
unit last Monday -- a four-part investigation into practices in college 
basketball. Originated by Ted Turner, the unit is headed by Pam Hill, who 
previously spent 10 years in charge of the award-winning documentary department 
at ABC News. Hill has recruited an impressive list of producers and reporters 
from both TV and print, from former NBC News political reporter Ken Bode to 
Brooks Jackson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter from The Wall Street Journal, 
along with documentary producers from "60 Minutes" and "CBS Reports." 
</P>
<P>
With an annual budget of several million dollars, "Special Assignment" is a 
departure for CNN, which began on the cheap, with non-union talent, many of 
them young people just out of college, and continues to be a place where bureau 
chiefs literally have to account for the number of notebooks they use. But if 
there is occasional grumbling about the unit's resources, it also is seen as a 
sign of the growth of CNN. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started out here 10 years ago, newsmakers didn't know who we were, and, 
on a public-affairs show here, I used to book the special assistant to the 
acting secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the President's commission on 
the metric system," jokes Wendy Walker, the 37-year-old Washington producer for 
CNN. "When we were in Poland recently, I saw Lech Walesa practicing his speech 
wearing a CNN T-shirt. The creation of the investigative unit is another good 
sign because it shows a real commitment to long-term, serious journalism." 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of Catherine Crier, however, seems to many at CNN to be a 
contradictory sign. Despite her lack of experience in journalism, Crier was 
hired to co-anchor the newscast that CNN introduced last October, "The World 
Today." The move has been criticized by TV reviewers and some CNN hands. "If 
you think she's got potential for television," one staffer argues, "why not 
send her out to do reporting? Otherwise, we're no different from the networks 
when they hire some attractive woman with little experience." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Amos, the CNN executive in charge of developing programming, defends the 
choice of Crier, saying, "She has skills in terms of questioning and 
interviewing as a prosecutor and judge. We hired her because we think she has 
the capability of being a good communicator, not simply someone reading copy." 
</P>
<P>
Amos believes that where CNN will make its mark in the next decade is in 
"coming up with breakthrough news programs that are more than news coverage." 
He once considered a news quiz show but abandoned that idea. "Whatever we do 
will be consistent with our news coverage," Amos promises. "We're not talking 
about a musical-variety news show." 
</P>
<P>
So what will it be, a Nairobi bureau or a new satellite uplink from Eastern 
Europe, a high-priced "star" anchor or a team of researchers to pore over 
documents looking for fraud? Cable News Network doesn't yet have to select 
among the competing visions of its future. But when it does, the choices it 
makes -- among hard news, analysis and the entertainment values of network TV 
-- will be televised live around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to examine every possibility to stay competitive in an environment 
where we're up against 50 different cable channels," Amos says. "If you sit 
there and do business as usual, thinking you've captured your market niche, 
you'll get buried."

PRIMITIVE ART: BREAKING NEW GROUND; 
</P>
<P>
'ART/ARTIFACT,' AT UCLA, EXAMINES THE DEGREE OF RACISM AND THE IMAGE OF WHITE 
SUPERIORITY IN PAST EXHIBITIONS OF AFRICAN OBJECTS

"ART/artifact," a new exhibition at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery, is an unusual, if 
not downright peculiar business. 
</P>
<P>
Galleries are chockablock with African objects organized by The Center for 
African Art, New York, but we are informed by the catalogue that the showing is 
not really necessarily about Africa or art at all. In fact, one catalogue 
essayist insists that such artifacts are not art, ever. The major thrust of the 
exhibition has to do with the way primitive art has been displayed in 
Euro-American cultures. This seems a bit like putting on a play that is about 
the design of the set. No need to evaluate the actors or the script, folks, 
just pay attention to the deep meanings of the drapes. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the script is crucial to this enterprise, which is co-sponsored for 
its local appearance by UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History. Faced with a 
hard choice you would understand the intentions of this exhibition more clearly 
by reading the catalogue than by attending the galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the physical setting is bad. Designer Tom Hartman and the Wight Art 
Gallery crew outdid themselves to re-create the four principal settings in 
which primitive art has been displayed: As souvenir in curiosity rooms; as 
educational information in natural history museums; for aesthetic pleasure in 
art museums; and as merchandise in commercial galleries. 
</P>
<P>
There are wall labels -- including one as fatuous as "How do Souvenirs Become 
Art?" -- but you can't really get the point without reading the catalogue. The 
essays carry varied, contradictory and sometimes important subtexts. Crucial 
here is the question of the degree of racism and the expression of white 
superiority that historically had fueled the collection of such work as posited 
in the essay by R. M. Gramly, a curator at the Buffalo Museum of Science. 
</P>
<P>
Since white self-afflatus crested in the 19th Century at the height of 
Euro-American imperialism, there was inescapably a large dose of white 
self-congratulation behind it. The fact that this exhibition exists proves that 
intelligent and caring people are now trying to purge past sins. So does the 
hotly debated issue over the degree of cultural damage or human disrespect that 
may have been wreaked on primitive cultures by the white man's mania for 
collecting. 
</P>
<P>
Anthropologists get into a righteous rage when art collectors jerk objects out 
of their native context without proper documentation, rendering them useless to 
scholarly understanding of the cultural woof and warp. Susan Vogel, director of 
the African Center and organizer of "ART/artifact," bemoans in her catalogue 
essay the way we display primitive art, further skewing its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The anthropologists' point seems more important than Vogel's, somehow. 
</P>
<P>
The show (on view to May 20) bears on large issues, one of which is white 
guilt. We are passing through a period when the white race is totting up its 
sins and feeling terrible, having apparently brought the planet to the brink of 
extinction. Surely, polluting the planet is bad stuff, and certainly the 
analogy can be extended to include racism, but historical mea culpas will not 
solve either problem. Humankind is ever imperfect. Each generation must play 
the hand it's dealt and try to fix things without rancor toward the past. 
</P>
<P>
This exhibition tries to be constructive but it seems to be attempting the 
undoable. The mind set at work here implies that there is some way to present 
primitive art to establish a single monumental interpretation of it. But, of 
course, everything is subject to interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest display-style re-created is a "Curiosity Room" from Hampton 
University circa 1905. Its craftsman style makes it the homiest of the spaces. 
It is filled with a mounted crocodile, stuffed heads of winsome gazelles, an 
African shield surrounded by a brace of spears and cases with souvenirs as 
commonplace as a beaded hat and as intense as a Bambole figure. It will strike 
some imaginations as an Ed Kienholz tableau about a rapacious hunter and 
colonialist. Others will see it as the memorabilia of a "Masterpiece Theater" 
colonel who was adventurous, energetic, curious and intelligent. Those who feel 
that simply collecting African art is somehow automatically insulting should be 
reminded that Hampton is a black university with an African collection. 
</P>
<P>
The main feature of the re-created natural history museum room is a life-size 
tableau of a tribal ceremony. How would the depicted figures feel if they saw 
it, flattered or humiliated? Suppose we went to an African museum and saw our 
club's initiation rite re-created George Segal-style. Might be sort of fun. To 
the seeker after facts, the room is educational. To the aesthete, it is a bore. 
</P>
<P>
The modern art museum room suggests a scaled-down version of the primitive wing 
of the Metropolitan Museum where Vogel was curator of African art for 10 years. 
Its spot-lit plexi cases certainly do not treat their contents with disdain. A 
cynic might find the work mythologized and overdramatized. This is particularly 
true here because the material, while good, does not come up to the 
overwhelming tribal masterpieces at the Met so the display seems overdone. 
</P>
<P>
Even though this art exhibition is not about art, its organizers seem to be 
doing their own form of special pleading by using objects of mainly middling 
quality. How can anybody appreciate the aesthetic side of the argument when the 
material is just so-so? 
</P>
<P>
A re-creation of a commercial primitive art gallery presents a forest of quite 
similar Mikenda memorial effigies that seem intended to dramatize the "reduced 
to ordinary merchandise" polemic of the display. It seems a little sentimental. 
Even Van Gogh survives being occasionally put on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
But, then of course, it may be that none of this is art at all. Maybe we've 
been walking around all these years in the grip of an aesthetic illusion. 
That's what Arthur C. Danto thinks. He's a distinguished professor of 
philosophy at Columbia University, an occasional critic and the essayist who 
says that African artifacts are not art even if Picasso says they are. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Picasso was less carried away by the formal qualities of the objects 
he found at Paris' Musee de l'Homme than in what he derived from them about the 
role of the artist as shamanistic magician. 
</P>
<P>
Danto's argument may be philosophically sound, but I don't think one can get 
around the multiple meanings of the word "art." Among other things it's an 
honorific we use to describe anything that seems to outstrip ordinary 
categories. If a carpenter does extraordinary work we praise him by calling him 
an artist. If one African mask stands out with special power among many similar 
ones then it becomes an artistic masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
The creative enterprise just won't work unless the meaning of the word "art" 
itself remains slippery, allowing for discovery of artwork whether it's a 
Duchamp bicycle wheel or a venerated Japanese tree. 
</P>
<P>
There is also creative misinterpretation. I once read a catalogue for a 
primitive exhibition that included a picture of a native happily wearing a 
Quaker Oats box as a hat. The author was furious on the native's behalf, 
stewing on about how this was insulting to the poor chap. But he had picked it 
out as something he found colorful, pretty and meaningful at least as headgear. 
Maybe he saw something we missed. Of course scientists have to keep the facts 
straight but if the artist in each of us finds marvel and substance in a work 
considered ordinary by its maker we may have found something in it he missed.

HIGHWAYMEN : ON THE ROAD AGAIN;

<P>
This is the last cowboy song 
</P>
<P>
The end of a hundred year waltz 
</P>
<P>
The voices sound sad as they're singing along 
</P>
<P>
Another piece of America's lost. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Last Cowboy Song" by Ed Bruce and Ron Peterson 
</P>
<P>
Standing next to each other on stage at the Rosemont Horizon Arena, Willie 
Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson look like -- and 
represent -- a living Mt. Rushmore of country music. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors of a collective 12 marriages, more than 115 years on the road and 
untold bottles of whiskey and pills, these legendary veterans of America's 
honky-tonks and highways have put their wild times behind them and now call 
themselves the Highwaymen -- after a Jimmy Webb song that was the title of 
their million-selling joint album in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For years, however, they were known in Nashville as "outlaws" because of their 
renegade lifestyles and artistic independence -- their refusal to tailor their 
music to bland, crossover-pop guidelines that rob country music of its 
tradition and soul. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than dance to Nashville's tune, each of the four introduced his own 
beat. They wore their hair long, had as much of an ear for Bob Dylan as for 
Hank Williams, courted young rock audiences as well as older country ones and 
put together ambitious concept albums rather than just three-minute jukebox 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
So, it was no surprise that the nearly 10,000 people in the Rosemont Horizon 
audience -- teen-agers to grandparents -- responded wildly at the first notes 
of their songs about restless idealism and troubled times. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a melancholy edge to the first-ever tour by the four veteran 
singer-songwriters. While celebrating the great country-music tradition, the 
shows also raised questions about the tradition's future. 
</P>
<P>
Country music continues to develop best-sellers, but it hasn't produced a male 
artist of Mt. Rushmore stature since Nelson, Jennings, Kristofferson and Merle 
Haggard arrived in the late '60s. (Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton are two 
female greats from the late '60s and '70s). 
</P>
<P>
Instead of strong individuals singing meaningful songs, the top of the charts 
is generally filled now with creditable vocalists who either imitate the old 
country greats or bury all traces of emotion under lush arrangements in hopes 
of another "Urban Cowboy" crossover to the pop market. 
</P>
<P>
Is another piece of America being lost? 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder about that," Cash said shortly after the Rosemont Horizon concert. 
"There hasn't been a new Kristofferson in 20 years, or a new Nelson or Jennings 
. . . someone who made a difference in the business . . . someone who came 
along stepping out where no man has gone before in our business. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is the 'Urban Cowboy' syndrome, Nashville (record executives) still 
trying to sell country records to the people who are buying cowboy boots in New 
York City. I worry about it a lot, but don't like to think of this tour as a 
last round-up. I'd like to believe it's an inspiration, a new beginning." 
</P>
<P>
It's a measure of people who don't understand 
</P>
<P>
The pleasures of being in a hillbilly band. 
</P>
<P>
I got my first guitar when I was 14 
</P>
<P>
Now I'm over 30 and I'm still wearing jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Amanda" by Bob McDill 
</P>
<P>
Jennings, a Buddy Holly protege who became arguably the most dynamic country 
singer of his generation, was in his late 30s when he recorded "Amanda" in 
1974, and he's proud that the lyrics still apply. He's over 50 now, but still 
wearing jeans. 
</P>
<P>
"The pleasures of being in a hillbilly band?" he said, repeating the reporter's 
question as he waited outside a Chicago hotel in his shiny Silver Eagle bus for 
the ride to Detroit, where the Highwaymen were to perform next. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think that Jennings would have an answer ready after singing the song 
some 2,000 times. But he paused. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the freedom," he said tentatively, as if he's never been able to 
adequately define what being a country music star means to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in a cowboy band is a way of getting through life without having to give 
in -- and the jeans is part of it. People used to tell us to dress differently, 
sing differently, make records differently because that was the way to get 
ahead in Nashville," Jennings continued. 
</P>
<P>
"But we weren't interested in just getting ahead. I didn't see why a country 
singer couldn't do a Beatles song as well as a Hank Williams song, or why we 
had to wear sequins on our pants. Johnny and Willie and Kris all felt the same 
way and that made us outsiders. But we fought and we won." 
</P>
<P>
Like Cash, however, Jennings worries about some of the trends in country music 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to sound like rock 'n' roll did in the '70s, when everything 
seemed mass production -- no more personality or character," he said. "Every 
record is starting to sound alike." 
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews, Kristofferson and Nelson also complained about country 
music's tradition and spirit being endangered by record company executives and 
radio programmers who want safe, easily digested records rather than 
challenging or adventurous ones. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in country music agrees. 
</P>
<P>
A few country music executives say privately that they suspect an element of 
sour grapes in the Highwaymen's complaints about the state of country music 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can ever take away what Willie and Waylon and Johnny and Kris did for 
country music," said one record man who asked not to be quoted because he 
considers himself a friend of the musicians. "But times change. New favorites 
emerge and that's what happened with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Their tour is an example," he said. "They used to be able to headline arenas 
by themselves, but they have to join together to sell that many tickets. 
They'll still have hit records, but they won't be the force anymore that they 
once were. Nobody stays on top forever." 
</P>
<P>
Lon Helton, country editor of the trade magazine Radio &amp; Records, thinks 
many of the Highwaymen's complaints about the slick "Urban Cowboy" syndrome are 
out of date. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it, the 'Urban Cowboy' days (of the early '80s) gave us a 
lot of overproduced music, but things have changed greatly. There's an emphasis 
again on traditional artists and I feel the envelope of country music is wider 
and deeper than it has ever been." 
</P>
<P>
Helton and others interviewed nominated numerous artists when asked about 
people who might eventually be considered the equal of a Cash or a Nelson. 
Among those named: Randy Travis, Clint Black, Kathy Mattea, Dwight Yoakam, 
Garth Brooks, Ricky Van Shelton, the O'Kanes. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Lyle Lovett and k. d. lang, who won Grammys this year for best male 
and female country vocalists, were also cited (see box on Page 77), but several 
experts questioned whether the two artists are really committed to country. 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, came even close to suggesting that any contemporary artist yet 
approaches the influence or talent of any of the Highwaymen. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Daniels, general program manager of award-winning KNIX-FM/KCW-AM radio in 
Phoenix, declared, "I have great expectations for the future of country music, 
however, today's breed of artists are sound-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at Johnny Cash, Kristofferson, Willie and Waylon, each has such 
an individuality. There's no way you could mistake them. They all helped 
reshape country music. No one since can really make that claim." 
</P>
<P>
The teaming of those four singers on the tour -- which coincided with the 
release of the "Highwayman 2" album -- was especially touching for Cash's wife, 
June Carter, a descendent of the original Carter 
</P>
<P>
Family -- the first group to be elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has seen all the greats of the music since the '40s -- sharing a stage 
with everyone from Williams to Presley, but this tour has special meaning for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something just warm and good about this show," she said during a sound 
check for the Chicago show. "You can tell they're friends and that they are 
having fun. I also see survivors and it it almost makes me cry. I want to say, 
'Thank you God,' . . . They've all been through hell and fire water. 
</P>
<P>
"But I always knew they'd all be all right because I think God touches certain 
people . . . that He gives them the talent and the experience so that they can 
help other people with their music . . . help heal the heartbreaks and lift the 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
He's a poet, he's a prophet 
</P>
<P>
He's a pusher, he's a pilgrim 
</P>
<P>
And a preacher and a problem when he's stoned. 
</P>
<P>
He's a walkin' contradiction 
</P>
<P>
Partly truth and partly fiction 
</P>
<P>
Takin' every wrong direction 
</P>
<P>
on his lonely way back home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Pilgrim: Chapter 33" by Kris Kristofferson 
</P>
<P>
Kristofferson sometimes seems the "baby" of the Highwaymen because he takes 
such good care of himself physically, running and working out with weights. Yet 
at 53, Kristofferson, who is as well known as an actor as a musician because of 
roles in such films as "A Star is Born" and "Heaven's Gate," is a year older 
than Jennings and only slightly younger than Nelson (56) and Cash (58). 
</P>
<P>
Another reason Kristofferson appears part of a different generation is that he 
was the last of the four to arrive in Nashville. He's also separated from the 
others by background. Nelson, Jennings and Cash grew up in small towns in Texas 
(Nelson and Jennings) or Arkansas (Cash), dreaming about following the mournful 
wail of the passing trains to the big city. 
</P>
<P>
Kristofferson, on the other hand, didn't grow up in rural isolation -- or 
poverty. He was the quintessential All-American boy: the son of an Air Force 
general, a Golden Gloves boxer, a Rhodes Scholar, a teaching post at West 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
But he turned his back on it all in the mid-'60s and went to Nashville to write 
songs. To support himself and to be close to the singers he wanted to pitch, 
Kristofferson worked as a janitor at Columbia Records' recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ivey, executive director of the Country Music Foundation, says one of 
Kristofferson's greatest contributions to country music was his infusion of the 
urban perspective into what had been chiefly a rural tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Kris wrote about the everyday concerns of adults living in a kind of urban 
society and dealing with problems of relationships in really tough, hard-edged 
songs. As a writer, he probably had as great an impact on Nashville as Hank 
Williams did. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the quality most needed in Nashville today -- that hard-hitting kind of 
against-the-grain, never-say-die spirit that Kristofferson and Cash and the 
others had." 
</P>
<P>
Cash, Jennings and Nelson were already heroes to Kristofferson by the time he 
settled in Nashville. He not only tried to write some songs tailored for their 
styles, but also used them as subject matter for songs. 
</P>
<P>
In songs such as "The Pilgrim: Chapter 33" and "Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down," he 
wrote about the self-destructiveness and idealism of the Nashville music scene 
in the late '60s 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that period, Kristofferson said: "I fell in with a group of writers 
in Nashville that you might call the underground, . . . people who thought 
songs were something meant to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember we would stay up for days after days at a time, take whatever 
you needed to keep going. You had a tradition of crazy poets and artists. To 
think that Hank Williams did everything he did and then he died when he wasn't 
even 30 doesn't tell you to sit back and pace yourself." 
</P>
<P>
If the Outlaws once flirted with danger, times have changed. They are healthy 
now. Jennings, who underwent triple bypass surgery in 1988, carries an exercise 
bike with him on the bus. Cash, who underwent double coronary artery bypass the 
same year, praises the virtues of a fruit-protein drink he enjoys each morning 
for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
One of the joys of Nelson's day is holding his 15-month-old son, Luke. 
Kristofferson jogs every morning. The tour too is a real family affair, with 
children and all the wives -- or, in Nelson's case, his steady companion and 
Luke's mother, makeup artist Angie D'Angelo. 
</P>
<P>
Enthused about the response on the brief Highwaymen swing, the four singers are 
now thinking about a West Coast tour, possibly in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda, light of my life 
</P>
<P>
Fate should have made you 
</P>
<P>
A gentleman's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Amanda" by Bob McDill 
</P>
<P>
Jennings' bus driver is named Steve Miller, but everyone calls him Dog, a 
nickname he inherited from his father. "I started out as Pup for years," he 
said with a touch of pride. 
</P>
<P>
It was just after 1 a.m. and Dog was waiting for the signal from the drivers in 
Nelson's and Kristofferson's buses that they were ready to roll to the next 
city. Cash prefers to sleep in the hotel, then travel by bus to the next city 
in the morning. The others, however, like the road late at night when 
everything's dark and mysterious and a bit more romantic. 
</P>
<P>
"What's holding us up?" Jennings asked the driver, who explained that the crew 
was still loading some equipment on another bus. 
</P>
<P>
The customized buses -- which cost between $300,000 and $500,000 and get about 
five miles per gallon -- travel together, out of a spirit of kinship and so 
that help is available in case of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings is a ruggedly handsome man with a surprisingly quick humor and a 
playful, puppy-dog disposition -- now that he has bid farewell to the demons 
that possessed him during his pill days, a time when even his friends sometimes 
stepped back and gave him room when he approached. 
</P>
<P>
The road late at night is a good time for reminiscing, and Jennings talked 
easily about the old times as the bus moved down the highway. He talked about 
the time when he first came to Nashville in the mid-'60s in a new yellow 
Cadillac. He put 300,000 miles on the car touring before stepping up to an old 
Dodge motor home. 
</P>
<P>
But he mainly talked about people -- how he roomed briefly with Cash, a teaming 
that generated tales of wild times that are legendary in country music. Often 
high on pills, both men, the story goes, would kick down the apartment door as 
often as unlock it because they'd lose their keys. 
</P>
<P>
Jessi Colter, Jennings' wife for just over 20 years and a singer-songwriter who 
had a Top 10 pop-country hit in 1975 with "I'm Not Lisa," sat next to her 
husband on one of the padded seats near the front of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
Almost an hour after discussing the line in "Amanda" about the joys of being in 
a hillbilly band, Jennings returned to the song. "You know what other line hits 
me every time I sing it? The one about a gentleman's wife. I think of Jessi. 
</P>
<P>
"She was what made me finally quit (drugs). I looked at her face one day and I 
could see what I was doing to her, the pain I was causing. Nothing else had 
been enough. . . . The fact that I almost ruined my voice, that I couldn't even 
see straight some nights on stage." 
</P>
<P>
None of the Highwaymen likes to talk about leaving the road, but Jennings seems 
the one who might be able to live easiest without it. He says he usually gets 
restless after a few weeks at home, but he also misses his 10-year-old son, 
Shooter. He hopes to concentrate on summer tours so that he can bring Shooter 
along, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny how your dreams and goals change over the years," he said. "You 
know what my ambition is now? I want to live to see what he becomes. All of my 
other children are grown now and doing well, but there is something special 
about him. I guess it's the fact that I had him so late in life that I realized 
I have to give him a lot real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 On the road again 
</P>
<P>
 Just can't wait to get on the road again 
</P>
<P>
The life I love is making music with my friends 
</P>
<P>
 And I can't wait to get on the road again 
</P>
<P>
 -- "On the Road Again" by Willie Nelson 
</P>
<P>
Gates Moore -- "Gator" to his friends -- didn't like the way ice was forming on 
the side mirrors the next night as he steered Nelson's bus, the "Honeysuckle 
Rose," from Detroit to Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
If the temperature on this chilly, late-night run dropped even another degree 
or two, Gator -- who has driven Nelson's tour bus for almost 10 years -- feared 
the roads would become so treacherous that he'd have to reduce his speed to 20 
m.p.h. or less, which could add four to five hours to the more than 12-hour 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the lounge area, Nelson, who spends more than 200 days a year on the 
road, didn't care if the trip took a few more hours. He's more comfortable on 
the bus than he is in hotel rooms. In fact, he often stays out in the bus in 
the parking lot rather than go into the hotel with his band members, most of 
whom travel on a separate bus. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled a videocassette from a shelf and slipped it into the VCR. "This is a 
promotional tape that explains the Cowboy Channel that we're hoping to put on 
the air this fall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Against a fanfare of music, the narrator's voice declared: "The Cowboy Channel 
is for the free spirit in all of us . . . from the back roads to the board 
rooms, Americans are celebrating their heritage." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cable channel's lineup will include old Western TV shows, 
including "The Rifleman" and "Bonanza," as well as original music programming. 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys were Nelson's first heroes -- symbols during his childhood almost 50 
years ago in Abbott, Tex. of an independence and freedom that exempted adults 
from the routine of regular, 9-to-5 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But cowboys had largely disappeared from the American scene by the time Nelson 
was old enough to strap on spurs, so he turned in the late '50s to what looked 
like the next best thing. He became a country-music singer. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson had some early success, writing such hits as "Crazy" for Patsy Cline and 
"Night Life" for Ray Price, but he found that the hard-core emotion of early 
heroes like Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell was no longer in vogue in 
Nashville by the time he arrived there in the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
The pop-country Nashville sound, with its lush strings and soothing, anonymous 
background vocals, was prized on record because it had the best chance of 
crossing over into the pop market. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson helped country regain its passion and emotion. He gave up on 
Nashville in the late '60s, returning to Texas where he built a 
redneck-longhair coalition that was the core of the "Outlaw" movement. His long 
hair, jeans and red bandanna on stage still reflect the cross-cultural mix of 
those days. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has enjoyed the best record sales in recent years of any of the 
Highwaymen, but even his are well below what they were for much of the '70s and 
early '80s, when concept albums such as "The Red Headed Stranger" and 
"Stardust" were multimillion-sellers. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to rebuild his momentum, Nelson has gone along with Columbia 
Records' desires to make his music sound a bit more polished. He in effect 
turned creative control of his next scheduled album over to an old pal, veteran 
producer Fred Foster, and simply went in and did the vocals. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Montgomery, a Columbia Records executive in Nashville, is delighted with 
the results. He thinks there may be five hit singles in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, however, seemed a bit uncertain as he listened to the record on the 
bus. He wondered if some of the character of his music hadn't been sacrificed. 
When the album ended, he replaced it in the tape deck with another album -- a 
collection of old country standards that he shelved, he said, because he didn't 
sense any interest in it by Columbia. He seemed more moved by the second tape 
and spoke about someday releasing it, perhaps on his own label. 
</P>
<P>
When that tape ended, Nelson stared through the window, into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Does he ever get tired of all the bus trips and all the nights on the road? 
</P>
<P>
"No way," he said quietly. "It's like that Billy Joe Shaver line, 'Movin's the 
closest thing to being free.' I think there's some truth in that. I've never 
stayed in one place for long. I worked a lot of sit-down jobs in the early days 
out of necessity, but I was always wishing that Hank Thompson or one of those 
big bands would hire me so I could step onto the bus with them. . . . and I've 
never wanted to get off since." 
</P>
<P>
But if this world keeps on a turnin' 
</P>
<P>
For the better or the worse 
</P>
<P>
And all he ever gets is older and around 
</P>
<P>
From the rockin' of the cradle 
</P>
<P>
To the rollin' of the hearse 
</P>
<P>
The goin' up was worth the comin' down. 
</P>

 -- "The Pilgrim: Chapter 33" by Kris Kristofferson 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Cash is known in country music as the Man in Black because he favors 
black shirts and pants on stage to underscore his support for the underdog. But 
he was wearing a green shirt as he sat in his Minneapolis hotel room just 
before noon the day of a show at the Met Center. 
</P>
<P>
A portable word processor was by his side, rather than a guitar. His jaw was 
severely swollen, the aftermath of some dental work done before the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm writing a book," he said in that deep, distinctive Southern drawl. "Got 
about 120 pages done on that word processor. I love that thing. I wrote my 
other two books by hand and it was like carving in stone. 
</P>
<P>
Though Cash came out of Memphis' Sun Records in the late '50s with Elvis 
Presley and Carl Perkins, he stayed with country rather than move into rock 
because he had grown up idolizing country singers Hank Williams and the late 
Jimmie Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
But he took country music in new directions, mixing elements of folk and blues 
as he tried to capture in song elements of the working man's life in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder what would happen if I were starting out today in the music 
business," he said. "I think the only job I'd be able to get would be singing 
in a coffee house somewhere because that's where I could sing songs that 
mattered to me. I sure couldn't get into singing most of the things you hear on 
the radio." 
</P>
<P>
Cash paused as his wife, June Carter, handed him a glass of his favorite 
protein drink. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this tour is going to make a difference in our business," he said, 
finally. "Sometimes I feel the people in charge of this business today are 
looking for someone who looks good in a video when they should be looking for 
someone who has something real to say. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got 33 songs on the show and I think they are all important. The 
reviewer in Detroit said something about it being a nostalgia thing, but it 
really isn't. The songs are just as now and as alive as they ever were because 
a good song is about real life and real emotions and those things don't get out 
of date."

NOTEBOOK: CHEF CLAUDE SEGAL: THE NEXT KING OF SPAS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

Claude Segal, one of the more peripatetic of our local chefs (and one of the 
best), has left his latest berth at MaBe in West Hollywood to take over the 
kitchen at tennis guru John Gardiner's new Rancho Valencia resort in Rancho 
Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
"I was offered a great opportunity," says Segal, who came to Los Angeles in 
1982 when Patrick Terrail hired him to replace Wolfgang Puck. "The place just 
has so much potential. The resort is small, with only about 45 rooms, all of 
them individual bungalows, done in the Santa Fe style. There's a beautiful 
dining room, with a lot of open patio space, and a perfect kitchen." The dining 
room, which will function as an independent restaurant open to the public as 
well as resort guests, has just been given a name: Tapenade (the 
olive-and-caper puree popular in Provence). 
</P>
<P>
"My first idea," Segal says, "is to build the reputation of the restaurant. 
Then I'd like to develop a kind of spa, something like Michel Guerard's place 
in southwestern France, where people could come and spend a week having very 
healthy food. And eventually, maybe by the beginning of next year, I would like 
to open a cooking school here." 
</P>
<P>
The food at Tapenade, Segal says, will 
</P>
<P>
be light and modern French in style, "more like what I used to do before MaBe." 
He will try to use a lot of local ingredients. "You know," he points out, 
"we're just five minutes from Chino Ranch (the top-notch specialty produce 
farm). I can walk there almost." 
</P>
<P>
Segal's parting from MaBe was amicable, he says. He's even retaining a 
consultant relationship with the restaurant, visiting the kitchen several times 
a month. Meanwhile, the establishment's new head chef is Eric Cunin, who worked 
under Segal at Bistango and Wave. 
</P>
<P>
LA BREA BREAKFAST: In the usual order of things, restaurants open for dinner at 
first and then, if business seems to warrant it, open for lunch. The popular 
Campanile on La Brea has done it a bit differently: They're still considering 
lunch, but in the meantime, have opened for breakfast. The menu, says co-owner 
(and bake-master) Nancy Silverton, is "very simple, very limited, sort of like 
(Berkeley's) Cafe Fanny." Offerings include poached duck eggs with toast, 
Silverton's granola, her own Bulgarian-style yogurt, walnut bread with warm 
goat cheese on top, and assorted other breads (toasted) from Silverton's 
splendid La Brea Bakery next door. "You order at the counter," says Silverton, 
"and we bring the food to you, either in the courtyard or the bar." Breakfast 
is served Monday through Saturday, from 8 to 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE FRONT BURNER: Sanwa Bank hosts the third annual Pasadena Pizza Expo, a 
benefit for the Boys Club of Pasadena, today from 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the 
Pasadena Convention Center. At least a score of restaurants and pizza parlors 
will participate -- among them Domenicos of Duarte, Cabo Cabo Cabo, Picasso's, 
Roxxi, La Grotta di Capri and (this I gotta taste) Kuala Lumpur. Live music and 
a pizza-eating contest are featured, and tickets are $12 at the door. . . . The 
Rangoon Racquet Club in Beverly Hills presents a multicourse Passover seder, 
beginning at sundown on Monday, April 9. "A heady mix of the traditional and 
the ritual" is promised. The fare is $50 per adult, $35 per child. . . . La 
Bruschetta in Westwood serves a kosher Passover seder on the 9th, conducted by 
Jerry Cutler and cantor Hale Porter of the Los Angles Creative Arts Temple. The 
cost is $50 per person, including kosher wine. . . . Koutoubia in West Los 
Angeles will be closed the 9th, but offers kosher Passover dinners in the 
Moroccan style for take-out that evening. For $35 per person, the repast 
includes assorted Moroccan salads, a choice of assorted chicken or lamb dishes 
(for instance, chicken with preserved lemon or lamb with fresh artichokes), and 
fresh fruit. . . . And New York's Anne Rosenzweig, chef and co-owner of Arcadia 
and president and CEO of the "21" Club, both in New York City, will teach 
dishes from "The Arcadia Seasonal Mural Cookbook" at the Epicurean in West 
Hollywood April 12 and 13. The fee is $75 per class, each of which will feature 
different recipes. Call (213) 659-5990 for details.

ANNIVERSARIES: Knoll's Black Forest Inn in Santa Monica celebrates its 30th 
birthday this month. It opened on Santa Monica Boulevard near Ocean Avenue, and 
then moved to its present location on Wilshire near 24th in the early 1980s 
(Knoll's maintains an excellent German wine list, incidentally -- easily the 
best in Los Angeles -- for those who might like to sample these largely 
excellent but, in America, little-known vintages). . . . Another longtime Santa 
Monica resident, Ye Olde King's Head Pub &amp; Restaurant, is 17 this year. . . 
. And the St. Moritz in Studio City observes its 16th anniversary with a series 
of complete dinners for $18 per person, tomorrow through Friday.

A GROWING APPETITE FOR BISTROS IN THE CITY OF LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bistro-mania continues to sweep France. Such noted chefs as Roger Verge on the 
Cote d'Azur, Francis Garcia in Bordeaux and Michel Rostang and Guy Savoy here 
in Paris have launched bistros, supplementing their well-known formal 
restaurants. More recently, when Jacques Maximin opened his elaborate Maximin 
restaurant in Nice, he installed the modest Bistro de Nice next door. 
</P>
<P>
And in Paris, traditionally the bistro capital of France, new examples of the 
genre have lately been inaugurated by Andre Genin, proprietor of Chez Pauline 
(and, like Michel Rostang, one of the French-based chefs who cooks and consults 
on a regular basis for Fennel in Santa Monica); by veteran Parisian 
restaurateur Claude Terrail (uncle of Ma Maison creator and proprietor Patrick 
Terrail), and by Jean-Pierre Vigato of Apicius, which is one of the hottest 
serious restaurants in Paris today. 
</P>
<P>
The virtues of the bistro -- its modest scale, its informality, its reasonable 
prices, its comforting style of food -- are appealing to the public for obvious 
reasons. For famous chefs and restaurateurs the appeal lies in quick turnover 
of customers and lower expenses -- it's fast money. Bistros are also places for 
chefs to hang out, something they can't do in their formal restaurants. And 
then there's the nostalgia factor: Bistro food is, in theory, the food these 
chefs grew up on. 
</P>
<P>
But I hope Andre Genin didn't grow up on food resembling that served at his Le 
Rond de Serviette ("The Napkin-Ring") -- and, frankly, I can't imagine him 
wanting to hang out in the restaurant. The place is strangely 
artificial-looking, with its walls of red cloth alternating with thin beige 
paneling, its gaudy floral-patterned upholstery, its indifferent old-bistro 
photo blowups. 
</P>
<P>
It seems not so much a genuine bistro, in fact, as some American chain hotel 
coffee shop in Paris that has decided to call itself a bistro. I had the 
impression, the evening I was there, that everybody in the place seemed to be 
looking around at their neighbors wondering if they were really in the right 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of a dinner there, it was clear that they were not. 
</P>
<P>
All three varieties of fish in the assortment of mousse-like rillettes de 
l'ocean tasted alike, and were entirely too homogeneous for rillettes -- rather 
like tuna salad put through a Cuisinart. A warm goat cheese salad was made with 
indifferent cheese and tired greens. Hachis Parmentier, a kind of shredded 
beef-and-potato casserole, was strangely flavorless, and the potatoes seemed 
starchy. 
</P>
<P>
Only a nice piece of grilled salmon with a suspicion of old-style sauce vierge 
(sort of a creamy mayonnaise) was agreeable to eat -- and it was nothing 
special. To anyone who has enjoyed Genin's cooking, as I have, either at Chez 
Pauline in Paris or at Fennel in Santa Monica, the problems at Le Rond de 
Serviette are mystifying. I can only assume that he just isn't paying attention 
to the place -- and can only hope that he will soon start doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Terrail most obviously is paying attention to his bistro, Rotisserie du 
Beaujolais. The place is plain, with terra-cotta floors, uncluttered walls and 
a crowd of little white-dressed tables spilling out onto the slightly sloping 
sidewalk. The menu is minuscule, offering no more than four or five appetizers 
and a like number of main dishes daily. The kitchen is skilled, but it sticks 
to the basics. The food is hearty and good. The style here is resolutely 
Lyonnais -- the great French food and wine capital of Lyon being more or less 
the Vatican of the bistro genre. 
</P>
<P>
Terrail brings all of his cheeses and sausages in from top suppliers in that 
city, in fact -- reportedly the same ones that provision Paul Bocuse. And 
almost the only wines available are those of Georges DuBoeuf, whose bailiwick 
is Lyon's neighbor, the Beaujolais region. 
</P>
<P>
Though the menu changes daily, a typical selection might include tomato salad; 
hure (pork headcheese); saucisson de Lyon (Lyonnais sausage, firm, medium-dry 
and thinly sliced), or leeks vinaigrette to begin with, and then quail or veal 
chops roasted on the eponymous rotisserie; grilled onglet (flank steak) with 
shallots, or a traditional Lyonnais dish called sabodet rotie au Beaujolais -- 
a coarsely ground and highly flavorful pig's-head sausage, cut into thick 
slices and oven-roasted in Beaujolais. Vegetarians and dainty eaters need not 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
The cheeses offered are always the same: a selection of first-class chevres 
from both Lyon and Beaujolais, and a Lyonnais specialty colorfully dubbed 
cervelle de canut or "silk weaver's brain" -- fresh white cheese mixed with 
chives, salt and pepper and white wine. (The cheese was supposedly a favorite 
snack of the silk weavers who were once so plentiful around Lyon.) There is 
usually a superb apple tart -- a quintessential bistro dessert if ever there 
was one. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists might very well argue that Jean-Pierre Vigato's Manufacture -- 
so named because it is located in an old but beautifully renovated tobacco 
manufacture (manufactory), just outside the Paris city limits in 
Issy-les-Moulineaux -- isn't really a bistro at all. Indeed, it looks like a 
contemporary full-scale restaurant in a sort of trans-Atlantic style, with 
exposed structural-beam ceilings, white cinder-block walls, big paintings hung 
here and there, Post-Modern furniture and high-design Andree Putman Royal 
Limoges china. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is hardly in the old-school bistro idiom, either. But there are some 
bistro dishes offered (e.g. a Burgundian-style salad scattered with lardons or 
chunks of bacon and topped with an egg poached in red wine, or a simple 
presentation of eggs soft-scrambled with smoked haddock) and the menu is full 
of offal and cheaper cuts of meat, potatoes, pulses (lentils, white beans, 
etc.) and little salads -- all typical of bistro fare. Best of all, though, the 
prices are genuinely bistro-low. 
</P>
<P>
The imagination behind the dishes and the quality of the cooking aren't 
bistro-ish at all. Categories aside, Manufacture is simply one of the best new 
restaurants of any kind in Paris. As evidence of that claim, I offer a 
gelatin-based terrine of baby rabbit or lapereau, delicate but full of flavor, 
offset by a perfect little lentil salad; a whole small pate encased in a light 
pastry shell -- meat loaf for grown-ups -- served with a Provencal-style salad 
of mixed bitter greens; a filet of daurade grise, a remarkably delicious 
variety of sea bream, covered with still-firm diced vegetables and soaking in a 
light olive-flavored broth; a combination of filet and joue or jowl of beef, 
grilled and cushioned with split-pea puree. 
</P>
<P>
To clinch the case, I must mention Manufacture's selection of wickedly good but 
yet somehow not quite excessive desserts -- among them a wisp of caramelized 
pate feuillete with a slice of French-style gingerbread and a scoop of 
gingerbread ice cream, a kind of collapsed chocolate souffle with very dark 
chocolate ice cream on the side, a rich and chewy praline-chocolate tart, and a 
specialty called simply riz croquante -- which suggests a cross between rice 
pudding and creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts of this sophistication, of course, might well be taken as definitive 
proof that Manufacture is not, in fact, a bistro after all. But when the food 
is this good, and this reasonably priced, who, in fact, cares?

An 8-mile-long fuel slick caused by a landslide floated south down the 
Allegheny River, threatening drinking water for tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Fumes from the spill forced the evacuation of 100 people. The Coast Guard used 
booms to try to contain the spill. A 10-inch pipeline was cracked by the 
landslide about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh near Freeport, Pa. About 75,000 
gallons of "transmix" -- a combination of diesel fuel, gasoline and oil -- ran 
into Knapp Run Creek and then into the river. Thousands of residents north of 
Pittsburgh were told to conserve water because intake valves had been shut to 
protect water supplies.

THE UPHEAVAL IN SAN FRANCISCO THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S 'A TURNOVER IN GENERATIONS' AS MANY OF THE OLD GUARD LEAVE THE SCENE

This city's theater scene has long been dominated by artists grounded in the 
experimental drama of the 1960s, but a recent rash of resignations suggests 
that the 1990s will see significant changes on -- and behind -- Bay Area 
stages. With the grudging acknowledgement in this city that it has been 
replaced by Los Angeles as California's theater capital, the next few years may 
prove crucial to the Bay Area's cultural health. 
</P>
<P>
Several veteran figures in the San Francisco theater community have announced 
their departures in 1990, including directors of the Magic Theatre and the 
Berkeley Repertory Theatre, the drama critic of the San Francisco Chronicle and 
the director of Theatre Bay Area, a service organization for theaters and drama 
professionals here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly a turnover in generations," said Bernard Weiner, who resigned in 
March after 16 years as the Chronicle's drama critic. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us have been around for 15 or 20 years, and mid-life crises creep up 
even on theater people," he said. "I'd been going to an average of 225 shows a 
year -- most of them not worth seeing -- and I was just burned out." 
</P>
<P>
Weiner said that theater in the Bay Area had lost its vitality in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"After the cultural upheaval of the '60s, there was a high point in San 
Francisco," he said. "The mid-'70s to early '80s were a high watermark for all 
sorts of theater. Then, coincidental with the Reagan decade, things hit a 
plateau and have stayed there for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Many agree with Weiner's sorry assessment of Bay Area theater. Prof. David 
Littlejohn, who teaches cultural reporting at UC Berkeley's journalism school, 
said that the drama community has become increasingly polarized between 
theaters specializing in Broadway revivals and those favoring obscure, 
performance art-style works. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco theater "seem to be at a dead end. It's abandoning plays and 
players in favor of some kind of gestural personal dynamic thing that's 
supposed to get through to you on some unconscious level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty insubstantial. There isn't much to say about it, isn't much to 
think about it," he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the theater structures in the Bay Area can encourage new writing, I 
just don't know," he said. "We'll just have to wait for something new to come 
along, but it doesn't look very promising." As a critic, Weiner, 50, was 
well-regarded in theater circles here, particularly for his interest in 
smaller, non-commercial productions. He said he would turn his attention to 
directing plays, and to writing plays and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Weiner is Gerald Nachman, 52, a Chronicle entertainment columnist 
known for his preference for cabaret and musicals over avant-garde theater. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to view theater as entertainment -- show biz, if you will -- and not as 
an arcane academic pursuit," Nachman said. "I hope to make our theater coverage 
accessible to more readers, not fewer." 
</P>
<P>
Noting the great influence Chronicle reviews have on ticket sales, some at 
non-commercial theaters have expressed concern at Nachman's selection. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're scared of me, but I'll try to calm them as much as I can," he 
said. "My appointment means only great things for the San Francisco theater 
community: they can look forward to an unending series of raves," he jested. 
But he did say that the Chronicle would pay less attention to alternative 
theater than it had. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding which shows merit coverage, Nachman said, "We have to ask 
ourselves, are most readers really going to care about this? To be frank, a lot 
of the small productions here are just vanity productions, done for theater 
people and not the playgoing public." 
</P>
<P>
At the Magic Theatre, the resignation of artistic director John Lion, who 
founded the troupe at a Berkeley bar 23 years ago, also suggests the closing of 
an era. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic, which now operates three stages at San Francisco's Fort Mason 
Center, gained national attention during Sam Shepard's tenure as playwright in 
residence. Shepard's "Fool for Love," "Inacoma," "True West" and "Buried Child" 
(which later won the Pulitzer Prize) all had their premieres at the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Since Shepard's departure in the early '80s, however, the Magic's prominence 
has faded. "We entered a period you might call the 'Post-Shepard Hangover,' " 
said Harvey Seifter, the managing director. "One era had ended, and a new one 
hadn't yet begun." 
</P>
<P>
The theater has concentrated on familiar works by such playwrights as Beckett 
and O'Neill in recent years, and the occasional Off-Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
Seifter, 36, who came to the Magic in 1988 from New York's Theater for the New 
City and who expects to assume artistic direction of the company after Magic 
trustees meet next month, hopes to return the Magic's emphasis to new plays. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense that, in some ways, San Francisco has become cut off from the 
most exciting national currents," he said. "I know that in Los Angeles, (they) 
have a number of theaters that are pumping large amounts of money into new play 
development. If that doesn't happen here, it will become tremendously difficult 
to keep theater alive in the Bay Area." 
</P>
<P>
Lion said that after spending his adult life as director of the Magic, he had 
wearied of the work. The father of two young children, he said he wished to 
spend more time with his family and complete his doctoral thesis in theater at 
Stanford University. "I'm 45 now," he reflected. "One wonders how long one can 
be an iconoclastic young man." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1967, the Magic has produced some 200 plays, of which Lion directed 70. 
He hopes eventually to publish his thesis as a book. It deals with Shepard's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Departing as well is Simon Levy, who, as executive director of Theatre Bay 
Area, a theater service organization, catered to the interests of 152 member 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"The changing of the guard is healthy, really," he said. "The people who are 
leaving were all on the cutting edge in the 1970s. Now, maybe we'll have a New 
Wave in Bay Area theater." 
</P>
<P>
Across the San Francisco Bay, Mitzi Sales, managing director of the Berkeley 
Repertory, announced her resignation from the 22-year-old troupe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaving because I've had the same job for 18 years," she said. "It's time 
to try something new." No replacement has been named. 
</P>
<P>
Sales, who saw the Berkeley Rep's budget grow from $72,000 in 1972 to its 
present $3.6 million, said she had no plans other than to travel in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps there's something in the air. If Lithuania can hire a music teacher as 
prime minister, and Czechoslovakia elect a playwright for president, maybe it's 
time for all of us in the arts to make a change," she said, referring to 
Vytautas Landsbergis and Vaclav Havel, respectively. "Maybe we should all go to 
Lithuania and run for parliament."

OCTOBER QUAKE PROVES HARD ACT TO FOLLOW FOR S.F.'S ESTABLISHED ACT

Unveiling the American Conservatory Theater's 24th season last September, 
Edward Hastings, the company's artistic director, promised theatergoers that 
the coming months wouldn't "just startle and delight them . . . but shake and 
disorient them by the unexpected. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
When the unexpected took grim form in the Oct. 17 earthquake, Hastings' hopeful 
puffery became ironic prophecy. Left in rubble was ACT's home of 23 years, the 
ornate, octogenarian Geary Theater and left in doubt was the future of ACT 
itself, a once-proud company that only recently had begun to restore its 
reputation and recover an audience. 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, the company finds itself in the midst of what may prove to 
be a bruising period of self-examination. Architectural decisions that must be 
made today will affect the kind of plays that can be produced in a restored 
Geary far into the future, said ACT managing director John Sullivan. So before 
any restoration decisions are made, ACT has to determine what kind of theater 
company it wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings said he would schedule a series of what he calls 'thinky-feely" 
meetings, where, under the guidance of a $600-per-day professional 
"facilitator" the 300 company members will air their ambitions for ACT. 
</P>
<P>
"It's caused people here to go into spiritual lapses and re-examinations," Mike 
McShane, an ACT actor, said of the quake's impact. Less obliquely, as Sullivan 
put it, "the first issue is the survival of the company." The company 
immediately closed the then-running show (George Coates' "Right Mind"), and 
took the balance of the season on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had wildly different ideas" about the future, Hastings said. "The 
question is, how much into the avant-garde do we want to go? If you're 
primarily a classical company, what won't you do? 
</P>
<P>
"Some say we should leave the walls unfinished, so we can see the bones and 
muscle, and feel the strength. Others say we should get the lights and 
equipment hidden behind the gold cupids -- so it looks like the perfect theater 
of 1910. 
</P>
<P>
"Then," he continued, "there is one school of avant-garde theater that believes 
all actors' voices should be amplified, so directors can orchestrate the sound. 
And we've been told to build a hydraulic stage, like (the one) at CalArts north 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you start talking about that, you're talking about the orchestra pit, 
which brings up the subject of musicals. Do you want a company that does 
musical theater? And so on." The debate seems ready to pit younger company 
members, eager to use ACT's still-formidable resources for more experimental 
theater, against veterans who cherish the company's traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us want to go in a new direction, the one we've started with 'Twelfth 
Night,' " said actor McShane, a 34-year-old who's been with ACT four years. 
</P>
<P>
Under director John C. Fletcher, the Shakespeare comedy was cast in Day-Glo 
colors on a tropical isle. Performed at the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre near 
the Presidio, the production's inventive visual images and bouncy Caribbean 
score won great praise. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do this lofty, East Coast deconstruction of the Bard," said 
McShane. "We'd like to deconstruct him all right, but with a cream pie in his 
face. We should tear things up with a joyous frenzy." 
</P>
<P>
McShane wants ACT to take the same aggressive, irreverent appproach to other 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not take on American authors -- and tear them up? I mean, sure we'd all 
like to do 'Nicholas Nickleby,' but, hey, why not Jack London? How about some 
new young black playwrights in the Bay Area?" 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"These points are all well taken, but I don't think they're going to change the 
nature of ACT, or of the kind of theater ACT does," said actress Michael 
Learned, one of many company alumni who moved on to television and film. 
</P>
<P>
"How many theaters in the States do classics? I think there's a place for that 
here," said Learned, who was in San Francisco to appear in the current ACT 
production of Tom Stoppard's "Hapgood." 
</P>
<P>
Learned, best known as Olivia on TV's "The Waltons," asserts that "ultimately, 
what the theater is about is a great and philosophical question that we won't 
be able to answer here." 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the creative discussions is an economic reality: the need to gain 
more subscribers and contributors without putting off current ones. Eighty 
percent of present subscribers live in the suburbs outside San Francisco, 
Sullivan said, and many are senior citizens with conservative tastes. The kinds 
of plays they tend to like -- such as the recent "Judevine," a pastoral of 
small-town New England that received tepid notices -- fail to excite the 
younger, urban theatergoers. 
</P>
<P>
McShane argues that more adventuresome work would attract support. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking people who look at theater as something you just can't not go to. 
People who appreciate the new breaking-up of the language, modern verse, strong 
choral plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to develop these people for our audience," he said. "Otherwise, all 
our subscribers are getting older and sweeter and nicer -- and gradually (the 
subscription base) will decline into nothingness." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1967, ACT has been wedded to its performance space, a landmark structure 
near Union Square in downtown. Thanks to a 1975 Ford Foundation grant, ACT 
bought the Geary outright, and over the years has matched its repertory to the 
imposing classical style of its home. 
</P>
<P>
Standing as a symbol of ACT's strengths during difficult days in the early 
1980s -- a period of decline that ended, many believe, only with the ouster in 
1986 of the company's founder, William Ball -- the Geary now represents the 
huge financial and creative challenges the company faces in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-seat theater's facade survived the 7.1 temblor unscathed, but those 
walking inside found a spectacle to rival anything Andrew Lloyd Webber could 
cook up: the ornamental proscenium had collapsed in eerily dramatic fashion, 
dislodging the lighting grid as it fell and tumbling onto the stage and 
orchestra seats. Sinews of wire, banks of plaster and shreds of curtain 
stretched from ceiling to floor, presenting viewers with a four-story study in 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Structural damage riddled the building, forcing the closure of the then-running 
show and the eviction of costume and scene shops. Estimates put restoration of 
the Geary -- which was itself built to replace theaters destroyed in the 1906 
earthquake -- at $15 million, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Spared only was ACT's conservatory, which is housed along with company offices 
in rented space across Geary Street. 
</P>
<P>
Observers credit Hastings and his company with a resourceful response. Dubbing 
the balance of the season the "1990 World Tour," ACT arranged use of five other 
theaters in San Francisco, and redesigned its productions to fit them. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, said playwright Anthony Clarvoe, whose "Pick Up Ax" was then in a 
conservatory workshop, "they've done one really proud thing: They haven't laid 
anybody off." 
</P>
<P>
ACT's resilience came at a price, however: Continuing the season in rented 
space will cost $1 million both this year and next, Sullivan said. Even before 
the earthquake, the company was committed to raising one-fourth of its 
$10-million annual budget from donations and grants. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the emergency money will come from the region's Arts Recovery Fund, 
created by the National Endowment for the Arts to raise $2.2 million for Bay 
Area artists stricken by the quake. The fund, which has already distributed 
more than $1.4 million from firms and local governments in the Bay Area, has 
earmarked 40% of its proceeds to ACT's operating expenses. To help raise the 
balance, the California Arts Council recently undertook a statewide fundraising 
campaign that asks the public to contribute to the recovery fund. As of last 
week, $3,500 had been contributed. But solutions that might seem obvious to 
people in other cities -- such as selling ACT-owned property adjoining the 
theater to a developer -- are more problematic here. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had suggestions that we build a big building on top of the theater," 
Sullivan said, evoking methods that are used by high-rise developers in Los 
Angeles and New York. "But this is not a pro-development city. I think the 
political environment is not quite the same as in Los Angeles." Difficult as 
the financial problems are, they are compounded by the creative quandary that 
has long faced the company. Choosing the sort of plays that should be performed 
during ACT's enforced vagrancy and planning the new form of the Geary demands a 
clarity of vision that ACT has had difficulty articulating in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Ball, who founded ACT in 1965, conceived a repertory company that would combine 
its stage work with professional training for actors and directors. Under his 
early leadership, ACT emerged as the pre-eminent theatrical company in the Bay 
Area, and won a special Tony Award as an outstanding regional theater in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, however, Ball's management became strained and misdirected. Amid 
allegations of financial impropriety, the company ran up a $1.5 million 
deficit, and pared down its productions to odd, spare plays that alienated 
audiences and contributors. 
</P>
<P>
ACT trustees finally forced Ball's departure in 1986, replacing him with 
Hastings, also a founding member of the company. Measured and professorial, 
Hastings steered ACT back to some respectability, reducing the deficit and 
stressing competent productions of familiar plays. 
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of the 1989-90 season, officials said, the deficit had been 
cut to $320,000; subscriptions, which had fallen to 11,000 in 1986, stood at 
18,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, many in the theater community found the troupe's work uninspired. Some 
questioned whether San Francisco's leading theater company should be devoting 
itself to such community theater staples as "A Christmas Carol" and "A Funny 
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." 
</P>
<P>
With ACT forced into smaller theaters during its exile, actor McShane suggests 
more experimental works could be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings demurred. "We're not going to be able to take greater risks," he said. 
"As I'm envisioning it, we'll be in smaller theaters, but for longer runs, so 
the number of tickets remains the same." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the Geary goes, Hastings said, "it is one of those splendid old 
theaters that has a special relationship with the audience -- and with the 
play. I'm willing to listen to other ideas, but I think it is perfectly suited 
to classical plays."

A TINY FEE ($100 PER BAND) AND LOTS OF EXPOSURE; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY ROCK 'N' ROLL GROUPS GO DEEP INTO THE HEART OF TEXAS FOR A BIG 
WINGDING, AND FIND THE SCENE MORE TO THEIR LIKING

What a difference a few months make: 
</P>
<P>
The last time Orange County rock bands National People's Gang, Don't Mean Maybe 
and Eggplant played together, it was to a near-empty Coach House last December, 
where the lure of a charitable cause, a low ticket price and a lineup of most 
county acts of consequence wasn't sufficient to draw a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
But on March 16, the three bands, along with O.C.-scene cronies the Swamp 
Zombies performed to a packed, enthusiastic audience that was churning like a 
trout farm, giving back at least as much energy as the bands were putting out. 
</P>
<P>
That may seem like considerable progress in three months, but there's also the 
little matter of 1,400 miles between the two gigs. 
</P>
<P>
The four bands, all of whom record for Orange's Dr. Dream Records, and three 
other O.C.-bred acts -- Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts, the Wild Cards 
and Johnny Monster &amp; the Nightmares -- had hit the highway to the Texas 
capital to take part in the fourth annual South by Southwest Music and Media 
Conference, held March 15 through 18. 
</P>
<P>
Lest ever it be believed that musicians think like normal people, consider this 
deal: Most performers put in well over 24 hours of nonstop drive time each way, 
braving deserts, high winds and Texas cops; each played for less than an hour, 
spent a few hours in town, then headed out to make it back to their day jobs or 
to gigs on the road. They did this for a total of $100 per band, barely enough 
to meet a group's Snickers outlay on the road. 
</P>
<P>
And most of the Orange County musicians say they want to do it again next year. 
</P>
<P>
The rationale they might offer a spouse or an accountant for making such a trip 
is that the South by Southwest Conference is a chance for musicians -- 417 acts 
performed this year -- to be heard by some of the conference's 2,500 managers, 
club bookers, label heads, broadcasters, journalists and sundry folk connected 
with the business of getting original music heard. 
</P>
<P>
Modeled on New York's New Music Seminar, South by Southwest is devoted to 
alternative and independent music of all stripes -- from bluegrass to rap; any 
style that is largely ignored by the corporate media. Decidedly non-corporate 
-- SXSW, as it is more concisely referred to, opened with an invocation by 
Exene Cervenka and concluded with a softball tournament and barbecue -- the 
conference was host to dozens of workshops and panels, including a handful on 
accounting and contracts. But conference co-founder Louis Meyers maintains, 
"Because this is Austin, the music will always come first." 
</P>
<P>
The heart of SXSW is its four-night music festival, with hundreds of acts 
spread among 23 of Austin's typically jumping venues. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said the conference aimed to "move the bands a step up the ladder, 
regardless of what step they may be on. We try to get them heard by people who 
can make a difference in their careers. We don't make any ridiculous promise 
that a band is going to get signed, but I think we have helped promote the idea 
with them that their path is not so impossible any more, that there is a light 
at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
Most performers were chosen by panels of Austin music professionals, who pare 
the choices down from thousands of demo tapes and press kits. Some groups were 
chosen by regional publications that co-sponsor the event with the alternative 
weekly Austin Chronicle. The O.C.-based Pacific News and Review was one, and 
editor Randy Jay Matin selected the South County's Johnny Monster &amp; the 
Nightmares after seeing a frenetic, packed show locally. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-touring National People's Gang, which spent 9 1/2 months on the road 
last year, drove down from tour dates in Canada. Most of the other groups 
defrayed their expenses by playing gigs between the coast and Austin. Chris 
Gaffney, who estimates that it cost $1,300 to take his band to Austin, found he 
should have planned further ahead: "We thought we were going to line up gigs on 
the way here and back, but I think there was about 5,000 other bands with the 
same idea." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Dr. Dream's acts got to Austin under their own steam, the company 
spent about $5,000 establishing a label presence at SXSW, bringing six staffers 
out, hosting a party and creating a special seven-inch EP of the four acts for 
insertion into the registration packages of the participants. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not expecting to conduct much business there; most people are really 
going there to enjoy the music," company co-owner Dave Hansen said. "We're 
chiefly trying to get some exposure for the artists and raise the identity for 
both the artists and the label." 
</P>
<P>
With the participants spread between so many venues, there is no guarantee that 
influential industry persons will see any given show. 
</P>
<P>
But the event isn't exclusively for SXSW registrants. It's also open to anyone 
in Austin who has $10 to spend for a wristband that allows admission to all 
clubs. So even if no industry wand-holder sees a group, there is still the 
enticement of discerning, enthusiastic audiences in a city that thrives on 
music the way other cities feast on finance. In that respect, 1,400 miles may 
be the least of the distances separating Austin from Orange County.

Don't Mean Maybe drummer Jeff Fairbanks was astounded by the teeming throng 
moving from club to club on 6th Street, Austin's music row: "I was climbing up 
light poles with my camera to take pictures of the crowds to show back home 
because I knew people in Orange County wouldn't believe this. You really can't 
without seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
While Texas may have always produced fine music, it didn't always have such an 
official tolerance for it. A Rolling Stone cover story 22 years ago, entitled 
"The Dispossessed Men and Mothers of Texas," related how the repressive, 
anti-hippie atmosphere of the time had driven out virtually a whole generation 
of Texas musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Such music scene as there was had taken root at an unlikely spot: an Austin gas 
station. Owner Kenneth Threadgill had sung and played beside Jimmie Rodgers in 
the '30s and still liked a good strum in the '60s, when his service station 
became a place where musicians would meet and play. It was the first place that 
Janis Joplin performed, before she, too, escaped the state. (For the past 
decade, Threadgill's has been a thriving restaurant, with the motto: "A diner 
by day and a dive by five.") 
</P>
<P>
That exodus reversed in the '70s. According to Clifford Antone, whose Antone's 
easily is this globe's most respected blues venue, "It just happened. I guess 
it's magic, like the Chicago scene of the '50s or San Francisco in the late 
'60s. It became a mecca where all these musicians and young people moved to." 
</P>
<P>
By 1975, the newly opened Antone's had two house bands: the Fabulous 
Thunderbirds and the Cobras, which featured a young Stevie Ray Vaughan. The 
Soap Creek club was promoting Joe Ely, Delbert McClinton and other roots 
renegades, while the Armadillo World Headquarters was boosting Willie Nelson 
and a new strain of "outlaw" country music. 
</P>
<P>
With a music scene that now draws residents from all over, such as Hawaii's Poi 
Dog Pondering and Wisconsin's Timbuk3, Austin well may be home to the hottest 
music scene in the United States. And there are a variety of local and state 
commissions devoted to making it so, including the Austin Music Industry 
Commission, which recently loaned 6th Street's alternative-music Cannibal Club 
$7,500 to help it get started. 
</P>
<P>
"On the West Coast, music is more of an industry, it's a product," Antone said. 
"The language is different, so much more centered around money. Here, we never 
considered money when we got into this. There's a lot of people that really, 
really love music here and have sacrificed a lot over the years to make this 
scene happen, but that's just the spirit of Austin." 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARCH 15: On the kickoff evening of the conference, the Orange County-based 
Wild Cards (which nevertheless is listed as a Los Angeles band by its sponsor, 
Miller Beer) performed with other Miller-tapped bands in the brewer's showcase 
at the Austin Opera House. They drew a rave review in the Austin 
American-Statesman, which stated that the Wild Cards held the show's "winning 
hand," and that their "Responsibilidad" is "a tune so dance-happy and laden 
with hooks that it virtually defines what an up-tempo hit single should sound 
like in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Things weren't quite so beatific at the cavernous Ritz on 6th Street, where 
Johnny Monster &amp; the Nightmares' campy 'n' crude theatrics fell flat with 
the Austin crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Festooned in capes, furs and finery, and with local strippers hired to dance, 
clothed somewhat, in go-go cages behind them, the quartet's performance was 
part Alice Cooper, part Cramps and part Adam Ant, or as one audience member put 
it, "like a cross between loud and bad." 
</P>
<P>
Austinite Chelsea Taylor, 19 and the daughter of former Joe Ely sideman Jesse 
Taylor, saw the Nightmares' show and wasn't any happier for it, judging by the 
international "gag me" sign she made to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"They sucked," she opined. "Give me a break. Austin music is so much more 
wacky, so much more intense than this. . . . Everyone has already heard what 
they're playing so many times." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Brown, a writer for the Oklahoma Daily out of Norman, Okla., concurred: 
"It was just a sloth metal thing. It didn't have any verve. It's all been done 
before, like by Alice Cooper. I thought it was pretty boring." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Monster's manager, Berkeley Green, had his own explanation for the show 
response: "People out there (in Orange County) are a little more screaming mad, 
you know, more rambunctious. People seem more reserved here (in Austin)." 
</P>
<P>
The band had planned on spending the next night in Austin, but Green said they 
had done so well the night before in a Dallas club called the Video Bar that 
the manager had asked them back. Meanwhile, Austin's Thursday night went on in 
its reserved manner, the clubs packed and jumping until 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
MARCH 16: The next morning, National People's Gang consigliere Sam Lanni 
staggered into the lobby of the Hyatt, a lit cigarette providing perhaps the 
only flicker of life on his road-tired face. Lanni had just driven the band's 
RV all night from Lawrence, Kan., the last leg of the group's three-day, 
two-show, 1,960-mile jaunt to Austin from Saskatoon, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Differing, one presumes, from typical Hyatt conventioneers, many participants 
in the South by Southwest Conference could be found sleeping in their cars and 
vans in the Hyatt parking lot. NPG's RV was parked at an edge of the lot near 
Town Lake, a dammed portion of the river running through Austin. It was an 
idyllic spot for Lanni to rouse the band, since, as vocalist Chad Jasmine later 
explained, "Stepping out of that RV, there was really our first taste of 
spring. We went from some seriously cold weather to that Austin sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from a gig with Eggplant in Santa Fe, the Swamp Zombies also arrived that 
morning, their equipment hauled behind their station wagon in a trailer 
garishly painted with a vicious alligator and words proclaiming "Gamba, King of 
the Swamp," "16 Feet of Reptilian Terror." Guitarist Josh Agle noted, "We've 
never had a problem with break-ins." While the bands checked into Dr. 
Dream-provided rooms to grab some stationary rest before their gig that night, 
the Hyatt's halls buzzed with SXSW panels and workshops. There was a "Meet 
Philadelphia" workshop where insiders gave such roots-level pointers as which 
record stores would allow bands to play on their sidewalks. "And we've got 
killer cheese-steaks!" enthused one panelist. A similar "Meet London" panel 
gave hints on how bands could sneak their albums past British customs. 
</P>
<P>
In a hands-on workshop in the Hyatt parking lot, a local mechanic showed 
musicians and roadies how to repair their vans on the road. One of the larger 
panels featured legendary early-rock producers Cosimo Matassa, Huey P. Meaux 
and other musical mavericks. Though much of the independent music boosted by 
SXSW was far removed from their rootsy specialties, both were still excited 
about any music that railed at the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Meaux declared: "It would be a hell of a thing if every painter painted the 
same thing all the time, and they (major record labels) are making music like 
that now." Matassa commented on the difficulty that original music has always 
had getting media attention: "They say every dog has his day, but we all know 
there's more dogs than days." 
</P>
<P>
Following a pre-show barbecue (What in Austin isn't a barbecue?) reception held 
in their Hyatt suite, the Dr. Dream staff and bands headed for the Cannibal 
Club for their four-act showcase. Spray-painted on a wall behind the club was 
the graffito, "Nazis fight cuz they can't dance." On the sidewalks out front 
was the previous night's throng, multiplied by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Don't Mean Maybe's Jeff Fairbanks remarked: "I'd notice whole groups of 
people would filter into a place, and then if they liked it, they'd stay, and 
if they didn't, they'd filter out to another place. There's all that choice, 
and that's the way it should be. It was like free-market capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
That flow didn't work entirely in the Dr. Dreamers' favor: New York-based 
Reuters writer John Swenson liked some of the showcase. "But it isn't enough to 
keep me from wondering what's across the street," Swenson said, and off he 
went. 
</P>
<P>
There were others to take his place, though, and the club was packed nearly 
throughout the evening, due partly to National People's Gang and the Swamp 
Zombies' previous Austin appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Eggplant started the evening, bolstering its solid songwriting with 
instrumental excursions ranging from spacey post-psychedelicisms to the raucous 
country riffs of its "Eli Riddle." Don't Mean Maybe pummeled through its 
thicket of convoluted Beefheartian rhythms, and the goofus acoustic folk songs 
of the manic Swamp Zombies kept the crowd stirring. 
</P>
<P>
The audience response seemed largely positive, with Mike Clifford, a deejay 
from college station KRUX in Las Cruces, N.M., saying of Don't Mean Maybe: "I 
liked them a lot. They kind of reminded me of the old Minutemen. They really go 
at it. They have that punk energy, but they also have the weird time changes 
and all. I hadn't heard them before, but I'm real inclined to play them now." 
</P>
<P>
The highest praise for the Zombies, perhaps, came from Vito Savino, a 
mechanical engineer from Lake Hiawatha, who said: "Most of the bands I've seen 
tonight are pretty different, but this one is more different." 
</P>
<P>
And of Eggplant, Austin Chronicle writer Luke Torn said in the March 23 issue 
that it was "the weekend's most unexpected surprise," citing its "intrepid 
guitar signatures" in a sparkling set that ended all too soon." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise for this writer, though, was National People's Gang's set. 
Where I had always thought its home-turf gigs to be cluttered with artsy 
pretentions, its Cannibal Club set was pure electricity. Chad Jasmine's 
theatrics, including tearing oranges up to toss slices to the audience and 
soliciting audience dollars, which he also tore up, heightened the communal 
feeling of the performance. Most of that rapport, though, was the result of a 
taut musicianship and a boundingly kinetic performance that had the audience 
churning throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's Christina DeGaitis, who works for the Rykodisc label, shouted 
her enthusiasm over the club noise: "Compared to the other stuff I've seen down 
here, they had 50 times the energy. I mean, they had the whole crowd going, and 
how many of these people had ever even heard of them before? I hadn't. But they 
have what the Red Hot Chili Peppers have in terms of turning a crowd on." 
</P>
<P>
In print, Austin American-Statesman writer Michael MacCambridge cited Jasmine's 
"over-the-top theatricality" and guitarist Chad Forrello's "state-of-the-art 
L.A. art-rock Angst" in his noncommittal review. He also noted Jasmine's 
chucking of oranges into the crowd: "The band's recent release was 'Orange'; 
good thing they didn't call it 'Pineapple.' " 
</P>
<P>
Chronicle critic Joseph P. Mitchell, meanwhile, claimed that the set "left me 
mesmerized. . . . The lead singer was enthralling. Most of the songs dealing 
with politics, populism and a new non-materialistic consciousness were 
accompanied by his gripping dramatic gestures." 
</P>
<P>
Singer Jasmine felt pretty good about the show himself. "Something has really 
jelled on this tour," which has been going since February. "I feel there was a 
lot of magic going on. It's becoming more real, where there's not a big 
separation between the act and the people seeing it. Every time we play live, 
we try to forget about tomorrow, and let loose what we have to offer and make 
friends." Judging from the showcase success, Dr. Dream's Hansen thinks: "We 
have a real foothold in Austin now, where we can send any of our acts here an 
they'll take a chance with them. And for us, it's such a boost. Either on the 
road or working the phone, you're up against so many 'no's' that one little 
breakthrough like this can make all the difference in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Eggplant's Jon Melkerson said he was encouraged to see so many other 
independent bands at work, in that "I don't want to sound big-headed, but of 
all the alternative bands I saw, there was nothing that seemed that far ahead 
of us. It made me stoked that we're not so out of step." 
</P>
<P>
Said Fairbanks: "When you play for a lot of people in a town where there's so 
much stuff going on, it makes you feel you're doing something a little more 
legitimate. I feel that way in most towns we play outside of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Of the piles of demo tapes he listened to, SXSW's Meyers said, "Chris Gaffney's 
was one of my favorite tapes that came in this year. I tried to push a lot of 
people out to see that show." He evidently succeeded, as Gaffney's Saturday 
night set at the Hole in the Wall was as packed as a fire marshal's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney isn't the first singer to carry Orange country to Texas -- expatriate 
countian and Jerry Jeff Walker cohort Chris Wall now even smiles down from 
Austin billboards -- but it's still a fairly audacious thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Unless one does it as well as Gaffney. The Costa Mesan works in a boatyard by 
day, but he's been playing country for the last 20 of his 39 years. At the Hole 
in the Wall, he and his five-piece Cold Hard Facts authoritatively mixed hard 
honky-tonkin' with zydeco and Tex-Mex flourishes. It hit with a directness that 
had the crowd demanding an encore, a rarity at the tightly scheduled fest. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen at the club, Gaffney was holding his accordion over his head, 
trying to squeeze through the well-wishers blocking his way. Later, he was to 
remark, "We haven't been adored like that in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
That to find such a lively scene the Orange County bands had to leave one of 
the most affluent population centers in the nation and go to a town surrounded 
by hundreds of miles of Texas dirt and scrub oak is an irony that wasn't lost 
on the participants. 
</P>
<P>
Reached a few days after SXSW, in Athens, Ga., where an ecstatic club owner had 
just held NPG over for a second night, Jasmine said: "Orange County is a great 
place. We all live there and think of it as home, and I think we do really well 
there. But going around playing lots of places and meeting people all over 
North America, I do think we've done a lot of growing up. That might never 
happen when you sit in one place and try to bang your head against that Orange 
County door. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are a lot of people there who want things to happen, but as far 
as city councils and city governments and their stranglehold on everything, 
there's too many damn regulations. There's such a conservative thing going on 
that it's completely taking away from the artistic thing. And you go to Newport 
Beach, and even the young kids with skateboards are so unaware. I hate to make 
that generalization, but nobody's ever shown them what can be. 
</P>
<P>
"They live in Orange County and they don't understand the steps of how to make 
things happen. It seems like Austin has a completely different feeling. When 
people look at each other, they smile, and there's an overall goodness going on 
that makes us all feel really good. Every time we've been there, it's been 
great." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dream's Hansen said: "I don't know how serious it was, but we were talking 
a lot about how we should relocate down there. Aside from the great music scene 
there, it makes a lot of sense money-wise because you can do things a lot 
cheaper there. Here, it's just a struggle to do anything. So many people don't 
give the music a chance, and I don't know how you conquer that." 
</P>
<P>
Eggplant's Melkerson and the Swamp Zombies' Agle are both glad for the audience 
and support that Orange County has given them, though Agle noted, "Audiences 
usually are more responsive on the road," and Melkerson said, "It's never going 
to be like Austin here." 
</P>
<P>
Like Jasmine, Don't Mean Maybe's Fairbanks chalks the difference up to an 
overabundance of government control, pointing out how Safari Sam's, the 
county's last full-time venue supporting local music, was closed by the city of 
Huntington Beach four years ago. "In Austin, it's like there's 25 Safari 
Sam's." 
</P>
<P>
When NPG manager Lanni, who had owned Safari Sam's, was asked how to best 
change Orange County for the better, he suggested, "with a bulldozer." 
</P>
<P>
"Even to have five Safari Sam's on one block," he said, "which would be only 
one-tenth of what is going on in Austin, is pretty near impossible to imagine 
happening in this county. It would be like them declaring democracy in China 
tomorrow. This is the bedroom community of the country right here. People want 
to go to sleep. They want strip-mall shopping centers." 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney was back playing in a Costa Mesa bar three nights, one windstorm and an 
interminable Texas Highway Patrol vehicle search ("I was 39 then; I'm 41 now") 
after his Austin show. The small crowd was chiefly busy shooting billiards and 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
As he talked during a break, the Austin show was still clearly on Gaffney's 
mind. "It was really great. It seemed like everybody in the world was there. We 
haven't really been accepted that much here." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he perceived the difference between O.C. and Austin, Gaffney referred 
to one far-gone woman who had tumbled onto the dance floor during his set: "Did 
you just see that girl fall on the ground? During a ballad, for goodness's 
sake? That's the difference right there. I think they stay standing in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
Back behind the microphone, Gaffney grappled with the old Animals' standard "We 
Gotta Get Out of This Place." If there was more than a hint of desperate 
determination in the way he howled out its lyric, no one took any particular 
notice.

COFFIN-BEARERS STAGE DEATH PENALTY PROTEST IN S.F. 
</P>

"Not in California" proclaimed the signs on 121 cardboard coffins that 
stretched a quarter of a mile across the Golden Gate Bridge during a mock 
funeral procession Saturday to protest the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people took part in the three-mile protest march from the San 
Francisco side of the bay to Vista Point in Marin County, just a few miles from 
the gas chamber at San Quentin prison. 
</P>
<P>
The march initially was scheduled as a protest of Tuesday's planned execution 
of Robert Alton Harris, which on Friday was blocked indefinitely by a federal 
appeals court judge. March organizers said they were heartened by the stay, but 
decided to go ahead with their protest. They noted that the state wants the 
U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the stay, perhaps in time to proceed with 
Tuesday's execution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a myth to think that killing anyone will make our nation any safer," 
declared activist entertainer Joan Baez in a brief speech before the protesters 
trekked across the bridge in single file. "I'm interested in creating a kinder, 
gentler nation." 
</P>
<P>
The 121 coffins, draped in black, symbolized the number of executions in the 
nation since a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court decision allowed states to reinstate 
capital punishment. Harris would have been the first executed in California in 
23 years if the federal judge had not blocked Tuesday's execution. 
</P>
<P>
The orderly march, sponsored by a coalition of religious and civil rights 
groups, caused traffic on the bridge to back up for two miles in each direction 
as curious motorists paused to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the demonstrators wore black and carried red carnations. Several 
carried signs with such messages as "Execute justice, not people" and "Why do 
we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Some motorists shouted obscenities in angry disagreement with the marchers. 
Others honked approval and flashed "thumbs up" signs of encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not excited about carrying a coffin and wearing black," said marcher Signe 
Boyer, a Bay Area music teacher. "But I feel strongly. If this is the way to 
take a stand against death, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Mac Nishikida, trying out his new fishing pole at the bay' edge Saturday 
morning, was among a number of local residents who found themselves in the path 
of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
"The protesters are going against the people's choice of California," which 
favors the death penalty, he said, folding up his rod. "The vote is in. It's a 
problem of a minority trying to take over the overwhelming view of the 
majority." 
</P>

NEW TRASH CZAR SAYS THE FUTURE IS NOW FOR SOLID-WASTE SOLUTION

<P>
Frank R. Bowerman -- Orange County's new trash czar -- remembers when hogs ate 
most of the public'sgarbage and back-yard incinerators were as common as 
barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
Bowerman, who started out as a Los Angeles County engineer for the sanitation 
department in 1948, remembers how trichinosis outbreaks brought an end to 
feeding pigs raw garbage (they wouldn't eat it cooked). And how a few years 
later, homemade "ash cans" were outlawed when experts realized that they solved 
one problem by adding to another -- air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the 67-year-old former college professor, who once gave Hollywood his 
technical advice for a science-fiction film, is about to become the first 
director of the county's Integrated Waste Management Department. On Tuesday, 
the Board of Supervisors is expected to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
Bowerman sees the problem of getting rid of solid waste as being closely 
related to other pressing environmental issues -- like air and water pollution 
and the deterioration of the ozone layer. He said solutions to the problems 
have to be sought now and not "when we're against the wall." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't allow ourselves to be backed into a corner, it's too dangerous," 
Bowerman said. "If you could visualize the confusion that would result in an 
urban area if there was no place to take its waste, it would be an impossible 
situation. We just can't allow it to happen. It would be like shutting off the 
water or food supply to a city. It is an absolute." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Bowerman said, he gained a special sensitivity toward 
problems facing the environment when he served as a technical adviser to writer 
Stanley R. Greenberg and actor Charlton Heston for the science-fiction movie 
"Soylent Green." 
</P>
<P>
His job was to give the filmmakers "a correct prediction of what things would 
be like in New York City in 2022." The futuristic yarn supposed that the 
21st-Century nation would be overpopulated and rapidly outpacing its ability to 
produce food. In the plot, national leaders, attempting to deal with the 
dwindling food supply, introduce a new synthetic food called "soylent green." 
But the new food, it turns out, is made from human corpses -- older people who 
are enticed into death in exchange for being able to see movies about how the 
Earth looked before being ravaged by man. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess working on the movie gave me a sense of focus about the environment 
and the serious threats that lurked out there," Bowerman said, adding that an 
underlying theme of euthanasia in the movie made him think seriously about 
overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Orange County, Bowerman spent 18 years with Los Angeles County 
government, then worked as a private consultant and later as a professor -- he 
holds an engineering degree -- and department head at USC. He joined range 
County's General Services Agency in 1983 as the director of the solid-waste 
program. 
</P>
<P>
When supervisors voted to take the program out of General Services and make it 
an independent department last month, Bowerman was named acting director of the 
new Integrated Waste Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very fortunate to get Frank in the early 1980s," said R. A. (Bert) 
Scott, director of General Services. "He not only made a contribution with the 
best available technology, he also has a depth of understanding on how to deal 
with staff." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez praised Bowerman for his "credentials that command 
respect" not only in the county and state but throughout the country. "He has 
brought the county's solid waste program through a successful transition," 
Vasquez said. He noted that when Bowerman joined the solid-waste program in 
1983, it had a budget of $10 million -- now its budget is $120 million and its 
staff about 290 employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't live in Orange County any longer," said Charles Carry, chief engineer 
and general manager of the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts. "But if I 
still did I would feel very comfortable with Frank Bowerman heading up the 
solid-waste program." 
</P>
<P>
Carry, who worked for Bowerman in the early and mid-1960s in Los Angeles, said 
he was a man ahead of his time. "We were dealing with the basic designs (of 
trash disposal systems) and Frank would be looking at odor control -- how 20 
years down the road we could button up the plant and not worry about odors." 
</P>
<P>
As Orange County's population moves toward the 2.5-million mark, trash has 
become big business. It is an expensive business too. Under the leadership of 
Bowerman, the county just opened its new $50-million, high-tech Bee Canyon 
landfill that officials hope will serve the disposal needs for parts of the 
county for the next 30 years. Trash disposal costs have jumped from $6 a ton 
seven years ago to $13.75 today. Experts figure the cost could hit $30 a ton by 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, Orange County residents and businesses generate 17,000 tons of trash. 
This averages out to just less than 11 pounds for every resident in the county, 
while businesses contribute the reminder of the tonnage. The county's four 
landfills daily receive enough trash to fill nearly five giant garbage barges 
like the one from Islip, N.Y., that traveled 6,000 miles searching for a 
disposal port in 1987, finally docking in Brooklyn after being turned away by 
five states and three countries. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is better off than most places when it comes to available 
landfills. Bowerman said Prima Deshecha landfill in South County has a 30-year 
life, while Santiago landfill near Orange is good for another decade, maybe 
more with increased recycling. When the new Bee Canyon opened up in early 
March, the old Coyote Canyon dump near Newport Beach closed. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants are now studying ways of extending the life of Olinda Landfill near 
Brea in North Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But Bowerman is optimistic that a new state law will extend the lives of all 
four landfills in the county. The law requires all cities and counties to 
divert 25% of their waste from landfills by 1995 and 50% by 2000. Officials 
hope to meet the goals by reducing the sources of refuse, increasing recycling, 
and enacting new programs to reuse yard wastes and old tires. Under the law, 
fines and penalties can be imposed on areas not meeting the requirements.

Four-year-old Dusty Hollar scampered around the green grass and trees of W.O. 
Hart Park Saturday, nearly stepping on the pastel Easter eggs in clumps of 
grass he was supposed to be finding. Both of his parents stood nearby shouting 
directions while other kids vied for the hidden eggs. 
</P>
<P>
It had been four years since Dusty saw his father outside of prison. The 
youngster was 7 months old when his dad was locked up in state prison. His 
father was released three days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dusty was unique among the 100 children who came to a barbecue staged for the 
families of imprisoned criminals. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the other kids, dad was still in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County chapter of Friends Outside threw the party Saturday as one of 
its several activities to help ease the loneliness and ostracism felt by 
immediate relatives of prison inmates, who often suffer repercussions from a 
crime they didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
"Families of incarcerated people are people who are forgotten," said Mary 
Waggoner, program coordinator for the Orange County chapter of Friends Outside. 
"They go through a lot of suffering. When someone is incarcerated, it's very 
devastating emotionally" for the family. 
</P>
<P>
Many are wives. Their husbands' imprisonment comes with a shock. Never mind the 
crime. Jobs have to be found. Bills have to be paid. Housing has to be found. 
Parental responsibilities double. And they have to learn how to live without 
the person they love. 
</P>
<P>
Financial troubles are common. Working on their own to provide for the family, 
these women don't have much opportunity to spend time with their children -- 
much less take them on a weekend outing. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday provided them the opportunity. In addition to the egg hunt, children 
ate candy, pulled strenuously on a rope in a tug-of-war, frolicked with someone 
in an Easter bunny suit and lobbed water-filled balloons in a tossing contest 
that quickly escalated to an all-out water war. 
</P>
<P>
The Easter event was designed so that the children "can still experience joy," 
said Waggoner. 
</P>
<P>
"At least they're coming together with people in the same situation they are. 
It's not like they're singled out anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Added Debbie Anderson, 29: "These types of things make it a little bit easier 
to handle a parent's incarceration. . . . It gives the kids something to look 
forward to -- a special event." 
</P>
<P>
Dusty's dad, 37-year-old Tony Hollar, agreed. He said kids enjoy Friends 
Outside activities because they do not have to worry about being teased or 
embarrassed by playground friends who ask questions about an imprisoned parent. 
</P>
<P>
The organization is especially concerned about the children, Waggoner said, 
because "beginning with them, we can break the perpetual flow of incarceration. 
It's proven that youths of incarcerated people are the most likely to become 
incarcerated themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Friends Outside also holds a celebration around Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Holidays are rough," said Inez Fox, 35, whose husband has been in and out of 
prison since 1983, leaving her alone to raise their three children. She said 
the loneliness intensifies during tradition-filled days such as Christmas and 
Easter because other families come together. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to throwing yearly barbecues, Friends Outside helps locate housing 
and offers discount bus tickets for prison visits, vouchers for thrift shop 
clothes, job referrals, summer "camperships" for children, holiday programs and 
support groups for women to share their common problems. 
</P>
<P>
Fox remembered the help she received from Friends Outside. The group referred 
her to a woman who drove her to prison twice weekly in 1983 so she could visit 
her husband. The woman provided a ride even on Christmas Day, dropping off a 
Christmas tree for Fox's family. 
</P>
<P>
Friends Outside has headquarters in San Jose and 16 chapters in California. 
</P>
<P>
A nondenominational organization, Friends Outside was first founded as "Rock 
Pile Widows" in 1954 by a Santa Clara Quaker, Rosemary Goodenough. 
</P>
<P>
Goodenough, an advocate for the poor, who died in 1973, was known for her pithy 
aphorisms such as "The people who get into jail have less experience with human 
kindness than anybody else." And "We deal in friendship built on mutual 
admiration, and that doesn't exist when one emotion is pity and the other is 
envy." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Newport Beach residents Bernice Ranford and Mary Dennigan organized a 
local chapter of volunteers and won financial support from the St. Vincent de 
Paul Society, a Catholic lay ministry for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The organization has 30 volunteers, and one jail visitor. 
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to 1989, the group helped 350 family members, 400 inmates and 700 
ex-offenders. More volunteers, both men and women, are needed, coordinator 
Waggoner said. 
</P>
<P>
When her husband was jailed by the Air Force on drug charges, Waggoner was left 
alone with a year-old daughter and no job skills. "It was like a death," she 
recalled. "But worse." 
</P>
<P>
She knew she had to start over financially and emotionally. But she also had to 
prepare for his eventual release from the Kansas prison where he had been sent. 
And because of appeals and retrials, nothing was certain. 
</P>
<P>
She found comfort, and eventually the only paid position, with the Orange 
County chapter of Friends Outside. 
</P>
<P>
Waggoner's husband was released last June after five years in prison. Although 
they telephoned and wrote letters regularly, she could afford to visit only 
once a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was shaky at first" between the two of them, she said. "We had to get used 
to each other." 
</P>
<P>
But with her 6-year-old daughter, she said, "It was really strange. It was as 
if he had never left."

SUPERVISORS SLOW TO BACK A REVAMPED MEASURE M; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: BOARD MEMBERS ARE RELUCTANT TO LEAD THE FIGHT FOR A LEVY TO FUND 
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS. SOME SAY VOTERS FACE ENOUGH TAX ISSUES ALREADY.

As Orange County supporters of a transportation sales tax press for a November 
vote on it, many of their key players are looking to the Board of Supervisors 
to take the lead. But several supervisors, mindful of political risks, have 
indicated that they will tread carefully on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I'll necessarily be leading the charge for it," Board 
Chairman Don R. Roth said. "I don't think that would be a very good idea." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said that several tax issues will soon come before Orange County voters 
and that he is worried about the potential for backlash as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he too is reluctant to lead support, at least 
until he learns more about the proposed measure. 
</P>
<P>
Only Supervisor Thomas F. Riley indicated that he might push the measure 
aggressively, but he is up for reelection in June and may wait until after that 
to play an active role. 
</P>
<P>
The other two supervisors, Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder, are 
considered less pivotal to the measure's success. "I view my role in this 
transportation financing issue as that of a facilitator of information and the 
election process, rather than as an advocate of one position or the other," 
Wieder said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
With supervisors sticking to the sidelines, at least for now, supporters of the 
transportation tax are worried that elected officials will leave a leadership 
vacuum on the issue. That prospect could threaten the proposal's passage, they 
said, especially if developers try to fill the gap by leading the effort 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"For this to pass, I think Gaddi Vasquez or Don Roth needs to get out front on 
it," said John R. Simon, a Newport Beach lawyer who represents developers and 
who was one of the forces behind Measure M, the half-cent transportation 
sales-tax proposal that failed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, who later added that Riley would also make an effective spokesman for a 
transportation measure, said the supervisors need to take the lead or voters 
will view the proposal suspiciously. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they really have to do it, or else we're going to be left with 
developers pushing the thing again," he said. "That could create some 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Simon and other Measure M proponents -- including the Orange County 
Transportation Commission -- hope to see a nearly identical proposal go before 
county voters this November, when they believe a higher turnout will propel it 
to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the commission unanimously directed its staff to go ahead with plans 
for putting a new measure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the prospects are excellent for a Measure M rematch in November," 
commission member and Measure M supporter Dana W. Reed said Monday, after the 
commission's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Although adding that he believes a revamped Measure M would win regardless of 
whether the supervisors come to its aid, Reed said: "To win, I think it would 
be helpful for the supervisors to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
The measure's supporters were stunned by its failure last year, and analysts 
have attributed it to a combination of low voter turnout and its negative 
association with developers, who contributed the bulk of the campaign's war 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's true that the heavy leadership of the developers backfired," 
Riley said. "I think that's too bad because we need to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Having the supervisors take the lead this time would help overcome the 
measure's association with the development community and thus ease voters' 
concerns, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
In the search for leadership, most attention has centered on Vasquez, Roth and 
Riley, who are considered the most powerful and popular members of the 
five-member board. Supervisor Stanton has not shown great interest in the 
transportation measure, supporters say, and Wieder, who lost a bid for a 
congressional seat in 1988, is struggling with her own political future. 
</P>
<P>
For the remaining three board members, however, supporting the measure involves 
significant political risks. Proponents could be linked with development 
interests, and even if they are not, they will be in a position of asking 
voters to increase their own taxes. 
</P>
<P>
That's a risk, the supervisors acknowledged, though Riley said he would be 
willing to take it once the June election is past. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to ask the supervisors to put this (transportation measure) on 
the ballot," Riley said. "I don't think we'd take that action until July or 
August, but I think the supervisors would support it." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Vasquez, who does not face reelection for two years, 
was more cautious. He said he would decline to lead the push for Measure M, at 
least for now, but that his reluctance was based on a desire to review the 
proposal, not on politics surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
"First, we would need to have the kind of a plan . . . that provides something 
for everybody," Vasquez said. "It would have to provide for the diversity of 
cities that we have, it would have to establish a level of accountability and 
it should include a growth-management component." 
</P>
<P>
And looming over the debate is Orange County's persistent and famous refusal to 
endorse new taxes, regardless of the program they are intended to support. 
</P>
<P>
Californians will be asked to consider a statewide hike in the gas tax on an 
upcoming ballot, and local officials have debated higher sales taxes to pay for 
new jails and court facilities. Altogether, supervisors are worried that their 
constituents will react by simply voting down any tax that comes their way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried that we're on a collision course of raising all these taxes at the 
same time," Roth said. "That's not going to be easy."

TRAVELERS COUNT TOO AS CENSUS GOES TO CAMP; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOGRAPHICS: WORKERS FROM THE SANTA ANA BUREAU CANVASS THE CENTRAL COUNTY FOR 
UNTALLIED TOURISTS.

Dan and Edna Barnes travel around the country in their 3-year-old silver camper 
for about six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
They enjoy constantly moving, but the retired Illinois couple ran the danger 
this year of going uncounted because they were away from home when their census 
form arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Census Bureau foresaw that. 
</P>
<P>
The Barneses were among vacationers and travelers counted by more than two 
dozen census workers who roamed eight recreational vehicle and mobile home lots 
in central Orange County on Saturday evening -- hours before the dawn of 
official Census Day. The effort by the bureau's Santa Ana office was part of 
the statewide "T-day" -- Transient Day -- count Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the deadline for people who received census forms to return them by 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea for them to come to us," Dan Barnes said, sitting in 
his camper parked in an RV lot in Anaheim. "We knew the count was going on with 
all the advertising and whatnot. But we've been on the road for about the last 
month and didn't get the form." 
</P>
<P>
Census workers said that although T-Day also was held in 1980, this year's 
effort was much more advanced. 
</P>
<P>
"We put much more emphasis on making sure we find these people," said Fernando 
Tafoyo, district manager. "With the increasing popularity of mobile home parks 
with short-term leases and campers, many Americans are moving around a great 
deal. And because areas like Anaheim have Disneyland and other attractions, you 
get a lot of extra people who might have been on the road for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from campgrounds and mobile home parks, the census workers also surveyed 
YMCAs and YWCAs that rent rooms on a short-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
"California is unique in that here the YMCA and YWCA rent to more people on 
long-term periods than short-term," said Frank Fletcher, crew leader. "That 
made it difficult because we didn't want to recount the same people that were 
counted on homeless night." Census workers recently attempted to count the 
homeless by going to shelters and other gathering places. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid counting people Saturday who might have already returned their census 
forms, workers asked the travelers if they have permanent homes and, if so, 
told them to mark a certain box on the form. The computer automatically throws 
out two forms from the same address. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher added that most of the time, people who move from spot to spot are not 
homeless or poor, just mobile. 
</P>
<P>
"These people, for the most part, have resources unavailable to the majority of 
the homeless," Fletcher said. "Today more people are just seeming to travel 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd and Dorthy Jones said they, too, would have been missed in the count if 
the census workers hadn't come to them. They live in a RV with their three 
children and move from one trailer park to another every month or so, while 
they save enough money to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a permanent address for about a year now," Dorthy Jones said 
from her camper, now parked in Anaheim, "so we knew they probably couldn't find 
us to send a form. And I've been so busy I didn't think much about trying to 
get one sent to us. But I know it's important because it means better schools." 
</P>
<P>
Census officials said that determining how many people might occupy a 
particular spot is the toughest part of estimating the count.

7 UCI STUDENTS HELD AT NEVADA NUCLEAR TEST RANGE; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE: THE DEMONSTRATORS JOIN A FIVE-DAY DECADE TO DISARM PROTEST

<P>
Seven UC Irvine students were among the first anti-nuclear activists who were 
arrested Saturday during a daylong protest at a federal underground nuclear 
testing range. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen UCI students and alumni were among about 1,500 protesters at the 
Nevada Test Site, 68 miles northwest of Las Vegas. By late Saturday, nearly 600 
protesters had been arrested, with dozens more waiting to be processed. 
</P>
<P>
As they stepped onto test site property, the seven UCI students were met by Nye 
County sheriff's deputies, who smiled and chatted with them. The students 
handed the officers handmade toy missiles, which were used in a mock theater 
presentation staged just before their arrests to protest the University of 
California's participation in nuclear weapons research at laboratories in 
Livermore and Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were participating in a five-day Decade to Disarm protest, 
sponsored by three peace groups: American Peace Test, the Western Shoshone 
Council and a Soviet anti-nuclear group called the Nevada Movement. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Highway Patrol Capt. Glenn Jewett said most of the arrests occurred when 
the demonstrators crossed a cattle grate at the main Mercury entrance and 
stepped onto the federal property that includes the nation's top-secret nuclear 
testing grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that some students take the step and cross that line," said 
Jessica James, a first-year music and biology student who was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"Being from UCI, we have a specific aim in opposing the connection that (UC) 
has with nuclear weapons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrested UCI students were taken to a holding pen. Authorities said they 
would be cited for trespassing and released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested were: Joetta Moon, 25, a UCI graduate; Jeff Rouder, 23, a 
graduate student in anthropology; Caephren McKenna, 20, a political science and 
psychology major; Stephanie Lasko, 19, a drama major; Kate Sullivan, 19, a 
sophomore undeclared major, and Bob Harrison, 19, a freshman English major. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before being arrested, the students donned mortarboards fashioned from 
black construction paper. On their backs, they hung signs noting their class 
year. They then lined up, blindfolded themselves with white streamers and began 
humming a loud rendition of "Pomp and Circumstance," the graduation theme. 
</P>
<P>
Each student handed play money to a fellow student, who wore a sign designating 
her to be a UC representative. The students then accepted "diplomas" -- in the 
shape of miniature missiles, covered with aluminum foil and tied with a red 
ribbon. They then read statements condemning UC involvement in nuclear 
research. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation was meant to symbolize that students blindly hand over money 
to the UC system without questioning how it is being used, said Wendy Doetkott, 
23, a UCI senior and a protest organizer. 
</P>
<P>
"A few of us have thought we'd come to the university's graduation and repeat 
the same ceremony," said Joetta Moon, 25, a UCI graduate. "That's still being 
discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities promised to return the mock missiles to the students after they are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The action began Thursday and was timed to coincide with last week's deployment 
of the Trident II missile from Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in southern 
Georgia, organizers said. The Trident II is the Navy's most powerful nuclear 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations were held this weekend in Great Britain, West Germany 
and the Soviet Union, American Peace Test spokeswoman Katherin Dress said. 
</P>
<P>
Highway Patrol spokesman Jewett said Saturday's action was peaceful. "It's a 
good crowd," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, protesters closed the access road at the Mercury entrance for more 
than five hours when they blocked the highway, then built a rock wall across 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Highway Patrol trooper Phillip Dart said the highway had been closed for about 
five hours when Department of Transportation workers were called at 5 p.m. to 
remove the rocks. The road was expected to be cleared early Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The student action was part of a demonstration that has taken place annually at 
the test site for several years. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's crowd appeared to be smaller than in previous years, when 
protesters numbered about 8,000, Dart said. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of Saturday's crowd linked arms and skirted the perimeter of the 
site, creating a colorful band against the bleak, brown desert property. 
</P>
<P>
Some carried flags and banners. Others carried water and beat small snare 
drums, giving the otherwise-cheerful crowd a solemn tone. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those who set up camp about a mile from the main entrance of the site 
were college students, including contingents from UC Santa Cruz and UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Several high schools, including Brentwood High School in Los Angeles County, 
were also represented. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Valleo, 18, a student at Brentwood, said a recent visit to the Soviet 
Union convinced him that the U.S.S.R is as interested in peace as the United 
States is. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason to kill millions of people when we could be saving 
them," he said. "We all want peace." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine students said they hope the demonstration and their arrests will 
inform other students of UC nuclear activities and pressure the governing body 
of the system, the Board of Regents, to cut ties with the Department of Energy 
and the Department of Defense that involve nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Irvine Academic Senate is expected to take up the issue this spring. 
Similar discussions are taking place at other UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
In the heart of conservative Orange County, it is often tough to be an activist 
at UCI, said the students who camped out on the stretch of desert, but they 
found the company of the fellow protesters reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
"At Irvine, you can feel so alone," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
But the students said such protests show that their activism is changing. From 
beside a large tent decorated with a U.S. flag emblazoned with a peace symbol, 
UCI students such as Doetkott said the emphasis on nonviolence in protests is 
the biggest change. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see the kind of atrocities that occurred" in the 1960s, she said, 
noting that both police and protesters are educated now in civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
The police "treat us a lot better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, the students said, is that UCI activists are more organized 
than ever. They use the word networking, have newsletters and have a core group 
that acts as an umbrella organization for their causes. 
</P>
<P>
Several students protesting Saturday have also demonstrated for gay rights at 
UCI and have demanded more participation in student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're dealing with is serious," McKenna said. "We're dealing with the 
future." 
</P>

ON-CAMPUS SUSPENSION PROGRAM THROWS THE BOOKS AT GOOF-OFFS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John, a 13-year-old student at Buena Park Junior High, wasn't very upset when 
he was suspended for one day last year after being rude to the secretaries in 
the front office. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension meant a day alone at home for the seventh-grader, playing 
Nintendo video games, eating what he wanted and listening to the radio. 
</P>
<P>
This year, his punishment for a similar offense was not so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
Under the school's new program for suspensions, John spent the day doing 
schoolwork in a windowless room the size of a walk-in closet. 
</P>
<P>
To discourage students from watching the clock, the time has been permanently 
set at 6 o'clock. A Code of Conduct sign hangs on the wall. Lunchroom 
privileges are taken away, and the students are accompanied everywhere -- even 
to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Under the watchful eye of a school employee, John made his way through a thick 
stack of assignments and pledged to stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part about it is that I can't talk," John said. "I am just sitting 
here in a chair and facing the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Since Buena Park Junior High started the program in September, suspensions have 
dropped by 50%, from 80 to 40, said Assistant Principal Steve Johnson. And by 
keeping students on campus instead of sending them home, the school can 
maintain its average daily attendance -- the crucial figure that determines how 
much money each school receives from the state. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, at least eight Orange County school districts have 
started in-house suspension programs, and several others are considering the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of suspending students to be out on the street, it is something more 
constructive," said Mitch Thomas, principal of Los Amigos High School in 
Fountain Valley, which started a program this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program varies slightly among the districts, most schools set 
aside a special room on campus for suspended students. A teacher's aide or 
substitute teacher is hired to oversee the students. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster School District has modified its program this year to include 
counselor Pamela Kehl. After having a program based on punitive measures for 
several years, Kehl said, the district decided to place more emphasis on 
modifying behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Punishment for punishment's sake doesn't change behavior in the long run," 
Kehl said. She spends time trying to teach the students what they could do 
differently the next time, so they don't have to return to the in-house room. 
</P>
<P>
Students are assigned in-house suspensions for minor behavior problems, 
including fighting, truancy and disrupting class. More serious offenses, such 
as possession of drugs or weapons, still result in an off-campus suspension, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Santa Ana Unified School District, the "opportunity class," as the 
in-house suspension program is called, is the last disciplinary action before a 
student is sent off-campus. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to bring about a change in the students' behavior without removing 
them from the classroom," said Ernie Gomez, director of child welfare for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
School officials also are pleased about the financial advantages of in-house 
suspension programs. Most of the in-house suspension programs are 
self-supporting because of the money the school gains by bolstering attendance 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
"School districts are really strapped for money," said Seren Schaich, an 
accountant who specializes in educational funding. "They are looking for more 
innovative things to try." 
</P>
<P>
At Orange Unified School District, which has one of the oldest programs in the 
county, officials estimate that it takes only five students to pay the salary 
of a substitute teacher to staff the suspension room. And with three months to 
go in the school year, the program at Buena Park Junior High already has 
generated enough money in the form of increased attendance figures to pay for 
itself, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The in-house suspension program at Buena Park Junior High has drawn praise from 
parents, teachers and even a few students. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Giesen, president of the Home School Assn. at Buena Park Junior High, 
said the program is particularly supported by working parents who don't want 
their children staying home alone all day. 
</P>
<P>
"All parents are very much behind this," Giesen said. "The students are not 
rewarded a day off for bad behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Home economics teacher Diane Fancher has noticed a decline in discipline 
problems among her students. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole year has been better," Fancher said. "I have had students who have 
been in the room, and they don't want to go back." 
</P>
<P>
And among the students, everybody knows the suspension room is bad news. 
</P>
<P>
"They say you can't talk, and there is a real strict lady in there," said 
eighth-grader Joon Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Student Jamal Allen even has kind words for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing," Allen said. "It scares people because they have to lose 
their lunch period."

YES ON MEASURE D ADVOCATED IN SAN JUAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue in San Juan Capistrano is simple. Save farmland from development. I, 
and many like me, have worked at it for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a solution has been difficult. We're not there yet. Now it's again come 
down to a vote. And this time it's for money: Shall the city of San Juan 
Capistrano incur a bond debt of $21 million to preserve open space, save 
farmland and provide recreation areas? 
</P>
<P>
I say yes, by all means. Here are a few reasons why: countywide gridlock, empty 
land poised for cramming with more wall-to-wall houses, disappearing 
ridgelines, more cars, more traffic snarls, fewer trees; in short, less 
goodness, less freedom to enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
Too expensive? I say, it's cheap at 10 times the cost. Measure D (in San Juan 
Capistrano) on April 10 needs a yes vote. The choice is paying a specific 
amount and preserving open space or paying for the consequences of development 
if the bond issue fails.

SOME CLASS ACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was distressed to read Dianne Klein's column (March 25). I have two children 
enrolled at the Roston Montessori Schoolhouse in San Juan Capistrano, the 
oldest having been there over six years. I am a responsible parent who also 
wants the best environment for my children. Both are enrolled at the Roston 
Montessori Schoolhouse because I know that they are receiving the best 
education my money can buy, and I repeat the word buy. 
</P>
<P>
When my children are in the classroom, I know that professional educators are 
instructing them, and that the instructor's attention is not being drawn away 
from the children to parent helpers, who are not qualified to be in the 
classroom. When the children are at school, I know that they are well cared 
for, both in the classroom and at the playground. The environment, in general, 
is one of spontaneity and discipline, learning and exploration. It's fun! 
</P>
<P>
So why am I writing to you? I am a veteran of the private school wars. I also 
have personal horror stories. In fact, at one time my son and eldest daughter 
were enrolled in another private school. For my daughter it was wonderful, but 
for my son it was a disaster. I removed my son and enrolled him in another 
school, but I did not remove my daughter. It was the same school, with two 
different experiences. I demonstrated my objection by removing my son. No 
school fits every child perfectly. To this day I thank the teachers at that 
school for the help they afforded my daughter, even though they created serious 
problems for my son. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the parents who created this tempest really thought that they 
were doing something positive. However, a private school is a business. When 
customers disrupt the business to the detriment of other customers, refusal of 
service is in order. Rokeya Lee was correct in what she did, and she has my 
support and, I would hope, the support of the parents whose children are still 
enrolled in the school.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Fund Committees 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 349 to 71, the House approved a partial committee budget for 1990 
of $56.8 million, up 4.8% over the comparable 1989 authorization and 10.5% over 
actual spending last year. The measure (HR 346) will fund about half the cost 
of the House's approximately 180 committees and subcommittees, with the 
remainder supplied by separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) called the budget "conservative and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) objected to "an increase that is twice the 
level of . . . inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the committee funding.

Rural Development 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 360 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3581) 
delivering federal aid to depressed rural areas. At an estimated cost of more 
than $2 billion over five years, the bill starts new programs, realigns current 
ones and gives states more voice in funding decisions. It shifts certain 
programs from the Farmers Home Administration to a new Rural Development 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also expands the Rural Electrification Administration, eases repayment 
terms of REA and other rural loans and channels aid to communities hurt by 
curbs on timbering in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Flag Issue 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 309 to 101 to withdraw from the U. S. Supreme Court its brief 
for the 1989 law making it a crime to desecrate the American flag. This vote on 
HR 362 was a victory for Republicans who would rather protect the flag by 
constitutional amendment. They objected that the Democratic-approved brief 
asked the court to rule on the flag law in the term beginning in October. They 
saw this as a delaying tactic by Democrats who want to preserve the statute.

Regarding the letter (March 20) on "Meet Your Judges Night," the judges of 
North Orange County Municipal Court want to correct a remark that only about 
100 people showed up: We had more than 200 people in our Spanish-speaking 
courtroom and more than 200 in our English-speaking courtroom, for a total of 
more than 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
The judges of this court were very much pleased that so many people came. We 
have been asked by Loara High School to send a panel of our judges so that 
those young people who could not attend March 6 could ask us questions.

'KEEP IT PRIVATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funny how unimportant matters cause The Times' staff so much grief. Your 
editorial "Gay Bashing and the GOP" (March 17) opines that the California 
Republican Party can now "get on to more important matters" after the party had 
opted to affirm the heterosexual ethic, while Dianne Klein writes (March 18) 
that she "has far more important things to take up (her) time." No doubt, 
Dianne -- but then, why write about it? 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that the public policy issue of homosexuality is only interesting 
to The Times' staff in direct proportion to the political successes of the 
homosexual movement? 
</P>
<P>
I feel confident that if homosexuals would have carried the day in Santa Clara 
it would have been front page news, bold headlines and all. The fact is that 
the Times' staff writhes in pain every time the homosexual movement takes a 
political beating (remember Irvine, Concord, San Francisco and now UC Irvine?). 
Assurances of disinterest cannot hide the frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
All people are welcome in the Republican Party under at least two conditions. 
First, all members should support party platforms. And second, all members 
should check their sexual preferences at the door. 
</P>
<P>
Klein takes umbrage that I define the homosexual quest for social acceptability 
as seeking "special privileges" rather than "civil rights." Homosexuals have 
the same civil rights as other Americans. What they do not have are special 
social privileges that many other Americans have. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, two men do not have the special privilege of a legally recognized 
marriage. They do not have the special privilege of adopting children. They do 
not have the special privilege of unlimited military service. They do not have 
the special privilege of filing a joint tax return. Most significantly, and 
fortunately all Americans lack this privilege, they do not have the right to be 
grossly offensive in public. 
</P>
<P>
The message which fails to penetrate the homosexual pathology is: Keep it 
private, keep it consensual, keep it among adults and nobody will bother you. 
The rest of the world seems able to live by these rules, and they are 
stigmatized when they don't. Why should homosexuals have the "special 
privilege" to forgo these rules?

UNFAIR CONCLUSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article about the visit by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) to Laguna Canyon 
(Reporter's Notebook, March 11) contains inaccuracies that lead the reader to 
unfair conclusions. You wrote, "But no one had asked for Cranston's help in 
resolving the dispute, and many found it strange that a U.S. senator would make 
a special trip to Laguna Beach just to see the site of an obscure housing 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Error No. 1: The city of Laguna Beach, the Laguna Canyon Conservancy and 
Democratic activists have been soliciting Cranston's help with this issue for 
at least two years. A decade ago, Cranston co-sponsored a bill that would have 
created a national park that would have included Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Error No. 2: On a previous visit to discuss offshore oil issues, the senator 
listened to a full presentation on the canyon, complete with maps. A follow-up 
public visit to the canyon with those involved seems to be a natural. 
</P>
<P>
Error No. 3: This is no "obscure housing development" to those of us who know 
and love Laguna Canyon. On Nov. 11, 8,000 Orange County residents made history 
by walking in Laguna Canyon to protest that housing development. 
</P>
<P>
"What good came of it at last?" The wheels of government turn slowly. But today 
the Irvine Co., city officials and environmental groups are sitting together at 
the negotiating table to work out a way for the people of Orange County to buy 
Laguna Canyon. Cranston's environmental aide, Cathy Lacey, is pursuing the 
possibility of Fish and Wildlife funding since the Canyon has the only two 
natural lakes in Orange County and a vernal pool. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's trip to Laguna Canyon may have been the critical turning point in 
our campaign to preserve this incredible wilderness area for Orange County 
residents forever.

A DOCTOR RESPONDS TO STORY ON DEATH OF IMPLANT PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Death Follows Breast Implant" article (March 22): 
</P>
<P>
I was shocked to read your article regarding the tragic death of Martha 
McClellan. I am amazed at the sensationalism and feel compelled to respond. 
</P>
<P>
It is appalling how your paper could tolerate and assent to the inclusion of 
the innuendoes, accusations and comparisons regarding myself and my staff that 
appeared in the article even before any actual tests with their results, 
investigations or reviews have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
Also, does not the family have enough grief than to have it detailed to the 
public and then inaccurately? I think you have gone beyond your journalistic 
freedom in damaging my professional reputation and good name by cleverly 
omitting many pertinent facts and overstating others. To detail them here would 
serve no purpose save to violate patient confidentiality and further prolong 
the trauma to the McCellan family. Let these await an accurate review and 
recounting that should have been done prior to irresponsibly, indiscriminately 
and unfairly passing judgment on a tragic incident!

MISSION VIEJO'S RIVAL GOP GROUPS MERGE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TWO COMMITTEES AVOID A SHOWDOWN OVER THE USE OF THE SAME NAME BY 
AGREEING TO JOIN FORCES INSTEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Call it a political identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Two Republican groups that battled each other during a recent recall campaign 
clashed again last week, this time for the uncontested right to be known as the 
"Mission Viejo Republican Club." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Republican Committee, the official county party, had not 
authorized the name's use by either group. 
</P>
<P>
The showdown came Wednesday night, when officials for the group that originally 
claimed the name, were expected to crash the organizing meeting of the other to 
issue a plea for prospective members. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of another nasty Mission Viejo political battle, such as the one 
rising from the failed attempt to unseat Councilman Robert A. Curtis last 
month, Wednesday's meeting produced something quite unexpected -- compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The two groups agreed to merge into a single Republican entity, and parties 
from both sides are smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"This just shows that Mission Viejo can solve its problems without going 
outside the community," said Ray Carolin, who ran the organizing meeting. 
"Republicans shouldn't throw bricks at each other." 
</P>
<P>
Carolin said he was impressed with Ben Meharg, president of the other 
Republican group, which took a controversial role in the recall election. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed up at the meeting and wanted to know if we could all band together 
for the good of the party," Carolin said. "I respect the guy for that." 
</P>
<P>
Meharg said the agreement would benefit all Republicans in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good meeting," he said. "I'm glad we were able to work something 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Meharg's group first gained attention during the final weeks of the recall 
campaign when, billing itself as the "Mission Viejo Republican Club," it 
criticized Curtis in a mailer sent by pro-recall forces to city voters. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the group was organized at the last minute for the sole purpose 
of discrediting him, Curtis complained to the Orange County Republican 
Committee, which ruled that the organization wasn't authorized to use the 
Republican affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of last week, however, members of the two groups were tense. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Carolin announced the formation of a second Mission Viejo 
Republican Club, both sides came out with stinging criticism of the other. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the first group) are a fraud," Carolin said Monday. "There's no question 
in my mind that they were formed just for the recall. Who ever heard of them 
before the recall?" 
</P>
<P>
Carolin is a candidate for a City Council seat in Mission Viejo's November 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Meharg, a Mission Viejo planning commissioner, said Monday that the formation 
of a second group had caught him by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm somewhat mystified by their accusations," said Meharg, who had come out 
strongly against Curtis. "Our Republican club has been organized since last 
year. I don't know where he's been." 
</P>
<P>
Meharg had contended that his group of about 30 Republicans had the right to 
use the name because "we were the first to use it. I think that counts for 
something." 
</P>
<P>
But now, the unified group will seek the sanction of the Orange County 
Republican Committee in the near future, Carolin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put the recall behind us," he said. "It's time to move on."

Men of influence in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
John Ziegler: As president of the NHL since 1977, he has brought the league 
into a period of full rinks and generally full wallets for owners. Conservative 
on expansion. Criticized for accepting TV contract with SportsChannel America, 
which is available in fewer than half of the league's cities. Gives autonomy to 
Brian O'Neill in disciplinary decisions, to Gil Stein in legal matters and to 
Steve Ryan in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wirtz, chairman of board of governors: The governors make rule and policy 
changes, and Wirtz is the second-most powerful man in the NHL as head of the 
board and co-chairman of key committees. Has long-standing family influence: 
his father, Arthur, and Arthur's partner Jim Norris for years owned teams and 
operated arenas in four of the NHL's original six cities. Wirtz is Ziegler's 
key adviser and has been in charge during Ziegler's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Fletcher, Bill Pulford, Harry Sinden and Bill Torrey: The league's four 
senior general managers are on most key committees, which report to the board 
of governors. When they talk, their peers listen and usually go along. 
Calgary's Fletcher enjoys additional clout as a member of Board of Governors; 
Sinden, of the Boston Bruins, and Torrey, of the New York Islanders, are 
alternate governors but have almost as much say. They know all the rules -- and 
helped write many of them. Considered the league's top hockey minds. Pulford's 
influence stems from longevity and connections as a former player. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Corey, Marcel Aubut: The head of the Montreal franchise is always a 
leader in a league that still is strongly rooted in Canada, but Corey is also 
respected as one of the game's best business minds. Aubut, of the Quebec 
Nordiques, is innovative and able to implement his ideas in a league that 
resists change. Reinstituting overtime was his pet project. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Snider, Norm Green, Glen Sather: Snider, president and governor of the 
Philadelphia Flyers, and his father, Ed, made the team a model expansion 
operation after joining the NHL in 1967. Too outspoken for some hockey people, 
but a staunch defender of the game. Sather has a power base as the general 
manager, president and alternate governor of the Edmonton Oilers, who won four 
Stanley Cups in the 1980s. Shrewd and knows rules -- and loopholes -- well. 
Green, principal owner of the Calgary Flames, is considered progressive for 
urging the acceptance of Soviet players and international play. 
</P>
<P>
David Poile, Gerry Meehan: Both are general managers and power brokers of the 
future. Poile, of the Washington Capitals, is chairman of the general managers' 
committee and sends decisions up to the governors. Has power to appoint general 
managers to various committees, and so can freeze people out or give meaningful 
assignments. Meehan, a former player, paid his dues by getting a law degree and 
serving as the Buffalo Sabres' assistant general manager before moving up. 
Respected for his intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce McNall, George and Gordon Gund, Richard Evans, John Pickett: Money talks, 
so people listen to McNall, owner of the Kings, and the Gund brothers, who 
owned the Cleveland Barons and are now trying to move the Minnesota North Stars 
to Oakland. McNall, however, is looked down upon by some owners and general 
managers as nouveau riche. Richard Evans, president and governor of the New 
York Rangers, has power because a successful New York franchise is essential to 
the NHL's well-being. Pickett is respected for having saved the Islanders from 
near-bankruptcy in the 1970s and for his knowledge and quiet leadership in 
shaping league financial policies.

MATER DEI STREAKING AGAIN, BUT NOT THE RIGHT WAY

<P>
It was a tough week for Mater Dei High School, Orange County's top-ranked 
softball team. The Monarchs lost to Thousand Oaks, 2-1, Saturday in the 5-A 
championship game of the Canyon Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second loss of the week for Mater Dei, which started the season 
12-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei fell behind, 1-0, in the second inning on Saturday when Ericka 
Gulbranson scored on a squeeze. Pitcher Terri Kobata fielded the bunt and made 
a perfect throw to catcher Tracy Rice, but a forceful slide jarred the ball out 
of Rice's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks scored again in the fourth, when Tricia Gregoire doubled and then 
crossed the plate after a grounder glanced off first baseman Amy Moeller's 
glove and into right field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a frustrating way to give up a run, but those things (errors) happen," 
Mater Dei Coach Kathy Quesnell said. "They came out aggressive and we have a 
tendency, when we play aggressive teams, to take a step back. We had our 
chances. We had the baserunners. We just can't get them across." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs had five hits but left four runners on base. Jennifer Cline's 
single drove in Theresa Conway with Mater Dei's lone run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Kobata (5-2) gave up only three hits and had nine strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Terri is a competitor. She wanted this game," Quesnell said. "Thousand Oaks is 
a good team and they're aggressive, but it's too bad we couldn't back Terri 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Kobata, Rice and Cline were named to the all-tournament team and teammate Amy 
Godwin was named tournament MVP on offense. 
</P>
<P>
In other Canyon tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 3, Simi Valley 2 (8 innings) -- Both teams waited until the 
eighth inning to take advantage of the tiebreaker rule and the Barons took home 
the third-place trophy. Fountain Valley's Rae Rice posted her fifth victory 
(5-0). 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 2, Agoura 0 -- Shelley Smith had the game-winning RBI as Los 
Alamitos picked up its 10th victory of the season in the seventh-place game. 
Shannon Skoglund improved to 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph's 5, Huntington Beach 2 -- Kelly Sparks of St. Joseph's went three 
for three with five RBIs to help defeat Huntington Beach (2-7) in the 
ninth-place game. 
</P>
<P>
In nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 2-1, Ocean View 1-4 (first game, 9 innings) -- Three Ocean View 
pitchers combined for a one-hit victory in the nightcap. Marla Pickard got the 
victory with relief help from Tami Dowlin and Jonna Lawson.

Woodbridge High School dominated the ninth Valencia High School Track and Field 
Invitational Saturday, finishing first in the girls' division and second in the 
boys'. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodbridge girls' team finished with 108 points, well ahead of second-place 
Estancia (61) and third-place Gahr (49). 
</P>
<P>
The Warrior boys came within a couple points of winner Valencia (49-47) and 
Foothill finished third (38). 
</P>
<P>
"We only brought six varsity girls today and we still won the meet," Woodbridge 
Coach George Varvas said. "I'm really pleased with our performance, we're right 
on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer won the 400 meters and the 300-meter hurdles and also 
anchored the winning 1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors also received a standout performance from Cathi Peck, who won the 
800 meters and 3,200 meters. But Varvas held Peck out of a race that might have 
proved the meet's most exciting, denying her a rematch with West Covina South 
Hills' Karen Hecox in the 1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"We've faced her before and Cathi lost to Hecox on the kick," said Varvas, who 
explained that the Southern Section, Masters and state meets are where Peck 
will get her chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're going to have Cathi run more half-miles to work on her 
sprinting," Varvas said. 
</P>
<P>
Hecox, regarded as one of the top milers in the state, blew away the rest of 
the field in the 1,600, clocking a meet-record time of 5 minutes 3.35 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
She also anchored the 1,600 relay team, using her impressive kick to bring 
South Hills from 30 meters back to win its heat. 
</P>
<P>
Hecox earned girls' athlete of the meet honors, while La Habra's Mark Gonzales 
took the boys' award for winning the 800 and 3,200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' time of 9:32.68 in the 3,200 was only three seconds off the meet 
record. Valencia's Jose Sandoval finished second at 9:50.73. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval's showing, coupled with a first-place finish by the 1,600 relay team, 
gave the Valencia boys their edge over Woodbridge.

<P>
Mel Silva, the boys' distance coach at Saddleback High School, was hoping for a 
school record in the distance medley at the Tustin Relays on Saturday at Rancho 
Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what the Saddleback quartet of Robbie Price (1,200 meters, 3 minutes 
9.6 seconds), Alex Rico (400, 52.2), Rudy Hernandez (800, 2:04.8) and Eddie 
Salinas (1,600, 4:32.7) did to hold off Mater Dei and win the race in a 
school-record time of 10 minutes 39.7 seconds, breaking their mark of 10:48 set 
this season. Mater Dei finished second in the distance medley in 10:41.0 and 
Marina was third in 10:43.8. 
</P>
<P>
"I put all my big guns in two races," said Silva. "We're taking the distance 
medley team to Arcadia (Invitational, April 7) and we expect to get down to (a 
time of) 10:30." 
</P>
<P>
Price took the lead two laps into the race, running stride-to-stride with Mater 
Dei's Tom McCauley. After 1,200 meters, the Monarchs held a slim lead over 
Saddleback, but Hernandez moved Saddleback into contention, giving Salinas, the 
anchor, a 70-meter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then Mater Dei's Jeff Matsumoto, who placed third in the 1,600 meters at the 
Orange County Championships last week, quickly made up the difference. But he 
came up short as Salinas outran him at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Mater Dei was going to be tough because they have Tom McCauley," Silva 
said. "But fortunately for us, Hernandez had a better day today and he broke it 
wide open for us." 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback also won the 3,200 meter relay, placing third in the meet with 39 
points. Marina won the meet with 50 points and El Toro was second with 45. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Los Alamitos won the team title with 50 points over 
Marina (46) and Santa Ana Valley (42). 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos senior Pam Kurtela competed in four relays, anchoring the sprint 
medley (2:56.0) and the 1,600-meter (4:07.3) teams to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Her teammate, Tracy Fatone, also had a busy day, anchoring the distance medley 
team to first place and the 3,200 squad to third. 
</P>
<P>
In the distance medley, Los Alamitos finished in 12:49.9 to take sixth place on 
the all-time meet list. Fatone, who ran the 1,600 leg of the medley, held off 
Newport Harbor's Kim Robinson, one of the top distance runners in the county, 
to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran against (Robinson) in cross-country," Fatone said. "She is very fast. I 
was just trying to run fast, trying to hold onto the lead and not let my 
(teammates) down." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor was second in the distance medley in 12:55.4 (seventh all-time) 
and Katella was third (13:05.4, ninth all-time). 
</P>
<P>
In the 3,200, Katella's Donna Mills (2:23.8), who recently transferred from 
Tustin High School, Cambria McConnell (2:28.1), Martha Pinto (2:26.4) and 
Debbie Germinaro (2:30.6) broke the school record, winning in 9:50.2. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto, Germinaro, Laura Gamez and Sara Thornton set the old mark of 10:02 last 
season.

Michelle Wesson increased her scoreless inning string to 21 innings by pitching 
a pair of 1-0 upsets over No. 11 San Jose State as the injury depleted Aztecs 
swept a Big West softball double header at SDSU Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Wesson, who played at Christian High School, threw a five hitter in both 
victories. Wesson (11-8) had a 37 1/3 scoreless-inning streak earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (12-19, 4-7) fielded just a dozen players because of injuries. San 
Jose State is 20-10 and 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Droback had the RBI single in the first game and freshman walk on, 
Tracy Stowe of Mt. Carmel High, had the game winner in the second game.

IBM'S INDUSTRIAL POLICY; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITIVENESS: BIG BLUE IS EXTENDING A HELPING HAND TO THE NATION'S BESIEGED 
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY -- PROVIDING VITAL SUPPORT FOR AMERICA'S TECHNOLOGICAL 
BASE.

ARMONK, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The waning days of 1989, a year that generated more than its share of 
disappointment and frustration for International Business Machines, brought yet 
more bad news to the world's largest electronics maker. 
</P>
<P>
Perkin-Elmer, a Connecticut company that is sole supplier of a sophisticated 
semiconductor-manufacturing machine critical to future generations of 
practically every IBM product, was entertaining an attractive bid to sell the 
division making that machine to a Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
The potential sale of such vital technology to Nikon Corp. of Japan triggered 
alarms in California and Washington but perhaps nowhere louder than here at 
IBM's pastoral Hudson Valley headquarters. Within weeks, IBM -- which had 
already committed nearly $100 million to help Perkin-Elmer develop the 
equipment sought by Nikon -- moved to back the efforts of a small and virtually 
unknown California company, Silicon Valley Group, to buy the Perkin-Elmer unit. 
</P>
<P>
That sale is expected to be completed later this month. And IBM, in perhaps its 
most aggressive effort yet on behalf of a valued U.S. supplier, has been behind 
the deal every step of the way. According to several sources familiar with the 
still-confidential agreement, IBM has agreed to become a minority partner in 
the company purchasing the Perkin-Elmer unit. Further, IBM is said to have made 
future purchase commitments as well as promises to underwrite future 
development efforts of the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
The Perkin-Elmer deal is the freshest and most dramatic example yet of an 
unprecedented IBM crusade that, if successful, could help to revitalize the 
embattled U.S. semiconductor industry, respond to Japanese competition and, not 
incidentally, help Big Blue build better and more competitive computers. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's goal is to bolster the technological base, manufacturing expertise and 
overall competitiveness of its key semiconductor suppliers in the United 
States. Some call it IBM's private "industrial policy." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to previous years -- when the computer maker and world's largest 
user of semiconductors preferred to chart a course independent of its 
suppliers, competitors and industry counterparts -- the IBM of today is 
actively forging joint ventures, research and development deals and other 
arrangements with a variety of U.S. and European companies to promote and 
spread technological innovation and competition. 
</P>
<P>
The deals focus on the semiconductor industry because, as a basic component of 
all computers, chips are "technology drivers," the most important ingredients 
of electronic devices. Further, semiconductor makers have been the hardest hit 
by Japanese manufacturers who targeted the chip industry nearly two decades ago 
as a strategic market to master. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the U.S. share of the worldwide semiconductor market has 
steadily eroded from virtual domination to the point where the Japanese are 
predicted to become the world's biggest suppliers of all types of chips by 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's initiative, never before seen by U.S. semiconductor makers, includes 
deals that range from licensing technology to memory chip makers to thwarting 
undesirable acquisitions of key technology. These deals are being made fast and 
furiously, almost at the rate of one every six weeks during the past six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a radical departure for IBM," acknowledged company President Jack D. 
Kuehler. "Traditionally we don't even talk about our competitors and our 
industry. But we are now because it's a necessary part of the process. And 
we're doing it because of our increasing awareness of what we need to do to 
remain competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Added another IBM executive: "It's a new way of thinking for IBM. We recognize 
today that we can't be a success in a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
Although alliances and joint research, development and sales ventures are 
commonplace in many industries these days, they are becoming increasingly 
important and prevalent among high-technology companies because of the rapidly 
escalating costs and competition to make the latest breakthroughs at submicron 
distances and in speeds recorded in billionths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM used to pride itself on its self-sufficiency, and the borders around the 
company were high and secure," explained Robert B. Reich, professor of 
political economy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. 
"But that's all breaking down under the pressure of global competition. IBM is 
actually a newcomer to the alliance game." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to representing a major break from traditional IBM behavior, the 
new strategy is forcing IBM executives into a delicate, global balancing act. 
On one hand the company, whose name is synonymous with the toniest of Wall 
Street's blue chip crowd, wants to pump up a beleaguered and slumping U.S. 
semiconductor industry. But those efforts cannot undermine its own highly 
profitable and fast-growing $9-billion-a-year Japanese subsidiary, or provoke 
retaliatory measures abroad. It's a high-wire trick of no small proportions. 
</P>
<P>
But if successful, analysts say, the strategy can have effects far beyond IBM 
and the U.S. semiconductor industry by providing an example for other global 
industries of what can be accomplished when the largest player in an industry 
decides to take a lead and actively serve as an umbrella to protect suppliers 
and other partners. 
</P>
<P>
Though IBM executives publicly disavow such pronouncements, analysts -- 
unconstrained by the need to remain politic -- say the real, unvarnished intent 
of IBM's policy is to ensure that it will not become a victim or hostage to the 
growing abilities of its huge Japanese competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM clearly fears that the Japanese are going to eat our lunch," says Ulrich 
Weil, a Washington high-technology industry analyst. "They have a clear 
business policy to hold the Japanese at bay. In fact, IBM is saying that if the 
U.S. government can't or won't stop the continuing erosion of the U.S. 
semiconductor and technology industry, then it will stop it." 
</P>
<P>
That view of IBM's strategy is gaining momentum throughout the semiconductor 
and electronics industries. In some quarters, it is even being spoken of as an 
industrial policy that stands in place of one the industry has been 
unsuccessful at persuading the Bush Administration to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM perceives a problem and realizes that if it doesn't act, no one will," 
says Kenneth Flamm, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution, a Washington public policy think tank. "It knows that if it 
doesn't act now, by the time the U.S. government gets off its derriere, it will 
be too late." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years when Big Blue was openly feared and distrusted by 
competitors, suppliers and industry colleagues who worried that its moves could 
easily crush smaller companies, the giant is now scoring points with some of 
the most unlikely judges. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Thomas Campbell (R-Palo Alto), a former Stanford University law and 
economics professor, calls IBM "Benign Big Blue" and praises the company as a 
"champion of American technology . . . and corporate cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
"IBM is doing a lot to help all of us," says T. J. Rodgers, chief executive of 
tiny Cypress Semiconductor and an outspoken critic of government intervention 
in industry. "In a way they are playing Big Brother to the industry. And it's a 
helpful Big Brother, not the '1984' kind." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, adds Rodgers: "We need our Goliaths to fight the Japanese Goliaths." 
</P>
<P>
Back here in Armonk, such notions don't play well. For its part, IBM says it 
remains content to view its strategy narrowly, and to focus on its immediate 
targets: ensuring that it has a steady source of the most advanced technology 
available anywhere on the planet and to balance the distribution of 
technological prowess among the United States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a nice balance and we want a healthy source of suppliers wherever we 
do business," Kuehler said. "It's not a nationalistic issue and it's not a 
nationalism issue. It's an issue of suppliers. We help them wherever they are." 
</P>
<P>
And right now, even Kuehler acknowledged, help is needed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Kuehler said IBM fully recognized the precarious position of the U.S. 
semiconductor industry in 1986 after comparing the technology capabilities of 
American companies to those in Japan. That assessment, he said, became the 
basis for the company's strong push to create Sematech, the semiconductor 
research and manufacturing consortium in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
But even after Sematech opened its doors in 1988, Kuehler added, IBM realized 
"we had to do much more." 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a recent spate of activity, including the failed attempt 
last year to launch U.S. Memories, a cooperative designed to provide another 
U.S. source of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, a product category 
where Japanese manufacturers hold 80% of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time IBM was pushing U.S. Memories -- its former executive Sanford 
Kane spearheaded the unsuccessful effort -- the company was negotiating at 
least three key semiconductor deals. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1989, the company opened its new advanced semiconductor research 
facility in East Fishkill, N.Y., and announced that Motorola would be a partner 
in the center, the first time the company had accepted a competitor as a 
collaborator in its research labs. 
</P>
<P>
The following month, the company stunned the semiconductor industry by 
announcing that it had licensed its state-of-the-art design and manufacturing 
technology for 4-megabit DRAMs to Micron Technology, a small semiconductor 
manufacturer and IBM supplier in Boise, Ida. Four-megabit DRAMs are the next 
generation of advanced memory chips, currently available in prototype form and 
expected to reach peak commercial production within two years. 
</P>
<P>
And in January, IBM and Siemens, the huge West German electronics maker, 
announced that they would jointly develop a 64-megabit DRAM, a chip two 
generations removed from the most advanced currently available. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see a healthier U.S. semiconductor industry and we want to 
work to maintain the health of the European electronics market," Kuehler said. 
"We want a global balance." 
</P>
<P>
Who benefits from this strategy? 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, if IBM is able to strike the balance it so desires, it wins valuable 
sources of supplies and accomplishes the primary goal of its entire effort. 
</P>
<P>
And to the extent that its business partners win additional business from IBM 
or others, they stand to win. But at least some IBM partners aren't being 
Pollyannas about their relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM is less interested in helping us become a world-class chip player than in 
helping themselves have a more diverse supply of chips," says a Micron 
spokesman. "This is strictly business. There is no altruism here." 
</P>
<P>
And, analysts caution, IBM's strategy shouldn't be accepted as a real 
substitute for a U.S. industrial policy for the semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't let the industry, and particularly one company, run the show," said 
Flamm of Brookings. "It sees only its perspective. The government needs to take 
the big view." 
</P>
<P>
Added Steven Cohen, an analyst with SoundView Financial in Stamford, Conn.: 
"Without casting aspersions on IBM's patriotism, the decisions the company is 
making are being made for sound business reasons. That they will increase U.S. 
competitiveness is a nice fall-out." 
</P>

HEART VALVE CASE LEAVES PFIZER UNDER A CLOUD; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: FAILURES OF A DEVICE PRODUCED BY AN IRVINE SUBSIDIARY CONTINUES TO HAUNT 
THE HEALTH-CARE GIANT. CONCERN OVER THE COST OF SETTLING LEGAL CLAIMS HAS 
INVESTORS NERVOUS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pfizer Inc. was supposed to be on a roll in 1990. After years of lackluster 
results, the diversified health-care giant was set to reap the rewards from a 
bevy of blockbuster new drugs. Wall Street critics, impatient for better 
earnings, would finally be silenced. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of a celebration, the beginning of the new decade has been a public 
relations disaster for Pfizer. And the culprit is a product that the company 
hasn't sold since 1986, whose problems were well publicized long ago: the 
Convexo-Concave heart valve, once the key product of Pfizer's Shiley Inc. 
subsidiary in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 86,000 valves implanted in heart patients worldwide between 1979 and 
1986, 391 are known to have failed, with two-thirds of those failures causing 
death. Pfizer stoutly maintains that liability arising from the defective 
valves will have no material impact on earnings now or in the future. Still, 
when public attention was focused on the problem in the wake of a California 
appellate court decision in January, a congressional hearing in February and a 
new lawsuit earlier this month, Pfizer stock plummeted. The stock now trades at 
$61 a share after reaching $75 last year. 
</P>
<P>
And the company is in the unenviable position of losing even if it ultimately 
wins the tangled legal battle over the Shiley valve. Most analysts believe that 
Pfizer and Shiley will be able to refute allegations that they fraudulently 
concealed information about design and manufacturing flaws in the valves and 
will be able to avoid massive liability of the type that destroyed A. H. Robins 
Co., manufacturer of the notorious Dalkon Shield intrauterine device. 
</P>
<P>
But even the rosiest scenario for Pfizer includes years of adverse publicity, 
expensive litigation and costs running into the hundreds of millions of dollars 
to settle claims. And the worst-case scenario is very bad indeed. "It's an 
open-ended problem that will pop up like a jack-in-the-box for years," said 
Christina Heuer, a drug analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in 
New York. "There's a risk investors don't take with other drug companies." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, product liability lawsuits are anything but a rarity in the drug 
and medical products industries. While the Dalkon Shield case remains unique -- 
the victims will ultimately receive $2.4 billion -- the list of companies that 
have been hit with massive liability lawsuits includes Eli Lilly and Co. (for 
the arthritis drug Oraflex), G. D. Searle (for the intrauterine device 
Copper-7), Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals (for the morning sickness drug 
Bendectin) and a veritable laundry list of big drug companies for the pregnancy 
treatment diethylstilbestrol (DES). 
</P>
<P>
Only A. H. Robins, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was later acquired 
by American Home Products, was badly hurt by the litigation. And some cite that 
fact as evidence that Pfizer's risk is limited. "Nothing is going to happen," 
said Joseph Riccardo, a drug analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. 
"That's the history of this business. They got one company." Pfizer, he 
speculated, might pay out "a couple of hundred million over 10 years," a sum 
that would easily be covered by insurance and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer, which earned $681 million on revenue of $5.7 billion last year, can 
clearly weather claims of that magnitude. The company has for years downplayed 
any potential impact from the Shiley litigation and still says the Shiley 
valves have saved the lives of far more patients than they have harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pfizer should get a big financial boost over the next few years from 
several long-awaited products. Smith Barney's Heuer estimates that Procardia 
XL, a new one-a-day treatment for angina and hypertension, will produce $800 
million in new revenue, while the new anti-fungal agent Diflucan will bring in 
$600 million. "They're blockbuster drugs, major winners," Heuer said. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Paul Valles, Pfizer senior vice president, said the company's "financial 
strength is second to none," pointing to a triple-A bond rating from Moody's 
Investors Service. "We have an excellent new product pipeline and the marketing 
expertise to launch that pipeline." Valles called the valve problem "an old 
story" that resulted in "an unjustified level of bad publicity" and said Pfizer 
earnings would grow at a compound annual rate of 10% to 15% in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Shiley, which produces a range of cardiopulmonary products such 
as heart-lung machines but no longer sells heart valves in the United States, 
said the subsidiary hasn't been damaged by the problems. "It's not having an 
impact on the sales of other products," said company President Patrice 
Froidure, though he confirmed that the issue takes up a great deal of his time. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-person task force headed by medical director Roger Sachs has been assigned 
to handle the heart valve issue at Shiley, respond to inquiries from doctors, 
patients and news reporters and try to develop a way to diagnose valves in 
danger of failure. Physicians, key players in the sale of all Shiley products, 
"are not at all hostile to us; they understand there is no product that is risk 
free," Sachs maintained. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart valve jack-in-the-box has been growing steadily more ominous 
since it first reared its head shortly after Pfizer's 1979 acquisition of 
Shiley. The Irvine firm, which pioneered artificial heart valves in the late 
1960s, was at the time rolling out a new product developed with the help of the 
reknowned Swedish heart specialist, Viking Bjork. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Bjork-Shiley 60-degree Convexo-Concave heart valve," the device 
consists of a flexible disk attached to metal rings that are sewn into the 
heart. The disk opens and closes to allow blood to flow through the heart, and 
it is held in place by two struts that are welded to the ring. The 60-degree 
valve, and a similar model known as the 70-degree valve, were supposed to be an 
improvement over older products because they produced a lower incidence of 
blood clotting. 
</P>
<P>
But evidence began to emerge in the early 1980s that the welds holding the 
struts to the ring were prone to failure. The 70-degree valve, which had the 
worst incidence of failure, was never approved for sale in the United States -- 
though it was sold overseas -- and Shiley pulled the 60-degree valve off the 
market in 1986 without conceding that there were design problems. Lawsuits 
arising from the strut failures became more and more frequent through the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Modest estimates by Bear Stearns' Riccardo and others of the heart valve's 
potential impact on Pfizer are based on the assumption that Pfizer will have to 
pay claims only in cases in which the heart valves have actually fractured. The 
company has settled about 200 such lawsuits, and although Pfizer has taken 
pains to keep the numbers secret, attorneys familiar with the cases say the 
settlements have ranged from $250,000 to more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The big danger for Pfizer lies in the possibility that people whose valves have 
not malfunctioned will be able to sue successfully for emotional distress or 
anxiety caused by living with a valve that they know might fail at any moment. 
That specter looms much larger after a California appellate court ruling in 
January that permitted 39-year-old Judy Kahn to claim damages if she can show 
that Pfizer had fraudulently concealed information about problems with the 
valves. 
</P>
<P>
Uncovering such instances of fraud was the object of an investigation and 
subsequent hearings by the House Energy and Commerce Committee investigations 
subcommittee. The committee, headed by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), targeted 
allegedly lax Food and Drug Administration approval procedures for medical 
devices, and the Shiley case was the prime example. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee staff report is sharply critical of Shiley's conduct in the 
affair, stating that the company aggressively marketed the valve "despite 
internal knowledge of serious problems in the manufacturing and quality 
assurance procedures." The report also charges that Shiley failed to disclose 
some early failures of the device to the FDA and didn't share key information 
with the regulatory agency in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence against Shiley includes allegations by Gerry Sherry, a former 
employee, that the company concealed severe quality-control problems in its 
valve production process, and a telex sent by Shiley to Bjork asking him to 
hold off on publishing some data. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer and Shiley maintain that they acted properly throughout and that the 
report failed to produce the devastating indictment of the company that many 
had expected. But Bruce Finzen, an attorney representing Kahn and more than 180 
other Shiley valve recipients, said he is confident that he can show fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fully comfortable going ahead with fraud and failure to warn as a cause of 
action," he said. California, he added, "has recognized the fiction of 
requiring physical injury to recover for emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
How grave a threat to Pfizer could such lawsuits become? Mary Ellen McCarthy, 
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, has developed three 
possible outcomes. Her best-case scenario for Pfizer, in which fracture cases 
are settled for $250,000 each and a very small number of anxiety cases are 
settled, estimates total costs at about $80 million. The worst-case scenario, 
in which settlement costs are $1 million each and the company settles 10% of 
the anxiety cases for the 70-degree model of the valve, points to a bill of 
$800 million. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, after reviewing the Dingell committee report and other documents, 
concluded that Shiley did not commit fraud on the 60-degree valve, although it 
"didn't behave terribly responsibly" in certain instances on the 70-degree 
valve. Her study concludes that "earnings momentum from new product launches 
over the next three years will far outstrip any incremental costs due to Shiley 
valve litigation," and she continues to recommend the stock as a buy. 
</P>
<P>
Even in her worst-case scenario, however, McCarthy doesn't admit the 
possibility of fraud involving 60-degree valves -- the true worst-case for 
Pfizer. Such a finding would open the door to tens of thousands of lawsuits, 
compared to hundreds involving actual fractures. And that issue probably will 
not be put to rest until late 1991 at the earliest, when the first anxiety case 
is expected to come to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney M. Wolfe, director of health research at the Washington-based watchdog 
group Public Citizen and a longtime critic of Shiley, said, "If the 
pre-fracture cases start getting settled or adjudicated, (Pfizer) could get 
cleaned out." He noted that if 50,000 people sue and get $100,000 each, Pfizer 
would be out $5 billion. And if the company is shown to have committed fraud, 
its insurance carriers might not share the burden. 
</P>
<P>
Public Citizen earlier this month also filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles asking 
that Pfizer be required not only to notify all valve recipients of the possible 
problems but also to provide free medical checkups and psychological counseling 
on request. Shiley says it is more appropriate to notify the patients' doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Some shareholders are also disgruntled about the way Pfizer has handled the 
Shiley problems. Several have filed class-action lawsuits in New York alleging 
that Pfizer illegally withheld information about the potential financial impact 
of the Shiley litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the possible effects of the litigation on Pfizer and its subsidiaries 
are almost impossible to measure. Ongoing negative publicity could damage the 
firm's reputation with doctors, consumers and regulatory authorities, although 
Pfizer's Valles denies that has been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Froidure, who has held his post as president of Shiley for less than a year, 
said the impact on morale and recruiting has been less than he anticipated: 
"I'm surprised, but I've been able to hire very, very good people." Shiley, 
which has about $200 million in annual revenue, employs 1,100 people in Irvine 
and another 700 overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer's reputation with investors, however, has been hurt just as the company 
was poised to get back into their good graces with its new products. And it may 
not have the chance to impress Wall Street again soon, since some of the firm's 
major money-making drugs will lose their patent protection in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
In another respect, though, Pfizer's timing isn't so unlucky. The company's 
traditionally modest earnings growth, combined with the fact that it has major 
non-drug operations in areas such as consumer products and specialty chemicals, 
once made the company an object of frequent takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the recent fall in its stock price, which had lost about $2 
billion in market value at one point, analysts say Pfizer is too big to be 
swallowed in the current merger-shy climate. If the Shiley problem had come to 
a head in the go-go 1980s rather than in cautious 1990, Pfizer Inc. as an 
independent company might have been history.

valve at Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
April, 1979 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer Inc. acquires Shiley along with the new Bjork-Shiley 60-degree 
Convexo-Concave heart valve, which has just received FDA approval for marketing 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1980 
</P>
<P>
First of four voluntary recalls following reports of strut fractures on several 
valves; subsequent recalls occurred in 1982, 1983 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
September, 1980 
</P>
<P>
Distribution of Bjork-Shiley 70-degree Convexo-Concave valve begins outside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
July, 1982 
</P>
<P>
Responding to FDA requests to stop distribution until the defective valve 
problem is solved, Shiley assures the government and doctors its valves are now 
reliable. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1983 
</P>
<P>
FDA rules Shiley may continue to distribute its heart valves, saying the 
benefits outweigh the risks. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1983 
</P>
<P>
Shiley begins recall of 70-degree valves less than one week before FDA formally 
revokes its export permit. 
</P>
<P>
April, 1984 
</P>
<P>
Shiley stops manufacturing 60-degree valve after 8,000 valves are reported 
defective. 
</P>
<P>
August, 1984 
</P>
<P>
A former Shiley engineer and Public Citizen, a Ralph Nader group, submit 
documents relating to manufacturing deficiencies in a complaint to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
September, 1984 
</P>
<P>
Despite assertions by Public Citizen and even Shiley's own admissions that the 
60-degree valve may be failing, FDA reiterates that benefits outweigh the risk. 
</P>
<P>
October, 1985 
</P>
<P>
Shiley voluntarily recalls 60-degree valves manufactured after February, 1982, 
that hadn't been implanted. 
</P>
<P>
November, 1985 
</P>
<P>
Canadian man files $32-million lawsuit against Shiley after he nearly died when 
a valve broke inside him; out-of-court settlement reached May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
November, 1986 
</P>
<P>
Shiley voluntarily withdraws all 60-degree valves from distribution. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1988 
</P>
<P>
Shiley, facing about 200 lawsuits, seeks state legislation limiting the ability 
of foreign patients to sue; lawmakers kill the bill. 
</P>
<P>
August, 1988 
</P>
<P>
Shiley is hit with 79 more lawsuits; the company receives a favorable ruling 
from Court of Appeals limiting lawsuits by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1990 
</P>
<P>
Latest figures indicate that of the 86,000 valves implanted worldwide, 391 
reported strut fractures.A California appelate court rules that patients whose 
valves have not fractured can sue for emotional distress if they can show 
Shiley fraudulently withheld information about problems with the valves. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1990

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / ALLAN H. MELTZER: UNCLE SAM SHOULDN'T TOSS MONEY 
INTO R&amp;D 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Economy at Carnegie Mellon University and a visiting scholar at the American 
Enterprise Institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
Should the federal government use taxpayers' money to develop new technologies? 
Should the government subsidize potential economic winners to encourage their 
development? Does ideology prevent the Bush Administration from adopting an 
industrial policy that could strengthen American industry? 
</P>
<P>
One of my colleagues who writes in this space says that only stubborn, 
ideological belief explains why the government does not invest in priority 
industries such as consumer electronics, microchips and others. The usual cry 
about losing the technological race is followed by a common but fallacious 
argument: The economy is not the pure model of the textbooks; government now 
has a large influence on the economy, so it is only a matter of straightening 
out the priorities. Subsidies for new technology can be paid for by reducing 
wasteful government spending for agriculture, housing and defense. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know whether to laugh or sigh. Anyone can come up with a list of 
priorities and assume a government with infinite wisdom that wants to do good 
things because they are right. Doesn't it beg the question to leave the matter 
there? How will a government -- specifically our government -- avoid the waste, 
the bureaucracy and the costly mistakes that characterize many (but not all) 
government programs? How does it avoid the pressures from voters and interest 
groups that are part of the political process in our democracy? What is the 
government's record on previous priority programs? 
</P>
<P>
President Lyndon B. Johnson declared war on poverty 25 years ago. As Charles 
Murray showed so well in his book "Losing Ground: American Social Policy 
1950-1980," the poverty rate declined much faster before than after the 
so-called war began. Largely as a result of Murray's book, experts debate 
whether most of the billions of dollars spent in the war did more harm than 
good. The fact that the experts do not agree on the answer says a lot. 
</P>
<P>
President Richard M. Nixon declared war on cancer. Billions of dollars later, 
experts debate whether the increased spending contributed much to reduce the 
death rate from cancer. Some reductions in the death rate have occurred, but 
many are the result of earlier detection and greater public awareness. Perhaps 
there will be a great payoff in the future, but at the very least it is 
unclear, after almost 20 years, whether the public has received a return on its 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Are more examples needed to illustrate that shifting responsibility for 
investment, research or spending decisions to government is not a sure-fire way 
to pick winners and avoid losers? Vocal interest groups managed to increase 
spending for AIDS research without any evidence that the money taken from other 
types of spending -- including private spending -- added to society's wealth or 
well-being. There is nothing unusual about that decision. Public passions and 
fads often become public spending priorities in a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Is it ideology or evidence that tells us that government is failing at some of 
its traditional tasks? Public education, once considered an outstanding 
success, is now widely regarded as failing to train a generation in basic 
skills. Protection of citizens and their property against crime, one of the 
earliest functions of government, is far below the standards achieved a 
generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
Is it ideology that tells us that government involvement in agriculture and the 
thrift industry has produced a costly mess? After 1985, the government paid 
farmers to kill more than 1 million cows and remove millions of acres from 
production. Government programs raise prices to consumers, then give food 
stamps to part of the population to offset some of the price increases caused 
by these policies. Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.) estimates that the total cost of 
these programs is about $20 billion a year in taxes and $10 billion in higher 
prices. This is a pittance compared to the thrift bailout, now estimated at 
$150 billion to $200 billion and rising. Here the record of government 
management is atrocious. They allowed the cost of the bailout to rise from 
about $5 billion in 1982 despite frequent warnings about the mounting costs 
from both inside and outside the government. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any reason to believe that increasing government responsibility for 
research, development, investment and output will more likely produce startling 
or even adequate return instead of failures such as those in education, crime, 
agriculture and elsewhere? Certainly, there are examples of governments making 
good decisions, even better decisions than the marketplace. The reason is not 
hard to find. A barrel of monkeys will type all the words in Shakespeare if 
they are given enough time and paper. The issue is not whether the government 
has made good decisions at times. The issue is whether government has some 
special ability or expertise to manage research or investment. 
</P>
<P>
Government has no comparative advantage in making decisions about research, 
development and investment. It is not that government officials are less smart 
or knowledgeable. There are three more fundamental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
First, people are more careful about the risks that they take when they get the 
rewards and pay for the losses. Closing down the losers and continuing to 
finance the potential winners requires tough judgments about what will be a 
winner or a loser, often in highly uncertain situations. There is no road map. 
Errors come from both sides: too much caution or too little. Government has no 
advantage, and many disadvantages, in making decisions of this kind. 
</P>
<P>
Second, many complain that the private sector is overly concerned about 
short-term results. Despite frequent repetition, it is far from certain that 
this claim is true of all or even most industry. But, shifting decisions to 
government is not the way to lengthen decision horizons. Government is tied to 
the election cycle -- the need to show or claim quick results in time for the 
next election. Government is also more prone than private investors to choose 
costly programs such as sending people to Mars or throwing additional resources 
into losing projects to avoid reporting failures. 
</P>
<P>
Third, it is a mistake to centralize research in a government laboratory or in 
a consortium such as Sematech (to do research on semiconductors) or in the 
proposed Technology Corp. of America (to invest in new technologies) and other 
such schemes. The great strength of America's research institutions, including 
research universities and private laboratories, comes from competition and 
diversification. Competition to be the first to make a new discovery is spurred 
by the knowledge that someone at another university has read the same technical 
papers and may be working on the same approach. Competition helps to maintain 
premier research institutions among America's valuable assets. Diversification 
means that independent researchers, driven by competition, explore alternative 
technologies and alternative ideas leading to many different developments. 
Scientific meetings, competition for space in leading journals and competition 
for research funds, including government funds, weed out less attractive ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions about research, development and investment in new technologies are by 
their nature highly uncertain. Successful strategies in such cases almost 
always include pursuit of many different opportunities. One great source of 
strength in the present system is the diversity that comes from competition. 
</P>
<P>
Does the system work perfectly? Of course not. Does the private sector always 
make the right choices? Of course not. But more than ideology is behind the 
Bush Administration's conclusion that the present system works better than 
having government choose winners, losers and areas of research.

KAZAKHSTAN: LIFE AND DEATH IN THE SHADOW OF THE MUSHROOM CLOUD; 
</P>
<P>
FALLOUT: SOVIET CITIZENS REMEMBER HOW THEY WERE MISLED ON NUCLEAR TESTING. THEY 
WONDER WHY THE U.S. HAS NOT AGREED TO STOP SUCH TESTS.

KARAUL, U.S.S.R. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I witnessed the first H-bomb explosion," said Talgat Slyambekov. "Afterward 
they gave us a checkup and the military men gave us some vodka as protection 
against radiation." 
</P>
<P>
In this remote village on the northern steppe of Soviet Kazakhstan, the wind 
drives ice and snow against dilapidated shacks. The hardship of life is etched 
in the face of every resident. In Karaul, life has been especially hard. Since 
the dawn of the atomic age the Soviet Union has tested its nuclear weapons 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Karaul would seem an unlikely place to test the reach of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
reforms. But on the wind that howls across the barren landscape, glasnost has 
come to Karaul. In late February I talked with residents about the effects of 
nuclear testing on their lives. For four decades they have been afraid to 
speak, but now they voice anger and a deep sense of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
"For 40 years," Slyambekov said, "the military-industrial complex has waged 
undeclared nuclear war against us. I call this genocide. They tried to 
eliminate us. No one ever told us that there was any danger." 
</P>
<P>
When the Soviet Union tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1953, Karaul was 
evacuated; 40 people were told to remain behind, Slyambekov one of them. "We 
never knew why they left us here." 
</P>
<P>
Rimhan Gabduilin also remained behind. He is a slight man with a thin voice, 
but speaks forcefully about the day he saw the mushroom cloud of the H-bomb. 
"Of the 40 people they left in this village, only six are alive today. All the 
others died when they were 50 or 60 years old. The military men told us it is 
not dangerous at all. If it isn't dangerous, why do they check the wind 
direction before any test? Why don't they explode the bombs next to Kurchatov 
City itself?" Kurchatov is the home of the secret-weapons laboratory that 
conducts Soviet nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
"They never asked for our permission to put this test site here," said 
Slyambekov. "They knew it was dangerous even back then. But we were really 
afraid to talk about it openly. It was a real secret. But with glasnost and 
perestroika we have some democratic change in this country . . . . For the last 
two years I've tried to do my best to abolish nuclear weapons and to eliminate 
this test site." 
</P>
<P>
"Please -- tell your government that we are all human beings," pleaded Zagnar 
Zunuszanov, a former party leader in the region. "Who wants to commit suicide? 
Who doesn't think about his children? Such a person would be a fool or a 
madman. Americans are not fools. Please tell them, and your government, that we 
shall not repeat history. We are just people trying to stop nuclear tests, but 
the United States keeps on testing. We are ready to close our test site. Why 
don't Americans do the same? Why do you let it happen?" 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet victims of the bomb are angry with their government. They are also 
puzzled and frustrated by the U.S. refusal to join the Soviets in a mutual test 
moratorium. From August, 1985, to February, 1987, the Soviets unilaterally 
stopped nuclear testing but failed to elicit U.S. reciprocity. Gorbachev has 
repeatedly pledged that the Soviet Union will enter a moratorium on a moment's 
notice if the United States will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. anti-nuclear activists have been unable to match the success of a new 
anti-testing movement in Kazakhstan called the Nevada/Semipalatinsk Movement 
(after two major nuclear test sites). 
</P>
<P>
Only a year old, the movement has had a profound impact on Soviet nuclear 
testing. Alexei Manshosov, first secretary in the Foreign Ministry's 
disarmament section, said the Nevada/Semipalatinsk Movement forced cancellation 
of 11 of the 18 scheduled tests in 1989. The test site has remained silent 
since October of last year, an unusually long time. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Moscow capitulated to one of the movement's most urgent demands. The 
government announced that nuclear tests in Kazakhstan would be phased out by 
1993 and testing moved to a remote island near the Arctic Circle, Novaya 
Zemlya. 
</P>
<P>
Men like Zunuszanov, Gabduilin and Slyambekov are part of the movement's 
strength, resolute in their support of charismatic leader Olzhas Suleimenov, a 
poet and writer. Suleimenov rode a wave of Kazakh anti-nuclear sentiment to a 
seat in the Congress of People's Deputies, and from there to the Supreme 
Soviet, where he is a formidable presence who has the ear of Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Tajiken Humadilov, a proud veteran of the Great Patriotic War (the Soviet name 
for World War II), is also a strong supporter: "I spent my whole life working 
for the party, the Soviet people and the government. All this time I wondered 
why the United States -- a great, powerful country whose people believe in God 
-- wanted to stay ahead of us. For many years I believed that what our 
government was doing was necessary -- that we needed rockets and bombs to 
protect us from the United States. We didn't know whether the atomic mushrooms 
were armful or not. 
</P>
<P>
"Five people in my family died of cancer," said Humadilov. "My older brother in 
1960. My oldest son last year. My younger brother two years ago. My parents 
died of cancer when they were old . . . . So how can I support the creation of 
this weaponry after so many people died of it?" 
</P>
<P>
Humadilov's account reflects a trend in the Soviet Union -- what some call 
"radiophobia" -- to blame all illness on radiation from various sources. There 
could, of course, be other explanations for the illnesses in Humadilov's 
family, but like many others, he believes death is linked to the test site. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence is mounting in the United States and the Soviet Union that 
nuclear-weapons production and testing has taken a severe toll on health and 
the environment. The first independent medical reports on the impact of tests 
on residents of Kazakhstan will be issued during the International Citizens 
Congress on a Nuclear Test Ban this May in Alma-Ata. The congress is being 
convened by the Nevada/Semipalatinsk Movement and the International Physicians 
for the Prevention of Nuclear War. 
</P>
<P>
Ulogbek Baiurbekov shouted out as I was about to leave Karaul: "We veterans of 
the Great Patriotic War demand that this test site be closed," an ultimatum 
from a 75-year-old who fought in one war and witnessed preparations for 
another. 
</P>
<P>
What is so striking about the villagers' sentiments is how similar their 
stories are to those told by Americans from towns like St. George, Utah; 
Fredonia, Ariz., and Bunkersville, Nev. For years American "downwinders" (those 
who live downwind from the U.S. Nevada Test Site) have waged an unsuccessful 
legal battle against their government, for redress from injuries allegedly 
suffered as a result of nuclear tests. The U.S. government knew the tests posed 
a serious threat to those living downwind. But rather than warnings, government 
only issued false assurances. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't money they want," said Steve Erikson, a spokesman for the 
organization Downwinders. "They want an admission by the government that it did 
this to them. All along the government has said, 'Oh no, we didn't.' It has 
left a lot of people with this nagging doubt about why their family members are 
dying or dead. It's a sense of justice they want, not money." 
</P>
<P>
Half a world apart, patriotic citizens -- downwinders who also believed in 
their government -- were enduring the same hell for the same reasons. Human 
guinea pigs were created, trust betrayed; loyalty and patriotism were 
exploited. 
</P>
<P>
In May at the International Citizens Congress, U.S. downwinders and Soviet 
downwinders will meet for the first time. They will have much to tell one 
another -- all consider themselves victims of the atomic bomb.

GATHERS: LESSON OF THE HEART; 
</P>
<P>
SUDDEN DEATH: MORE PEOPLE DIE OF HEART-RHYTHM DISORDERS THAN CANCER. FINDING 
AND TREATING HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE '90S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David S. Cannom, David S. Cannom is an electrophysiologist at the Hospital 
of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles, president of the Los Angeles affiliate of 
the American Heart Assn. and a member of the Coalition for the Prevention of 
Sudden Cardiac Death. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If any good is to come out of the Hank Gathers tragedy, it will be in helping 
to prevent such a premature ending to other lives, whether young or old. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of sudden and unexpected death caused by cardiac arrhythmias is a 
huge public-health issue. The American Heart Assn. estimates that 400,000 
Americans will die this year in the United States of a lethal heart-rhythm 
disorder -- more than will die of cancer and roughly half of the 700,000 annual 
deaths from cardiovascular causes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the American public knows little about sudden death and, to some extent, 
that is also true within the medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
Which types of structural heart disease -- disease of the heart muscle and 
coronary arteries -- are most commonly associated with serious heart rhythms? 
Most such conditions are diseases of men and women more than 35 years of age 
and not of young athletes. By far the most common cause of sudden death over 
age 35 is coronary artery disease. In patients dying suddenly under age 35, 
congenital heart disease -- heart disease present from birth -- is the most 
common cause. 
</P>
<P>
Which are the high-risk groups of patients? Experts estimate that approximately 
25% of all patients experiencing a heart attack -- which doctors call a 
myocardial infarction, usually caused by a clot in the narrowed coronary artery 
-- have sudden death as their first and only symptom. In retrospect, such 
patients have often had vague complaints but were unaware of any heart trouble 
until they abruptly fibrillated and died. This group numbers hundreds of 
thousands of patients a year. A typical victim is the 45-year-old jogger who 
keels over on his Saturday morning run and dies. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot yet specifically screen this group of patients in terms of 
sudden-death risk. The best we can do is screen for risk factors associated 
with early coronary disease, including high cholesterol, cigarette smoking and 
high blood pressure. We know that if we can lower or eliminate coronary 
disease, the risk of sudden death will be lowered as well. Large numbers of 
people without symptoms -- asymptomatic individuals -- must be screened if we 
are to identify a sizable high-risk population, much less prevent any but a few 
sudden deaths. More specific non-invasive screening and preventive techniques 
for sudden death are necessary to help this large population of completely 
asymptomatic patients. Although sudden death rates in this group are falling, 
much remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
Groups with a statistical risk of sudden death, higher than among the 
asymptomatic people, have been clearly identified over the past decade. A 
patient who experienced a prior heart attack has a 6% risk of death in the 
first year of recovery; half these deaths are sudden. The risk of death rises 
steeply if the heart attack was large or associated with serious ventricular 
rhythm disorders. Former Commissioner of Baseball A. Bartlett Giamatti was such 
a sudden-death victim. 
</P>
<P>
Most cardiologists aggressively screen patients after a heart attack for both 
serious arrhythmias and extensive muscle damage, using a combination of 
invasive and non-invasive testing to identify the high-risk patient. 
Considerable controversy still exists, however, about which treatment is best 
to prevent subsequent sudden death. Large population studies, such as the 
highly publicized Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), help teach us 
which medicines, if any, best control abnormal heart rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-risk patients are those who have survived a previous cardiac arrest 
or have required an electrical cardioversion. Patient groups with up to a 40% 
one-year risk of recurrent cardiac arrest can be identified. Such patients are 
aggressively treated in most centers with implantable defibrillators or 
open-heart procedures to correct the arrhythmia. Most progress of the last 
decade has been made with such patients. If appropriately treated, such 
patients can have their one-year risk of sudden death reduced to about 1%. 
While highly visible, this patient group nonetheless represents only a small 
percentage of the total number who will die suddenly this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other heart conditions associated with an increased incidence of sudden death 
include cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) 
syndrome and the long-QT syndrome. The latter two conditions are rare, although 
of great interest to cardiologists as models of electrical short-circuits in 
the heart. Mitral valve prolapse is commonly diagnosed but rarely causes sudden 
death. Cardiomyopathy, or primary heart muscle disease, is usually acquired 
following a virus infection. Hank Gathers' post-mortem examination showed such 
a diffuse cardiomyopathy. 
</P>
<P>
About half the athletes who die suddenly have a different kind of muscle 
disease called a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Such hearts are always thick and 
"muscle-bound," either in part or all of the cardiac structure. However, such a 
condition does not spell a potential episode of sudden death unless coupled 
with a serious ventricular rhythm disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
There is no agreement on how to screen young athletes for potential risk of 
sudden death if they are truly asymptomatic. Mass screening programs involving 
physician examinations and non-invasive testing are not cost-effective. As many 
as 200,000 asymptomatic competitive athletes under 30 need to be thoroughly 
screened to identify one potential sudden death victim. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the Gathers case is typical of what we know about the 
sudden-death victim. He had a history of a skipping, rapid pulse. He had 
blacked out during a basketball game in December but quickly revived. Such a 
symptom is a red flag of concern in any age group. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent testing by experts in heart-rhythm disorders identified irregular 
beats originating from the lower portion of his heart as the cause of the 
blackout. He was given specific medication to treat the irregular rhythm; there 
was an implication that if he took the medication he would be protected from 
serious problems. The medicine, a beta blocker, slowed his enormous talents -- 
and he may have cut back on the drug. He then collapsed during a game in March 
and could not be resuscitated. The triad -- loss of consciousness in the 
presence of serious extra heart beats and known muscle damage -- identified him 
as being at high risk, no matter what his age group or underlying cardiac 
diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
The other cornerstone of sudden-death prevention -- in addition to detection 
and treatment of the high-risk patient -- is cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- 
CPR. The American Heart Assn. and Red Cross teach thousands of volunteers each 
year how to perform CPR. Citizen CPR in conjunction with a rapid-response 
paramedic system can successfully resuscitate a high percentage of patients who 
collapse from cardiac arrhythmias. In cities such as Seattle and Miami, where 
paramedics respond quickly and half the citizenry knows CPR, up to 30% of 
sudden-death victims will be resuscitated and eventually discharged from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, resuscitation did not occur in the gymnasium when Hank Gathers had his 
serious arrhythmia. Such missed opportunities are repeated in shopping malls, 
city streets and homes of heart patients 1,000 times each day in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The next decade will see cardiologists further cut the sudden-death toll. More 
patients with the combination of serious arrhythmias, symptoms and known heart 
disease will be referred for treatment. More effective, less-toxic medications 
will be developed. Better implantable devices will be perfected. Large 
population studies will tell us which patients need the most aggressive 
treatment and which need only reassurance. More citizens will learn and 
practice CPR, perhaps in a simpler form. 
</P>
<P>
If Gathers' death has helped alert us to the scope of the problem and its 
prevention, then the tragedy will have served some human purpose.

When executions were scheduled in the public squares, crowds turned out in 
droves to watch a criminal be hanged -- or drawn and quartered like a chicken. 
Souvenirs were sold, along with picnic lunches. Some witnesses found the 
executions edifying; others came for the gore. 
</P>
<P>
Now executions happen behind closed doors. Instead of watching death throes, 
the public sees video images of protesters or advocates of the death penalty. 
But the focus is where it always has been -- on the criminal as center of 
attention. Meanwhile, everyday evil goes on unabated. And the level of violence 
has risen -- notoriety does not come as easily these days. 
</P>
<P>
Even as California is once again preoccupied by death row and the now-postponed 
execution of Robert Alton Harris, most inmates awaiting execution stay alive. 
The institutions housing them are dead. Instead of places for rehabilitation, 
for building new lives, prisons have become basic training camps for the most 
vicious forms of urban warfare. Inmates are clothed, sheltered and fed, living 
off the welfare of their victims. Prisoners expect the system to look after 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The current "corrections" system is full of retribution without reform: Either 
snuff out life or maintain it in cages. Most inmates live passively, like 
domestic pets, until released for the next opportunity to prey on society. The 
retributive system is purely retrospective -- a view of evil past with little 
sense of evil to come. 
</P>
<P>
Yet looking ahead -- paying attention to prison life and life in prison -- 
would be far more rewarding. Prisoners could become working people, not animals 
in cages. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have a topsy-turvy view of criminal life and death: Capital 
punishment is said to be humane while a sentence at hard labor is considered 
cruel and unusual. 
</P>
<P>
California Gov. George Deukmejian and a few key legislators would like 
prisoners to pay their way, instead of having society pay it for them. Why, 
they ask, can't prisons make a profit for the state? 
</P>
<P>
Labor unions detest the idea. The AFL-CIO main man in Sacramento, John Henning, 
says labor will not tolerate the taking of jobs from hard-working, law-abiding 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
If that means prisoners must continue to be idle, ignorant, living off a 
welfare state behind bars -- all the while plotting the next crime -- then so 
be it. That's not a union problem, the unions say. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is a problem -- and peril -- for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's idea begins at home: Many jobs have left California for overseas 
-- South Korea and Japan, for instance. Why can't the state lease out its 
prison work force to do those jobs here, building stereos and VCRs, microchips 
and auto parts? That would not take jobs away from working Californians, it 
would be taking jobs from foreign competition. Major corporations can make 
their wares more cheaply using prison labor than they could abroad. 
</P>
<P>
If prisons had a profit-making purpose, more prisons could more easily be 
built, as personnel pools for nearby industries. California has an abundant 
supply of able-bodied crooks; state prisons might even become welcome in East 
Los Angeles or Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The unions respond with complaints of unfair competition. Since they cannot 
fight lower wages paid abroad, they try to keep wages up at home -- until the 
factories close. Legislators who warm to Deukmejian's proposal are threatened 
with union opposition in elections. What politician wants to be presented as an 
enemy of honest working people? 
</P>
<P>
So the governor's notion keeps losing in the Legislature. Henning works his 
spell year after year. So the prisons fester as breeding grounds for crime, 
moribund places where inmates can always come home, for a roof over their heads 
and three free meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
A large prison population, like a standing army, makes the rest of the work 
force smaller than it would otherwise have been. This, in turn, keeps the 
demand for unskilled labor higher and pushes wages up. Yet the costs of 
incarceration rise, not to mention the waste of time and potential. U.S. 
taxpayers, including union members, must pay twice for the ignorant and 
unemployed who prey on the public -- once as victims of a crime and once again 
to house their victimizers. 
</P>
<P>
Labor, in opposition to prison laborers, seems to be overlooking the dignity of 
work. Self-respect is a byproduct of honest labor; criminals at least deserve 
the chance to experience it. That same respect for the dignity of labor once 
led the unions, in their glory days, to defend children and pieceworkers 
against corporate abusers. But the philosophy seems to have changed, from human 
interest to self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of prison labor are not interested in "make-work"; they propose real 
manufacturing, real jobs that teach real skills. They do not advocate chain 
gangs or "slave labor"; prisoners would be paid. But their wages would be 
applied to the costs of housing them. Criminals, at last, would earn their 
keep. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives are applicable; inmates who become good workers can be rewarded, in 
terms of better quarters, creature comforts or visiting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Inmate earnings beyond the cost of room and board can benefit the prisoner and 
the state. Funds may put in savings, for the prison worker, payable upon 
release. Profits from the leasing of labor would go to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Education and skilled labor go together. Education civilizes. Labor produces. 
In the course of training prisoners for productive work, more inmates would 
learn to read and write and think. They would have skills and disciplines to 
bring back to the outside world. Good workers know about responsibility and the 
interpersonal regimens for getting on in life. 
</P>
<P>
Prisons, right now, are storage bins, with few windows or connections to the 
world outside. Providing connections could give prisoners a better chance of 
one day contributing to that outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Retribution and revenge are extremely expensive. Convict labor can compensate. 
It may even rehabilitate.

COMPENSATE INNOCENTS IN HARM'S WAY; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: CIVILIANS WERE PART OF THE CASUALTY EQUATION AS U.S. TROOPS WENT IN. 
THEY SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED AS THE TROOPS LEAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KIYONAGA and JOHN KIYONAGA, David Kiyonaga and John Kiyonaga are 
lawyers in Alexandria, Va., who represent more than 100 Panama invasion 
victims. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Jan. 25, President Bush announced a $1-billion package of aid for the 
reconstruction of Panama that consists of grants, loans and trade benefits. 
Guillermo Endara, the new president of Panama, responded with thanks and muted 
remarks that Panama needs more -- smiles and good will all around. 
</P>
<P>
No one is smiling in Santo Tomas, Panama City's municipal hospital. Dimly lit 
hallways open to crowded wards that smell of equal parts disinfectant, human 
waste and stale blood. The beds, two feet apart, are all full. The people are 
quiet. Some lack a limb or two. Some are in traction. All are in bandages. 
These are the flotsam of our invasion of Panama. Civilians who were unlucky 
enough to get in the way. Most are from the poor neighborhoods where the 
heaviest fighting occurred. They may know about President Bush's relief 
package, but none expect their own government to turn it into meaningful relief 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
Maricela McFarland was asleep in Chorillo with her three daughters when the 
assault on the nearby Comandancia began. She was leading them out of her house 
when a shard of shrapnel took a pound of her thigh and all but tore off her 
2-year-old daughter's foot. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Cubilla was drinking water in his kitchen at 8 o'clock on the morning 
of the invasion. A helicopter gunship strafing Dignity Battalion members nearby 
sent a stray round through his roof. The oldest of his five children, his 
18-year-old son, rushed in to find him splayed in the corner. He lost a lung 
and a kidney and suffered liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
Heriberto Pitti had worked for Eastern Airlines for 19 years. He was on the 
night shift as a cargo agent at the Eastern hangar when our troops attacked the 
airport. Pitti, Pablo Diaz and another colleague jumped into an Eastern pickup 
and raced out of the hangar. The truck took seven rounds through the 
windshield, killing all three men. Pitti left a widow and two daughters; Diaz 
left a widow and 12 children. 
</P>
<P>
These are not isolated cases. Although the number of dead noncombatants has 
been listed at 202, unofficial tolls are higher. The wounded outnumber the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Combat in densely populated areas is nothing new, but Panama is not Vietnam or 
Germany of 1945. As a people and as a government -- except during the latter 
part of Manuel A. Noriega's leadership -- Panama has been friendly toward the 
United States for all of its nearly 90 years as a nation. Through construction 
and management of the canal, America and Panama have developed a unique 
interdependence. For decades, Panamanians and Americans have lived, worked and 
raised families together. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion of Panama was well planned and executed. Nonetheless, many of the 
military targets were in thickly settled areas. Planners must have expected 
heavy civilian casualties. These casualties were part of the equation as our 
troops went in and they should not be ignored as our troops leave. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed aid package is a generous show of support to Panama's new 
government. It won't, however, help the individuals who need and deserve help, 
too. The package is designed primarily to alleviate Panama's foreign debt, fund 
government-reconstruction programs and provide low-interest loans and trade 
benefits to Panama's businesses. It includes no compensation for innocent 
victims of the invasion. Even if did, though, it would be unfair to burden 
Panama's new government with the task. 
</P>
<P>
The United States should compensate the innocent people who can substantiate 
claims of injury or loss from the invasion. We decided to invade. We should 
attend to the actual victims. 
</P>
<P>
This would not be without precedent. The United States has compensated the 
innocent victims of our combat in the Dominican Republic after the invasion of 
1965 and in Grenada after the invasion of 1983. In the Dominican Republic and 
again in Grenada, the U.S. Army established a field office solely to adjudicate 
and pay claims from invasion victims. Claims attorneys for the Army have the 
training to substantiate losses and ensure that claims are, in fact, for 
innocent noncombatants. 
</P>
<P>
The United States should not overlook the human element in Panama's recovery -- 
especially after our political, material and human investment in making it safe 
for democracy.

In the Mood (HBO Monday at 11:15 p.m., Saturday at 2:30 p.m.): In 1987, 
writer-director Phil Alden Robinson, whose latest film is "Field of Dreams," 
made this amusing and lively movie about a local legend, Sonny Wisecarver 
(Patrick Dempsey), who as a 14-year-old Willowbrook youth eloped with a 
21-year-old mother of two (Talia Balsam) a month before D-day. Beverly D'Angelo 
plays yet another older woman in Sonny's life. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet, funny and rueful. (1:40) 
</P>
<P>
The Rosary Murders (Bravo Tuesday at 11 p.m.): Fred Walton's engrossing 1987 
mystery illuminates a complex and special world of the Catholic Church while 
steadily building suspense. Donald Sutherland excels in one of the most 
substantial, reflective roles of his career as a Detroit priest confronted with 
a serial killer who murders only nuns and priests. With Charles Durning, 
Belinda Bauer and Josef Sommer. (1:41) 
</P>
<P>
Monsieur Verdoux (TNT Tuesday at 11:45 p.m.): In Charles Chaplin's staggeringly 
pitch-dark 1947 satire, he bids farewell to The Tramp to play a dapper, devoted 
family man who systematically marries and murders a series of women -- 
including, hilariously, Martha Raye -- for their money. Chaplin's point was 
that the ruthlessness of his Bluebeard mirrors the values of the world in which 
he struggles to survive. (2:45)

Desert Bloom (HBO Sunday at 11 a.m.): In his overlooked 1986 film, 
writer-director Eugene Corr does what you never thought possible: He makes you 
feel nostalgic about being 13 in the 1950s. Corr deftly parallels a 
coming-of-age story with the dawning of the nuclear era. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is Las Vegas, the heroine is lovely Annabeth Gish and the cast 
includes Jon Voight, Ellen Barkin, JoBeth Williams and Allen Garfield (as the 
one man in the story who views the first above-ground A-bomb test with 
appropriate alarm). 
</P>
<P>
The Women (TNT Saturday at 11:30 p.m.): This 1939 classic, directed by George 
Cukor and based on Clare Booth Luce's play, stars Norma Shearer as the perfect 
suburban wife whose husband has nevertheless been snared by a hard-as-nails 
Joan Crawford. There's not a man in sight in this delightful comedy, but its 
array of stars includes Paulette Goddard and Rosalind Russell. Kevin Thomas

Dead Calm (Cinemax Sunday at 10 p.m., Wednesday at 11:45 p.m., Friday at 10 
p.m.): Phillip Noyce's 1989 thriller is a spare, smart, seductive piece of real 
movie making with (almost) every loophole covered, a superlative cast and 
enough tension to keep us all hyperventilating for hours. Sam Neill and Nicole 
Kidman are on an extended South Pacific voyage when they cross paths with 
insinuating Billy Zane. 
</P>
<P>
Zelig (Channel 13 Monday at 10 a.m.): This is a sweet, piercing, startlingly 
inventive film, a little rueful around the edges, in which Woody Allen fakes a 
documentary about one Leonard Zelig (played by Allen) who in his meteoric 
moment in the public eye stood somewhere between Charles Lindbergh and Babe 
Ruth. What emerges amid considerable technical brilliance and wit is a rather 
distanced commentary about the perils of living a life in a goldfish bowl.

The networks wonder why they're losing viewers and the answer is simple: Too 
many shows have constant repeats! "thirtysomething" is one of the biggest 
offenders. When the story lines of programs are serialized, it's especially 
difficult for viewers to get back into the series after a few repeats. If the 
networks want a larger audience, they should order more episodes.

It's not enough to see Hal Fishman, Pat Lalama and Warren Olney (et al.) during 
almost every commercial break; we must also put up with a recap of a recap for 
a recap via those obtrusive boxes during the credits of movies shown on KTLA, 
KTTV and KCOP. 
</P>
<P>
Why? I don't know. It's the same news we heard 20 minutes earlier, most of 
which we're already aware of anyway. It's unfortunate enough that most films 
are cut. If that can't be helped, the stations at least can show their film 
libraries a little respect by giving the 10 o'clock newscasts a rest until 10 
o'clock.

A KINGDOM FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
BOB MILLER HAS SEEN L.A.'S HOCKEY TEAM TRY JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING -- AND NOTHING 
SEEMS TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During Bob Miller's 17-year tenure as the Kings' announcer, not even training 
camp was a time for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of years in my career when the season started there was no 
chance we could win the Stanley Cup," Miller said. "We'd be lucky to make the 
playoffs in some of those years." 
</P>
<P>
And making the National Hockey League playoffs isn't exactly tough. For the 
past 11 seasons, 16 of the league's 21 teams have advanced to the playoffs 
under the most charitable system in pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
But things figured to be different this year. 
</P>
<P>
Miller observed the Kings had a new attitude in September, when the team 
reported to training camp in Hull, Canada, after finishing second in the Smythe 
Division and fourth overall last season. The team was further buoyed by the 
prospects of a full season from goalie Kelly Hrudey and the free-agent signing 
of future Hall of Fame defenseman Larry Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"We went into this season with more optimism than any season I'd ever been 
involved with," Miller said. "There truly was the feeling this team could win 
the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
But what began for the Kings as a season with the most optimism in team history 
has become the most disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
The team has fallen to fourth place in the Smythe Division and will be decided 
underdogs against the defending Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames in the 
first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, which open Wednesday. Games continue 
Friday, Sunday and Tuesday, all on Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Miller blames the team's front office for the Kings' problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Through its history, this team has never seemed to have a plan to get where 
they're going to go and staying with that plan," Miller said. "When Jack Kent 
Cooke (who owned the team from its inception in 1967 until 1979) was here, the 
plan was to trade all the draft choices and get veterans. That didn't work and 
they scrapped that. Then they kept their draft choices, traded some other 
people and that didn't work. So a couple of years into what might be a 
five-year plan, they change again. 
</P>
<P>
"They brought Robbie Ftorek in here as coach because they had young players. 
Then they got Wayne Gretzky and changed again to having an older team, and that 
hasn't worked. 
</P>
<P>
"The best chance to win is with Wayne Gretzky here and surrounding him with the 
right kind of people. Thankfully, that's not my job, but it goes back to the 
scouts and the general manager (Rogie Vachon), who know more hockey than I do, 
to go out and find those players. The maddening thing is that you see other 
organizations-Edmonton's the prime example-trading someone the stature of a 
Gretzky, and two years later competing again for the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's journey to Los Angeles began in Iowa. After announcing the University 
of Iowa's football and basketball games for the school's student-run 
10,000-watt radio station, the Chicago native's first post-college job came as 
a newscaster for an Oelwein, Iowa, radio station in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was important to have a job when I graduated," Miller said. "I 
graduated on a Friday and started work on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
After four months in Oelwein, Miller was hired by WITI-TV in Milwaukee, first 
as a news reporter and later as a sportscaster. In 1964, Miller became sports 
director of WMTV in Madison, Wis. Seeking a return to play-by-play announcing, 
two years later, Miller joined WKOW radio and television in Madison, which 
carried the University of Wisconsin's games. 
</P>
<P>
After announcing football and basketball, Miller became a hockey announcer in 
1968, not out of design but of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the only sport on campus that was winning consistently and drawing 
standing-room-only crowds," Miller said. "The program director at the radio 
station came to me and told me we're doing hockey next Friday, and since you're 
the sports announcer, you're doing it. I'd never done a game before in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
In the small world department, Miller's first hockey broadcast partner was Ira 
Fistell, then teaching at Wisconsin and hosting a WKOW talk show. Fistell now 
hosts a KABC Radio talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Miller quickly found hockey to be much different from om er sports he had 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I did hockey, the more I found it was more challenging than any other 
play-by-play I had ever done," Miller said. "Football is structured more for 
radio. You have time to recap the play and set up the next play. You have a 
couple of spotters and a statistician and all kinds of help. Basketball, you 
have five guys, and they don't change until the whistle blows, and there are 
only six or seven guys who play all night, so that's fairly easy. 
</P>
<P>
"But in hockey, you're on your own. When they drop the puck, if you're not 
prepared and haven't done your homework, it's going to be very evident." 
</P>
<P>
Miller first sought to join the Kings in 1972, when the team's original 
announcer, Jiggs McDonald, left after five seasons to announce for the 
expansion Atlanta Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Venerable Lakers announcer Chick Hearn was in charge of finding a new 
announcer. Miller said, "I sent him a tape and talked with him. He told me he 
liked my stuff and would recommend me for the job." 
</P>
<P>
However, Cooke overrode Hearn's suggestion, hiring Roy Storey instead. But 
everything worked out for for Miller. Staying at Wisconsin, he broadcast the 
Badgers' 1973 NCAA hockey championship, the only title-winning team Miller has 
been involved with in his 30-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the word out of Los Angeles was Kings management was unhappy with 
Storey's work and would again be searching for an announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Miller sent in new tapes to Hearn. As luck would have it, Miller was in Chicago 
for a meeting when the Lakers were also there. 
</P>
<P>
"I waited around their hotel for about four hours, thinking, 'If I just could 
talk to Chick in person and let him know that I'm interested.' " Miller said. 
"I went up and introduced myself to him. It was only a meeting of five minutes. 
He said I think I might have something for you." 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Miller was offered the job. But while in Southern California 
to sign his contract, the Pittsburgh Penguins called Miller's home in 
Wisconsin, leaving word they wanted him to be their broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Chick was very gracious and told me to call Pittsburgh and find out what the 
deal was, and if it was a better one to take it. I always appreciated that 
attitude. It wasn't a better deal, and I'm very happy with the choice I made."

DEAD CALM 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Noyce's 1989 thriller is a spare, smart, seductive piece of real 
movie-making, with (almost) every loophole covered, a superlative cast 
andandough tension to keep us all hyperventilating for hours. Sam Neill and 
Nicole Kidman are on an extended South Pacific voyage when they cross paths 
with insinuating Billy Zane.

ZELIG 
</P>
<P>
This is a sweet, piercing, startlingly inventive film, a little rueful around 
the edges, in which Woody Allen fakes a documentary about one Leonard Zelig 
(played by Allen), who in his meteoric moment in the public eye stood somewhere 
between Charles Lindbergh and Babe Ruth. What emerges amid considerable 
technical brilliance and wit is a rather distanced commentary about the perils 
of living a life in a goldfish bowl.

THE SUN SETS ON 'MORNING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am deeply disappointed that "L.A. in the Morning" is no longer on KCAL. 
</P>
<P>
I was a loyal viewer for many years and was impressed with the needed attention 
this program continually gave to serious societal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
That this program, so well hosted by Stephanie Edwards, was removed is another 
nail in the coffin of a literate and informed society, as well as an informed 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
The authors, politicians and activists who appeared on "Midmorning L.A." (the 
show's previous title) and "L.A. in the Morning" were invaluable to my bank of 
information. I bemoan the loss of this program, and I know I am not alone.

CUTTING COMMENTS

<P>
In a recent movies column, it was suggested that viewers tape the original 
"Stella Dallas" with Barbara Stanwyck on KTTV. 
</P>
<P>
Having never seen it, I looked forward to viewing a classic. Thanks to my wife, 
a "Stella" expert, I know we saw one of the worst editing jobs ever.

BURNED BY BURR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perry Mason turned up once again with one of his plodding two-hour vehicles on 
March 11. If you're a fan of Raymond Burr, you could describe his acting as 
laid back and underplayed. 
</P>
<P>
If not, you could call it stilted, ponderous and boring. Whatever, "The Case of 
the Desperate Deception," which was filmed in Paris, seemed carelessly done. If 
Burr comes to life at all in this series of movies, it is usually during the 
trial scene. This time out, he couldn't manage that. Mason's secretary, Della, 
seemed uncaring about her few telephone scenes. And William Moses is no 
substitute for William Katt, who had pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
The Gargantuan gaffe of the film was Burr's line (misread, perhaps?): "The 
court-martial begins tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the morning." Can anyone recall 
when 10 a.m. came in the afternoon?

WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT CONGESTION ON CALIFORNIA 78 IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jake Dekema, 74, was for 25 years the director of transportation for an area 
that includes San Diego County. He lives in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It should have been widened long ago. I don't know what else they can do that 
they're not doing. They're going to widen it to six lanes, for which we 
provided the right-of-way many, many years ago. I don't think you can afford to 
widen it to eight lanes any more. 
</P>
<P>
The widening to six lanes should have been done long ago. The money just wasn't 
there in comparison to other projects in other parts of the state. It didn't 
have that high of a priority. But if it had been widened to six lanes when I 
asked for the money when I was still working, you wouldn't have the congestion 
problems during construction that you're bound to have today. 
</P>
<P>
It probably won't solve the problem, long term. I just don't think you can get 
enough capacity in that one road. What you need to do is put in Highway 76 as 
well. That will take some of the load off. (Highway 76 would run from Oceanside 
to Interstate 15 alongside the San Luis Rey River.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lee Thibadeau, 45, is in his fourth year as the mayor of San Marcos, which has 
a traffic management program. He has been on the San Marcos City Council since 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The best that could be done immediately is a traffic management program 
throughout North County. Unfortunately, the city of San Marcos is the only city 
in North County right now with a program. As soon as our neighbors join in, I 
think we'll see some major benefits from that. 
</P>
<P>
Initially what we need to try to do is get the employers cooperating and 
working toward some peak-hour traffic programs providing incentives and other 
vehicles to get their employees working on flex hours, modified work schedules, 
things like that. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of them could take a bus one or two days a week. A lot of people are 
unwilling to give up their cars; they want it there in case they want to go 
some place for lunch or whatever. The larger employers can make pool cars 
available. If you took a bus to work just one day a week you're going to cut 
down your contribution to traffic congestion during peak hours by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos -- and we're really the second city in the state to do this -- 
started a program a few years ago and had a lot of success, a lot of 
cooperation from the employers and employees. In fact, it becomes a benefit to 
the employee. City Hall, for example, rotates an additional day off. Our 
secretary in City Hall, I think it's about every third Friday she gets off. 
They call it her happy day. She gets a three-day weekend once every three weeks 
as a result of putting in an extra half hour a day or an hour a day to beat the 
peak-hour traffic, either to be ahead of it or behind it. 
</P>
<P>
That's a long-range solution that has to become a permanent program. What that 
can do for us is give us some immediate opportunities to cut down on 
congestion. It won't solve the long-term problem by itself, but it allows us 
some time and some breathing space while we build more of the facilities that 
are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The reason it has to be ongoing and long term, though, is you could build 12 
lanes on Highway 78 and in a short time they would all be filled up because 
people using the surface streets right now who are getting congestion would 
then see an opportunity to move faster on the freeway and move to the freeway. 
We don't have an adequate circulation plan within the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Ron Phulps, 43, was promoted from lieutenant to captain for the 
California Highway Patrol in late 1989. He spent three years in charge of 
transportation planning for the CHP in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I don't know that a whole lot can be done. We in Highway Patrol are doing what 
we can do. As of last year, we assigned five motorcycles to Highway 78. That 
was the first time in years we've had motorcycles, and we're trying to get a 
few more because of the lack of shoulders and the construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
That's what we're facing in all of our urban, congested areas in the state, and 
the fact that Caltrans is forced to provide additional lanes without 
necessarily having additional right-of-way. Therefore, in order to do that, 
sometimes they have to cut the shoulders off the freeway and we lose our 
working environment. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing that we're doing right now is a program we call operation 
CLEAR. That stands for Clearing Lanes Efficiently and Rapidly. We focused on 
Highway 78, between Mar Vista and I-15, and during peak commute hours in the 
morning and afternoon we have redeployed two additional people who have beat 
responsibilities elsewhere within the Oceanside command. We've deployed them 
onto the 9-mile segment of freeway to simply keep traffic moving -- to remove 
impediments, whether it's debris on the roadway or disabled vehicles on the 
shoulders. Just to get all of those impediments and visual hazards off the 
freeway in order to get traffic rolling. 
</P>
<P>
If there are accidents, at the scene we have a policy of just getting bare 
essential information and moving those vehicles off the freeway and taking care 
of business out of sight of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, we're hoping to further develop the concept of having freeway 
tow trucks, which are owned and operated by the Highway Patrol, painted a 
distinctive color. The drivers would be employees and we would have radio 
communication between our patrol officers and tow truck drivers and the tow 
truck drivers would then have that routine patrol assignment of removing things 
as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Pfeiffer, 51, has worked for the North County Transit District since its 
inception in 1976. He was named executive director in 1979. He is 51, lives in 
Encinitas, and occasionally takes the bus to work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well one of the things that can be done is to educate and get more people 
utilizing public transportation -- car pools and van pools, working with our 
transportation management association. So what it boils down to is people have 
to start thinking in terms of more occupancy per auto than one person -- 
whether it be the car pool, van pool, or public transit. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of ways (to get people thinking like this). One is to work 
with the major employers, whether it be colleges, schools, your major 
electronics manufacturers, etc. You need to get in and work through the 
personnel directors of the various agencies. You can go in and show them the 
benefits. One of the ways that you get to a young person is money -- everybody 
is concerned about bucks. If you can show a college student the amount of money 
that can be saved by car-pooling or van-pooling and riding buses versus what it 
costs to operate their car. And when you have a limited amount of money and 
they can see the amount they could save by using a different method of 
transportation, they then can take the money saved and use it for tuition, 
partying, whatever they choose to do. 
</P>
<P>
We have an active Transit Management Assn. in North County and that really is 
their role, to educate the people. 
</P>
<P>
What I wish I could say is use alternate routes. The unfortunate thing is we 
really do not have any other surface streets that are good alternate routes.

THE BUILDING OF LAKE SAN MARCOS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE VISIONARY RETIREMENT COMMUNITY PIONEERED MANY OF THE CONCEPTS THAT 
HAVE BECOME STANDARDS IN THE HOUSING INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On paper, there were few apparent reasons back in 1963 why Gordon Frazar's new 
housing development in North County should top the List of Sure Bets. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a residential project built around a former agricultural pond, down the 
street from a county garbage dump, midway between interstates 5 and 15 -- in 
the center of everything but close to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only identify and prove the true visionary by the number of skeptics 
and cynics that surround him, and Gordon Frazar was surrounded," real estate 
analyst Sanford Goodkin once said of Frazar's notion of the new neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics and cynics no longer, though. 
</P>
<P>
Frazar, better known at the time for building 6,000 tract homes in Riverside 
County, fathered Lake San Marcos, a 1,500-acre, $56-million project that opened 
in 1963 and now is just 100 homes shy of its 2,400-home limit. The retirement 
community surrounds two golf courses and an 80-acre man-made lake, where bass 
and blue heron are as much at home as pontoons puttering around at happy hour. 
</P>
<P>
This is where some of the nation's first condominiums were built and sold. And 
where some of Southern California's first underground utilities and cable 
television lines were installed for residents. 
</P>
<P>
And let there be no doubt about the intended age group for this place. 
Recreation Director Billy Nardella oversees the fishing and casting club, the 
newcomers club, the yacht club, the mixed bridge club, the racquet club, the 
art league, and the slide and travel group. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly the stuff to attract families with young children or teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
At the recreation center, residents have their choice of four tennis courts, 
two swimming pools, three paddle ball courts, billiard tables and a party room, 
with kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 4,000 residents, many of them single, live here. The average cost 
of a single, detached home is $278,000. The community's centerpiece is the 
1.3-mile-long lake that had its genesis as an agricultural pond; a previous 
landowner dammed San Marcos Creek with a 50-foot-high concrete wall so he could 
water his onion, tomato and walnut crops year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Frazar dredged the pond, making it wider and deeper, and created numerous 
inlets. The lake now covers 80 acres. 
</P>
<P>
One of the keys to Frazar's success was building most of the development's 
amenities before he started selling homes. 
</P>
<P>
He opened a motel, which now has 142 rooms, and an adjacent restaurant -- the 
Quails Inn, which is as popular for its buffets as for its commanding view of 
the lake. The lake was finished and stocked; one of two golf courses was 
teasing duffers; and the neighborhood shopping center was open, selling 
everything from women's fashions to greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Frazar offered a package -- so prospective buyers could see what 
they were buying without guessing what phases II or III would bring -- 
generated quick sales. 
</P>
<P>
When Charles Hahne, security patrol supervisor of Lake San Marcos, moved to the 
site from Chicago with his wife 25 years ago, it had just 300 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Hahne said he was attracted to the area because of its safety, friendliness and 
family atmosphere. All still hold true, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife says she's going to heaven and this is the first stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hahnes have even persuaded relatives and friends to move to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife's sister moved here a few years ago, and she brought in three or four 
girlfriends who moved here," Hahne said. "Some of our friends from Chicago have 
retired here, too." 
</P>
<P>
Frazar's "total package" also makes Lake San Marcos a convenient place to live, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have everything we need here. It's not necessary to go far to get much." 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the residents live in the community year-round; the balance are 
snowbirds who escape the winter of the northern states and Canada, prefering 
ice in their drinks to ice on their ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Frazar did buck the trend adopted by most new housing developments: He shunned 
the creation of homeowners' associations and instead formed his own Citizens 
Development Corp., to which homeowners pay an optional annual fee for the use 
of the lake and other amenities. The CDC owns it all -- right down to the fish 
in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC also wields architectural control, preventing new homes from blocking 
views of the lake and making sure that houses are the requisite California 
ranch or Spanish style. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by the city of San Marcos, Lake San Marcos is an unincorporated 
county island; residents have never leaned toward incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
It was only because of George Frazar's track record -- or lack of it -- as a 
builder that this project became Lake San Marcos versus, say, Lake Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Frazar first approached Orange County's Irvine Co. to build his project there, 
but they rejected his idea because he had never built something that large. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be thwarted, he persuaded his favorite banker to back him in San Marcos.

WHAT DOES NORTH COUNTY MOST NEED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John MacDonald, 68, has lived in Oceanside since 1949. He has been the county 
supervisor representing North County since 1987. He is the retired president of 
MiraCosta College, and he served on the Oceanside City Council for four years. 
</P>
<P>
North County needs to develop a regional cohesiveness, which will provide the 
opportunity for us to look ahead at long-range goals. 
</P>
<P>
North County has grown so rapidly, and individual cities have different goals. 
We really haven't had a chance to take a long-range look at the area. That 
needs to be done and will be one of my goals in the next year: to gather 
together a group of the people who have knowledge of the North County business, 
industry and education to see if we can't come up with a set of long-range 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
The North County is the fastest growing area in the entire county now, and most 
of the growth is in migration from the north, from Orange County and Los 
Angeles County. As a result, we have a lot of new people in the area who need 
to be involved in taking a look at the future. As an example, there were about 
38,000 registered voters in 5th District who will vote in this election who 
were not registered when I ran in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
We do have some well-thought-out general plans for the cities in the North 
County, and they have done a lot to modify the rate of growth and to improve 
the quality of life and the quality of growth in the cities. But we really have 
not had a chance to sit down and say what we want to see for the North County 
in the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, we need to address as a region the industrial and economic 
development needs of the North County. North County has been somewhat of a 
bedroom community for San Diego and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. We have 
people driving to San Diego to work in great numbers; we have people driving 
and taking the train to Los Angeles and Orange County in great numbers. We need 
to develop our regional economic and job base. 
</P>
<P>
I think we also need to take a look at preserving some of the open space that, 
as time goes on, will shrink. 
</P>
<P>
We need to tie the general plans of the cities and the county together so that 
it is a unified long-range look at a most beautiful area. One of the things we 
have done to lay the groundwork for this is to bring the mayors of the cities 
of the 5th District together to work on a number of regional problems. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the cities have worked together to help fund the widening of 
Highway 78. They have cooperated to develop regional traffic demand management 
programs. And most recently they have come together to work on a regional 
approach to the needs of the homeless. So we do have the climate for what I 
think is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the things we do in government are reactive rather than proactive, and 
I hope we can sit down and look at a proactive plan for North County. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lounsbery, 50, is vice president and general counsel of Lusardi 
Construction. He is a former city attorney and city manager in Escondido and 
has also worked for the San Diego city attorney's office and in private 
practice. The Escondido resident has lived in North County since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I think many people will say that we must solve the problems of waste 
recycling, transportation, water shortages, crime and all the other problems 
North County residents associate with growth. It's my opinion that those issues 
are being addressed and that they will be resolved -- not easily, but they will 
be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
North County has the land area, the climate and the will of its people to solve 
those problems. Technologically and politically, we are going to face them. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to minimize them. But I think there are two supervening issues, 
which are cited with less regularity because they are more difficult to 
address. 
</P>
<P>
First, I believe it is critical for North County to encourage a positive 
educational environment. If there is one asset that just must be nurtured, it 
is the education of our populace. I realize this is also a statewide issue, but 
I think it requires a very special resolve at a local level. 
</P>
<P>
And that leads to a second issue that more directly addresses the personality 
of North County. By encouraging our local education prerogatives, we encourage 
our young people to stay in North County. What I fear is that we are becoming 
the home of the wealthy retirees and the playground of the rich and famous. And 
I dread the thought that we would lose the vitality and the variety that young 
people, and the retention of our young people, assures North County. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I am so enthused about Cal State San Marcos. That's why I believe in 
the merits of local education. But it must start even earlier than that. I 
can't imagine a more important asset than the value of all our young people. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, we need to talk about funding at the state level. And we need to address 
it there. But I think at the corporate level, in the home, at the municipal and 
the district level, we have to address these educational prerogatives. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not talking about creating an environment where everybody goes to college. 
I think that should be encouraged as well, but we also have a tremendous asset 
in our technological fields for non-college graduates. 
</P>
<P>
I do know one thing. I see the educational values of other Pacific Rim 
countries, and I would hate to lose all the value we have in our youth who are 
just as smart and just as bright and just as capable. 
</P>
<P>
The advent of Cal State San Marcos will bring with it younger people with 
younger ideas, not to mention their educators, who are known to bring different 
ideas to a community. And I think that is very healthy. 
</P>
<P>
It keeps us from becoming what I think we have already begun to take pride in: 
the idea that we are sort of better than the rest of the county. A lot of North 
County folks are very much imbued with the idea of "Look at us -- we have 
Rancho Santa Fe, we are Pauma Valley, we are La Costa, we are Fairbanks." 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon we start believing all that rhetoric. But we are a lot more than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Randall L. Mitchell, 69, retired from the Marine Corps in 1963. He owns a 
public relations firm and is active in the community. He lives in Oceanside and 
has been a North County resident since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We have two things that stand out as needs in North County, probably neither of 
which is unique to us at all. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, of course, has to do with the homeless, because there are an awful 
lot of people in this area who don't have any place to go, no place to live and 
hardly any way to take care of themselves. There are a number of those people 
who shouldn't be on the streets, period. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of the issue are the undocumented people who hang out along El 
Camino Real and other places waiting for employment in the morning. When they 
are employed, it is not legal to do so. Something should be done to control 
them, perhaps find an opportunity for them to be registered correctly and made 
available for labor if that's what they want to do. I think those are the two 
big pressing things. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of other things I'd like to see up here. I think we are sorely 
in need of a stronger cultural movement here in the northwest corner of the 
county, and some of us are working toward that end and hope we can do something 
about it in the foreseeable future. Take Oceanside, for example, and even 
Carlsbad and Vista. I think there is just not the opportunity to enjoy some of 
the finer things in life that you can get in the larger metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
We have such an elderly group of people in this area who find it difficult to 
travel to San Diego -- almost impossible to travel to Los Angeles to enjoy 
plays, art of all kinds, museums and these kinds of things. It's just not easy 
for them to get there, and I think we need those cultural amenities up here. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Stewart Pohlman, 43, has been executive director of the Escondido-based 
North County Interfaith Council, one of the largest social service agencies in 
the county, since it opened eight years ago. She lives in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
I think there is a cluster of related problems . . . that all impact and are 
impacted by divorce, unemployment, poor child rearing, lack of child care, a 
poor educational system, dropouts, drug addiction and pregnancy and on and on 
and on. It is important to apply resources to this cluster in a way that treats 
the system as a whole, instead of piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
The availability of affordable housing is certainly a huge issue. What North 
County most needs are emergency shelter beds for intact families. We need that 
desperately. And we don't have enough housing for mentally ill, homeless women. 
I have a young woman in the hospital now with possible tuberculosis and 
pneumonia, and two mentally ill women were raped on the streets recently, and 
all this is happening because there are not enough beds. What we really need, 
plain and simple, is beds. 
</P>
<P>
It's a national disgrace and certainly a local one, too, and it demeans us to 
ask for something so pitiful and so basic as shelter, beds and food for folks 
whose basic needs are not being met. We have at least 18,000 migrants in the 
hills without housing -- although the word migrants is kind of a misnomer now, 
because they are "almost-to-be-citizens." They are real proud of their 
opportunity to be here and to direct their own destiny and to make something 
special here. 
</P>
<P>
I was a social worker when the Vietnamese arrived and I worked at Camp 
Pendleton because I spoke a little French. At that time, the whole community 
seemed to open up and embrace the immigrants and whole families were adopted. 
If we treated the homeless as we did the new immigrants, they would be absorbed 
into the church community in much the same fashion, and whole families would be 
nurtured and supported and assisted in job search through a smaller community. 
Then they would be naturally integrated into the greater community as they grew 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Taylor, 74, was on the San Diego County Board of Supervisors from 1973 to 
1979. He is a retired contractor whose company helped build San Diego's sewer 
and water system. He lives in Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What North County needs most is additional roads to match our growth. The major 
mistake that has been made over the years is not planning a transportation 
system that would handle the number of people that moved in. The roads need to 
be in up front. They should be built before the houses are. 
</P>
<P>
As an affluent society, we have drifted into one person to a car, and we may 
have to drift away from it or the people following us may. I can't see this 
going on indefinitely the way it is. Otherwise we are looking at gridlock. I 
think the gas tax increase on the June ballot is a must. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, we are going to run into a water shortage here. We're still 
building frantically and no more water is coming in. There need to be some big 
changes in the amount of water people use. There are so many things that can be 
done. For one thing, we have huge houses being built here -- much bigger than 
what people really need. The major problem with that is the consumption of 
energy and water, especially water. 
</P>
<P>
Our local water supply amounts to only about 10% of what we use. We have to 
bring in the water, and that source is becoming more and more overloaded all 
the time. I'd like to see some conservation measures. 
</P>
<P>
In our sewage disposal systems, an awful lot of water is wasted. There are many 
systems . . . on boats and in motor homes that use a lot less water. . . . 
Water reclamation plants are a must at some time. We are shipping about 200 
million gallons off Point Loma every day, most of which could be reused. But 
the best way, by my reasoning, is not to get the water dirty in the first 
place. That's easier than cleaning it up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking very far down the road, there will have to be some real 
drastic things, because we just don't have the water to keep going the way we 
are going. 
</P>
<P>
BIGGEST PROBLEMS 
</P>
<P>
North County residents see the top problems in their area differently from 
those of the county as a whole. Drugs are the county's biggest problem, they 
say, while the topic doesn't emerge among the top three problems for North 
County.

LONGTIME RESIDENTS MORE LIKELY TO BE UPSET BY AREA'S FAST GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
TIMES POLL: DECLINING QUALITY OF LIFE AND CRIME ARE KEY ISSUES FOR THEM, WHILE 
NEWCOMERS ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH HIGH HOUSING COSTS.

<P>
Perhaps more than any other factor, perceptions about life in North County -- 
what's good about it, and what's bad about it -- are colored by how long that 
person has lived here. 
</P>
<P>
With some exceptions, a Los Angeles Times Poll has found that those who have 
lived in North County for more than 20 years are the ones who are souring on 
the area the most. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers are about half as likely to say that the quality of life in the 
county has improved during the past decade as newcomers -- people who have 
lived in the area for five years or less. More dramatically, a majority of 
old-timers -- by a 4-to-1 margin -- say the quality of life in San Diego County 
has worsened, versus improved, over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, fewer than 4 newcomers out of 10 see life getting worse in San 
Diego County -- probably either because they haven't been around long enough to 
notice insidious changes for the worse, or because they're what the old-timers 
are complaining about. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newcomers is 23-year-old Shelly Carter, who moved to Solana Beach 
from Santa Barbara two years ago so she could attend classes at San Diego State 
University -- and who now has no plans on leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the place for me," she proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
She cites the sun, the beach, her new-found friends -- and the fact there are 
more business opportunities here than back home in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be careful about growth because it brings problems -- especially 
environmental ones," she says. "But you need growth to flourish. There's more 
of a future here." 
</P>
<P>
But old-timers -- the folks who have been around long enough to see the 
character of North County change -- are finding that the new character, more 
urban and urbane, isn't what they want. 
</P>
<P>
Custom home builder Con Slack lived in Vista for 18 years before moving four 
years ago to Fallbrook. He talks about how his values contrast with those who 
are just now arriving in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"They're more 'me' oriented," he grouses. "It's 'I this' and 'I that' and they 
only speak about their problems, not our problems. They're the ones who call 
the sheriff for a small complaint so he can't get to the person who has a real 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"And they seem to be producing 'wannabe' kids who want to be able to do this or 
that right now, and kids who deal in drugs and booze and all other chemical 
stimulants. They're infecting our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Like Slack, other longtime residents are nearly three times more likely than 
newcomers to say they chose their community for a rural lifestyle -- a 
lifestyle they find diminishing in North County as one-time open space is lost 
to housing to accommodate the newcomers. Not surprisingly, then, they are more 
than twice as likely as newcomers to say their community no longer holds the 
attraction that first drew them. 
</P>
<P>
And because they have watched their rural landscapes shrink and their towns 
fill with new apartments and housing tracts, they are three times more likely 
than newcomers to complain that growth is what they like least about their 
community. Newcomers might feel more sheepish in complaining about growth, of 
course; they are the ones who most recently have caused it. Others say that 
growth ensures a better, more well-rounded community, and that's good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Sugarland, Tex., and in Texas everyone mainly thinks about one thing: 
oil," says John Habegger, a 22-year-old lance corporal in the Marine Corps who 
is attending MiraCosta College in Oceanside. He hopes to eventually earn a 
degree in business and perhaps settle down here. 
</P>
<P>
"When oil goes down, so does the economy. But San Diego is branching out a lot, 
and that's the reason San Diego is doing so well, with growth and new 
businesses bringing in still more money to the community. That brings more 
people, and the more people you bring, the broader horizons there are for still 
more and different businesses and that creates a better situation for 
everyone," Habegger said. 
</P>
<P>
On some counts, longtime residents are happier than newcomers with life in 
North County. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, 73% of those who have lived in North County longer than 20 years 
have some or a lot of confidence in the local schools; by contrast, only 57% of 
the newcomers have that same confidence. 
</P>
<P>
And two-thirds of the old-timers believe San Diego's beaches are safe for 
swimming; in contrast, only 44% of the newcomers do. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers and old-timers agree that the biggest problem facing the county 
overall is drugs. But newcomers, who most recently were confronted with the 
current housing market, say affordable housing is the second biggest problem 
facing the county. Old-timers list traffic as the second greatest problem. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents -- whether because many of them are older, more frail and 
feel more vulnerable, or because they remember the days when fewer strangers 
walked their neighborhoods -- see North County as a more dangerous place to 
live than do the recent arrivals. Among old-timers, only 64% feel safe to walk 
the streets of their neighborhood at night, while 81% of the newcomers feel 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difference in opinions and lifestyles might stem from demographics 
-- including one of the most basic of all: 59% of the old-timers are 40 or 
older; 59% of the newcomers are younger than 40. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers are almost three times as likely to be renters: 44% compared with 15% 
for old-timers. But the newcomers to North County nonetheless pay more for 
housing: 27% are paying $1,000 or more in monthly rental or mortgage, while 14% 
of the old-timers are paying those kinds of prices. 
</P>
<P>
Some people who rent -- like Ardiss Morgan -- say they'll never buy a home 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, a computer data technician for a San Marcos publisher, and her 
truck-driver husband, Dennis, transplanted themselves 3 1/2 years ago to Vista 
from Clinton, Iowa. They were attracted here by the climate and job 
opportunities, but they don't figure on staying here long. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ever going to own a house out here," she said. "These prices are too 
outrageous. We'd like to move to Atlanta, Ga. The houses are priced right 
there, and besides, in Atlanta it's green all year round." 
</P>
<P>
But like Morgan and her husband, newcomers to North County are more likely to 
be double-income households than old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime North County residents are less likely to be professional or 
white-collar workers than newcomers -- but, on the other hand, they are more 
likely than newcomers to be executives, administrators or owners of their own 
business. 
</P>
<P>
They also are more likely to be Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, virtually all old-timers claim U.S. citizenship; among newcomers 
to the county, nearly a fifth are not U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it is because they've seen the changing ethnicity of North County over 
the years; old-timers are more likely than newcomers to say that the Latino 
lifestyle has changed San Diego County for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
And, like Escondido resident Dale Robertson, they are twice as likely to say 
that the main effect of recent immigration has been increased crime. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up here," said Robertson, who has lived in Escondido for 27 
of his 29 years, "I was able to leave the keys in my car and the front door of 
my house unlocked. Now you see all the migrant workers everywhere and you're 
hesitant, you know? I'm not blaming them, but they might get desperate and you 
might be a victim. 
</P>
<P>
"That's especially true on (construction) job sites. I'm working my butt off, 
and go back to my truck and something's gone and you know it's not one of your 
fellow workers because they've been working as hard as you. It's the illegal 
aliens standing around who see you leave your truck and they walk up and grab 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Not only are longtime residents more likely than newcomers to bear a grudge 
against Latinos, they're less sympathetic toward them in schooling and living 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of old-timers dislike the notion of teaching some public school 
classes in Spanish -- primarily because it would take funds away from other 
educational programs. By contrast, one in three newcomers opposes teaching some 
classes in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the old-timers support the notion of government providing housing 
and food for migrant workers -- the alternative being to raze the migrant camps 
altogether and drive them elsewhere. But more newcomers -- 60% -- support 
government help for the migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't immigrants find more friends among longtime North County residents? 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Martinez, who has studied migrant issues for 10 years on behalf of the 
American Friends Service Committee, suggests that negative images -- including, 
in this case, ones about the impact of migrants -- make stronger and 
longer-lasting impressions than do positive images. 
</P>
<P>
Ergo, he says, the longer one has lived here, the more likely one has read and 
heard -- and retained -- negative reports about immigrants, while the positive 
contributions are more easily forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer people live here and are exposed to the Latino community and 
migrant workers, the more they've formed biased opinions based either on 
misinformation or myth," Martinez says. "The newcomers haven't been here long 
enough to be affected that way." 
</P>
<P>
TAKING THE LONG VIEW 
</P>
<P>
Oldtimers in North County take a dimmer view of recent changes than do 
newcomers. People who have lived in the county more than 20 years are more 
likely to have chosen their community for its rural setting; and, as rural 
settings have been disappearing, they are far more likely to say that growth is 
the worst aspect of their community. Newcomers tend more to feel safe in their 
neighborhoods and to feel that the county's quality of life has improved in the 
past decade.

WHY LEAVE? 
</P>
<P>
Longtimers in North County naturally have put down deeper roots. As a result, 
they are far less likely to foray northward. And they are more likely to think 
of North County as a community of its own, with common interests.

FINANCIAL SQUEEZE

<P>
Newcomers to North County pay more money each month for housing yet have lower 
incomes than longtime residents. Little wonder they are more likely to identify 
affordable housing as San Diego County's biggest problem.

DESPITE GROWTH, RAMONA CLINGS TO SMALL-TOWN WAYS 
</P>

Where exactly is Ramona? The pamphlet from the Chamber of Commerce puts it this 
way: "Below the snow line, above the smog line, in the Valley of the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
To get to it, take California 67 North, away from the clutter and traffic jams 
of city life and into a community of feed stores and specialty shops for guns, 
knives and belt buckles. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona is a small town that is starting to become a big one. Mary Kay Pinkard 
of the Chamber of Commerce is responsible for taking the census, and she 
figured out quite a while ago that it doesn't pay to put exact numbers on 
population signs. They are too quickly outdated. In 1978, when the population 
was 12,000, she had the signs marked at 12,600 to allow for the rapid growth. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to have to do it again the very next day," said Pinkard, who was 
born in Ramona in 1918 and has lived there all her life. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the population of Ramona has almost tripled, to 35,000. With three 
elementary schools, a junior high and a high school, it is the fastest-growing 
unincorporated town in San Diego County, said Eunice Tanjuaquio of the San 
Diego Assn. of Governments. The school district had to hire 20 new teachers on 
the first day of classes last fall because of the unexpected number of new 
students. With the continued improvements in road conditions on California 67, 
Ramona has become a fairly simple commute from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramona used to be a very, very tough place to get to," said Charles Le 
Manager, author of a recently released book titled "Ramona and Round About" and 
a former state director of Housing and Community Development (1967-70). "You 
would get behind a truck in Lakeside and you'd stay there until you got to 
Ramona. It was terrible. Whenever you improve the road, that just invites more 
people to come up." 
</P>
<P>
Le Manager is partially responsible for the rapid growth. In 1970, after he 
resigned from his position with the state, he helped plan Ramona's San Diego 
Country Estates, a 3,250-acre housing development approved for 3,456 units. The 
project was approved in 1971, and the first houses, all custom built, were sold 
in 1972. According to Le Manager, sales were slow until the mid-1980s, and the 
project is now 80% full. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona was founded in 1886 by land speculator Milton Santee and named after a 
novel by Helen Hunt Jackson about relations between Mexicans and Indians. At 
that time, Ramona's 700 acres were inhabited by about 500 people. Santee sold 2 
acres of land for $100 to Amos J. Verlaque, who built the town's first store 
and post office. 
</P>
<P>
Since its early days, Ramona's biggest industry has been chicken and turkey 
farming. Eggs for breeding were distributed widely around the United States 
until 1959, when bigger companies cornered the market. Today, there are still 
four chicken ranches, each with about 450,000 laying hens, as well as rabbit 
and cattle ranches. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona once was a popular spot for dairy ranches, but, because of rising land 
prices, only three remain. It was also once known for its rich honey, produced 
from a host of apiaries and sold as far away as Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado orchards are sprinkled throughout Ramona and the rest of the valley, 
but freezes during the past three seasons have destroyed harvests and longtime 
growers have been forced to switch to other sources of income. Dave Galusha, a 
grower since 1972, cut his crop from 500 to 100 acres after a freeze in 
January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"With these freezes hitting back to back, it takes a couple of years to 
recover," said Galusha, who now teaches school part time. "Meanwhile, the cost 
of water is skyrocketing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hardships, growers have kept their sense of humor and formed an 
organization called Avocados Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take a notion of planting another avocado tree, you're supposed to call 
up another member," Galusha said. "They'll come over and drink with you until 
the notion passes." 
</P>
<P>
Included among Ramona's attractions is the Guy B. Woodward Museum, just off 
Main Street in the Verlaque House, built in 1886 by a Frenchman named Theophile 
Verlaque, Amos' father. The Verlaque House was converted to the museum in 1985, 
complete with rooms decorated in the style of early Ramona homes. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona is perhaps best known for Fred Grand Arena, home of the annual Ramona 
Rodeo/Casey Tibbs Roundup, which attracts top-ranked riders from around the 
country. Tibbs, a two-time world champion and longtime resident of Ramona, died 
of cancer Jan. 28. He founded Ramona's first bronco riding school, where Steve 
Ford, son of former President Gerald Ford, was once a student. Fred Grand Arena 
is also the site of Ramona's dog and horse shows and the Ramona Country Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Other recreational activities with a distinct Ramona flavor are fishing -- 
there are seven lakes within half an hour's drive -- archery, and horse 
auctions held every Friday and Saturday night at the Auction Barn. 
</P>
<P>
Listed in several magazines as one of the country's best places to retire, 
Ramona has only a handful of tract homes. Houses are primarily ranch style, 
built with a wood frame and stucco. Prices range from about $125,000 to 
$350,000. Houses surrounded by an acre or more of land and set up with horse 
stables are commonly priced from $180,000 to $230,000.

WHAT IS NORTH COUNTY'S TOP ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Harmon, 46, spent most of his 18 years on the Escondido City Council as 
the sole slow-growth advocate until two like-minded candidates were elected in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we have two, and it's both water and air. Water from the standpoint 
that since we live in the desert, this entire region is dependent on imported 
water. As the population increases, we become even more dependent. And as a 
result, I think we are reaching a point where we need to seriously consider the 
recycling and reclaiming of water. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido is on the verge of getting into that in a very meaningful way, in 
that probably in the next few weeks we will be making decisions regarding the 
expansion of our waste water treatment plant, and we are planning to not only 
expand it, but also to go to full tertiary treatment to meet state standards, 
which is not being done any place in the county at the moment. And by doing so, 
we will be in a position to use all of the water that is currently now dumped 
into the ocean at San Elijo. We will be able to sell that for irrigation and 
agricultural purposes, thus relieving the demand on potable water that is 
imported, and at the same time, creating a new income stream from the reclaimed 
water that we will be selling. 
</P>
<P>
Every day that goes by, we throw away 16 million gallons. We could be selling 
that at two-thirds the cost of what we paid for to bring it into the region in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
It does take time because obviously there are health considerations involved, 
there are engineering considerations in terms of how do you distribute the 
water. Because it's one thing to reclaim it. And that's a important point when 
you talk to other people who may say that trash is an environmental problem. 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing to say that, well, we are quote, recycling our trash, and that 
that's a way to deal with trash. But if you think about it, recycling is a bit 
of a misnomer unless you have complete loop. It's one thing to collect and 
separate trash, but that's only part of the process of recycling. Unless you 
have a market to reuse that trash that has been collected and separated, you 
really haven't completed the loop as far as recycling is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
And what I'm saying is also true with water. Unless you can market the water, 
and you have to be able to distribute it in order to do that, you haven't 
completed the loop. In the case of water, you have to make sure you do the 
whole process or you can't do any of it. 
</P>
<P>
I think that other areas that have treatment facilities are going to find that 
what we do will be to their benefit as well, for the same reasons, and that 
they too, once they take a closer look at it, they will be motivated to do the 
same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Erwin, 47, holds licenses as a real estate broker and commercial aircraft 
pilot, but has been in semiretirement since the air traffic controller's strike 
in 1981. Erwin, 47, has lived in Carlsbad since 1979, and serves on its 
planning commission and oversight committee for growth management. He has been 
fighting the San Marcos trash plant almost full time for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The control and management of growth. That's it in a nutshell. Our issues are 
peripherally tied to that. Our problems are all tied. How we in North County 
choose to manage our growth will dictate the problems that we have or the lack 
of problems that we have in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad has a growth management plan that overall is a terrific plan. These 
are the items that have to be satisfied along with any development in our 
community. We have our community broken into zones. There has to be overall 
zone plans for each area, addressing development through build-out and how they 
will satisfy these different areas as follows, not necessarily by importance: 
</P>
<P>
City administrative facilities, libraries, waste water treatment capacity, 
parks, drainage, circulation, fire department, open space, schools, sewer 
collection, and water distribution. 
</P>
<P>
That's what we have to address, and any time that anyone comes in with any 
project, that project has to be keyed into this and they have to show how all 
of those areas will be satisfied. That way we don't all of a sudden wake up one 
morning with major problems. Every segment has to grow in concert with the 
other segments. We don't overbuild and then say, gee, we forgot to have open 
space, or gee, we forgot to have parks, or gee, we forgot to have schools. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing we're going to have to address ourselves to pretty soon, which is 
a non-growth issue, is that over 90% of our water is imported. If we lose our 
water source through some emergency, we would be in a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Carlsbad keeps a two-week supply of water. We have some communities in 
North County, I understand, that have less than two-days supply of water 
available to them. This is a major problem that we're going to have to address 
because that 90%-plus water that's imported all comes across the San Andreas 
fault. If we were to have a major shift on that fault, we could lose our water 
supply, it is projected, up to six months. As far as long-range planning, that 
is a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentally, although I have concerns, I know we have enough good people 
fighting the good fight, that I don't see any great problems happening. Because 
any time anything starts to happen, we have so many people that pounce on it. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the SDG&amp;E expansion project down here. Because of what 
happened in Alaska and what happened in Huntington Beach, there was already a 
call for a possible ordinance in the city of Carlsbad for any ship that comes 
in to refuel at the SDG&amp;E plant, that they have to be a double-hulled 
vessel. We have so many people that pounce on this stuff so fast, that I'm not 
real concerned about us missing something there. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Aker is vice president of regulatory affairs for the Pacific Treatment 
Corp., a company that treats hazardous waste. He formerly worked with the 
toxics division of the county Health Services Department. He is a resident of 
Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
 Contaminated or abandoned sites in North County. That's my primary area of 
expertise. If we limit the discussion to contaminated or abandoned sites in the 
county, the Chatham site, in south Escondido, is clearly the most complex, the 
most polluted, the most studied site in the county. 
</P>
<P>
It is actually significant because it's a detriment to the development of the 
immediate neighbor and could be, I guess -- scratch the I guess -- could be a 
potential threat to anyone who's on the site and certainly is one that is 
continuing to pollute ground water. We need to qualify it and say that's 
there's never been any evidence to indicate that it represents a threat to any 
humans off site. But just simply because there are places where one could 
actually come into contact with the pollutants on site, it remains a threat 
actually to public health to anyone on site. 
</P>
<P>
It's of particular interest right now too, because the state and the community 
are facing a May 8 deadline, a regulatory deadline, that would mean that if the 
site has not been substantially cleaned up by May 8, then the cost of cleaning 
the site up will be much, much higher. 
</P>
<P>
The third phase of the federal regulations on hazardous waste, banning the 
landfilling of certain materials, goes into effect. What that means, is the 
cost of disposal after May 8, for the types of materials at that site, will be 
much much higher. So while the state has devoted about 1.2 million dollars and 
then they got some additional money after that, to work on the site, that money 
is going to be inadequate if they wait until after May 8. I think the state, 
when they were down at a community meeting about two weeks ago, had notified 
the community of the need to move rapidly on the site. 
</P>
<P>
There is another site in North County besides Chatham that deserves some 
mention and that's the ground water in Santa Ysabel . . . has also been 
contaminated from underground tanks. Because of the ground water contamination, 
the dependence of some of the people in the community on ground water, as their 
source for both drinking water and domestic use -- actually it's a fairly small 
contaminated plume -- is really significant in that community. 
</P>
<P>
Most of North County is not dependent on ground water for its domestic water 
use, we use imported water. But in Santa Ysabel, they are dependent, or they 
were in the past, dependent on ground water. So there are some wells there that 
have been condemned, and essentially a moratorium on new well drilling in that 
area because of the contaminated water. 
</P>
<P>
A third thing needs to be mentioned, a third area of contamination and that's 
all over North County. There are numerous, literally hundreds of sites that 
have been contaminated with gasoline or with diesel from underground fuel 
tanks. The county is going through a process right now of requiring, via state 
law, that they be cleaned up. In most cases, the only thing that's contaminated 
is soil, and so it doesn't pose any kind of a problem. In some cases, there is 
ground water contamination, but no dependency on ground water, so they don't 
really represent an acute issue. 
</P>
<P>
The perspective on all of this ought to be that North County is actually free 
from very many significant abandoned hazardous waste problems, due, in part, to 
the fact that they've been cleaned up over the past 10 years. The county has 
maintained a very active program, industry has really gotten behind the notion 
of cleaning up. 
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of sites that have been cleaned up can be documented. They really 
represent a substantial effort in North County to clean sites up. Certainly 
that doesn't say that we need to diminish our efforts to try and get the 
Chatham site, Santa Isabel, and all the rest of those hundreds of contaminated 
soil sites cleaned up, but there really are very few additional surface 
contamination sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Worden, 42, is an environmental attorney in Solana Beach, which also 
was his home from 1970 to 1981. He has lived in Del Mar for the past nine 
years. Worden served on the Coastal Commission in 1977 and was an alternate on 
the state coastal commission the same year. He represents the city of Encinitas 
in its opposition to the San Marcos trash-burning plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the adverse effect of growth, primarily manifested in traffic 
congestion. The second priority is the solid waste problem, recycling, the 
probing of trash, landfills, air quality is high on the list. I guess you'd 
call it an environmental problem, but preservation of the remaining natural 
open spaces is a very high priority. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic is very gloomy. I-5 runs something like 250,000 cars a day. It is 
predicted to go to 350,000 cars a day by 2010, which means it will be gridlock. 
And that's assuming the highway goes from the current 30,000 cars a day to 
100,000 cars a day. So, that's something pretty significant. On the traffic 
front, we're looking a L.A.-style gridlock in North County. 
</P>
<P>
In 1992, there will be commuter-rail service for the first time, so people will 
be able to commute from Oceanside, Carlsbad, Del Mar, etc., down to San Diego, 
and get out of their cars. And that will help, but even the commuter-rail 
system won't really solve the problem, only make it somewhat better. 
</P>
<P>
The trash problem: We have one landfill in North County, in San Marcos, that is 
somewhat full right now. The Board of Supervisors has been trying for 10 years 
to locate a new landfill, and they can't, they haven't done it. Where's our 
trash going to go? 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, recycling is starting to happen. Del Mar and Solana 
Beach, Carlsbad and a number of the other North County cities now have curbside 
recycling, where they give you these colored buckets and you separate your 
aluminum, your glass, your newspapers, plastics, and that can make a big 
difference. We're aggressively moving forward on composting, where you take 
lawn clippings, trees, all of that kind of stuff which takes up a lot of room 
in landfills. Through composting you can reuse it. 
</P>
<P>
And a related issue is sewage treatment. We're very controversial in the North 
County. We have a plant in Oceanside, one in Carlsbad, and one in Cardiff, all 
of which have ocean outfall, discharges, treated sewage going into the ocean. 
There's a lot of controversy about whether people are getting sick because of 
it.

LIFETIME SAID HELLO, MOLLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King

<TEXT>
<P>
Since last summer, fans of Lifetime Network's "The Days and Nights of Molly 
Dodd" have been wondering just who is the father of Molly's child. Is it her 
former boss, the sensitive bookstore owner, Moss Goodman? Or is he the handsome 
black police detective, Nate Hawthorne? 
</P>
<P>
The wait is finally over. This Friday evening at 10:30 p.m. Lifetime presents a 
new season of "Molly Dodd"-13 episodes this spring and 13 more episodes in the 
fall. At 10 p.m., Lifetime will air "Quiet on the Set: Behind the Scenes at 
Molly Dodd, a 30-minute documentary featuring clips and interviews with series 
star Blair Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The actress won't confess the identity of the baby's father. But, she said, "we 
have gone even further with Molly's fantasies and daydreams this year." 
</P>
<P>
"We have one show that's almost entirely a fantasy. It's completely insane. 
She's sitting in the waiting room for the doctor and dreams that her son is a 
blind, black jazz musician. She also has a fantasy where Moss and Hawthorne get 
into a rumble over Molly. It's really lunacy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown recalled that she didn't even know "Molly Dodd" had been canceled by NBC 
two years ago. "We had never heard from NBC," she said. "We just figured we 
weren't picked up." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking her days and nights as Molly Dodd were over, Brown flew to England to 
make a movie. One day, she received a call from Jay Tarses, the creator and 
co-executive producer of "Molly Dodd," informing her that Lifetime was 
interested in doing the show. "I didn't know cable from anything, but I told 
him I'd be happy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Lifetime has rolled out the red carpet for "Molly Dodd. "They actually have a 
dialogue with us," said Brown. "You feel that creatively they will defer to our 
gang. To be fair, NBC was not intrusive, it was only after the fact they were 
difficult. This is so different. You feel like you're on the same side." 
</P>
<P>
Brown has discovered both women and men watch the series. "People just come up 
to me on the street and say Hello,"' she said. "They feel that they know (Molly 
Dodd)." 
</P>
<P>
After shooting in Central Park one day, Brown recalled that she was approached 
by a woman about the same age as Molly who asked the actress what she was 
filming. "I told her and she looked at me and had no idea what I was talking 
about. But I met a young Hispanic man who knew the series, and later that day, 
I got a cab out of the park and the driver, a Chinese man who could barely 
speak English, said 'Molly Dodd, oh yeah!' So you see, you don't know who is 
watching you. You can't predict." 
</P>
<P>
After playing Molly for the past three years, Brown feels a kinship to her 
alter ego. "But I feel like she's a separate person from myself," said Brown. 
"We work together really well, she and I. But I do feel she's a separate 
entity. I can even go shopping for her. I did actually once go in a store and 
say, 'Molly would like this.' Then I thought to myself, This is crazy!' " Susan 
King
