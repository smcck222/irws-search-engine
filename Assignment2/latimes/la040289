ALICE KAHN: DEBUGGING THE BITE OF A MEGABYTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rainy Saturday stretched before me like a 20-megabyte disk waiting to be 
filled. It was 9 a.m., and I was bored already. I'd eaten my Shredded Wheat and 
banana. Now . . . what to do? 
</P>
<P>
The gray skies were relentless. It was the kind of weekend you wanted to 
delete. And then this idea popped onto my screen. 
</P>
<P>
I grabbed my husband and my Visa card and headed off to the Whole Earth Access 
Co. Today was the day I would make the great leap forward. Today was the day 
I'd leave my mid-'80s, mid-sized computer behind and move on up to a 
state-of-the-art Macintosh Plus with a hard-disk drive. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who saw my little old Macintosh with its cute little external drive 
said, "Someone like you needs more power." People couldn't believe I was still 
dragging that mouse across those wimpy little floppy disks. Someone like me 
needed hard disks, megabytes, certainly much more power. 
</P>
<P>
And I was sick of wasting my incredibly valuable time staring at the clock icon 
while waiting for the machine to function. I was an iconoclast. I wanted to be 
able to click and go. 
</P>
<P>
By high noon on that rainy Saturday, with a mere flick of the Visa card, I was 
up 20 megabytes and out two grand. 
</P>
<P>
We came home and unpacked all the boxes. The new computer; the external 
hard-disk drive; four manuals; three simple, self-explanatory disks; cables to 
connect my modem; my printer; special connections for the so-called "scuzzy 
port" -- hey, I was learning the lingo. 
</P>
<P>
I sat there like the Queen of Oz while my husband connected the whole thing. 
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain, I told myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Ready," he said. 
</P>
<P>
I went straight to work because time is money and money is power, and now I had 
more power so I ought to make more money. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing I noticed was that the new hard-disk drive made a horrible 
noise. It sounded like . . . a machine. I hate machines. 
</P>
<P>
I turned it off so I could think. When I turned it back on, I couldn't get the 
computer to recognize the existence of the hard-disk drive. 
</P>
<P>
I called my husband. "Honey, I can't find my megabytes." He couldn't find them 
either. 
</P>
<P>
I called my friend Brad. He was one of the apostles of the book, "The Macintosh 
Bible." But Brad wasn't home. He was at his office picking up his office 
computer so his kids could use his office computer at home and he could then 
use his home computer at home. 
</P>
<P>
I read the manuals. I tried all the simple, self-explanatory disks. I clicked 
and double-clicked all the files. The hands of the clock icon whirled 
relentlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I called the Whole Earth Access Co. The nice man said the drive was 
probably broken and that if I brought it in, they would see about getting me 
another one. 
</P>
<P>
"How could it be broken?" I asked. "We just bought it this morning." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they come like that," he said. "You know, most stores won't even 
take things back." 
</P>
<P>
The broken drive was whirling loudly. My husband said the noise wasn't the 
drive. It was the fan that cooled it. "It's important that you be able to hear 
the fan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was 4 o'clock. I had wasted five hours fiddling with the damn thing. I 
started thinking about how I'd need a radio to cover the noise. I would need 
days to figure out the new computer. I could waste a lot of time on this. 
</P>
<P>
We packed up the new computer, the bum drive, the four manuals, the cables and 
the three simple, self-explanatory disks. At 6 o'clock, I signed the paper 
de-Visa-ing the two grand. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 o'clock, I was sitting in sweet silent thought, watching the clock icon on 
my non-state-of-the-art, non-power computer. My friend Brad returned my call. 
</P>
<P>
"I solved the problem," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"How did you do that?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I erased the day."

GEORGIA O'KEEFFE; 
</P>
<P>
A LOOK AT THE REASONS FOR HER VAST POPULARITY SHEDS LIGHT ON THE TRENDS WITHIN 
THE ART COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were talking about Georgia O'Keeffe at the office before her exhibition 
opened at the County Museum of Art, where it will remain until June 18. One 
editor wondered why it is that O'Keeffe is one of those relatively rare fine 
artists who is popular with the public. This group -- a seemingly heterogeneous 
lot -- includes Michelangelo and Leonardo, Renoir, Van Gogh, Edward Hopper, 
Dali, Warhol and David Hockney. Why them? How did they attain the popular 
eminence of Norman Rockwell? 
</P>
<P>
The short answer, of course, is that each has qualities accessible to the 
unlettered eye. Either they made work that is obviously compelling or were 
great personalities, or both. In other words each has characteristics that make 
it possible to turn them into archetypes of Creative Nobility, Creative 
Suffering, Creative Eccentricity or Creative Charm. 
</P>
<P>
Such highly simplified caricatures of artists -- or anybody else -- are bound 
to be wrong simply because people are more complicated than that and artists 
are more complicated than most people. That means that most highly popular fine 
artists have been turned into cliches by their adoring fans. Michelangelo is 
revered for his great David and everybody feels as if he owns a piece of the 
Sistine ceiling -- witness the current fuss over its restoration -- but nobody 
pays much attention to his tragic, near-abstract "Prisoner" series because it 
is truly complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Degas is beloved for the charm of his ballet dancers, but the fact is, he was a 
crusty old misogynist who saw the dancers simply as a neutral formal motif and 
a symbol for his cranky notion that women are not much more than crafty little 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keeffe is a feminist hero despite the fact she specifically rejected having 
her art identified with any ideology. She started out as a no-nonsense 
schoolteacher who as a fledging artist had the guts to tell off the legendary 
dealer and photographer Alfred Steiglitz for mishandling her work. Then she 
upped and married that selfsame influential broker of avant-garde. He had one 
of the saltiest mouths in cheeky Manhattan. She was a match for him. He forged 
her youthful image in photographs so noble and sexy she would have been a 
personality if she'd never touched a brush. But she had a long time to do that 
too. She was nearly 100 years old in 1987 when she died in Santa Fe. A late 
photograph looks exactly like a portrait by Andrew Wyeth. (Now there is a 
marriage made in Popular Art Hero Heaven. They could go on the road with Rep. 
Claude Pepper as Gray Panther celebrities.) 
</P>
<P>
The curators who originated the present 100-work touring show for the National 
Gallery set out with the avowed intention of taking the spotlight off 
O'Keeffe's iconic personality and putting it back on her painting where they 
think it belongs. Instead nobody talks about anything but how popular the show 
is. Better reserve your tickets now. The catalogue is full of O'Keeffe's 
letters and the entrance to the galleries is festooned with photomurals of her 
ever-handsome visage. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the fate of good intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Something is afoot here that is even more interesting than the interesting 
question: Why Is Georgia O'Keeffe So Popular with the Populace? The real 
question is: Why Is That Question So Interesting? 
</P>
<P>
It represents a trend that is so persistent, pervasive and important as to make 
the very notion of a trend appear topical and slightly silly. It represents a 
mega-trend in the way art is appreciated and will therefore ultimately 
determine which art is appreciated. It is an epochal roll-over whose ultimate 
drift is to Make Art Like Everything Else. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the '60s there was a new trend every five minutes -- Pop Art, Op Art, 
Kinetics, Minimalism, Conceptual Art, Photorealism. Then artists began 
complaining that these trends were the bogus concoctions of curators and 
dealers, that in fact all kinds of art was made simultaneously all the time and 
that the new styles were just a form of commercial packaging. 
</P>
<P>
The whole notion of trends was discredited. Naturally, this resulted in a new 
trend. The '70s were dominated by a tendency for art to call attention to 
itself under the banner of various social issues -- Women's Art, Gay Art, 
Chicano Art, Black Art. None of this was deterred by the fact that scarcely 
anybody could find any coherent style or formal direction in any of these 
movements. According to existing standards of winnowing and sorting art, these 
movements simply did not exist, and yet there they were, fueled by political 
energies. 
</P>
<P>
So far these varying eddies continued to come from within the art world. A 
smart dealer of the epoch observed that the fine arts were the only art world 
where the public did not have a vote. The activities of the sphere were 
determined by a loop that included artists, dealers, critics, collectors and 
museums. The general public played no role in the determination of what was to 
be esteemed. 
</P>
<P>
This cabal is by no means broken. A former director of one of New York's major 
modern museums recently admitted that its exhibitions are organized for art 
insiders. John Q. Viewer just has to get along as best he can. Let him eat 
cake, preferably Twinkies. 
</P>
<P>
Unbroken but not unbowed. The first fissure in the fault line came one hot 
August day in 1986 when both Time and Newsweek magazines took the unusual step 
of running cover stories about the purchase of a block of paintings by Andrew 
Wyeth. They immediately became famous as "The Helga Paintings," went on a 
museum tour and played to a large popular audience. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, it was a benchmark event that signaled the entrance of Mr. 
Regular Citizen -- reflected in the popular media -- into the art game. Since 
then the tendency for artistic interest to be molded outside the art world has 
only grown. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, large social forces call the tune. The Soviet Union launches 
glasnost and there is a sudden spate of interest in contemporary Russian art. 
Little of it has been seen here and that has been egregiously bad, but never 
mind. Museums scramble to organize exhibitions. Japan looms large as a social 
force and suddenly everybody wants to know what their contemporary artists -- 
if any -- are up to. A recent issue of Time carried a story about art being 
made in Africa, not because the art has any aesthetic merit but because it 
grows out of a religious revival afoot on the great continent. 
</P>
<P>
Student art -- usually considered too green for the rigors of critical scrutiny 
-- can come to public attention these days if it manages to ruffle the feathers 
of the social fabric. Witness recent flaps in Chicago where one student got the 
nation's attention by painting the city's late mayor in drag and another laid 
Old Glory on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In these ways art is being made to appear understandable to anybody with eyes 
-- or without them for that matter. You can feel you are getting it by knowing 
the surrounding story -- or The Price. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, The Price. What could be more comforting in a materialistic society than 
posted auction prices that let the confused onlooker know exactly what a work 
of art is worth? (I used to teach a class called "The Value of the Arts." A 
number of people would always walk out on opening night when they discovered 
that the "value" in question was intrinsic.) 
</P>
<P>
All right. You say you are convinced all this popularization of the fine arts 
is happening. The next question is, So What? Is this justice at last for the 
little guy or a disaster for art? 
</P>
<P>
The critic Hilton Kramer thinks it's a disaster, if I read him right. In a 
recent issue of his magazine, the New Criterion, he fumed on about how art 
history and connoisseurship are being annexed by the social sciences, thus 
destroying a concern for quality crucial to a proper appreciation of the true 
meaning of art. It's true that even in academic circles these days art is being 
examined for its sociological and political content. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there is anything intrinsically wrong with that. What makes art 
interesting is that it can be legitimately read in so many ways. The better it 
is, the more readings it yields. But some readings are more obvious than others 
-- things like story-telling, resemblance to the model and historical 
circumstances can be readily determined with a good look and a little reading. 
But art is a language unto itself that has little or nothing to do with words. 
</P>
<P>
Picasso once said to Andre Malraux, "When people want to understand the Chinese 
they say, 'Well I'd better learn to speak Chinese.' But when they want to 
understand art they don't say 'Well, I'd better learn to speak Art.' " 
</P>
<P>
When I was a kid I loved the records of Edith Piaf so much I decided to learn 
French. When I could actually understand what she was saying I was a little 
disappointed, but at least I knew what was really going on. 
</P>
<P>
Being happy with one's own ignorance is a comforting illusion but it is 
Philistinism. There is plenty of that loose in the popularization of the fine 
arts. We are probably headed for a two-tiered value system that is closer to 
that long established in the performing arts. The Mandarins of the sphere go to 
the movie, concert or play and pronounce it a stinker because they have spent a 
lifetime refining their perceptions and ignoring their emotions. The Public 
responds that the critics are snobs and boobs because it's pulling huge crowds 
and grossing millions. Besides, the entertainment makes them feel good. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides always have something to learn from one another. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Hey! What about Georgia O'Keeffe? 
</P>
<P>
She comes very close to being a perfect compromise. The show looks even crisper 
at LACMA than when I reviewed it at the National Gallery, but it plays up both 
the striking beauty of the work and its rigid limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Her work appears challenging when encountered in a state of innocence and stays 
that way as long as the viewer doesn't change much. When he does, then 10 miles 
down the road there is a tendency to tip one's hat respectfully and move on to 
richer ground. 
</P>
<P>
When push comes to shove, art people -- painters especially -- tend not to put 
her in the very first rank. In the language of the subculture some say that is 
because she failed to come to grips with Cubism. That epochal style that 
restructured painting at the turn of the century was the savior or bugbear of 
virtually every serious painter to come along subsequently -- you either had to 
deal with it like DeKooning or find a way around it, like Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keeffe painted as if Cubism never existed. Her vision was essentially that of 
a close-cropped photograph. "Black Abstraction" of 1927 is not an abstraction 
at all but a rendering of a woman's leg with a white orb painted at the bend of 
the the calf. The Princess and the Poil. 
</P>
<P>
She had a real knack for distinctive imagery. Nobody really needs to describe 
what an O'Keeffe looks like. Her animal skulls, baroque flowers, seashells and 
woozy Taos architecture have been so widely reproduced they now exist somewhere 
between artistic icons and cultural cliches. It is a little disturbing that 
looking at the originals yields very little more than looking at the post 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
The current LACMA exhibition does provide new information about O'Keeffe. An 
early work such as "Special No. 2" (1915) reveals an attraction to the decadent 
metaphysics of Art Nouveau. For all her reputation as the Ultimate Flinty Earth 
Goddess she was intensely stylized, refined and -- as a painter, prissy, 
antiseptic and cautious. Contrarily, she was given to lumpy painterly rages as 
in a stylized 1916 landscape vaguely reminiscent of early Kandinsky or Arthur 
Dove. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she resolved this contradiction in works such as "Nature Forms," which 
is as overly stylized as a fit of planned hysterics or an animated backdrop for 
"Fantasia." 
</P>
<P>
She really was awfully mannered. And -- once again contradicting her myth as an 
obdurate independent -- profoundly seductive. 
</P>
<P>
Her world really looks as if it was made of exquisite fluttering silk ribbon. 
Sometimes it is as sensual as rich perfume, as in the modest "Red Poppy." She 
did not remain modest. By mid-gallery she's moved up in scale. Sometimes she is 
delicately grand, as in "An Orchid." In others, she is merely cranky and 
bombastic. 
</P>
<P>
But even when she is in a thundering fury she is always surprisingly accessible 
and controlled. She will always yield to readings as an abstractionist, a 
realist or a symbolist. But that's it. There is something public and closed off 
about this performance -- a grand dame of art doing her polished turn, 
revealing nothing of herself. She does what she knows she can do: the safe 
areas of color, carefully blended, rarely overlapped . . . risk free. 
</P>
<P>
There is marvelous chutzpah in this essentially conservative art. There is a 
bit of Surrealism too. We've seen it before. We've also seen the emblematic 
skull on a red, white and blue background. It reads as an icon of the American 
West, an impersonal symbol of sterility and renewal. Here for the first time it 
also looks like a kind of metaphysical Pop Art. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of art-babble is that? The people love her. The show will probably 
break a box-office record.

I'd like to thank KTTV for its nearly complete presentation of "The Pirates of 
Penzance." It certainly was enjoyable, and I hardly missed that 15-20 minute 
block of story (including three songs) that the station chopped out of the film 
in one piece to make room for commercials! Gee, I sure hope KTTV can maintain 
its high standards in coming presentations of "The Two Musketeers," "The Three 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and, of course, that old favorite, "Ali Baba and 
the 31 (and 1/2) Thieves." Way to go, guys!

Fans of that marvelous English soap opera, "Eastenders," will be saddened to 
hear that only a few more episodes are scheduled for broadcast on KOCE in 
Orange County. A spokesperson at the station told me that the last show will 
air on April 12 and there are no plans to purchase additional shows. If viewers 
enjoy the series as much as I do, they should let the station know.

We instructors in the aerobics profession have been trying very hard to entice 
men into the aerobics room. It is a great workout for anyone, any age, any sex. 
It is not a woman's domain. Men are already hesitant to try for fear of being 
confronted by women like Littwin. I hope none of my class members read her 
article, or I'll have to start back at square one! One more man in aerobics 
equals one less couch potato!

Littwin gives women a bad name. She praises women for being self-conscious, 
self-effacing and for taking up as little space as possible. These qualities 
are not feminine; they are neurotic. 
</P>
<P>
She says she wants equality. She wants revenge. She went into that room 
spoiling for a fight, carrying a lifetime of anger. Then she did the equivalent 
of driving into a parked car, and blamed it on the car. 
</P>
<P>
Littwin claims she speaks for all women when she says women have spent most of 
their lives trying to be one of the boys, and that she wants men to behave like 
girls. A real man doesn't behave like a girl. Neither does a real woman.

What Susan Littwin says about men and women and how they occupy space is true 
("Walk Like a Man," Feb. 5). If men and women are going to continue to enter 
into and co-exist peacefully in each other's domains, then they must be 
respectful of the effect they create on one another.

Unfortunately for us all, women still do struggle to fit into a man's world. 
But Littwin's use of an aerobics class to condemn this struggle further 
exemplifies a self-defeating attitude. Is it that women do aerobics and men 
make decisions in the board room? By her attacking her male counterpart in an 
aerobics class (on her turf, so to speak) at best defies the basic concept of a 
symmetry between men and women and at worst exemplifies a further separation of 
the sexes, and by a woman, yet.

. . . The animated "The Rescuers Down Under" -- about the Aussie adventures of 
those valiant mice, Miss Bianca, Bernard and their "mouse rescue squad" -- is 
in production at Disney. Due out next year, it's the sequel to the "Rescuers" 
(1977). This time, the mice will rescue a little Aboriginal boy from the 
clutches of a mean poacher, assisted by a kangaroo mouse named Jake -- who, we 
are told, is in the Mick Dundee mold.

Fans of "The Wizard of Oz" will be able to see 15 minutes of previously 
unreleased footage from the classic film when MGM re-releases the video in 
August. According to Herb Fischer, MGM-UA Home Video veep, the special 50th 
anniversary commemorative video package will have a new re-recorded sound 
track, a 24-page booklet on the making of the movie and a special feature with 
the rare footage at the end. 
</P>
<P>
You'll see Ray Bolger (the Scarecrow) singing "If I Only Had A Brain"; the 
original Tin Man, Buddy Ebsen -- who became allergic to his makeup and was 
replaced by Jack Haley two weeks into shooting -- singing "If I Only Had A 
Heart" over a montage of stills of him in costume; and Ebsen jitterbugging with 
Bolger, Judy Garland, Bert Lahr and in a dance sequence. 
</P>
<P>
"The jitterbug footage was destroyed in a studio fire years ago, but the 
vocal's intact," Fischer told us. "So we included home movies done by 'Oz' 
composer Harold Arlen on the set of the film (with) the vocal." 
</P>
<P>
More goodies: The original "Oz" coming attractions trailer, the 1939 Oscar 
ceremony (Garland got a special Oscar) and footage of Houston Post newspaper 
contest winners visiting the stars on the set. 
</P>
<P>
Since its 1980 release on video, "The Wizard of Oz" has sold more than 1 
million units at $40 retail. No price has been set for the new "Oz" package, 
Fischer said. Craig Modderno

Rick Nelson -- who went to rock 'n' roll heaven on New Year's Eve, 1985 -- will 
be the subject of "Teen Idol: The Rick Nelson Story" (tentative title), a bio 
to hit bookstores next year. "It will be sensitive -- not sensationalized," 
said author Philip Bashe, who stressed that the hardcover book -- from Simon 
&amp; Schuster -- "will not be an investigative attack." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bashe: "I'll be telling the story of a man who was unappreciated as a 
seminal rock 'n' roll artist. At the time he peaked, no one in rock 'n' roll 
was being taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Bashe, who has interviewed "about 132 people who knew and worked with Rick -- 
and I'm still not done," said his tome will clarify the events leading to 
Nelson's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seems to think that Rick Nelson died of drugs. What he died of was a 
plane crash, caused by a faulty gasoline heater." About the traces of drugs 
found in Nelson's bloodstream: "My book will get into that too. But I can't 
divulge details at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Bashe said he's working with "the blessing" of Greg McDonald, Nelson's manager 
for the last 10 years of his life, but mom Harriet Nelson so far isn't 
participating. "But I've got queries out to other family members," the author 
added. Pat H. Broeske

POP EYE: FILM DIRECTOR CAST IN ROLE AS A&amp;R EXEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You don't need a diploma to be an A&amp;R exec. Just keen ears. The lightning 
rods of the record industry, these high-profile talent scouts have the oddest 
resumes. They've been club deejays. Failed lawyers. Bored accountants. 
Magicians. Mailroom grads. Ex-band members. Even hotshot rock critics! 
</P>
<P>
Now you can add film directors to the list. Penelope Spheeris, best known for 
making such daring films as "Suburbia," "The Boys Next Door" and "Decline of 
Western Civilization: The Metal Years," has signed her first band -- Grave 
Danger -- to MCA Records as part of the label's attempt to attract young, 
hard-rock talent. (MCA has first refusal right for any bands Speeris brings to 
the label -- and in fact did not sign two groups earlier this year who were 
quickly snapped up by other labels.) 
</P>
<P>
Along with Vicki Hamilton at Geffen, Danny Crash at CBS and Dezi Benjamin at 
Virgin Records, Spheeris is part of a new breed of talent seekers who function 
as "out-patient" A&amp;R scouts, all on the look-out for the most outrageous 
new metal acts. "We're these street rats who aren't like the regular A&amp;R 
execs who go to bed by 10:30 p.m. and don't want to get scratches on their 
BMWs," she said. "Going to these crazy clubs -- it's like being on the ground 
floor of every new trend. You're seeing social change, for better or worse, up 
close every night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most fun part of my life -- it's better than a vacation in the 
Bahamas." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Spheeris is enamored by her band, Grave Danger, which she describes 
as a Chicago-style blues 'n' metal band. Its lead singer is an accomplished 
gymnast who performs a variety of somersaults on stage ("just think, the first 
heavy-metal gymnast"). But she's also dazzled by the tumultuous club 
environment, which has acted as a fervid spawning ground for innumerable new 
generations of bands. 
</P>
<P>
One favorite is English Acid, a Santa Monica Boulevard club, which offers live 
bands Wednesday nights. "It's a take-off on the late '60s with all these black 
lights, go-go dancers and psychedelic art," she said. "I heard a band there the 
other night doing Aretha Franklin's 'Chain of Fools' at full tilt and it was so 
strange. The audience was rocking out to it, but no one knew the words. They 
were too young to remember." 
</P>
<P>
Other popular clubs include Helter Skelter ("a real death-rock trip -- everyone 
wears black fishnet, huge crosses and looks depressed") and Bordello ("it's 
like a strip club -- they have go-go dancers who get pretty funky"). 
</P>
<P>
"The fashion is pretty much the 'sleaze look' right now -- lots of tattoos, 
long hair, cowboy boots and silver belts. You never know what's going to 
happen. The other night I found a $100 on the floor. And let me tell you -- I 
looked around the room and I couldn't believe any of these kids would have 
$100." 
</P>
<P>
In her mid-40s, Spheeris is old enough to feel vaguely maternal toward this 
scruffy crowd. "I feel so guilty sometimes because they treat me like a goddess 
of the universe," she said. "They're all so respectful and beholden -- and they 
always offer to get you a drink. It's a little much. Then again, I found a band 
that actually could quote dialogue from 'The Boys Next Door.' I mean -- I'm in 
this dark, crazy club and I finally found someone who liked my movie!" 
</P>
<P>
HE'S A WHAT?: By now, you've probably read most of the shocking revelations in 
Mark Ribowsky's new Phil Spector biography, "He's a Rebel." It's subtitled "The 
Truth About Rock's Legendary Madman," which pretty much captures the spirit of 
the book. Ribowsky's interviews with dozens of Spector cronies and 
acquaintances depict the celebrated producer as a paranoid, mean-spirited 
tyrant who bullied songwriters, manipulated his business partners, cheated on 
his wives and traveled with a pack of bodyguards who -- after Spector picked a 
fight -- would complete the job while Spector lounged in his limo. Was 
Spector's life really reduced to such a bizarre "carnival of irrationality" 
that the mercurial producer cut short a recording session with John Lennon by 
shooting his gun into the ceiling? ("Phil, if you're gonna kill me, kill me," 
Lennon reportedly said. "But don't (destroy) my ears.") 
</P>
<P>
The book, which was lauded by Vanity Fair, dissected by People and excerpted in 
Los Angeles magazine, has received largely favorable reviews. Asked to give his 
side of the story, the notoriously reclusive Spector has refused. But his 
attorney, Allen Klein, a longtime industry heavyweight who is mentioned several 
times in the book, gave his first public assessment of the book this week. 
After dismissing the portions devoted to him as "completely untrue," Klein 
added: "When you're dealing with this much schmutz and slime, it's impossible 
to shovel against the tide. There's such a plethora of inaccuracies that we're 
not going to just go talk to Barbara Walters -- we're putting together a very 
detailed response." 
</P>
<P>
Ribowsky's publisher, E.P. Dutton, has said it stands by the book. Still, Klein 
insists he's preparing a lawsuit, though he refused to provide details. "We're 
definitely going to sue. We just want to get all our ducks in a row first." He 
provided Pop Eye with a statement from songwriter Gerry Goffin, refuting quotes 
attributed to him in the book, which imply that Spector forced his name on 
songs he didn't actually write. Klein said Los Angeles is running a 
"semi-retraction" in its next issue, with a full-page ad (purchased by Klein) 
due in the June issue. (Actually the magazine is running a Klein letter with an 
editor's note clarifying portions of its excerpt.) 
</P>
<P>
Klein also heatedly responded to sarcastic media accounts of Spector's erratic 
behavior -- and rambling acceptance speech -- at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of 
Fame's recent induction ceremony. "The descriptions were just nonsense. He was 
very hurt. He was there to be honored, not to be criticized on his personal 
habits. Maybe Phil had a couple of drinks, but he spoke with intelligence and 
clarity. If you took a sobriety test at that place -- I mean, who in that 
audience wasn't drunk or stoned? He was probably the most sober guy there!" 
</P>
<P>
RAPPING UP: The year's sleekest rap hits come from Def Jam Records, which has 
just released "Classics Vol. I." The compilation features LL Cool J's original 
"Rock the Bells" (recorded when he was 17!), a pair of Beastie Boys tracks, 
Slick Rick's "The Ruler's Back" and Public Enemy's ferocious "Rebel Without a 
Pause" (especially notable for contributing the phrase "cold medina" to the rap 
lexicon). But the highlight is a hilarious wee-hours rap called "Cold Chillin' 
in the Spot," which features Def Jam founder Russell Simmons on the mike. 
Clearly improvising, Simmons swaps management strategy with partner Rick Rubin 
("I'm gonna rap myself and keep all the money") and touts a new dance step 
("OK, lift up your legs -- both legs -- with both hands and wiggle them in the 
air. Can you do it -- you're lying!")

COMING SOON : SNEAK PREVIEWS OF FORTHCOMING BOOKS; 
</P>
<P>
IN A PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BRYAN , From Baseball Lives: Men and Women of the Game Talk About Their 
Jobs, Their Lives and the National Pastime, by Mike Bryan, to be published this 
month by Pantheon Books. The speaker, Manny Mota, is the batting instructor and 
first-base coach for the Dodgers. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
'You gotta be aggressive, but by the same token you gotta be selective. You 
gotta put everything into that one at-bat.' 
</P>
<P>
ON SOME occasions I might swing the bat hard and miss the ball on purpose, just 
to get loose. A lot of times, or most of the time, I used to get behind in the 
count, like one strike, two strikes, and that helped me to be a better hitter. 
I knew I had to bear down and make good contact. If I'm gonna strike out, I'm 
gonna strike out swinging. The worse thing that can happen to a pinch-hitter is 
to get called out on strikes. When they put you in there, they want you to 
swing the bat. 
</P>
<P>
When (late Dodger manager) Walter Alston told me I was going to be the 
pinch-hitter for the Dodgers, I prepared myself mentally and physically to 
approach the game from a different angle: running more, taking a lot of extra 
hitting to keep my timing sharp, learning every pitcher in the league. I tried 
to have a book in my mind about every starter and reliever, about the guy who I 
was supposed to face in the late part of the game. I knew I had to discipline 
myself because I was only to hit once. I had to be ready. After the fifth 
inning, I start getting myself loose, going into the tunnel to do some running, 
or into the batting cage to take a few swings. I never let the manager surprise 
me. 
</P>
<P>
I loved to hit in a clutch situation because I learned how to control myself 
and not put on any kind of pressure. I loved to hit with men on base. Just try 
to relax, don't let anybody bother me and just concentrate on the guy on the 
mound and let him release the white ball. You check to see how they play you. 
Alston used me in situations where he really needed a base hit. In a wide open 
game, he tried to use somebody else. He knew I could not provide him with a 
long ball, but he could depend on me to try to bring the guy in from scoring 
position, second and third base. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot make mistakes. You gotta be aggressive, but by the same token you 
gotta be selective. You gotta put everything into that one at-bat. Total 
concentration and positive thinking. 
</P>
<P>
I have some big pinch-hits and I also have some other ones, which I don't want 
to talk about. One time in '77 or '78, I had a pinch-hit double against 
Philadelphia during the National League playoff, and we came from behind and 
won that game. Eventually we went to the World Series. That was one of the 
biggest. Also, when I tied Smokey Burgess (formerly of the Cincinnati Reds) 
with 144, and then when I broke the pinch-hitting record with 145. (Burgess' 
record was actually 145; Mota's is 150.) The double, I think it was kind of a 
breaking ball. I think Gene Garver was the pitcher. No. 144 was a fastball 
against Joe Sambito (of the Houston Astros); 145 was a breaking ball off (the 
late San Francisco Giant) Lynn McGlothen. I can see it in my mind. Those are 
the three biggest pinch-hits for me, I'd say. 
</P>
<P>
One time in 1977, we played an exhibition game against the New York Mets in my 
hometown in the Dominican Republic. I pinch-hit with the bases loaded and I hit 
a grand slam off Tom Seaver. That game was televised back to L.A. That was one 
of the greatest feelings I ever had as a pinch-hitter because it happened in 
front of my home people. The fans went wild and I was so happy, so pleased to 
come through in front of the fans from Los Angeles and from all Latin America 
and the Dominican Republic. The pinch-hit record doesn't belong to me, it 
belongs to all of them and all of the people who are rooting for me and all of 
the people who made it possible. 
</P>
<P>
I don't miss pinch-hitting because I enjoy coaching and being the hitting 
instructor. As the hitting instructor, the main thing is to tell the guy to 
make good contact, even the power hitter. Don't overswing. Go with the pitch 
and try to hit it hard. If you make good contact, you got a chance. What they 
do at batting practice, they've got to take into the game to apply. They've got 
to have concentration, desire, and they have to discipline themselves as a 
hitter. They have to learn the strike zone. A lot of hitters think about 
hitting every pitch to one side of the field, but you can use both sides. A lot 
of power hitters realize they don't have to pull everything to hit it out of 
the park because they are capable of hitting the ball out at every angle. 
</P>
<P>
I'm behind the cage during batting practice. If they try to overcut, I just 
remind them. I even call from the first-base coaching box if I see them do 
anything wrong, like pulling down or coming up, or pulling away. Usually I 
leave them alone and let them concentrate on the game, but if I see anything I 
think can help at that moment, I will do it. Sometimes the skip wants me to 
stay with the team at the bench and let somebody else coach first base, so I 
can communicate with the hitters before they go to the plate and after they 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
I'm here to build confidence and not destroy confidence, so there's no reason 
for me to get mad. If you fail seven out of 10 times, you are still a good 
hitter. You've got to make him believe. You've got to know the best time to 
approach a hitter. By the same token, you have to let him know that slumps are 
part of the game. I suggest to the guy in a slump that he try to hit the ball 
the other way. Doing that, you wait longer and while you wait longer you see 
the ball better. Sometimes you bunt. There's a lot of ways to get out of a 
slump. The worst thing to do is just try to overdo it, try too hard, try to get 
four hits in one at-bat. You gotta go little by little, and you cannot run 
before you can walk. 
</P>
<P>
As the first-base coach, I have to know the situation, tell the runner about 
the pitcher's move to first, about how the outfield is playing, and how well 
the outfielders throw. I have to memorize all the signs and be sure that the 
runner got the sign. If I have any doubts, somehow I communicate with the 
runner. Still, an awful lot of times we miss them with the kids, and sometimes 
even with guys who've played in the major leagues for a long time. I don't 
think established major-league baseball players should miss a sign. 
</P>
<P>
This is my life; this is my bread and butter; this is my family support. I 
enjoy every minute -- and every second. I love managing.

 It looked as if Engine Co. No. 28 would never open. For years I'd heard that 
the landmark 1912-era firehouse in downtown Los Angeles was going to be 
remodeled into a restaurant. Superchef Joachim Splichal was even rumored to be 
involved -- he was going to make affordable food. Then he was out, and nothing 
seemed to be happening. The construction site began to seem like another 
appendage of the downtown mess. The restaurant, most figured, would open along 
with Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
And then, late in January, the massive old firehouse doors finally swung open. 
Was the restaurant worth the wait? 
</P>
<P>
It certainly looked as if it had been. The place was handsome -- a real 
big-city restaurant with walls that soared 16 feet high to meet a pressed-metal 
ceiling. Businessmen stepped smartly across carpeted floors to sip martinis at 
the bar while they surveyed a domain of mahogany and padded booths. 
</P>
<P>
The firehouse theme was so impressively underplayed that if you didn't look 
carefully you might miss the holes in the ceiling through which the firemen 
once descended. (The brass poles are gone.) Even a pair of ceramic Dalmatians 
standing guard at the front window managed not to be too cute. In fact, the 
clubby room had such a settled look that were it not for the absence of that 
venerable old-grill aroma of mingled smoke, roasting meats and after-shave, it 
would be easy to believe that the restaurant had been around for years. 
</P>
<P>
At least until you sat down to eat. For no restaurant serving the food I ate at 
my first dinner at Engine Co. No. 28 could possibly have survived that long. 
</P>
<P>
The menu itself was not the problem: It fell right into the trendy New 
Traditionalism of modern restaurants, offering the straightforward American 
fare that everybody seems to want to eat these days. I began with a prawn 
cocktail -- a hard dish to mess up. But the prawns were mealy and tasteless, as 
if they'd sacrificed their flavor to the melting ice water they must have been 
stored in. Chili -- hardly a great gourmet feat -- was a cute little dish, 
served with a separate bowl of beans and little triangles of fried bread. It 
was a meaty, chunky stew with only one drawback: It may have been the worst 
chili I have ever tasted. 
</P>
<P>
A spinach salad was even worse. It was as soggy as a swamp and tasted so sad 
that after a first forkful nobody ventured a second. 
</P>
<P>
Our main courses were not much better. A hamburger, which came sandwiched 
between two thin slices of bread, was served with Bermuda onion, a handful of 
good French fries, red cabbage slaw, three kinds of mustard and a pickle. 
Everything seemed right. Everything, that is, except the flavor, which was 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
A veal chop didn't have much flavor either. We ended up devouring the excellent 
bread, drinking a few bottles of delicious Cold Springs beer and waiting for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
And then even the hot fudge sundae proved disappointing. It came with ice 
cream, a cherry and an upscale sprinkling of pistachios. All well and good. But 
it was lacking the one thing you really want in a hot fudge sundae -- lots of 
fudge. 
</P>
<P>
Can this be the great new downtown restaurant we've all been waiting for?, I 
wondered gloomily. Would the kitchen improve? 
</P>
<P>
It was a month before I went back for a second dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The room was just as handsome as it had been, but now there was an added 
element. It was buzzing with noise and people and anticipation; it had the look 
and feel of a thriving business. "Don't get your hopes up," I said to my 
guests. "There are so few nice restaurants downtown, that if the place is 
pretty enough people will overlook the food." 
</P>
<P>
"But there's nothing wrong with this," said one guest when his green salad 
arrived. It was an understatement: the salad was perfect -- a fine toss of 
crisp greens, each leaf lightly touched with a lively dressing. "Hey, these are 
terrific," said another guest, eating his Firehouse oysters with such dispatch 
that I barely managed a bite before they disappeared. The mollusks arrived 
sitting on a bed of rock salt, and beneath each oyster was a bed of minced 
sausage. On top of each was a spoonful of salsa and a light layer of melted 
cheese. I know the dish sounds improbably baroque, but it was so good we 
considered ordering a second plate. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably won't like this," said another eater, "but I think it's 
delicious." He was eating a beautiful scallop ceviche -- thin smooth slices of 
marinated scallops surrounded by a circle of diced avocado and papaya. I liked 
it a lot. 
</P>
<P>
But I did not like my own dish. As I stuck my fork into a dry chopped vegetable 
salad I said, "This is one of those depressing dishes that tastes like it's 
good for you." The mixture of wild rice, scallions, carrots, celery, fennel, 
carrots and red peppers looked lovely but tasted like it came straight out of a 
health food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
My friends were not sympathetic. "Complain all you want," said one, eating a 
grilled tuna salad that she described as "what I'd like to eat every day for 
lunch." It was an interesting concept -- strips of slightly charred tuna sat on 
a bed of mixed greens in a lemony dressing. Scattered across the salad were 
slices of deep-fried ginger, which gave the salad a vaguely Oriental air. She 
was echoed by the halibut eater, who was now half-way through a thick moist 
slice of fish. "This is as good a piece of fish as I can remember," he said. 
Then he eyed my plate with what I considered suspicious interest and added, 
"you seem to like your dish, too." 
</P>
<P>
Short ribs aren't ordinarily a big favorite of mine, but this was an elegant 
version of the dish. A long thin strip of meaty bones was drenched in a rich 
brown gravy and accompanied by a puddle of mashed potatoes and braised baby 
carrots and onions. It was American food at its best. 
</P>
<P>
And that, for the most part, is what the kitchen at Engine Co. No. 28 is now 
producing. Order lamb chops and you get a couple of hefty, flavorful chops 
served with a head of roasted garlic. Order a large salad and that's exactly 
what arrives in a big brown wooden bowl: a salad you can sink your teeth into. 
The sandwiches are hearty fare, and I have to admit that the hamburger, tried 
again, was really quite respectable, more like one you'd make at home than the 
sort of thing you are normally served in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
There are still some dishes that the kitchen hasn't quite mastered. The chicken 
pot pie, served as a special one week, was sadly lacking in chicken. Somebody 
needs to rethink that dry chopped vegetable salad. And as far as I'm concerned, 
the chili is still among the worst I've tasted. 
</P>
<P>
But why dwell on that when there's dessert to be eaten? True-blue American 
sweets that seem to be straight out of a church social. Strawberry shortcake is 
a big plateful of berries topped with a shortbread biscuit and a mountain of 
whipped cream. Lemon meringue pie sits proud and tall. Chocolate cake is the 
kind you'd take on a picnic; dark and moist -- it has no frosting and is simply 
dusted with powdered sugar. And if apple pan dowdy is really nothing more than 
a cheater's pie, who could possibly resist that name? 
</P>
<P>
Engine Co. No. 28 is finally open. And it looks like it will be around for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: Firehouse oysters, $6.50; mixed green salad, $4.50; 
grilled tuna salad, $9.50; broiled halibut, $13; braised short ribs, $13.50; 
strawberry shortcake, $3.95.

AMERICA FIRST AT ENGINE CO. NO. 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You won't find Dom Perignon on the wine list at Engine Co. No. 28. In fact, you 
won't find any French wine -- it's an all-American list. That would have been a 
great touch had it not been for pricing, which is just a tad too high -- about 
twice retail across the board. 
</P>
<P>
Still, all things considered, this is a list that only a true wine lover could 
have created. In fact, the list was assembled by Jerry Goldstein: former owner 
of Acacia Winery, all-around fun guy, and a Los Angeles wine aficionado with an 
eclectic palate. 
</P>
<P>
That last attribute serves him (and us) well in this wine list because of the 
wide variety of wine styles we can find. 
</P>
<P>
In Chardonnay, for instance, there's everything from the overblown 1986 Kalin 
Cuvee LD (excessively priced at $37.50) to the delightful, engagingly fruity 
1987 Mazzocco (at a best-buy $18). Or pick the omnipresent Sonoma-Cutrer 
Russian River at $20, or the sensational 1986 Cain Cellars Carneros at $28. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 20 Chardonnays offer such a range of styles that the only thing missing 
(in a best-of-all-possible-worlds addition to this list) would be some clue for 
the tyro about which style each wine is made in, a la Chez Melange in Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There's more excitement: five well-chosen Sauvignon Blancs (best buy: 1987 
Robert Pecota, $15); eight sparkling wines (best buy: Domaine Mumm Cuvee Napa, 
$26.50); 35 Cabernet or Cabernet-type wines (best buy: 1985 Estancia, $14); 
five top-of-the-line Pinot Noirs including 1987 Saintsbury Garnet at $16.50 . . 
. and then, the real pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
That is, when you dine on upscale diner food, you want quaffing wine as an 
option, and here Goldstein offers the likes of Chenin Blanc (2), Gewurztraminer 
(2), Riesling (2) and Charles Shaw's 1987 Gamay at $14.50, a grand chillable 
light red. All of these are lower-priced selections ($12.50 to $14.50), which 
offer the luncheon diner a chance to create a fine atmosphere and experience 
without fearing the accountant's scowl back at the office. 
</P>
<P>
Those who love Zinfandel with meat loaf will have their pick of three, but alas 
the price of my favorite wine, 1985 Kendall-Jackson DePatie-DuPratt, is $21.50. 
Ouch! 
</P>
<P>
For Bonny Doon fans, there's the requisite Le Cigare Volant and Old Telegram 
($25 each). And for those who get tired of the humdrum, you may try a hard, but 
interesting 1986 Merlot from Bridgehampton on Long Island in New York. Or even 
a sparkling wine from New Mexico, DomaineCheurlin. 
</P>
<P>
Three fine dessert wines by the bottle and a wide selection of Cognacs and 
brandies, plus a good beer selection (including Sierra Nevada on tap and 
Genessee Cream Ale) round out a well thought-out selection. 
</P>
<P>
One drawback at the fire station that is common to so many restaurants: Red 
wine served too warm. However, glassware is attractive, thin-stemmed goblets, 
and service is gimmicklessly efficient and ebullient -- no waiters sliding down 
brass poles with bottles tucked under their arms, no silly red hats. I always 
like a little restraint in theme restaurants.

THEATER NOTEBOOK: 9 GOOD INNINGS -- YEARS, THAT IS -- FOR 'BLEACHER BUMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it "The Miracle of 'Bleacher Bums.' " 
</P>
<P>
The nine-inning comedy about a crazy collection of Chicago Cubs fans in the 
stands at Wrigley Field (ongoing at the Century City Playhouse) has become the 
longest-running show in local history. This month, "Bleacher Bums" celebrates 
its ninth anniversary, a feat that Burbage Theatre Ensemble artistic director 
Ivan Spiegel admits amazes him as much as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people are repeaters," he said of the audience. "A lot are people 
who go to the Groundlings, the Comedy Store -- those kinds of places. It's also 
a good first-date show. A guy can show a girl that he's cultured -- and since 
it's about baseball, men aren't threatened. It's not like going to see Chekhov. 
We also have a lot of parties and, of course, everyone who's visiting from 
Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
The director maintains his own interest by keeping a bit of a distance. "I 
don't go that often anymore," he explained. "Every once in awhile, I'll go in, 
do some cleanup work, run a section of the play, make sure the actors are where 
they should be. But I've got assistants now who work with me. Also, the show is 
double-cast -- and we recast it every three months. So that helps keep it 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's my best work," he said. "But I am proud of it. And it's 
provided a way to do the work I want to do. I'm an artist; I'm not here to make 
money. I wanted to effect some change in society -- and our children's theater 
has done that. When the Burbage started in '69, we were a street theater doing 
political, avant-garde work. We thought 'Bleacher Bums' would be a nice light 
comedy we could do for three months over the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Glowing reviews changed that. The morning they appeared, "the phones were 
ringing off the hook," Spiegel recalled. "In two hours, we sold out the first 
month. Since then, it's just fed on itself. How long will it go on? Who knows? 
Probably till I get tired of it -- or people stop coming." 
</P>
<P>
NEW IN VAN NUYS: Jeremiah Morris has been chosen artistic director of Actors 
Alley in Van Nuys, a post he's finding "wonderful and hectic -- well, more 
wonderful than hectic. Part of me's always been a teacher," said the 
actor/director (who once ran the Seven Arts Center theater complex in New York 
and also taught at Boston University), "and part of me is a pain -- always 
complaining about what everyone else is doing. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can put my money where my mouth is," he said. "I've got some strong 
ideas about theater -- and about this theater. For example, every year, I'm 
going to do one play that hasn't been given its due. This season, I'm doing 
'Big Fish, Little Fish' by Hugh Wheeler -- which had a small run on Broadway in 
1958 with Jason Robards and Hume Cronyn, and was picked apart by the critics. I 
want to give these plays a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
NOTABLE OPENINGS: Julie Harris and Brock Peters star in Alfred Uhry's 1988 
Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy, "Driving Miss Daisy," about the friendship 
between an older woman and her chauffeur. It opens Friday at the Henry Fonda 
Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Widowers' House," George Bernard Shaw's rarely done comedy about housing 
shortages and rent-gouging landlords, opens April 14 at Actors Alley. 
</P>
<P>
"Fragging" -- a term referring to soldiers killed by their own side (as 800 
Americans were in Vietnam) -- was written by Louis Cimino, who experienced the 
war as an 18-year-old. A semi-finalist at the O'Neill Playwright's Competition, 
it opens April 11 at the New Playwright's Foundation in the Fairfax district. 
</P>
<P>
"Absurd Person Singular," Alan Ayckbourn's comedy of class relations and 
marital strife, gets a revival at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys, opening 
April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Deitch, who directed the recent "The Women of Brewster Place," will stage 
another women's tale, Anne Devlin's "Ourselves Alone," the story of three women 
in contemporary Ireland. It opens April 22 at the Tiffany Theatre in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Playwrights Express holds its annual marathon April 22 and 23 at the First 
Methodist Church in Hollywood, with a continuous program of new works -- plays, 
screenplays, monologues, one-acts, excerpts and works-in-progress. Information: 
(213) 850-6271.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: MT. HERMON'S RIBS TAKE THE HUNGRY AND MAKE 'EM BELIEVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somehow, Pico Boulevard is a little small-townish along this stretch. Middling 
traffic. Unpretentious little houses. Sea breezes. An egg store. Santa Monica 
College. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so there's a college. So we'll say this part of Pico Boulevard is like a 
small college town. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, of course, a small college town. Behold the old alma mater with its tall, 
graceful trees; its wide, peaceful lawns; the tides of youth surging across the 
lawns on paths that the landscapers disdained to foresee; baroque concertos and 
reggae without end going out over the airwaves from the college's own FM 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Tour's over. Let's get serious: Where do we eat? A vegetable hut? A falafel 
palace? A burgerteria? Mt. Hermon? 
</P>
<P>
No question; let's go to Mt. Hermon. Very conveniently for our tour, it happens 
to be right across the street from the Santa Monica College auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Hermon is not exactly a restaurant, though. It doesn't have -- well, there 
isn't much point spelling out all the things the usual restaurant has that Mt. 
Hermon lacks, starting with walls and a roof. It's actually just the parking 
lot of a Baptist church. However, you can get some very good Southern barbecue 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The barbecue operation is a fund-raiser for the church, which is why there's a 
list titled "Donations" instead of a price list. It's undoubtedly why the 
people serving you are so sociable because they're clearly volunteering 
parishioners rather than restaurant professionals. They're as genuinely 
sociable, in fact, as the waiters who tell you their first names in real 
restaurants are pretending to be. 
</P>
<P>
The cooking is done in as many as three giant oil cans-turned-barbecues, which 
billow impressive quantities of smoke whenever any of them is opened. You place 
your order in the vicinity of the donations list, then somebody goes over to 
the appropriate oil can barbecue, pulls out the requisite pork ribs, sliced 
beef, chicken or sausage and brings it back to where you are, which is also 
where the beans and the barbecue sauce are being kept hot. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you've ordered is put in a Styrofoam carton, and there are plastic 
bags to help out if there's more than one carton in your order. You figure out 
for yourself where to eat it all. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what you get with your order of a dinner: meat with sides of beans and 
potato salad, a slice of bread and a slice of pound cake. With a combination, 
you get the same, but with two kinds of meat. With a sandwich, you get less 
meat, no cake. 
</P>
<P>
The beef is tender and extremely smoky, though I've had a report of less tender 
meat at 3 in the afternoon one day, perhaps between shifts. The chicken is 
moist and tender, and you can specify dark or light meat. And it's very smoky, 
of course. The links are good ones, rich and slightly spicy, and very, very 
smoky. The ribs are meaty and tender with just a little chewiness. And plenty 
of smokiness. 
</P>
<P>
The barbecue sauce is rather mild (after all, we're practically in church 
here), sweet and sour and scarcely hot at all, but it's the real homemade item. 
It's served out of the pot it's cooked in. 
</P>
<P>
The sides are uniformly beans, meaning very plain boiled pinto beans with no 
flavored sauce (they can be perked up by mixing in some of the extra barbecue 
sauce available in little plastic cups). 
</P>
<P>
The potato salad is the most variable thing. Sometimes it's the usual style 
with a particularly eggy dressing and pickle relish, and sometimes it's more 
like mashed potatoes with green onions (particularly good). The only dessert is 
pound cake. If you want something to drink, you can buy a can of soda, making 
your own selection from an ice chest. 
</P>
<P>
There's usually one table around, sometimes apparently set up for people to 
dine at and sometimes just as a place for somebody to keep the accounts. It may 
seem that there is a spur-of-the-moment quality about all this, but Mt. Hermon 
is serious enough to have its own telephone number (the telephone is on a 
little stand toward the back of the parking lot, with the cords going into the 
church). 
</P>
<P>
Eating here is always a social occasion, once in a while spiced up by a genial 
argument about the correctness of someone's views on barbecue (having been 
brought up in Texas and always having had it such and such a way regularly 
seems to be a decisive argument). Pico Boulevard is just a small town, after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: chicken sandwich, $2.75; sausage dinner, $6; beef and rib 
combination, $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Hermon Baptist Church, 1827 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 450-1777. Open 
for lunch and dinner 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays. No 
alcoholic beverages. Street parking. No credit cards. Lunch for one, food only, 
$2.75 to $9.50.

Really! All this fuss over Madonna. I find her no more objectionable than any 
of the other airheaded, pretentious pop stars of today (Michael Jackson, George 
Michael, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the woman is like personally, but I do know that when I'm in 
a disco and a Madonna tune comes on, I want to dance. After all, isn't that the 
point?

"Lewd behavior?" "Self-absorption"? "Marginally voiced"? "Screwed up"? These 
are the words used against Madonna by judge-and-jury letters writers (March 
26). The word that comes to my mind is jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna is beautiful, talented and laughing all the way to the bank. When was 
the last time Pepsi offered you $5 million?

I'm a white male. Never have I packed R&amp;B into a "black only" category nor 
have I put pop, country, rock or other music into a "white" category. It scares 
me that such marketing "tunnel vision" exists in the music industry.

ARTS AND CRAFTS FURNITURE

<P>
IN THE 1890's and into the first decades of the 20th Century, most American 
furniture makers favored European models of the most elaborate kind. John Henry 
Belter's laminated imitations of French Second Empire were wildly popular. But 
from the vantage point of the 1980s, they're completely tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
Far more appealing to the modern idea of spare and simple design is American 
arts and crafts furniture (also known as Mission or Craftsman furniture). While 
elaborate Victorian and imitation European furniture continued to be 
manufactured in quantity during the last years of the 19th Century, arts and 
crafts furniture began to achieve acceptance by the time of World War I. Its 
simple design and craftsmanship, of course, was influenced by the European arts 
and crafts movement. 
</P>
<P>
In both Europe and the United States, this movement was a reaction against the 
Industrial Revolution and everything it represented. In England, painters such 
as William Morris and art critics such as John Ruskin encouraged handmade 
products as a replacement for mass-produced fabrics, wallpaper and ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
One talented American furniture designer who welcomed these theories was Gustav 
Stickley of Syracuse, N.Y. The furniture he made was linear and unpretentious, 
constructed by hand with local materials, usually oak: simple dining-room 
sideboards, unadorned chairs, functional desks, all quite different from the 
usual fussy Victorian furniture. Stickley's furniture imitated nothing, though 
it turned out that he was much imitated by the big Grand Rapids manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
By 1901, Stickley's designs had come to the attention of two California 
architects, the brothers Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene. In the 
years to come they provided both the architecture and the interior design for 
137 houses, of which 75 remain. Their work, though it had its own individual 
genius, was heavily influenced by Stickley and the arts and crafts movement. 
Their furniture was reserved for their architectural clients, but the 
principles were the same: elegant form, exquisite craftsmanship, handwork and, 
above all, simplicity of design. 
</P>
<P>
Today authentic Stickley furniture is expensive and is likely to be found 
mostly in the East and the Midwest, while Greene &amp; Greene furniture, made 
primarily for specific houses and individual clients, is rare and even more 
expensive. However, some pieces are available from time to time, and furniture 
of the same general type was made by Peter and John Hall (who built most of the 
Greene &amp; Greene furniture) and by Louis B. Easton and Harold Doolittle. 
Such furniture is wonderfully evocative of early California and is rich with 
the flavor of turn-of-the-century Pasadena and Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 A good introduction to the arts and crafts movement, particularly as it 
appeared in California, is to visit the Gamble House, designed inside and out 
by Greene &amp; Greene. It is now a museum, located at 4 Westmoreland Place, 
Pasadena. Some shops that specialize in arts and crafts furniture are Couturier 
Gallery and Buddy's, both in Los Angeles, and Jack Moore Arts and Crafts, 
James/Randell (reproductions), El Adobe (by appointment only), all in Pasadena.

PARENTS ALL OVER the country still drill rope-holes in 2x10s to fashion swings 
for their children. More substantial favorites for all ages are plenty. There 
are hardwood slat-backed bench swings for two, three or four, suspended from 
trees, porch beams and A-frames. There are four-seat, face-to-face wooden 
platform lawn swings on cross-braced stands. Gliders for two to five passengers 
are made of slatted wood and of enameled aluminum or decorative wrought iron 
with plump cushions and big, fringed canopies. Some canopies are bowed and 
hinged like the tops of covered wagons. 
</P>
<P>
Oval rattan chair swings, popular since the 1950s, now come with cane seats. 
Natural and colored string hammock chairs suspended from crossbars come with or 
without pillows. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern artisans hew rustic two-seat cedar log swings with fan backs, 
slatted contour seats and lodgepole A-frames. Local artisans handcraft them of 
bent willow. Rattan Rarities imports a dainty wicker swinging Victorian love 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden, aluminum and wrought-iron gliders are sold by Universal Patio 
Furniture in Studio City, Zander's in Thousand Oaks and Victory Furniture in 
Los Angeles. Rattan chair swings are sold by Mastercraft Rattan in Torrance, El 
Toro, Gardena and Redondo Beach. Look for hammock chairs at Pier One stores. 
Malibu Feed Bin in Malibu sells cedar log swings. Wood Bender in Costa Mesa 
offers willow swings. The Victorian swing is sold by Rattan Rarities in Sherman 
Oaks. Slatted pine and redwood swings, lawn swings and gliders are sold through 
the Sears catalogue.

THE AT&amp;T LOGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LASKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EVIDENTLY, THE magistrate fancied himself an art director. After the breakup of 
AT&amp;T in 1983, in which the portion of the conglomerate that kept the 
AT&amp;T name separated from the regional telephone companies, U.S. District 
Judge Harold Green ordered the new, smaller AT&amp;T to stop using the familiar 
bell-in-a-circle logo. In stepped designer Saul Bass, of Los Angeles-based Saul 
Bass/Herb Yeager Associates, with a new company logo. Bass had previously 
created symbols for corporate giants such as Warner Communications (the 
blobby-looking "W"), Quaker Oats and Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Bass had spruced up the old bell-in-circle trademark (nearly as 
ancient as Alexander Graham Bell's invention itself) with a cleaner, crisper 
bell symbol. Intended to counter a public perception of old Ma Bell as stodgy 
and stuffy, his redesign was a stunning success. Though the existing logo had 
boasted an enviable public recognition rating of 79%, Bass' redesign, two years 
later, rated an astonishing 93%. Bass put that figure in perspective in a 1985 
interview: "United Airlines, whose symbol we also designed, is very pleased 
with 46% public awareness." 
</P>
<P>
The pre-divestiture Bell logo was a tough act to follow, but Bass' lightning, 
it seems, has struck twice. The new AT&amp;T logo comprises a blue sphere with 
white striations of differing width and curvature, seemingly pulsating on the 
printed page. The logo resembles a globe with lines of latitude -- or are they 
telephone cables? No matter, it makes an apt image for a firm that transmits 
electronic information around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond such literal connotations, Bass' symbol shrewdly plays on our 
subconscious associations. For, as graphic designer Veronica Napoles writes in 
Corporate Identity Design, consumers associate round or oval symbols with 
organic, nurturing qualities. Bass' AT&amp;T logo didn't lose a Ma Bell, it 
gained an earth mother.

SPINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A PIECE OF WOOL yarn is actually many pieces of fiber that have been twisted 
and pulled, lengthened and strengthened into one cohesive unit. Spinning was 
traditionally a woman's job, so much so that the name of a spinning accessory, 
the distaff, now refers to women in general. 
</P>
<P>
Although the spinning wheel is associated with American pioneer life, it is a 
relatively recent invention. Before the spinning wheel, when ancient Egyptians 
and Greeks spun their exquisite diaphanous fabrics, women used drop spindles, 
deceptively simple tools requiring expert coordination: The drop spindle is a 
tapered rod with a notch at the top and a circular whorl or disc attached close 
to its lower tip. The raw fiber is attached to a starter yarn that is tied to 
the spindle notch and wound down round the whorl. Drawing out fibers between 
thumb and fingers of one hand, the spinner twists the spindle with the other 
hand, allowing it to drop toward the floor as it stretches and spins the fibers 
into one continuous strand. If the spinner isn't careful and quick, the spindle 
can reverse itself, unwinding the fiber and ruining the spinner's day. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to that, a spinning wheel is high-tech. A foot-operated pedal turns 
the wheel, which spins the spindle and winds the fiber; the spinner can use 
both hands to feed the fiber, allowing more control. The drawbacks: Wheels, 
unlike drop spindles, are not portable, and they can be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Piecemakers Country Store in Costa Mesa regularly offers beginning and 
advanced classes in spinning. The Folk Art Festival at the Natural History 
Museum of Los Angeles County, in Exposition Park, scheduled for June 4 this 
year, will feature several spinners demonstrating the craft and offering 
informal instruction. County fairs are excellent places to see spinning 
first-hand. The Orange County Fair in Orange, July 12-23, plans a demonstration 
of angora-rabbit-hair spinning, among others. The Los Angeles County Fair in 
Pomona, Sept. 14-Oct. 1, will feature a spinning competition and several 
demonstrations near the wool display in the Agricultural Pavilion.

NEWSMAKERS: AND A WORLD RECORD FOR JET LAG?

 -- One minute you're in Sri Lanka and the next you're in Africa. Around the 
world in 80 days? More like a leisurely three weeks in these days of supersonic 
travel, and that even allows for a safari in Africa and cruises in Tahiti, 
Mexico and New Zealand along the way. As the Concorde set out Saturday from 
London on its first supersonic circumnavigation of the globe, it wasn't the 
flying time that was to account for much of the 22 days of the trip. With a jet 
that can cover the 3,000 miles from Sri Lanka to Kenya in 2 hours, 40 minutes, 
it's more likely that the sightseeing stops will be eating up most of the 
travel time. Leading the group of 100 passengers who paid $39,000 each for the 
trip is American journalist William F. Buckley Jr., who, in another supersonic 
first, plans to broadcast his television show "Firing Line" from Cape Town, 
South Africa, and Sydney, Australia, during the journey. In addition to those 
stops and the cruises in Acapulco, Mexico; Christchurch, New Zealand, and 
Papeete, Tahiti, the jet will touch down in New York; Oakland; Honolulu; 
Colombo, Sri Lanka; Mombasa, Kenya, and Monrovia, Liberia, during the 
38,343-mile voyage.

 -- With the death of cartoonist Milton Caniff on April 3, 1988, a mighty 
pilot, Air Force Col. Steve Canyon, vanished from the skies. But the Air Force, 
loath to let one of its heroes go unrewarded, will formally retire the comic 
strip character with full military honors Monday in a ceremony at Ohio State 
University. After painstakingly going through all of the old Canyon strips, Air 
Force personnel compiled a biography and list of Canyon's exploits, which will 
be featured in an exhibit in the journalism school's library, recently 
dedicated to Caniff, a graduate of the school in Columbus, Ohio. "Through Steve 
Canyon, Milt Caniff did a lot to keep up the spirits of fliers and the Air 
Force," said 1st Lt. Lynn Ellen Bryant. Canyon's service record "includes 
decorations, citations, movement orders for each base, family data, all sorts 
of good stuff," Bryant said. But the Air Force decided that since his record 
was so varied, Canyon could only be assigned to the Office of Special 
Investigations.

 -- Enough talk about international relations. When President Bush and Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak take the helicopter from Washington to Baltimore on 
Monday the chatter will be about 7th-inning stretches and sacrifice plays. In 
an unusual windup to a day of diplomatic dialogue, Bush and Mubarak will attend 
the baseball season opener between the Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red 
Sox, with Bush throwing out the first ball. ANN CONNORS

FOREIGN CADETS ARE EXPOSED TO AMERICAN IDEALS AT WEST POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WEST POINT, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States Military Academy is legendary for producing such all-American 
war heroes as Ulysses S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower. But 
the "country" in West Point's motto "Duty, Honor, Country" does not necessarily 
mean the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For the last century, West Point has also been a training ground for future 
generals of foreign armies -- dictatorships as well as democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers such as Filipino Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the late Nicaraguan dictator 
Anastasio D. Somoza and pre-revolutionary Chinese Army Gen. Ying Hsing Wen 
marched out of West Point's storied Long Gray Line to play key historical 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30 Foreign Cadets 
</P>
<P>
This year's foreign plebes come from Bolivia, Guatemala, Lebanon, Liberia, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Malawi, Singapore, Jordan, Turkey and Zimbabwe. 
Currently, 30 foreign cadets are training at West Point from Bangladesh, Haiti, 
Senegal, Cameroon, Liberia and Botswana, among other places. 
</P>
<P>
Once approved by the secretary of defense, a nation's politics or relations 
with the United States are not considered in judging an applicant's merits, 
says Capt. Robin Carrington, admissions officer for foreign cadets. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not deal with philosophy," Carrington said. "We try to keep standards 
for foreign cadets exactly the same as U.S. citizens." 
</P>
<P>
There are cadets from countries ruled by hard-line dictators who do not 
tolerate dissent or hold elections, as well as from countries with democratic 
governments like that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of educating foreign cadets at West Point, according to a 
congressional report, is to build good will and expose future foreign military 
leaders to American ideals, especially in developing nations where the United 
States seeks to promote stability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Programs 
</P>
<P>
Annapolis and the Air Force Academy have similar programs. By law, each 
military academy is allowed 40 foreign cadets at a time. At the moment, the Air 
Force academy has 37 and the naval academy 32. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to provide an opportunity for students from selected countries to 
attend the Air Force Academy and learn more about the way we do business in 
this country and go back home with a first-rate military education and 
hopefully be better allies," said Lt. Col. John Swiney, associate director of 
admissions at the U.S. Air Force Academy. 
</P>
<P>
Fidel Ramos graduated from West Point with honors in 1950. Thirty-six years 
later, he played a pivotal role in the revolt that ended Ferdinand E. Marcos' 
20-year reign in the Philippines and put Corazon Aquino in power. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos developed friendships with West Point classmates who went on to powerful 
posts in the U.S. military, including Charles Gabriel, an Air Force chief of 
staff, and John Wickham, who became the U.S. Army's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos is now Philippine defense secretary and one of his country's most popular 
figures. A veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars, Ramos is using his education 
to fight a communist insurgency and quell coups in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits for Countries 
</P>
<P>
Natee Wongissares, a senior from Bangkok, Thailand, agrees that both countries 
have benefited from Thailand's cadets at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
"In the future these people (West Point graduates) have a tendency toward the 
United States," the Thai cadet said. "They can affect the relationship between 
the two countries for a better relationship, they will work together." 
</P>
<P>
Unstable political climates in some Third World countries, where change is more 
apt to take the form of a coup than a democratic vote, have created unusual 
situations for West Point graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Moises Cortizo, Class of 1980, is a loyal aide to Panamanian strongman 
Manuel A. Noriega, at odds with the United States since his indictment by an 
American grand jury on drug trafficking charges last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Ernesto Castro, Class of 1973, sought political asylum in the United 
States after testifying before Congress about his activities as a leader of a 
Salvadoran death squad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Somoza a Graduate 
</P>
<P>
Anastasio D. Somoza, son of the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, was given 
command of the Nicaraguan national guard when he graduated from West Point in 
1946. He went on to succeed his father as president before the Sandinista 
revolution ended that regime. 
</P>
<P>
West Point's first foreign cadets came from South America, but the program has 
expanded virtually worldwide. Countries with cadets at West Point are no longer 
necessarily U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet cadets may enter West Point classrooms next fall under a program 
approved by the Ronald Reagan Administration allowing West Point and Soviet 
military academies to exchange cadets for two-week visits. 
</P>
<P>
American cadets also have the opportunity to spend two weeks at a foreign 
military academy in one of more than 30 countries including Venezuela, Jordan, 
Belgium, Morocco, the Dominican Republic and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Of more than 70 nations invited, 25 to 30 send applications. Many of America's 
strongest allies do not send cadets to West Point. NATO member countries are 
invited but don't participate, although a Canadian midshipman is attending the 
naval academy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designated Spaces 
</P>
<P>
Foreign cadets don't compete against American candidates, says academy 
spokeswoman Andrea Hamburger. "These spaces are specifically designated for 
non-American cadets. They have to meet the same basic criteria as a cadet here 
would." 
</P>
<P>
At West Point all cadets eat the same food, adhere to the same dress code, take 
the same courses and meet the same requirements for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to chemistry, engineering and science courses, they can study the 
history of technology and warfare, the American experience in Korea and 
Vietnam, space mechanics, terrain analysis, military computer systems, military 
ethics and nuclear reactor design. 
</P>
<P>
"They are usually very, very serious students and good students. Depending on 
where they are from, some struggle with English," Carrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Some have more than a language barrier to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Carrington recalls one cadet from an African tribe who had never flown on an 
airplane until he came to West Point. He had only heard about water coming out 
of the walls, but had never seen or taken a shower and had to be shown how to 
drink out of a soda can. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Culture Shock 
</P>
<P>
"There is some culture shock, especially in the beginning," Carrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, foreign cadets are not so different from American boys who grow up 
dreaming of going to West Point. 
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok, Natee Wongissares dreamed of becoming a West Point cadet. "It was 
my life goal since I was 12 to get to West Point," he says. "Since I saw a 
movie about Eisenhower when he was a general, I wanted to be just like him."

Two Thai naval vessels left for Bangkok on Friday, carrying home 1,700 illegal 
workers, a Thai diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
That brought to 9,700 the number of workers who have been repatriated by 
Thailand in the past three weeks, said the diplomat, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the workers are farmers who were brought here by syndicates.

WAL-MART'S GREETERS MAKE SHOPPERS HAPPY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the Wal-Mart parking lot, a car radio plays a country ballad about a 
"porch-swing state of mind." Outside the store's entrance, a vendor sells corn 
dogs and cold sodas. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a woman gently coaxes her young daughter into getting off the small 
merry-go-round; two rides are enough, she says. "Mommy's got to go shopping 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Reluctantly, the little girl dismounts and tags along into the store. Her pout 
gives way to a grin as a smiling woman greets her with "Hi, Honey!" and fixes a 
happy-face sticker on her hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have Many Functions 
</P>
<P>
Anyone entering the Wal-Mart in this east Texas town -- and Wal-Marts elsewhere 
-- encounters such a person. The people greeters welcome shoppers, give advice 
on where to find things and mark merchandise being carried in for returns or 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
On the way out of some Wal-Marts, exit greeters thank people for coming while 
keeping an eye out for receipts to make sure there is no shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
The people-greeting practice is one of many ingredients in Wal-Mart Stores 
Inc.'s highly successful recipe for retailing. 
</P>
<P>
Staffing entrances and exits is not unheard of at other stores, particularly at 
discount houses with heavy traffic. What sets Wal-Mart's greeters apart is the 
way they handle the task. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Feel Bullied 
</P>
<P>
Customers in some high-volume stores feel bullied when employees demand that 
they reveal the contents of parcels, for instance, but not in Wal-Marts. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart "associates," as the company calls its employees, give the impression 
that the security element of people-greeting is secondary to being a friendly 
host or hostess. They appear to enjoy passing the time with patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"I get to see everybody who comes to Wal-Mart, and everybody in Upshur County 
comes to Wal-Mart sooner or later," says Peggy Smith, on duty at the entrance 
of the Gilmer Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 39-year-old Gilmer resident who won an award for being the most 
courteous employee in the county in February, speaks proudly about working at 
Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
She's grateful to have the job. Other people around Gilmer, a town of some 
6,500 people about 120 miles east of Dallas and the Upshur County seat, are 
less fortunate, due to deep staff cuts at a local steel mill and the prolonged 
slump in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not All Are Suited 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart store managers say not all associates are suited to people-greeting 
duty. Besides friendliness and maturity, useful traits are patience and perhaps 
a touch of inquisitiveness, some say. 
</P>
<P>
Retirees supplementing their fixed incomes are frequently found doing stints on 
Wal-Mart's hospitality patrol. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, 68-year-old Jack Butler, says being a people greeter at the 
Wal-Mart in Duncanville, Tex., fits his needs fine. After 20 years working in 
the warehouse of a tractor company, he enjoys having less physically demanding 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of manning Wal-Mart doors came from one of the hourly associates. Sam 
Walton, company founder and chairman, liked the suggestion, and made it a 
company-wide practice.

<P>
Betty Muller has mopped up after dozens of storms during the 23 years she and 
her husband have run the oceanfront ClayDon Motor Lodge, but she said the one 
that ripped through the Outer Banks last month may prompt her to pack it in. 
</P>
<P>
The storm wiped out eight of the motel's 24 units. One blue-and-white cottage 
floated out to sea and another was driven into the sand at a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
What really hurt, she said, was that it also ruined the Mullers' own apartment, 
forcing them to move into an unheated house across the beach road. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be 60 years old," Muller said, "and I can't take too much of this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damage Put at $4.6 Million 
</P>
<P>
The storm that began March 7 did not have the quick brutality of a hurricane, 
but ceaselessly battered the shore for four days. By the time the rain, surging 
waves and 45-m.p.h. gusts subsided, at least $4.6-million worth of property was 
lost along the delicate beaches of Dare County, a popular tourist area that 
stretches from communities such as Duck in the north to the southern tip of 
Hatteras Island. 
</P>
<P>
The storm also reshaped the beaches -- Oregon Inlet, just north of Hatteras 
Island, lost 200 feet of width overnight -- and rekindled debate over the 
extent to which man should intervene to protect the eroding shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely to fuel debate over a proposal to ban new commercial construction 
on the Nags Head beachfront, and over the issue of reinforcing the Bonner 
Bridge over Oregon Inlet, which has been filling in at the rate of 180 feet a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggests Using Tax Money 
</P>
<P>
The March storm damage led one county commissioner to propose using $2.1 
million from the 3% county occupancy tax for a new program of beach 
replenishment. 
</P>
<P>
It also could bring a major test of North Carolina's ban on sea walls. Unlike 
neighboring Virginia or South Carolina, North Carolina endorses the view of 
Duke University marine geologist Orrin H. Pilkey Jr., and others, that such 
structures ultimately harm the beach more than they protect it. 
</P>
<P>
Pilkey, who inspected the Outer Banks after the most recent storm, acknowledged 
that bulkheads would have lessened the damage but said they temporarily protect 
a few property owners at an unacceptable cost to others. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely proud of the fact that we allowed those buildings to fall in," 
he said in a telephone interview from his office in Durham. "It indicates that 
we're saving our beaches for future generations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pool Breaks Apart 
</P>
<P>
That sort of argument does not wash with Bob Hagar, manager of the Mariner 
Motel in Kill Devil Hills, whose oceanfront swimming pool broke apart during 
one recent storm. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance does not cover the pool, and Hagar said he also will spend $70,000 
this year trucking in sand to replenish the motel's beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
Hagar wants to sink a barge offshore to form a protective barrier, although he 
concedes that could hurt his neighbors' beaches. Failing that, he would like to 
pump in sand from the ocean floor, something he said hotels in Virginia are 
allowed to do. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said: "All we've bought is just time." 
</P>
<P>
Some hoteliers think differently. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing here that happened that wasn't expected," said Jim Edwards, a 
self-described Pilkey disciple. "The only thing that was unexpected was that it 
happened sooner than anyone thought . . . . If you want to play the game, you 
take the risks." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards owns two motels across the road from the beach. "Before I die, I'm 
going to have oceanfront property," he joked. It is a line often heard here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dozens Move Homes 
</P>
<P>
Some property owners have tried to avoid it -- to no avail. Along the Outer 
Banks, dozens of people have moved their houses back from the ocean to avoid 
flooding or worse. One home has been moved back 600 feet in the last 100 years, 
but because of erosion, it sits on the beach today. 
</P>
<P>
Big dollars are at stake in whatever decisions are made. As in other 
communities along the nation's coastlines, a development boom is on in Dare 
County. Condominiums are springing up along once-vacant beaches, and land 
prices are rising 30% a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that's going up faster is cocaine," said Dare County tax 
assessor Donald Hux. "If Dare County prices go up at this rate, drug smugglers 
will stop smuggling drugs and start buying our property. It's easier."

FISHERMEN USING DYNAMITE ARE DESTROYING REEFS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL DIASTER LOOMING IN TANZANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By BUCHIZYA MSETEKA, Reuters 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Explosions just off Tanzania's shoreline signal the coming of the daily catch 
of fish -- and a looming environmental disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Government biologists estimate that perhaps 80% of the coral reefs that run the 
length of Tanzania's Indian Ocean coastline have been destroyed by fishermen 
using dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
There is little the government can do about it, however. Cash-strapped Tanzania 
has no money to pay fishing police. 
</P>
<P>
"The fisheries division alone cannot fight dynamite-fishing in the current 
economic crisis so long as dynamite remains accessible," said one official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Since Early '70s 
</P>
<P>
Using dynamite to kill fish became popular in the early 1970s, when various 
guerrilla movements in southern Africa brought large supplies of explosives 
into Tanzania, where they had bases. Much of it found its way onto the local 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, dynamite costs just $3.85 a stick while a fishing net costs about 
$120, or about three times the monthly salary of a senior civil servant. 
Explosives are easily bought at building sites and quarries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all very well for the government to come down on us, but we have to make 
a living and support our families," said Ahmed Salim Mussa, a fisherman in Dar 
es Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
Even with dynamite, it is hard to make ends meet by fishing in Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Own Their Boats 
</P>
<P>
Since few fishermen have their own boats, most keep only a fraction of their 
catch -- the rest of the fish to the boat owner. 
</P>
<P>
The boat must be fast enough to move out of range once the fisherman throws one 
or two sticks of dynamite overboard. In Dar es Salaam, at least one or two 
fishermen are injured in explosions every month, but no deaths have been 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fish landed this way are damaged, and biologists say that in the 
long run, dynamiting means there will be fewer and fewer fish caught in 
Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reef Destruction 
</P>
<P>
"Reef destruction means young fish will not have a suitable habitat to grow in, 
and fish will not come to breed here," said one Natural Resources Ministry 
official. 
</P>
<P>
They say the dead coral that litters Tanzanian beaches points to another 
problem. The same tides and currents that wash it ashore after the explosions 
are eroding the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
At resorts near Dar es Salaam, the beaches are washing away at a rate of 12 
feet a year; 80% of the Bahari beach is gone and erosion has damaged the 
foundation of the Africana Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stiff Penalties Planned 
</P>
<P>
The government plans to set stiffer penalties for dynamiting fish -- the 
maximum now is a six-month jail term. 
</P>
<P>
"But tough laws will not stop these fishermen from using dynamite, as they have 
little alternative," said Bjorge Paulsson, a Swedish environmentalist working 
with Tanzania's National Environment Management Council.

CACOPHONY MARKS IRAQ ANIMAL MARKET

BAGHDAD, Iraq

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weekly animal market is one of the most popular places in Baghdad, a 
cacophony of trilling songbirds, barking dogs and bleating goats, where the 
mundane mixes with the exotic. 
</P>
<P>
The souk il-hayawanat, as it's known, unfolds every Friday morning outside the 
Mosque of the Caliphs, across the street from the main bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
Six months after the cease-fire in its eight-year war with Iran, Iraq doesn't 
have the hard currency needed to pay for the imported videocassette recorders 
and tape decks that are found elsewhere in the Arab world. Those that are 
available generally are out of the reach of most people, and many stores are 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for a Bargain 
</P>
<P>
But the 300-yard stretch of sidewalk where the animal bazaar is held throngs 
with Iraqis looking for a bargain in pets, a watchdog or a goat to provide 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
Like other bazaars, this one is divided by specialty, with carrier pigeons 
taking up the most space. Buyers squeeze the neck, splay the feet, unfurl the 
wings and look in the eyes for any signs of sickness. 
</P>
<P>
One customer, Najib, 35, says it's all in the nose. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have (one with) a big nose," he said. "That means it's a strong bird. 
If you see a big nose, that's the best bird." 
</P>
<P>
He was looking for a carrier pigeon to cover the 255 miles between Baghdad and 
the southern port of Basra. A good one can cost about $90. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Myriad Birds, Fish 
</P>
<P>
But there also are nightingales, parakeets, turkeys, geese, roosters, chicks, 
parrots, exotic marsh birds, falcons, ducks, finches and goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
One section is taken up with dozens of vendors selling little aquarium fish 
swimming in glass jars stacked on benches. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the menagerie, there is all the paraphernalia needed to care 
for the animals: massive bird cages, mounds of seed and fish tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd attracts other hawkers selling sesame cakes, hearts of palm and even 
lucky stones. 
</P>
<P>
The people inevitably spill into the traffic swirling past just feet away. Some 
cars slow while their occupants gawk at the animals. 
</P>
<P>
A policeman adds his bullhorn to the din as he prods traffic and pedestrians to 
keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, someone weaving through the cars with a seven-foot bird cage on 
his shoulders will bring traffic to a screeching halt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Most Expensive at $250 
</P>
<P>
Some customers come to buy white fantailed pigeons to decorate the garden at 
about $250. But even these are not the most expensive birds on sale. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of white parrots with yellow crests from the Soviet Union drew a huge 
crowd with their ability to say "Papa, Kaka and Yacouv," apparently the names 
of their owners. The asking price was a hefty $750. 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd reached its thickest around noon, the inevitable accidents 
occurred. Birds were trampled underfoot or someone holding one was jostled and 
the bird flew free. 
</P>
<P>
One parakeet escaped and lodged on the gates of the mosque. Orange peels lobbed 
at it failed to budge it. Even the amplified noon prayer booming from 
loudspeakers in the ancient minaret barely ruffled a feather. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget it," said someone in the crowd. "It's gone to pray."

FOR A $75 FARE, AIRLINE STAGES MYSTERY FLIGHTS 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An hour ago, the 18 passengers at the back of the aircraft had no idea where 
they would be flying to. 
</P>
<P>
Like hundreds of Belgians each weekend, they simply turned up at Brussels 
airport with round-trip tickets to fly the national airline Sabena to a mystery 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
Their $75 tickets will take them to one of 15 European cities from London to 
Milan for a stay of 40 minutes or so before catching the same plane back to 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
Sabena says it devised the "Air Promenades" program to promote air travel, fill 
empty seats on weekends and encourage people to stick with the airline in 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"The promotional impact is fantastic. In Europe, people fly much less than in 
the United States. Half of all Americans have flown, here the figure is 15%," 
said Achille Moerman, Sabena's European head of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Promenaders can buy tickets up to Friday afternoon, when Sabena checks the 
number of seats available -- usually between 50 and 500 -- and decides who will 
be flying where. 
</P>
<P>
Each passenger then receives a brief call telling them when to be at the 
airport. On arrival, they check in at a special desk and are given a bright 
blue badge with their boarding passes. Only then do they learn their 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one man who's been four times already and several who have been more 
than once. Whenever we get repeat bookings we try our best to send them to a 
different destination," Moerman said. 
</P>
<P>
"After you've taken meals and everything else into account, we don't make a 
profit on the fares. It's the same amount as you'd pay for a meal in a 
restaurant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabena surveys since the program began early this year show that the majority 
of Air Promenaders have never flown before and that most travel because they 
like the idea of flying rather than to buy duty-free goods. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue the scheme until we run out of passengers. It allows you to see 
the exciting, international view of air transport," Moerman added. 
</P>
<P>
The not-so-exciting international view of air transport -- an air controllers' 
strike -- meant that the 18 Air Promenaders on a recent Saturday flight to Nice 
left more than an hour late. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think it's crazy to buy a ticket and not know where you're going. 
I like flying a lot, but you don't get the chance to do so in my job. This is 
only my fourth flight in 20 years," said bank teller Andre Koeckelberghs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that expensive, considering what you have to pay for flights 
normally. I'm not sure if we'll be doing it every week, though," he said as the 
Boeing 737 cruised over the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be no shortage of passengers willing to take part, even if not 
all of them look thrilled when the plane leaves the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first ever flight. It's an experience, but I'm a little frightened. 
I'm not sure if they've checked the engines," said schoolteacher Martin 
Lambrechts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a fantastic idea, especially for those who haven't flown before. 
You're getting the same service as those who've paid the full fare," said 
Captain Raymond Aelvoet. 
</P>
<P>
The Promenaders on the 90-minute journey spent the time gazing out of the 
windows or working their way through the in-flight meal before the plane 
circled low over the Cote D'Azur and landed at Nice airport, bathed in warm 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
After picking up their boarding passes for the return trip, they wandered 
around the terminal, where their badges attracted much attention from other 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean they've come all this way just to go back again immediately? They're 
mad," said one French businessman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea, but it's a shame you can't go out and visit the town 
a bit," ventured his companion. 
</P>
<P>
Just 20 minutes later, it was time to go home. Still sporting their blue 
badges, the promenaders rejoined the aircraft, to tackle their second meal in 
three hours.

Starting today, most Americans will be able to enjoy more evening golf, 
cookouts or other events, thanks to an extra hour of daylight first instituted 
as a wartime measure but now used primarily for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
That's right -- it's time to spring forward to daylight-saving time. 
</P>
<P>
The change takes effect at 2 a.m. today, although most people will set their 
clocks ahead before retiring on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't will be an hour late for church or other appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Daylight-saving time was introduced during World War I in an effort to save 
fuel by reducing the need for lights in the evening.

The Singapore army will hold a series of military training maneuvers in Taiwan 
this month, a spokesman for Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The war games could involve as many as 10,000 Singaporean troops and will be 
the largest single military exercise staged in Taiwan by the small city-state, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore has long used Taiwan army facilities to train its troops, but both 
sides have publicly played down their military cooperation until recently. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore has no diplomatic ties with Taipei but unofficial bilateral links are 
strong.

The East St. Louis school board is warning half of its 1,800 employees of 
possible layoffs in a cost-cutting move that should save the district $11 
million in the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the savings, the district will still have debts totaling more than $17 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The district sent layoff notices last week to 390 teachers and 515 
non-certified employees, everyone hired since Jan. 1, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Elmo Bush said he hopes to reduce the eventual number of 
layoffs, through such means as attrition, to 280 teachers and 300 to 400 
non-certified workers. 
</P>

East St. Louis, the state's fourth-largest district with 16,000 students, has a

OWENS VALLEY BRUSH FIRES BURN 1,000 ACRES

<TEXT>
<P>
Brush fires sweeping through two areas of the Owens Valley blackened almost 
1,000 acres and destroyed some structures, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The larger of the two blazes, east of Mt. Whitney, was ignited Friday by embers 
from an earlier fire carried on winds of up to 50 m.p.h., said Brian Miller, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
The previous fire began March 21 and was controlled the next day, but 
smoldering embers were revived and swept up by the gusting winds, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
By late Saturday afternoon, the fire had charred 730 acres of dry sagebrush, 
one home and two travel trailers on one ranch and a mobile home on another 
ranch, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was 90% contained at 5 p.m. and full containment was expected by this 
morning, California Department of Forestry spokesman Will Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
As firefighters closed a ring around the fire, the Tuttle Creek campground 
remained evacuated Saturday night. About one dozen families voluntarily left 
their homes in the Granite View area, which was not directly threatened, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire crept to within four miles west of Lone Pine and several hundred feet 
from several homes in Granite View, prompting three or four families there to 
evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters hoped for favorable winds and containment lines would prevent 
further damage, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 250 firefighters were involved in fighting the fire, most of it on 
federal Bureau of Land Management land. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service, state Department of Forestry, BLM personnel, the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power and the state Office of Emergency 
Services among other agencies were involved in the operations, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The second fire, 60 miles away and three miles east of Bishop, started Friday 
afternoon and destroyed 250 acres but was contained by Saturday. Cause of the 
blaze was unknown and was under investigation, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 to 30 panicked cattle died when the fire drove them into the Owens 
River. "Half of them drowned, the others burned," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire came within a mile of destroying the historic Laws Railroad Museum, a 
ghost town, he said.

SIGHTINGS INCREASE AS HOUSES PUSH INTO WILDERNESS; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY DEVELOPMENT, COYOTES COLLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In San Clemente, coyotes serenade each other from the front lawns of startled 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
In East Tustin, the sight of the coyotes running through one neighborhood has 
prompted residents to post "Beware Coyote" signs. 
</P>
<P>
And in Fullerton, coyotes have become so brazen at Orange County's Craig 
Regional Park that they stand and glare at approaching rangers before calmly 
retreating into the brush. 
</P>
<P>
As new housing tracts push steadily into the shrinking wilderness of Orange 
County, coyotes are turning up at an ever-increasing rate. 
</P>
<P>
And with February and March, their mating season, coyotes are more visible -- 
and louder -- than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear them howling so much that it's like an animal powwow," said Linda 
Emerson, 29, a San Clemente homemaker whose property abuts open hills. 
</P>
<P>
Although no figures are available on exactly how many coyotes inhabit the 
county, an indication of their abundance can be gleaned from the few agencies 
that log coyote-related calls. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Animal Control officials, for example, receive up to 100 coyote 
complaints a year; there were virtually none a decade ago. Most of the calls 
are coming from foothill communities, where the county's development is 
concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Calls 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente alone, officials have logged more than 60 calls in the last 
year, most from the city's new housing tracts, which snake into rolling hills. 
</P>
<P>
Many coyote sightings have also been reported nearer the coast. Coyotes have 
been known to run down the middle of streets in Laguna Beach. And in Dana 
Point, coyotes inhabiting a deep canyon ringed by development awaken residents 
at night with their howls. 
</P>
<P>
"We do hear them approximately three nights out of seven," said Chris 
Christianson, 26, a resident of Dana Point's Thunderbird tract, which overlooks 
a canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not really that much of a problem, other than they disturb you in the 
evening with their howls." 
</P>
<P>
Cowardly creatures by nature, coyotes for the most part are not a threat to 
people, wildlife biologists said. But they can become vicious if they begin 
relying upon neighborhood food sources and, in the process, lose their fear of 
people, said Bruce Cahill, a Los Angeles County wildlife biologist who is a 
consultant for Orange and other Southland counties. 
</P>
<P>
"They steal lunch bags from children. Adults are threatened if they come up on 
a mother and her pups," Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign of trouble is when the coyotes start getting into garbage, said 
Tom Paulek, a state Fish and Game wildlife biologist in Long Beach. Next, they 
start going into back yards and gobbling up leftover pet food. Then they start 
gobbling up the pets. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Paulek and Cahill said, coyotes become so dependent on these 
artificial food sources that they lose their desire to hunt for small game. And 
when this happens, small children can become targets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handful of Incidents 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, there have been a handful of incidents since 1980 in 
which coyotes have attacked and injured children; the most serious occurred in 
1981, when a young girl was attacked and killed by a coyote in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, there have been four reported coyote attacks on children in 
recent years; three in San Clemente in 1983 and 1986 and one in Yorba Linda in 
1987. No one was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Coyote attacks on pets have occurred in such heavily urbanized areas as Craig 
Park in Fullerton, a 124-acre preserve surrounded by shopping centers, housing 
tracts and freeways. In recent months, coyotes there have killed several small 
dogs left unleashed, against park rules, said Joe Cooke, the park's senior 
ranger. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke added that the park's coyotes -- numbering perhaps half a dozen -- have 
also become so bold that they pause to watch as rangers drive up. A coyote's 
normal reaction to approaching people is to bolt immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers at two other county parks, Carbon Canyon Regional Park in Brea and 
Irvine Regional Park in Orange, are also reporting increasingly brazen coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike mountain lions and other large wild animals -- whose populations have 
diminished as development has encroached into their habitat -- coyotes seem to 
thrive on close human contact and have eluded man's efforts to control their 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Studies by the Los Angeles County Agricultural Commission have shown a coyote 
population as dense as 50 animals per square mile near new developments; they 
average one animal per 10 square miles in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
The population explosion is fueled by the new housing developments that offer 
an ideal combination of additional food and water for coyotes, Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
And the greenbelt areas that now accompany most large housing tracts afford 
"perfect habitat" for coyotes, he said: "They use the greenbelts for refuge 
from jumping in and out of back yards. And the coyote doesn't have to worry 
about some farmer protecting his crops." 
</P>
<P>
But what is good for the coyote is not good for man. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have this romantic view of the coyote, but coyote and man in large 
quantities are just not compatible," Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
Mass killing of the animals is not a solution, Cahill and other wildlife 
experts said, because it is neither desired nor politically acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Limited kills, which were conducted in San Clemente in 1983 and 1986 after 
toddlers were attacked, had the short-term effect of weeding out "troublemaker" 
coyotes and deterring others, said San Clemente Fire Marshal Gene Bagnall. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we did this, we left kills in the field to dissuade other 
coyotes from coming in," Bagnall said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a police sharpshooter patrol tracked and killed 11 coyotes; following 
the 1986 attack, a hunter killed 22 more. 
</P>
<P>
But Bagnall added that the limited kills are only a stopgap. Eventually -- 
perhaps as soon as this year -- the city will have to send a hunter out to get 
rid of new problem coyotes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The best solution to the problem is educating the public on how to keep food 
away from coyotes, Bagnall and the other wildlife experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Bagnall ticked off a few do's and don'ts: "Don't leave dog food out. Don't 
leave your cat out. Put lids on your trash cans." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, never deliberately feed the coyotes. One man in Glendale, for 
instance, used to feed the neighborhood coyotes more than 100 pounds of pet 
food per week, Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente enacted an ordinance prohibiting people from feeding coyotes, as 
has Los Angeles County and several L.A. County communities. 
</P>
<P>
When coyotes are not stirring up problems, many people enjoy having them around 
and listening to their plaintive wail. 
</P>
<P>
One San Clemente man expressed disappointment, in fact, when coyotes failed to 
turn up near his home when he entertained out-of-town guests last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked our visitors after their first night if they had heard the coyotes, 
and they said no," said the man, who did not want to give his name. "I had 
wanted them to put on a show."

5 IN SOUTHLAND JOIN LATINOS IN SUIT ALLEGING CUSTOMS BIAS

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alfonso Rivera, a criminal investigator with the U. S. Customs Service in San 
Diego, said he was tired of working for Anglo bosses with "an open-door policy 
and a closed mind." In January, he joined 10 other veteran Latino agents and 
inspectors from throughout the country in filing an unfair discrimination 
lawsuit against the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, a 17-year veteran of the Customs Service, said, "The policy of 
discrimination should have been challenged a long, long time ago." Five of the 
11 plaintiffs in the suit work in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Rivera, the plaintiffs include two other investigators working 
out of the San Diego office of the special agent in charge and two inspectors 
who work at the Otay and San Ysidro ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, which was filed in U. S. District Court in Washington, alleges 
that since about 1980, when the Ronald Reagan Administration took power, 
Customs officials "have actively sought to reduce the number of Hispanic 
employees at upper-level management." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figures Cited 
</P>
<P>
As an example, attorneys for the agents and inspectors said that, in 1980, nine 
Latinos with a GS-15 job rating were working for the Customs Service. Now there 
are only three, they said. Of the 49 senior executive service employees with 
the agency, none is Latino, the attorneys said. By contrast, 25% off all 
employees at entry-level positions are Latino, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino employees are represented by attorneys from the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund office in Chicago. The complaint names 27 
defendants, including Nicholas F. Brady, who, as secretary of the Treasury, 
administers the Customs Service; William Von Raab, commissioner of the Customs 
Service, and Quintin L. Villanueva Jr., regional commissioner for the Pacific 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Shimkowski, Customs spokesman in Washington, said officials will not 
comment on the lawsuit while it is pending. 
</P>
<P>
MALDEF attorney Ruben Castillo said the experiences and complaints of the 
Latino Customs employees in San Diego are representative of the complaints 
heard from other Latinos throughout the country. He is waiting for the court to 
certify the complaint as a class-action lawsuit so MALDEF can represent about 
1,760 Latinos in the Customs Service, which has 15,632 employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, 48, a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War, is especially vocal in his 
allegations of unfair treatment. Much of his criticism is directed at Kenneth 
Ingleby, special agent in charge of the Customs Service's San Diego office of 
criminal investigations. Ingleby, who is not named as a defendant in the 
lawsuit, failed to return several phone calls to his office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favored Treatment Alleged 
</P>
<P>
According to Rivera and others interviewed, Ingleby frequently displays favored 
treatment toward Anglo agents. They also said that, like other Customs 
supervisors throughout the Southwest, supervisors in the San Diego office of 
criminal investigations use Spanish-speaking agents in ways that restrict their 
opportunities for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish-speaking agents said being bilingual is often a liability rather than 
an asset. The lawsuit alleges that Latino agents are routinely assigned to 
mundane duties such as listening in on wiretaps involving Spanish-speaking 
defendants rather than to cases that provide opportunities for career 
enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
"These (wiretap) assignments are involuntary, involve unusually long hours . . 
. and result in the reassignment of career-enhancing cases to non-Hispanic 
employees," the lawsuit says. " . . . The monitoring of Spanish-language 
wiretaps is not rewarded with benefits or promotions." 
</P>
<P>
"After the wiretap is done, you get an 'attaboy' letter and are sent home. . . 
. The Anglo agents get all the glory and are promoted," Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Customs employees said their hopes for a successful lawsuit were buoyed by a 
federal judge's ruling last fall in a similar suit brought by Latino FBI agents 
against that agency. After a lengthy trial, the judge ruled that the FBI 
systematically discriminated against Latino agents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many of Same Complaints 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, Latino FBI agents lodged many of the same complaints echoed by 
customs investigators and inspectors. They complained about being assigned to 
Spanish-language wiretap assignments, testifying that those assignments are 
among the most tedious for FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the customs agents interviewed said they expect reprisals as a result 
of initiating the lawsuit. Richard Medina, an internal affairs supervisor 
working out of Ingleby's office, was recently transferred to Washington for 
temporary duty. Medina, who is a plaintiff in the suit and a critic of 
Ingleby's management style, was reassigned to Washington for 120 days for 
"attitudinal adjustment," said an Anglo agent who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these people in San Diego and elsewhere have a lot of courage putting 
their names on a lawsuit against their employer," said attorney Castillo. 
"Richard's transfer is the type of transfer that concerns us. We see a pattern 
of transfers like these, which are used to hurt the progression of Hispanics in 
the Customs Service." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also charges that Latinos are concentrated in "Hispanic areas" of 
the Southwest, Pacific Coast and the Southeast, namely Miami. It says that, 
while these three geographical areas account for 44% of the total customs work 
force, 83% of all Latino employees are assigned to the three areas. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos "are not considered for promotion in non-Hispanic areas" such as the U. 
S.-Canada border, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned Down Twice 
</P>
<P>
Charles Mazon, 44 and a customs inspector supervisor at Otay Mesa, has worked 
for the agency 17 years and was the first Latino to be named port director at 
Tecate. He said he was twice rejected for promotions to jobs at the 
Washington-Canada border. On both occasions, the positions were filled by 
lower-ranking Anglo inspectors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My first application was for a position at Port Angeles, Wash., where there 
was a vacancy for a GS-11 port director. It was a merit promotion; I was a 
GS-11 at the time . . . but I was not selected. A GS-9 inspector who was Anglo 
was selected instead," Mazon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The following year, in 1986, I applied for two GS-11 openings in Vancouver. I 
was up for GS-12 at the time, so I was willing to take the demotion. But I was 
bypassed again, and two lower-level inspectors were selected. One was Anglo, 
and I'm not sure about the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazon said he filed two equal employment opportunity complaints with the 
Customs Service as a result of being turned down for the three positions but 
has yet to hear from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Mazon, who is looked to for leadership by other Latino customs inspectors at 
the San Ysidro and Otay ports, said each disappointment has left a bitter 
aftertaste with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want special treatment. The only thing that we want is a fair shake. 
That's all we ask," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Anglo Support 
</P>
<P>
The agents and inspectors have received support from some Anglo colleagues, 
Mazon said, and some of them have offered to testify on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten calls of support from Anglo agents in Denver and other places. 
There's a good possibility that some Anglo supervisors will testify for us," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Leslie, 50, is an equal employment counselor for customs inspectors at the 
San Ysidro port of entry. The 16-year veteran of the Customs Service said he is 
working with district Director Allan Rappoport to increase the number of Latino 
inspectors at San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
"We have almost 285 inspectors in San Ysidro, but only about 52 are Hispanic," 
Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Ysidro port was "full of bigotry" when he arrived in 1978 after serving 
at the Canal Zone, Leslie said. The dissatisfaction among Latino inspectors 
came to a head in 1983 when they banded together to file a class action 
complaint with Rappoport. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1983, the port director promoted three Anglo supervisors when the No. 1 
person on the list was an Hispanic," Leslie said. "When we complained, he told 
us that, if we wanted to get promoted, we could go work at the Calexico port." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Troubled 
</P>
<P>
The Latino inspectors took their complaints to Rappoport, who subsequently 
agreed to promote three Latino supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Rappoport, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, said he is not troubled by 
Mazon and Inspector Victor Sanchez's involvement in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're ventilating their concerns. . . . You're not going to make 
everybody happy all the time, so why take it personally? My own personal 
reputation is one who is not a biased person," Rappoport said. " . . . No group 
of people has come to me and told me there are serious problems here. . . . Our 
policy here is to recruit quality people, not just fill numbers. I try not to 
promote someone just because of race." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30% Latino 
</P>
<P>
Rappoport said that, according to a recent in-house survey, 30% of all 
employees in his district are Latino. He also denied charges that Latinos are 
under-represented in the supervisorial ranks at the San Ysidro and Otay ports 
of entry. According to Rappoport's figures, two of the four GS-13 supervisors 
at both ports are Latinos, and four of 17 GS-12 supervisors, or 24%, are 
Latinos, as are nine of 39, or 23%, GS-11 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The total representation of Latinos in these ranks is higher than the 13.4% 
representation in the local civilian work force, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo said MALDEF's research shows that, more often than not, the Customs 
Service's employee promotion policy "does not reflect what other agencies and 
companies are doing, namely promoting Hispanics into supervisorial and 
management roles." 
</P>
<P>
"We allege that this is intentional. It doesn't represent equal employment 
opportunity," said Castillo, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subjected to Slurs 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Inspector Robert Ramirez, 42, a 13-year customs veteran, said Latino 
agents are commonly subjected to racial slurs from non-Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many comments made by my peers that really bother me. I've heard 
them say that we are nothing but greasers or dumb Mexicans," said Ramirez, who 
also works as a recruiter for customs inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not all Latino agents and inspectors are supporting the lawsuit. Rivera 
and Mazon said that at least one local man who was a party to the complaint is 
having second thoughts about proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
"They're dangling a carrot in front of him, promising him a promotion. Now he 
says that he doesn't want to do anything to hurt his chances of moving up," 
Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Latinos do not want to get involved because they are new employees and on 
probation, and still others are afraid of retribution, Mazon said. And many of 
the younger Latinos who are not part of the lawsuit "are afraid of what their 
Anglo friends are going to say about them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As an equal-employment counselor and veteran of many discrimination battles, 
Leslie said he is saddened by the younger agents' attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are following in our footsteps," he said. "The pattern that we set 
now with this lawsuit is the pattern that they're going to follow. These guys 
don't realize that we're trying to open doors for them -- doors that have been 
closed to us for many years."

MAY REDUCE NUMBER OF CESAREANS;

A new technique that bounces laser light off brain cells to monitor the amount 
of oxygen reaching a fetus could help prevent brain damage and reduce the 
number of Cesarean sections, a researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
The technique has shown good results in tests on 12 patients at the University 
of Bonn Gynecological Hospital, said Dr. Stephan Schmidt, who heads the 
research team. "Its main advantage is that it's a gentle monitoring method 
which can give continuous readings without touching the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a long way to go before we make definite conclusions, but the 
preliminary results are very promising." 
</P>
<P>
The relatively cheap technique -- Schmidt's model costs about $43,000 -- beams 
extremely low levels of harmless infrared light into the fetal brain. The light 
reflected back provides information about the supply of oxygen in brain cells; 
the information is displayed graphically on a desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely important to us to be able to gauge the level of oxygen in the 
tissue cells as often as possible," Schmidt said. Earlier techniques required 
blood samples from the fetus, which "has the disadvantage of being a 
single-point test and has to be repeated at short intervals. 
</P>
<P>
"A continuous record is far more preferable and less cumbersome." 
</P>
<P>
In 20 out of 100 cases, he said, heart monitors indicate the possibility of 
oxygen deficiency, but only five of those 20 have symptoms that would actually 
require Cesarean delivery, he said. "With our technique we hope to be able to 
determine which of those infants do not really require a Cesarean section."

Utah State University researchers Frank Salisbury and Bruce Bugbee see beyond 
hybrid wheat thriving in hydroponic gardens to a day when their experiments 
will help feed human colonies on the moon and Mars. 
</P>
<P>
It is that vision -- of mankind planted safely beyond the pale of earthly 
limitations -- that has kept the two plant scientists firm in their commitment 
to space agriculture despite tight funding and the knowledge that they may not 
live to see their research implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"It's long-range research that really has to be done now to be used later," 
said Bugbee, 38, the principal researcher for the university's controlled 
ecological life-support system project. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's just plain interesting," he added. "Something as complex as a closed 
life-support system is just fascinating. We're trying to duplicate all the 
functions of planet Earth in a relatively small capsule." 
</P>
<P>
Bugbee and Salisbury, 62, who serves on the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's aerospace medical advisory committee, say it could be 30 years 
or more before a permanent human colony is established on the moon and another 
decade beyond that before Mars is settled. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, they believe that their work will survive them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can seriously talk about a permanent colony on the moon or 
Mars without talking about (the life-support project)," Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Plants raised under hydroponics are grown in nutrient-rich solutions rather 
than soil. 
</P>
<P>
Although funding for the hydroponic project -- about $130,000 a year since it 
was approved by NASA in 1981 -- is minuscule compared with the billions spent 
on the nation's manned space flight program, Salisbury and Bugbee point with 
pride to its accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Simulating as closely as possible the conditions of a lunar or Martian colonial 
farm through variations in lighting and atmosphere, the project has grown a 
Mexican dwarf variety of wheat with yields of 60 grams of edible wheat per 
square yard per day. 
</P>
<P>
That is five times the estimated world record of 12 to 14 grams, Salisbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury and Bugbee, believing that they are near the theoretical production 
limits for wheat in an extraterrestrial colony setting, say they will next turn 
their attention to wheat's performance in zero gravity -- a crucial 
consideration for the day when mankind embarks on space voyages too long to be 
sustained by stored food. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, they are preparing an experiment for a future space shuttle 
mission. NASA has approved the project, but it has yet to be scheduled for 
flight, the two said in telephone interviews from the school's campus in Logan, 
60 miles north of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food and Pure Air 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury and Bugbee say a space farm could feed the Mars mission's crew and 
purify air and water supplies. For example, a 13-square-yard space farm could 
feed one person indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Looking beyond exploration to colonization of the moon and Mars, the 
researchers believe that a farm about the size of a football field could 
provide the food and oxygen needs of 100 or more people. 
</P>
<P>
A hydroponic space farm, unlike those on Earth, would not be maintained as one 
huge unit but would be made up of a number of self-contained compartments to 
guard against the spread of plant diseases. Further, it probably would produce 
far more food than needed, ranging from 20% to 100% more, as a hedge against 
unexpected losses.

BROWN BEARS ETERNALLY PLAYFUL, SAY RESEARCHERS

PACK CREEK, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A husband and wife who study brown bears in the Alaska wilderness believe the 
huge carnivores are among a small group of intelligent animals that are playful 
all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Brown bears play games with each other and appear captivated by tree limbs, 
stumps, stones and tall grass. Their high jinks don't stop as they grow from 
cubs into adults, says Bob Fagen, an animal behavior specialist and associate 
professor of biometry at the University of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the brown bears of Pack Creek may be one of the rare species 
that play the same amount through all of their lives," Fagen said. 
</P>
<P>
That puts them in the company of chimpanzees, lions, wolves and several 
domestic animals, those Fagen calls "a small select group of intelligent, 
social, cultural species." 
</P>
<P>
"The bears stand out because they don't have a very cooperative relationship, 
like wolves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown bears are reputed loners. At Pack Creek they chase each other, snap and 
trade growls. Sometimes the growling turns into fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Fagen has spent four summers at Pack Creek, 30 miles south of Juneau on 
Admiralty Island, to observe about 30 bears that gather to catch spawning 
salmon. His wife, Johanna, a biologist, has spent three summers there. 
</P>
<P>
In July and August, the Fagens live in a tent on an island off the creek mouth 
with their 8-year-old son, Kevin, and a rotation of graduate students who help 
keep track of the bears. They monitor bears 12 to 15 hours a day from a tree 
stand, a tarpaulin-covered platform about 15 feet above ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interactions With People 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their studies of play, the Fagens monitor all the bears' 
movements and interactions with people. 
</P>
<P>
The records help wildlife officials determine how bears are affected by the 
crowds of people who show up every summer to photograph them. Bears disturbed 
by clicking shutters, overflying aircraft or other activity show changes in 
their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"The most sensitive indicator we know is play," Fagen said. "Play tends to be 
inhibited by any kind of stressful or strange experience." 
</P>
<P>
Though one researcher at Pack Creek thought the bears' play was inhibited when 
people were around, the Fagens say they have not found the same result. 
</P>
<P>
Johanna Fagen has watched cubs playing chasing games, and she saw an older bear 
lie on its back and roll a huge, rotted stump atop its upended paws. "They are 
very oriented to objects. They like to push and pull stones. They play-fight 
with a clump of grass or an overhanging branch." 
</P>
<P>
The Fagens saw an adult male and female sliding down a patch of snow, 
apparently in fun, during the mating season. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Fagen also suspects that bears indulge in pleasures humans might not 
recognize as such: rolling in dead fish, for instance. She said the bears seem 
to appreciate smell, being attracted to fish and gasoline and fond of rolling 
in a sawdust pile.

WESTSIDE DEVELOPMENT SPARKS A SQUABBLE; 
</P>
<P>
2 CITY AGENCIES CAUGHT IN A TRAFFIC JAM 
</P>

<P>
Elected city officials are critical of Los Angeles building inspectors for 
failing to force the developer of the Beverly Connection shopping center to 
install left-turn pockets and other traffic improvements at the chronically 
clogged intersection of Beverly and La Cienega boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is bigger than the Beverly Connection," said City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, who wrote the Department of Building and Safety to demand that it 
revoke the temporary certificate of occupancy that was issued when the shopping 
center opened in January. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Connection is on La Cienega Boulevard between Beverly Boulevard and 
3rd Street, across the street from the huge Beverly Center shopping mall and 
diagonally across from the newly opened Ma Maison Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions imposed by the Board of Zoning Appeals required that both Beverly 
and La Cienega boulevards be widened by five feet to allow for extra left-turn 
lanes, and that new signals be installed to regulate traffic in and out of both 
shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Music, Video Stores 
</P>
<P>
"Either Building and Safety is going to have to police better or there's going 
to be a radical transformation of who does what in the city," he said. "You 
cannot have conditions imposed by the Planning Department and totally ignored 
by Building and Safety." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Blumenfeld, Mayor Tom Bradley's planning aide, said that Bradley's office 
was also concerned about the Beverly Connection, where a supermarket and music 
and video stores have been open since January. 
</P>
<P>
With automobile congestion already a chronic problem in the area, she said that 
new stores in the Beverly Connection will only worsen traffic if the 
street-widening and double left-turn lanes required by the Board of Zoning 
Appeals are not installed. 
</P>
<P>
"This could have citywide implications if temporary certificates of occupancy 
are given pending completion of very significant improvements that have not 
been done," Blumenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the protests, the head of the city's Building Bureau said that little 
could have been done to prevent the opening of the Beverly Connection once 
construction was completed, especially because the site was previously occupied 
by another retail store. 
</P>
<P>
"In the legal sense they had the legal right to occupy the building," said Tim 
Taylor, chief of the Building Bureau. "That was a retail store and this is a 
retail store. There was really no need for a temporary certificate of 
occupancy, but they wanted one. If we revoke it they can fall back on the 
existing certificate of occupancy from years ago." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the growing tendency to require that developers take steps to 
deal with traffic and other disruptions before they can occupy their buildings 
has overburdened his department. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a very difficult enforcement problem for the Building Department to 
deal with," he said. "There's no question that conditions were imposed in this 
case. The question is, are they legally enforceable? That has not been tested 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Substantially Completed 
</P>
<P>
Russell Lane, the city's chief building inspector, agreed, saying that the 
municipal code allows him to issue a certificate of occupancy when a building 
is substantially completed. 
</P>
<P>
"That basically says there's no hazards involved," he said, adding that he has 
only 46 inspectors to monitor construction and remodeling of all major 
commercial buildings and large apartment houses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The street improvements are not under my jurisdiction," he said. "We're 
internally fighting that battle now as to who should enforce those off-site 
provisions. If I go out and inspect those street improvements, I'm broadening 
my authority by a great deal. My people don't have that expertise." 
</P>
<P>
But Yaroslavsky said that building inspectors will have to broaden their scope 
if the city is to limit its development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police the Conditions 
</P>
<P>
"This is the straw that broke the camel's back," he said of the Beverly 
Connection situation. "Either we're going to find a way for the Building and 
Safety Department to police the conditions" set by the Planning Department or 
we're going to "find some other department to do it, and I don't think it's an 
insurmountable task for any bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Blumenfeld, of Bradley's office, said that planning conditions are the best 
vehicle to regulate growth. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd need to have hundreds of people to make it mistake-free," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Bradley and Yaroslavsky came after two residents groups 
protested the decision to let a supermarket and video and music store open in 
the Beverly Connection in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gratified and pleased that the city takes this seriously," said Harald 
Hahn of the Burton Way Homeowners Assn., which has worked with the Beverly 
Wilshire Homeowners Assn. to limit development in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blocked Liquor License 
</P>
<P>
The two groups have temporarily blocked a liquor license for Ralphs market by 
arguing that there are already more than enough liquor outlets in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Since the stores opened, "the traffic is horrendous. There are traffic jams for 
a mile in every direction," he said. He added that "in a sense" he felt sorry 
for developer Avi Lerner "because he's got his money on the line and people 
can't get into his shopping center. Not very sorry, but a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lerner said that work on the required improvements has started 
and that it should be finished within two months. He also said there was no 
reason not to open the stores in January. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask what's better, closing Ralphs and displacing its patrons, or letting 
them shop at the store?" 
</P>
<P>
Referring to protests from the two residents' groups, he said, "This whole 
thing is nothing more than a cheap, spiteful shot . . . to basically make 
noise." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that work on the traffic improvements was complicated by the task 
of avoiding a maze of underground utility pipes that carry electricity, gas and 
telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
Exploratory work on the street-widening began more than a year ago, he said, 
adding that temporary certificates were created to allow for such scheduling 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
He said the work also was delayed by a city ban on street works between Nov. 15 
and Jan. 15.

BUSH SIGNALS WRONG TURN ON ROAD TO ARMS CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William H. Kincade and Jonathan L. A. Shrier, William H. Kincade teaches in 
Georgetown University's National Security Studies Program. Jonathan L.A. Shrier 
is the research director at ACCESS: A Security Information Service. The views 
expressed here are their own.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush, despite bipartisan advice to the contrary, seems ready to redefine 
arms control by emphasizing conventional and chemical negotiations and putting 
nuclear arms talks on the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
The premises of a changing course are beguiling: Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's military reforms remain an uncertain basis for "deep cuts" in 
nuclear arms, conventional force reductions could lessen U.S. nuclear leverage 
and Soviet decline allows the United States to call the arms-control tune. 
There is also the view that Ronald Reagan's arms-reduction legacy is a fluke, 
seen by liberals as product of Reagan's opportunism and Gorbachev's initiatives 
and by conservatives as a sellout, an aberration, ripe for replacement by a 
more cautious approach. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Reagan legacy is consistent with the basic themes of American national 
strategy over the last dozen years: seeking deep cuts in nuclear forces while 
reducing the risks of inadvertent nuclear war and ensuring that arms control is 
not detached from U.S. concerns about regional conflict and human rights. 
Progress made in these areas by Reagan will be jeopardized by Bush 
Administration "bait and switch" tactics that attempt to substitute a chemical 
arms agreement for a strategic nuclear one. 
</P>
<P>
Two realities further mock a postponement of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks 
(START) in favor of progress in the Conventional Forces in Europe talks and 
negotiations for a chemical weapons pact: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before a START agreement, the Bush Administration cannot wisely make the 
urgent budget choices called for on two expensive bomber programs (B-1B and 
B-2) and two costly and uncertain missile programs (rail-mobile MX and 
Midgetman). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Americans and West Europeans are concerned about the nuclear dilemma; 
conventional forces cuts are not likely to come soon enough or be deep enough, 
in the first instance, to ease budget problems or impress voters in North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. 
</P>
<P>
The worthy efforts for a chemical-arms agreement do not respond to concerns of 
publics or security elites. Granted, chemical arms are weapons of mass 
destruction, but not of possible social or national destruction. There are no 
itchy trigger fingers capable of firing all our chemical weapons, should we 
decide the Soviets were thinking about firing theirs. Bush's vow last Oct. 21 
had a hollow ring: "If I'm remembered for anything, it would be this: A 
complete and total ban on chemical weapons. Their destruction for ever. That's 
my solemn mission." 
</P>
<P>
Such a pact would resound politically with the noise of a feather, doing 
nothing to satisfy the deep, if now muted, public desire for cuts in strategic 
nuclear weapons. Finally, Bush cannot deliver on his "solemn mission." Any 
country with a fertilizer plant can make chemical weapons, the poor nation's 
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, the case for ignoring the Reagan agenda needs testing; 
up close, the arguments don't add up. 
</P>
<P>
Change in the Soviet Union. Soviet foreign-policy changes in the late 1980s -- 
withdrawing from Afghanistan, paying U.N. debts, freeing emigration, settling 
regional issues and initiating arms accords -- do not depend on Gorbachev. They 
stem from an elite consensus that previous policies were counterproductive and 
costly. Gorbachev is the agent of change, but the impulse for such reform 
predates his rise. Support from the military and lack of dissent from the 
Politburo indicates the trend will continue even if resistance to domestic 
economic reform ends in Gorbachev's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus is that Moscow needs relief from security burdens and pressures 
to remedy chronic deficiencies of crisis proportions. Military leaders see 
economic stagnation and decline as long-term threats to Soviet security. They 
also entertain the notion that military exertions stimulate responses adding to 
insecurity and are trying to define a strategy of "reasonable sufficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 Western Leverage. "Go slow" advice to gain concessions in the 
conventional-force talks before a START accord on nuclear arms presumes the 
United States has nuclear bargaining leverage to alter a Warsaw Pact numerical 
edge in conventional forces. This neglects evidence of Warsaw Pact 
determination to achieve conventional cuts. With Moscow's support, the Warsaw 
Pact sought new negotiations for asymmetrical European force reductions in the 
first place, a change indicating readiness for concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Further, nuclear-force cuts would not yield opportunities for resource 
transfers in the economically beleaguered Warsaw Pact nations, except the 
Soviet Union, and would not provide Moscow the industrial and manpower 
resources needed for economic reforms. Significant deactivation of conventional 
units drives Warsaw Pact interest in conventional-force reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear and conventional negotiating situations and any agreements that emerge 
must be judged by how they serve Western security -- individually and together. 
This does not mean one must wait upon the other. Rather, the Western 
conventional negotiating posture is influenced by developments in START. More 
linkage than this risks a failure to gain the security advantages of both. 
</P>
<P>
 Vulnerability/Survivability. A major plaint of START critics is that the 
treaty would not reduce and might even increase the vulnerability of U.S. 
land-based ICBMs. But although START was never intended to remedy the 
vulnerability of fixed, land-based ICBMs, it would, nonetheless, be 
complementary. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s the United States compensated for the increasing vulnerability 
of ICBMs in fixed silos by dividing its nuclear forces among bombers, 
submarines and ICBMs, a hedge against increases in vulnerability of any one leg 
of the triad. (The Soviets, in contrast, have emphasized land-based ICBMs.) 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have complained that under START the ratio of Soviet warheads to 
U.S. missiles could rise by over a third (from 2.93:1 to 4.2:1). However, 
because of the rule of thumb that a prudent targeter will assign two warheads 
to every missile silo, this change would be militarily insignificant, since the 
Soviets would be able to double-team each U.S. silo with or without a START 
agreement. On the other hand, the ratio of U.S. MX missile warheads (the most 
accurate U.S. ballistic missile) to Soviet SS-18s would more than double (from 
1.6:1 to 3.25:1), making the SS-18 force actually vulnerable to the MX force. 
</P>
<P>
START would be militarily significant in two other ways. First, it would 
prevent the Soviets from building new strategic weapons targeted against Europe 
to offset the intermediate-range forces being eliminated under the INF Treaty. 
Second, START would make it feasible to reduce U.S. ICBM vulnerability. A 
consensus exists among politicians and policy analysts for START plus ICBM 
modernization, reflecting a view that modernization will be more effective if 
the Soviets are prevented by a START agreement from counterbalancing 
deployments. Those most concerned about ICBM vulnerability should be leading 
supporters of START. 
</P>
<P>
 Verification and Compliance. The Reagan Administration pioneered innovative 
and intrusive verification methods; the Soviet Union broke new ground by 
accepting them. Opponents say these techniques lack proved reliability and 
place Soviet spies in our midst (though this means both denying their previous 
charges that the U.S. was an "open book" for Soviet intelligence and renouncing 
the U.S. quest for intrusive verification). Insistence on perfect verification 
overrates the risks of a militarily significant violation going undetected and 
underrates those of nuclear uncertainty and rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Both START and the conventional talks impose verification challenges more 
demanding than INF, which banned a whole class of weapons rather than limiting 
them. The logical next step is to pursue opportunities for verification 
measures relevant to strategic and conventional forces, capitalizing on the INF 
momentum to establish new standards for force visibility and data exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers have taken a contrary step -- imagining exaggerated scenarios in 
which the Soviets suddenly "break out" of prospective START limits and spring a 
huge arsenal on an unsuspecting United States. They suppose the Soviets could 
cheat on an unprecedented scale without a hint reaching the United States. 
Given that such a revelation would galvanize U.S. opinion and restart the 
missile race (without eliminating the U.S. nuclear retaliatory capability), it 
is more plausible that risks of exposure would deter the Soviets from 
militarily significant cheating. Sensible studies -- ones that include 
assessments of the reasons why or the conditions under which the Soviets might 
attempt to break out of a treaty -- are prudent and would aid in planning 
verification to guard against realistic risks. But nightmare scenarios are 
obstructionist distractions. 
</P>
<P>
Reaping the rewards of Reagan's course in arms cuts and avoiding pitfalls 
requires a farsighted, integrated and comprehensible approach. The zigzag 
quality of much U.S. arms-control policy has made it mysterious to the public 
and open to criticism from left and right. Bush must establish realizable 
objectives and priorities among various initiatives -- strategic, conventional, 
chemical -- and show how they can mesh in U.S. security policy. He should avoid 
nuclear-balance dogmatism, specifically the idea that a reduction in or 
addition to numbers or performance in either superpower arsenal leads easily to 
nuclear blackmail or nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
Arms accords can produce a less volatile strategic environment that enhances 
Western security by: 1) reducing specific threats and contingencies, 2) 
diminishing uncertainty in military and political planning, 3) aiding strategic 
intelligence and 4) permitting more orderly procurement. Unilateral American or 
Soviet force cuts, like those Gorbachev advanced in New York last December, 
cannot contribute to a stable nuclear setting; neither side knows where or when 
such reductions might come or how deep or lasting they may be. 
</P>
<P>
A more stable nuclear balance safeguarded by arms limitation won't yield a 
quick "peace dividend" for domestic programs or tax cuts. That could come 
later, by skillful resource planning. Agreements increase costs for 
verification capability and for hedges to cope with risks in the early years of 
significant reductions. But stable strategic planning does mean forgoing 
expenditure in nuclear-related forces and diverting funds to deficiencies in 
readiness, air-lift and sea-lift. Arms limitation assists both peace and 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental goals of negotiation are to improve Western security through 
nuclear threat-reduction and to keep American security requirements in line 
with available resources. This latter consideration has grown in importance as 
U.S. resources have declined relative to other countries. Effective arms 
agreements also provide incentives for compliance with existing accords and 
negotiating new ones, thus helping to avoid the delay and mistrust of 
stop-and-go negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits of negotiated security are not available without a policy 
specifically designed to gain them, one that is sustainable over time in terms 
of U.S.-Soviet relations and domestic support. Reagan's deep cuts can be 
managed if they are related sensibly to conventional reductions and phased in 
with confidence-building measures to allay anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
A disjointed approach to arms control -- lacking a broad view of opportunities 
in security policy and East-West relations, failing to enunciate a clear 
picture of aims and steps to accomplish them and prizing novelty over 
continuity -- runs a high risk of eventually failing at home, whether or not it 
succeeds at the bargaining table.

ARE JOURNALISTS PERFIDIOUS CON ARTISTS? NATIONAL NAME-CALLING AMONG PARASITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Shaw, David Shaw writes on media issues for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what 
is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is a kind of 
confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance, or loneliness, gaining 
their trust and betraying them without remorse." 
</P>
<P>
So wrote Janet Malcolm in the first paragraph of a two-part, 40,000-word 
exegesis in the New Yorker last month on journalist/author Joe McGinniss, his 
book, "Fatal Vision" and his subsequent legal battle with the subject of that 
book, Jeffrey MacDonald, the ex-Marine who was convicted of murdering his 
pregnant wife and their two small children in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
McGinniss and MacDonald signed an agreement giving McGinniss exclusive rights 
to and absolute artistic control over a book on MacDonald, provided that the 
"essential integrity" of MacDonald's life story was maintained; they also 
signed an agreement giving MacDonald a percentage of the income from the book. 
</P>
<P>
McGinniss spent four years on "Fatal Vision." He became a part of MacDonald's 
defense team and for a time shared living quarters with MacDonald (and others). 
In the course of their collaboration, the two became friends. MacDonald insists 
he is innocent, and he assumed McGinniss' book would exonerate him. When, 
instead, the book depicted him as a psychopathic killer, MacDonald sued 
McGinniss for fraud and breach of contract -- a case that ended in a mistrial, 
followed by a private cash settlement paid to MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm is on MacDonald's side. She says McGinniss -- and all journalists -- 
are guilty of "perfidy . . . seduction and betrayal . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The journalist must do his work in a kind of deliberately induced state of 
moral anarchy," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists have leaped to defend their individual and collective integrity 
against Malcolm's onslaught, but there is a glimmer of truth -- albeit only a 
glimmer -- in what Malcolm is saying. 
</P>
<P>
For a journalist, The Story (or The Book) always comes first. Journalists don't 
generally approach subjects altruistically, and subjects don't usually talk to 
journalists altruistically. Those who submit to the process have their own 
agendas, and they almost invariably assume that they will persuade the 
journalist to see things their way. (Why else would any corporate mogul in his 
right mind agree to face Mike Wallace in front of a television camera?) But if 
the story or the book or the "60 Minutes" episode turns out unfavorably, the 
subject feels betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists often don't disclose their precise intention on a given story. 
Sometimes, journalists don't even know what they're after at first. But if they 
do know -- and if they expect to find something their subjects won't like -- 
they usually won't announce that. Instead, the journalist will probably try to 
make a person feel comfortable and secure, to gain the subject's confidence; 
sources not experienced in dealing with the media may be misled by this. So, in 
that sense, yes, a journalist is something of a con artist, "preying" on the 
subject individual, as Malcolm charges. 
</P>
<P>
But I've been a journalist for 25 years, specializing in writing about other 
journalists for the last 14, and most journalists I know do not deliberately 
lie to their subjects or behave in a "morally indefensible" fashion, as Malcolm 
charges -- and, alas, as two prominent writers testified for McGinniss in the 
trial of MacDonald's suit against him. 
</P>
<P>
William F. Buckley Jr. -- he of the sesquipedalian vocabulary -- suddenly found 
himself unable, under oath, to define one small word ("lie"). But Buckley did 
say that "for the purpose of lubricating the discussion in order to learn more 
information," he would tell his subject something he didn't really believe. 
Even worse, Joseph Wambaugh tried to make a bizarre distinction between an 
indefensible "lie" and a defensible "untruth." A writer's obligation, Wambaugh 
argued, is to his book -- which he characterized as "a baby . . . a living 
thing" -- and he said that in pursuit of the truth, a writer should tell his 
subject an "untruth," if necessary, in order to "nurture" that baby. 
</P>
<P>
What Wambaugh calls an "untruth" is what some of us were taught to think of as 
a "white lie" -- telling your wife she looks nice in her new dress when she 
really doesn't (to use Wambaugh's example). But that's a long way from 
misleading a murder suspect into thinking that you believe he's innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Wambaugh now claims he was referring only to a writer's dealings with 
psychopathic killers and that he would, of course, tell "only the straight, 
honest truth with normal people." But the trial transcript shows he made no 
such distinction when he was under oath, testifying on "customs and practices 
in the literary community." Indeed, I find the Wambaugh/Buckley/McGinniss 
reasoning sadly reminiscent of what another New Yorker writer, Alastair Reid, 
said five years ago when he tried to explain certain fabrications in his 
stories: "There is a truth that is harder to get at . . . than the truth 
yielded by fact." 
</P>
<P>
Buckley, Wambaugh and Reid are the journalistic equivalent of the American 
major in Vietnam who said, "It became necessary to destroy the town in order to 
save it." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm, too, belongs in this group. "Morally indefensible" journalism seems to 
be her forte. In the course of her essay, she neglected to mention her own 
legal battles with a psychologist who sued her (unsuccessfully), charging that 
she fabricated quotations and counterfeited dialogue -- behavior that would 
seem to disqualify her as journalism's ethical arbiter. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the two crucial points in both Malcolm's article and MacDonald's 
lawsuit against McGinniss were: 1) When did McGinniss decide MacDonald was 
guilty? and 2) Did McGinniss deceive MacDonald into thinking the book would 
exonerate him? 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm is intellectually perfidious on both points. 
</P>
<P>
She quotes Jeffrey M. Elliot, who is also writing a book on MacDonald, as 
saying that McGinniss wrote letters "assuring MacDonald -- right up to 
publication -- that the book would exonerate him." But neither she nor 
MacDonald has offered any evidence that McGinniss offered such "assurances." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm quotes McGinniss as having decided during MacDonald's 1979 murder trial 
that he was guilty; then, she writes, "for almost four years -- during which he 
corresponded with MacDonald, spoke with him on the telephone . . . and, on two 
occasions visited him, he successfully hid the fact that in the book under 
preparation he was portraying MacDonald as a psychopathic killer." 
</P>
<P>
But McGinniss said he liked MacDonald "enormously" and had great difficulty 
reconciling his fondness for him with his growing realization that he had 
committed a monstrous crime. "For a long time," he said, "I was unable to 
persuade myself intellectually that he didn't do it but unable to persuade 
myself emotionally that he did." 
</P>
<P>
More than 18 months before he finished writing "Fatal Vision," McGinniss gave 
MacDonald's attorney at least a strong hint that he might not be writing a book 
sympathetic to MacDonald: "Look," he said, "I have a moral obligation to the 
truth. I don't have a moral obligation to MacDonald." But Malcolm doesn't 
mention this exchange. Nor does she bother to quote an explanation McGinniss 
gave on the same page of a legal document that she does quote in another 
context. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that I knew it (MacDonald's guilt) with certainty, in my heart as 
well as my head, only when I finished writing the book," McGinniss said. 
</P>
<P>
I know what McGinniss means. As Flannery O'Connor has said, "I write because I 
don't know what I think until I read what I write." 
</P>
<P>
To McGinniss, writing is "an act of discovery," so while he concedes that ". . 
. on the basis of the evidence presented, had I been a juror, I quite likely 
would have voted to convict," he says that realization was "only the beginning, 
not the end of my quest . . . . I had to go deeper, I had to know more, I had 
to try to understand." 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to suggest that I think McGinniss behaved honorably in his 
dealings with MacDonald. He didn't (although he would argue that since 
MacDonald lied in proclaiming his innocence, McGinniss had no obligation to be 
honorable). 
</P>
<P>
McGinniss may not have known in his heart that MacDonald was guilty until he 
finished writing his book, but he clearly had damn strong feelings about 
MacDonald's guilt long before he typed the final words. And yet, while he 
didn't "assure" MacDonald that the book would exonerate him, he certainly did 
virtually everything short of an outright lie to give MacDonald that 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
In his letters to MacDonald, McGinniss expressed sympathy and friendship and 
outrage over his conviction ("Total strangers can recognize within five minutes 
that you did not receive a fair trial"; "How could 12 people . . . agree to 
believe such a horrendous proposition?"). McGinniss also beseeched MacDonald 
not to cooperate with other authors seeking to write a book, implying that they 
might not be sympathetic ("At this time to the best of anyone's knowledge, 
there are no unfriendly MacDonald books on the horizon"). 
</P>
<P>
McGinniss' lawyer argued in court that his client's letters expressing "warmth 
and understanding" changed within a few months after MacDonald's conviction, as 
McGinniss began to vacillate in his feelings; after that, the letters became a 
"much more formal kind of correspondence." 
</P>
<P>
But even in his "formal" letters, McGinniss continued to share with MacDonald 
news of editing problems and book publication and promotion plans in an 
enthusiastic, we're-in-this together spirit that MacDonald -- obsessed with 
proving his innocence, convinced of McGinniss' friendship and support -- could 
only have interpreted as evidence that the book would be favorable to him. 
</P>
<P>
McGinniss virtually conceded as much when he testified in court that there came 
a point in their relationship when " . . . I was willing to let him continue to 
believe whatever he wanted to believe, so he wouldn't try to prevent me from 
finishing my book . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But McGinniss did more than simply "let" MacDonald believe what he wanted to 
believe. He actively, disingenuously, encouraged that belief. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1982 -- almost three years after MacDonald's conviction, when 
McGinniss had written "75% of the book" -- he even provided MacDonald with an 
advance peek at a brief passage from the book. That passage described the judge 
at MacDonald's murder trial as having acted in a way that might have prejudiced 
the jury against him. Why would McGinniss -- who adamantly refused to allow 
MacDonald to see the book before publication -- send him that one excerpt, if 
not to create the impression that the book itself was favorable to MacDonald? 
</P>
<P>
Having invested so much time, McGinniss was clearly terrified that if MacDonald 
realized the book might not exonerate him, he would stop cooperating, thus 
jeopardizing both the book and the money McGinniss would make from it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was making a conscious effort to keep lines of communication open" at a time 
when MacDonald was "pressing harder and harder to see the entire book," 
McGinniss conceded when I asked about this. That one passage, McGinniss knew, 
would "calm him down a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after sending the passage about the judge, McGinniss wrote another 
letter to MacDonald, urging "by all means, hype the book" -- a suggestion that 
any reasonable person would also interpret as evidence the book was favorable 
to him. Would someone who insisted on his own innocence knowingly "hype" a book 
that depicted him as a brutal murderer? 
</P>
<P>
So McGinniss did prey on MacDonald's "vanity, ignorance (and) . . . loneliness" 
to maintain his "trust," in Malcolm's words. And Malcolm does seem to have done 
her own work in the very sort of "deliberately induced state of moral anarchy" 
for which she condemns all journalists. But what McGinniss and Malcolm did was 
as atypical as it was wrong. A journalist is something of a parasite, dependent 
on sources, but most are not predators, liars or perfidious con artists.

GINGRICH: DON'T EXPECT 'KINDER, GENTLER' POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard E. Cohen, Richard E. Cohen covers Congress for the National Journal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time for a good word about partisanship. True, tough political sparring 
does not jibe with the trendy "kinder, gentler" Washington. In this world, 
where divided party control of government forces accommodation to get nearly 
anything done, smart politics have been considered "no politics." 
</P>
<P>
But things may have changed with the recent choice by House Republicans of Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.) as their new minority whip. He rose to power drawing 
ideological lines and charging Democrats with ethical misdeeds. His slashing 
political style has made him an object of vitriol, ridicule and fear -- which 
helps explain the unusual interest in the new occupant of the once-obscure 
House leadership post. His selection prompted a Democratic leader to predict 
"an escalation in partisan political warfare at the expense of the national 
interest." A Washington Post profile of the Georgia lawmaker was headlined "The 
Great Divider." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the skeptics' views, Gingrich's election to the No. 2 post in the 
House Republican leadership poses challenges to both parties. Gingrich says 
that his aggressive political style can aid Republicans and the Bush 
Administration by helping them develop more appealing and better-defined 
policies (which have been in short supply since January); the conflict 
resulting from sharpened partisan lines, in turn, can help promote truly 
bipartisan and more effective solutions to national problems. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the recent Democratic initiative to raise the minimum hourly 
wage from $3.35 to $4.55. Many critics, including liberal economists, contend 
that the minimum wage has become increasingly irrelevant in many parts of the 
nation as middle-class teen-agers who flip hamburgers are being offered twice 
the current minimum. They argue that a more effective way to help low-income 
wage earners would be to expand the federal earned-income tax credit, which 
puts more money into the pockets of poor families without the inflationary 
risks of a minimum-wage increase. 
</P>
<P>
In his handling of the issue, Bush has not sought to draw political lines, as 
Gingrich advocates. Instead, he has gone roughly two-thirds of the way toward 
the Democrats' goal. The Democrats, in turn, say that is not enough, raising 
the prospect that Bush will veto the politically popular measure. Would it not 
have made more sense, some Republicans ask, for Bush to press for the 
earned-income tax credit and force Democrats to choose between the interests of 
the poor and those of organized labor? 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has argued that the Republicans should do a better job in defining how 
they differ from the Democrats on a range of issues, including education, 
environment and child-care. For the most part, his proposals envision a 
government-sanctioned choice of expanded opportunities in the private sector. 
He has often pushed for more use of federal tax credits as an incentive. 
</P>
<P>
In lengthy interviews with me, he has contrasted his approach to the Democrats' 
preference for bigger government. Gingrich has called the opposite party an 
unwieldy coalition of the "loony left," big labor and big city machines. The 
result, as exemplified by the 1988 candidacy of Michael S. Dukakis, is out of 
touch with mainstream America, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
His frequent description of the Democratic coalition as "corrupt" has allowed 
Gingrich to link ideology to his long-advocated interest in ethics. A 
continuing and often-overlooked preoccupation of his political career has been 
the need to restore public confidence in government. In fact, he began his 
career as one of the few Republican "Watergate babies." 
</P>
<P>
His first run for the House was in 1974 against Democrat John Flynt, a crusty 
conservative who was chairman of the House Ethics Committee. The previously 
unknown Gingrich won 49% in a disastrous year for Republicans, largely by 
running against Flynt's weak handling of ethics problems. In an early sign of 
his persistence, Gingrich won 48% in a second run against Flynt in 1976, when 
Flynt was helped by having Jimmy Carter as Democratic nominee. Finally, in 
1978, after Flynt announced his retirement, Gingrich was elected to the seat 
serving south and west Atlanta suburbs. Since then, he has easily turned back 
several active opponents with national Democratic backing. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich quickly became a gnat in the nest of House Democrats. Then-Speaker 
Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) was thrown by Gingrich's use of House C-SPAN 
telecasts as a form of guerrilla theater to spotlight perceived Democratic 
outrages. His efforts did little to increase GOP strength but Gingrich began to 
sensitize many Republicans to the frustrations and inequities of their record 
back to 1955 as the House minority party. 
</P>
<P>
His two-vote win (87-85) last month over Edward R. Madigan of Illinois as 
minority whip was based partly on Madigan's ability to do business with 
Democrats. Gingrich calls the less-partisan style "getting the crumbs"; other 
members defend the old approach as helping them serve favored interests in home 
districts and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich won national notice last year when he began hammering House Speaker 
Jim Wright (D-Texas) for ethical lapses, chiefly in personal finances. 
Initially, the crusade was regarded as little more than a collection of dated 
rumors and newspaper stories and Gingrich was widely dismissed. Even many 
Republicans told Gingrich he was wasting his time. Minority Leader Robert H. 
Michel (R-Ill.) asked two other House Republicans to examine Gingrich's case 
against Wright. After an extensive review, they advised Gingrich to drop the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
But Gingrich's persistence eventually led to a formal complaint, plus a 
separate, crucial filing by Common Cause. They prompted the unprecedented 
inquiry by the ethics committee, whose report on Wright is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the same Democrats who a few months ago dismissed Gingrich's complaints 
lately have been waiting uneasily for what many expect to be a tough report 
that will raise serious questions about Wright's tenure as Speaker. "Members 
are dreading what will happen," said a House Democratic source. "No one has any 
stomach for it but they may not be able to avoid it. Especially for those who 
were elected because of Watergate, it's their worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Wright report becomes a dream come true for Gingrich and the 
Republicans remains to be seen. The GOP was reminded last week of the long, 
uphill road it faces to a Republican majority in the House when it lost a 
special election for a vacant seat in a conservative Indiana district once 
represented by Vice President Dan Quayle. From Gingrich's perspective, the 
largely issue-less campaign run by the Republican contender is further evidence 
that Republicans need to draw an ideological line. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana setback led some House Republicans to suggest that, because of his 
limited experience on the House floor, it would have made more sense for 
Gingrich to have taken charge of their campaign committee rather than the more 
legislative-oriented whip post. But in the House's increasingly partisan mood 
-- sparked by the Wright inquiry and the Gingrich leadership election -- the 
would-be centrists may be missing the point: The gloves are off and media-savvy 
warriors like Gingrich are calling the shots.

RECKLESS SKIING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is one important issue that was not addressed in "Reckless Skiing Is 
Pursued as a Felony" (Part I, March 23). Being a four-year resident of Mammoth 
Lakes and a four-year resident of Wrightwood (Mt. High) I have seen a lot of 
smoking (marijuana), drinking of alcohol, and on occasion have seen cocaine 
used on chair lifts and gondolas. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing skiers may be a good idea, but skiing under the influence could well 
be the main culprit of skiing accidents and should, therefore, be addressed in 
the studies and discussions regarding skier safety on the slopes.

OIL SPILL OFF ALASKA SHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although it is not yet clear how extensively the Valdez oil spill will damage 
the Alaskan coast, the incident serves as a lesson in risk assessment. Certain 
occurrences simply must not be allowed to happen. Therefore, activities that 
could lead to their occurrence, even with very small probability, must not be 
sanctioned. Sometime, somehow, the machines will break down or the humans will 
falter and the dreaded event will take place. 
</P>
<P>
Is all the oil in Alaska worth the destruction of Alaska? Is all the nuclear 
power generated today or in the future worth the destruction that could result 
from an accident or accumulation of radioactive waste? If the answer is no, 
then alternatives, even though they may seem like drastic breaks with our past 
way of thinking, must be developed and instituted.

OIL SPILL OFF ALASKA SHORE

Who will hold Exxon accountable for the worst tanker spill in the history of 
our country? Who will be asking the questions to find out why this catastrophe 
happened? In your report on the grounding you noted that there were 20 people 
(crew members) aboard the ship (Part I, March 25). This is fully 20% fewer 
people than on comparable U.S. vessels. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year Exxon has taken deliberate and extreme steps to reduce the 
size of the crews on its tankers and placed the burden for the safe operation 
of its ships on fewer and fewer people. Is anyone asking Exxon the wisdom of 
its decision to reduce crew size, saving one or two hundred thousand dollars a 
year on a multimillion-dollar operation, if one of the consequences is to 
increase the probability of the kind of catastrophe we are now witnessing?

BUSH SHEDS SOME BAGGAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush is gradually shedding some ideological baggage that would have 
weighed him down in any attempt to help American schools improve. President 
Reagan wanted to give parents vouchers to help pay for public, private or 
parochial school educations, and President Bush pledged during his campaign to 
give such tax credits. Now he wisely says the government can't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
The government can't afford them financially, or philosophically. Financially, 
because the federal budget is already tight and should not be subsidizing 
private school education. And philosophically, because public education is the 
cornerstone of opportunity in this land. It must have the fullest federal 
support. Giving tuition tax credits would have hedged that support. 
</P>
<P>
Bush revealed his change of heart last week while talking to high school 
students visiting the White House. He said he had been intrigued with the idea 
of tuition tax credits but decided that federal budget problems make it 
unworkable. So in addition to a tour, these students learned that even 
Presidents can admit when they've had a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
There is still a federal role in education, of course. It's partly financial: 
The government should increase the funds available for the successful Head 
Start preschool programs, for other education aid in impoverished neighborhoods 
and for innovative pilot programs. And it's partly philosophical: The President 
of the United States should be the nation's biggest booster of public 
education. Bush has lightened his load and can move more freely toward that 
goal now.

RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real problem with teaching is not money but respect. Kids, their parents, 
and school administrators often treat teachers without the common courtesy and 
respect that they would give their doctor or other professional person, like an 
airline pilot or banker. 
</P>
<P>
Students lie to their teachers, cut class, and whine about their homework and 
grades. Parents bully teachers into doing things against their better judgment. 
School administrators criticize teachers in private and in staff meetings, and 
call endless "conferences" to discuss what could be more efficiently handled by 
memos. 
</P>
<P>
As a Los Angeles junior high and high school teacher (first in public, now in 
private schools), I've been forced to change grades against my will, make 
degrading apologies, and listen to endless abuse from people who think they 
know more about my job than I do. 
</P>
<P>
I feel that 20 years of teaching, with the vast majority of my former students 
having good memories of the time spent with me, are my best references for my 
qualifications as a professional instructor. You don't call your dentist a 
fool, you trust his judgment. I am rarely asked for my honest opinion about 
anything important regarding my job. I have never been asked by an 
administrator what I don't like about the school's treatment of me. 
</P>
<P>
I don't work for money, have never participated in a strike, and I spend hours 
after school every day helping kids for no extra pay. I still love teaching and 
do it for the kids, not for their parents or my bosses. And if I ever got a 
little respect once in a while, I might remain a teacher for the rest of my 
life!

ERMA BOMBECK: ANOTHER BIG SPENDER LEAVES THE FOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your son opens the envelope and his first credit card falls out. Is it his 
first taste of maturity? Or his last meal before execution? 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, small moments from the past invade the present like a pesky gnat that 
won't go away. You remember the first time he emptied out his piggy bank and 
tried to buy a $30 wagon with $1.57. But he was a naive child then. Not to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
Later, for no reason, you recall when he bought a $60 sweater for a girl he met 
in a line to see "Kiss of the Spider Woman," whom he dated for two weeks. If he 
didn't eat lunch or put gas in the car for three months, he could afford it. 
But he was only an impulsive teen-ager then. Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Then you remember how he borrowed $40 for a concert ticket from you in 1984 and 
still hasn't paid you back. It's time to worry! 
</P>
<P>
It's all your fault. You piffled away all those years telling him not to talk 
with food in his mouth and never to sit on a public toilet seat, but you didn't 
teach him about money. He thinks all you have to do is insert a bank card in a 
slot in a brick building and it drools 10s and 20s into a little tray. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, he'll be all right. He's older now. Once he sits down and reads all the 
small print about interest rates, and checks the charges against the slips he's 
going to file in his desk each month, and keeps tabs on how much he's spending 
by keeping a little notebook in his billfold, he'll . . . end up in jail. 
That's what he's going to do. 
</P>
<P>
Remember his first checkbook? He thought it was a scratch pad for phone 
messages and shopping lists. When he wasn't ripping out one to wrap his gum in, 
he was scribbling out a check for something minor. He once was clocked at 
writing 23 checks in one week under $2. 
</P>
<P>
What are you worried about? The credit card will be different. He has only one 
little piece of plastic to keep track of. . . . Wait a minute. What if he gets 
more than one credit card!? No one has just one credit card. His name and 
address are already in a worldwide computer system to alert everyone on this 
planet that another "big spender" is in tow. 
</P>
<P>
A picture begins to form. He'll charge, charge, charge until all he is paying 
is interest. He'll get a second job to keep up with his time payments. He won't 
be able to afford his car. Without a car, he won't get dates. Without a date, 
he won't get married. Without marriage, you'll never be a grandmother. Why is 
he ruining your life!? 
</P>
<P>
As he prepares to leave the house, sanity returns. There is no reason in the 
world why he can't change into a responsible human being who is committed to 
being accountable for his own actions. Maybe he isn't the flake you thought he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
As the motor of his car turns over, you see the credit card on top of the 
toaster. Should you keep the card and sleep at night? Or should you run out and 
give it to him? 
</P>
<P>
What do you mean, give you a minute to think!?

SHORT TAKES: HONOREE'S HEART REMAINS IN WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Honors she has, in abundance, but a little funding would be nice too. 
</P>
<P>
On April 29, the Coro Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan educational 
foundation, will fete Dr. Grace Payne ("proudly" of Watts) for "distinguished 
contributions to the community." The latest laurel is not entirely unexpected. 
Payne has been similarly cited by everyone from Pepperdine University (honorary 
doctorate of laws) to the State Assembly ("Woman of the Year"). 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think I was the only person in South-Central L.A. doing anything," she 
says with a sigh, but if it calls attention to her prime project, Payne will 
endure. For 17 years, she has been executive director of the Westminster 
Neighborhood Assn., a Watts center that provides a spectrum of social services 
for senior citizens to children with behavioral problems; three day-care 
centers; a restaurant to train youth for food-preparation jobs; a new 
$1-million gym. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In her spare time, Payne, 72, is one of five commissioners of the Port of Los 
Angeles, administering a relatively little-known facility that does no less 
than $65-billion worth of business annually. But her heart remains in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I could live about anywhere," she says, "but I feel that I'm needed 
here. These people have as much right to quality service as anybody anywhere in 
the city. I can help see that they get it. And not only do they benefit from my 
skills, I benefit from theirs; I learn a lot from them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to find a way (to ensure) that when I'm gone, they won't have to 
struggle to raise funds," Payne muses aloud. "We need an endowment, and I need 
to have somebody show me how to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard, though. It's fantastic what the center does, but when people talk 
about Watts they only talk about the crime. I keep trying to explain to them 
that Watts is the name of a community, not a riot!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Griffith Park's Little Nugget a Real Gem 
</P>
<P>
Anachronistically tucked under the sleek skin of the streamlined City of Los 
Angeles, the luxurious railroad lounge car called the Little Nugget was 
patterned after an Old West saloon. 
</P>
<P>
Created and decorated by artist Walt Kuhn, the Nugget was considered the most 
lavish car on the rails -- this in the pre-Amtrak era when railroads vied not 
only for passengers but for distinction. 
</P>
<P>
From its custom-woven floral Brussels carpet to clusters of cupids cavorting on 
the ceiling, the lounge was unique. Even the bar sported its own brass 
gaslights, carved roses and a warbling mechanical "bird in a gilded cage." 
</P>
<P>
Delivered in 1937, the Nugget was retired in 1956. Rather than consign the car 
to the scrap heap, the Union Pacific Railroad gave it to the city, where it 
fetched up -- and was subsequently plundered -- in Griffith Park's Travel Town. 
"We're not sure how it happened," says Greg Gneier, a TV art director who 
moonlights as project director of the volunteer Little Nugget Restoration Team. 
"Visitors were allowed to walk through the car, with attendant wear and tear." 
In time, the car's ornate chairs, tables and wall pictures began to vanish. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not accusing anybody," Gneier hastens to add. "Let's not say thieves. We 
prefer rescuers. We would like the furnishings back, though, no questions 
asked, maybe even a little reward. Actually, we started with one chair. We made 
some phone calls. Now we have three chairs, a table and one of the missing 
paintings -- which, for all we know, may have been taken down in the '70s when 
the city painted the walls, stored somewhere and forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to display the restored Nugget in the new Travel Town museum, 
whenever it is built. "It's not just a railroad car," says Gneier, an unabashed 
"romantic." "It's a work of art. It represents an entire life-style long gone. 
It's part of our heritage." DICK RORABACK

ZAN THOMPSON: BUDDY ROGERS: SOMEONE TO COUNT ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wednesday evening, when all the pretty people were at the Shrine Auditorium 
paying homage to Oscar, the motion picture industry totem, another group of 
people was at a party at the place where it all began. It was in the Blossom 
Room of the Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard that the first Academy 
Awards ceremony was held in 1928. The movie named best picture that long-ago 
year was "Wings," and one of its stars was Charles (Buddy) Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was back in the Blossom Room on Wednesday night as the guest of honor of 
the Visiting Nurse Assn. of Los Angeles at the organization's 50th birthday 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
The VNA of Los Angeles, Pasadena and the San Fernando Valley is one of those 
solid organizations I don't think much about. It's like the American Heart 
Assn. or 50 other organizations I take for granted. Most of us do. You know 
they're out there doing great, worthwhile things and isn't that wonderful? But 
unless the corners start to crumble off your life and you need them, groups 
like the VNA aren't at the top of your mind every day. 
</P>
<P>
But it has been there for us since 1939 when some Los Angeles volunteers and 
some health professionals decided that there was a need for home care without 
any thought of the person's ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, staff members made 200,000 visits to 20,000 people. They manage all 
this with the help of Medicare, Medi-Cal and private insurance companies. They 
also depend on private fund-raising where they entice Los Angeles citizens to 
put a little something on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
That's what the Oscar night ball was, a fund-raiser so that the VNA could 
continue to bring people nursing, therapy, social services (they help with 
Social Security forms, for instance) hospice care, intravenous therapy and 
maternal and newborn care so that people can be at home where they get well 
quicker. Visiting nurses also consult with patients on diets and medicine and 
provide medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The money raised last week is ticketed for a new program called I COUNT TOO. 
It's for adolescents who are watching a parent die from a disastrous illness. 
At a time like that, all of the attention and energy of family and friends are 
focused on the ill person, and the kid may be told to do his homework, visit a 
friend, play with the dog, mow the lawn, anything but get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
In I COUNT TOO, nurses and social workers meet with the young people and they 
talk about their problems, mainly the biggest, "How come me?" 
</P>
<P>
The kids support each other so no one ever feels he is going through this dark 
woods all alone. Finally and always, they do do it alone, but the support 
offered to them, open-handedly, no strings, is of inestimable worth. 
</P>
<P>
They find that the sadness, insecurity and worry are shared with other young 
people. The program takes them through the last awful days, the funeral, the 
mourning and the fact that their lives are torn up like bits of paper. It is a 
great help to kids in a black time. 
</P>
<P>
My mother died of cancer when I was 18, and when the ambulance came to pick her 
up to take her to the hospital for what we all knew would be her last surgery, 
Daddy, a lawyer, was in a trial, and I was alone. When the ambulance drove away 
from the house, I fell to the living room floor with my face in the carpet and 
cried. Our schnauzer, a wise dog, came over and licked my tears and I knew I 
had to stop because I was worrying my best friend. I remember well saying to 
Monks, "Well, this isn't getting anything done and won't change anything and 
self-pity is tacky. Let's go peel the potatoes." And we did. 
</P>
<P>
Mama had always said that we don't weep for the dead. We weep for ourselves and 
the terrible hollowness inside us. Besides, I had to take care of Daddy and get 
dinner ready and go to the theater and do my show. 
</P>
<P>
When Mama died, I remember following the casket down the center aisle of St. 
Victor's with Daddy and seeing my friends out of the corner of my eye. I felt 
as if I were odd, strange, out of step. My mother had died, which made me 
different. 
</P>
<P>
But I was 18 and I still had Daddy and Monks. A lot of younger kids are losing 
the only parent they have and have no idea where they will even live and take 
their stuff. Can they keep their dog, wherever they have to go? 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the tearing problems helped by the adults who run I COUNT 
TOO. And this is just one of the programs financed by the VNA and its friends. 
</P>
<P>
I know all the VNA guests had a wonderful time at their Oscar night ball, and 
some kids will have a little gentler time because a wise and trained grown-up 
says just the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
It's a wonderful project. I would like to tell the youngsters facing this that 
nothing that happens is their fault and that although it won't go away, it will 
get better.

ON VIEW: ZOO GALA TO PREVIEW ADVENTURE ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Tellefsen, chairman of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., and his band of 
trustees brought in $500,000 this week toward their goal to raise $8.3 million 
for Adventure Island, the Los Angeles Zoo's soon-to-debut attraction. That 
leaves $1 million before the public grand opening May 5. 
</P>
<P>
With confidence, GLAZA is putting invitations into the mail to about 1,000 for 
the Preview Gala for both children and adults April 30. Betty White Ludden, Jim 
and Gloria Stewart and Mayor Tom Bradley are among those receiving them, along 
with corporate leaders and their kids and grandkids. Adventure Island, totally 
funded by individual and corporate/foundation donors, will showcase the wonders 
of Southwest animals. 
</P>
<P>
For the party, Someone's in the Kitchen Catering will pour out genuine Western 
cuisine and the Reinsmen will blast the rustic songs. Zoorific Theater will be 
there to tell tall tales about sea lions, sidewinders, scorpions, prairie dogs, 
cougars (the mascots of Adventure Island). The kids there on the first night 
will get the inaugural opportunities to use the interactive teaching devices as 
well as see the animal nursery and the theater for daily animal shows. 
</P>
<P>
YOU'RE THE STARS: Oscars, Emmys, Tonys and Grammys aside, United Way calls 
givers their stars, and George F. Moody, general campaign chairman, and the 
United Way Campaign Cabinet say "You Are the Stars" when they host what is 
anticipated to be a victory celebration April 13 at the University Sheraton. 
Clarence Brown, director of media affairs, notes, "We expect to reach our 
$89-million goal this year, so we expect a big turnout -- 1,000." 
</P>
<P>
It's expected to be the largest amount ever raised by United Way. 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATE: Doheny Mansion in Chester Place will be the place April 14 for a 
gala "Celebrate" for Sister Magdalen Coughlin, retiring president of Mount St. 
Mary's College. Caroline W. Nahas and David L. McIntyre co-chair the black-tie 
affair. It's intended to salute Sister Magdalen's community contributions. 
She'll continue her task of fund raising for the college, but relinquish the 
day-by-day running of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
EASTER MONDAY: Easter Monday came and went without the traditional Presentation 
Ball presented by Social Service Auxiliary. That's because the prominent 
affair, long held on Easter Monday, moves to June 5 this year when 31 young 
women from communities throughout Southern California will be presented to 
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony at the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I'm writing to express my dismay at the change in format and articles written 
in the View section. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, there seems a concerted effort to publish pieces geared 
to the sensational and bordering on tabloid journalism. Previously you had 
portraits of achievers who were trying to make a difference -- issue-oriented 
individuals whose selfless lives we admired and whose courage we wanted to 
emulate. Issues of hunger, nuclear war, peace and justice were prominently 
displayed. What happened to the terrific pieces by Kathleen Hendrix and Beverly 
Beyette? 
</P>
<P>
Now there seem to be an excess of the rich and famous -- individuals whose 
contributions are dubious. Who wants to read about Donald Trump or David Duke 
in the wonderful Los Angeles Times? There are plenty of magazines that cater to 
this type of rubbish. Please bring back the old View section.

PRECIOUS PLANET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice Kahn should be branded with a scarlet letter "A" for apathetic. In her 
article "Hellbent for Destruction . . . but Have a Nice Day" (March 22), she 
disgusted me with her laissez-faire attitude about environmental concerns. Our 
planet is a wreck, but it is a sorry fact that the majority of people will not 
take action until our environment is practically unbearable, and at the rate we 
are going, that shouldn't take too many more years. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up the evasive point to her article, Kahn finally admits that the 
environmentalists are right, that we need to take action, but she has no clue 
as to what she can do. As concerned inhabitants of this planet, there is plenty 
we can do. For starters, support the environmentalist groups that work for 
hardly any pay at all to keep the planet healthy. 
</P>
<P>
There is Greenpeace, Sane/Freeze, Peta, Save the Bay, and the list goes on. 
Keep informed on current events. Attend lectures, demonstrations, marches and 
rallies. Read. Don't use household products that contain dangerous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
There are natural alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Write letters to politicians. Let your voice be heard. Give your attention to 
at least one cause that moves you and you can make a difference. There is no 
time left to just sit there and let others take care of the environment; after 
all, it belongs to all of us. It's everyone's problem.

WHAT WE EAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for Jack Smith's compassionate and self-revealing column, 
"Reflections of Our Animal Appetites." This revelation of consciousness is 
particularly timely in light of the fact that we have discovered that eating 
animal flesh is almost as harmful to the eaters as it is to the eaten 
(although, probably less painful). Since the '50s, because we were wealthy 
enough to pay for it, we Americans have been on an animal food binge and it's 
costing us our lives and our environment. 
</P>
<P>
Old habits die hard. It won't be easy for most of us to give up or cut down on 
animal products, but even the professed carnivore will have to agree that it is 
the only intelligent thing to do.

The article "Living Downtown" (by Myrna Oliver, March 22) really caught my

classify them as "undesirables" for the upper-middle and upper classes to 
interact with. I'm offended, and I believe an apology to the many Latinos whom 
you have offended is in order.

WALKING TOURS WITH ENGLISH WRITERS

DORCHESTER, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to Browning, this is the poetic time of year along the back 
roads of southwest England, when walking trails begin to flower with spring 
blossoms all the way from Dorset, the Cotswolds and the moors of Dartmoor to 
the Scottish countryside. 
</P>
<P>
To travel through the Dorset countryside, my wife, Elfriede, and I brought one 
backpack from home, which is all we needed for overnighting in village inns 
before returning to our base in this historic country town of about 13,000. 
</P>
<P>
Driving through the southwest of England by rental car from London, we used 
Dorchester two times as a base for backpack hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Every hike around the Dorset region is an adventure of the mind, confirming the 
words spoken by Hippocrates 2,400 years ago: "Walking is man's best medicine." 
</P>
<P>
This has been called Thomas Hardy country. It's part of his novels and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Over Hill and Dale 
</P>
<P>
Side roads, cow paths and walking trails, and names of villages, hills and 
rivers make their own poetry and folk tales: Melbury Osmond and Minterne Magna, 
Piddle River, Puddletown and Plush. 
</P>
<P>
Cows and sheep graze along the way. Ruins of Iron Age forts emerge from rolling 
downs. We walked to the top of Batcombe Hill, then descended to soft green 
pastures. 
</P>
<P>
The 180-foot Cerne Giant dared us to climb his chalk hillside, which we did. He 
presides over the inns, pubs and old houses of Cerne Abbas, and probably was 
carved into the hillside in Roman times. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking the countryside and walking the villages offers what other great writers 
have said about Dorset. 
</P>
<P>
T. E. Lawrence wrote "The Seven Pillars of Wisdom" at his Clouds Hill cottage. 
He's buried at Moreton village, half a dozen miles east of Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Austen brought the village of Lyme Regis into her novel "Persuasion," as 
did John Fowles in his "French Lieutenant's Woman." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Hardy who immortalized the countryside. He spent much of his long 
and creative life here, from 1840 to 1928. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Novel Setting 
</P>
<P>
It's only a three-mile walk from Dorchester to the village of Higher 
Bockhampton, where the cottage of Hardy's birth and boyhood is a National Trust 
property. The cottage gardens are open from March to October, and you can phone 
for an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking on across the brooding stillness of Edgon Heath, we could feel why Hardy 
made it a setting for "The Return of the Native," and why his life in Dorset 
could inspire "Far from the Madding Crowd." The financial success of the latter 
novel enabled him to build his Max Gate home just outside Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
The walk from Max Gate into Dorchester is a return to the cobbled streets Hardy 
walked for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has his original manuscript of "The Mayor of Casterbridge," the name 
Hardy gave to Dorchester in his novel. To the Romans it was Durnovaria. 
</P>
<P>
The town's Thomas Hardy Society has prepared walking guides to the streets and 
country lanes around it. 
</P>
<P>
King's Arms coaching inn at the old town center of Dorchester is a gracious 
place to shed a backpack. Hardy used it for scenes in his Casterbridge novel. 
</P>
<P>
The inn has 31 bedrooms with private baths; one has a four-poster. The dining 
room, two bars. 
</P>
<P>
A room for two is about $110 U.S. Call for reservations. Along the Dorset 
hiking trails, village inns such as Summer Lodge in Evershot and Plumber Manor 
at Sturminster Newton have double accommodations at about $50 U.S. Farmhouse 
lodging can cost half that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scheduled Treks 
</P>
<P>
The three Englishmen who founded The Wayfarers walking tours open their sixth 
season of countryside adventures on April 16. The 28 scheduled treks will 
conclude Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Other walking tours in England are being offered by such organizations as 
Toronto-based Butterfield &amp; Robinson, and Dales Centre Ltd. through the 
Yorkshire Dales, sponsored by Lord Willie Peel and his associate, Terry Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day, six-night Wayfarers walking adventures average about 10 miles 
daily for a group of about a dozen hikers. A walk leader charts the course and 
introduces historic sights. Luggage is transported to picnics or pub lunches 
and to overnights with dinner at country inns. 
</P>
<P>
The hiking routes cover Hardy's Dorset, Wordsworth's Lake District, Sir Walter 
Scott's Borders, James Herriot's Yorkshire, Devon Coast and Dartmoor, a 
Cotswold Way, Cornwall Creeks and Coves, Wales Border Castles. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy's Dorset hiking tour begins in Sherborne, the town of an old abbey and 
Sir Walter Raleigh's two castles. 
</P>
<P>
It continues to Cerne Abbas and its cliffside giant, Hardy's "Tess of the 
D'Urbervilles" countryside and a 13th-Century manor house, Hardy's Cottage and 
his grave at Stinsford Church. Afterward a farewell dinner in Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of each hiking tour is 595 (about $1,065 U.S.), including breakfast, 
lunch and dinner daily, transportation of baggage, tips and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States contact The Wayfarers, 166 Thames St., Newport, R.I. 
02840, (401) 849-5087. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield and Robinson's nine-day, eight-night Cotswold Way walk is $2,295.

STAY HEALTHY ON PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER, Adler is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While waiting for your plane to take off, suppose you notice that red blotches 
stand out on the face of the person sitting next to you or some other visible 
sign of a condition that you think might be contagious? Or the passenger looks 
ill or disoriented? 
</P>
<P>
What can you or the flight attendants do? 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a passenger sitting next to a child on a flight about to leave 
Frankfurt, West Germany, for the United States complained to a flight attendant 
that the boy had rashes on his arms. 
</P>
<P>
The attendant asked the boy's parents, who said the rashes came from mosquito 
bites. Subsequently, the attendant determined that the parents didn't have a 
doctor's note indicating the child could fly with his "condition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilot Makes Decision 
</P>
<P>
Rather than risk the plane and all of its passengers being possibly quarantined 
in New York City, the attendant consulted with the captain and gate agent, and 
the decision was made to ask the parents and child to get off the plane and 
obtain a doctor's note. After seeing a doctor at the Frankfurt airport, the 
family was able to catch a later flight. 
</P>
<P>
"Each situation involving the condition of a passenger can be different," an 
airline spokeswoman said. "The captain and gate agent are informed. The 
passenger is questioned, with a determination then made on whether the 
passenger is fit to fly and whether there is any danger to other passengers and 
flight personnel. In most situations, no action is required." 
</P>
<P>
If a medical question about a passenger arises after takeoff, the captain can 
radio ahead to the next airport if the matter is considered serious enough. 
Health authorities would then take a look at the passenger in question (and 
possibly other passengers as well) before the plane is cleared. 
</P>
<P>
"Cabin personnel have to apply a test of reasonableness in such situations," 
said a spokesman for the Air Traffic Assn., a trade association for airlines. 
"The flight report is an internal document and covers anything that happened 
during the flight, even a coffee maker that doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The general policy is that before the door to the plane closes, "it's the gate 
agent's judgment," the spokesman said. After the door closes, it's the 
captain's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice From Doctor 
</P>
<P>
Though time is an obvious factor, the gate agent and captain can seek medical 
advice from the airline's medical staff or advisers, either by phone or in 
person. Similarly, flight personnel may find a doctor on board who could give 
an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
If you are the person in question, getting a doctor's note is your 
responsibility. Whether you receive any amenities, such as meals and hotel 
accommodations, is up to the airline. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, airline personnel may have to exercise even more caution in how 
to handle such situations, especially where deplaning and refusing service are 
involved, according to Matt Finucane, safety director of the Assn. of Flight 
Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
"Passengers who are suspected of a serious communicable disease may have 
certain protection under new rules regarding handicapped passengers being 
proposed by the Department of Transportation," Finucane said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such passengers would be considered to be handicapped and protected against 
discrimination by carriers. If an airline deplaned a passenger who didn't have 
a communicable disease that could be transmitted during the flight, they might 
have a legal case on their hands." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bring Note Along 
</P>
<P>
If you have a condition that could arouse some attention, it might be prudent 
to carry a doctor's note. You can be refused service at check-in, and airline 
personnel have the discretion to ask for a doctor's note if your appearance 
creates doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Once you board the flight, it can be similarly useful to alert flight 
attendants immediately of any special circumstances or conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago I flew from New York City to Bombay, India, with a 
non-contagious but highly visible shaving/skin irritation that required 
frequent applications of an ointment prescribed by my dermatologist. 
</P>
<P>
The medication was both greasy and quite noticeable, so I casually explained 
the situation to the passenger sitting next to me, who initially didn't look 
overjoyed at my presence. There were other seats available, but he chose to 
stay put. 
</P>
<P>
If I were taking that flight today I would make sure I had a doctor's note 
explaining my condition/medication, to avoid any problems at check-in or during 
the flight. 
</P>
<P>
If a situation arises during flight, you can ask for another seat. But such 
relocation depends, obviously, on the availability of other seats and the 
degree of inconvenience or danger.

MOSCOW'S ART WONDER DOWN UNDER 
</P>

MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With or without Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost, as soon as you 
get to this bustling capital you should go underground. 
</P>
<P>
Your eyes will be arrested as you explore the city subway, truly one of 
Moscow's star attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro (as it is called) carries the highest density of riders (3.5 million 
a day) of any subway or railroad in the world. But this is not what makes the 
Moscow subway the wonder that it is. 
</P>
<P>
Muscovites are proud of their subterranean railroad and actively encourage 
tourists to descend for a look -- sometimes even taking them by the hand -- 
because the Metro is an art dream, an architectural knockout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look Like Palaces 
</P>
<P>
Once below, after having gotten used to the lighting system, the traveler finds 
himself wowed by stations that look like tunneled-out palaces. With crystal 
chandeliers and stairways and platforms made of granite, marble and 
semi-precious stones, each stop is a sight to see. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the stations have walls fitted with murals and frescoes, stained glass, 
artful floodlighting, molded stucco and other florid, grandiose features. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues and paintings galore by the Soviet Union's top artists, and 
several of the barrel-vaulted ceilings are covered with mosaics such as you see 
only in Italian churches. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are multicolored marble columns and rows and rows of 
eight-sided pylons that abound from station to station. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most striking stop is Kropotkinskaya Station. It was built by the 
Soviet Union's two top architects -- Dushkin and Likhtenberg -- who, allotted 
an equal share of space down below, were given a free hand to outdo one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a hodge of ornate splendor and a podge of stylistic designs that 
could give a rubberneck art critic a case of myopia. 
</P>
<P>
As there are more than 250 miles of track and 70 stations in the Metro, the 
tourist would want to hit the most interesting platforms, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable Muscovites who have explored every nook of the below-surface 
webwork say that one needs about two hours, but three would even be better. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to give it a quickie look, you'll find that visiting one station 
may just open your appetite for the full course. 
</P>
<P>
By entering the Prospekt Marya Station, whose entrance is close to the Moskva 
Hotel in the heart of the city, you will stop first at the Kropotkinskaya. Then 
you should take a train going in the same direction for pauses at the Park 
Kultury Station and the Leninskiye Station. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Transfer Points 
</P>
<P>
At this point, cross the platform and take a train going back to Park Kultury, 
where you transfer to a train that will take you to the Oktyabrskaya and 
Dobryninskaya Stations. 
</P>
<P>
Merely by making a few other transfers, the tourist who wants more of this 
optical profusion can easily visit the following stations: Komsomolskaya, 
Mayakovskaya, Kievskaya, Byelorusskaya and Plosechchad Sverdlova, at which 
point you can exit and find yourself back again at Revolution Square downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Getting around the subway, despite language problems, is a snap; simply copy 
down the station name in the Cyrillic letters and show them to any passenger. 
With engaging Russian hospitality, many led me personally to the proper 
platform. At times they even waited with me until my train came in before they 
went off in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
The trains, often traveling at 60 m.p.h., arrive every two minutes and are 
driverless (though a person does sit in the cab, just to make sure the 
automatic pilot functions). A powerful ventilation system changes the air seven 
times an hour and, according to the operation engineer's office, "You breathe 
purer air underground than you do at street level." 
</P>
<P>
No matter where you go, you will note a total absence of litter. Nor are there 
any graffiti defacing the cars or the walls. Vandalism and crime are virtually 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
But remember: Don't do the Moscow subway when business hours end. Like anywhere 
else in the world, it's the crush hour.

YOUTH BEAT: ECONOMY BEACH TOWNS NOT FAR FROM LISBON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

routes.

EVORA, Portugal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young travelers who reach Lisbon usually head south to soak up the sun on the 
popular Algarve coast. Yet near Lisbon are interesting and economical stops to 
make before you head for the beautiful beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Take a break from big-city sightseeing by riding an electric train from 
downtown Lisbon to the popular beach-front coastal towns of Estoril and 
Cascais. It takes 35 minutes to get to Estoril, and the cost is only 105 
escudos (about 75 cents U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
The beaches aren't like the Algarve but they are sandy, something you can't 
always count on when you visit European waterfront towns. 
</P>
<P>
Estoril was once home to European royalty and the wealthy. The beautiful villas 
that surround Europe's largest casino still remain. 
</P>
<P>
Cascais is just a little farther along the coast. It's the next stop by train, 
or you can walk along the waterfront, which is dominated by the remains of a 
guard tower. 
</P>
<P>
Cascais, a town of trendy shops and restaurants, has evolved out of the winding 
streets of a small fishing village. Colorful fishing boats and nets add to the 
atmosphere of the cheerful, busy beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not for Backpackers 
</P>
<P>
This area does not cater to the backpacking traveler, but at a few budget 
hotels rates for a double start at 2,000 escudos ($14 U.S.) in the winter 
season and 3,500 escudos in summer. Tourist information offices in both towns 
give directions. 
</P>
<P>
From Estoril take a 45-minute bus trip to Sintra. Because of its palaces and 
gardens, Sintra has been called the "fairy-tale city of Portugal." 
</P>
<P>
Buses leave each hour. The fare is 170 escudos ($1.20 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
Another interesting option is to travel inland from Lisbon to Evora, one of the 
oldest cities of the Iberian Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Evora is often referred to as Portugal's "museum town." When the Romans were 
there during the second century they built a beautiful temple to their goddess 
Diana. Much still remains. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent regional museum is housed in what was once the Bishop's Palace. 
For the bizarre, visit the Church of St. Francis; walls are decorated with the 
skulls and bones of about 5,000 monks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Bus Service 
</P>
<P>
If you are traveling on a Eurailpass you can use it to reach Evora from Lisbon. 
The trip takes about three hours. On many routes in Portugal, buses provide 
more frequent and faster service than trains. 
</P>
<P>
A two-hour express bus from Lisbon to Evora costs 650 escudos. The non-express 
bus service takes about three hours and costs 585 escudos. 
</P>
<P>
It's best to start in Evora at the tourist information office, which faces the 
main Praca Do Giraldo square. You can store your luggage at the bus or rail 
station but the rail station is not as central. 
</P>
<P>
At the tourist information office you can get a list of lodgings and a map with 
directions to the youth hostel, formerly a private home, at 32 Rua de 
Corredoura. It's a 10-minute walk from the tourist office. The hostel opens 
between 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., depending on the season, and has a curfew at 
10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showers May Be Cold 
</P>
<P>
At 500 escudos for accommodations and continental breakfast, the price is 
right. But don't count on hot water for the showers. 
</P>
<P>
The hostel staff is helpful with information about sights to see, good 
economical restaurants and bus and rail information. Kitchen facilities are 
available. A supermarket is near the main bus terminal. 
</P>
<P>
In Portugal, International Student Identity Cards are good for free admission 
to 30 museums and palaces (this does not include private museums). 
</P>
<P>
The fee for exchanging traveler's checks is high, however. One bank charged 500 
escudos, plus 45 escudos tax. So shop around and try not to make more 
transactions than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on travel to Portugal, contact the Portuguese National 
Tourist Office, 590 Fifth Ave., New York 10036, (212) 354-4403.

THE BARGAIN CORNER: DOWN UNDER COUPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down Under hotel coupons, good at more than 60 hotels in Australia, New 
Zealand, Tahiti and Fiji and valid through March 31, 1990, are available from 
Southern Pacific Hotel Corp. One must buy a minimum of 12 at $38 per coupon, a 
discount from regular rates. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the hotels are in Australia and New Zealand. Two to four coupons per 
room are required for a one-night stay at the hotels, except for one property 
in Tahiti, where five may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
The number of coupons hotels take may vary depending on the time of year, and 
the hotels may not always honor the coupons. So check beforehand. More coupons 
will be required for a room during the October-April high season. 
</P>
<P>
Coupons have to be bought in the United States. Hotel reservations can be made 
either before departure or overseas. Booking the first night abroad while still 
in the United States is always a good idea. The coupons don't have to be used 
on consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cost of a coupon is frozen to the end of this year, the rate could 
go up in 1990. Also, Southern Pacific may add a surcharge if there's a major 
fluctuation in the exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
When sharing a room with an adult, children 18 or younger can stay free. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities with hotels in this program are Sydney, Melbourne, Cairns, 
Canberra, Brisbane, Darwin, Perth and Alice Springs in Australia; Auckland, 
Rotorua, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown in New Zealand, and Suva and 
Nadi, Fiji, and Papeete in Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
No refunds if the minimum 12 coupons aren't used. However, there's a refund for 
extra unused coupons, minus a handling fee of $10 per order. 
</P>
<P>
Contact travel agents or Southern Pacific Hotel at toll-free (800) 252-2155 or 
(213) 557-2424.

French Rail and Hertz are continuing their Hertz Euraildrive Escape program. 
The 1989 program offers seven days of rail travel and three car-rental days 
over 21 days for $269 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Two people have to travel together, with the rail portion only on first-class. 
The offer is good throughout most of Europe, and you don't have to visit 
France. There may be a VAT charge on the car rental. 
</P>
<P>
The passes have to be bought in the United States and are valid for six months 
from the date of issue. Contact travel agents.

Update: Aerolineas Argentinas has revised its Visit Argentina pass, as of March 
1. Instead of a 14-day pass for $199 and 30-day pass for $290, you can now buy 
4 one-way flight coupons to fly within the country for $199; 6 coupons, $249; 8 
coupons, $299, and 10 coupons for $349. 
</P>
<P>
The coupons must be used within 30 days. They have to be purchased in the 
United States, and you now have to fly to Argentina on Aerolineas Argentinas.

Hulse's nice little article about Kaua's Na Pali coast was surely the height of 
irony. It extolled the beauty of this magnificent spot that "remains silent 
save for the voice of the wind" . . .etc. That is what I hiked for miles to 
find. It is not there anymore. Instead there is a pervasive and intrusive 
chatter, clatter and roar of helicopters overhead every 20 minutes and zodiacs 
off the shore carrying hordes of tourists. I don't know when I have gone so 
far, spent so much and exerted myself so much to be so disappointed. It is a 
crying shame that what could be a rare glimpse of paradise is ruined by 
care-less commercialism. Try it . . you won't like it!

ICE IN MAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a pleasure to read Elliott Almond and Valerie Ice's article on "Maine" 
(March 12), in which Acadia National Park was discussed. Having lived on Mount 
Desert Island for 10 years and authored two books on the park, it is fun to be 
reminded of all the good times in one of my most favorite national parks. 
</P>
<P>
However, there were a number of mistakes. Father Pierre Biard (not "Baird") 
settled at Fernald Point in 1613. The landscape architect was Frederick Law 
Olmsted (not "Fredrick Law Almstead"). There is no "Beaver Mountain"; perhaps 
the authors meant Brewer Mountain, which is near Eagle Lake. The park is 
southeast, rather than "east" of Bangor, and Ellsworth is northwest of Bar 
Harbor, rather than "west." The town is Southwest Harbor, not "Southeast 
Harbor." And the ZIP code for Bar Harbor, Me., is 04609, not 04347.

GOOD RUSSIAN FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have visited the Soviet Union five times, so I was dismayed when I read 
"Carry Your Own Food for Good Eating in Moscow" (March 5) by Dianne Rhinehart. 
In all the hotels in which I have stayed -- Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Lvov, 
Kishniev, Yalta -- the food always has been excellent, the servings plentiful 
and the service efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Also, each hotel has a service bureau that will arrange lunches or dinners at 
various restaurants where visitors can sample different ethnic cuisines, for 
example, those of the Ukraine, Armenia, Uzbekistan and other parts of Soviet 
Central Asia. And when you visit a restaurant frequented mostly by locals, be 
prepared to be invited to dance by them. They may not speak English and you may 
not speak Russian -- but the communal language in the country is music! More 
and more Americans are discovering the delights of traveling around the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
My recommendation to first-time visitors: Take along an open mind and a 
friendly attitude. And a big appetite! I guarantee you will have a wonderful 
time and will bring home many fond memories. As for the food: You might gain a 
few pounds. You certainly will not go hungry!

STATE DELAYS PICKING SITE FOR PAROLE OFFICE 
</P>

<P>
City officials have won a temporary delay in the establishment of a state 
parole office on Rosemead Boulevard while they help corrections officials find 
an alternate site. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. said the state Department of Corrections has 
promised to delay signing a lease while the search goes on. But if a suitable 
site cannot be found in a month or two, Thomson said, the department has made 
it clear that it will go ahead with plans to move the regional parole office 
from Alhambra to a building at 468 N. Rosemead Blvd. in Pasadena's Hastings 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alhambra Opposition 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in recent months that state officials have run into 
opposition to the location of a parole office in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Community opposition to the parole office in Alhambra prompted state officials 
to promise to move it by Oct. 1. Alhambra and Monterey Park police contend that 
crime has risen since the office, which is near the border of the two cities, 
was opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, City Director Jess Hughston and Harold Britton, president of the Lower 
Hastings Ranch Homeowners Assn., met last week in Sacramento with state 
officials to argue against the Rosemead Boulevard site. Hastings Ranch 
residents say they fear that bringing parolees to their neighborhood will 
increase crime. State officials deny there is a link between parole offices and 
crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
The city delegation met with Joe Sandoval, secretary of the Youth and Adult 
Correctional Agency; Craig Brown, undersecretary of the agency, and Stephen 
Blankenship, the governor's deputy legislative secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said the parole office requires 10,000 square feet on a ground floor at 
a site that has 30 to 40 parking spaces and is accessible to public 
transportation. He said the state does not insist that the office be in 
Pasadena, but only in the general area. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, in order to minimize concern by the public, the office should be 
placed away from homes, schools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very difficult to find a site that will have only minimal 
concern, much less be free of community concern," the mayor said. Nevertheless, 
he said, the city, aided by real estate brokers and community groups, will work 
with the state to seek a better location.

VALLEY BLVD. IS A CHALLENGE FOR PLANNERS IN ALHAMBRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

ALHAMBRA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valley Boulevard, which had existed for decades in the shadow of Main Street, 
is coming of age. 
</P>
<P>
The boulevard has always been a busy commercial area but was never the heart of 
the city. Main Street, where the major department stores were located, was the 
place to be for shopping and fun. 
</P>
<P>
Some 20 years ago, the Junior Chamber of Commerce even hosted a "Hi Neighbor" 
parade on the boulevard featuring as the grand marshal Cheryl Tiegs, an 
Alhambra High School graduate turned cover girl. Organizers had hoped the 
parade would draw more attention and business to Valley Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't help any," said Dick Nichols, executive director of the Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
But in the early 1980s, business began booming on Valley as Asian immigrants 
and other entrepreneurs established businesses ranging from restaurants to 
supermarkets to furniture stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1 Million in Sales Taxes 
</P>
<P>
The goods and services attract shoppers from as far away as Anaheim and Sun 
Valley, raking in nearly $1 million in sales taxes a year for the city and 
turning Valley Boulevard between New Avenue and the Long Beach Freeway into a 
regional shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
Development has been taking place so rapidly -- since 1980, more than 280,000 
square feet of new development has occurred on Valley -- that the City Council 
became alarmed about the effect of uncontrolled growth. 
</P>
<P>
So city planners are preparing a plan that will examine issues such as the 
environmental and traffic impacts of new developments, minimum lot sizes and 
the development of commercial "nodes," described as a more concentrated 
collection of businesses at major intersections on Valley, such as Atlantic 
Boulevard and Fremont and Garfield avenues. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want these to be arbitrary rules and regulations," said Mark Persico, 
an associate city planner. "We want to control development on Valley Boulevard. 
We don't want to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to concerns such as traffic congestion and building density, some 
council members are receiving complaints from residents about the boulevard's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you look, you see a junk store going up," said Councilwoman Barbara 
Messina, who lives two blocks north of Valley. She cited as an example one tiny 
store crammed with everything from toys to pots and pans. Business signs have 
also become a problem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the Asian signs," Messina said. Excessive and 
unprofessional-looking signs have made some businesses look tacky, she said. 
Improving the aesthetics of the boulevard was one reason why the council last 
fall approved plans to install medians between Ethel and Garfield avenues, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the city has paid more attention to Main Street, said City 
Manager Kevin Murphy. "That's one reason why you have a low-density hodgepodge 
look (on Valley) now." 
</P>
<P>
To get more control over future developments on Valley, the council has 
directed staff members to draft a specific plan -- the first of its kind in the 
city -- which it hopes will help shape development along the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A specific plan details what percentage of an area should be devoted to certain 
uses and what type of projects -- hotels, restaurants, apartments -- the city 
wants developed. 
</P>
<P>
City planners have been meeting with a Valley Boulevard steering committee to 
work out details of the plan, which is scheduled to be presented to the public 
in late October. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the planning process, the council on Feb. 27 extended a moratorium 
halting new construction on Valley. The freeze will be in effect for another 10 
months, or until the specific plan is completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on Permits 
</P>
<P>
During the moratorium, the city will only issue construction permits for 
additions to existing buildings if the addition is less than 20% of the 
building, or 4,000 square feet, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also denying requests for land use changes that increase the demand 
for parking. 
</P>
<P>
Exemptions may be granted to developers whose projects have been approved by 
the Planning Commission, said associate planner Persico. Four to five pending 
projects fall into that category, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to draft a specific plan is generally welcomed by the business 
community, which has long hungered for detailed development guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction has been favorable," Nichols said. "Even though none of us likes 
the moratorium, it (specific plan) is needed." 
</P>
<P>
Some business owners do have reservations, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in favor of the city's plan, but not rigid control" said Fred Fong, owner 
of Fong Realty on Valley. "I don't know if the city has the right to control 
what type of business they (entrepreneurs) can get into." 
</P>
<P>
Valley Boulevard's three-mile stretch through Alhambra is part of a major 
thoroughfare cutting across the southern portion of the San Gabriel Valley. 
Linking communities from Pomona to Alhambra, the boulevard -- which predates 
both the Pomona and San Bernardino freeways -- ends just south of Lincoln 
Heights in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As it winds through the city, Valley undergoes several metamorphoses, changing 
from a collection of auto repair shops on the west end to Asian supermarkets 
and restaurants in the middle to national chain stores and markets on the 
eastern edge of town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formerly Italian Area 
</P>
<P>
The boulevard was where Italian-Americans 30 years ago first opened 
delicatessens, novelty shops, and other businesses after moving to Alhambra 
from Lincoln Heights and elsewhere in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Venti Sr., a barber-turned-Realtor who was raised in Los Angeles, said 
he had never seen so many fellow Italians until he moved to Alhambra in 1953. 
He remembers the boulevard as a promising place to start a business. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that opened on Valley Boulevard instantly became a success," said 
Venti, now president of Anthony Venti Realtors. It's even more so today, he 
said, adding that entrepreneurs snap up retail space and offices faster than 
they can be built. 
</P>
<P>
"We lease them out before we even finish with them," Venti said. "You can't do 
that on Main Street." 
</P>
<P>
He said the secret to Valley is its status as a major artery through the San 
Gabriel Valley, even after the San Bernardino and Pomona freeways were built. 
Business owners had worried that the freeways would siphon off traffic and 
customers, Venti said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it never happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asian Market 
</P>
<P>
Immigration during the past eight to 10 years has pushed the city's Asian 
population to almost 30% of the city's 73,126 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Situated less than a mile from Monterey Park -- the San Gabriel Valley's 
original hub of Asian immigration -- Valley Boulevard became a natural choice 
for business owners interested in capturing the Asian market. 
</P>
<P>
The new immigrants opened businesses that both revitalized and altered the look 
of the boulevard. Crawford's Market at Atlantic Boulevard, for example, has 
given way to the M. W. Asian supermarket, and the Garfield Theater at Garfield 
Avenue now features Chinese-language films. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed with Bob's Big Boy, Shakey's Pizza and Pioneer Chicken are Asian 
delicatessens, beauty salons and bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
The corner of Garfield Avenue and Valley Boulevard is a stark juxtaposition of 
cultures. On the northeast corner sits the Hong Kong bakery, which offers 
Chinese sweets, such as almond cookies and, during the Chinese Autumn Festival, 
little "mooncakes" filled with lotus or sweet red beans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Bit of Old Alhambra 
</P>
<P>
Across the street sits a bit of old Alhambra -- an open-air sandwich and 
hamburger stand called The Hat. 
</P>
<P>
The place hasn't changed much since the day it opened in 1951, old-timers said. 
It is still where residents can grab a hot pastrami sandwich -- billed as the 
best in the world -- and a 15-cent cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Former Alhambra residents, many of them from out of state, stop in at the stand 
when they are in town, said manager Susana Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"They're happy to see the place standing," Williams said. When she was growing 
up in Alhambra, Williams said, she used to go to the movies at the Garfield 
Theater and afterward, stroll across the street to The Hat for a pastrami 
sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners and developers have approached Michael Paules, assistant city 
manager, with ideas about how the boulevard should be developed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crystal Ball Time 
</P>
<P>
"They are coming to us asking us to use our crystal ball to see what the plan 
will say about their property," said Paules, who said their input will help him 
draft a plan the community will accept. 
</P>
<P>
To help collect data needed to compile the specific plan, the council has hired 
three consulting firms at an estimated cost of $83,000. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Brandman Associates of Los Angeles is the planning consulting firm; 
Keyser Marston Associates is providing economic analyses, and Willdan 
Associates has been hired to provide traffic analyses. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Williams, a Chamber of Commerce representative on the Valley Boulevard 
steering committee, said that because it is difficult for the city's section of 
the boulevard to thrive on just retail businesses, he envisions some apartment 
and condominium complexes and two-story office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have a mixture of residential, commercial and retail," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City planners said more detailed planning will make it easier for them to 
evaluate development proposals from entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all done through the zoning ordinance and the General Plan, which are 
good planning tools, but they are very broad," Persico said of the city's 
method of assessing development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downtown Plan 
</P>
<P>
Developers contemplating projects on Main Street, about a mile north of Valley, 
say they wish a specific plan could also be produced for downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Cherng, president of Panda Management Co., left a recent redevelopment 
agency meeting feeling frustrated, not because his proposal to build a Panda 
Inn restaurant/retail center on Main Street was rejected, but because he said 
the agency did not offer any clues as to what type of project it wants. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get any idea what you are allowed to develop there," Cherng said of 
the site at 5th and Main streets. "There is no indication. That, I think, makes 
it difficult to conduct business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Storefront Renovations 
</P>
<P>
While the city is mapping out the future of Valley, some property and business 
owners are already busy renovating storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Alhambra Valley Center, a 32-year-old commercial center carved out 
of an old airfield near Almansor Street, is now undergoing a face lift and will 
soon be renamed The Market Place. Instead of Zody's, a discount department 
store that went out of business there about three years ago, the shopping 
center now features HQ, an office supply store. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and members of the business community are all anxious to see a 
final draft of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams, of the Chamber of Commerce, "The business owners, they are 
looking forward to the upshot of all this."

MONTEREY PARK, STAR 'MELTING POT,' GETTING FED UP WITH THE PUBLICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last five years, Monterey Park has endured an uncomfortable 
journalistic spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters throughout the world are attracted by the melting-pot, immigration 
story of a Los Angeles suburb struggling with rapid sociological changes. 
</P>
<P>
But the frequent outside analysis has become tiring for the interview-savvy 
residents of a town that immigration changed from an Anglo-majority city into 
an Asian-majority one. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Christopher F. Houseman half-seriously suggested that the city 
should charge filming rights. "I think people of the town get a little fatigued 
from having the bright lights on them. It's like they're on a movie set all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
When Channel 2 television crews from KCBS came to film several months ago, 
Houseman complained about "the Monterey Park movie ranch." 
</P>
<P>
And now community leaders are fretting about the latest media foray into the 
San Gabriel Valley: the ABC News magazine show, "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
With a mixture of pride and discomfort, residents await the airing of the 
network television show, tentatively scheduled for sometime in April. And 
residents say they worry that all this journalistic notice creates a distorted 
picture and makes community life difficult when neighbor is pitted against 
neighbor in 15-second sound bites or 15-paragraph stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'd do a better job if we weren't on the front page all the time," 
said Councilwoman Betty Couch, who was interviewed but not filmed by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tensions Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
"You know my story: Development is the main issue in Monterey Park, not 
racism," she said. "But I guess that's not what they want to hear on film." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Patricia Reichenberger said she spoke with "20/20" but declined to 
be filmed because she feared the story would be one of "yellows against the 
whites." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Chu, the only council member whose ancestry is Asian, acknowledged the 
tensions over changes in the city's ethnic makeup in her filmed interview. 
"It's been painful. But people are starting to shift. I hope that comes across" 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good things in Monterey Park, and I'm concerned about the 
media portraying Monterey Park in a distorted way," she said. "That was the 
main message I gave in my interview. 
</P>
<P>
Lily Lee Chen, former mayor and council member, said: "We take pride for our 
accomplishments. But rather than having '20/20' to come in and generate 
controversies, (it's) now the time to leave us alone and give us a chance to 
iron out our problems." 
</P>
<P>
For an essentially residential community with a population of 63,500 -- besides 
the Asian majority, one-third of the residents are Latino -- Monterey Park has 
had its share of attention. 
</P>
<P>
The focus in large part began in 1983, when news stories circulated about 
Chen's becoming the nation's first mayor who was a Chinese-American woman. 
</P>
<P>
Outspoken Chen was mayor when the city acted as host to the Olympics field 
hockey competition in 1984, and she worked on the community's successful 
application to be named "an All-American City" in 1985 during efforts to 
promote racial harmony. But there were tensions then too, such as the libel 
suit filed against Chen after she complained about a sign in a service station 
that said: "Will the last American leaving Monterey Park please take down the 
American flag." 
</P>
<P>
Now, in Barry L. Hatch, the city has an outspoken mayor who wants a temporary 
ban on immigration and advocates that English be declared the nation's official 
language. 
</P>
<P>
More than once, Cable News Network has come to the city that journalists have 
referred to as "a suburban Chinatown" and "the Chinese Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
"The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on public television, the Washington Post and NBC 
have reported on Monterey Park. Foreign film crews have been there. Recently a 
student film crew came from Cal State Northridge. Atlantic Monthly last year 
featured the city in an article titled "Growing Pains." 
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to the frequent coverage given in the Los Angeles Times and 
in local and statewide newspapers. Four daily Chinese-language newspapers are 
published in Monterey Park and are distributed internationally. 
English-language magazines and newspapers aimed at Asian-American readers often 
report Monterey Park stories, such as a dispute about foreign-language books in 
the library and the debate about the amount of Chinese characters on business 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'City of Exploitation' 
</P>
<P>
"We've become the city of exploitation, with outsiders swooping in," Houseman 
said. "I don't know what ABC was doing in town. A sociological story? A 
political story? A critical story?" 
</P>
<P>
For its part, ABC has declined to talk about the story, except to say that one 
is being done. 
</P>
<P>
The television segment's genesis was partly due to comments made by Hatch, who 
these days is being quoted from Honolulu to Philadelphia and points in between. 
</P>
<P>
A producer from "20/20" contacted Hatch in February to say that she had read a 
front-page article in the Philadelphia Inquirer quoting Hatch. The Feb. 2 
story, "Immigration Spurs Debate Over English," quoted Hatch as saying: 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we're losing our country. They're buying up our property. 
They're taking Western culture out and replacing it with Eastern culture and 
Latin culture. They're taking us over. If their language is set up, all the 
rest will crumble." 
</P>
<P>
The article referred to Hatch as "the controversial mayor of Monterey Park, who 
sees his battle for English as a rear-guard action against the decline of 
Western civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch willingly has sounded this theme for journalists as a way to gain a forum 
for his view that the immigration problems of Monterey Park are the same as the 
nation's. He often is a guest on radio talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his belief that the news media has a liberal bias, Hatch said, 
interviews afford a chance to spread his conservative views. "I could not turn 
down the opportunity to get a portion of my message across." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made It 'a Duel' 
</P>
<P>
But, he complained that during the ABC interview "they wouldn't let me expound 
on the issues. They wanted to keep it to a duel here in Monterey Park between 
the forces that be." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hatch was upset that ABC interviewed Stephen Tan, now a planning 
commissioner, who two years ago was a leader of the unsuccessful movement to 
recall Hatch and Reichenberger. 
</P>
<P>
Tan said he too was unsettled by his "20/20" interview because he was asked 
questions about Hatch and the recall campaign. "I said: 'Let the past be the 
past.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even though he was told the show would be a chance for him to address millions 
of television watchers, Tan said, he was reluctant to be interviewed for fear 
his comments might be misconstrued in Monterey Park as well as throughout the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to think of the city as in hot water. I only want to talk 
about the good things and my ideas of how to get everybody together." 
</P>
<P>
But Tan, who moved to Los Angeles from Malaysia 10 years ago, said he was glad 
he could talk about Monterey Park in the context of the history of American 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, when the Jews came, the Italians came, the Spanish and the Irish came, 
we had all kinds of misunderstandings. Then there was the Japanese and now the 
Chinese. It's not a problem because they're Chinese. It's really just because 
they are the newcomers."

NAMIBIA CLASH SPURS S. AFRICA THREAT TO U.N. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

WINDHOEK, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa threatened Saturday to expel a large U.N. peacekeeping force on 
its first day of work in Namibia after charging that guerrillas entering from 
Angola had clashed with Namibian police as a formal cease-fire went into 
effect, leaving 38 insurgents and two police officers dead. 
</P>
<P>
Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, called the clash a 
"flagrant violation" of international agreements. He said that if the U.N. 
secretary general did not issue a clear statement on the matter, South Africa 
would ask U.N. peacekeepers to leave until the South-West Africa People's 
Organization (SWAPO), which has fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South 
African control, "can be brought to its senses." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Botha's threat, it was considered unlikely that South Africa would 
expel the U.N. team that is here to oversee Namibia's transition to 
independence because that would wreck the entire process and allow Cuba to 
renege on its agreement to withdraw its troops from neighboring Angola. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO officials declined to comment Saturday, saying they needed more 
information about the incidents before answering South Africa's charges. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said he would 
send a four-member team to the area of the clashes, about 400 miles north of 
Windhoek, today. Ahtisaari considered them "a very serious development," 
according to a U.N. spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to go up there and find out for ourselves" what happened, said 
Frederic Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman in Windhoek, the Namibian capital. Eckhard 
added that "it's safe to say" that U.N. peacekeeping forces were not involved. 
</P>
<P>
Statements issued by Botha and Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator 
in charge of Namibia, cited three separate incidents along 120 miles of the 
Namibia-Angola border, beginning before the cease-fire went into effect at 6 
a.m. local time Saturday. They said a group of 40 to 50 armed men entered 
Namibia near Ruacana, a second group of about 50 entered near Oshikango and a 
third group was encountered halfway between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of Atrocities 
</P>
<P>
Security police sources in northern Namibia told The Times that the incursions 
were repelled by units of Koevoet, a counterinsurgency unit of 3,000 black 
Namibians under the command of white South Africans. The unit, which has been 
accused of widespread atrocities, was recently returned to normal police work 
and incorporated into Namibia's police force. 
</P>
<P>
The sources could not confirm the number killed in the attacks but said two 
alleged SWAPO guerrillas had been captured and others were being sought late 
Saturday night. Botha said 14 police officers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Botha did not specify what weapons were used by either side, but under the U.N. 
peace plan Namibia's police were to begin carrying only pistols "in the normal 
performance of their duties." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
December Agreement 
</P>
<P>
The incidents apparently marked the first serious clashes between SWAPO and 
South African-backed Namibian authorities since South Africa, Cuba and Angola 
signed an agreement in December that paved the way for Namibia's independence 
and the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N. plan intended to lead to free and fair elections here in November, 
both SWAPO and the South African Defense Force were restricted to their bases 
beginning on Saturday. Most of SWAPO's bases are in southern Angola. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa is conducting the transition to Namibian independence, but its 
actions are subject to the approval of the United Nations, which, at peak 
periods, will have a team of about 7,000 soldiers, police and administrators to 
monitor the process. SWAPO, with strong support among residents of the most 
populous northern region, is favored to win the elections. 
</P>
<P>
In Windhoek's black township of Katutura on Saturday, tens of thousands of 
Namibians donned the bright colors of their political parties to try out their 
new freedom and begin campaigning to govern Africa's last colony. 
</P>
<P>
Police stopped several thousand trade unionists as they began a march from the 
township to Windhoek to protest a move to sell Namibian enterprises to private 
investors. The group dispersed without incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jubilant Crowds 
</P>
<P>
Namibia's two major political parties -- the Marxist-oriented, predominantly 
black SWAPO and the capitalist, multiracial Democratic Turnhalle Alliance -- 
drew jubilant, singing crowds of about 5,000 each to rallies less than two 
miles apart. The country's first unfettered political campaigning, conducted 
under a hot sun, was generally peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
Namibia is a mostly desert territory twice the size of California on the 
southwest coast of Africa. Its population of 1.5 million is overwhelmingly 
black, and more than half live in the northern Ovambo province, the seat of 
SWAPO support. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of SWAPO guerrillas have been killed since 1965, when the 
group launched its war with South Africa, which has controlled this territory 
for 74 years -- the last 20 years in defiance of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, South Africa had questioned the United Nations' impartiality in 
Namibia because the international body had once declared SWAPO the "sole and 
authentic" representative of the people of Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations currently has only about 1,000 peacekeeping troops in the 
country, and U.N. officials say the full force of 4,650 troops will not arrive 
until May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The troop deployment was delayed by haggling at the United Nations earlier this 
year over the cost of the mission. To cut the cost, now set at $461 million, 
the United States and the Soviet Union reduced -- to 4,650 from the originally 
planned 6,000 -- the number of troops for Namibia's transition to independence 
and black majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on a one-day visit to Namibia, said 
Saturday the border incidents were "a most serious challenge" to the Namibian 
peace process and she called for a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council 
to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW ERA FOR NAMIBIA 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday marked the start of a transition period for Namibia under a regional 
accord reached in December by Angola, Cuba and South Africa, which has 
administered the huge, sparsely populated territory since World War I. Hours 
before the transition began, South Africa reported major clashes with 
guerrillas in northern Namibia near Ruacana and Oshikango. Provisions of the 
plan: 
</P>
<P>
 April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official; 
U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of 7,000-member U.N. 
Transition Assistance Group that will oversee transition. South African troops 
in Namibia and guerrillas of South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), 
based in neighboring Angola, are confined to bases. 
</P>
<P>
May 14 -- South African security force is to be disbanded; South Africa is to 
reduce its troops to 12,000. South African administrator Louis Pienaar is to 
publish election rules, subject to U.N. approval. 
</P>
<P>
June 3 -- Political prisoners to be freed; Namibian exiles to return. 
</P>
<P>
July 1 -- South Africa's forces to be cut to 1,500; election campaigning to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 31 -- Half of Cuba's 50,000 troops are to have left Angola; rest are to 
withdraw north of 13th Parallel. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 1 -- Elections are to be held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered 
to approve constitution for independent Namibia -- the independence date to be 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops are to leave. 
</P>
<P>
April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate is to end. 
</P>
<P>
July 1, 1991 -- Cubans are to withdraw last troops.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. Doug Baily asked New York authorities on Saturday to arrest 
Joseph Hazelwood, captain of the oil tanker that ran aground here last week, 
and extradite him to face three misdemeanor criminal charges stemming from his 
role in the worst oil spill in North American history. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other Alaskan officials on Saturday indefinitely postponed the 
fishing season for shrimp and sablefish and were debating whether to cancel a 
third, even more valuable, season for herring roe because of the hundreds of 
thousands of barrels of emulsified crude oil still sloshing around Prince 
William Sound, fouling close to 100 miles of beaches and infiltrating into the 
Gulf of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, cleanup crews from Exxon labored to get a handle on the 
widely dispersed spill, trying to coax oil the consistency of "black 
mayonnaise" off the water and beaches while still draining oil from the 
987-foot Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, loaded with 1.2 million barrels of North Slope crude, strayed out 
of normal sea lanes while under the command of an inexperienced crew member and 
ran aground on March 24. Coast Guard officials said 10 of the tanker's 15 
compartments were punctured, releasing an estimated 240,000 barrels into 
wildlife-rich Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Baily said charges filed late Friday accused the tanker's 42-year-old captain, 
whose blood-alcohol level exceeded legal limits when sampled 10 1/2 hours after 
the accident, of operating a ship under the influence of alcohol, reckless 
endangerment and criminally negligent discharge of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Maximum penalty for the combined charges is 27 months in jail and a $10,000 
fine. Baily said he filed the charges and sought extradition after learning 
that Hazelwood had left the state before Alaskan criminal investigators could 
question him. 
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Tracee Schnell in Anchorage issued the arrest warrant and set bail 
at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Suffolk County, N.Y., were reportedly attempting to locate Hazelwood, 
but it was not clear whether New York state authorities would extradite him to 
face misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
In Valdez and the nearby fishing town of Cordova, fishermen reacted bitterly to 
news that the shrimp and sablefish seasons have been postponed and possibly 
canceled this year. Even worse was news that the state may drop the lucrative 
herring roe season that was set to start Saturday. Herring roe, or eggs, are a 
delicacy in Japan and fetch high prices, giving fishermen an early economic 
boost to carry them through to the summer salmon season. 
</P>
<P>
Animosity toward Exxon has led the oil giant to cancel its regular town 
meetings on the spills and beef up security around its temporary headquarters 
in the Westmark Hotel. Valdez Mayor John Devens, sensing the potential for 
trouble, has asked Exxon not to bring the leaking tanker to Valdez for repairs 
once the behemoth is drained of oil and refloated, an event scheduled for 
Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Iarossi, president of Exxon Shipping Co., said, "Our objective is to get 
(the tanker) out of Prince William Sound just as soon as we can," but he said 
the ship may need temporary repairs that can only be attempted at Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Draining and floating the tanker will be a difficult job, Valdez Coast Guard 
Cmdr. Steve McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want it floating before you want it to float," he said to explain 
why it is taking so long to remove oil left in the tanker. "Otherwise, it could 
slide off the rocks . . . and then sink or roll over or have a really bad 
list." 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the 1 million barrels of oil that did not leak from the 
ship have been transferred to other tankers and shipped out of Alaska, Exxon 
representatives said. Even after all that can be removed is taken, Iarossi said 
about 30,000 barrels of oil will remain on the ship, along with several hundred 
thousand barrels of heavily oiled seawater, when it is refloated. 
</P>
<P>
A barrel is a standard oil industry measurement equivalent to 42 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
As the leaked oil continues to foul beaches and spread, Alaska Gov. Steve 
Cowper said he has accepted offers of international assistance from Norwegian 
biologists and a Soviet oil-skimming boat, but it is unclear whether Exxon will 
agree to accept those offers.

U.S., VENEZUELA OK STEPPED-UP EFFORT ON DEBT

<P>
President Bush and Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez agreed Saturday to 
begin intensive work on a plan to reduce Venezuela's $33-billion foreign debt, 
making the country one of the first "test cases" of America's new Third World 
debt strategy. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the meeting between the two leaders, which lasted for 
almost two hours, was designed both to provide new political impetus to the 
effort to help Venezuela with its debt problems and to coordinate the two 
leaders' policies on Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said top economic policy-makers from the two countries 
would begin intensive sessions this week to work out a concrete debt-reduction 
plan. The Venezuelans are here for a meeting of the 151-nation International 
Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how much in actual debt relief Venezuela would be 
able to obtain. Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady is to unveil the 
broader U.S. debt strategy at a special meeting today of finance ministers from 
seven major industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Reaction to U.S. Plan 
</P>
<P>
Initial reaction to the U.S. proposal, which Brady outlined broadly on March 
10, has been mixed. U.S. officials say support from Perez, who is one of South 
America's elder statesmen, could have a major impact on how other Third World 
countries react to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus (at the White House meeting) was on implementation (of the new debt 
relief ideas) -- let's get on with it," a U.S. official said. "Nobody has any 
question about the urgency of the economic situation in Venezuela." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Bush and Brady, Secretary of State James A. Baker III also attended the 
White House meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The new Brady debt plan essentially would offer to help debtor countries reduce 
the cost and size of their huge foreign debt by asking the IMF and the World 
Bank to serve as catalysts for schemes under which banks could write down their 
loans and swap them for guaranteed bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is designed to replace the previous debt strategy, outlined by 
Baker when he was Treasury secretary in 1985, which called on banks to provide 
new loans to help debtor countries finance economic reforms. (See related story 
in Business, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, the oldest democracy in Latin America and a major oil producer, has 
been in a crunch since oil prices collapsed in the early 1980s. Perez, a 
moderate socialist, imposed economic reforms after his inauguration in January, 
touching off riots that claimed 300 lives. 
</P>
<P>
Although Perez publicly has blamed the riots on the "intolerable and obscene" 
burden of repaying his country's foreign debt, U.S. officials said he struck a 
more conciliatory and pragmatic tone in his talks with Bush, promising to 
continue overhauling his economy. 
</P>
<P>
"He made it clear that he understands that countries that don't reform and 
restructure their economies can't escape blame for their own problems," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Venezuelan officials have already held preliminary talks to discuss a 
debt reduction strategy, but Bush and Perez directed their aides to accelerate 
the negotiations this week, several officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury officials have been hoping to move quickly to apply the new plan to 
two or three countries in hopes of blunting criticism that the proposal is 
ineffective and making it more credible to debtor countries, many of which are 
embroiled in political unrest and are facing leftist challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Venezuela, U.S. officials also have been considering Mexico as a 
candidate for quick action under the new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investment Potential 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the potential for Venezuela as one of the first test cases (of 
the Brady plan)," the official said. "As an oil exporter, Venezuela can attract 
new capital flows better than some other countries." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said it was too early to predict how soon a concrete plan for 
reducing Venezuela's debt might be ready, however. 
</P>
<P>
The United States wants finance ministers of the seven largest non-Communist 
industrial nations to endorse the plan today and agree to refine it further 
between now and the seven-nation economic summit in Paris in July. Besides the 
United States, the group includes Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In their meeting Saturday, Bush and Perez also discussed the situation in 
Nicaragua, where the Administration has launched a new strategy to put 
diplomatic pressure on the ruling Sandinista regime for democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its pressure, the Administration has won approval from congressional 
leaders for continued non-military aid to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who has played a key role as a mediator between the Sandinistas and 
Nicaraguan opposition groups, assured Bush of his general support for the new 
U.S. approach and said he understood the rationale for the continued Contra 
aid, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Venezuelan disappointed some U.S. officials by ducking an opportunity 
to make his support public when he left the White House without pausing to talk 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Perez also discussed the situation in Panama, where the United States 
has mounted an abortive campaign to oust the military strongman, Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Bush, Perez has been pressing Noriega to allow free elections in 
Panama next month, although U.S. and Venezuelan officials are privately 
pessimistic about the chances for an untainted vote.

A GLORIOUS FEAT?;

<P>
PEARY FOES, BACKERS STILL POLES APART 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In April of 1909, in raw and cruel climes of 30 below zero, Cmdr. Robert Edwin 
Peary, hooded and covered in bearskin, penciled some fabled words onto a page 
in the small, brown notebook that served as his Arctic diary. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pole at last!!!" Peary wrote in his slanted, careful, clear hand. "The 
prize of 3 centuries, my dream and ambition for 23 years. Mine at last. I 
cannot bring myself to realize it. It all seems so simple &amp; commonplace. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
The notebook is kept these days in a vault at the National Archives in 
Washington. Its 80-year-old pages, so delicate that only Archives employees are 
allowed to turn them, make clear that there is a problem with its most dramatic 
entry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slipped In as Entry 
</P>
<P>
One page is loose. And it has not simply fallen loose. It has been torn from 
some other section of the notebook and slipped in as part of the entry for 
April 6 -- the day, according to all school textbooks, that Peary, in one of 
the last glorious feats of the age of exploration, discovered the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
That loose page has spawned a wrenching controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Did Peary accidentally use a page out of order and then simply try to right 
things by putting it in its logical place? Or, did Peary, in the excruciating 
joy of triumph, somehow forget to record that triumph in his diary and then 
feel forced to cover up that oversight later? 
</P>
<P>
Or, did the Navy commander -- in the most terrible scenario of all -- fail to 
reach the pole at all and decide after a few anguished days to fake his 
triumph? 
</P>
<P>
The mysterious notebook is just one of a myriad of bits of evidence that Thomas 
D. Davies, a 74-year-old retired Navy admiral, and his Foundation for the 
Promotion of the Art of Navigation are sifting and weighing as they try, once 
and for all, to determine whether Peary, one of the great American heroes of 
the North, returned from that fateful, grueling, magnificent trek over the ice 
of the Arctic Ocean in 1909 with a lie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be Dostoevskian' 
</P>
<P>
If it is proven that he did lie, the evidence may show that an obsessed Peary 
proclaimed his fraudulent claim out of bursting anger over the earlier, even 
more fraudulent, claim to the North Pole by another explorer, an amiable 
charlatan now largely forgotten named Dr. Frederick Cook. Should that be so, 
says Joseph Judge, the senior associate editor of the magazine of the National 
Geographic Society that has commissioned the research, "it would be 
Dostoevskian." 
</P>
<P>
The trend is moving away from Peary. The National Geographic itself published 
an article by British explorer Wally Herbert last September that cast doubt on 
Peary's feat and guessed that he probably fell short by 30 to 50 miles. 
Canadian historian Pierre Berton, in a book published last year, concludes that 
Peary, like the knights of Camelot, "could not complete his quest." These 
conclusions rest largely on the failure of Peary to come home from the polar 
North with anything more than a few rudimentary navigational jottings to 
confirm his feat. 
</P>
<P>
The critics infuriate the Peary family. 
</P>
<P>
"Peary had been exploring the Arctic for 20 years," said retired Naval Cmdr. 
Edwin Peary Stafford, the 70-year-old grandson of the explorer, at his home 
near Chesapeake Bay just outside Annapolis. "He had his own system of 
navigation. He had a system of navigation that they cannot relate to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Persistent Critic 
</P>
<P>
This argument is dismissed by Baltimore astronomer Dennis Rawlins, probably the 
most persistent critic of Peary in the last 15 years. "Peary was a courageous 
man," said the 51-year-old Rawlins over dinner at the Baltimore Museum of Art 
recently. "He almost died in the Arctic. He deserved to become a famous man, a 
rich man. But in science you have to present evidence for your claim." Rawlins 
believes Peary was forced to turn back more than 100 miles short of his goal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Ramifications 
</P>
<P>
There is more at stake than Peary's reputation. Matthew Henson, an assistant, 
trekked throughout the polar regions on every Peary expedition. He and four 
Eskimos traveled as far north as Peary on that final trip. The coffin of Henson 
was transferred to a plot next to that of Peary in Arlington National Cemetery 
only last April. An elaborate monument there now honors Henson as a 
"co-discoverer of North Pole." But, if Peary did not make it to the pole, 
neither did Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what makes it so hard to prove whether Peary -- or anyone else -- has 
in fact been to the pole is the nature of the North Pole itself. Reaching it 
was one of the last great prizes of the romantic Victorian age of exploration, 
a time when newspapers and their readers were excited by the tales of men and 
women trekking through the fevers and fears of darkest Africa to find the 
source of the Nile or the Mountains of the Moon. But, unlike the earlier 
geographic prizes, the pole or, as the Eskimos liked to call it, "the Big 
Nail," is not really anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
The pole is not a pole or a nail or a hill or a hole or a rock or a place. It 
is an imaginary, theoretical, mathematical point exactly on top of the Earth, 
the most northerly point in the world. But whereas the South Pole lies on solid 
land, the top of the Earth is covered by ocean -- frozen, constantly shifting 
and drifting ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Mark Location 
</P>
<P>
You know you are at the North Pole only by measuring the angle of the sun or 
the stars in the sky with scientific instruments. And in Peary's day at least, 
there was no way to mark your location so others could verify it. 
</P>
<P>
If an explorer at the North Pole carved his initials on the ice or buried a box 
of mementoes in it, this evidence of discovery would soon float far away. 
</P>
<P>
The latest flare-up of the controversy has its roots in a television movie in 
1984 that painted a villainous Peary cheating Cook of recognition as the 
discoverer of the pole. "It made me sick," said Stafford, who has an 
unmistakable resemblance to his tall, red-haired grandfather. "They had Richard 
Chamberlain, their Dr. Kildare, playing Cook, and Rod Steiger playing Peary. 
That tells you all you need to know about the program. Cook was a likable, 
affable man. But he was a liar. He lied all the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diary Released 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the program, the Peary family decided to release the diary and 
all the rest of Peary's papers to researchers, hoping this would solidify 
Peary's claim to the pole. Yet, while all reputable scholars now dismiss Cook's 
claims, the release of the papers also led to the National Geographic article 
that questioned Peary's claim. 
</P>
<P>
A greater shock came a few weeks after the Geographic article appeared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proven Wrong 
</P>
<P>
Rawlins, the Baltimore astronomer, cited a number-strewn sheet in the Peary 
papers as absolute proof that Peary knew he was far from the pole on April 6, 
1909. That, if true, stamped Peary as a knowing cheat. In the end, Rawlins was 
proven wrong about the supposedly incriminating evidence, but his accusation 
prompted the National Geographic Society to act. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the society had been looked on as the champion of Peary. It helped 
sponsor his North Pole expedition, corroborated his claim to the pole without 
checking his data closely and defended his reputation almost blindly for many 
years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it decided to sponsor a thorough and judicious investigation, calling in 
Davies and the Navigation Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
All sides seem to trust the integrity and determination of Davies, a former 
assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Aside from 
examining all the Peary papers in the Archives, he and his board are using 
satellite maps, computer programming, Arctic Ocean soundings and modern 
navigational techniques to determine whether Peary could have done what he said 
he did. They plan to announce their conclusions in July. 
</P>
<P>
There never was any doubt that Peary had claimed an astounding feat. In the 
final spurt to the pole, he, Henson and the four Eskimos -- Ooqueah, Ootha, 
Egingwah and Seegloo -- covered the final 133 miles on their dog sledges in 
five days. That was double Peary's normal speed. "I had not dared to hope for 
such progress as we were making," he wrote later. "Still the biting cold would 
have been impossible to face by anyone not fortified by an inflexible purpose." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guided by the Sun 
</P>
<P>
Peary said he achieved his great speeds on these days of 24-hour daylight by 
managing to keep on a straight line due north with almost no detours for 
openings in the ice or hillocks of snow. Although he had no time to take 
sextant readings to make sure that he had not wandered off his longitude along 
the way, Peary said he knew he was going directly north by "dead reckoning." By 
this he meant that, knowing the time of day when the sun would be due north, he 
simply used the sun as his guide. 
</P>
<P>
On April 6, Peary took enough observations with a sextant to determine that he 
was at 89 degrees, 57 minutes, 11 seconds north latitude, theoretically less 
than three miles from the North Pole. Since his eyesight and instruments had 
some margin of error, he zigzagged over 10 miles in hopes of crossing the exact 
point of the pole or close enough to count himself as its discoverer. "I had 
passed over or very near the point where north and south and east and west pass 
into one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Led Group in Cheers 
</P>
<P>
He put up the American flag and four other flags, including those of his 
Bowdoin College fraternity and the Red Cross, and then led Henson and the 
Eskimos "for three rousing cheers, which they gave with the greatest 
enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
"I had at last succeeded in placing the flag of my country at the goal of the 
world's desire," he wrote later in his account of the expedition. "It is not 
easy to write about such a thing, but I knew that we were going back to 
civilization with the last of the great adventure stories." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defies Belief, Critics Say 
</P>
<P>
In the view of critics, the adventure story is so neat that it defies belief. 
They cannot accept Peary's speeds across the ice and doubt that he could have 
rushed northward in a straight line. They have no faith in his "dead reckoning" 
and believe the drift of the ice would have taken him far off course. They 
wonder about the accuracy of his chronometers and whether he took the shifting 
position of the magnetic North Pole into account when using his compass. They 
are suspicious of his failure to obtain proper soundings of the depth of the 
Arctic Ocean as he traveled. They also say that his only data -- his sextant 
readings at the pole -- could have been faked later. 
</P>
<P>
The main critic, Rawlins, who teaches at Loyola University in Baltimore, was 
embarrassed in February when Davies, in an interim report, discredited the 
astronomer's contention that the readings on a sheet of paper in the Archives 
provided absolute proof that Peary was a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
These readings, which could not have been taken at the pole, were in an 
envelope marked by Peary's widow as containing the data for April 6, 1909. That 
would have meant Peary was elsewhere than the pole on that celebrated day. But 
Davies discovered that the widow had made a mistake; the page contained 
readings made in the Arctic three years earlier and thus proved nothing about 
the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the flare-up over this sheet of paper was no more than a diversion. Davies 
is still pursuing all the issues, including the speed of the sledges and drift 
of the ice, that Rawlins and other critics have raised. The investigation was 
supposed to be part-time work for the small, nonprofit Navigation Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
But Davies, working in an office set aside for him at the National Geographic 
Society, has become caught up in all its fascinating nooks and byways. "It is 
such an interesting detective story that it is hard to let go of it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitterness Over Cook 
</P>
<P>
It is a detective story with psychological overtones -- what Commander 
Stafford, the grandson, sneeringly calls "revisionist psychology" -- and most 
emanate from Peary's bitterness over Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Historians have not been kind to Peary's personality. "No other explorer in 
Arctic history," wrote Pierre Berton, "was ever as single-minded in the pursuit 
of his goal as Robert Edwin Peary, no other as paranoid in his suspicion and 
even hatred of those he considered rivals and interlopers, no other as 
ruthless, as arrogant, as insensitive or as self-serving." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Peary, even before the 1909 expedition, was the greatest American polar 
explorer of his time. He had led expeditions across the north of Greenland in 
1892 and 1895 and onto the Arctic ice in 1902 and 1906. He was already credited 
with reaching farther north than any other explorer. Books about him, his wife 
and his daughter, Marie, born in the North and known as the Snow Baby, were 
best-sellers. He was the hero and beneficiary of branches of the Peary Arctic 
Club throughout the United States. It was unthinkable that an upstart like Cook 
would beat him to the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Peary knew that greater prizes of immortality in history and of 
immense wealth awaited him if he reached the pole first. While sledging across 
the ice, in fact, he jotted down money-making ideas in his diary. Pieces of 
North Pole bearskin fringe for souvenirs to women ... Special Peary North Pole 
snowshoes ... Have Henson make pattern "Peary North Pole" sledges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His Last Chance 
</P>
<P>
 At age 53, crippled with all but one of his toes amputated from frostbite on 
an earlier expedition, Peary also knew he would never have another chance to 
try for the pole. And he feared that Cook, whom he believed capable of the most 
blatant lies, would try to usurp the prize that rightfully belonged to Peary. 
</P>
<P>
The fears were soon realized. When Peary finally reached a wireless station on 
land to send the world news of his claim, he found that Cook had just claimed 
the discovery of the pole a year before. 
</P>
<P>
The front page of the Los Angeles Times on Sept. 7, 1906, told the story. The 
main headline proclaimed: "I Have The Old Pole," Wires Peary. But the subheads 
made it clear that he was only the second explorer to get there and that Cook, 
the first, was being honored and feted in Copenhagen as the discoverer of the 
North Pole. "For Second Time Within a Week," the headlines said, "the World 
Learns That an American Has Attained the Goal of Centuries -- Most Remarkable 
Coincidence in History. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Peary hounded Cook and demanded proof that he could not provide. 
In a few months, Cook was exposed as a fraud. Some historians believe he never 
moved more than 13 miles off the coast of Greenland. Cook was stripped of his 
honors and fame, and the world soon hailed Peary as the true discoverer of the 
North Pole. Yet, though the National Geographic Society and a congressional 
committee endorsed the feat of Peary, no one ever demanded of Peary the same 
proof demanded of Cook. A second fraud was unthinkable.

Strange Twist 
</P>
<P>
The role of Henson adds another bewildering note to the Peary case. Henson, 10 
years younger than Peary, acted as a kind of servant to Peary and a foreman of 
Eskimos for him. There is no doubt that Henson developed Arctic skills 
remarkable enough to earn recognition as a distinguished American explorer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a rift developed between Peary and Henson on that April 6. While Henson 
believed that the anger of Peary was directed at him for daring to share 
Peary's triumph, some critics interpret the anger instead as a reflection of 
Peary's dark mood over his failure. Henson's testimony is thus often used 
against Peary. 
</P>
<P>
In an article in the Boston American in 1910, Henson described the scene: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Well, Mr. Peary,' I spoke up, cheerfully enough, 'we are now at the Pole, 
are we not?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I do not suppose that we can swear that we are exactly at the Pole,' was his 
evasive answer. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Well, I have kept track of the distance and we have made exceptional time,' 
I replied, ' . . . If we have traveled in the right direction, we are now at 
the pole. If we have not traveled in the right direction then it is your own 
fault.' 
</P>
<P>
"Commander Peary made no reply. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally I am forced to the belief that he had intended to visit the pole 
accompanied only by a couple of Eskimos leaving me a few miles short of the 
great destination and, having fooled himself in the matter of distance, and by 
an oversight permitted me to be with him at the North Pole, he was a bitterly 
disappointed man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard Feelings Still Linger 
</P>
<P>
Peary and Henson were never reconciled after that. And a hint of the rift still 
lingers in the Peary family. Although Commander Stafford attended the Arlington 
National Cemetery ceremonies honoring Henson, he said recently, in an 
interview: "I think the pendulum has swung too far. . . . If he was 
co-discoverer of the North Pole, then the lookout on the Santa Maria was 
co-discoverer of America." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the integrity of Peary has no greater supporters than the champions of 
Henson. If Peary loses his prize, their favorite loses it as well. It would be 
a bitter pill to take after so long a battle to win recognition for the 
long-neglected Henson. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an interest in Matthew Henson for some time and in seeing that he 
received proper recognition for polar exploration," said S. Allen Counter, a 
neurophysiologist at Harvard Medical School who led the campaign to bury Henson 
at Arlington cemetery. "Everything I've studied suggests to me and convinces me 
that Perry and Henson made it to the pole, or close enough." 
</P>
<P>
If the Navigation Foundation concludes that they did not reach the pole, a 
Russian scientist will probably emerge in geography textbooks as the first man 
to set foot on or very near the point that is the pole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Russians Land 
</P>
<P>
Once Peary proclaimed his conquest of the pole, other famous explorers, such as 
the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, erased the pole from their list of Arctic goals. 
In 1937, however, a plane flew a Russian expedition, led by Ivan Papanin, to 
the pole. They descended, thinking themselves the first people to reach the 
pole since Peary. Papanin and the other scientists took measurements on the 
pole and then elsewhere in the Arctic as they drifted southward on an ice floe 
for much of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But, if Peary failed, the first man to reach the pole by dog sledge -- in the 
Peary manner -- would be British explorer Wally Herbert, the author of the 
National Geographic article that disappointed the Peary family by using the 
newly released papers in the Archives to cast doubt that Peary ever made it. 
Herbert, while crossing the Arctic Ocean from Alaska to Spitsbergen, reached 
the pole on the 60th anniversary of the day that Peary claimed as his moment of 
triumph.

SCIENCE SUCCESS IN SPACE MEETS EARTHLY DISASTER

A sensitive protein crystal experiment that was rocketed into orbit aboard the 
space shuttle Discovery came to an unfortunate crash landing at the Birmingham, 
Ala., Municipal Airport, rendering the experiment worthless, it was learned 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The crash landing -- one day after Discovery's March 18 landing at Edwards Air 
Force Base -- did not occur on the Tarmac. Rather, it happened in Birmingham 
Airport's Concourse C, as it passed through the conveyor belt of the X-ray 
security machine. The problem was, it tipped over, perhaps with the help of a 
bungling security guard. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it goes in science. Experiments fail for a lot of reasons, but 
this is a new one on us," said UC Riverside biochemistry professor Alexander Mc 
Pherson. "I'm not real happy." 
</P>
<P>
Mc Pherson now is hoping to book the experiment on a future shuttle mission. 
The goal is to learn more about how protein crystals grow in a weightless 
environment -- an endeavor that may someday enable scientists to design new 
cancer-fighting medicines, Mc Pherson said. The experiment -- one of several he 
has placed on shuttle flights -- was among 60 crystal experiments that rode 
Discovery on its five-day mission last month. 
</P>
<P>
After 79 orbits and a perfect landing, everything seemed fine. Unloaded from 
Discovery, Mc Pherson's experiment was transported in its shuttle case to the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham, where the protein crystals were carefully 
unpacked and placed in glass plates. Those plates were then packed inside a 
Styrofoam ice chest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delicate Assignment 
</P>
<P>
Mc Pherson's aide on the experiment, postdoctoral fellow Stan Koszelak, was 
dispatched to Birmingham to carry the box back to UC Riverside. The 
instruction: Keep the box upright. 
</P>
<P>
But Koszelak couldn't hand carry it through the X-ray machine. X-rays 
themselves were not the concern. According to Mc Pherson, Koszelak warned 
security guards about the importance of keeping the box upright before placing 
it on the machine's conveyor belt. 
</P>
<P>
"As it was coming out the other end," Mc Pherson said, "it started to tip over 
. . . Stan let loose a scream." 
</P>
<P>
A well-meaning security guard, Mc Pherson said, ran to the box, apparently 
planning to right it. Instead, he completely upended the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Koszelak's reaction attracted police and a jetliner pilot, who happened to be 
passing by. "They all thought Stan was some sort of troublemaker," Mc Pherson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Princella King, a security worker at Birmingham Airport, recalled the incidents 
of March 19. Contacted by telephone at her work, King said she was manning the 
Concourse C X-ray machine that night and vaguely remembered "the guy who said 
he was an astronaut or a scientist or something." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Trouble 
</P>
<P>
King said the box may have gotten caught on the rubber flaps that hang at the 
exit of the machine. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't no big thing," King said. "He just picked it up and left. There 
isn't going to be any trouble, is there?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Federal Aviation Adminstration is looking into the matter, Mc 
Pherson said. On March 22, Mc Pherson said he told NASA officials and other 
crystal researchers of his troubles at a meeting in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
"They were dismayed to say the least, " he said. "NASA has stickers we could 
have put on the container that would have allowed us to carry it straight 
through without security examination. Someone never thought to do that. NASA is 
a monstrous agency and nobody knows what's what." 
</P>
<P>
Mc Pherson figures $5 worth of equipment was lost. Of course, he added, that 
does not include the thousands of dollars spent in years of research, or the 
"$1,200 to fly Stan to Birmingham."

JUDGE WON'T ORDER REAGAN TO APPEAR AT TRIAL

A federal judge refused Friday to order former President Ronald Reagan to 
testify at Oliver L. North's trial, saying "nothing . . . remotely supports" 
the defense claim that the ex-President authorized illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no showing that President Reagan's appearance is necessary to 
assure Lt. Col. North a fair trial," U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said 
in a written order. 
</P>
<P>
North lost another round a few hours later when Gesell refused to dismiss the 
charges against him. "All these counts go to the jury," the judge said after an 
hourlong hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Have Fought Order 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reagan said in Rancho Mirage, Calif., that he would have continued 
to fight any efforts to force him to appear. 
</P>
<P>
"I made up my mind I wasn't going. I think it would have set a precedent that 
the next President doesn't have a right to impose on other Presidents. No 
President has ever been subpoenaed," Reagan told KESQ-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Simon, North's attorney, argued that the 12 counts against North should 
be dropped for a variety of reasons. Among other things, Simon said North never 
intended to obstruct an investigation by former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III into 
the Iran-Contra affair after it was revealed in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for North, a former National Security Council aide, have argued 
during the six-week trial that the retired Marine was acting on Reagan's 
authority when he defied Congress by raising money and providing military 
assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In December, defense lawyers issued a subpoena to compel Reagan's appearance in 
court. But Gesell said he could find nothing to indicate that North was acting 
on Reagan's authority. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial record presently contains no proof that defendant North ever 
received any authorization from President Reagan to engage in the illegal 
conduct alleged, either directly or indirectly, orally or in writing," Gesell 
wrote. "Accordingly, the subpoena is quashed." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution rested its case Thursday after calling 29 witnesses, and the 
defense is scheduled to begin its case before the jury on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
North is accused of obstructing Congress and making false statements about 
helping the rebels in a complicated scheme that also involved selling weapons 
to Iran and diverting the profits to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Presidential Privilege 
</P>
<P>
In his five-page order, Gesell said no presidential privilege prevented him 
from ordering the former President to testify, had defense attorneys made a 
sufficient case that Reagan's appearance was essential to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Defendant has wholly failed to make this necessary showing," Gesell said. 
</P>
<P>
Had Gesell granted the defense request, Reagan, who now lives in Los Angeles, 
would have been the first former President to be compelled to testify in a 
criminal proceeding concerning his conduct while in office. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said he reviewed numerous documents and the trial record in reaching his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan cooperated with the independent counsel's investigation, which has 
uncovered "voluminous materials, classified and non-classified, running into 
hundreds of thousands of pages of White House documents," Gesell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Examined Diaries 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he had examined portions of Reagan's personal diaries as well as 
extensive written answers to questions posed by the grand jury that indicted 
North in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing there even remotely supports an authorization claim," Gesell said, 
agreeing with arguments made by Reagan's personal attorney, Theodore B. Olson. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased and the order speaks for itself," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon, North's attorney, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell agreed with Olson that authorization to lie may not be a defense for 
lying. "Whether or not authorization is a defense, authorization is not 
established by atmosphere, surmise or inference." 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department had opposed Reagan's court appearance on the ground that 
it could have opened the door for questioning about sensitive national security 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell acknowledged that there is "understandable public interest" in what 
Reagan "may have known or may have done." But he said North's trial does not 
involve such a broad inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial of Lt. Col. North now concerns only his alleged criminal conduct 
identified in discrete, specific charges." Three broad conspiracy charges 
against North involving presidential matters had been dropped, Gesell noted. 
</P>
<P>
The authorization issue was raised specifically during testimony by Robert C. 
McFarlane, the former national security adviser who was North's boss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of Erroneous Claims 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, North sent letters under McFarlane's signature falsely denying that 
the National Security Council was involved in soliciting money for the Contras 
or helping them militarily. North is also accused of making the same erroneous 
claims to House Intelligence Committee members in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane testified that he told Reagan about the congressional inquiries in 
1985, pointing out that the White House would be criticized on Capitol Hill 
regardless of what answers it gave. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane said Reagan didn't tell him what to put in the letters but accepted 
McFarlane's characterization that criticism was inevitable, and said, "OK." 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress in connection 
with the letters to then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Lee H. Hamilton 
(D-Ind.) and then-Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.). McFarlane was fined $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12-count indictment, North also is accused of illegally accepting a 
$13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant Richard V. Secord, 
converting to his own use at least $4,300 in travelers checks from Contra 
leader Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue in 
connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

PANEL GIVES REPORT ON COMPUTER PRANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rogue computer program that crippled a nationwide computer network last fall 
was neither the creation of a genius nor the act of a criminal, a commission at 
Cornell University has concluded. Cornell graduate student Robert Morris alone 
created the program that infected thousands of military and university 
computers, the panel's report said. Morris, 23, who is on a leave of absence 
from the school's doctoral program in computer science, refused to be 
interviewed by the commission, which was left to speculate as to the reasons 
Morris created the "worm," an independent program that endlessly duplicates 
itself once placed in a computer system -- as opposed to a "virus," which 
inserts itself into a host program to propagate. The commission found that 
Morris probably wanted to spread the "worm" without detection but that, once it 
had been unleashed, he made only "minimal efforts" to stop its spread.

Word that she would receive several hundred thousand dollars in compensation 
for the May, 1987, death of her son in the missile attack on the guided missile 
frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf made Pat Stevens of Visalia cry for sorrow 
and say she would "rather be a bag lady and have Jimmy back." The money is 
payment from the Iraqi government for the death of her son, Petty Officer 2nd 
Class Jimmy Stevens. "I hate that money," Stevens said. "It's just that this 
brings up all kinds of feelings. I feel guilty, frustrated. And I feel despair. 
I'd rather be a bag lady and have Jimmy back." Under the settlement between the 
United States and Iraq, $27.3 million will be dispersed among 37 families that 
lost men in the attack. Stevens said she and her husband, Bob, will set up a 
scholarship in their son's name at Mt. Whitney High School, where he graduated. 
They will also make a donation to St. Mary's Catholic Church, where he was an 
altar boy.

A report containing final results of tests on drinking water at USA Today 
offices in Arlington, Va., says average levels of lead are 3 1/2 times the 
federal guidelines and the likely source of the contamination is lead solder 
used on plumbing fixtures in the two buildings, the Washington Post reported. 
Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Gannett Co., which owns the national 
newspaper, said the buildings' owners have begun a program that involves 
injecting sodium silicate, a nontoxic substance, into the water system. Within 
60 to 90 days, the chemical gives the pipes and solder joints a protective 
coating that prevents leaching of lead into the water. The tests were conducted 
after employees became concerned over an unusually high number of miscarriages 
among women in the newsroom.

Canada and France settled a decade-old dispute involving fishing rights in the 
seas around the French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, which lie just 15 
miles southwest of Newfoundland. Under the agreement, French fishermen will 
have an annual quota of more then 42,000 tons of fish in the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence and the banks off the islands over three years. The two nations also 
agreed to send a dispute over boundaries in the region to binding arbitration 
by a five-member international panel. The dispute began in 1977 when Canada 
proclaimed an economic zone of 200 miles and France responded by declaring an 
identical zone around the islands.

PURGE ORDERED IN KOSOVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Communist leaders in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo ordered a major purge of 
officials blamed for widespread rioting by ethnic Albanians there. The decision 
by the party's Central Committee to fire officials in institutions ranging from 
Parliament to trade unions came after the worst violence that Yugoslavia has 
seen since the Balkan federation was created in 1948. Official figures put the 
death toll at 24 in a week of street battles and shooting. All the protests 
opposed attempts by Serbia, Yugoslavia's biggest republic, to curb the powers 
of Kosovo, an autonomous province within the republic. Ethnic Albanians make up 
about 90% of Kosovo's population.

About 6,500 Savannah River Plant workers got $80 million in severance and 
vacation pay as E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. handed over operation of the 
nuclear weapons plant to Westinghouse Electric Corp. Du Pont, which built the 
plant near the Georgia border at Aiken, S.C., and managed it for the government 
for 38 years, announced last October it was not renewing its contract with the 
Department of Energy amid continuing reports of safety problems. Du Pont issued 
the checks Thursday and Friday, even though most employees will stay on. About 
1,200 workers decided to retire. The Savannah River Plant is the nation's only 
manufacturer of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to make nuclear 
weapons at other government defense plants. Its three reactors have been idled 
for nearly a year because of safety and structural problems.

Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa appealed to Sinhalese militants and 
Tamil rebels to negotiate an end to six years of ethnic violence and said 
Indian troops will be sent home. Premadasa, in a speech broadcast over 
state-run radio, promised to scrap the controversial India-Sri Lanka peace 
accord in which 40,000 Indian soldiers have been sent to the island nation to 
put down the rebellion by Tamil separatists. Premadasa also offered radicals 
seats in Parliament and promised to do away with strict anti-terrorism laws. 
There was no immediate comment from either the Tamil rebels or the Sinhalese 
militants.

JOURNALISTS TAKE COMIC AIM AT PISTOL-PACKIN' PRESIDENT

Washington's journalistic Establishment lampooned President Bush at a white-tie 
dinner Saturday night as a "pistol-packin' poppy" whose idea of a kinder, 
gentler nation is "a cop on ev'ry corner and a gun in ev'ry hand." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle were prime targets of the 104-year-old 
Gridiron Club, whose annual dinner is one of the biggest social events in the 
capital. The main business of the evening was to spoof the President and other 
prominent figures with humor designed to "singe but never burn." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Elite Attends 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 guests included the journalists' bosses and a cross-section of 
the Washington power elite, including Supreme Court justices, Cabinet members, 
members of Congress and governors. 
</P>
<P>
The club members, portraying their victims in a series of satirical skits, 
roasted Bush, Quayle and other prominent figures, including Massachusetts Gov. 
Michael S. Dukakis, former Texas Sen. John Tower, House Speaker Jim Wright, 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, billionaire developer Donald Trump 
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
But it was First Lady Barbara Bush who made for some of the highlights of the 
evening. First, Mrs. Bush, who is frequently asked why she doesn't dye her 
white hair, showed up at the dinner in the Capital Hilton Hotel wearing a dark 
strawberry blond wig. 
</P>
<P>
A murmur went through the room as the woman whose husband calls her "the Silver 
Fox" appeared with the short wig. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chides Husband 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a prepared sketch, Mrs. Bush, played by Cheryl Arvidson of the Dallas 
Times Herald, chided her husband for his initial opposition to controls on 
semiautomatic assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Lay that Uzi down, George, lay that Uzi down," sang the on-stage Mrs. Bush. 
"Pistol-packin' poppy, lay that Uzi down." 
</P>
<P>
Later, a journalist posing as a White House speech writer sang the "Bush Battle 
Hymn" with these words: 
</P>
<P>
 Mine eyes have seen the glory of a kinder, gentler land, 
</P>
<P>
 With a cop on ev'ry corner and a gun in ev'ry hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny tots in public schools will pledge allegiance on command, 
</P>
<P>
 George Bush is in command." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Gridiron chorus sang: "Sis-boom-bah and hallelujah, Eli Yale will 
boola-boo ya. Read my lips so I can rule ya. You gotta read them right." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quayle Takes Lumps 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, played by Richard T. Cooper of The Times, took his lumps in a duet with 
former President Richard M. Nixon, portrayed by John Hall of Media General. 
</P>
<P>
To the tune of "I Believe in You," the Nixon stand-in sang: 
</P>
<P>
 You're not the dim bulb I had been led to believe I would see. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you an airhead dilettante lightweight? You sure could fool me. 
</P>
<P>
 Cause I believe in you, I believe in you. 
</P>
<P>
 I think you're perfectly qualified, 
</P>
<P>
 As the Veep, you're swell. 
</P>
<P>
 All my concerns have been mollified 
</P>
<P>
 If Bush stays well. 
</P>
<P>
 To which the chorus responds: "George, stay well." 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Wright was portrayed as bemoaning his lost pay raise and longing 
to be viewed in the same light as the late Texas Rep. Sam Rayburn -- with 
respect. To the tune of "My Buddy," he sang: "My money."

WHITE HOUSE PARTY IS THE PITS: BUSH PITCHES IN ON A COLD DAY 
</P>

<P>
Even without the unseasonably cold weather, George Bush's 150 guests Saturday 
might have been forgiven for describing their visit to the White House as The 
Pits. 
</P>
<P>
After all, that was the whole idea: The President was formally unveiling the 
new 40-foot horseshoe pit that he had had built on the South Lawn of the White 
House, and he wanted to kick it off in grand style, with a horseshoes game and 
a lawn party to boot. 
</P>
<P>
But the biting April Fool's Day wind turned the afternoon into something of a 
clunker, even for the President and world horseshoe-pitching champion Jim 
Knisley of Bremen, Ohio, neither of whom quite matched his usual performance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so embarrassing it stinks," the leader of the Western world was heard 
to say when one of his pitches missed and bounced off the backboard. On his 
second try, though, the President -- or perhaps a ringer for him -- scored 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gusty Winds 
</P>
<P>
Although the President and his wife, Barbara, both wore windbreakers, the gusty 
winds were enough to knock the socks -- or the shoes -- off a horse. There were 
no horses, but there were plenty of horseshoes -- including some gaily painted 
wooden ones used as table decorations. 
</P>
<P>
There also were some nearly frozen people -- including Democratic Michigan Gov. 
James J. Blanchard, who could not resist a dig at Bush's patrician past. "I 
think we ought to see the Bush form," Blanchard taunted. "Democrats never 
learned this game, you understand." 
</P>
<P>
Although the President is installing only one horseshoe pit, the White House 
built a second, temporary pit for what Bush described as "the overflow crowd" 
that the social staff had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Bush became interested in horseshoes while he was serving as vice president, 
when he installed a pit at his home in Kennebunkport, Me. -- ostensibly to make 
sure that his Secret Service agents had something to do. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met Knisley -- who won his second world horseshoe-pitching contest last 
August at Pleasanton, Calif. -- at the Ohio State Fair during the campaign. 
Also joining in the presidential pitch Saturday was women's champion Diane 
Lopez of Lompoc, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as they were thrown open, the horseshoe pits became the target of the 
satirical barbs of the Gridiron Club, an organization of journalists that 
happened to be throwing its annual presidential roast later Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Gridiron President Lawrence M. O'Rourke of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch asked 
good naturedly: "What previous Administration could say after 100 days that it 
had a new horseshoe pit?"

Four women who began a hunger strike March 20 to demand the return of a 
provincial church to religious use were hauled off the church steps Saturday by 
police and ambulance personnel, a human rights activist said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ogorodnikov, editor of the Bulletin and Chronicle newspaper in 
Moscow, said the four have refused even water in their fast in Ivanovo, 150 
miles northeast of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Before dawn Saturday, six carloads of police and ambulance personnel took the 
women to a local hospital after taking them from the church, where they have 
been since last month. 
</P>
<P>
The women want the church, built in 1914 and known as the Vedenskaya or Krasni 
Church, returned to religious use. Since 1938, it has housed the city archives, 
which are soon to be moved to a new building.

PERU DEVALUES CURRENCY IN BID TO BOOST EXPORTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The government on Saturday devalued Peru's currency by 16.6% in an effort to 
boost exports and reduce deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have blamed inflation -- which reached a record 1,722% last year -- 
for Peru's fiscal and trade deficits. 
</P>
<P>
The devaluation, announced in the official El Peruano newspaper, pushed the 
official exchange rate to 1,440 inti to $1, up from 1,200 to $1. 
</P>
<P>
The government uses the exchange rate to pay exporters and to finance imports 
of vital drugs and food staples. The floating free market rate, which 
registered 1,550 intis to the $1 on Saturday, is used for nearly all other 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The Economy Ministry said Saturday that March consumer prices rose 42% over 
prices in February. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect inflation to continue in the short term because of price 
increases but eventually decline as the economy stabilizes. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the government increased by an average of 20% the prices of 
gasoline and subsidized foods such as wheat, cooking oil and rice. 
</P>
<P>
By devaluing the inti, the government hopes to spur exports and reduce a 
growing trade deficit.

JUDGE FREES 3 IN EL SALVADOR RIGHT-WING KIDNAP PROBE 
</P>

<P>
A judge, citing a lack of evidence, has freed two former Salvadoran military 
officers and an industrialist jailed three years ago in a highly publicized 
probe into right-wing kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Juan Hector Larios on Friday ordered the release of former Lt. Rodolfo 
Lopez Sibrian, former Maj. Jose Alfredo Jimenez Moreno and industrialist 
Orlando Llovera Ballete. 
</P>
<P>
Larios also canceled arrest warrants for five other people, including a former 
army colonel. 
</P>
<P>
The government alleged that Llovera Ballete and Lopez Sibrian posed as 
guerrillas to capture five businessmen in exchange for about $5 million between 
1980 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The two were reported to be close friends of Roberto d'Aubuisson, founder of 
the ultra-conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena. The party's 
candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, won the March 16 presidential election and was 
officially named president-elect on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The judge declared null the acts of a military judge who in 1986 started the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Larios said that statements from witnesses on the kidnapings were not reliable 
and that there is insufficient evidence to hold the men. 
</P>
<P>
When police captured Llovera Ballete and Lopez Sibrian in March, 1986, it was 
widely viewed as the start of a case that would pit the administration of 
Christian Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte against the conservative 
sectors of the military. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Sibrian also was implicated in the 1981 murders of two American land 
advisers -- Mark David Pearlman of Seattle and Michael P. Hammer of Potomac, 
Md. -- and a Salvadoran agrarian reform official. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Lopez Sibrian, who was later dismissed from the army, were 
dropped because of lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman and Hammer were advising the government on a land reform program that 
took thousands of acres from wealthy families for peasant use. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, two former army corporals were convicted in the case. The 
U.S. government later maintained that the "intellectual authors" of the crime 
had not been brought to justice.

2 INDIAN LEADERS WILL RETURN FOR NICARAGUA VOTE

Two leaders of ethnic Indian groups opposed to Nicaragua's Sandinista regime 
will return to Managua from Honduras to take part in elections scheduled for 
February, 1990, a spokesman for the group said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Steadman Fagoth and Brooklyn Rivera head the Yatama Indian group, made up of 
Miskitos, Sumos and Ramas who fought the Sandinista government along 
Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Kendy Medina, said by telephone the two will return to Managua 
in August. He said the war against the Sandinistas had failed and that the 
Contras should take part in the political process in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
He said Fagoth and Rivera will lead a political group representing the 
Caribbean coast area but will join a national coalition to contest the 
Sandinistas in the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to form a common front, strong enough to defeat the Sandinistas in 
elections," Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 Nicaraguan Indians are presently in exile in Honduras, awaiting a 
U.N. plan to repatriate them.

IRAQIS FLOCK TO POLLS TO ELECT PARLIAMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Millions of Iraqis voted Saturday for a new 250-seat National Assembly, the 
first step in President Saddam Hussein's pledged introduction of limited 
democracy here. 
</P>
<P>
A heavy turnout was reported as the voters, buoyed by the successful conclusion 
of Iraq's eight-year war with Iran, went to the polls for the first time in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
More than 950 candidates, including 62 women, sought election. No party 
designations were listed on the ballots, but all candidates had to pass a test 
of loyalty to the regime, couched in a requirement that they contributed to the 
war effort. 
</P>
<P>
President Hussein will continue to keep an iron grip on Iraq through his Arab 
Baath Socialist Party and the ruling, 11-member Revolutionary Command Council, 
political analysts and diplomats here said. 
</P>
<P>
So strong is Hussein's control that issues were almost non-existent in 
Saturday's balloting. In the northeastern city of Sulaymaniyah, near the 
Iranian border in the Kurdish autonomous region, Tanya Ali Khadar, a telephone 
operator, said she voted for one of the women candidates "because I trust her." 
</P>
<P>
In the countryside, at least, such traditional personal loyalties appeared to 
take precedence over postwar issues. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has pledged that the National Assembly elections will be followed by a 
new constitution, providing for more political parties -- there are five now, 
including the outlawed Communist Party -- and a press law. But in the last days 
of the campaigning, no official was predicting when the constitution, which is 
being drafted by a special committee appointed by the leadership, would be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Izzat Ibrahim, vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command 
Council and head of the Election Organizing Committee, said the new 
constitution would give Parliament the right to remove Cabinet officers by a 
vote of no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said: "In a later stage the president of the republic will be elected 
by direct ballot of the people. . . . He would be responsible before the people 
instead of the Revolutionary Command Council and the regional command of the 
Arab Baath Socialist Party." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's voting was a small step in the promised democratic process, perhaps 
most important as Iraq's first peacetime balloting under Husseim. Earlier 
assemblies were elected in 1980 and 1984, after the war with Iran was under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot recall one bill introduced by ordinary members of those Parliaments," 
said one observer. "They all came from the Revolutionary Command Council or the 
Speaker of the Assembly."

MAN SOUGHT IN ABDUCTION LINKED TO BOGUS DRUG DEAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities on Saturday were seeking a Los Angeles man who they say stole a van 
containing two young girls from a Castaic gas station in a move to escape armed 
drug buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace Turner, 35, allegedly kidnaped Amanda Engholm, 4, and her sister, Jana, 
2, of Wildomar, Friday after the drug buyers discovered they had been swindled, 
said Lt. Ed Chenal of the Santa Clarita sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Turner and his accomplices themselves had been kidnaped by drug buyers who paid 
them $150,000 for what turned out to be 12 boxes of Betty Crocker pudding mix, 
Chenal said. 
</P>
<P>
The girls were found unharmed an hour later in Pasadena, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two men have been arrested in the incident. Kimmet Haggins, 29, of Altadena is 
being held in lieu of $50,000 bail in the Santa Clarita station jail on 
suspicion of offering to sell material disguised as a controlled substance. 
Mathew Norman, 56, of Oakland is being held without bail on suspicion of 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began Friday afternoon when eight men met in a parking lot at La 
Cienega and La Tijera boulevards in Los Angeles to conduct a drug deal, Chenal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, Haggins and two accomplices sold Norman and three other men the boxes 
of pudding mix, disguised with newspaper wrapping and tan tape, saying it was 
cocaine, Chenal said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman and the three other drug buyers then discovered the hoax and kidnaped 
Haggins and Turner at gunpoint, taking them in two rented cars -- a blue van 
and a beige sedan -- on the northbound Golden State Freeway, Chenal said. 
</P>
<P>
The cars stopped about 8:20 p.m. at a Unocal service station in Castaic at Lake 
Hughes Road and the Old Road to allow the kidnap victims to make a phone call 
in an attempt to retrieve the money, he said. Haggins and Turner escaped from 
their captors while pretending to make the phone call, Chenal said. 
</P>
<P>
Haggins ran into some bushes, and Turner ran across the street to a Mobil 
station, Chenal said. At least one of the four alleged kidnapers fired a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol at Turner, Chenal said. 
</P>
<P>
James Robinson, 29, of Newport Beach, who was parked at the Mobil station where 
Turner fled, was shot in the left arm, Chenal said. Robinson was treated at 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia and released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner jumped into the silver van occupied by the two Engholm girls and drove 
away as gasoline spewed from bullet holes in the pumps, Chenal said. Pasadena 
police found the abandoned van with the two girls in it about 10:45 p.m. near 
Beckham Place Restaurant on Walnut Street in Pasadena, he said. The two girls 
were returned to their parents, he said. The family could not be reached for 
comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Haggins was arrested near the gas stations after deputies found him hiding in 
the bushes, Chenal said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the four men who kidnaped Turner and Haggins drove away from the 
Unocal service station in two cars, Chenal said. Norman was arrested 25 miles 
north of the station on the Golden State Freeway when a sheriff's deputy 
identified the blue van he was driving from a description broadcast over the 
police radio. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve packages of what appeared to be cocaine were found inside the van. But 
when authorities opened the packages at the Santa Clarita station, the pudding 
mix was discovered, Chenal said.

SELECTION OF NEW BISHOP CLOAKED IN VEIL OF SECRECY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When asked to describe the type of clergyman they would like to see become the 
next bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, most local Catholics 
have no difficulty painting a detailed -- if perhaps overly lofty -- portrait 
of the successor to Bishop Leo T. Maher. 
</P>
<P>
"The answers you usually get whenever you ask that question end up being a 
cross somewhere between Lee Iacocca and St. Francis of Assisi," said Father 
Thomas Reese, a fellow at Georgetown University's Woodstock Theological Center. 
"Or, as we sometimes say, what they're looking for is Jesus with an MBA from 
Harvard." 
</P>
<P>
But, although Catholics generally have a good -- and ambitious -- notion of the 
archetypical bishop, most know little about the potential candidates themselves 
or the process by which priests are elevated to one of the highest ranks in the 
church hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as one church theologian put it bluntly: "About all most people, 
including a lot of priests, know about the process is that the appointee 
probably will be someone they know little about, if anything, and that they'll 
have had almost nothing to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
With Maher only 15 months away from the church's mandatory retirement age of 
75, Catholic leaders in this country and at the Vatican are already deeply 
involved in searching for his successor -- a process at once carefully 
structured but also steeped in mystique and secretiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time Matthias was chosen by lot to replace Judas as one of the Twelve 
Apostles, the process by which bishops . . . are selected has been an important 
and often controversial issue in the church," Reese writes in "Archbishop," a 
book on the subject to be published this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Church documents, Reese said, "describe the process in skeletal outline," and 
even those few details are partially obscured by the fact that participants are 
bound by a vow of silence about the candidates under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
That order notwithstanding, names frequently leak out in advance of 
appointments, though, as in secular politics, it often is unclear whether the 
names mentioned are those of serious contenders or are simply the result of 
pure conjecture and lobbying by a particular priest's boosters. 
</P>
<P>
Guidelines approved by the Vatican in 1972, however, combined with details that 
have emerged from past American bishop selections, provide at least a general 
overview of the process that will determine who replaces Maher as the head of 
the 460,000-member, 98-church diocese, which includes San Diego and Imperial 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pope John Paul II will name Maher's successor, the real choice, church 
leaders acknowledge, likely will be made by Archbishop Pio Laghi, the 
Washington-based apostolic delegate to the United States. The Pope's primary 
effect, Reese and others contend, lies more in setting the tone and criteria by 
which candidates are nominated and evaluated rather than direct case-by-case 
involvement in picking any of the about 300 active U. S. bishops and 
auxiliaries. 
</P>
<P>
After confidential consultation with clerical and lay leaders about a diocese's 
needs and the background of potential candidates, Laghi compiles a terna, a 
list of three finalists ranked in order of preference, to be sent to the 
Vatican. There, the list is reviewed by a 37-member Congregation for Bishops, 
which in turn forwards the recommendations to the Pope's desk for the final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, the Vatican bishop panel can reject the three names and request 
that Laghi, who is also called the "nuncio," submit a new slate, which, in 
fact, sometimes happens, albeit very infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
Most times, however, the clergyman selected comes from the initial 
recommendations submitted by the apostolic delegate, with the appointee usually 
being the No. 1 name on the list. 
</P>
<P>
"The congregation certainly can and does conduct its own investigations," said 
Father Bernard Yarrish, an aide to Laghi. "But it's always the hope that the 
congregation trusts the judgment of the nuncio, who has already done an 
exhaustive review and is actually on the scene." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little More Than Rubber Stamp 
</P>
<P>
Although Yarrish responds diplomatically to the ticklish question of where the 
decision is really made, some priests go so far as to suggest that the Vatican 
usually does little more than rubber-stamp Laghi's recommendations. The 
archbishops and cardinals who serve on the Congregation for Bishops, they say, 
recognize that his choices stem from extensive interviews with those who know 
the candidates best. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, given the magnitude of the Pope's overall duties, many priests doubt 
that he plays a pivotal role in selecting bishops, with the possible exception 
of instances where he personally knows a candidate or in the case of 
high-profile positions in large dioceses such as New York or Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Framing that issue another way, they say that, on any given day, the Pope 
certainly has more pressing matters on his mind than who will be the next 
bishop of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I think these things are pretty much a cut-and-dried deal by the time they 
reach Rome," said Msgr. Charles Dollen of Poway. 
</P>
<P>
Although church officials cringe at comparisons between the bishop-selection 
procedure and the secular political world, there are obvious similarities. 
</P>
<P>
Ideology of the candidate is at least as important -- if not more so -- in 
selecting a bishop as it is in conventional politics. And, just as occurs in 
political circles whenever there are public-office vacancies, Maher's 
approaching retirement has inspired widespread speculation and rumors, replete 
with possible names and dates, within local religious groups about his 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question much on the lips these days," remarked the Rev. Douglas Regin 
of St. Francis Church in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
In public politics, an acorn of fact can sprout an oak of hypothesis. 
Demonstrating that the maxim is equally applicable to religious politics, the 
recent comments and actions of Maher and others have been closely scrutinized 
by church leaders and the press alike for tips on where the selection process 
stands, often spawning speculative scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the diocese's planned purchase of a Kensington home for the new 
bishop has led to speculation that an appointment may be imminent. Similarly, 
the fact that both Maher and Msgr. I. Brent Eagen, the diocese's chancellor, 
now are in Rome has raised eyebrows and caused knowing nods, despite the fact 
that the visit is part of a regularly scheduled pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the public's lack of a direct elective role in the choice of 
bishops, the most notable departure from "normal" politics lies in the fact 
that bishop candidates are heavily discouraged from promoting themselves. 
Indeed, most candidates generally are unaware that they are even under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Names Crop Up 
</P>
<P>
"A candidate would not necessarily be privy to the discussions, even though his 
future is involved," said Bishop John T. Steinbock of Santa Rosa, who has been 
mentioned as a possible contender for Maher's post. (Again, in one of those 
details that some see as significant but that others dismiss as simply 
coincidental, Maher served as bishop of Santa Rosa for seven years before being 
transferred to San Diego in 1969.) 
</P>
<P>
Several other names also persistently crop up in discussions about successors 
to Maher -- among them, Auxiliary Bishop G. Patrick Ziemann of the Archdiocese 
of Los Angeles; Bishop Michael Sheehan of Lubbock, Tex.; and Msgr. Lawrence 
Purcell, who formerly served here but now is based in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Regin, however, cautions that the names mentioned usually are a combination of 
actual contenders and others whose resumes, because they are well-matched to a 
diocese's needs, make them logical possibilities -- even though they are never 
in the running. 
</P>
<P>
Although the basic procedural steps in the selection are generally known, other 
critical facets remain less clear and only vaguely understood. As a result, 
answers to a number of key questions -- precisely how potential candidates 
emerge, who is queried about their qualifications and what happens during the 
final closed-door stages in the Vatican -- hinge more on educated guesswork 
than firsthand knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The screening of bishop candidates is especially shrouded in secrecy -- 
primarily to protect individuals' reputations and to guard against the 
process's becoming overly political, according to church leaders. However, 
others suggest that some church officials' desire to keep a tight rein on the 
process, and thereby their own influence, also is a factor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Akin to Sports' Draft List 
</P>
<P>
Information about possible future bishops routinely flows from dioceses 
throughout the country to Laghi's Washington office, providing something akin 
to a sports team's draft list. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the bishop, a diocese's priest council -- called a 
Presbyteral Council in San Diego -- regularly prepares lists of priests whom 
the panel's members consider worthy of advancement. In San Diego's case, those 
names are usually forwarded to the apostolic delegate, Los Angeles Archbishop 
Roger Mahony or San Francisco Archbishop John Quinn. Quinn served here as 
auxiliary bishop in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Maher did not specifically ask the council for advice about possible successors 
in recent months, according to Father Mark Campbell, the council's former 
chairman. But, since Maher's replacement is expected to come from outside the 
diocese, that would not be unusual. 
</P>
<P>
When a vacancy is about to occur, the bishop sends a report on the diocese's 
condition, needs and the desired qualities of its leader to the apostolic 
delegate, along with the names of priests and others who could be consulted on 
the subject. An 82-page report that Maher delivered to the Vatican last year 
provides much of that basic background, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of those reports, Laghi's staff then sends questionnaires to 
religious and lay leaders inquiring about the candidates' physical, 
intellectual and spiritual characteristics -- a process that Yarrish said can 
last from six months to two years. The archbishop and bishops of the province 
where the vacancy exists, as well as the leadership of the National Conference 
of Catholic Bishops, are among those usually consulted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adherence to Orthodoxy 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping judge candidates' leadership qualities, the questionnaires also 
are intended to carefully measure their adherence to church orthodoxy -- 
particularly on sensitive questions such as women's role in the church, 
abortion, birth control and the marriage of priests. Any priest who has taken a 
liberal public position contrary to the church's stance on those litmus issues, 
church officials say, need not worry about receiving "the call" to become a 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
Another wrinkle in the search for Maher's replacement is that Maher has asked 
the Vatican to name a so-called co-adjutor -- in essence, an heir apparent who 
would share diocesan duties with Maher until he retires in July, 1990, when he 
would automatically become the diocese's leader. 
</P>
<P>
Although similar to the normal bishop-selection process, the method by which 
co-adjutors are named conceivably could give Maher a slightly stronger voice in 
selecting his replacement than he would have otherwise, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Because a co-adjutor will work for months or even years side by side with a 
bishop, rather than simply succeed an already-retired predecessor, 
decision-makers might be inclined to give at least marginally greater weight to 
the bishop's own recommendations, priests and other church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Like other bishops nearing retirement, Maher has already submitted the names of 
potential successors to Laghi's office. But, if any of those names is selected, 
only Maher and a handful of other top church officials would be in a position 
to know whether he played a key role in handpicking his successor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 4 Co-Adjutors 
</P>
<P>
However, Laghi's three finalists could just as easily differ from Maher's 
recommendations. Moreover, although there has been persistent speculation that 
a co-adjutor may be named this spring, is it not known whether Laghi has 
forwarded the matter to Rome yet, or even whether the co-adjutor request itself 
will be granted. 
</P>
<P>
There are now only four co-adjutors in this country's 189 dioceses. The rarity 
with which that particular method of succession is employed -- and the fact 
that it occurs most often in cases where the bishop has a health problem or the 
diocese is embroiled in serious controversy -- causes some to question the 
likelihood of one being appointed here. 
</P>
<P>
But if local Catholics are reduced to guessing over specific names, they 
believe that an analysis of the diocese and its needs yields a relatively 
accurate picture of the candidates' likely background. 
</P>
<P>
Their consensus portrait envisions a new bishop whose moderate-to-conservative 
theology matches San Diego's and the church's own conservatism. Given San 
Diego's proximity to the border and the large number of Latinos in the church, 
the new bishop almost certainly will be fluent in Spanish, they say. A 
background in education would be useful, they add, in a diocese that includes a 
major Catholic university -- the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Many priests, speaking of the need for a bishop who could guide the diocese 
well into the next century, believe the appointee will range in age from the 
mid-40s to his early 50s. And Maher's own low profile, combined with the 
negative publicity that the diocese has received in recent years -- highlighted 
by allegations of drug use and homosexuality among priests and murky financial 
accounting -- also might call for a more outgoing, public relations-conscious 
style that could enable the new bishop to become a greater community presence, 
they add. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contrast to Outgoing Bishop 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uncommon to find a new bishop being something of a contrast to the 
outgoing one," Reese said. "If you have someone who's a financial expert but 
people are always asking, 'Bishop who?' they'll often look for someone who's 
more outgoing." 
</P>
<P>
As Catholics have become more sophisticated about the selection of bishops -- 
"Fifty years ago, some people probably thought you got a telegram from heaven," 
Reese joked -- there have been occasional calls to make the process more public 
and democratic. 
</P>
<P>
But, even many of those who are not enthralled with the current system's 
secrecy find that option distasteful, fearing that making the process more 
public would inevitably politicize it to an unacceptable degree. 
</P>
<P>
"Could you imagine a popular priest whose parishioners mount a 'Smith for 
Bishop' campaign?" Dollen asked rhetorically. "Or could you imagine Republican 
and Democratic bishops?" He learned a valuable lesson in the pitfalls of 
popular elections, Dollen said, when bitter arguments broke out between 
parishioners seeking election to his small church's Holy Name Society. 
</P>
<P>
Reese added: "Whenever people say they'd like to elect bishops, my answer is, 
'Oh, so you're so happy with the kind of people we've got in government that 
you'd like to do things the same way in the church?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appears to Be Autocratic' 
</P>
<P>
Although Reese concedes that the existing system "appears to be an autocratic 
process . . . on paper," he argues that it nevertheless works reasonably well. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes it work as well as it does is the good faith of the participants, 
who are concerned for the good of the church and recognize the problems that 
would result from imposing a bishop at odds with his priests and people," Reese 
said. Checks and balances at various levels of the process also help guard 
against a bishop or small clique of chancery officials trying to push through 
an unpopular appointment, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Many local priests, meanwhile, say that a thorough understanding of the process 
itself is less important than satisfaction with the result. 
</P>
<P>
"What matters is getting the right person for the job, however that happens," 
Regin said. "Besides, we usually end up getting someone totally different than 
we think, anyway."

DERAILED BY MOMMY TRACK?; 
</P>
<P>
BYPASSED FOR TOP STATE COURT, BENKE SPEAKS OUT ON FAMILY AND CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Patricia Benke is sitting at her desk, below a smiling, autographed 
picture of Gov. George Deukmejian, insisting she is not washed up. It is odd 
she feels compelled to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Benke is, after all, something of a wunderkind. Ever since Deukmejian named her 
to the Municipal Court bench in mid-1983, Benke has powered through the 
judicial ranks at a dazzling pace. Today, at 39, she is the youngest member and 
only woman on the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But last month, Benke was bypassed for a seat on the California Supreme Court. 
And, although that news was a blow, the aftermath has been almost tougher to 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Not Have Moved 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started when Justice Marcus Kaufman remarked that Benke, widely 
viewed as the favorite among four candidates for the prestigious post, may well 
have lost the job because she refused to uproot her family and move to San 
Francisco, where the court is based. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office will not confirm whether Benke's unwillingness to 
relocate was, indeed, the deciding strike against her, and the justice herself 
says it's all a mystery to her. Nonetheless, the possibility that it played a 
pivotal role has created quite a stir. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Kaufman's observation provoked a rousing debate: Had Pat Benke 
been relegated to the "mommy track"? 
</P>
<P>
"After Justice Kaufman made that comment, people from all over started sending 
me articles on this mommy track thing," Benke said in a recent interview. "I 
had no idea the sensitive chord that was struck out there. It just exploded." 
</P>
<P>
The mommy track concept was outlined in January in the Harvard Business Review 
by veteran feminist Felice Schwartz, who suggested that some working mothers 
might sacrifice a degree of career advancement and compensation in exchange for 
flexible hours. The proposition has since been subject to a bitter assault by 
those who contend such a track would institutionalize unequal treatment of 
women in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
After Justice Kaufman's remark, Benke was deluged with requests for interviews, 
as well as invitations to appear on television talk shows around California. A 
few colleagues -- persuaded by all the speculation -- grumbled that it was 
"unfair." Women lawyers groups throughout the state also took an interest. 
</P>
<P>
The hubbub over Benke all but stole the spotlight from the true woman of the 
hour -- Los Angeles Appellate Court Justice Joyce Kennard, Deukmejian's choice 
to succeed retiring associate Justice John Arguelles. 
</P>
<P>
Benke, meanwhile, was beginning to feel uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
At first, she said that, if her desire to commute to the high court job had 
tipped the scales against her, then it was "an absolutely legitimate" reason. 
Although Benke stands by that statement today, the justice has come to sense 
she might have "given off the wrong signal" -- or led people to believe that 
she has in fact been mommy-tracked and it's just dandy with her. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, she hasn't and it's not. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up and said, 'Wait a minute. What's going on out there in the world. Am 
I pushing myself into a position of saying, 'Well, I'm just going to raise my 
children now and go to plays and bake blueberry muffins?' 
</P>
<P>
"That's not where I see myself at all," Benke said emphatically. "I'm 39 years 
old. I plan on being around for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Traditional Mom' 
</P>
<P>
Benke calls herself "a fairly traditional mom," and she is unswervingly 
committed to her husband, Don, and two young sons. But all the mommy track talk 
made her uneasy -- worried that "people might think I was removing myself from 
consideration for something else." 
</P>
<P>
"The way this was being portrayed, I was afraid there was this perception I had 
cut off my career," she said. "I can roll with the punches, but I'm certainly 
not ready to sit back and retire." 
</P>
<P>
As the news spread, speculation became contagious. Court watchers and 
feminists, who had tabbed Benke as the favorite because she was the only 
contender on the governor's list when he last made appointments to the court in 
1987, began offering their own, often conflicting speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the governor may have been justifiably leery of appointing another 
justice whose home base was outside the Bay Area. Arguelles, who stepped down 
after just two years on the court, said the burden of commuting and being 
separated from his family in Orange County was substantial. Both Chief Justice 
Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice David N. Eagleson travel by plane on weekends to 
their homes in Southern California, and some scholars have warned that the 
strain of such commutes coupled with the court's heavy workload could 
contribute to early "burnout." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very onerous job, and many of those who have tried commuting have 
found it does not work for them personally," said San Diego Superior Court 
Judge Judith McConnell, immediate past president of the National Assn. of Women 
Judges. "Clearly, the governor wants to appoint people who are going to stay 
there for a significant length of time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deciding Point 
</P>
<P>
Given that goal, and given the governor's knowledge that commuters have 
complained of "an unhappy marriage between work and home life," Benke's 
decision not to relocate "may have been the telling mark against her," 
McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
"None of my contacts with the governor's office have indicated he's prejudiced 
against mothers," McConnell said. "I'm unwilling to say there was a double 
standard at work. I haven't seen it in other appointments." 
</P>
<P>
Others have reacted angrily to the suggestion that Benke's desire to stay in 
San Diego might have stacked the odds against her. 
</P>
<P>
The president of California Women Lawyers, Los Angeles attorney Janice 
Kamenir-Reznik, said it would be "an inappropriate sort of invasion into 
someone's personal life to mandate how close they live to their job if they are 
in fact qualified for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"The only question is, can they be at work and are they capable of conducting 
the work they need to conduct," Kamenir-Reznik said. "That's the only thing 
relevant, not the age of the children, or how supportive her husband and baby 
sitter are." 
</P>
<P>
Kamenir-Reznik stressed that she has no evidence other than "scuttlebutt" to 
suggest that the governor chose Kennard because she was willing to move to San 
Francisco and Benke was not. And she lauded Kennard, 47, as "an excellent 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the suggestion that the commute factor was decisive stirred 
considerable debate in feminist legal circles. Many argued that, if Lucas and 
Eagleson live outside the Bay Area and make long treks to work, then Benke also 
could have pulled it off. 
</P>
<P>
"People are talking a lot about it," Kamenir-Reznik said. "It's been a hot 
topic coming as it did on the heels of that mommy track article." 
</P>
<P>
After learning that Deukmejian had passed her over in favor of Kennard, Benke 
spent a while pondering the episode alone in the quiet of her sixth-floor 
chambers, surrounded by family pictures and colorful artwork contributed by her 
two boys, Michael, 7, and Pete, 5. The mood was contemplative, laden with 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was interesting because, the first time through, I was a long shot . . . 
and this time there was this expectation out there," Benke said. "I had to find 
a way emotionally to let go of it, to get rid of the trappings." 
</P>
<P>
It took a few days. There was a leisurely fishing trip with her son, lots of 
second guessing, a ton of "what ifs." 
</P>
<P>
Would the job have been hers if she had persuaded her husband, Don, a 
production supervisor at KPBS, to abandon their sprawling, custom-built home 
near San Diego State University for a new life in the Bay Area? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Benke said, "I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Was it wrong to tell the governor's office that, if appointed, she would be 
reluctant to spend more than three days a week away from her family? 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had to be honest," Benke said. "If I were a different person, I could 
say, 'No problem. I'll leave my kids with the housekeeper.' But that's not me. 
There are people out there who probably can't understand that, because they 
would give all the fingers on their left hand and right for the opportunity to 
go for it, to say this is what I want and everything around me will adjust. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Did that place her at a competitive disadvantage from the get-go? 
</P>
<P>
No one said it was a liability, "but I think I knew from the beginning it was," 
Benke said. "If you've got somebody who says, 'My bags are packed and if the 
call comes, I'm gone. I'll give 110%.' And you've got another person who says, 
'I'd love the job. I'll do my best. But I need to tell you, this is my 
limitation.' 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do? Your highest priority has to be what's good for the court." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's one other possibility to confront: "Maybe they just liked 
Joyce better than me?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the angst of the moment, Benke is upbeat about her career, her life. It 
is time, she said, to "really dig in here and concentrate," to develop a 
writing style and a judicial philosophy, to make a mark on the Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Benke acknowledges that she still has her eye on a state Supreme Court job, 
which she calls "an incredible opportunity" and something that "someone who 
loves the law just doesn't pass up." 
</P>
<P>
"Will it happen? Maybe someday. I don't know. It's one of those things that 
really is in the laps of the gods." 
</P>

FARCICAL FOLLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the world reeling from sociological disorder, San Diego's smiling 
monsignor, Brent Eagen, takes time to play indulgent papa to a naughty 
sportsman's farcical fleshly follies ("Going to Bat for Garvey," March 15). 
What a marvelous example for us all! 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Garvey indicates he is still planning a political career, and it seems the 
right reverend monsignor might be asked not only to be on the stage by the 
rostrum when the Garv makes his pitch to the voters, but also to lend a 
paternal hand in obtaining the wanted annulment. Isn't it real nice to know 
someone who has pull with Leo Maher's chancery so that the monsignor's Mission 
parish can be the venue for wedding number two? Isn't it ennobling to see this 
"aw shucks" attitude toward these tawdry shenanigans? 
</P>
<P>
And the church wonders why the hemorrhaging of its members continues.

PROTECT THE CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheep's Canyon in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park has been a remarkable oasis of 
trees, flowers, small wildlife, enchanting pools and waterfalls (not to mention 
the sheep and the endangered vireos). The Sheep's Canyon that we saw recently 
is a battered and bruised version of its former self: littered, trampled, 
struggling to stay alive, but probably dying. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Our State Park service has built a road and opened up 
Coyote/Sheep's Canyon area to four-wheel drive vehicles under virtually no 
supervision. This brings in droves of careless, littering marauders to whom the 
word "wilderness" probably means a type of RV. (Apparently these drivers are so 
feeble they cannot manage to walk a few miles to get to the canyon.) 
</P>
<P>
The canyon simply will not survive the number of visitors it now gets. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, state Senate bill 603 would allow unlicensed vehicles in 
the Anza-Borrego Park. 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone really think that people who drive dune buggies and dirt bikes are 
going to stay on the road? These people have hundreds of acres of desert that 
they've already destroyed available for their use. Once driven on, the desert 
vegetation takes centuries to recover, if it ever does. Why give them the 
small, beautiful portion that is left? 
</P>
<P>
It is a literal crime against nature to turn a hiker's paradise into a 
four-wheel drive playground. 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone want to see dunes rather than vistas of flowers and delicate 
plants? Why trample the fragile vegetation of the canyons and cause further 
impurities in the once-pristine streams? Why not save even a small area of 
beauty for our children? 
</P>
<P>
The most important question is: What kind of government officials, given the 
responsibility of protecting a park, would expose it to the danger of becoming 
a sandy parking lot? Certainly not the ones I want in office.

'ALL ABOARD' SOUNDS FOR FREE CHILDREN'S TRAIN RIDES IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The children lined the railroad tracks, waving and shouting as the scale-model 
steam train came around the bend and sounded its whistle. 
</P>
<P>
"All aboard," shouted the engineer when the train reached the cheering 
children. They scurried to find a seat, and when they were ready, the train 
started up with a puff of white steam and shouts from the smiling children. 
</P>
<P>
That was the scene last month at Charles Wilson Park in Torrance when the 
Lomita-based Southern California Live Steamers club offered free rides to 
nearly 400 children aboard the four 18-inch-high scale model trains the club 
brought to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Club members and Torrance city officials hope the enthusiasm is repeated this 
Sunday and that it cements a tradition on the first Sunday of every month when 
the trains will run along the 1,000-foot track at the eastern end of the park. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to educate youngsters about the impact of the railroads on the 
growth of the South Bay, said club members and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get the younger generation interested in trains," said Wolfgang 
Fengler, president of the 50-member miniature train club. "Because if we die, 
the interest dies with us." 
</P>
<P>
The trains are working scale models of old steam trains, which can carry about 
20 children while running at speeds of 10 to 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The club had offered the free train rides on the Charles Wilson Park tracks 
before, but only on holidays or other special occasions. The tracks were laid 
in October, 1987, with 9,000 ties donated by Watt Investment Properties and 
track from Reynolds Metal Co., said Fengler. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this weekend, the rides will be offered from noon to 4 p.m. on some 
holidays, but always on the first Sunday of the month. 
</P>
<P>
State officials last month gave approval to run the trains regularly in the 
park, which the state gave to the city, said city Parks and Recreation Director 
Gene Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
But even before the state gave final approval, Fengler, his 15-year-old son, 
Wolfgang Allen, and other members of the miniature train club spent several 
weekends pulling weeds and cleaning up trash around the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to straighten things up a bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The club members -- many are retired residents of the area -- raise donations 
to pay for the coal-based fuel used to power the steam engines. The city 
contributed the land. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the club are considering restoring a red antique caboose, which they 
would convert into a classroom or exhibit hall to teach children about 
railroads, Fengler said. 
</P>
<P>
The club has discussed adding a replica of the historic Torrance overpass as 
well as a miniature train depot. Fengler, a retired Torrance firefighter, said 
he does not know what it would cost for the entire project, which he would like 
to complete in three years. He hopes much of the money will come from donations 
and volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
He would like someday to extend the tracks to include a half-mile spur along 
the southern side of the park. 
</P>
<P>
"For now we'll just kind of take it a step at a time," he said.

5 COMPETE FOR VACANT INGLEWOOD COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The allure of a vacant seat has drawn five candidates into the race to replace 
the late Ann Wilk on the Inglewood City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Wilk, a former school board member, died of a heart attack last December, 1 1/2 
years after she surprised two-term incumbent Bruce Smith by beating him in a 
close runoff election in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of Tuesday's election will fill the remaining two years of Wilk's 
term representing the 3rd District, which encompasses Inglewood's downtown and 
west side. The candidates are: 
</P>
<P>
* Smith, a 69-year-old businessman. 
</P>
<P>
* Jose Fernandez, 29, an aide to state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk). 
</P>
<P>
* Claude Lataillade, 37, a TRW engineer who ran unsuccessfully for the seat in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
* Muhammad Nassardeen, 36, the former security director at Centinela Hospital 
Medical Center and owner of a consulting firm that works to strengthen 
black-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert Sturms, an 18-year-old student at Inglewood High School. 
</P>
<P>
As several candidates have pointed out, the 3rd District is perhaps the most 
diverse of the city's four council districts. It has a large though largely 
politically dormant Latino population, a concentration of longtime white 
residents and a substantial black population. 
</P>
<P>
That diversity is one of the reasons the race appears close. A June runoff 
among the top two finishers will be required if no candidate gets more than 50% 
of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Although campaign disclosure records show Smith with a fund-raising lead, 
Lataillade, Nassardeen and Fernandez are all potentially strong candidates. 
Nassardeen and Lataillade are black, Fernandez is Latino and Smith is white, 
but the candidates are seeking support across the ethnic spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is styling himself a near-incumbent, arguing that his experience makes 
him the strongest candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, on the other hand, has been endorsed by the family and several close 
friends of Wilk, who capitalized on dissatisfaction with Smith to earn her 
underdog victory in 1987. And Nassardeen and Lataillade are assiduously 
pursuing that perceived anti-Smith vote. 
</P>
<P>
Many district voters are senior citizens, either homeowners or residents of 
several housing complexes for seniors, and candidates are courting them: 
</P>
<P>
Lataillade's campaign literature features him shaking hands with supporter Amal 
Alexander, president of the Senior Citizens Association of the Inglewood 
Meadows housing complex near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's literature includes a handwritten letter from his grandmother 
urging votes for her grandson. 
</P>
<P>
Nassardeen proposes programs in which Inglewood youth would assist seniors and 
seniors would work as teachers aides. 
</P>
<P>
Smith emphasizes his longtime involvement in organizations such as the 
Centinela Valley YMCA and the Centinela Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
As of last week's campaign spending disclosure deadline, Smith had raised 
$13,116; Lataillade, $8,255; Nassardeen, $6,850, and Fernandez, $3,360. Sturms 
filed a short form indicating he intended to raise less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has not proposed many specific initiatives, focusing instead on his two 
council terms and the need to put a qualified representative in place quickly 
to work on issues such as crime and improving the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
"We need experience and stability on that council," Smith said. "This is a 
wonderful town and it's going to stay that way. This is the city of tomorrow. 
We have to collectively get together and change the image." 
</P>
<P>
Smith called for rejuvenating the district's block clubs and involving young 
residents by establishing sports leagues among the clubs as an alternative to 
gangs. In addition, Smith said his opponents are looking to launch their 
political careers and said he has no such ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Politician' 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself as an elected official, not a politician," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Smith plays up his experience, the other candidates say he was voted out 
because he was an unresponsive councilman. They say he lacks their vision for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
Lataillade, who backed Smith in 1987 after failing to make the runoff, said he 
will be more sensitive than Smith to the district's diverse population and 
dealing with constituents' requests for help. 
</P>
<P>
Lataillade is active in area Republican politics and has worked for several 
years organizing science fairs in the Inglewood schools. 
</P>
<P>
Lataillade said he supports increased anti-gang and anti-drug programs and 
cites his volunteer youth counseling and his co-founding of a drug 
rehabilitation center, Living Miracle Ranch. At the same time, Lataillade 
favors prosecution of parents who profit from their children's gang activity 
and mandatory sentencing for gang-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
To rejuvenate downtown Inglewood, Lataillade said he wants to stop the 
proliferation of swap meets and discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to attract the kind of businesses that can make Inglewood a major 
cultural center," said Lataillade, who cited his management experience at TRW. 
"I have the skills necessary to work with the kind of retail problems that 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
Nassardeen also has an economic agenda. He wants to attract a Nordstrom 
department store to downtown Inglewood as part of an aggressive effort to 
revamp the city's economy and its image. 
</P>
<P>
Although Inglewood has lost several department stores over the last few years, 
Nassardeen said it is possible to lure the upscale retailer. "It's not a pipe 
dream," he said. "I don't think we have to accept a substandard Inglewood. 
Inglewood needs an attitude adjustment." 
</P>
<P>
Nassardeen left his post as director of security at Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center last year to establish his own consulting business, Recycling Black 
Dollars. The firm works to strengthen black businesses by bringing them 
together, creating support networks and rotating capital within the black 
business community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobs for Young People 
</P>
<P>
Along with black economic self-reliance, Nassardeen emphasized his experience 
in anti-crime and disaster-preparedness efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But he has also made a point of reaching out to longtime residents of his 
district. For example, he said his proposal to hire Inglewood youth to assist 
seniors would aid the elderly and create jobs for young people. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very diverse community," he said. "We need to come together." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, meanwhile, speaks of his desire to make Inglewood "a model 
multi-ethnic community." 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Fernandez would be the first Latino councilman in a city with a 30% 
Latino population. The district has not had high Latino voter turnout, but 
Fernandez's supporters, many of whom worked closely with Wilk, say he is 
striving to find and attract registered Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez emphasizes his government experience with state Sen. Green, and the 
fact that he is a homeowner and self-employed businessman at age 29. He 
proposes police foot patrols downtown and allocating city revenue from the 
county transportation tax to expand the "I-Line Shuttle," a downtown shuttle 
used by seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez styles himself a good-government candidate, alluding to past council 
controversies, including a refuse contract awarded to Western Waste Industries 
without competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the City Council to conduct the public's business in an open, honest, 
ethical manner," he said. "Public contracts should be awarded by public bidding 
. . . citizens should be treated courteously. . . . Unfortunately, the 
publicity created by some infractions of these principles has created an 
unfavorable reputation for Inglewood." 
</P>
<P>
As for Sturms, his youth and lack of funds and political experience make him a 
decided long shot. But the Inglewood High School senior and Red Cross volunteer 
appeared at a candidates forum last month and gamely sought support, saying "I 
am young. I am in touch with that youth section of the district."

INDEPENDENT CARSON YOUTH HONORED FOR HARD WORK, GOOD DEEDS

<BYLINE>

<P>
Randy Leiker is busy. 
</P>
<P>
He's on the phone, trying to arrange his schedule to squeeze in two meetings 
that fall at the same time on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
This is not unusual for him; at age 18, Randy Leiker has been juggling 
responsibilities for years. 
</P>
<P>
A senior at Banning High School in Wilmington, Leiker maintains a 3.5 grade 
average. Last year he was co-editor of the Banning newspaper. This year he puts 
his energies into a peer counseling program that he helped establish at 
Banning. The peer counselors -- Leiker is one of 14 -- guide other young people 
who are having trouble in school. And in a separate program, he also counsels 
students who are college bound. 
</P>
<P>
He has done all of this while living on his own, supporting himself by working 
after school as a sales representative at the Target store in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
And he has done so in obscurity until recently, when he was brought to the 
attention of the Horatio Alger Assn., a national nonprofit group that honors 
those who have achieved success through hard work. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the association selected Banning High School as one of 30 schools 
across the country whose students would be eligible to compete for a $5,000 
college scholarship. Leiker won. He was honored at an awards ceremony last 
month. He plans to go to Cal State San Diego in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a perfect example of a young kid who said if anybody's going to do it, 
I'm going to have to do it myself," said Banning Principal Augustine Herrera 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Said Patricia Brown, director of Educational Development for the Horatio Alger 
Assn.: "We're looking for someone who's overcome adversity in life." 
</P>
<P>
Leiker himself is far more matter-of-fact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learning to Cope 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten used to my situation," he said Thursday at Banning's college 
counseling center. He adds that no matter how serious the problem -- whether 
it's a grade on an English test or being on your own at age 16 -- "90% of the 
battle is just coping with your situation." 
</P>
<P>
Leiker's situation is this: His father and mother split up when he was a baby. 
Neither could care for him. For the first 10 years of his life, he lived in 
various places, moving from Southern California to Texas to Tennessee to 
Mexico, living with various friends and relatives, including a grandmother he 
admires greatly. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when he was 10, his mother took custody of him and moved to Carson. Six 
years later, she and her husband moved to the Palmdale area. 
</P>
<P>
Randy told them he would not go. He had only two more years of high school, and 
for the first time in his life, he had stayed in one place long enough to make 
some friends. He told his mother and stepfather he would fight them in court 
rather than move. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother, at first, she was opposed to it, really opposed to it. But I told 
her that I had spent most of my life on my own anyway . . . By 10 years old, I 
could cook for myself. I knew how to clean and I could iron." 
</P>
<P>
Leiker lived with an uncle for a time, then shared an apartment in Long Beach. 
Last week he moved back to Carson, where he boards at the home of some friends. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Leiker agree that his maturity is startling, that he hungers for 
success and that he is adept at mediating disputes and helping others solve 
their problems. He exudes an inner peace, a sense of calm that many adults 
never achieve. 
</P>
<P>
He attributes this in part to his grandmother, who taught him to "think things 
through in a calm, rational manner." He also credits the National Conference of 
Christians and Jews, whose workshops he attended at youth leadership camp. He 
spent time discovering who he is and what he believes. 
</P>
<P>
He says he finds it difficult to trust people and is not big on showing 
emotion. Part of him says he should work harder at developing ties to his 
family, and yet he hasn't done it. Sometimes, he said, he is "sarcastic to the 
point where it makes you want to get rid of me." He acknowledges that he has 
demonstrated the qualities valued by the Horatio Alger Assn. -- "not by choice, 
but by circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
He describes himself as a conservative person with liberal beliefs. He thinks 
the creation story is myth. "I believe in the idea of gaseous matter being 
condensed by starlight." But he does believe in God. "I figure that somebody 
had to start this whole process." A Catholic, he says he finds the church 
oppressive, yet he wears a gold cross around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nickname: 'Mastermind' 
</P>
<P>
"Randy is remarkably mature and insightful about life itself," said Glen 
Poling, programs director for the local branch of the Conference of Christians 
and Jews. "For some reason, Randy seems like he's an older person in a young 
person's body." 
</P>
<P>
Said Banning's dean of students, Barbara Evans, who established the peer 
counseling program with Leiker: ". . .I gave him the nickname 'Mastermind.' He 
hated that nickname, but I think more and more he thinks about it, and it has 
made an impression on his life. He has accepted more and more the fact that he 
is a mastermind." 
</P>
<P>
For a teen-ager, however, this can be a heavy burden to bear. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids do feel intimidated by him," says Leiker's girlfriend, Ana 
Hernandez, also a Banning senior. "He's gotten used to that. He's a very mature 
person, and kids do look up to him." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez credits Leiker with encouraging her to apply to college -- she will 
attend Cal State Long Beach in the fall -- even when her own parents were 
pressing her to stay home and get a job. She said she knows that Leiker has had 
a difficult life and she wishes he would spend as much time on himself as he 
does on others. 
</P>
<P>
Leiker, meanwhile, seems not to want to dwell on his past. He said he has 
survived "by not thinking of everything at once. I just try to deal with one 
thing at a time."

VETERANS READY TO DEAL TO SAVE MEETING PLACE

<P>
American Legion Post No. 253 wants to give away a nice little chunk of Beverly 
Hills real estate. 
</P>
<P>
There's a catch, of course. The Legion wants to hold on to a meeting room in 
any new building that would go up on the parcel, currently the site of its 
Robertson Boulevard meeting hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to sell it and meet in a restaurant for the rest of our lives," 
said Gene Wallace, commander of the 309-member post, which has been meeting in 
its mustard-yellow hall since 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Dietrich sang there for servicemen during World War II and impromptu 
appearances by Red Skelton drew crowds in the postwar years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Roof Needed 
</P>
<P>
But time has been hard on the bunker-like building, despite its nine-inch-thick 
walls of reinforced concrete. And the prospect of finding $50,000 to pay for a 
new roof was unnerving for the post's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something of a catastrophic proposition that we can't even begin to pay 
for," said Wallace, a would-be theatrical producer who got involved in the 
Beverly Hills Legion when he built an equity-waiver theater in the space once 
occupied by its back barroom. 
</P>
<P>
The Legion doesn't serve drinks anymore. And Wallace, a Vietnam-era veteran, 
has been neglecting the theater in his preoccupation with the fate of the 
Legion post and its precious legacy, a 6,500-square-foot plot of land purchased 
from the city of Beverly Hills for $10 in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
"All we've got right now is this building. Let's have them bulldoze this place, 
give us our hall back on the ground floor, and whoever comes in can have the 
very expensive and lucrative office space that people in that area are killing 
for," he said. "And if everything worked out the right way, everybody 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
But there have been no takers, despite the prospect of saving about $1 million 
in real estate costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been presenting it to different developers since the end of last year but 
. . . that's not the greatest investment, because the Legion wants to keep the 
ground floor," said Cesar L. Marquez, an agent for Brown &amp; Brown, an equity 
development firm that represents the Legion post. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey Caroll, a partner in the Beverly Hills Medical Plaza, which is about to 
open next door, said her associates made an offer for the property three years 
ago, but the Legion was not interested in selling. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point it's a little late for us. I don't know what we'd do with it at 
this point," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marquez said he is trying to arrange for a joint venture that would demolish 
the meeting hall, erect a new building and lease meeting space back to the old 
soldiers in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
But a developer would have to pay off an existing $40,000 loan and help the 
Legion get by financially during construction without its income from rentals 
of the run-down hall for shows, dance classes and traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
More daunting still are zoning regulations and parking requirements that would 
complicate a construction job and leave a limited amount of rental space. 
</P>
<P>
City rules limit new buildings on Robertson Boulevard to three stories or 45 
feet in height. There would also have to be two floors of underground parking. 
</P>
<P>
But the Legion is willing to negotiate, and a farsighted investor can probably 
look forward to the eventual demise of the veterans group, whose members must 
have served during wartime. Unless the United States fights another war, the 
Legionnaires most likely will be gone by the year 2050. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, there are enough wartime veterans around that the Legion 
hopes to boost its membership nationwide from about 2.5 million to 3 million, 
according to Al Krank, department service officer for the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
Although it still boasts of carrying a 94-year-old World War I vet on its 
membership rolls, the Beverly Hills post is largely made up of World War II GIs 
and a smaller group who wore the uniform during the Korean and Vietnam 
conflicts, said Ruth Lange, a previous commander who now serves as adjutant. A 
World War II Coast Guard veteran, she also is the commander of the Legion's 
24th District, which includes several posts across the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"During the war years, the stars used to come there and entertain. We had 
dinners every Sunday for the servicemen, and it was an extremely active post," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there was an indifferent administration, and they just let the place run 
down, but when I put the Vietnam boys in, they really took over. They started 
cleaning up and fixing it up." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Wallace's equity waiver theater, which he paid for with his own 
money, the post has put in new wiring, refurbished an upstairs room into a 
dance studio and installed a new neon sign on its facade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rentals Boosted Income 
</P>
<P>
Rentals have boosted income from the building from $7,000 a year in the early 
1980s to about $50,000 a year now, but increasing costs for insurance and other 
obligations left the post with no funds for a new roof, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Legion was organized by World War I servicemen in France 70 years 
ago. The organization lobbies for veterans' rights and sponsors youth 
activities, such as American Legion baseball, the Boys State civics program, 
and a nationwide oratorical contest. 
</P>
<P>
Members also visit patients at Veterans Administration hospitals and sponsor 
Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.

SECRET OF GEORGETOWN'S SUCCESS WELL-KEPT

<P>
Just because Georgetown lost a basketball game and won't be playing in Seattle 
doesn't mean the mystique is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Coach John Thompson said, "I get suspicious of people who keep 
saying I do things right." 
</P>
<P>
But he must be doing some important things right because we don't hear of 
things going on at Georgetown that go on at Kentucky or Oklahoma. In times such 
as these the logical assumption is that if a school is hiding something, it 
must have something to hide. Georgetown people keep too much of the good stuff 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
They should be an example for college sports. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things you keep for yourself," said Ralph Dalton, who served as 
guide through a conversational tour of basketball life at Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton, 27, was in the same recruiting class as Patrick Ewing, tore up his knee 
before the first game and stayed on as Ewing's backup. He got an MBA degree and 
currently sells federal bonds on Wall Street. He was a student-athlete, which 
is only what they all should be. 
</P>
<P>
But when Dalton, 6-10, goes to work he meets immediate suspicions that the term 
student-athlete was a contradiction in terms. "People ask me," he said, " 'What 
is Georgetown like? Are you dumb? Are the people you associated with dumb?' " 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Georgetown players are qualified to attend a very good school, and 
they actually go to school; we're told they have a high graduation rate. At a 
time when athletes often can't speak the language, Georgetown players are 
seldom heard because of barriers the program establishes. 
</P>
<P>
The program says it's nobody's business what players' major studies are. 
Players' ages are state secrets. Players are discouraged from speaking of 
anything other than the game. Mary Fenlon, the assistant coach in charge of 
academics, flees from interviewers. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson concedes that the press is obligated to play watchdog for college 
sports, but then he pulls his own curtain down protectively. Dalton will lift 
just the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"Georgetown doesn't protect you," he said. "It gives you the opportunity to do 
things you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
And where is the joy of competition and of being 20-year-olds, the joy that 
shows they're college students and not merely Hessians? 
</P>
<P>
"I was a college kid having college fun, having the same experience on campus 
everyone else did," Dalton said. "It was complemented by the success of the 
basketball program. I didn't say basketball was complemented by school 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys show athletes spend more time practicing than studying, but then 
few college students spend all their free time studying. 
</P>
<P>
Fenlon's greatest function may be in helping freshmen learn to manage time, to 
be able to have the social life that's essential to growth. "Our school 
requirements were the same for athletes," Dalton said. "It's not easy. It's 
manageable; it's not impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Questions were raised when Georgetown won the championship in Seattle in 1984 
and Michael Graham and Reggie Williams couldn't speak a coherent English 
sentence in a post-game TV interview. It embarrassed Georgetown students -- 
past and present. 
</P>
<P>
"We watched that interview," Dalton said. "I think it was the excitement. 
Reggie actually was a good speaker." Graham, however, was at Georgetown on a 
high school equivalency diploma and was gone the next year. He is the smudge on 
Thompson's recruiting record. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton thinks it's a blessing not to be interviewed in depth -- especially 
after a game. "The worst thing is worrying about what you said on TV," Dalton 
said. "The wonderful thing about the system is that it keeps you from being 
concerned with that." 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown does not have special dorms for athletes. "It was wonderful being 
part of the ordinary student population," Dalton said. That was the priority. 
Priority doesn't include being observed having fun. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown's public face is as gray as its uniforms. "We do some things that we 
don't share with you all," Thompson said when the Big East championship was 
won. 
</P>
<P>
When Georgetown played the Final Four in New Orleans, Georgetown stayed in 
Biloxi. When other teams were seen exploring the experience beyond the 
basketball games, Georgetown was out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton calls that priorities. He said they did the things the others did -- 
some of the things, anyhow. "If we stayed at the Hilton in New Orleans, people 
would have been knocking at our doors all day," he said. "We saw the French 
Quarter on our own. We went to the horse farm in Kentucky. We saw the locks in 
Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
They did it under careful monitoring. "It comes at that time of the semester," 
Dalton said. "Papers were due whether you were in the NCAA or not. I carried my 
big black book bag. If I'm in New Orleans, where am I going to do my paper? 
</P>
<P>
"John Thompson didn't lock us up. He provides an opportunity to do the things 
you have to do. You all call it 'hiding.' You have to draw the line someplace. 
The best thing that happend to me is that Coach Thompson provided that line for 
us. I'd do it again. While I did it, I had fun." 
</P>
<P>
While Thompson has railed against that which he feels is unfair to black 
athletes, he has not had a white player for several years. He did not contact 
Danny Ferry, who was the outstanding high school athlete in the Washington 
area, Georgetown's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton said the issue was never a subject among his teammates. If they were as 
aware of everything else as Dalton said they were, not discussing it would have 
been impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ask," Dalton said. "I can't say, 'This is because of ... ' And I'm not 
sure I want to know his logic." 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't consider accusing Thompson. His record is so good otherwise. He has 
refused to be drawn into that discussion in public. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to know his thinking on a lot of things. He mocks the observation that 
he has created an us-against-them mind-set among his players, but he does not 
dispel it. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have to toady to the needs or wants of the press. His obligation is 
to serve the needs of the school and the concept of student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
If Thompson and Georgetown have developed a system that makes student-athletes 
truly student-athletes, bottle it. Write a textbook. 
</P>
<P>
Let the world know and expose the other schools and other coaches that don't 
even try. That would be more valuable than going to the Final Four.

MICHIGAN'S FISHER IS HAVING A BALL

<P>
Last Christmas, Steve Fisher gave his wife Angie a telephone-answering machine; 
coincidentally, she presented him with the same gift. One machine was 
immediately returned, the other was to be used on just two occasions: during 
dinners and when the family was away on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
But back during the holidays, Fisher was an assistant to Michigan basketball 
coach Bill Frieder. Now, following Frieder's decision to take a job at Arizona 
State just before the start of the NCAA tournament, he's running the show 
himself and there's a third purpose for the contraption. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines, expected to fall apart, have advanced to the Final Four, where 
they'll meet Big Ten rival Illinois Saturday at the Seattle Kingdome. While 
clearly thrilled at the turn of events, Fisher winces at how the machine is 
currently being used. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many people calling," he said. "It's hard to put people 
off, but everything has to be put on hold for now. ... I never dreamed that I'd 
have the machine on, sitting there listening to the person who's calling, but 
I'm doing it -- sometimes I feel pretty guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Coaching at a major university in the shadow of big cities such as Detroit and 
Chicago, Fisher, 44, hasn't lost the touch of his rural Illinois upbringing. 
For that, he says he thanks his parents, Louise and George, who can probably do 
without what Fisher calls "my celebrity status." 
</P>
<P>
"The TV station from 50 miles away came to my town (Herrin, Ill.) and my father 
wouldn't let 'em in the door," he said, smiling. "Now my brothers, they'll let 
anybody who knocks inside." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Fisher's parents, like nearly everyone else who has been captivated by 
the story, are still getting used to what's transpired. After the Wolverines 
defeated Virginia to earn their berth in Seattle, CBS' Tim Brant introduced him 
to the nation as "Steve Frieder." 
</P>
<P>
Things aren't much better here in town. Frieder's picture is still prominently 
displayed in the Wolverines' Crisler Arena, right next to Athletic Director Bo 
Schembechler's, who ruled Frieder's new job cost him the privilege of coaching 
Michigan in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder said he understood Schembechler's decision to immediately dismiss him, 
but he still showed up in Atlanta, sitting in the stands, for Michigan's 
opening round wins over Xavier and South Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it's an emotional thing for me that I haven't been a visible part of 
the last two weeks, but I've been there in thought and spirit," Frieder said in 
a statement released by Arizona State. "I'm extremely happy for Steve Fisher 
and (assistant) Mike Boyd and the entire Michigan team. You have to understand 
I hired both Steve and Mike and they were my closest friends in Ann Arbor." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said he still talks by phone to his former boss, who already has moved 
to Arizona and has hit the road in search of players to help improve the Sun 
Devils' four-year record of 50-62. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Fisher said there have been times the last two weeks he's wished he'd 
kept both answering machines. That's perhaps as close as his affability's come 
to slipping under the stress of his sudden celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
"I've really enjoyed everything about it so far, but then again, things 
couldn't have gone better for me," he said. "We haven't blown a 20-point lead 
or put a Demetrius Calip in when he hadn't played before and then watched him 
turn the ball over to lose a game for us. Maybe in 10 years I'll be more 
callous, but right now all I have to do is nod my head and try and look 
humble." 
</P>
<P>
Really, Fisher is still marveling at the path his career has taken. A starter 
in just two games during his playing days at Illinois State, Fisher, was 
prepared to seek his fortune in that area when a friend, Leo Wothke, asked him 
to join him at Rich East High School in south suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Fisher arrived, Wothke left to become an assistant at Illinois, 
leaving Fisher in charge. Rich East had a 141-70 record during his eight years 
there, and although the team never won the state championship, the coach felt 
life was pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the kind of guy that could have stayed at Rich East forever," he said. 
"I had been there a long time, had met my wife there and the people liked us. 
We drove ourselves into the rut there a little more every year."

DUKE DOES WELL WITH OTHER FOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY KEENAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In preparation for the Final Four of the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association basketball tournament this weekend in Seattle, here's a Duke 
Aptitude Test: 
</P>
<P>
1. Which effusive Blue Devil decided he wanted to attend Duke while watching a 
news conference of he 1986 Final Four team because he liked the way the players 
interacted? Hint: He's a 6-10 freshman who can score from 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
2. Who is Duke's first Academic All-American since Mike Gminski, leads the team 
in steals (73) and ranks second on the university's all-time assist list? 
</P>
<P>
3. Who jumps like a human pogo stick but has the free-throw percentage (55.8) 
to go with his last name? Hint: He scored a team-high 21 points in Duke's win 
over Minnesota in the East Regional, yet lacks consistency. 
</P>
<P>
4. Which 6-4 Blue Devil considers himself "just a slightly above-average 
athlete" despite his spectacular dunk over 6-10 Alonzo Mourning and his 
emergence as a consistent scorer? 
</P>
<P>
If you couldn't answer at least three, you've been paying too much attention to 
two-time All-America Danny Ferry and not enough to his supporting crew. Give 
yourself an A if you answered, in order: center Christian Laettner, point guard 
Quin Snyder, forward Robert Brickey and off guard Phil Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Duke isn't just Ferry. If it were, the Blue Devils wouldn't be going to their 
third Final Four in his four seasons. "I think we've done a really good job of 
working together," Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "The whole team has learned how 
to play better with Danny and Phil, who has emerged as a consistently high 
scorer. We look at collective responsibility more than individual." 
</P>
<P>
Their next collective duty is trying to beat Seton Hall Saturday afternoon in 
Seattle in the semifinals. "They're hot," Snyder said, listing the Pirates' 
starters. "We watch enough ESPN to respect them." 
</P>
<P>
As the Pirates go over the tape of Duke's 85-77 East Regional win over 
Georgetown, they will come to appreciate the other Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner plays with the enthusiasm one expects from a freshman, minus the 
mistakes. "It helps us because it's genuine; it's not anything hot-dog," 
Krzyzewski said. "He wants to fit in; he's doing more than that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Laettner was on fire against the Hoyas, making 9 of 10 shots from the field and 
scoring a career-high 24 points. "Christian has had a great year," Ferry said. 
"He has a fire in his eye and that can be contagious. He can play, too." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder's contributions to Duke (28-7) can't be appreciated by examining numbers 
alone. Aside from his 219 assists, his stats aren't impressive: 28 percent 
three-point shooting, 7.0 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
But watch him. Early against Georgetown, he spied a quiet Duke bench. He 
glared. The players jumped. "Quin has unusual leadership qualitities even he 
probably didn't know he had. He's a very selfless player," his coach said. When 
Snyder fouled out with 3:22 remaining, Krzyzewski was worried. "We don't have 
an awful lot of ballhandlers. It made me very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
For a time this season, Krzyzewski was rather annoyed with Brickey and he took 
the starting job away from his small forward for nine of the final 10 
regular-season games. Turnovers and silly fouls were the problem. "Robert 
Brickey is an excellent basketball player who is trying to be a consistently 
excellent player," Krzyzewski said. "You don't know when he's going to come 
around." 
</P>
<P>
He has a 40-inch vertical jump. "Did you ever fantasize about going at an 
eight-foot basket?" Krzyzewski said. "It's like that for him." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder calls him The Weather Man. Others opt for Air Brickey. The junior has 
said that his goal was to be known as a "smart player."

RACING IN NEW YORK CONTINUES TO DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when horse racing in America could be divided into two tiers: 
New York, and everywhere else. Plenty of racing fans in Maryland can remember 
looking with constant envy on their counterparts in New York, who could go to 
Aqueduct amid crowds of 50,000 every Saturday and enjoy the sport at its best. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, much has changed since New York's golden years of the 1950s and 
1960s. Off-track betting has caused a sharp decline in on-track attendance, and 
competition from other prosperous racing circuits has somewhat diluted the 
quality of the racing. 
</P>
<P>
Even in view of these changes, though, an unwary visitor would be stunned at 
what he finds at Aqueduct nowadays: mediocre racing at a dirty, polluted 
physical plant populated by an ever-dwindling number of disgusted customers. 
</P>
<P>
The racing program at Aqueduct Thursday, for example, includes four maiden 
races (three of them for New York-breds). The non-maiden races couldn't attract 
more than nine horses, and the feature drew a field of five. Officials of the 
New York Racing Association readily acknowledge that the competition at the 
current meeting hasn't been good, but say it is the result of temporary and 
unusual financial conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We were clobbered by the jockeys' strike in the fall and our business took a 
dive," said NYRA President Gerald McKeon. "We announced purse cuts of 15 
percent in the winter meeting, and some of our larger stables decided to go to 
Florida. Our purses are back now, but the horses haven't returned, and the 
cards are filled with cheap races. These last three months feel like they've 
lasted three years." 
</P>
<P>
For the poor bettors who have been spending day after day in Aqueduct's 
grandstand, the last three months probably feel like three millenia. I was 
there for last Saturday's Bay Shore Stakes and one day was plenty. 
</P>
<P>
After hanging out in the clubhouse with some of my cronies for a few races, I 
began to notice that my throat was feeling raw and sore -- a familiar 
sensation, for Aqueduct customers are surrounded by smoky, stale air in that 
poorly ventilated enclosure. Handicapper Paul Cornman told me, "When I get home 
I have to change my clothes because they smell so badly from all the smoke. And 
it's really not too bad today -- the temperature's mild. When it gets to be 80 
degrees outside, it feels like 100 in here." 
</P>
<P>
So I went outside to breathe some fresh air and sit with some friends in 
Section N of the grandstand -- and felt as if I'd wandered into a slum in the 
Bronx. The floors were filthy, and the whole area looked as if had been 
bombarded by bird excrement. When I observed that the area looked as if it had 
been cleaned for months, one disgruntled bettor said, "I don't think they've 
cleaned it since the Breeders' Cup." That was November 1985. (McKeon insists 
that the track is "spanking clean before each day's races," but he must not 
have visited Section N lately.) 
</P>
<P>
The regular racegoers here can cite a litany of complaints, from chaos in the 
parking lots to drug use in the stairwells, but what maddens the people here 
more than any specific inconvenience or indignity is the attitude behind them. 
Joe Cardello, a professional bettor, says, "Just every horseplayer I know feels 
that the New York Racing Association doesn't care about its customers. 
Management takes the attitude that the hard-core bettors are going to come to 
the track regardless of how bad the conditions are." 
</P>
<P>
Maryland racing fans can feel pity and sympathy for their New York 
counterparts. When we tell the denizens of Aqueduct about the Sports Palace, 
about steadily rising attendance and purses at Laurel and Pimlico, about the 
tracks' fan-oriented management, New Yorkers have every reason to be jealous of 
us.

PENN COACH ACCEPTS MORE SERIOUS CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Football is an insular sport and it's not terribly difficult to develop an 
ivy-tower mentality at such a prestigious institution as the University of 
Pennsylvania. So much for stereotypes. To whatever degree they exist, they 
don't apply to Ed Zubrow. 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow recently resigned his position as head football coach at Penn. A man 
with two Ivy League championships to his credit in three years on the job, he 
wasn't forced out by disgruntled alumni, boosters or a board of regents seeking 
greater recognition for the program. He didn't leave for a more lucrative 
contract at a school where athletics surpasses academics on the list of 
priorities. He took a walk into the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"Our campus was pretty much protected," Zubrow said by telephone from 
Philadelphia where he has become the point man in the school district's efforts 
to combat drug abuse and dropouts. "But if you open your eyes at all, you know 
there's a problem that's spreading." 
</P>
<P>
And, at 38, with a real future in the football business, Zubrow decided he 
wanted to do something to curb that problem. "Many coaches have had a great 
deal of influence on me as an educator," he said. "What happened to me this 
fall is that I wanted to be involved in other challenges. This is the challenge 
now." 
</P>
<P>
His background is one of privilege. He graduated from Haverford College on the 
Main Line with a degree in American studies. He served as athletic director and 
coach at a tony prep school, Penn Charter. He was the chief recruiter at Penn 
under the successful Jerry Berndt and succeeded the man when the latter left 
for Rice. Drugs were not something he encountered on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pleased that we were able to attract kids from the inner cities to 
Pennsylvania," Zubrow said. "But the clear scourge of drugs had affected their 
family lives, deeply in some cases. And, being located in West Philadelphia, 
the university was involved with problems outside its gates." 
</P>
<P>
Zubrow recalled stopping for coffee at a convenience store near the campus and 
seeing a homeless man outside each morning. It raised his consciousness about 
the victims of society. "I've been reflecting for some time on the issues of 
our time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The search by Dr. Constance Clayton, superintendent of the nation's 
fifth-largest school district, for an aide to deal with the drug peril and 
potential dropouts struck Zubrow as a tremendous opportunity. "The real heroes 
now are the people on the front line," he decided. "Teachers, ministers, 
police." Not that Zubrow expects to be a hero in his new post. He just wants to 
do what he can before the disease reaches epidemic proportions. The man is 
married but childless, yet he fears for children growing up in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Football can wait. How long even he isn't sure. "I was never one to have a 
long-range game plan," he said. "I never even thought about being a head coach. 
I'd just make a decision to continue coaching each year." 
</P>
<P>
P.J. Carlesimo, whose Seton Hall team will oppose Duke in the NCAA championship 
semifinals on Saturday, attended high school at Scranton (Pa.) Prep. According 
to reports, Prep Coach Jack Gallagher was the model for the central character 
in "That Championship Season," the successful Broadway play and motion picture 
written by Jason Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"Prep people all say it was based on (Steve) Vacendak's junior year," Carlesimo 
said. Vacendak later became a starter on the Duke team that was ranked second 
in the nation and reached the Final Four in 1966. "Of course," Carlesimo added, 
"people at West Side St. Pat's say otherwise. Miller went to St. Pat's. I asked 
(Miller) once and he wouldn't say." 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego Padres manager Jack McKeon isn't an alumnus of Seton Hall, 
he did attend classes there before receiving his degree from Elon (N.C.) 
College. He didn't play basketball for the Pirates because he already had 
signed a professional baseball contract, and in those days pros and amateurs 
didn't mix. 
</P>
<P>
But, at 5-9, McKeon was the leading rebounder on a state championship club at 
St. Mary's in South Amboy, N.J. Among his teammates were Johnny and Eddie 
O'Brien, twin dynamos who starred at Seattle University before becoming 
infielders with the Pittsburgh Pirates. McKeon said he survived under the 
basket in St. Mary's 2-1-2 zone by clutching the shirts or shorts of much 
taller opponents. 
</P>
<P>
It came as no surprise to McKeon that Johnny O'Brien, also 5-9, was the first 
player to score more than 1,000 points in a college season and held NCAA 
records for most points, field goals and free throws in a career at the time of 
his graduation in 1953. "In high school," Trader Jack recalled, "I'd get the 
rebound, dribble it to half court, give it to Johnny and that was it. We called 
him 'Shots.' "

As the owner of a successful Help-U-Sell real estate office, I read with great 
interest David W. Myer's (March 12) discount brokers article as well as the 
response from several brokers in your "Letters" column (March 26). 
</P>
<P>
The response of these brokers typifies the lack of research and naivete of some 
so-called "full-service" competitors. 
</P>
<P>
We are licensed brokers and members of the local Board of Realtors. We submit 
(when it is in our seller's best interest) many of our listings to the Multiple 
Listing Service, put our phone number on the yard sign and in newspaper 
advertisements, screen the buyers, draw the real estate contract, cover all of 
the legal requirements and usher the transaction through escrow just as does 
the "full-service" brokerage. We are, in fact, a full-service brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't we charge a 6% commission? Because we don't hire hundreds of 
inexperienced licensees to knock on doors, cold call on the telephone, hand out 
little trinkets and spend 80% of our time just looking for clients. And we do 
not sell a "full-service package" unless the property and situation warrant it.

BUILDING CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Jan. 22, I was shocked to see a photo in your Real Estate Section of one of 
the most loathsome architectural creations in recent Los Angeles history. But I 
was delighted to finally learn that it has a name, a price and people claiming 
responsibility: Andrex Point/Los Angeles; $75 million, Johnson Fain &amp; 
Pereira Associates. Now I can point my finger at someone with derision. 
</P>
<P>
Andrex Point simply does not make sense above the first level of windows and 
the tasteful landscaping. It hints at slick, but doesn't use mirrored windows 
-- it uses a most uncomfortable flat, lifeless gray-green paneling and bands of 
dark glass. It departs from the square and the block with what I can only 
describe as vintage Winnebago. 
</P>
<P>
And then the final insult to someone's serious efforts, which became a joke: 
From the southbound 405 Freeway at about Normandie Avenue, the west facade 
turns into a grid of squiggles. It looks like a child's drawing, or a 
draftsman's who forgot to bring his straightedge to work.

COLD SHOWER ON DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to express a contrary opinion to the March 19 article by A. J. 
Hand, "Shower Door Better Than a Curtain." 
</P>
<P>
Shower enclosures may look good and may present a watertight, cozy enclosure 
(if installed correctly) for the shower taker, but they are a nuisance to bath 
takers and tub cleaners: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- If there are small children in a family, one cannot sit on the tub to 
bathe them because of the railing, but must kneel or crouch uncomfortably; 
</P>
<P>
2 -- One cannot place a bath tray across the tub -- the ledge has been narrowed 
by the railing; 
</P>
<P>
3 -- The cleaner of the tub is prevented by the width of the shower doors from 
reaching the whole tub and must clean one side, shift the door, then clean the 
other; 
</P>
<P>
4 -- The rails become filled with dirt and must be constantly cleaned out; the 
shower doors become coated with soap scum and one must go inside the tub to 
clean the glass. 
</P>
<P>
After putting up with glass shower door enclosures over my tub (they are fine 
for stall showers), I finally had them taken out in both bathrooms. What a 
relief! Of course, we had to fill in the holes drilled in the tile to support 
the side rails and the area where the bottom rails were installed is a lighter 
color than the rest of the tub, but it is worth it. Having a double shower 
curtain, vinyl inner curtain, decorative outer curtain, prevents water seepage 
and, best of all, I can now clean the tub with ease.

<P>
Once and for all, can we please set the record straight? The Los Angeles Police 
Department has no plans, and will never have any plans, to expand the grounds 
of the police academy in Elysian Park. Perhaps, if (Sam Hall) Kaplan would have 
checked with the department before he wrote his column (March 19), it would not 
have contained so much erroneous information. 
</P>
<P>
A major fact Kaplan missed was that in 1972 the issue of moving the academy out 
of the park went before city voters. The enormous expense of moving the academy 
and of not having a facility centrally located were extensively debated. The 
result was that voters decided the academy should stay at the same location it 
had occupied since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
The article also failed to include the fact that no city official, elected or 
otherwise, can act to have the current site enlarged. To add more acreage would 
require the matter to be placed on the ballot for voter approval. I seriously 
doubt that would ever happen. It is also important to note that the proposed 
academy remodeling would, should Proposition 2 garner two-thirds voter approval 
this month, be less intrusive upon the surrounding community because the 
parking will be underground and the pistol ranges indoors and soundproof. 
</P>

Sam Hall Kaplan replies: 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Berg is correct. The Police Department has no plans on record to expand 
the grounds of the Police Academy in Elysian Park. What the department wants is 
to expand the academy itself, tripling its size to an estimated 224,000 square 
feet, according to preliminary plans. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes increasing the parking from 400 spaces to 1,000 spaces in a two- 
and three-story structure. Because of unstable soil conditions, the parking 
facility would not be built underground. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be obvious that such an expansion, costing about $40 million of the 
$176-million bond issue to construct, will have an impact on Elysian Park.

VIETNAMESE STUDENT'S ODYSSEY TO CALTECH; 
</P>
<P>
BOAT REFUGEE FINDS BALANCE BETWEEN 2 WORLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYBIL BAKER, Baker is a free-lancer who lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's like a trip to the middle of the country in the middle of the century. 
Andy Hardyville. On this Pasadena block, old oaks and camphor trees arch into a 
canopy of green lace over the street; front yards are fragrant with flower beds 
bordering the squares of new mint-green grass. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment is decorated in Early Student. A poster of a bathing beauty. A 
license plate tacked on the wall. The TV is on. The MTV channel -- what else? 
The occupant is a student, as a matter of fact, a sophomore at Caltech in 
Pasadena. He will be 21 in June. True to the code, he wears acid jeans. 
</P>
<P>
But when Tan Pham speaks (both first and last names have the same vowel sound 
as calm) his views are hardly mainstream American. He doesn't care if he ever 
makes a lot of money, he says. 
</P>
<P>
That "money seems to be everything these days" can get on his nerves, he says, 
and so do "people who fall for money; who will do anything for money." He says 
he has had some friends who have done that. 
</P>
<P>
His apartment is on the second floor. And from a visitor's vantage point, the 
nerves he refers to are about as apparent as a ladybug would be on the lawn 
below. Pham radiates a sunny serenity. "I can be very nasty," he insists 
merrily. "I can lose my temper." Then he feels compelled to add: "For a few 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Pham spent his first 13 years in Vietnam. "My family was well-educated, and 
wanted me to leave to get a better education," he said, and staying in Vietnam 
would have meant joining the army at 18. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Departure Kept Secret 
</P>
<P>
His parents arranged for him to escape through a leader who organized the 
venture and was paid accordingly. "My parents didn't tell me until the day I 
was supposed to leave," to make sure he wouldn't inadvertently betray the plan. 
</P>
<P>
He has no trouble recalling his reaction to the news: "I just wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
For 11 days, the boy sat in a boat with 21 other people. Studying the 
dimensions of his modest apartment for a moment, he says the boat was about the 
width of the living room, and perhaps as long as the living room plus the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran out of food a few times. But fortunately, we met some fishing boats, 
and they gave us some food." Reading of the ordeals of other boat people makes 
him realize how much worse it could have been. "When people have to kill each 
other -- I never experienced that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Pham and his fellow refugees landed in Macao, across the bay from Hong Kong. 
And then the homesickness finally hit him, as a nine-month stay in a refugee 
camp began. 
</P>
<P>
A cousin in Hawaii sponsored Pham's entry into the United States, which led to 
another four months in a camp in the Philippines that was designed to prepare 
refugees for life here. "They taught us English." He looked doubtful. "Well, 
not much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The international language of math saved him. Without that, "It would have been 
a lot more difficult. That's how I got brave enough to communicate with 
people." 
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii, an English teacher at the public school he was attending encouraged 
him to apply at a private school, where he was accepted. "My English was very 
horrible then," he said. "But I just took the test anyway, in case -- who 
knows?" Aiming at a career in physics, he came to the mainland to attend 
Caltech 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pham has four brothers and two sisters. One sister escaped Vietnam and is 
living in Holland, and his 15-year-old brother is living with him now in 
Pasadena. It's a big responsibility, he concedes. "I try to sort of tell him, 
just don't do the bad things. As long as he gets to a decent college. That's 
all I want. That's all my parents want." 
</P>
<P>
He works part time as a programmer for First Quadrant, an investment firm in 
Pasadena, gets A's and Bs at college, and keeps in touch with his parents, who 
don't intend to try and escape themselves, he says -- "just to send their 
children out." 
</P>
<P>
About half his friends are American, and about half are Vietnamese: "I think 
that's a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
How are the disparate cultures of the two sets demonstrated? "The way you eat, 
the way you act, the things you talk about, the way you treat people." 
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the young defer to the old; "Americans tend to do the opposite." Pham 
said, "I realize my parents' purpose for sending me out. I don't want to 
disappoint them." At the same time, he appreciates that "here, we have the 
right to express our opinions." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to go back there now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And so here he is, like a tightrope performer with a long pole. To steady 
himself, a dip into the East here, into the West there. He is balanced because 
he is centered. His father believed in him, he says. And, he says: "I believe 
in myself."

STUDENT COUNSELORS GIVE FREE THERAPY TO TROUBLED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brenda Webster was upset about her daughter's temper and poor grades. One 
morning last fall the 10-year-old refused to get ready for school and spat on 
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to shut the door before I did something to hurt her," Webster said. "I 
just didn't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Webster, her daughter attends Marshall Elementary School in the 
Garvey School District. The district had just started a pilot program in which 
students studying for master's degrees in counseling from Cal State L.A. 
provide free therapy to troubled children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Mission Possible, the program aims at improving academic performance by 
reducing family problems, targeting children who are failing, hyperactive or 
who have high truancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. students benefit by getting counseling experience in a school 
setting. They also conduct parental guidance workshops at the schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Therapy After Work 
</P>
<P>
Since September, 25 university students have counseled 39 families in six 
schools, according to Marcel Soriano, director of pupil personnel services and 
district coordinator of the program. He is negotiating with Ingleside Hospital 
in Rosemead for space so parents can come for therapy after work hours. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said that counseling sessions with student Tim Bruce had given her new 
skills in being a parent. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're growing up (it seems) your mother always knows what to do," 
Webster said, adding that she now realizes that parenting skills do not come 
naturally. Using advice from Bruce, Webster said she now tries to think before 
losing her temper at her child. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who meets weekly for counseling sessions in the school library, said 
that for financial reasons she is unable to get professional help. Her daughter 
leaves her class an hour each week for the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since she started going to (Bruce) she's gotten real mellow, even when 
he's not there," Webster said, adding that her daughter fights less often with 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Families With Problems 
</P>
<P>
Mission Possible is the brainchild of Brian Gerrard, coordinator of the 
marriage, family and child counseling program at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working with multiproblem families," said Gerrard, with some households 
struggling with alcoholism, sexual or physical abuse or drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
School counselors are not trained to intervene in family problems and many 
parents do not follow up on suggestions to seek professional therapy because of 
time and financial constraints, Gerrard said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're reaching families that otherwise would not receive treatment," he said. 
"We're more likely to make an impact on school success because we're starting 
early. By secondary school, (the children) are firmly entrenched in gangs and 
who knows what, and the family ceases to have an influence." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time his students, who typically obtain counseling experience in 
either government or private agencies, learn to work with the school system. 
</P>
<P>
Gerrard said counselors have a better chance of reaching a troubled child if 
they work within the child's environment. 
</P>
<P>
An important reason the Garvey district was selected as "a good laboratory to 
try out the project" was its diverse racial and socioeconomic mix, Gerrard 
said. Of the district's 7,313 students, 54% are Latino and 39% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that some Latinos and Asians are more reluctant to seek help because 
of a stronger stigma against therapy in their cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, as the coordinator of the marriage, family and child 
counseling program at the University of San Francisco, Gerrard started a 
similar program in 15 Catholic elementary schools that is still operating. The 
first formal evaluation of that program will be conducted in June. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to expand the program in the Garvey district by eventually supplying 
up to four interns for each of the district's schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practical Training 
</P>
<P>
If results of an evaluation this summer are favorable, counseling students 
would provide therapy on a 10-month contract with the program, Gerrard said. 
Most of the students would be working toward the 3,000 hours of practical 
training required for state licenses in marriage, family and child counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The district would help by overseeing the interns' performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our dream is to provide such quality of supervision as to draw interns from 
other universities," Soriano said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Principal Marilyn Malmquist said she is "super pleased" with the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents of the 10 to 15 students she recommends for professional 
counseling each year never seek help, but families are faithful about keeping 
their appointments with Bruce, she said. "They're familiar and comfortable 
(meeting the counselor) in the school. It's far less threatening," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce said he has been gratified by the rapport he has been able to establish 
with the children because he is working in their environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sat on the jungle gyms and talked. They're much more open and realistic 
here than in a clinic, where they're afraid of saying the wrong thing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have kids that don't like to write that write me their life stories," said 
Bruce, who asks some children to draw if they can't verbalize their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"They say there is nothing wrong in their lives, but they use blacks and very 
harsh colors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Counseling students have also been assigned to the district's two junior high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deeply Rooted Problems 
</P>
<P>
"Parents think it's up to the schools to worry about grades and make sure (the 
children) do what they're supposed to do," said Salome Dineros who interns at 
Garvey Intermediate School in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 weeks of counseling, Dineros, who is also the coordinator of the 
college's guidance clinic, has convinced two 13-year-olds that they ought to 
quit skipping school. She is now working on persuading them to improve their 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of both youths had been separated. 
</P>
<P>
"When something's happening in the home, the kids take it out on academics to 
get attention," Dineros said. 
</P>
<P>
"The children's problems are deeply rooted in the family problem," echoed 
intern Phyllis Davidson, who counsels two boys disinterested in school work at 
Monterey Vista Elementary School in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The single mothers of the 6-year-old and 9-year-old students have been in and 
out of jail for drug abuse, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both (families) said they didn't want to come back at first, but now the 
children are eager to see me," she said.

<P>
SCULPTOR RACES DEATH TO REPAIR STATUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite ill health and waning strength, sculptor William Van Orden was back at 
work last week, trying to save Venice High School's famous statue of actress 
Myrna Loy from an unending assault by vandals. 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden, who has repaired the statue 12 times over the last decade, had 
doubted he would have the strength to repair the statue the last time it was 
attacked by vandals in February. The 66-year-old artist says that he suffers 
from cancer and that his doctors have given him two months to live. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I decided I couldn't abandon her," he said. "I had to return one more 
time. This is my life's work, and after I finish this job I feel I can pass the 
job on to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outpouring of Support 
</P>
<P>
Van Orden received an outpouring of support and nearly $600 in donations after 
a recent Times article about his efforts to preserve the statue and two others 
on the campus -- replacing heads and arms that were battered and once even 
destroyed by dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been so generous," he said. "They are treating me like a king." 
Van Orden said a financial donation and the pledge of further support came from 
the New York producers of a planned musical based on the light-hearted mystery 
film "The Thin Man," in which Loy gained fame playing opposite William Powell. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-foot-tall statue of Loy, depicting the goddess Venus rising from the sea, 
was sculpted in the 1920s by Harry Winebrenner, a nationally known sculptor who 
also taught art at Venice High School. He chose as his model a 16-year-old art 
student named Myrna Williams, who later gained fame in films as Myrna Loy. 
Winebrenner used student models for the two other statues as well. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the statues have been the targets of pranksters and vandals. 
The most recent attack occurred in February when vandals scaled a well-lit 
protective fence surrounding the statues and damaged the heads of the Loy 
statue and two other figures. 
</P>
<P>
In response to that attack -- the first since the fence was put up in 1987 -- 
school officials plan to enclose the statues in a cage and install motion 
detectors that will trip an alarm system. "We hope that will do the trick," 
said Principal Andrea L. Natker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dedication Ceremony 
</P>
<P>
Now that the restoration has begun, students are planning a dedication ceremony 
near the end of the school year. They even invited Loy, who is 83 and lives in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
"They were able to get through to her in New York and called her," Natker said. 
"She said she appreciated what was being done, but she said she would not be 
able to come." 
</P>
<P>
At the high school lastweek, Van Orden, who recently underwent radiation 
treatment for his cancer, was working six hours a day restoring the damaged 
heads with a water-based clay. 
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to modify the face of the Loy statue. "I want to make her the 
way she was as a movie star during the height of her popularity," he said. "I 
don't want her to be a 16-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
When the clay heads are completed, he said, molds will be taken and concrete 
replacement heads will be fashioned from the molds and attached to the statues. 
The whole job should take less than a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racing Against Time 
</P>
<P>
But time suddenly has become a factor for Van Orden, who has spent thousands of 
hours restoring the statues. 
</P>
<P>
"There really isn't much time," he said as he moved quickly around the statues, 
shaping the facial features with his fingers. "I really feel like I am racing 
against time. I think I can win the race as long as I stay at it." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has received little payment for his trouble, Van Orden said the 
recognition his work has brought him from the students and his family has been 
its own reward. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been my dream to have my family proud of me and now they are," he said. 
"All my life I have been wandering around the country, working odd jobs to 
support my work. This has given me something to be proud of and something for 
them to remember me by."

TENACIOUS INVESTIGATORS WORKED LONG HOURS TO UNCOVER ALLEGED HOUSING SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department Inspector David Castaneda was asking a lot of coy 
questions, letting his eyes wander across desktops and snapping Polaroid 
pictures of the hired help, who were not smiling. 
</P>
<P>
From a back room in the cramped Wilshire Boulevard office of T.H.I.S. Corp., a 
man emerged, grabbed Castaneda's elbow and shoved him outside, slamming the 
inspector's arm against the door. Castaneda, dressed in uniform, managed to get 
a shot of him, too. 
</P>
<P>
His heart pounding, Castaneda stared at the door that had been locked behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are they throwing me out of the office?" he remembers thinking. "Why am I 
not supposed to be in there? I don't even know who that guy is?" 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda, 34, was not there that day back in October, 1985, to check for smoke 
detectors or frayed wiring. A frustrated member of the city's slum housing task 
force, he had broadened his duties to investigate how a number of Los Angeles 
slumlords were managing to evade city enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The information he uncovered in hundreds of public records and in his sleuthing 
helped lead last week to a novel racketeering lawsuit against two lending 
institutions accused of secretly controlling Los Angeles' worst slum buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was more a labor of obsession than expertise. There were no 
teams of specialized investigators assigned to the case, only several people 
with no real knowledge of the byzantine banking industry or the mind-numbing 
world of property transactions. 
</P>
<P>
On their own time and between other assignments, they pursued an investigation 
that the city attorney's office is calling the most significant breakthrough 
yet in Los Angeles' continuing efforts to provide livable housing for its poor. 
</P>
<P>
Filed by the city attorney's office, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles 
and a private law firm, the lawsuit alleges that Highland Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan Assn. and A &amp; B Loan Co. used front men and shell corporations -- 
including T.H.I.S. -- to inflate the value of 11 slum properties through 
frequent transfers of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of dollars in rents were diverted to the lenders to cover 
the escalating mortgages, the suit says, instead of being used to maintain 408 
units in the buildings, most of which are inhabited by recent immigrants in the 
city's poorest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Loans on one run-down building alone ballooned from $405,000 to $2.6 million as 
it changed owners six times in four years. One owner turned out to be a dog, 
according to the complaint, which seeks civil damages and an injunction to stop 
such practices in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Federal has denied any wrongdoing, while A &amp; B Loan Co. has yet to 
comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was largely the work of Castaneda, a 14-year veteran who 
began as a firefighter; Deputy City Atty. Stephanie Sautner, who wishes she had 
paid more attention in her property law class, and Legal Aid lawyer Deborah 
Dentler, who had to scrounge documents because the foundation could not afford 
the $320 she needed to make her own copies. 
</P>
<P>
Sautner is a former New York City police officer who heads the city attorney's 
slum housing task force, perhaps the most innovative in the nation, which has 
successfully prosecuted several notorious slumlords. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes of Owners 
</P>
<P>
She says the inquiry began after a number of slum buildings kept changing 
owners just before the city was prepared to move against them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our own egos were so great," she says, "that we thought they would do anything 
to avoid being prosecuted by us." Instead, Sautner says she would later learn, 
the lenders allegedly were interested in boosting property values so they could 
reap more money on the mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Fire inspector Castaneda had become "crazy with frustration," Sautner says. He 
volunteered to spend his mornings at the county recorder's office studying 
documents on the rat- and crime-infested buildings that were changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Something smelled fishy and I wanted to know what it was," he says, "Why can't 
we hook these people?" 
</P>
<P>
After staring at microfilm for days, he says he found "too many common 
denominators" among the buildings, including two institutions that had made 
loans on the property, Highland Federal and A &amp; B Loan. He says he also 
noticed that some companies involved in the transactions had different names 
but were using the same addresses. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was uncovering something," he says, "and I couldn't let up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orders to Go Ahead 
</P>
<P>
At the task force's weekly Wednesday meetings, he would report his findings to 
Sautner, who instructed him to press ahead. She briefed City Atty. James K. 
Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we knew the complete picture about the way slumlords were 
operating," Hahn said. "But then we were learning that there was another level. 
That made us very angry." 
</P>
<P>
Next, Castaneda embarked on some amateur detective work, tracking down people 
and corporations listed as owners of the dilapidated buildings. He went to 
T.H.I.S. Corp., but got nothing except a rude goodby. 
</P>
<P>
At one address, he says, there was no building. Another was nothing more than a 
post office box inside a copying shop; the box number, he says, was listed in 
property records as a "suite." 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda says he traced one purported building owner to a stationery store. He 
figured the guy probably owned the business. He was a delivery boy. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the man who lived in one of the slum buildings and did not 
know he owned it -- on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the owner," Castaneda says he informed the man. 
</P>
<P>
"No I'm not," he responded. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't this your signature?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but I never signed that." 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda said he made a note to himself that the document had been notarized 
by the same person whose name appeared on other property transactions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eyes and Ears 
</P>
<P>
For help, Castaneda had plenty of eyes and ears. He often turned to the 
tenants, who, among other things, jotted down license plate numbers and 
provided him with detailed descriptions of the rent collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone appreciated Castaneda's efforts. Nasty letters started coming in 
to the Fire Department from a lawyer and Highland Federal's president, accusing 
the inspector of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda says he was questioned by his bosses, who "told me to continue on so 
long as I don't violate anybody's rights." 
</P>
<P>
The high turnover of slum building ownership also had caught the attention of 
the nonprofit Legal Aid Foundation, which has represented scores of tenants in 
disputes with slumlords. 
</P>
<P>
In examining 10 years worth of property records for one building at her kitchen 
table, Legal Aid's Dentler discovered that it had passed through nearly 20 
different owners. She, like deputy city attorney Sautner, had come to believe 
that "there was a bigger picture but nobody knew what it was." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that particularly puzzled them was why dummy corporations and people 
with seemingly risky credit histories were getting loans to buy properties. 
</P>
<P>
With both Legal Aid and the city attorney's office strapped for resources, the 
two women decided to pursue the mushrooming case together, forming a team that 
Dentler compared to television's "Cagney &amp; Lacey." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working as a Team 
</P>
<P>
"We come from completely different backgrounds," Dentler says. "Stephanie was a 
cop, a working-class kid, hard-bitten. I'm a typical bleeding heart liberal 
from an affluent background. We are not best friends by any means, but we are a 
good work team. We would pull each other out of the depths of despair." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they divided up the properties that needed to be studied. 
They also took turns sitting through a civil trial that, in a stroke of good 
timing, would prove to be one of the major turning points in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
They had been tipped to the trial by television reporter Jim Forbes, who for 
years has been investigating the financial ties of slumlords for KCBS-TV. The 
case involved two important figures: a Los Angeles slumlord, who had owned some 
of the buildings under investigation, and Highland Federal. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the trial disclosed that the bank had knowingly approved a false 
loan application submitted by slumlord Joseph Fitzpatrick in the name of his 
Spanish-speaking maid. 
</P>
<P>
Highland President Ben Karmelich approved the $217,669 loan on the property, 
which was not a slum building, and then authorized Fitzpatrick to cash the 
check. Karmelich testified that he had sanctioned the transaction because 
Fitzpatrick was a credit-worthy customer who was good for the money. The maid 
lost her bid to get the building, but the neophyte investigators had more 
leads. 
</P>
<P>
"It was exactly like the scenario we had cooked up in our minds," Dentler says. 
"An illiterate Spanish-speaking maid who had never had a dime and found herself 
on the title of an apartment building for the benefit of a group of financiers. 
We knew we were on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
Testimony also surfaced in the trial that Highland Federal had issued a 
slum-property loan to one Teluce Black -- purportedly the name of Fitzpatrick's 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan for Action 
</P>
<P>
By now, the city attorney's office and Legal Aid had agreed that a class-action 
lawsuit should be prepared -- targeting the financial institutions -- on behalf 
of the city and the tenants whose rents had bankrolled the alleged scam. 
</P>
<P>
But for the tenants to recover money, yet another player would have to be 
brought into play because neither the city attorney's office nor the federally 
funded Legal Aid Foundation can sue for money damages. 
</P>
<P>
Dentler said she tried to recruit a half dozen major law firms. Their initial 
response, she says, was, "we're opposed to slumlords. Let's go get 'em." But 
when the conversation turned to suing the lenders, Dentler recalls, "they got 
cold feet," concerned that the case would lead to laws harmful to their banking 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
More disappointment was to follow. Dentler had finally managed to corral the 
huge law firm of Finley, Kumble in the summer of 1987, only to see it go under 
within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just blown away," she recalls. "I thought I had it made." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Dentler persuaded Litt &amp; Stormer to handle the case, a major 
commitment of time and resources for the relatively small firm. "It was not the 
megafirm I had fantasized about," Dentler says, but it had sued slumlords 
before and knew racketeering law. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, roughly three years of laborious 
and often boring work came together in the 95-page lawsuit that, itself, took 
more than three months for Litt &amp; Stormer to draft. In a sense, the 
controversy is only beginning. By all accounts, the case will take years to 
plod through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
On the day the suit was filed, Castaneda gave himself a private pat on the back 
as he sat in his shoe-box office on the 9th Floor of City Hall East. 
</P>
<P>
"I kinda feel pleased," says the inspector, who has moved on to other 
assignments. "that my efforts did not fall by the wayside . . . I feel for 
those tenants. They don't deserve to live like that."

LAKERS ALLOW NUGGETS TO TIE, THEN LOSE IN OVERTIME, 114-108 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officially, this was an overtime loss for the Lakers. They played the 
five-minute extra period with every intent to beat the Denver Nuggets. But, as 
confirmed afterward, the Lakers really lost it in the final seconds of 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a three-point lead with nine seconds to play, seemingly all the Lakers 
had to do to win was not allow a three-point basket. But the worst-case 
scenario unfolded, as Walter Davis sank a three-point shot, sending the teams 
into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
From that point, the Lakers pretty much expired. The Nuggets took control and 
posted a 114-108 victory, one in which the Lakers felt they simply gave away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we gave them a gift," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "It's happened to us 
a lot of times. The three-pointer was inexcusable. You don't leave a guy open 
on the perimeter." 
</P>
<P>
This was a game that meant more for the Nuggets to win than the Lakers. Denver 
is jockeying for playoff position, while Riley pretty much conceded that the 
Lakers will not catch the Detroit Pistons for the league's best record. The 
loss left the Lakers (48-22) three games ahead of the second-place Phoenix Suns 
in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
So, if the motivation was with the Nuggets, so, too, was the proper execution 
of big plays at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, seemingly more susceptible than usual to the fatigue that hits 
visiting teams in the mile-high city, were playing without backup Mychal 
Thompson and, in the final minutes, without guard Michael Cooper, who suffered 
a bruised thigh. 
</P>
<P>
After Magic Johnson made a layup -- but missed an accompanying free throw after 
being fouled -- to give the Lakers a 97-94 lead with 37 seconds to play, the 
Nuggets scored quickly on a layup by Danny Schayes. But the Lakers got that 
back on Byron Scott's jump shot with 13 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
That was when the Lakers broke down. Lafayette Lever inbounded the ball to 
Schayes at the high post. Two Lakers converged on Schayes, who passed to Davis 
open on the perimeter. Davis swished a three-point shot to tie it, 99-99. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, however, still had a chance to pull it out in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
A.C. Green inbounded the ball to Johnson, the Lakers' designated last-second 
specialist. With Lever guarding him closely, Johnson could not shake free. 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar approached to set a screen, but that didn't free Johnson, 
either. With time running out, Johnson flipped a pass to Abdul-Jabbar, who 
missed a 17-foot jump shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Overtime was all Denver, as Alex English scored six of the Nuggets' first seven 
points for a 106-101 lead. The closest the Lakers would pull in overtime would 
be 106-104 after Abdul-Jabbar's three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers made just three of seven free-throw attempts in overtime, perhaps an 
indication of their fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Even Riley, when he emerged from the locker to meet the media afterward, gave a 
weary sigh. But his may have been more from frustration than fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Lakers were outscored, 15-9, in overtime, Riley still pointed 
to Davis' three-point basket as the Lakers' biggest transgression. 
</P>
<P>
"Schayes was inside the three-point line, so you let him drive to the basket 
and score," Riley said. "We had a three-point lead. For some reason, our 
defense tried to help on Schayes and left their guys open. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the third time this has happened to us. We left guys open against New 
Jersey (in December, when Chris Morris' three-point basket sent the game to 
overtime) and against Milwaukee (also in December, when Craig Hodges' field 
goal won it). We can't let that happen. It's a gift." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who had 20 points, 17 rebounds and 15 assists, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the game," Johnson said. "But we just lost it ourselves. Any time you 
are up three points with, what, nine seconds left, you're supposed to have it. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have guarded all the perimeter guys. A basket like that cost us the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who had 17 points, was guarding Davis on the play. He sagged inside and 
recovered too late to put a hand in Davis' face. 
</P>
<P>
Had Cooper not suffered a bruised thigh with 1:26 to play in regulation, Riley 
said he probably would have had him in for defensive purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"Coop, in that situation, would have really helped," Johnson said. "He's good 
at denying the shot." 
</P>
<P>
But the Nuggets have a multitude of three-point specialists, including Michael 
Adams, who sank four of eight three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they wanted to go to anyone on the perimeter," Riley said. "It was 
just a defensive breakdown. It's always fatiguing coming up here. But we've got 
to forget about this and go home and play Milwaukee (tonight)." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Magic Johnson's 16th triple-double of the season, the Lakers 
received 22 points and 13 rebounds from A.C. Green and 25 points from James 
Worthy. . . . With a basket on short jump shot with 5:46 to play in the second 
quarter, the Nuggets' Alex English passed Elgin Baylor to move into seventh 
place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. English led the Nuggets with 31 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was presented with a golden nugget chain and a vacation 
package to Vail as part of a halftime ceremony on the 20th stop on his farewell 
tour. Dan Issel, the former Nugget center, was the master of ceremonies. 
Abdul-Jabbar on his sky trip: "If you don't see me again during the playoffs, 
you'll see me up in the mountains trying to learn how to ski." . . . Lafayette 
Lever aggravated a pulled hamstring in Thursday night's game against Seattle, 
but played 41 minutes Saturday night and had 22 points and 12 rebounds.

JIM MURRAY: CONSISTENCY MAKES KING QUEEN OF LINKS

RANCHO MIRAGE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's no secret golf is facing an identity crisis. A different winner every 
week, relays of faceless college kids who have not yet learned how tough a game 
it is, taking over on the tour with all these seagoing, no-brainer putts and 
miracle shots out of trees. 
</P>
<P>
The game looks in vain for a star. It waits for one to crash out of a pack that 
has become about as easy to pick an individual out of as a crowd shot. 
</P>
<P>
There used to be readily identifiable faces. Swings. Players whose 
accomplishments stood alone, who were larger than life, golfers whose names 
made crossword puzzles, cereal boxes, who had their own lines of golf clubs. 
But the sport has become more a lottery than a game. 
</P>
<P>
Except for this one player who seems to be coasting quietly along, winning a 
tournament or two a year, piling up recognition points, appearing on TV cameras 
with some regularity. 
</P>
<P>
This player doesn't attack the course the way Arnold Palmer did. The strategy 
is to romance it, not wake it up. Go for the fat part of the green, play around 
trouble, take the percentage shot rather than the longshot. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite? Who said anything about Tom Kite? We're talking Betsy King here. It's 
not only men's golf that is suffering from an overdose of anonymity but the 
women's game as well. 
</P>
<P>
Men's golf used to have Hogan, Snead, Nicklaus, Palmer, Trevino; and even 
earlier, Jones, Sarazen and Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
Well, women's golf used to have Babe Zaharias, Patty Berg, Glenna Collett Vare, 
Louise Suggs, Mickey Wright. Now, it seems to have a whole bunch of women named 
Penny, a few Lynns and Amys and Pattys -- but the only player the public will 
recognize on sight is Nancy Lopez. They all seem to have gone to Furman, and 
they all play the game like a card player who keeps hoping for a pair of aces 
but keeps turning over treys. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King stands out because she has discovered how to a) make money and b) 
win. Since 1984, Betsy has hit the winner's circle 16 times. Not even Nancy 
Lopez can match that gaudy streak. In that string, she has won $1,623,719. She 
has already won twice this year, beating Lopez by six shots in the year's 
opening tournament in Jamaica and shooting a 14-under-par to beat Jane Geddes 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy is not surprised. She thinks she has the best two instruction books in 
the world -- the Old and New Testament. They don't tell you how to hit a wood 
shot over water. But they tell you what to do when the shot doesn't come off. 
Smile. And go on to the next one. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy does not entirely rely on Scriptures for her birdies. She has her guru, 
as do most women on the LPGA tour. Hers is the taskmaster, Ed Oldfield, who is 
of the old school who believes the real secret of golf is hard work. 
</P>
<P>
In grade school, Betsy King was about as unlikely a candidate for future 
stardom as ever picked up a nine iron. Never mind the braces on the teeth, the 
skinny legs. The Coke bottle glasses made it appear as if the only way she 
could read a break on a green was by Braille. Her eyesight varied from 20/200 
to 20/Terrible. She used to play golf in her native Pennsylvania with a brother 
who became an outstanding amateur player and, briefly, a pro, and then a 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Golf was an important outlet for a young girl who was shy, bespectacled, very 
apt to blush. Some girls take to reading Charlotte Bronte in those 
circumstances. Betsy took to reading greens. She got good enough to become the 
low amateur (and eighth overall) in the 1976 U.S. Women's Open. At a prom, she 
might have been a wallflower. On a golf course, she was a belle of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Soft contact lenses only made Betsy King better. A chronic tinkerer with her 
swing, she pieced together one which other members of the tour say is as 
compact and glitch-proof as, say, Gene Littler's. Betsy is not so sure. "I take 
a swipe at it," she insists. "I'm a striker of the ball, not a picture 
swinger." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever she is, it works. For seven years, she wore out driving-range tees 
while her game seesawed to where she just about broke even on the tour. Once 
the log jam broke, Betsy was one of the ones to beat week-in and week-out. She 
was as steady as a heartbeat, won two to four tournaments every year. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents sent her to Furman because South Carolina seemed just far enough 
from the fleshpots of Philadelphia for a young woman, but Betsy was hardly the 
disco type anyway. Golf was her only true love. A green was the only dance 
floor she wanted to shine on. 
</P>
<P>
The rap against women players is they are inconsistent. Betsy is so consistent 
it makes people sick. 
</P>
<P>
She plays position golf. She doesn't play that 
hit-it-find-it-and-go-hit-it-again game. They used to say Hogan had three 
fairways, right, middle and left. The rest of the world saw one. Betsy's game 
is not refined to the point she sees three corridors to every green, but she 
does not close her eyes and swing, either. "I try to think of the next shot," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't always make for birdie-binges. But it pays the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Consistency looked as if it were going to have a bad week down here at the 
Nabisco Dinah Shore as Betsy opened with an un-Kingly 73-75 or four-over-par. 
But, order was restored in the Kingdom Saturday as she shot the day's low round 
-- 68 -- and vaulted over several players in the treacherous winds that raked 
the Mission Hills course. She may not win but she will, as usual, be in the 
photo. At least, women's golf may have found its King -- in name as well as in 
deed.

WITH SOME KEY PLAYERS MISSING, SOCKERS ARE FINDING THEMSELVES 
</P>

<P>
The Sockers don't have their point-scoring leader, Branko Segota. They don't 
have their goal-scoring leader, Zoran Karic. Both are out with injuries. But if 
things aren't apple pie a la mode, they aren't too bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
Take Saturday's 4-3 victory over the Dallas Sidekicks at the Sports Arena. 
Nothing too spectacular. Nothing overly flashy. But the Sockers found a way to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't like that feeling that you're not going to win without certain 
players," defender Kevin Crow said. "(The Sockers) have always been able to 
lose a few players and play at a higher level for a few games." 
</P>
<P>
So that's what seems to be happening. Last week, the Sockers turned in their 
most impressive performance of the season, defeating Baltimore, 7-1, on the 
road following unimpressive losses to Wichita and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the Sockers skipped to a 4-1 lead and then hung on in front of 9,136. 
Midffielder Chris Chueden scored what would eventually be the game-winner with 
5:50 remaining in the third quarter, taking a free kick from Steve Zungul and 
driving it past Sidekick goalie Krys Sobieski. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman had a hint of a smile on his face after the game. The 
chemistry is back. He's even talking about first place again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good win for us because we can start thinking about the top spot," said 
Newman, whose team trails Baltimore by just 2 1/2 games in the Major Indoor 
Soccer League standings. "Anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said the victory last week in Baltimore set the tone for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we rode the adversity," he said. "You could feel it on the bench 
that we weren't going to quit. Everybody kept running off the ball and closing 
people down. You can't do that unless you all do it together." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a down side to the victory over the Sidekicks, it was the fourth 
quarter. As usual, the Sockers gave up late goals, forwards Eloy Salgado and 
Tatu scoring in the final seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think late in the game we lose direction," Crow said. "Not everybody steps 
on the field with the same goals in mind." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers trailed early but quickly recovered. Dallas midfielder Terry 
Woodberry struck 3:55 into the game with a left-footed shot that slipped in to 
the left of goalie Victor Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest of the way it was fun and games for the Sockers (23-19), who now 
are within sight of Baltimore and 4 1/2 games ahead of third-place Dallas 
(21-21). 
</P>
<P>
Brian Quinn, making just his second appearance in two months after being out 
with a strained arch, scored his first goal since Jan. 28, taking a pass from 
Zungul off the wall and crossing it to left corner of the net with 53 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter. That tied the score at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a preview of what Juli Veee can expect to see when he comes 
(tonight)," Quinn said. The Sockers will retire Veee's number at halftime of 
tonight's game with the Los Angeles Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
Zungul put the Sockers ahead to stay with just more than a minute gone in the 
second quarter, sending a shot through the legs of Sidekick defender Kevin 
Smith to make it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Just before halftime, Socker midfielder Paul Dougherty increased the lead to 
3-1, capitalizing on a assist off the wall from Gus Mokalis. Mokalis made the 
pass after Woodberry took a roundhouse swing and a miss at the ball with his 
right foot and landed on his south side on the right corner of the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers are expected to sign Otto Orf II, a goalie from the Fort Wayne 
Flames of the American Indoor Soccer Assn., to a 10-day contract this week if 
he passes his physical. Orf leads the AISA with a 3.56 goals-against average. 
He just completed his fourth season in the league and has two years of 
experience in the Canadian National Soccer League. . . . Jose Luis Rebay, a 
midfielder from Argentina acquired March 14, suited up for the first time 
Saturday. . . . Midfielder Branko Segota, who strained his hamstring March 22 
in a 5-4 loss to Wichita, will not play tonight against the Lazers. . . . 
Socker defender George Fernandez scored his first point since Feb. 19 Saturday 
when he assisted Steve Zungul's second-quarter goal. . . . Midfielder Paul 
Dougherty, who scored in the second quarter Saturday, has six goals in the past 
three games.

MUSTER MAY MISS SIX MONTHS WITH LIGAMENT INJURIES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Muster got a massage. He drank a beer. He was exhilarated because he had 
just scored a five-set victory over Yannick Noah that could elevate him to a 
world ranking in the top 10. No matter what would happen in the final against 
Ivan Lendl, the 21-year-old Austrian had already assured himself of $55,050, 
the biggest earning of his career. 
</P>
<P>
It was nearly midnight, two hours after his Friday night match in the Lipton 
International Players Championships, and Muster was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Muster wanted a sandwich, so he and his coach, Ronnie Lietgeb, and a German 
photographer were driven to a delicatessen in downtown Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Muster got out of the car, which had pulled alongside the curb, and reached 
inside the trunk to get his bag. 
</P>
<P>
Lietgeb didn't see the other car coming straight at them until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
He had no time to shout a warning. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy came straight at us, never braking," Lietgeb said. 
</P>
<P>
As Muster stood behind the trunk, the other car collided head-on with the 
parked car, sending it lurching back and knocking Muster to the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Muster wound up beneath the car, his head near the curb. His rackets were 
crushed under the wheel. Lietgeb was frantic. 
</P>
<P>
"Thomas tried to stand up and he couldn't," Lietgeb said. "I was already very 
scared. I told him to lie down." 
</P>
<P>
This is how Thomas Muster's day ended: Flat on his back beneath a car with both 
of the major ligaments in his left knee torn. 
</P>
<P>
As he was taken to Mercy Hospital in Miami, Muster must have known his year had 
just ended, but how could he have comprehended such a sudden change of fortune? 
Was it so long ago that Muster had come from two sets down to victory? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great moment for us," Lietgeb said. "Unfortunately, it was a short 
celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Muster suffered tears to both the medial collateral and anterior cruciate 
ligaments, according to Dr. Richard Virgin, the former Miami Dolphins team 
physician who examined him early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin was prepared to operate, but could not do it for fear of infection 
during surgery. Too much skin had been scraped away in the accident, Virgin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Muster, wearing a cast that stretched from his left foot to his thigh, talked 
briefly about the injury from his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"It all happened so fast," he said. "I thought I'll never be able to walk 
anymore in my life. I was shocked. I was so shocked and scared, but I thought, 
'Thank God I'm alive.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not angry at what's happened. This is a poor guy who did this. Things like 
this can happen in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I've been thinking about my career. I will probably drop in the 
rankings, but I am still strong and young and there is a good chance to come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported that the other car had struck a second parked car as well as 
a tree when the driver attempted to get away. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver's name and the status of possible charges were 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin termed Muster's injury as "moderate to severe" and suggested that Muster 
may be out of action from six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Lietgeb, who left for Vienna with Muster Saturday night, said surgery may be 
performed within a week after a doctor is selected. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Thomas is really a big fighter, so it is definitely possible he can 
return," Lietgeb said. 
</P>
<P>
With Muster on crutches, Lendl was awarded the title. Lendl, who also won 
$110,100, said in a statement: "I was very surprised to hear what happened and 
I feel very sorry for Thomas. I hope he gets well very soon." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of 76 titles, Lendl also won the 1986 U.S. Pro Indoors in a walkover 
when Tim Mayotte was unable to play after he pulled stomach muscles. 
</P>
<P>
The only walkover in a two-week tennis event occurred in the 1931 Wimbledon 
when Sidney B. Wood Jr. won because American Francis X. Shields could not play 
because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Muster's loss also created a void for tournament chairman Butch Buchholtz, who 
was suddenly without a men's final on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl agreed to play Jakob Hlasek in an exhibition for charity, and Buchholtz 
said there wasn't much else that could have been done. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't anticipate things like this happening," he said. "The odds of it are 
a million to one." 
</P>
<P>
Lietgeb could not help thinking about such odds. A former journalist, Lietgeb 
met Muster, then 15, in a junior tournament and began coaching him two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Muster was a clay court specialist, but he doggedly chased Lendl to four sets 
before losing on the hardcourts in a semifinal at the Australian Open. Ranked 
14th in the world, Muster had a chance to get into the top 10 with his showing 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Lietgeb said rankings do not seem as important as they did when he and Muster 
were laughing and toasting each other in the clubhouse. That was just before 
Muster got hungry.

CHARGERS CLAIM BAHR ON FINAL DAY OF SIGNING UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last day of the signing period for unrestricted free agents claimed the 
Raider kicker for this decade as Chris Bahr signed with the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr, 36, leaves as the No. 2 scorer in Raider history, (817 points to George 
Blanda's 863), and was virtually automatic inside the 30. 
</P>
<P>
However, he struggled on longer kicks in the last three seasons (he was 10 for 
21 outside the 30 last season), and the club began giving harder looks to 
outsiders. John Lee was brought in during the last training camp, cut and then 
invited back when Bahr got off to a slow start. The 44-yarder Bahr kicked at 
the end of regulation of the Raiders' overtime victory at Denver was thought to 
have saved his job. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have already reportedly signed another kicker, free agent Jeff 
Jaeger from the Cleveland Browns, although the club hasn't made any 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, run by former Raider official Steve Ortmayer, also signed Raider 
tight end Andy Parker over the weekend. MARK HEISLER

PRESSURES FROM ADORING FANS AND UNFRIENDLY FOES TAKE TOLL ON YOUNG TENNIS 
SENSATION ANDRE AGASSI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a desperate time in American tennis. There was a void at the top. Jimmy 
Connors had gotten old, John McEnroe had gotten married and the rest of the 
world had gotten good. 
</P>
<P>
Then a young talent emerged almost overnight, from Las Vegas, of all places. He 
smoked the ball from the baseline and generated heat in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
There was hope in the land. 
</P>
<P>
But one morning, this wondrous boy awoke to the sounds of silence. His immense 
popularity was suddenly threatened. How, Andre Agassi wondered, did this 
happen? 
</P>
<P>
Agassi recently sat at poolside in Indian Wells, under a March California 
desert sky that is higher than a South American Davis Cup crowd. 
</P>
<P>
He is shirtless and maned. His hair is of the 
"that-oughta-wake-up-the-country-club" variety. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi is not unaware of the stir he causes almost everywhere he appears. 
Hoping no one will notice, bronzed young women in fashionably cut, brightly 
colored bathing suits squirm in their chaises to catch a glimpse of him. The 
men next to them notice. 
</P>
<P>
Shutterbugs, autograph seekers and young children are less shy. Agassi says he 
loves young children. They don't question his motivations. Later this 
afternoon, he will spend almost two hours with a group of underprivileged kids. 
No reporters. No sponsors. No cameras. No appearance fee. 
</P>
<P>
But right now, he has promised time to a reporter, and he is making good on his 
word. He politely tells everyone who approaches they will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Just last year, Agassi was the tennis world's darling. He won six tournaments, 
$822,062 and the hearts of people who didn't know a half-volley from a 
half-nelson. Then he began alienating those who were watching more closely. 
That bothered him, and his performance level began dropping. 
</P>
<P>
In five tournaments this year, he has yet to reach a final. Next weekend, he 
will help carry the United States' hopes into the San Diego Sports Arena in a 
quarterfinal Davis Cup match against a strong French team. 
</P>
<P>
In a Davis Cup match last July in Argentina, Agassi embarrassed veteran Martin 
Jaite by catching (rather than hitting) one of Jaite's good serves. It gave 
Jaite a free game late in a one-sided Agassi victory. Jaite was insulted by the 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Agassi rubbed Paraguayan noses in a 5-0 defeat at a Davis Cup 
match at Ft. Myers, Fla. He made faces at a small group of Paraguayan fans in 
the stands. And when asked to comment on a bloody coup in Paraguay that 
coincided with the matches, Agassi airily said he didn't even know how to spell 
the word "coup." 
</P>
<P>
He insists he has never intended malice toward anyone. And France's Yannick 
Noah, for one, has said Agassi's panache is good for the game. But a growing 
number of people aren't buying any of it. So it is time, Agassi has decided, to 
mend fences. 
</P>
<P>
He begins to talk about what it's like to be 18 years old, a full-time American 
teen-angel and, in the eyes of many, a part-time public devil. He talks about 
the burdens and blessings of being much of his country's immediate tennis 
future and the world's No. 4-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
In four meteoric years, he has gone from No. 618 at the end of 1985 to No. 91 
at the end of 1986 to No. 25 at the end of 1987 to No. 3 at the end of 1988. He 
has attacked his way to the very doorstep of Ivan Lendl, Boris Becker and Mats 
Wilander. Now, he is under a different sort of attack by a growing media 
aggregation that has put him under a microscope and found some flaws. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, Agassi was a typical tennis brat while growing up in Las 
Vegas. What little motivation he lacked, his father supplied. Emmanuel (Mike) 
Agassi boxed for Iran in two separate Olympics more than 35 years after his 
grandparents fled from their native Armenia in the midst of a bloody political 
struggle with the Turks. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Agassi later came to America in 1952. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had two 
daughters, one of whom is married to tennis legend Pancho Gonzales, and two 
sons. Andre is the youngest. Mike Agassi eventually moved his family to Las 
Vegas, where he works as a showroom captain for a large casino on the strip. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi admits his showmanship and desire to entertain on court stem, at 
least partially, from his neon roots. "Tennis to Andre is like a fight," says 
Tom Gorman, the U.S. Davis Cup captain. "Andre's just grown up that way." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody shares Gorman's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of it's a bit of a fake job," says Mark Woodforde, an Australian 
left-hander and the world's 34th-ranked player. "And I don't like fake people." 
</P>
<P>
A recent Sports Illustrated story painted an unflattering portrait of Agassi 
and an even less flattering picture of the people around him. Agassi said he 
didn't read the story. But after he heard the worst parts, an Agassi confidante 
said that Andre told his brother, Phillip, he wanted to quit tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what I said," Agassi confirmed later. 
</P>
<P>
The urge passed. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Agassi's scrutinizers are trying to decide whether his problems 
are simply related to being a teen-aged American in a fishbowl or whether he is 
a genuinely "bad" guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just a period where he's young," says Woodforde, one of Agassi's 
harshest critics. "But I know that when he has lost recently, the person who 
has beaten him has been ecstatic. And it's like a score for everyone else (on 
tour)." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, his Davis Cup teammate, has criticized Agassi for any number of 
things, including Agassi's annoying habit of "tanking" sets when he falls too 
far behind. According to Agassi, McEnroe has never criticized him to his face. 
Would a heart-to-heart be appropriate? 
</P>
<P>
"What can you do?" Agassi says. "I'm not gonna go up to him and say, 'Hey John, 
what do you think about me?' It (the McEnroe carping) is disappointing. Because 
if there's one person in the world that you could find a lot of negative things 
about, I think most people would agree that it's John McEnroe." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Agassi, himself a former satellite tour tennis player, talks of the 
"silence" that frosts the air when Andre walks into the players' locker room at 
a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they shift the subject," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of those (top) players out there thinks he can beat Andre," says 
Phillip, who travels with Agassi full time. "And there are ones out there that 
can. 
</P>
<P>
"But what's frustrating to them is knowing they will never make the splash in 
tennis that Andre has made. You can see that when we walk into the locker room. 
A lot of it is envy. Not a bad type of envy. I think it's a natural type of 
jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these guys have been out here for four or six years, and they can't 
help but think about how all the money they've made in their career won't add 
up to the money Andre's made in the two years he's been on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shelton, who works for the International Management Group, but basically 
serves as Agassi's full-time agent, said: "We aren't worried about Andre's 
financials right now." Described by one national tennis writer as "Mr. No, No, 
No," Shelton takes even more heat than Phillip for shielding Agassi from the 
blizzard of commercial offers, endorsement feelers, lucrative exhibition 
opportunities and interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to say no," Shelton said. "Andre has to have time to rekindle his 
juices." 
</P>
<P>
It's just that "No" gets harder to say by the day. And "No" makes it harder to 
be liked by everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people see me as somebody who claims to do everything right," 
Agassi counters. "All I've ever been concerned with as far as my tennis goes 
and people go is to give them the real me. There's nothing that I've ever 
wanted to hide. And it seems that some people try to turn it into that I'm 
trying to hide things." 
</P>
<P>
The sun continues to beat down. An elderly woman with a German accent 
approaches for a snapshot. Sweetly, Agassi tells her she will have to wait her 
turn. She hovers nearby. "I don't think she realizes how long she's going to 
have to wait," he whispers. 
</P>
<P>
She will have to wait because Agassi is still warming to the subject of all the 
mistakes he has made. He is the first to admit them. But he is not the only one 
in his tight traveling entourage who has committed them. To his credit, he will 
confess to his errors and talk openly about them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still learning," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip said: "Maybe we're a little fast in making statements when we don't 
know what we're talking about. I'll be the first to admit that. But when you're 
in the middle of a whirlpool, you just reach out for anything that's out there. 
You're a feather in the water, being pulled in all directions." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the paying customers loved it when Agassi applauded winning 
shots by his opponents. But then those opponents started pointing out how 
Agassi only clapped for their winners when he was leading. 
</P>
<P>
Last month at the Newsweek Champions Cup, South African Christo van Rensburg 
was hammering Agassi in a first set Agassi would eventually lose. On at least 
two occasions, Agassi applauded when van Rensburg hit shots past him. Agassi 
later won the match. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Robert Seguso, who will be a Davis Cup teammate of Agassi's in 
San Diego, was defaulted in the final set against Agassi and fined heavily for 
complaining bitterly and in vivid language to chair umpire Richard Ings about 
pro-Agassi crowd noise. 
</P>
<P>
But in the quarterfinals, Noah, serving at 40-15 for the first set, forced 
Agassi into hitting a forehand service return that was apparently wide. The 
linesman called the ball out, but the chair umpire overruled. Agassi approached 
the chair, took the microphone and told the crowd of more than 10,000, "Some of 
you might have seen it good, I saw it wide. It would be tough for me to take a 
point if it was out." 
</P>
<P>
In his next tournament, Agassi lost a match in straight sets in the first round 
to West German Carl-Uwe Steeb, ranked No. 96 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's next competitive match will be against either Noah or Henri Leconte in 
Davis Cup at San Diego next Friday. Gorman says he has talked to Agassi about 
his early season losses, and says he is unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to repeat in 1989 the highly successful year he had in 1988 would be 
unrealistic," Gorman said. "Andre realizes that, too." 
</P>
<P>
The sad possibility exists that Agassi may play his best tennis when he is at 
his contentious worst. Against Woodforde in the quarterfinals at Los Angeles 
last September, he was trailing when Woodforde disputed with the umpire over a 
request to replay a point. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi ordered a shocked Woodforde to leave the umpire alone. Woodforde was 
livid, especially when Agassi rallied to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
"There's sort of an unwritten rule that you don't do something like that 
between players," Woodforde said. "You don't just jump in." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Agassi's roommate for three months at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis 
Academy in Florida was Jim Courier, currently ranked 46th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not best friends by any stretch of the imagination," Courier said of 
Agassi. "But we're friends." 
</P>
<P>
Apprised of Woodforde's charges, Courier said: "Personally, I think Andre's 
narrowed down his show." 
</P>
<P>
No one is quite sure what 1989 will bring for Andre Agassi. And, Shelton says, 
"No one is ever too smart. No one is ever too intelligent. And no one ever 
knows it all." Phillip Agassi says, "A calm sea does not make a good sailor." 
</P>
<P>
But already they are making course adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Bollettieri (Andre's coach), Phillip Agassi and Shelton comprise the inner 
corps of Team Agassi. Last month, they added Pat Etcheberry, a former Chilean 
javelin thrower, as a full-time strength, conditioning and nutrition coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I fully believe that the physical fitness part is a major criteria for this 
boy to go up the ladder," Bollettieri said. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing Agassi play in person is little bit like attending a Beatles concert 
during the '60s. Watching the crowd reacting to him is almost as interesting as 
watching him react to the ball. Young girls squeal. Older women sigh. And 
opponents often become invisible. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's fans send about 1,500 pieces of mail a week. One recent batch included 
three separate letters from females that included accompanying pictures of them 
in the nude. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi is more than a little uncomfortable with the offers. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," he says. "If I was a bad boy on the court, and my 
attitude was just a bad boy's attitude, I really think that would make a 
difference. I really think that would give them the foot in the door to have 
things that Playboy would like to write about." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Agassi tells the story about the two uninvited French women, claiming 
to be models, who tried unsuccessfully to get into Andre's Paris hotel room 
during the French Open last year. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip answered the knock and didn't have to be told this wasn't room service, 
even though the two were carrying a bottle of champagne and glasses for four. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden you've got two girls coming up to the room," Phillip says, 
"and, No. 1, you don't know who they are. No. 2, you don't know who put them up 
to it. No. 3, you don't know what photographer is around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Phillip says, "We hardly ever leave the room. And when we do, 
usually nobody knows about it." 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 French Open was where Bollettieri decided that Agassi's strength and 
stamina on the court needed improvement. It became obvious when Wilander swept 
Agassi, 6-0, in the fifth set of the semifinals. That's when Bollettieri began 
recruiting trainer Etcheberry. In turn, Etcheberry began reading everything he 
could find about Agassi and studying his habits. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to figure out what would motivate him," said Etcheberry, who found out 
Agassi already was motivated. But he was not as strong or as flexible as he 
should be, which is why Bollettieri says fans should wait for the 1990s before 
expecting Agassi to become No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to pull back just a tiny bit," Bollettieri said. "Slow down. Keep the 
element of fun." 
</P>
<P>
It's a sensitive issue for Bollettieri. His two most recent Davis Cup proteges 
-- Jimmy Arias and Aaron Krickstein -- did not have full-time trainers. Nor did 
they have very much fun when their careers turned on them. 
</P>
<P>
Arias, 24, turned professional at 15 and finished 1980 ranked No. 272 in the 
world. He jumped to 81 in 1981, 20 in 1982 and 6 in 1983. Then he began sliding 
-- 14 in 1984, 21 in 1985, 48 in 1987 and 106 last year. He has rallied back to 
No. 69 on the latest computer sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, 21, turned professional at 16 and finished that year ranked 94th in 
the world. One year later, he had risen to No. 12. Then he, too, began slipping 
-- 29 in 1985, 26 in 1986 and all the way to 61 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Bollettieri took much of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein's injuries (wrist problems in 1985 and a stress fracture in his foot 
in 1987) are well-documented. And by the end of 1988, he had climbed back to 
No. 15 in the world. He is currently No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Etcheberry's job will be to see to it that Agassi doesn't ever have to climb 
back into anything more taxing than a limo. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's best boyhood friend, Perry Rogers, is a sophomore at Georgetown. It 
was Rogers who Agassi called long distance for an honest opinion after the 
Jaite incident in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
"What did I do wrong?" Agassi asked Rogers after the match. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers says he told him, "You just didn't think it out. You have to put 
yourself in the position of the spectator. There's a line between cute and 
obnoxious. And if you cross it, you can't go back." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers says Agassi is harder on himself than anyone he has ever known. 
</P>
<P>
The first time Agassi knew he wanted to be a professional tennis player was on 
his fourth birthday, when his father arranged for him to "have a hit" with 
Jimmy Connors for five minutes. Connors did it as a favor to Mike Agassi, who 
had strung several of his racquets between matches at Alan King's tennis 
tournament in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember looking at him on the other side of the net and saying, 'Someday, 
that's what I want to be,' " Agassi said. "Not so much Jimmy Connors. But more 
or less a top pro. Because I knew how he could affect me. And there was 
something inside me that was like 'Wow.' It was that feeling of being able to 
affect people. 
</P>
<P>
"My ultimate goal is being somebody who can affect people. If I never reached 
No. 1, I wouldn't feel like I was missing anything. I just know that I've never 
had a better feeling than when I've done something and it affects people in a 
positive way." 
</P>
<P>
So what words does he have for the next Andre Agassi, McEnroe or Connors -- the 
American boy out there somewhere, as yet unidentified, who will one day find 
himself growing older fast under the same microscope? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say, 'Always remember in life, it's important to do things because you 
feel it's right,' " Agassi said. "And,'Don't be concerned about ridicule.' 
That's what I've learned. I can't let those things affect me."

BREAKING SILENCE; 
</P>
<P>
TWO DECADES LATER, GOALBY FINALLY TALKS ABOUT DE VICENZO, 'CLERICAL ERRORS' AND 
THE '68 MASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Roberto de Vicenzo of Argentina will make a rare visit to the United States 
this week to play in the Tradition Seniors golf tournament in Scottsdale, 
Ariz., which coincidentally is being held at the same time as the Masters at 
Augusta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
But you'll have to excuse De Vicenzo if he passes up the chance to drop by 
Augusta, the scene of his worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
It was there 21 years ago that he signed an incorrect scorecard after the 72nd 
hole of the Masters and thereby knocked himself out of a playoff with Bob 
Goalby for one of the most prestigious titles in golf. 
</P>
<P>
Goalby shot a final-round of 66, but De Vicenzo had scorched the famed course 
with a 65. Unfortunately for the 1967 British Open champion, his playing 
partner for the final round, Tommy Aaron, had mistakenly marked a "4" on De 
Vicenzo's scorecard at the 17th hole instead of the birdie three he had 
actually shot. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping a partner's score during tournaments was and still is the accepted 
method of scoring, although adjustments have been made in the wake of the 1968 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
After the round, De Vicenzo did not notice the error and signed the scorecard. 
</P>
<P>
Within 10 minutes, Masters and Augusta officials were highly excited. The 
anxiety level would not have been any higher had Jack Nicklaus teed one up in 
the Augusta banquet room during the awards dinner and let a drive rip toward 
the head table. 
</P>
<P>
First, the officials at the scene quietly discussed the situation. Then, 
although all of them knew and understood perfectly the rule that said a player 
signing for a higher score must keep that score and a player signing for a 
lower score than he actually shot is automatically disqualified, they sought a 
ruling from the king of Augusta, the late Bobby Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was ill and resting in bed in a fairway cottage when the group of 
brightly dressed men pounded on his door. Jones listened to the story and made 
a quick decision: The rule is the rule. There will be no bending of it, 
regardless of the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Back stormed the group of officials to the clubhouse. There, they notified De 
Vicenzo and Goalby of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
De Vicenzo took it well. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's Goalby's fault," he said. "He give me such pressure, I lose my 
brain. I play my best golf. Everything I do is right. But I make two mistakes. 
I hit a hook on the last hole and I signed the wrong scorecard. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for me. I think I go get a drink and go home. We play friendly 
matches in Argentina." 
</P>
<P>
And then came the quote that made him famous, splashed below his face on the 
cover of Sports Illustrated a week later: "I was just a stupid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron took much of the heat for the simple mistake with the numbers. 
Ironically, Aaron had been a mathematics major at the University of Florida, 
which says something about: a) the enormous pressure golfers are subjected to 
at the Masters, or b) the University of Florida's math department. 
</P>
<P>
But De Vicenzo did not blame Aaron. "We are professionals and we should know 
the rules," he said. "It is my fault." 
</P>
<P>
De Vicenzo never again challenged at the Masters. He won a tournament in 
Houston three weeks later, but then faded. He never won another U.S. tournament 
on the regular tour. He does make infrequent stops on the Senior PGA Tour, as 
he will this week in Arizona, and has won three of the senior events since 
joining that tour nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At age 66, he spends most of his time on his sprawling ranch outside Buenos 
Aires. But the memory of a warm and windless and sad day in Georgia has stayed 
with him, according to those who know him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that every time Roberto sees me or hears my name, or hears the name 
Georgia or Masters, he thinks about it," said Goalby, who is also only somewhat 
active on the Senior Tour. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two decades, Goalby was largely ignored in discussions of the 
controversy. When he wasn't ignored, he was ridiculed, called the luckiest 
golfer in the world for having been awarded a Masters championship because of a 
ridiculous clerical error. 
</P>
<P>
And for two decades, the likable Goalby has remained silent about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was given some good advice that same week," Goalby said. "Arnold Palmer and 
Joe Dye of the USGA told me, 'Bob, you might have a tough time dealing with 
this, but the best thing to do is keep your mouth shut. Don't try to defend 
yourself because people won't listen. Don't make a big deal about it and don't 
fight it.' 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what I did. For 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
At times, he said, the emotions he felt about the incident tried to cut through 
him like a bad slice. 
</P>
<P>
"I listened to that advice and I have never really talked about this with 
anybody," he said. "I never . . . complained to anyone and I have never talked 
to the press about it. But now I'd like to express some of my feelings about 
it. Now I think enough time has passed." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Goalby wanted to clarify was that De Vicenzo's error did not 
cost him the Masters. It only cost him a tie with Goalby for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't exactly shoot an 80 that final round," Goalby pointed out. "I shot 
what was perhaps the finest round of golf in my life that day and earned a tie 
for the Masters championship, even though Roberto was shooting one of the 
finest rounds ever at Augusta. I was feeling very confident about a playoff 
when they told me I had won. 
</P>
<P>
"And all this time, I've always felt like a victim, as much or more than 
Roberto. None of the problems with scorecards were my fault. But I have forever 
been singled out as the guy who won the Masters because of some damn clerical 
mistake. I don't think I ever got credit for what I did that week." 
</P>
<P>
Goalby, 60, won 11 PGA events before joining the Senior Tour in 1980. In 
addition to the Masters, he won the 1961 Los Angeles Open and 1967 San Diego 
Open. But for most people, only that 1968 Masters comes to mind when they hear 
the name Goalby. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, I'm proud of the way I handled the whole thing," he said. "It 
could have been a lot different. I could have said, 'You bastards, you ruined 
the biggest and best day of my life.' But I didn't do that, and I'm glad. I 
held it in for 20 years, and maybe doctors say that's not great for your 
health, but I'm glad I did." 
</P>
<P>
And as long as De Vicenzo makes an occasional visit to the United States, 
Goalby will always remember. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played golf with Roberto many times since that day," he said. "And I 
always thought it was a bit strange, but we have never, ever talked about the 
Masters. I remember it and I'm sure he remembers it. I just see his face and I 
immediately flash right back to that day. I bet he feels the same way. I bet he 
thinks about it more than I do. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have never said a word about it to each other. Not a word."

CHARGERS LAND BAHR, SUPER BOWL HERO SMITH WITH FINAL SIGNINGS

Timmy Smith, who rushed for a record 204 yards in the Washington Redskins' 1988 
Super Bowl victory over Denver, was one of four unrestricted free agents signed 
by the Chargers Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The signings, before Saturday's 9 p.m. deadline, gave the Chargers 11 free 
agent additions. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also signed a former Raider for the second consecutive day, 
grabbing kicker Chris Bahr after acquiring tight end Andy Parker Friday. They 
also picked up former Redskin wide receiver/kick return Eric Yarber and former 
Phoenix Cardinal free safety Lester Lyles. 
</P>
<P>
Smith set the Super Bowl rushing mark on 22 carries and scored twice as the 
Redskins beat the Broncos, 42-10, at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Smith, a 
1987 fifth-round draft choice out to Texas Tech, gained 470 yards and scored 
three touchdowns on 155 carries in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr, 36, leaves as the No. 2 scorer in Raider history, (817 points to George 
Blanda's 863) and rarely missed from inside the 30. He has played 13 seasons in 
the NFL, the past 10 with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
He hit 18 of 29 field goal tries last year. But he has struggled on longer 
kicks in the past three seasons (he was 10 for 21 outside the 30 in 1988), and 
the club began looking harder at outsiders. John Lee was brought in during the 
last training camp, cut and then invited back when Bahr got off to a slow 
start. The 44-yarder Bahr kicked at the end of regulation of the Raiders' 
overtime victory at Denver was thought to have saved his job. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders reportedly have signed another kicker, free agent Jeff Jaeger from 
the Cleveland Browns, although the club hasn't made any announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Yarber spent the past three seasons with the Redskins after being drafted out 
of Idaho in the 12th round in 1986. A knee injury kept him on injured reserve 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles intercepted two passes for the Cardinals last year. He played three 
seasons with the New York Jets after being picked in the second round of the 
1985 draft out of Virginia. He has seven career interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers other free agent signings included tight end Joe Caravello, former 
Ram linebacker Jim Collins, tackle Brett Miller, tackle Joel Patton, defensive 
back Johnny Thomas and guard Larry Williams.

The San Diego Yacht Club will probably appeal a court order to forfeit the 
America's Cup to New Zealand, the president of the America's Cup Organizing 
Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
Malin Burnham, president of the ACOC, said the yacht club board will decide by 
Monday if it wants to proceed with the appeal of New York Supreme Court Justice 
Carmen Ciparick's March 28 ruling awarding the trophy to the Mercury Bay 
Boating Club. 
</P>
<P>
The board of the America's Cup Organizing Committee voted unanimously to 
recommend that the SDYC appeal the court decision.

Jimmy Spencer and Dale Jarrett have been fined by NASCAR and placed on 
probation as the result of an incident during the Busch Grand National stock 
car race March 25 at Hickory, N.C., Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrett, fined $1,000, was leading late in the race when Spencer moved out to 
pass and the cars came together, sending Jarrett into the wall. Spencer, fined 
$2,150, went on to win the race and Jarrett rammed Spencer's car in retaliation 
in Victory Lane.

San Diego's Jess Stayrook won one match in the stepladder final to finish third 
in the $500,000 Seagram's Coolers Open, the richest tournament on the 
Professional Bowlers Assn. tour, at Edmond, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Stayrook defeated Harry Sullins, 226-195, before losing to eventual champion 
Mike Aulby, 234-222, in the next-to-last match. Stayrook earned $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Aulby took advantage of three open frames by Jim Pencak for a 195-178 victory 
in the title game. Ge earned $100,000 for his 17th career PBA title and third 
victory this year. He has won three of his last four tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Aulby has earned $172,985 for the year, a record for the Winter Tour, eclipsing 
Bob Benoit's $155,630 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Aulby grabbed an early lead when Pencak, the top qualifier, missed a single-pin 
spare in the second frame. Pencak fell 22 pins back when he failed to convert a 
split in the third frame. A missed spare by Aulby in the fourth frame got 
Pencak to within five pins, but Aulby then struck on three of his next four 
shots and coasted to the victory.

Freshman Jeff Rouse of Stanford won the 200-yard backstroke as Olympic silver 
medalist David Berkoff of Harvard ended his competitive career by placing 
second Saturday in the men's National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Swimming and 
Diving Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, helped by Shaun Jordan's victory in the 100 freestyle, a first in the 
400-freestyle relay and a second by defending champion Kirk Stackle in the 200 
breaststroke, won the team title for the second consecutive year. The Longhorns 
finished with 475 points. Stanford, which had its string of three consecutive 
titles snapped last year, was second at 396. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan was third with 315, UCLA fourth with 313.5 and USC fifth with 304. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Reese of Texas was selected coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
USC's David Wharton, who swept the two medley events earlier in the meet, 
received the swimmer of the year award for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse, the runner-up to Berkoff when he set an American record in the 100 
backstroke Friday, won in 1:44.87 seconds. Berkoff, who set a world record in 
the preliminaries of the 100-meter backstroke at the Seoul Olympics and won the 
silver medal, finished at 1:45.88. 
</P>
<P>
"The 200 isn't his race," Rouse said. "He's better in the 100, but it does make 
me feel good to beat a world record-holder. I believe I'm a little better at 
the 200 than David Berkoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a sense of where he was, but I never really looked at him." 
</P>
<P>
Rouse made an error on his final turn. "I jammed the wall," he said. "I was 
expected to take another stroke and all of a sudden, the wall was there. . . . 
I misjudged it. That's happened to me before, but it was a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a member of the U.S. Olympic team last year, took the 100 freestyle in 
42.98. USC's Erik Ran of the Netherlands, who was disqualified in two races 
during the meet, was second in 43.08. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Barrowman of Michigan, who set an American record in the 200-meter 
breaststroke at the Olympic trials last year and took fourth at Seoul, won the 
200 breaststroke in 1:55.72 with Stackle, who won the 100 breaststroke Friday, 
second at 1:57.01. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona freshman Mariusz Podkoscielny, a Polish Olympian last year, won the 
NCAA title and was on pace to set a U.S. Open and NCAA mark in the 1,650 
freestyle until the final 50 yards. His winning time of 14:38.09 was 17 seconds 
faster than the runner-up in his heat and just missed the record of 14:37.87 
set by Stanford's Jeff Kostoff in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
John Witchel of Stanford, who swam his heat earlier, placed second in 14:49.69. 
California's Sean Killion, who also raced in an earlier heat, was third in 
14:52.31. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's Melvin Stewart, a freshman who was fifth in the 200-meter butterfly 
at Seoul, won the 200 butterfly in a race in which the top three swimmers 
finished within 0.7 of a second of each other. Stewart finished in 1:44.30. 
Bart Pippenger of Nevada Las Vegas was next in 1:44.60, and Wharton was third 
in 1:44.98. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Methodist's Scott Donnie won the 10-meter platform diving with 757.45 
points. Pat Evans of Cincinnati, who won the three-meter event Friday and 
placed second on the one-meter Thursday, was second at 708.80 and was voted 
diver of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hobie Billingsley, retiring after 31 years at Indiana, tied Cincinnati's 
Charlie Kasuto for diving coach of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
There were several surprises in the preliminaries. USC's Dan Jorgensen, the 
defending champion in the 1,650 freestyle, had a time of 15:09.89 and placed 
14th. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's Brent Lang, who won the 50 freestyle on Thursday, was disqualified 
for a false start when he tried to defend the 100 free championship. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana diver Mark Lenzi, who won the one meter and finished second at three 
meters, withdrew after injuring his wrist on his third dive off the 10-meter 
platform in the preliminaries. Lenzi attempted one more dive before 
withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
The injury was not expected to keep Lenzi out of the indoor national 
championships coming up later this month.

The Bruins outscored the Titans, 193.25-191.85. Defending regional champion 
Oregon State was third with 190.85 points, and Washington was fourth at 187.70. 
Fullerton, which had not advanced to the nationals in two years, also qualified 
for the meet at Athens. 
</P>
<P>
"It was closer than I thought," UCLA Coach Jerry Tomlinson said of Saturday's 
competition. "We trained to do this well. In fact, I feel we should have done 
better. It was not one of our more polished meets, especially the bars." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who will be making their fourth consecutive trip to the nationals, 
held a .55-point advantage over Fullerton after the first rotation. But UCLA 
fell behind the Titans after the second set of scores when the Titans scored 
well on the beam, and UCLA struggled on the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton totaled 96.35 points to UCLA's 96.10. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, certain things needed to happen (for us to contend)," Fullerton 
Coach Lynn Rogers said. "One of them was going five for six on the beam." 
</P>
<P>
Which Fullerton accomplished, placing three in the top five finishers in the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
That pressured UCLA, because the Bruins next rotation was the beam, one of the 
more difficult events. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely critical going into the beam," Tomlinson said. "I was 
worried, only because we were going to the balance beam, and you have to stay 
on (the beam) in order to stay in the running." 
</P>
<P>
Service, who was second in the all-around competition, won the beam with a 
9.90. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have things to work on in the next two weeks," Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton was the all-around champion.

FINDING NEW QUARTERBACK A PRIORITY FOR UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's main objective in spring football practice, which opens Monday and runs 
through April 29, is to find a replacement for Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
"The horses respond best to one jockey," Coach Terry Donahue said. "So, it 
would be nice to establish that leadership element and be able to say (on April 
29), 'This is our quarterback for the 1989 season.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vying for the position will be senior Ron Caragher, junior Bobby San Jose, 
sophomore Jimmy Bonds and redshirt freshman Bret Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all a bit different," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
In what ways? 
</P>
<P>
"Ron Caragher probably has a better overall knowledge and understanding of what 
we've done here offensively," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby San Jose is probably the most athletic, or at least as athletic as any 
of them. He's got nice feet, he's got good mobility, he's got a pretty quick 
release. He's got a lot going for him, physically. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy Bonds has the strongest arm of all four. He puts a lot of heat on the 
ball. And he has leadership ability and charisma. 
</P>
<P>
"Bret Johnson is very elusive, extremely instinctive, has a very good field 
presence and anticipates well. He knows when to unload the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said the competition is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA signed three more quarterbacks in February. "We want to make sure we have 
one," Coach Terry Donahue said. "We're going to have fierce competition and let 
the strongest survive." . . . UCLA will also revamp its defense this spring 
after losing six starters from last year's team, which was 10-2 and defeated 
Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. "We're not as experienced or as deep as we have 
been defensively, but we'll be able to put 11 pretty active, fast players on 
the field," Donahue said. . . . UCLA lost only three offensive starters. . . . 
UCLA's schedule next season includes games in the Rose Bowl against Tennessee, 
Michigan, California, Arizona State, Washington and Oregon and road games 
against San Diego State, Arizona, Oregon State and Stanford. The USC game will 
be played Nov. 18 at the Coliseum.

RACING AT SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
FOR EDDIE DELAHOUSSAYE, IT'S STAKES WINS OR NOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday was the Santa Anita season in microcosm for Eddie Delahoussaye. The 
37-year-old jockey rode the winner of the featured stakes race, but he didn't 
win on his six other mounts. Doing what he does best -- waiting to make a late 
run with a horse -- Delahoussaye brought No Review from eighth lengths behind 
for a 1 1/4-length win over Galunpe in the $218,800 Santa Barbara Handicap 
before a crowd of 32,796. 
</P>
<P>
It was Delahoussaye's 13th stakes win of the season, tying him with Laffit 
Pincay for the lead. But the meeting hasn't been that successful for 
Delahoussaye in other races, as he pointed out after the Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"You like to win those stakes, because those are the ones with the most money," 
Delahoussaye said. "But I haven't been so hot in the other races." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye didn't have to be shown the statistics to know. The hard facts are 
that he's won 13 stakes with 38 mounts, a .342 winning percentage, but he's 
only batting .156 in other races with 54 wins out of 346 tries. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye has won three of the last four stakes at Santa Anita, and the 
Santa Barbara is getting to be one of his favorites. He won the grass race for 
the third time, his second victory coming last year with Pen Bal Lady. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Daily Racing Form, Delahoussaye started the week in third 
place nationally on the money list, behind Pincay and Gary Stevens, and after 
Saturday, Delahoussaye's mounts had earned about $2.6 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay opened up the mount for Delahoussaye on No Review by choosing to ride 
River Memories, who ran seventh in the eight-horse field. Stevens rode 
Delighter, the 5-2 favorite, but she finished fifth after running third most of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Galunpe, ridden by Robbie Davis, who had three wins for the day, finished 1 1/4 
lengths ahead of Annoconnor, the second betting choice who held the lead until 
inside the sixteenth pole, where Galunpe and then No Review passed her. 
</P>
<P>
Timed in a slow 2:02 3/5, No Review earned $128,800 for her owner and breeder, 
Thomas Mellon Evans, and paid $12, $5.40 and $3.40. Galunpe, who was third in 
last year's Santa Barbara, paid $5.60 and $3.80 and Annoconnor paid $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
No Review, a 4-year-old filly by Nodouble out of the Northern Dancer mare, 
Dance Review, started the year on dirt, winning the San Gorgonio Handicap and 
then finishing fourth in the La Canada and third in the Santa Margarita 
Handicap. In her last start, she returned to grass and was fourth in the Santa 
Ana Handicap on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
The win was trainer Chris Speckert's first in a major race. Both the distance 
and the running surface agreed with No Review. 
</P>
<P>
"The last race, I didn't train her too hard because I knew she had to come back 
in two weeks at her ideal distance," Speckert said. "There's no doubt she 
prefers the turf. I only ran her on dirt because there was nothing else to do 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
Flattering News made the early lead, galloping along with Annoconnor in second 
place. No Review was back in sixth place, having recovered after being slightly 
bothered by Belle Poitrine, a horse in distress, on the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
Annoconnor looked as though she could go by Flattering News at will, and on the 
turn, with about a half-mile to go, she did. But Flattering News didn't quit, 
and even in the stretch Annoconnor was hard-pressed to open up some daylight. 
Flattering News finally did tire and finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse got pretty late," Black said of Annoconnor. "She was a little fresh, 
the pace was slow and down the backstretch she went after Flattering News, 
which is something you don't want to do going a mile and a quarter. Maybe she 
doesn't want to run this far, but under the right circumstances I think she 
can." 
</P>
<P>
No Review carried 116 pounds, five less than the top weights, Annoconnor and 
Delighter. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse was going real good until the running started," said Gary Stevens of 
Delighter. "When the running started, the track started getting away from her. 
She didn't handle the turf course. She was bobbling all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Delahoussaye rides Saratoga Passage in the $300,000 San Bernardino 
Handicap. Saratoga Passage couldn't beat Ruhlmann, another San Bernardino 
starter, at Santa Anita on March 5, and Lively One is the high weight and 
pre-race favorite.

CASTLE PARK SPRINTER MOODY NARROWLY WINS FIRST BIG SHOWDOWN IN 100 
</P>

<P>
By JOHN GEIS Baseball Nonleague Escondido 5, Orange Glen 3 -- Gerald Cabral was 
two for four with three RBIs, two in the second inning, for visiting Escondido.

<TEXT>
<P>
After running a hand-timed 10.7 100 meters on a dirt track on Thursday at 
Southwest High, Castle Park's Kiyoshi Moody was looking forward to his first 
sprint on an all-weather surface. 
</P>
<P>
He also was looking forward to running against two of the county's fastest 
sprinters, Orange Glen's Glen Reyes, who ran a 10.7 last Thursday, and Mira 
Mesa's Bobby Nelson, who has run 10.8. 
</P>
<P>
Call it good timing, then, that the Titan Relays came along on Saturday and 
promised Moody an all-weather track, Reyes and Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Moody thought, a chance to run a race in which he would actually be 
challenged and perhaps could push his time lower. Moody said he was "pushed" 
Thursday, but it was really more of a nudge from Southwest's Riley Washington, 
who finished in the mid-11s. 
</P>
<P>
So there Moody was Saturday afternoon, lining up for the invitational 100. 
There already had been one disappointment. Reyes failed to show. 
</P>
<P>
That set up a showdown between Moody and Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson got the early jump as Moody slipped out of the blocks, but when the two 
came within a stride of the tape, they were dead even. 
</P>
<P>
It came down to the lean, and Moody was able to bow his shoulders slightly 
farther than Nelson to eke out the victory a hand-timed 10.95 (the electronic 
timing equipment wasn't working). Nelson finished at 10.99. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I'm disappointed in was the start," Moody said. "The starter 
didn't give me enough time to get set." 
</P>
<P>
Despite being unable to match or beat 10.7, Moody nevertheless came out of the 
race with a smile. He quickly put the 10.95 in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"My best time last year was 10.95," Moody said. "And that didn't come until 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year at this time I was at 11.2 . . . When the Orange Glen Invitational 
comes along (April 15), I hope to be down to 10.7, or 10.6." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get the wrong idea. Moody is not forecasting himself as the section 
champion. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"All year long, it's going to be a battle between Nelson, Reyes and myself," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moody just won the first battle. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the day's times and distances were slow and short, three stood 
out. New South Wales of Australia set a meet record in the girls' 3,200 meter 
relay, running 9:39.4 to beat the 9:43.86 set by Anaheim Esperanza in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' triple jump, Henry's Rachelle Johnson soared 39-feet-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Mira Mesa boys' 400-meter relay finished in 42.9, the only team under 43. 
Don Elder, Nelson, Marshall Evans and Gene Metcalf ran together for only the 
second time this year. 
</P>
<P>
Elder, in fact, was running hard for the first time in three weeks, having just 
recuperated from a left hamstring pull. He ran the opening leg, faltering at 
the start as he slipped out of the blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I took off so hard that the blocks went flying back," Elder said. "And if I 
hadn't slipped up, our time would have been a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
It also would have been faster had the handoff from Evans to Metcalf gone 
smoothly, but Metcalf inadvertently put back the wrong hand to accept the 
baton. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the goof, Metcalf maintained Mira Mesa's lead over second-place Poway 
(43.14). JOHN GEIS Baseball Nonleague Escondido 5, Orange Glen 3 -- Gerald 
Cabral was two for four with three RBIs, two in the second inning, for visiting 
Escondido. Herman Moreno had a double and Shannon Bije two RBIs for Orange Glen 
(7-7). Grossmont 4, Oceanside 1 -- The Pirates (8-5) failed to score in four 
bases-loaded situations and left 15 men on base. John Eichhorst hit a double, a 
single and had one RBI for visiting Grossmont (7-3-1).

AL LUGINBILL SAYS HE'LL BEGIN LEARNING A LOT MORE ABOUT HIS SDSU FOOTBALL TEAM 
WHEN THE HITTING STARTS MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since Al Luginbill became San Diego State football coach in November, he has 
ended his answer to almost every question about his team's personnel with the 
same half-dozen words: "But I haven't seen them in pads." 
</P>
<P>
Starting this week, he will. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill, the 13th football coach in SDSU history, will open his first spring 
practice Monday. By its conclusion with an intrasquad game May 6, he will have 
seen almost his entire team in pads. Only then, he said, will he know more 
about what kind of team he will field when the Aztecs open their season Sept. 2 
at Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what I have seen so far," Luginbill said last week. "But a lot changes 
when you put players in pads. That is when their personalities come out." 
</P>
<P>
And once the hitting begins, Luginbill said, he is looking for one quality more 
than any other. 
</P>
<P>
"I am much more concerned that we play hard on every down regardless of what we 
do X-and-O-wise, regardless of what we do on special teams, regardless of what 
we do defensively, we have to play hard," Luginbill said. "That is what we are 
going to work on every day, and that is what I want more than anything else as 
the head football coach." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he has tried to set that tone since taking over for Denny Stolz, 
who was fired effective at the end of last season one game before a 3-8 finish. 
Luginbill said his staff has worked the players hard in an off-season 
conditioning program and that he has demanded better habits in their athletics 
and academics. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very sensitive to the fact that there is a fine line when you are 
demanding a lot of students both physically and mentally," Luginbill said. 
"We're going to see if they reject it or accept it. We realize we are walking 
that fine line, but this is a program at the crossroads." 
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the players have stuck with Luginbill and his staff. Fewer than 
a half dozen have left the program or been suspended for what Luginbill said 
were academic reasons since he took over. 
</P>
<P>
Several other have been placed on a shape-up program designed to shed what 
Luginbill said were excess pounds that helped make the Aztecs an 
out-of-condition team. Primary among those were Joe Heinz, a 6-foot-3 freshman 
offensive tackle from Chula Vista High School, who has gone from 334 pounds to 
260 since mid-December, according to Luginbill. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a mass exodus," Luginbill said. "These are neat, fun kids to be 
around. That's the biggest thing for me: That they are a fun group. They many 
times might question where I am coming from, but now I think they are about to 
see clearly what I am after." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Luginbill will be doing more this spring than setting the tone for his 
team; he will be looking to install new defensive and offensive schemes. The 
Aztecs have switched to a one-back offense and a four-man defensive front after 
playing a two-back offense and a three-man front under Stolz. Finding the right 
players for those schemes will be much of what the next five weeks are about. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent opening is at quarterback. Senior Brad Platt, the starter 
for the first seven games last season, and sophomore Scott Barrick, the starter 
for the final four games, both return. But they are being challenged by junior 
Dan McGwire, a 6-7 transfer from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill has said that the two quarterbacks who lose out in this competition 
will find themselves behind Cree Morris, an incoming freshman from Orange Glen 
High School, on the depth chart this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs' biggest task might be finding a replacement for tailback Paul 
Hewitt, a two-time 1,000-yard rusher. Senior Ron Slack, junior Tommy Booker and 
freshman Darren Wagner are the main contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Slack is the most experienced but is known more as a pass catcher than runner. 
Booker, who was highly touted coming out of Vista High School, has gained only 
460 yards in two seasons. And Wagner is back at SDSU after a tiff with the 
former coaching staff and a brief transfer to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs also will be looking to find a successor to Kevin Wells, a 
three-year starter at center. Steve Blyth, an offensive lineman who was tried 
on the defensive line last season with little success, has returned to offense 
and is the likely replacement. The rest of the offensive line is back almost 
intact, as are most of the wide receivers, led by senior Monty Gilbreath, whose 
60 catches for 799 yards led the team. 
</P>
<P>
The questions on defense are more numerous and troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU has had one of the worst defenses in the country the past two seasons and 
yielded an average of 34.9 points and 431.5 yards per game in 1988. Eight 
starters return from that 1988 defense, but Luginbill has moved several 
offensive players in an effort to shore up this area. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is not helped by the likely absence from all of spring practice 
of senior Brad Burton, the team's top defensive lineman last season. Burton 
still is recovering from a staph infection in his ankle that kept him out of 
the final four games last season. The best news might be that Luginbill has 14 
players to chose from for the four starting line postions. 
</P>
<P>
The situation at linebacker is of even more concern. Tracy Mao, who started 
most games last season as a freshman, is the most experienced player among a 
group that does not include a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a place on the football team where I wish we had more experience, 
this would be the spot," Luginbill said. "We are not where we want to be at 
linebacker yet. This is a spot where we have to make great strides this 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
The secondary offers more hope with two returning starters, Lyndon Early and 
Clark Moses. But the outlook is changed by the defensive scheme that will 
require the Aztecs to play much of the time with five defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
For all the questions about personnel and schemes this spring, Luginbill 
continued to emphasize that his main theme has more to do with attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have football players who will play hard on every down," he said. 
"That philosophically for me is the whole key to our program for this point on. 
We have to have be known as a group of athletes who are extremely intense all 
the time."

MICHAEL MILKEN, THE MAN; 
</P>
<P>
A GRATEFUL FRIEND DESCRIBES HIM AS COMPASSIONATE AND CARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNARD SALICK, BERNARD SALICK is chairman and chief executive of Beverly 
Hills-based Salick Health Care. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His name and photo seem to be in every newspaper and on every news broadcast 
these days. Yet for all the thousands of words spoken and written about Michael 
Milken, no one has succeeded in providing an accurate picture of the man he is; 
lamentably, few have bothered to try. 
</P>
<P>
I've known Mike Milken since 1982. Over the years, he has shown himself to me 
to be a forthright and honorable businessman and, no less important, a 
sensitive and compassionate human being. I am proud to call him my friend. 
</P>
<P>
What angers me most is seeing this man so largely misunderstood and so harshly 
condemned because he challenged the system and created change in a world too 
often satisfied with complacency. 
</P>
<P>
I believe in Milken's integrity and his courage because I've seen both in 
action. He helped me realize a dream that began as a hideous nightmare when my 
daughter, then six years old, was diagnosed with bone cancer. 
</P>
<P>
My first deal with Milken was completed in May, 1983, when he helped me 
reacquire my dialysis companies and launch my new company, Salick Health Care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Venture 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month later, my family and I received the devastating news of my 
daughter's cancer. The enthusiasm and eagerness that goes along with the 
prospects of exciting new business challenges vanished. 
</P>
<P>
In searching for treatment for my daughter, I traveled across this country and 
got a discouraging personal lesson in the woeful inadequacy of most cancer 
treatment centers. 
</P>
<P>
Convenience to patients and their families was a low priority, treatment was 
available when the health-care facility decided to make it available, and most 
cancer care services were provided in a hospital setting with all the expense 
and inefficiencies associated with such care. 
</P>
<P>
I realized what needed to be done before consciously making the decision to do 
it. There was a desperate need in this country for full-service, 
state-of-the-art, outpatient cancer diagnostic and treatment centers. I wanted 
to fulfill that need. 
</P>
<P>
This was an unprecedented business venture, no one had ever tried it before. 
The start-up costs were staggering. After considering various sources of 
financing, (banks, investment bankers, a public offering, venture capital, 
etc.), I selected a combination leveraged buyout, merger and private placement 
with sophisticated investors. 
</P>
<P>
When I went to Milken with my vision for what I believed had to be the future 
for cancer care treatment, he immediately recognized the need and believed in 
it. He based his decision to raise the funds for my business on my 15-year 
record as a doctor and my reputation as a successful businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Within months of presenting my concept to him, he made it happen. 
</P>
<P>
What does this say about Mike Milken? Consistent with his character, he defies 
convention to support what he believes in. He is not afraid of what does not 
exist or what flies in the face of conventional wisdom. He is challenged by the 
possibility of creating new ventures that fulfill a need and serve the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Desire to See People Succeed 
</P>
<P>
The idea that business supersedes all else in his life at the cost of human 
relationships is absurd. When I would call to discuss our business transaction 
with him, he would allow me to go no further after saying hello until he found 
out about my daughter. (She's now 13, and doing very well.) 
</P>
<P>
When I expressed concern about potential fears of other investors if I were to 
be totally absorbed in a family health crisis, he would brush my concerns 
aside, urging me to concentrate only on my child's health. "Nothing else," he'd 
say, "is nearly as important." 
</P>
<P>
Is this a man whose vision blinds him to everything but money matters? I think 
not. 
</P>
<P>
One of Milken's most extraordinary characteristics is his desire to see people 
succeed in their field of endeavor. When asked, he lends his encouragement and 
guidance whether he is involved with your business or not. He takes pride in 
people's accomplishment. He enjoys seeing -- and helping -- human potential 
become human accomplishment. This is a precious attribute sadly missing in many 
who selfishly hoard success, and all its residual benefits, for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The things I say about Milken are not speculation or hearsay or taken from 
third-party interviews. They are from firsthand experience with a man who 
deserves not ridicule and public debasement but some degree of respect and 
admiration for resuscitating the entrepreneurial and human spirit that should 
be at the heart of the American system of free enterprise.

PUTTING OUR BEST BANKER TO WORK; 
</P>
<P>
IF MILKEN IS CONVICTED OF STOCK FRAUD, THERE IS AT LEAST ONE SUITABLE 
PUNISHMENT FOR THIS FINANCIAL WIZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MAYER, MARTIN MAYER is the author of Markets and other books on 
finance. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his famous review of Salvador Dali's autobiography, George Orwell wrote of 
the need to keep in mind simultaneously Dali's artistic qualities and moral 
squalor. Artists, he said, cannot be "exempt from the moral laws that are 
binding on ordinary people." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment last week of Michael Milken and his departure from the 
investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert costs American finance the 
services of the country's best banker. This is true though the man may well 
have serious character flaws and may be convicted of the crimes with which he 
has been charged. Even for those of us who believe that the "junk bond" 
phenomenon has been on balance harmful to our markets and our economy, Milken 
has been a reminder of the wonders credit can work, the doors an imaginative 
but sound banker can open. 
</P>
<P>
Milken can be called a sound banker for the most traditional of reasons -- 
because he never forgot that loans become good loans only when the borrower 
pays them back. George Moore, the man who built Citicorp in the 1960s, wrote in 
his memoirs that when he was a lending officer at what was then National City 
Bank of New York, he had the nickname of "Three-Way-Out" Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Before Three-Way-Out would recommend a loan, he had to assure himself that if 
the borrower's cash flow turned out to be inadequate to service the loan, it 
could still be paid by cutting back on expansion plans or dividends or, 
ultimately, by selling off assets to repay the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with Moore even today is a lesson in how a railroad keeps track of its 
rolling stock or a department store collects receivables or an airline markets 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, to hear Milken talk about the operations of Stone Container or MCI 
Communications or Mellon Bank is an education in how very dissimilar businesses 
work. 
</P>
<P>
In an age when Wall Street and the most forward-looking commercial bankers know 
nothing but pieces of paper and tricky ways to package them, Milken 
concentrated on understanding what the junk bond issuer does for a living. As a 
result, Drexel to date has the best record of all major underwriters of 
high-yield bonds, looking at the fraction of issuers who have defaulted on 
their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
With Milken out of the picture, and with so many commercial banks aggressively 
in it, we must expect that hunger for yields will be driving out analysis (as 
it did in the pile-up of Third World Debt and land development lending by the 
S&amp;Ls), making our economy's inevitable fall from grace even more painful 
than it would otherwise be. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's initial insight was that the banks and the ratings services were 
denying credit to companies that could in fact pay more than enough money to 
compensate lenders for the extra risks involved in extending them credit. The 
junk bond trade grew out of the long-established business of lending to 
bankrupt companies that had good prospects if they could shrug off their old 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
What made it grow, however, was the use Milken found for it as a source of 
funds for pirates looking to take over corporations that were incompetently run 
or (it made no difference to our impatient markets) had sacrificed current 
earnings to make investments in their future. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the players in takeover games, however, were types you would not care 
to meet on a dark street, and Milken became identified with them. Last spring, 
he said wistfully that he hadn't done any business for two years with Victor 
Posner, Carl Icahn, Boone Pickens or Irwin Jacobs, but people kept regarding 
him as their banker. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the identification was not unreasonable. The uncomfortable fact 
was that Drexel's and Milken's earnings were forever being inflated by profits 
from playing the back-and-forth fluctuations of the market in takeover stocks 
-- fluctuations controlled to no small degree by news stories these fellows 
generated themselves and by unspoken alliances among them. It was understood 
that when Drexel raised money for a raider, some of that money would be 
available to help maintain the price of other Drexel issues. 
</P>
<P>
The corruption of our markets did not start with Ivan Boesky and Milken, 
whatever can be proved, and will not end with them. The vast majority of people 
who work in the securities markets today share Falstaff's view of honor -- that 
it doesn't fill your stomach. The daily abuse of market inside information by 
members of the stock exchanges, which the Securities and Exchange Commission 
has resigned from policing, is cumulatively worse than anything the government 
has charged against Milken. 
</P>
<P>
But the deepest of Milken's troubles appear to derive from an idiosyncratic and 
incomprehensible greed, which hundreds of millions of dollars could not 
satiate. The street is full of stories of Milken taking advantage not of his 
customers or the public (the indictment alleges such conduct in considerable 
detail, but the market is sort of used to that), but of his partners, who found 
deals altered to direct ever larger shares of the profits away from them and to 
Drexel and Milken personally. 
</P>
<P>
The hostility of those Milken made merely rich while he became super-rich is 
the heaviest of the burdens his defense will have to carry. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is entitled to benefit of clergy these days, not evangelists, not 
artists, not financiers. But there are real talents here that the country 
should somehow be able to put to use. Should Milken be convicted or cop a plea, 
there is a punishment to fit the circumstance, if not the crime: a fine of 
whatever dimensions can be negotiated, plus 10 years of community service 
working out the S&amp;L mess. The Bush S&amp;L plan is nothing but an ingenious 
head fake by as insubstantial a bunch of fakers as Washington has seen in years 
-- but Milken has an all-star's capacity to make baskets from head fakes.

On the 98-count indictment of financier and "junk bond" king Michael Milken: 
</P>
<P>
"He's being charged with doing something illegal. He got caught with his 
fingers in the cookie jar. It's marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred L. Hartley, chairman of Unocal, the Los Angeles petroleum company that 
fought off a junk bond-financed takeover attempt in 1985.

<P>
"The public needs to know that rich and poor alike, powerful and powerless, are 
subject to the same prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kirk O. Hanson, a senior lecturer on business ethics at Stanford Graduate 
School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there are any great surprises. They were really shooting for 
these guys, and this is a heavy indictment with a lot of counts." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ira Lee Sorkin, a New York defense lawyer and former regional administrator 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of his problem was that he was too successful. In fact, he became the 
most powerful person on Wall Street since J. P. Morgan." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Riordan, a Los Angeles attorney and venture capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disgraceful and a sad day in American business history the way he's being 
treated. He has given entrepreneurs an opportunity to participate in the great 
American game of business." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charles Sarkis, president of the Westwood Group, which has used junk bonds

</P>
<P>
"The pain of this investigation, and the frustration of knowing it is

DETROIT IS STILL THE CAPITAL OF AMERICAN AUTO DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While General Motors has set up an advanced design studio in Southern 
California, virtually all of its design work on upcoming models going into 
production in the near future is still being performed at its main design 
center, located in GM's sprawling, campus-like technical center in Warren, 
Mich., a Detroit suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Established in September, 1983, GM's Advanced Concepts Center in Thousand Oaks 
instead concentrates primarily on avant-garde design concepts in trends, some 
of which are later incorporated into the designs of cars going into production. 
Most notably, the California studio has designed a prototype Chevrolet Camaro 
that is expected to heavily influence future design of sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
The GM center in Thousand Oaks, now run by longtime GM designer John Schinella, 
is just one of several satellite design studios set up by the major American 
and Japanese auto makers in the region to take advantage of creative trends on 
the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, the basic design work on production cars is still being 
done in Detroit for the Big Three and in Tokyo for the Japanese. JAMES RISEN

THE PUBLIC WOMAN AS HONORARY MAN; 
</P>
<P>
THE WARRIOR QUEENS BY ANTONIA FRASER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $22.95; 383 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margaret Atwood, Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (Doubleday) won the Los 
Angeles Times Book Prize for fiction in 1986. Her most recent novel is Cat's 
Eye (Houghton Mifflin). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Warrior Queens," Antonia Fraser's most recent historical essay, is 
lore-packed, quirky in its approach, and fascinating to read. If nonfiction 
books can be thought of as detailed answers to unvoiced questions, then the 
question answered by this one is: How have female political and military 
leaders gotten away with it? How have they managed to fob themselves off on 
those hardest to convince -- soldiers and other politicians, those 
quintessentially male devisers and players of boys' games -- as worthy leaders 
of the charge or captains of the ship of state, although long of hair and bulgy 
of breast? Such women have been few enough in number so that the exceptions 
have very much proven the rule. But what about those exceptions? What was their 
strategy, their sleight-of-hand? What was their secret? 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of answers, Fraser has assembled a remarkable group of women for our 
contemplation. She begins with Boadicea herself, that famed but shadowy 
1st-Century British tribal queen who led a revolt against the occupying and 
oppressive Romans, massacred a lot of them, and was said to have committed 
suicide when her forces were massacred in return. Fraser provides as faithful 
an account of the events as is possible, given that information is scarce and 
reports vary. But she is just as interested in Boadicea's metamorphoses in 
historical and literary accounts through the ages -- from pious patriot and 
martyr, mother of her people, to unwomanly, bloodthirsty shrew, to symbol of 
heroic British imperialism, ironic in view of the fact that her own revolt was 
against an earlier imperialism. The accounts of her have varied according to 
what men considered proper womanly behavior, and to what the British considered 
proper British behavior; thus Boadicea has been both slut and saint. Very early 
on, the myth detached itself from the real woman in question, and has been 
floating around ever since, ready to stick itself like a leech to any woman 
hardy enough to brandish a spear or declare for office. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser follows up with a varied assortment of women from many centuries and 
civilizations who have held, however briefly, the reins of power: Zenobia, the 
3rd-Century Queen of Palmyra who also challenged Roman rule; Empress Maud, of 
the 12th-Century English wars of succession; Queen Tamara of Georgia, "The Lion 
of the Caucasus"; Elizabeth I, inspiring her troops to battle the Spanish 
Armada; Isabella of Spain; the engaging Queen Jinga of Angola, who successfully 
defied the Portuguese colonists; Catherine the Great of Russia; the Vietnamese 
heroines, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi; the amazing Rani of Jhansi, who fought the 
British in India; Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, and a good many more, concluding 
with that handy bookend to Boadicea, Margaret Thatcher. Their childhoods, their 
paths to leadership, and their styles vary enormously, but they have one thing 
in common: All were instantly mythologized. Male military leaders, taken for 
all in all, have been men, and that has been enough; but female ones cannot be 
mere women. They are aberrations, and as such are thought to partake of the 
supernatural or the monstrous: angels or devils, paragons of chastity or demons 
of lust, Whores of Babylon or Iron Maidens. Sometimes they have profited from 
the female saints or goddesses available to them through their cultures, 
sometimes they have had to work against such images. Their femininity has been 
both shackle and banner. 
</P>
<P>
As leaders, they have had to be, like female doctors a decade ago, better than 
men. They have shamed their male followers by displaying superior courage; they 
have shamed their male adversaries by inflicting defeat on them at the hands of 
a mere woman. They have outmaneuvered, outtalked, outblustered, and in some 
cases outshot and outridden the cream of the male crop. Altogether they are an 
impressive lot, and Fraser is to be congratulated for rescuing them from their 
own myths and for giving them their due as individuals, the lesser-known among 
them as well as the household words. 
</P>
<P>
But although they have been trotted out like a roll call by many advocates for 
the equality of women, and presented in many guises -- from turn-of-the-century 
pageants to Judy Chicago's "Dinner Party" -- these women have seldom allied 
themselves with women in general, or with movements for the improvement of 
their lot. More typically, they have distanced themselves from women, like 
Elizabeth I, who was against female rule but saw herself as a divinely placed 
exception, or like Catherine the Great, who spoke of the "weak, frivolous, 
whining species of women." Many have preferred the status of honorary males. If 
you're playing boys' games, you need to be one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
This book should be required reading for any woman going into politics, 
truck-driving or the Army; indeed, by any woman going into anything, unless her 
chosen field is uniquely feminine. Public women are put through different tests 
of nerve, attract different kinds of criticism, and are subject to different 
sorts of mythologizing than are men, and "The Warrior Queens' " indicates what 
kinds. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us for whom politics is a spectator sport will find it useful, too. It 
goes a long way toward explaining the various media transformations of, for 
instance, Margaret Thatcher, from her Attila-the-Hen period through her 
Iron-Maiden-Falkland-War phase to her incarnation as an editorial-cartoon 
Boadicea, complete with whip and chariot, triumphant on election day and 
dragging a clutch of pygmy men in her wake. Women leaders, it seems, find it 
difficult to be life-sized. For good or ill, they are gigantic.

"Nothing's happening!" a Washington Post-style columnist, Henry Allen, lamented 
in print a few weeks ago. An unsettling calm, he wrote, lies upon America. 
Suddenly, near the end of our tumultuous century, there are no upheavals, 
revolutions, spooky or kooky fads, "Hegelian heroes," romantic Angst, or 
towering passions. We even temper our distress over drugs, Allen wrote, with 
comforting reminders that drug use is no longer spreading. "What happens to a 
society based on change," he asked, "when it begins to suspect there is no 
change?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer to that question is easy: society changes anyway. 
</P>
<P>
If today Americans are refusing to be drawn into a national passion about any 
one issue, I think we will find that this is because we are beginning to absorb 
the first vibrations of a change without precedent in our history -- our 
passage from a young to a middle-aged society. 
</P>
<P>
In this decade, our over-65 population came to outnumber our teen-agers for the 
first time. And two years ago the leading edge of the post-World War II baby 
boom generation (those born between 1946 and 1961) entered its forties. This 
generation, 76 million strong, is one-third of our population today. By 
contrast, the share of the population ages 20 to 29 will drop from today's 18% 
to 13% in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The ramifications of these statistics are the topic of Dr. Ken Dychtwald's 
book, "Age Wave," written with Joe Flower. Dychtwald, a consultant on the 
business and social problems raised by our new demographics, roams the whole 
landscape of modern life to explore the transformation that will be wrought by 
America's becoming middle-age. 
</P>
<P>
Do we instinctively resist the notion of a phenomenon such as the aging of the 
baby boom generation forever altering the way America shops, plays, works and 
loves? Dychtwald demolishes that resistance early on: the boomers, he reminds 
us in his first chapter, are a generational mass that has "dominated American 
culture for four decades." Its profile in our society has been "likened by 
demographers to 'a pig moving through a python.' " 
</P>
<P>
If, on top of the boomers' influence, you add the continuing increase in 
longevity and the still-declining birth rate, the future face of America begins 
to look gloriously wrinkled indeed. 
</P>
<P>
I say "gloriously" because Dychtwald (at 38, himself part of the pig in the 
python) is so upbeat about the outlook and supports his most significant 
assertions with data and research from such competent sources. Here are a few 
items from "Age Wave" that, if you are over 40, ought to make your day: 
</P>
<P>
* "The boomers are the 'youth' generation. . . . In the years to come, entire 
industries will rise and fall in response to this anti-aging, pro-longevity 
obsession." (That should drive up the stock prices of cosmetics firms and drive 
down the cost of their products.) 
</P>
<P>
* "Recent research from the National Institute on Aging suggests that many of 
the problems of old age are not due to aging at all, but rather to improper 
care of the body over a lifetime. . . . What many of us call aging is instead a 
lifestyle issue." 
</P>
<P>
* "The power of older America will snowball. In the 1986 elections, for the 
first time in American history, the oldest group of voters (65 and older) 
outnumbered the youngest group (18-24) . . . voters and politicians may be more 
likely to focus on issues pertaining to the second half of life and less 
focused on concerns of the young." 
</P>
<P>
* "The 60 million Americans over 50 -- one-fourth of the total U.S. population 
-- will turn out to be the most powerful and affluent consumer group in 
American history. (They) currently have a combined personal income of over $800 
billion and control 70% of the total net worth of U.S. households -- nearly $7 
trillion of wealth." 
</P>
<P>
Most interesting to me are Dychtwald's predictions for our future work and 
retirement behavior. "The gift of longevity and the added years it brings will 
cause us to rethink the pace and temper of our lives," he writes. "We will soon 
find ourselves cycling in and out of several different careers throughout our 
lives, each interspersed with periods of rest, recreation, retraining and 
personal reflection." 
</P>
<P>
Some statistics suggest this "cyclic life" scenario, as Dychtwald calls it, and 
I hope he is right -- but I truly wonder if we shall achieve this 
self-actualized nirvana in the lifetime of anyone who is now an adult. And this 
is a weakness (but not a flaw) in Dychtwald's book. More bothersome to me is 
that about halfway through I began to feel I was reading a motivational or 
self-help book. This sadly diluted the impact of the very profound facts he is 
discussing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides fooling observers like Henry Allen into declaring that "nothing is 
happening," the silent inexorability of America's aging has allowed us to 
ignore its likely effects on the vast structure of law, regulation and social 
services that we have constructed in the name of "rights" and "security." 
</P>
<P>
Dychtwald touches on the unhappy potential by noting predictions of 
"intergenerational strife" (as have a scattering of articles in recent 
periodicals), but then he wisely backs off. This is a complicated mine field, 
and he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
I first saw many of the labor force statistics that buttress Dychtwald's 
scenario when I arrived at my desk as U.S. Secretary of Labor in 1987. Two 
studies were waiting for me -- one was "Project 2000" done by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, and the other was the Hudson Institute's "Workforce 2000," a 
private study commissioned by the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the 1988 presidential campaign, some of the facts in those studies 
leaped into the spotlight to advance the "cyclic" scenario: 
</P>
<P>
* Two-thirds of the new entrants to the labor force in the 1990s will be women 
-- making child care, parental and family leave, and flexible workplaces all 
issues; 
</P>
<P>
* A gap is growing between the skills demanded by new jobs and the skills 
possessed by our current and future work force -- making education and training 
an issue; 
</P>
<P>
* The labor force is getting older, growing more slowly, and losing more 
workers to early retirement, presaging labor shortages and more opportunity for 
traditionally disadvantaged groups -- making work availability and preparedness 
for minorities, immigrants and welfare mothers an issue. 
</P>
<P>
But the aging of America, though inseparable from all those issues, did not 
itself become an "issue." Why not? Because "issues" are clear, categorical 
problems that demand "solutions," and how does government "solve" getting 
older? Can candidates debate the march of time? 
</P>
<P>
As one 1988 presidential candidate, former governor Pete Du Pont of Delaware, 
can testify, projections can be difficult to sell in political argument. Du 
Pont, you remember, tried to make the future of Social Security an issue. 
Though he skillfully avoided both scare tactics and sounding like a master 
planner, he could not surmount the fact that the program is secure right now. 
Policy rationales may crumble under pressure, but which ones will they be and 
when will we start to see cracks? We are only beginning to find out. 
</P>
<P>
I would quibble with some of Dychtwald's ideas about our future "lifestyles" (a 
word he uses too often and with too little regard for whether he means behavior 
or values). And I cringed a little at his final chapter which I suspect 
resulted from someone suggesting that he throw in some moral reflections. (I 
find it hard to believe that Monsignor Charles Fahey and the Hobbit "Smaegol" 
in "The Lord of the Rings" have the same concept of an inner life.) But those 
are only irritants in a book that cannot help but provoke wide interest. 
</P>
<P>
At least I hope it will. I really hate the thought of having to keep arguing 
against the idea that "nothing is happening."

<P>
THE ESSENTIAL GESTURE WRITING, POLITICS AND PLACES BY NADINE GORDIMER, EDITED

What does literature do? What is it for? These splendid essays, selected from 
25 years' worth of sharp, firm responses to the particularly grotesque and 
challenging conditions for writers in South Africa, do nothing less than answer 
these huge questions. But they are not bombastic utterances. Nadine Gordimer is 
an unboastful, honest writer who dislikes cant. One of her mentors, cited with 
respectful pleasure, is Turgenev, whose "unpretentious essays," she says, in a 
phrase that can be reapplied to her own work, "make up a remarkable testament 
to a writer's creed." 
</P>
<P>
Her own creed is simple. Politically, it rests on two absolutes: "Racism is 
evil"; "Art is on the side of the oppressed." (If you question the latter, ask 
yourself, she says, "what writer of any literary worth defends fascism, 
totalitarianism, racism?") The writer's job is twofold. He (or she, but 
Gordimer, who has other things on her mind than feminism, always says he) has 
to reconcile his interior, secret, imaginative world with his responsibility to 
what's outside, to history. Through this reconciliation (an especially 
difficult one to make in her country), writing tries to go beyond what has so 
far been "allowed." 
</P>
<P>
When Gordimer played truant from school as a child, she needed, like all 
children, to be told that the world she felt so confined by was not the only 
possible world, that there might be an existence she did not yet know was 
"permissible." That, she insists, is what writing is for: to "explore 
possibilities present but undreamt of in the living of a single life," to 
record "unconfessed history"; in Yeats' words, "to express a life that has 
never found expression." 
</P>
<P>
If writing's job is to permit or express the impermissible and unexpressed, it 
follows that although "censorship may have to do with literature, literature 
has nothing whatever to do with censorship." 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer's life is spent where a conflict over the right of books to be read 
(and written) is built into the writer's life -- as it is still in Eastern 
Europe and in many other parts of the world. In the West, this conflict has 
just been brought home to us in momentous and horrifying form by the 
ayatollah's anathematizing of Salman Rushdie. In the earlier stages of the 
Muslim vendetta against "The Satanic Verses," Rushdie had to cancel a visit to 
South Africa, one of the countries where the book is now banned. Gordimer was 
among those who spoke out strongly against this curtailing of a writer's 
freedom. The case would be close to her heart, since it is the most extreme 
version imaginable of the perpetual opposition between art and orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
That opposition displays similar features in widely variant contexts, whether 
these be Iranian fundamentalism, apartheid, Stalinism, anti-Semitism or the 
militaristic variant of Zionism. In the context in which Gordimer writes, the 
government's efforts, at once ludicrous and malevolent, to ban, raid, censor, 
imprison, exile and silence writers who express alternative versions of history 
to its own, can provide any of them with a South African version of Rushdie's 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
The essays in "The Essential Gesture" are not only about censorship. They range 
widely over politics, literature, travel to other African countries and notable 
individuals. But their essential subject is always the writer's responsibility. 
This makes the book at once a life story and a history of South Africa. Stephen 
Clingman's clear (if a little too hagiographical) commentary places the essays 
in a changing context and points up their interesting connections with 
Gordimer's fiction. So we move from the liberal, optimistic response to events 
like the 1957 Treason Trial of Chief Luthulu and other ANC members, to the 
outrage at the dark acts of the '60s, the Sharpeville killings, the banning of 
the ANC and the trial and life imprisonment of the white Communist Bram 
Fischer, the inspiration for "Burger's Daughter." In the '70s, with the "Soweto 
Revolt," the essays record the "failure of the liberal ideal" and the changing 
relations between white progressives and the Black Consciousness movement. More 
recently, as in her novels, "July's People" and "A Sport of Nature," the 
writing looks, not always hopefully, at the example of other post-colonial 
African countries and anticipates the implications of revolution in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
There is a danger for the writer in being always on the side of the angels. 
Sometimes these essays, speaking of "relevance" and "commitment," edge toward 
the worthily pious. Gordimer is acutely aware of the problems in "conforming to 
an orthodoxy of opposition." The risk is greatest, she sees, for the black 
writer, who is expected to adopt the "kit" of "reliable emotive phrases," 
partly because "agitprop" has been "the first contemporary art form that many 
black South Africans feel they can call their own." But this is a dilemma for 
white writers too. Gordimer knows that nothing she says in her public speeches 
"will be as true as my fiction" and that fiction cannot do the job of speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The perils of belonging too much to an ideology of resistance are set against 
the problems of having nowhere to belong. In many of these essays, Gordimer 
considers, realistically and penetratingly, changing relations between black 
and white writers in South Africa, and the inevitable "double alienation" of a 
writer such as herself, "non-European" and "non-Black." How the white writers 
who stay on in South Africa are to accept their future role as the voices of an 
unwanted and isolated minority is a subject that requires all her honesty and 
firmness of mind. She can only hope that by continuing to say "we" of white and 
black writers, she can endorse the possibility of "a single, common, indigenous 
nature for art in South Africa," not a falsely imposed or fatally divided 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
It is also apparent to her that alienation is (up to a point) not a burden but 
a necessity for the writer. This perception makes her an excellent observer of 
countries where she is made to feel non-existent: "To be white in the streets 
of Accra is to feel oneself curiously anonymous and almost invisible; one is 
aware of one's unimportance, in terms of what a white face has meant and now 
means to people." She records, with wonderful exactness and curiosity, scenes 
from a world where the white view is irrelevant: the night-time halt of a river 
boat in the Congo, gorgeous "ladies of joy" in a Brazzaville open-air cafe, 
lavish erotic designs -- symbols of fertility -- on Malagasy tombs, a picnic 
party of women in full Victorian dress (unchanged descendants of pre-1914 
refugees from Namibia) eating porridge in the Kalahari desert. Throughout her 
travels, Gordimer compares the African states (such as Ghana) that are 
"dedicated to radical change in the life of the masses" and those (such as the 
Ivory Coast) that have fostered a black elite and are dependent on foreign 
investments. In these diagnoses of possible African developments, she takes as 
her motto the messages she spots written up on buses and taxis in Ghana: "It 
changes," and "Merci Dieu." These essays, too, records of a dramatically 
changing history by a tolerant, flexible, adaptive mind, are sermons on that 
text: "Merci Dieu, it changes."

STRIKING TALES OF BLACK FRUSTRATION AND PRIDE SHAKE THE POP MAINSTREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rap music is not polite. It's a noisy 'n' crude attack on mainstream 
sensibilities that has even liberal-minded adults who were raised on the 
rebellious, outlaw beat of Little Richard and the Rolling Stones asking 
themselves, "What happened to real music?" 
</P>
<P>
While these adults shudder at the sound of rap, however, the music is the pulse 
of a far wider urban hip-hop phenomenon -- a glorious, multilayered celebration 
of spontaneous, street-ignited artistry that also includes break dancing, 
graffiti and video. Its energy and flash and style have moved into advertising, 
fashion, and -- of course -- the pop-music mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of rap records to young fans -- black and white -- have become strong 
enough to even make the once-reluctant pop Establishment finally open its doors 
to the black street sound. The Grammy Awards introduced a rap category this 
year, and Billboard magazine followed suit with its own rap sales chart. MTV 
dishes up a weekly rap show, and critics toast the best rap with a fervor 
rarely seen since the arrival of new-wave rock in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the greater acceptance is the arrival of a new wave of rappers, 
such as D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince. They're so wholesome they could 
be regulars on the Cosby show. 
</P>
<P>
But even with this new-found acceptance and poplarity, rap is still criticized 
by some who say that much of the music is socially irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is this outlaw rap more visible than in Los Angeles, where Compton's 
N.W.A has become an explosive new force with tales of gang violence that make 
even some in the rap movement uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
Pushing the imagery much further than anyone before them, N.W.A feature sirens 
and gunshots as backdrops to their brutal and ugly X-rated tales of drug 
dealing, gangbanging and police confrontations. The group's first album, 
"Straight Outta Compton" has sold nearly 500,000 copies in just six weeks, 
while the solo album by N.W.A leader Eazy-E, "Eazy-Duz-It," is nearing the 
650,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Ice-T, a pioneer of the Los Angeles movement who calls his 
management-production company Rhyme Pays, goes out of his way in interviews to 
warn against the gang life style. His records, he has said, show young rap fans 
the consequences of such actions. Ice-T wrote the title track for the 
controversial gang movie of last year, "Colors." 
</P>
<P>
The defiant N.W.A, however, refuses to pass judgment or offer itself as a role 
model. The group's name echoes its bold, incendiary nature: Niggers With 
Attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Sample line from N.W.A's "Gangsta Gangsta": 
</P>
<P>
 Since I was a youth, I smoke weed out 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I'm the ----------- that you read about. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a life or two. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the hell I do 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't like how I'm living, 
</P>
<P>
 Well, ---- you. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a gang and I'm in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice Cube, a 19-year-old who writes most of N.W.A's rhymes, says the extreme 
language isn't just an attempt to shock. It is a reflection of N.W.A's world. 
</P>
<P>
"We make these records for our people first," he said last week. "Words like 
bitch and nigger may be shocking for somebody who is white, but that's not why 
we use them. It's everyday language of people around my neighborhood. When they 
refer to a girl, they might say 'bitch' or when referring to a guy, they might 
say, 'that nigger over there.' It's not used by us the way (bigots) used to use 
it." 
</P>
<P>
About the group's social stance, Ice Cube (real name O'Shay Jackson) added, 
"People say our music inspires violence or whatever, but there has been 
violence since the beginning of time. I like my records to shake people up, 
make them think . . . see something in a new way. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, films like 'Cry Freedom' and 'Mississippi Burning' are from the wrong 
point of view. Hollywood never shows it from the black person's point of view, 
. . . Even in 'Colors,' they showed it from the police point of view instead of 
the gangbangers' point of view. Our stuff is more or less documentary. It's 
what we grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that kids are incapable of knowing what is right and what is 
wrong, but kids are smarter than the adults think they are. They don't have to 
listen to records to know what they should do." 
</P>
<P>
Because of lyrics as explosive as N.W.A's, rap has split the pop community in 
ways that haven't been seen since punk arrived more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a decade now, much of the media and the pop Establishment has been 
hoping that rap would simply fade away. But the music has proved resilient and 
has become a dynamic forum for the expression of black frustrations and 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Oliver, professor of social policy and planning at Cal State Long 
Beach's School of Social Work, sees a connection between rap and the soul 
artists who sang of black pride themes in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"The rappers have gone back to the way Sly and the Family Stone or Curtis 
Mayfield or Donny Hathaway spoke about social conditions in the late '60s and 
early '70s," he said. "They are not only rallying the young rap audience into 
doing something actively about social problems, but also expressing black 
(attitudes) to the larger community. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that made it (attractive) to young people in the beginning 
was that it was a way of relieving some of the anxiety and stresses they felt 
about being rejected by society. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the press early on was fairly negative, but the groups were pretty 
tenacious, and the criticism made them more committed to it. Instead of pushing 
people away, I think it pushed a generation of young people closer together by 
giving them something of their own." 
</P>
<P>
Though the commercial door was opened in 1986, when Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie 
Boys merged rock 'n' rap sensibilities and sold an estimated 7 million albums, 
the real breakthrough has occurred in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 million-plus, Tone Loc's playful "Wild Thing" is the biggest-selling 
single since "We Are the World" in 1985. The L.A. rapper's album is in the 
national Top 10 this week -- one of more than two dozen rap albums to make the 
Billboard pop charts in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
On the critical front, nine rap singles made the year's 25 best records list in 
a Village Voice survey of the nation's pop critics. Equally significantly, 
Public Enemy's political "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back" was 
voted the album of the year by a huge margin. 
</P>
<P>
This turnaround is especially dramatic because rap was first dismissed by white 
rock fans as the enemy -- some strange bastard offspring of disco. Rock radio 
stations resisted it. Even critics outside New York sidestepped it, except for 
an occasional socially conscious record such as Grandmaster Flash's "The 
Message" in 1982 or Run-D.M.C.'s "It's Like That" in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers still look at it with disdain. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ross, who produced and arranged Tone Loc's "Wild Thing" with his partner 
Matt Dyke, considered rap's turnaround and said: "Every time a new phase of 
music comes along, people think it's just a quick trend because they don't 
identify with it. In this case, a lot of white people just saw rap as a bunch 
of black guys screaming. The music wasn't melodic or anything, and it was hard 
for a lot of people to relate to the songs. 
</P>
<P>
"But rap isn't going to just go away. It's not just this year's disco. Disco 
got overexposed, and then the backlash came and boom, it was over. . . . Rap is 
evolving very quickly. The challenge is for the rap artists to keep changing, 
and there are signs now that they are capable of that change." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ross suggests, outsiders may say that rap all sounds the same, but there 
are distinct subdivisions -- from the shocking street realism of Compton's 
Eazy-E and N.W.A to the socially minded activism of Public Enemy and Boogie 
Down Productions; from the girl rap vitality of Wee Papa Girls to the teen 
novelty of D.J. Jazzy Jeff; from the sexy strut of L.L. Cool J to the witty 
pop-culture salutes of De La Soul. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the fast-changing scene, Ross added good-naturedly: "Rap records 
are kind of like Kleenex for the kids. They love the record or a sound for six 
months and then they reach back into the box." 
</P>
<P>
"Rhythmic talking over a funk beat." 
</P>
<P>
That's how David Toop describes rap music in "The Rap Attack" (South End 
Press), his colorful and comprehensive book on the origins of this '80s 
offspring of such equally durable musical forms as the blues and doo-wop. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to 1979 as the start of rap as it is now known, Toop writes that the 
first rap records were "the tip of an iceberg -- under the surface was a 
movement called hip-hop, a Bronx subculture, and beneath that was a vast 
expanse of sources reaching back to West Africa." 
</P>
<P>
For Toop and other rap historians, the roots of the music stretch back through 
a long and surprisingly varied set of characters and movements. Toop's list 
includes more than two dozen cornerstones, from the lively boasts of Bo Diddley 
and Muhammad Ali to street groups and prison songs. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike rock fans, who argue endlessly over the identity of the first true rock 
hit, rap fans generally point to a single record as the key beginning: the 
Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight." 
</P>
<P>
The novelty, released by New Jersey's Sugarhill Records in 1979, only made it 
to No. 36 on the national charts, but it opened a door for other rappers in the 
Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who stepped forward was Joseph Saddler, whose turntable skills 
helped bring a new sophistication to rap. As a kid, Saddler -- who latter 
dubbed himself Grandmaster Flash -- loved music, but records frustrated him. 
Rather than listen to them all the way through like everyone else, Saddler 
picked out the best parts and imagined how they would sound together. 
</P>
<P>
By his mid-teens, he had begun to create his own records by plugging two 
turntables into the same speaker and playing them for neighborhood kids in the 
park. This twin-turntable effect enabled him to switch from one record to the 
other: a 10-second bass line from a James Brown record, a 15-second drum 
explosion from a Chic single, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by what Saddler was doing, other teens got into the act -- either 
dancing to the music or rapping to it. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the success of "Rapper's Delight," Flash and his allies in the Furious 
Five went to Sugarhill Records and released a landmark record in rap. 
</P>
<P>
Hailed as 1982's single of the year by both The Times and the New York Times, 
"The Message" was a stark tale of ghetto alienation that demonstrated that rap 
was not simply an echo of the fluffy disco era. Sample lyrics: "It's like a 
jungle sometimes / It make me wonder / How I keep from going under." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandmaster Flash and the other early rap heroes failed to step forward with 
consistent product or dynamic stage shows, however, and rap remained a rather 
limited black music experience until 1983, when two brothers from Queens 
entered the scene. 
</P>
<P>
There are debates over who has been more important in furthering rap: Russell 
Simmons,who brought marketing and management skills to the virgin field, or his 
brother Joseph, who put together the first superstar rap act, Run-D.M.C. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many of the rap pioneers, they weren't from the Bronx or the ghetto. 
Raised in suburban Queens, they were sons of a supervisor of attendance for the 
New York City school system. 
</P>
<P>
Russell got into rap by producing live rap shows and eventually managing some 
of the better acts, including Kurtis Blow. Today, he runs Def Jam Records -- 
whose acts have included Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and L.L. Cool J -- and 
Rush Management, which represents dozens of rap acts, including Run-D.M.C., 
Public Enemy, Slick Rick and De La Soul. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of resistance to rap in the record business in the beginning, 
but independent labels pushed for it because it was something they could build 
on," Russell said in 1986. "That's how most independents get started. . . . 
With things that major labels don't own or care about." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Simmons was such a natural rapper that he was opening shows promoted by 
his brother while still in his early teens. He eventually put on his own shows 
at the park near his house. While studying mortuary science in college, he 
wrote the song that became another early rap classic, "It's Like That." The 
record, which is in the social-realism tradition of "The Message," sold 500,000 
and pushed Run-D.M.C. into the forefront of rap. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the trio make more consistent albums than their rap rivals, but 
Run-D.M.C. had a greater pop-rock sensibility than its contemporaries. Without 
sacrificing rap's black base, Run-D.M.C. reached out to a white audience that 
had previously ignored rap. The group also adopted a catchy, vaguely 
gangster-like image incorporating black hats and clothing. The idea wasn't to 
make people think they were gangsters. They just thought it looked cool. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the trio's wholesome messages (down with drugs, up with education), the 
gangster image was picked up by the media when violence broke out at a few of 
the group's shows and has remained a cloud over the rap industry. 
</P>
<P>
When 41 fans were injured during an outbreak of gang violence at a Run-D.M.C. 
concert in 1986 at the Long Beach Arena, Joseph Simmons said gang violence had 
nothing to do with rap -- that it was a symptom of larger problems in the city. 
For many Los Angeles residents, that violence indeed was one of the first 
dramatic signs of the extent of the gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Run-D.M.C. -- with assistance from record producer and then Def Jam 
co-owner Rick Rubin -- added a harder edge to its music. A remake of 
Aerosmith's "Walk This Way" broke through to the white rock market in a big 
way. The single -- named record of the year by the Times and the Village Voice 
critics' poll -- reached No. 4 on the pop charts and helped push the trio's 
"Raising Hell" album past the 4 million sales mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Beastie Boys, also working with Rubin, made an even stronger move into the 
rock audience with their album "Licensed to Ill." The collection, which also 
has sold more than 3 million, combined all the styles that parents love to hate 
-- punk, rap and heavy metal -- in a rowdy and irreverent set of songs. They 
had one other quality that helped win white fans for rap: The Beasties are 
white. 
</P>
<P>
Influenced by the success of Run-D.M.C., dozens of other rap artists surfaced. 
Many headed for Simmons' Def Jam Records, while others -- such as the five 
members of N.W.A -- started their own production companies. 
</P>
<P>
Like early rock, rap is inexpensive to record, so acts didn't need the 
financial clout of a major record company to underwrite recording sessions. 
"Wild Thing" was made for under $500. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Heller, a record-industry veteran who over the years has been involved 
with such acts as Elton John and the Electric Light Orchestra, now manages 
N.W.A and Eazy-E, as well as more conventional black acts like Rose Royce. 
</P>
<P>
"The remarkable thing about this scene is that you can make a record for a few 
hundred dollars," Heller said recently at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, 
where his two bands were part of a rap bill that sold out two shows at the 
2,500-seat hall. 
</P>
<P>
"What that means is that you can just throw it away and try something else if 
it doesn't turn out right. It encourages you to try new sounds and experiment. 
It's not like it is at the major labels where you end up spending so much 
making the record, you have to put it out even if it doesn't sound any good." 
</P>
<P>
In the explosion of the late '80s, rap sections of record stores have become 
showcases of records by strange-sounding new groups and labels. Among the 
latter: Delicious Vinyl, Ruthless, Select and Cold Chillin'. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, however, major labels have begun to show up on the rap charts. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' Def Jam -- distributed by Columbia Records -- continues to be the most 
significant label. Its acts range from De La Soul, whose debut album features 
so many delightful pop-culture escapades that it may well be the "Sgt. Pepper" 
of rap, to Public Enemy, whose leader Chuck D has been hailed as the Bob Marley 
of rap. 
</P>
<P>
Though its language can be as forceful at times as N.W.A's, Public Enemy's 
music has a political rather than gangbanger emphasis. The idea isn't so much 
to reflect life on the streets but to raise social awareness and build a 
renewed sense of black determination and pride. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy's politically charged "Yo! Bum Rush the Show" album in 1987 
arrived like an electric jolt. Its aggressive tales of black activism were 
accompanied by a stage act in which the group's aides paraded around with 
imitation Uzis. 
</P>
<P>
When one song urged listeners to pay attention to controversial Black Muslim 
minister Louis Farrakhan and another seemed to condone attacks on police, there 
were concerns about possible anti-Semitism and irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Like Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy leader Chuck D (real name Carlton Ridenhour) 
comes from a middle-class background in the New York suburbs. During his teens, 
his parents sent him to a study program where some of the teachers were former 
Black Panther Party members. The program stressed an intense examination of 
black culture. 
</P>
<P>
While advocating greater black unity, Chuck D made it clear in interviews after 
the release of the album that he wasn't urging racial separation or advocating 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
If "Yo!" seemed chiefly directed at the black rap audience, Public Enemy's 
follow-up, "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back," was addressed 
equally at the new audience of whites that had become interested in rap. 
</P>
<P>
About "It Takes a Nation of Millions," Chuck D said, "I wanted to put together 
a classic album so that years from now it would be looked at the way Marvin 
Gaye's 'What's Going On' or 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' are viewed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are going to see more of that ambition because rappers are 
discovering what it takes to make a really good album. Before, all their 
attention was just into getting a record out there. There were so many things 
working against you. . . . The radio, the record companies." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks of himself more as a record maker or as a social 
commentator, Chuck D sighed, then said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we educate our people as well as entertain them. We have 
to walk that line, not just to our people, but people in general, . . . tell 
others how the black person feels about his situation in America or in the 
Western world. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one reason there is so much confusion over rap. White audiences think 
they are familiar with the black experience, but they aren't. That's why they 
find the language and symbols sometimes shocking. And sometimes they are 
shocking because we are trying to get people's attention. 
</P>
<P>
"When I said Uzis on the first album, I was talking about the power of words, 
but if I had said words, nobody would have thought twice about it. That gave us 
a chance to show them what we were talking about." 
</P>
<P>
One of the challenges, he said, is writing songs that speak equally to black 
and white audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that's one of the most exciting things about what's happening in rap. 
</P>

THE BOOK TRADE: THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF (PAPERBACK) PUBLISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever the global village was on display, it was so during the furor that 
erupted over the publication of Salman Rushdie's "Satanic Verses." Suddenly, it 
was clearer than ever that the world -- not just any one country -- reads 
books. And the world reacts to books. 
</P>
<P>
The Rushdie affair made the timing of Vintage International, an imprint of 
20th-Century classics from around the world, seem almost eerie. The new line of 
paperbacks made its debut March 28 with the simultaneous release of 15 titles. 
Its immediate front-runner in sales was Rushdie's earlier novel "Shame." 
</P>
<P>
A Random House imprint, Vintage International, "was supposed to tie in with 
'Satanic Verses' because we had 'Shame,' " Jeff Stone, the vice president and 
marketing director of Vintage Books, said. "We were prepared" for a reaction, 
Stone said, "but we could never be this prepared." 
</P>
<P>
"The international character of culture is a fact of life in the 20th Century," 
said Erroll McDonald, vice president and executive editor of Vintage. McDonald, 
who is overseeing the launch of Vintage International, has been the U.S. editor 
for Wole Soyinka, the first African to win the Nobel Prize for literature, as 
well as Oscar Arias Sanchez, Edward Said, Manuel Puig and Helmut Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
"Science and technology; music and art; popular culture and fashion; graphic, 
home and industrial design, even cuisine: The development of all has benefited 
from a convergence of international influences," McDonald said. "This has not 
been true of American publishing. For a variety of reasons, American publishing 
has tended to be isolationist." 
</P>
<P>
Vintage International, said McDonald, seeks to "combat the conventional wisdom 
that Americans are at heart xenophobic and that international literature is, 
for the most part, inaccessible and unsalable." 
</P>
<P>
To begin to attain that aim, marketing director Stone took the formula of 
distinctive, highly recognizable packaging that helped boost Vintage 
Contemporaries to success a few years back. Also a trade paperback line, 
Vintage Contemporaries (or "VC" in Random House-speak) served as the literary 
launch pad for Jay McInerney, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Stone spiced up his recipe-for-success by banishing the word "foreign" in favor 
of the loftier term "international." 
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer talking about foreign writers, we are talking about 
international writers," Stone said. "It's like cars. We don't drive foreign 
cars. We drive international cars. We're getting rid of that xenophobia." 
</P>
<P>
The effort to move beyond literary ethnocentrism also provided a vehicle for 
resurrecting a backlist of Vintage authors that Martin Asher, editor in chief 
of Vintage Books, termed "just staggering." A year ago, when Asher came to 
Vintage from the Quality Paperback Book Club, he said he was stunned to 
discover an inventory that included Camus, Mann, Nabokov, Lessing, Primo Levi, 
E. M. Forster, V. S. Naipaul and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Also on the Vintage 
backlist were works by Ford Madox Ford, Amos Oz and Marcel Proust. 
</P>
<P>
By "giving them a cohesiveness as a body of work" offered by a single 
publisher, Asher said Vintage International was "really trying to present them 
to the American public as books rather than as things you had to read in 
school." 
</P>
<P>
It was a matter of "taking them off the backlist and putting them on the 
frontlist," Asher went on. "Bringing these books from the back of the store to 
the front of the store. 
</P>
<P>
"Buyers will see the new line in paperback," Asher says, "and say, 'Oh, it's a 
book now, not an artifact.' We're trying to position these books as books, not 
as furniture" -- i.e., cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Vintage International's aggressive marketing will bring out 56 titles by the 
end of the year, by which time more than 1 million copies of Vintage 
International books are scheduled to be in print. 
</P>
<P>
The primary guideline for each work published in the series is that "it must be 
written by a writer universally acknowledged to be a master of the 20th Century 
or by a major contemporary literary writer whose works have been translated 
into various languages throughout the world," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, though the authors may be famous, the titles are less so. 
Another theory behind the conception of Vintage International is that the big 
names will support less familiar titles, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to weave them all together," said Stone, one of the original 
"longhairs" behind Vintage Contemporaries. "It becomes the ultimate universe." 
</P>
<P>
One difference between VC and the new imprint lies in the age range. The 
Contemporaries targetted an audience that began at about age 20, Stone said. 
The Vintage International series will hope to climb up the age ladder, he said, 
aiming for readers who average between 25 and 45 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
But what pleases Stone and his colleagues most of all is that the minute the 
Vintage International series hit the bookstores here, they began to see a 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"These books are selling!" Stone crowed. "I mean, this is not a public service 
announcement. We are seeing 'Lolita' become a best seller." 
</P>
<P>
TROUT FISHING TURNS 20. At Houghton Mifflin, three books from a decidedly 
American author, Richard Brautigan, have been reissued in a paperback omnibus 
edition that honors their 20th anniversary as separate paperback editions. 
"Trout Fishing in America," "The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster" and 
"In Watermelon Sugar" sold 2 million copies worldwide and made Brautigan an 
instant underground hero after they were released as Seymour Lawrence/Delacorte 
titles two decades ago. Lawrence declared that he had discovered "an American 
original in the tradition of Mark Twain and Ring Lardner" when he reissued the 
books Brautigan had first published in a small press in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Brautigan's works, his friend Tom McGuane said, reflected an author who was 
"crazy with optimism." They were emblematic of the era of Woodstock, Jimi 
Hendrix and Meher Baba, the original don't-worry, be-happy guy. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Brautigan's own center failed to hold. He ran out of money, and 
worse, in his own mind, out of readers. In the fall of 1984 he shot himself at 
his Bolinas retreat. He left no suicide note. But before he ended his life he 
gave his trout fishing rod to his friend McGuane. 
</P>
<P>
ALLELUIA! ALLELUIA! It is no coincidence that this column about paperback books 
appears on this particular Sunday. Easter has come and gone, but this week 
marks the resurrection in Book Review of a paperback best-seller list. This 
list has been absent for more than a year, and while it was on sabbatical it 
had a little format transplant. The old list included 10 mass-market paperback 
titles and five trade-paperback titles. Fiction and nonfiction were not 
divided. In its new incarnation, the paperback best-seller list will include 
seven fiction and seven nonfiction titles. Mass-market and trade-paperback 
titles will not be divided. 
</P>
<P>
The old list was based in part on data from wholesalers and 
other-than-bookstore outlets. The new list, like its weekly cloth cousin here 
in The Times, is based on a poll of local bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
A final transformation: The old paper list appeared weekly. In its new, 
improved edition, it will be published monthly, in conjunction with The Book 
Trade, itself a monthly feature appearing the first Sunday of each month. The 
polling will be done weekly, however. Interested readers may learn Times paper 
(as well as cloth) rankings as early as the Wednesday before the Sunday of 
publication by calling (213) 237-4336 after 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Book Trade, a monthly feature, will next appear May 1, 1989. Next week's 
feature: Bloody Sunday.

DEAD SERIOUS ABOUT AUSSIE CINEMA; 
</P>
<P>
AUSTRALIA'S PHILLIP NOYCE DIRECTS AN ICY THRILLER WITH A RESOURCEFUL HEROINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On screen, it looked so simple. 
</P>
<P>
The scene showed a bridal party parading through a Nevada gambling casino. Off 
screen, an actor dubbing the groom's dialogue leaned into the mike and 
bellowed: "Hey, everybody! I want you to meet my wife -- we're going to get 
married!" 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Noyce groaned. "There's only one problem," he said to the actor. 
"You're already married in this scene. You're going to the reception." 
</P>
<P>
The bluff, rugged-looking 39-year-old Australian film director has been in a 
dark room full of actors all morning, dubbing lines for an upcoming film. 
"Let's personalize it," Noyce said, scribbling new dialogue on a yellow legal 
pad. "Why don't you call your wife Charlene? Actually, that's too close to our 
Colleen character. What's a good just-got-married-in-Reno name. . . . How about 
Mindy?" 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the wonderful world of dubbing (known in industry parlance as 
looping dialogue), perhaps film land's least glamorous pastime. If Noyce finds 
the work dreary, he never lets on. And if he's wary about making his first big 
stateside splash, after years of labor far from the maddening Hollywood crowd, 
he's keeping his nerves to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, three Noyce-directed films will open here, starting 
with "Dead Calm," a ferocious thriller starring Sam Neill, which Warner Bros. 
Films releases Friday. Later this month, art-house patrons can see Noyce's 
"Echoes of Paradise," a romantic drama starring John Lone and Wendy Hughes. And 
by August, Tri-Star will open "Blind Fury," a comic thriller starring Rutger 
Hauer that Noyce was finishing here on the dubbing stage. 
</P>
<P>
The projectionist rolled the casino scene again. When the groom appeared on 
screen, the actor dubbing his lines bellowed: "Here's my wife . . . uh, Marg -- 
no, uh . . . Mindy!" 
</P>
<P>
The room echoed with laughter. "That's OK," Noyce said jovially. "You're 
entitled to forget your wife's name if you've only been married for four 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-4 and a solid 200 pounds, with piercing eyes and chiseled features, 
Noyce is a formidable man with the rugged, resolute gaze of a frontier sheriff. 
Born in a tiny hamlet in New South Wales where his father both farmed and 
practiced law, Noyce grew up with a love for Australia's arid expanses and 
tumultuous history. 
</P>
<P>
While still a teen, he was making experimental films such as "Better to Reign 
in Hell" (nicking the title from Milton's "Paradise Lost"). He's gone on to 
celebrate newsreel cameramen ("Newsfront"), skewer urban developers 
("Heatwave"), critique Aussie treatment of Japanese prisoners of war ("The 
Cowra Breakout") and dramatize the fall of Australia's first Socialist 
government ("The Dismissal"). 
</P>
<P>
Intense and eloquent, Noyce sees the rebirth of Aussie cinema -- and its 
fascination with historical events -- as a symbol of the nation's cultural 
maturity. "When my generation of film makers grew up, all we saw were British 
and American characters -- there was no indigenous film production," he 
explained, relaxing at a house he and his wife keep in Hollywood. "Australia 
suffered from what we called the 'cultural cringe.' The major symptom was that 
any cultural expression was automatically inferior to anything imported from 
England and America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something our generation has tried to change. When we began to make films 
it was only natural that we'd turn to Australian historical occurrences -- and 
examine them from an Australian perspective. I think people really embraced 
them because it was their first chance to see their own culture." 
</P>
<P>
Noyce eyed one of his daughters, who was playing in a nearby room. "Now my 
children think nothing of it -- they've grown up with all these films as their 
history lessons." 
</P>
<P>
An icy thriller, "Dead Calm" is a Hitchcockian tale in the best sense -- it's 
both a taut drama and a gripping lesson in love and personal loyalty. Written 
by Terry Hayes, who scripted the "Mad Max" films, it's based on a book that has 
attracted movie makers before (Orson Welles filmed a never-completed version in 
1968 with Jeanne Moreau and Laurence Harvey). 
</P>
<P>
The story is about an Aussie couple who -- eager to recover from a family 
tragedy -- sail off to the Great Barrier Reef. One day they encounter a 
wild-eyed man frantically fleeing a sinking yacht. After offering a gory tale 
of his escape from death and depravity, he goes below and falls into a deep 
sleep. The husband (Sam Neill) rows off to investigate his story, but just as 
he makes an ominous discovery . . . the man wakes up. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the critical kudos have gone to Nicole Kidman, the 22-year-old actress 
who plays the resourceful young wife who must survive a dangerous liaison with 
her captor (Billy Zane, a co-star of "The Hillside Stranglers" which airs 
tonight. See article on Page 18.). 
</P>
<P>
Noyce calls her character's experience a "rite of passage," saying "she goes 
from weakness to power, from girlhood to womanhood, from loss to re-growth." 
Aussie films have often focused on women, but for American audiences, it's a 
rare treat to see such a psychologically complex female character. 
</P>
<P>
"In Australia we have many female directors -- and lots of strong female 
producers who can get films made," Noyce said. "But our history may have 
something to do with it too. We began as a penal colony. And it's fair to say 
that women were very persecuted -- the first women in Australia were virtually 
slaves, sold by ship captains and male convicts. So I think the Australian 
cinema has spent considerable time and spirit correcting the injustices of 
history -- or at least re-examining it." 
</P>
<P>
On screen, "Dead Calm" lives up to its name -- the ocean ripples with womb-like 
tranquility. Actually, the waters were choppy, making the film a logistical 
nightmare. The production spent nine weeks at sea, filming inside a large reef, 
which broke the huge ocean swells and bordered a nearby island, where the cast 
and crew spent each night. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot some tests in Sydney harbor, but it was so rough that everyone got 
terribly sick," said Noyce. "The actors and crew were all vomiting over the 
side of the boat." 
</P>
<P>
And the director? "Oh, I'm very sea-faring now," he said with a grin. "But I 
wasn't then." 
</P>
<P>
To cope with abrupt ocean weather changes, which could darken the water and sky 
in minutes, Noyce fed his shooting script into a computer system that allowed 
him to match his shots with the brooding scenery. Faced with a stormy day, he 
could instantly find appropriate scenes for cloudy weather. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting on the water was more arduous. "Calm" features several sequences where 
you see three sets of boats at once -- a large schooner, a smaller ketch and a 
tiny dinghy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything looked very simple when we'd storyboarded the scenes," said Noyce. 
"But once we did it for real, on the water. Ughh! It was impossible. We needed 
all three boats lined up for each shot, but the currents would sweep them off. 
Just when we'd get them lined up, the camera boat would have moved 20 feet and 
everything was off again. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn to be a real Buddhist directing a movie on the water. You have to 
find ways to stay calm. You could yell all you wanted, but the sea just 
wouldn't do what it was told." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine Noyce as a brusque set tyrant. In fact, Aussie film 
directors exhibit far more willingness to collaborate than their hot-shot 
Hollywood counterparts. For most of the '80s, Noyce has worked with George 
Miller's Kennedy Miller Productions, which produced the "Mad Max" series, "Dead 
Calm" and many Aussie made-for-TV projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found here in Hollywood that territory is keenly mapped out," said Noyce. 
"One of the founding concepts of Kennedy Miller was to foster film making as an 
organic process in hopes of avoiding so many demarcation disputes. Sometimes 
("Dead Calm" screenwriter) Terry Hayes will look at my storyboards and he'll 
say, 'Oh no, that's not going to work -- you're giving away too much of the 
scene.' It's really a remarkable cross-fertilization process." 
</P>
<P>
This unique tradition emerged from pre-production work on "Dismissal," an early 
Kennedy Miller TV project about the 1975 fall of Australia's first Socialist 
government. Five directors, including Noyce and Miller, worked on the series. 
</P>
<P>
"We split up the story into separate years, with each of us taking a different 
year," Noyce said with a wry grin. "George did the opening segment, so it was 
all we could do to follow his distinctive style and set up the story for the 
next fellow." 
</P>
<P>
Eager to do justice to history, the production team went to great lengths to 
give the story a political symmetry. "We spent a week in an old mansion where 
we figured out a consistent approach to all the political issues. We not only 
studied all the government documents, but we brought in many of the real-life 
participants to hear their views." 
</P>
<P>
All did not go smoothly. "The upshot of our noble efforts was that a week 
before we started shooting, the actors all revolted," Noyce explained. "They'd 
become the custodians of each character in the story. And they saw things a 
different way, so we had to spend two more weeks getting the story straight." 
</P>
<P>
After much tumult, a new Kennedy Miller philosophy emerged. "We decided 
everyone should be involved in the creation of the story. It's become a 
tradition at our company that everyone approaches their job as a storyteller. 
Not just the writer, but the editor, the production designer, the actors and 
the director." 
</P>
<P>
To sharpen his storytelling skills here, Noyce makes frequent trips to his 
neighborhood Hollywood Boulevard movie theater. "You get a fascinating glimpse 
at how an audience really experiences a movie," he said. "I went to see 'Die 
Hard' recently and the response to the killings in the film was just 
incredible. It was as if they saw the murders as therapy, because they're so 
powerless to stop killings in real life. At first I was surprised by how 
bloodthirsty and vocal the audiences were in expressing their urge for 
retribution." 
</P>
<P>
Noyce flashed a thin smile. "I guess you'd have to say audiences today demand a 
faster pace of retribution than the ones I grew up with."

Regarding Chilton Williamson's review of "Destructive Generation" (Book Review, 
March 19). How could you assign Horowitz and Collier's book to a senior editor 
of the National Review for review? That is like asking Roy Cohn to review a 
defense of Joe McCarthy -- there isn't a critical -- in any sense of the word 
-- sentence in the review. Williamson's review is a rehash of the editorial 
page of the Wall Street Journal and the lies of the Bush campaign. Why are 
opponents of racism and the Indochina War "enemies of democracy"? What was more 
"dishonest" -- the actions of small groups in the undefined "left" or the last 
four occupants of the White House? 
</P>
<P>
Did it ever occur to you what interests are served by Horowitz and Collier's 
book or Williamson's review? I'll give you a clue -- Horowitz and Williamson 
are apologists for the Contras, a demonstrable failure of American policy, 
perception, action and strategy. What qualifies apologists for the cruel 
exercise of American state power, no matter how incompetently or at what human 
cost, to write or review a book about those who criticized that power in the 
1960s? 
</P>
<P>
I am disappointed in The Times.

LIVES OF THE 'INTELLECTUALS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just read with disgust your paper's review by Russell Jacoby of Paul 
Johnson's latest book, "Intellectuals" (Book Review, March 19). It is bad 
enough that you chose a literary competitor of Johnson to review his book, 
Jacoby having also written on this topic, but to select a reviewer who could do 
little more than savage a respected historian is despicable. 
</P>
<P>
Jacoby neither reviews the book's content, nor effectively refutes either 
Johnson's premise or his supporting data. Rather, your collegiate reviewer 
seems content to demonstrate an intellectual phenomena which probably 
encouraged the creation of "Intellectuals" in the first place: Hysterical 
intolerance for any thought that is not ideologically collectivist in content, 
sympathy or tone. 
</P>
<P>
It appears to be Jacoby's position that knowledge of these intellectuals' 
personal lives is unnecessary or unfair. Doubtless, Jacoby would advance 
simpatico arguments which would bleat that we should do as such men as Karl 
Marx said, and not as Karl Marx did; and above all, we would probably hear the 
refrain that collectivist ideas are more important than the people upon whom 
they are imposed. Johnson opposes this intellectual trend, and ably points that 
those who would impose their views on society must bear scrutiny of their own 
backgrounds. I say "Bravo" to Paul Johnson for giving us the truth with the 
bark on; all intellectual scoundrels deserve their comeuppance sometime.

ENDPAPERS: REQUIEM FOR AN HONEST MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES BOWDEN, Bowden lives in Tucson where, until recently, he edited a 
monthly called City Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was an easy guy to know because fortunately there were no big moments. And 
he wasn't the guy you imagined from reading his books. A while back, we met in 
this Mexican joint. Marc Gaede, a friend of mine, was in from Los Angeles 
hoping to entice Ed Abbey into writing a preface for his next picture book, and 
he'd brought huge prints of the West as the bait. Over the phone, Abbey had 
been putting Gaede off -- no, by God, he didn't want to be photographed. In 
person, he was, as usual, very soft-spoken and almost shy -- except when he 
laid down his order for a platter of good greasy eggs and some pig meat on the 
side. Things were creeping along -- Marc would set a print on a chair and Ed 
would mumble uh-huh -- until the talk spun off into the technical aspects of 
monkeywrenching. It seems Gaede in an earlier incarnation had once wielded a 
righteous chainsaw in his own highway beautification program. Abbey began to 
drink in all the details, the American novelist busy stealing yet another life. 
Sure, he said, like he'd discovered a long-lost friend, he'd write the preface. 
</P>
<P>
Then Abbey squared off before a small mountain of his books Marc had brought 
and autographed them for Gaede's kids. That done, Abbey insisted on showing off 
his new joy, an old red Cadillac convertible that looked like it had been 
pre-owned by a pimp. I said, "Christ, Ed, you've got no shame." His face 
brightened at such a wonderful thought. 
</P>
<P>
I had lunch with him a week or so before he died at an Abbey kind of place -- 
the air rich with the scent of seared red meat, the tables dotted with coeds. 
As usual, he admonished me to "get out of that silly magazine" (a city rag 
where I toiled at capturing the Angst of the city's overfed and overpaid), and 
to get back into the desert with a pack on my back. And then he shoved forward 
a pile of books I must read -- he always showed up with books he wanted to 
share. He spoke softly and with a slight smile on his face. The enemy of every 
government on Earth, the bogeyman of squads of developers, a man seemingly 
crazed with saving every scrap of wild ground -- well, the same guy laughed a 
lot, and seemed to coast through the day fascinated and amused by the absurdity 
of life, including his own. He was 20 years older than I, but whenever I was 
around him, I was absolutely convinced that he was younger than I ever could 
be. I'd get almost furious because he seemed to be having more fun than I was. 
</P>
<P>
This time lunch was about a novel -- not one he'd written (he never seemed to 
talk about his own work) but one by some guy in Maryland named Bruce Duffy, a 
thick book entitled "The World as I Found It." He pushed it eagerly toward me 
and explained it was about philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, 
G. E. Moore and the Tong wars of early logical positivism. I allowed that it 
all sounded as exciting as having my teeth drilled, but he would have none of 
my objections. By God, he'd written the author a fan letter, and I must read 
the book. And I did, and Ed Abbey was right. 
</P>
<P>
He was not a simple person to consider. He believed the population had to be 
drastically reduced, yet fathered five kids. He was a lifetime member of the 
National Rifle Assn., a onetime Army MP, a man who advocated destroying 
bulldozers to save land, tossed his beer cans out the truck window, and was 
addicted to classical music. He never made a lot of money, he gave 10% of his 
income to enviromental causes, and for years and years he scraped along with 
part-time jobs and kept writing and writing. He hardly seemed to raise his 
voice but had logical, coherent, fierce opinions. He had an anarchist's 
contempt for government and was like a distillate of whatever the word American 
means. 
</P>
<P>
And he could write better than any other man or woman I have ever known. 
</P>
<P>
Many have pointed out these traits, and others, as contradictions. They were 
not. They were Edward Abbey, a bundle of appetites, ideas and delights. Before 
the last local mayoral election he called me up and we had lunch. Ed Abbey had 
decided to run for mayor -- not grunt through a real campaign, but declare for 
the office, and debate the various pawns of the business community running for 
the job. We were sitting down over a plate of machaca when I broke the bad news 
to him. I said, "Ed, you don't live in the city, you live in the county." He 
seemed kind of indignant that such a requirement existed and could stop him 
from his appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I met him I was out at his house to interview a guest of his for 
the local paper. I was leery, kind of like I was disturbing a national 
monument. So I tapped timidly on the door. He opened it up, introduced himself, 
and instantly thrust a copy of my first book into my hands -- a text that had 
fallen dead from press and taken almost 10 years to sell 2,000 copies. He asked 
if I would autograph it and went on and on about its wonders. So he may have 
had pretty bad literary taste, but he was one of the kindest men I have ever 
known. 
</P>
<P>
We became friends. And what we did was, well, we talked about books and ideas, 
mainly. I don't think I ever spent 10 minutes kicking around environmental 
issues with him -- I guess they were simply a given. He worked very hard at his 
writing. An Abbey draft was blitzkrieged with crossed-out words, with clauses 
and sentences moved, and had the general appearance of a bed of writhing 
serpents. Of course, it read like he was talking to you, like he had just 
dashed it off. He wrote so well that a lot of people did not appreciate the 
craft in his work -- you can crack his books open almost anywhere and just 
start reading out loud. But if you start looking closely, you'll find he makes 
every word count, every sentence, every paragrpah. The stuff's as tight as the 
head of a drum. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, what stopped people like myself in their tracks was not simply his 
style, it was his mind. He wasn't just an entertainer, he had ideas to sell, 
and for decades he explored his ideas, refined them, and forced us to snap 
awake and pay attention. Ed Abbey invented the Southwest we live in. He made us 
look at it, and when we looked up again we suddenly saw it through his eyes and 
sensed what he sensed -- we were killing the last good place. His words were 
driven by a moral energy, a biting tongue, and, thank God, by an abundant sense 
of humor, It's pretty hard to read him without laughing. 
</P>
<P>
And he was radical. Want to save the National Parks? Get the stinking cars out. 
Want to keep Arizona beautiful and healthy? Let's make half of it a wilderness. 
Want to bring the Colorado River back to life? Let's blow up Glen Canyon Dam. 
There are damn near 20 books. Read them and see. I suppose his reputation will 
now fall into the claws of the Visigoths of the English departments, and I 
don't know what they'll make of him. But here's what I think: When I'm dead and 
dust, people will still be reading Edward Abbey. Because the stuff he wrote is 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
It's always dangerous to quote Abbey because he tends to blow one's own words 
off the page, but on this writing business, I'll let him have his say: 
</P>
<P>
"That's all I ask of the author. To be a hero, appoint himself a moral leader, 
wanted or not. I believe that words count, that writing matters, that poems, 
essays and novels -- in the long run -- make a difference. If they do not, then 
in the words of my exemplar Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the writer's work is of no 
more importance than the barking of village dogs at night. The hack writer, the 
temporizer, the toady, and the sycophant, the journalistic courtier (and what 
is a courtier but a male courtesan?), all those in the word trade who simply go 
with the flow, who never oppose the rich and powerful, are not better in my 
view than Solzhenitsyn's village dogs. The dogs bark; the caravan moves on." 
(From "A Writer's Credo," in "One Life at a Time, Please" (Henry Holt). 
</P>
<P>
The morning he died, his wife Clarke called me and told me, and I felt like a 
giant hole had been punched in the mind of the Southwest, a kind of new, 
chilling void. And I sensed Tucson and the region had slipped one more rachet 
and lost another piece of its dwindling soul. I realized I was going to be a 
little lonelier for the rest of my life. I don't figure on being lucky enough 
to know another Ed Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
Then I remembered a letter he wrote to the newspapers -- he seemed hardly able 
to get through a day without firing off a broadside to some daily or magazine. 
He suggested that a suitable memorial should be created for a leading local 
developer. He wanted to name the new sewage plant after him. Neither newspaper 
would publish the letter. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I talked to him, he told me how he'd written an essay a year or 
so ago in which he'd noted that nobody in his family ever died. And then, 
suddenly, his brother had died from cancer, his mother had been run over and 
killed by a truck. He looked up at me with a mad twinkle in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
I said, "Maybe you ought to print a retraction." 
</P>
<P>
God, I'm going to miss him. Who in the hell is going to keep us honest? The guy 
we counted on, well, he moved on.

THE GREAT NEW AGE OF CRAIG HUXLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1967, a 13-year-old actor named Craig Hundley was cast as Captain Kirk's 
nephew in an episode of television's "Star Trek." At that time he was plunging 
into dual careers as a TV actor (he won roles in "Kung Fu," "The Flying Nun" 
and "Bewitched") and as a prodigy pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Many years later he returned to the "Star Trek" saga in a very different role; 
now a successful composer in the electronic music field, he supplied some of 
the eerie sounds in the Klingon sequence of the film "Star Trek: the Motion 
Picture." He also worked on the synthesizer programming for parts of "Star Trek 
II" and was involved with the movie series through "Star Trek V." 
</P>
<P>
Today the one-time teen-age whiz, now 35, is at the center of his own musical 
and electronic empire. Now known as Craig Huxley (he wanted to identify with 
the family of philosophers), he owns a $3-million recording studio in Burbank, 
named (what else?) Enterprise. He records his own music and the music of 
countless others who use his studios; he produces and performs during many of 
the sessions, often using instruments he invented. In some cases he releases 
the results on his own New Age label, Sonic Atmospheres, or on his recently 
launched pop label, Sling Shot Records. 
</P>
<P>
During his teen years, Hundley/Huxley was identified with jazz; he even had a 
young trio that played at Shelly's Manne Hole. But at around age 20, he says, 
"I got out of jazz because I couldn't stand what fusion was doing to it. I 
found myself more interested in philosophy, and in electronics and New Age and 
the avant-garde. Then I began inventing and building instruments." 
</P>
<P>
One of his more celebrated inventions, heard during those weird interludes in 
"Star Trek" movies, is the Blaster Beam. Its sounding board resonator, along 
with magnets, strings and an 18-foot aluminum beam, can create some of the 
strangest sounds ever heard. "Some of them," says Huxley, "can be felt rather 
than heard, as they go a whole octave lower than any note on the piano." 
</P>
<P>
Though he still occasionally plays piano, Huxley's world today is populated by 
synclaviers, Yamaha TX816s, Roland Super Jupiters, a Flexitonal Clavichord and, 
of course, the Blaster Beam, all of which can be heard in "Quantum Mechanix," a 
recent album in which he took part as leader, composer, arranger, producer and 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
One of the participants in "Quantum Mechanix" is Hyman Katz, who like Huxley 
has become as much a businessman as a musician; he is now general manager of 
Sonic Atmospheres. He and Huxley jammed together as children. Katz is the son 
of noted cellist Fred Katz, who played in the original Chico Hamilton Quintet. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there in this curious and intriguing CD, along with effects that 
sometimes suggest a latter-day, toned-down counterpart of Weather Report, are 
brief reminders of Huxley's past associations: saxophonists Bud Shank and Bob 
Sheppard are heard on several tracks. For the most part, though, it's 
Spacemaster Huxley who's clearly in charge. 
</P>
<P>
More typical of Huxley's catalogue, which now includes 22 albums (all available 
on CD) are two contributions by Don Harriss, considered one of the masters of 
New Age pop, whose "Elevations," accorded good airplay and respectable sales, 
was followed by "Vanishing Points," which has earned impassioned praise from 
the likes of John Sebastian, who programs for the radio station KTWV, "the 
Wave." Harriss is a virtual one-man band, with his Steinway grand, synclavier, 
Yamaha and Macintosh computer, and with engineer Gary Chase organizing the 
synclavier programming for such Harriss pieces as "Sunlight Samples" and "The 
Rajah's Tea Party." 
</P>
<P>
"With people like Don Harriss, Michael Stearns and L. Subramaniam," says 
Huxley, "we have a great line of albums. What we have to contend with is the 
confusion about categories -- whether this or that album should be classified 
as adult contemporary, AOR (album-oriented rock) or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"After four years of running the company we have a better product. The only 
real hang-up is distribution, which seems to be a harder problem than ever." 
</P>
<P>
But Huxley has enough other irons in the fire to minimize any need to worry 
about the evolution of his label. His studios are in constant use by other 
companies. Answering a phone call the other day, he said: "I'll have to call 
you back -- we're busy in all four studios at the moment. We have the Doobie 
Brothers in one room, Melissa Manchester in a second, Tom Jones in another, and 
the flutist Steve Kujala is making an album in the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Before the dream of building his own studios and record companies became a 
reality, Huxley had a long run as a performer and composer in TV and movies, 
working on countless sessions with Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, James Ingram 
and other pop biggies. 
</P>
<P>
For the movie "Dreamscape" he produced the entire sound track, working with the 
composer Maurice Jarre and programming the synthesizers. (He released the 
"Dreamscape" sound track album on Sonic Atmospheres.) Shortly afterward MGM 
hired him to co-produce the score for "2010," for which he collaborated with 
composer David Shire on a predominantly electronic score. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressures of his multiple operations, Huxley continues to keep his 
hand in as a composer. "I still do 'Knots Landing' about once a month, with 
Jerry Immel as co-composer, and I collaborated with Leon Ware on writing and 
producing 'Undercover,' which was the title number for Leon's album on Sling 
Shot Records."

At present the Sling Shot label is more or less dormant, but Huxley and Katz 
have come up with a third company, Sonic Edge. "We want to use this for 
material that is, so to speak, on the cutting edge of today's developments," 
says Katz -- a surprising statement, since it would hardly seem possible for 
anything to be more contemporary than what can already be found in the Sonic 
Atmosphere lists. 
</P>
<P>
With his studios, his record companies, the composing and arranging and 
inventing and constant search for expansion and innovation, Huxley has 
succeeded in areas far beyond anything that was predicted for him during his 
years as a teen-age piano prodigy and part-time actor. 
</P>
<P>
Today he is a successful businessman, a husband, father of a 2-year-old 
daughter, and, at heart, a musician who has never forgotten the old values. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he said, "I still play Bill Evans tapes in my car."

THE RAP REALITY: TRUTH AND MONEY;

<P>
COMPTON'S N.W.A. CATCHES FIRE WITH STARK PORTRAITS OF GHETTO LIFE

<P>
Eazy-E was rapping about reality the other day, extolling the virtues of 
telling it like it is. 
</P>
<P>
The young Compton rapper, who also runs the rap production company Ruthless 
Records, was lunching with his pal, writer/rapper M.C. Ren, at a Westside deli 
that's one of their favorite dining spots. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you think the fans like us -- why they prefer our street raps over all 
that phony stuff out there?" asked Eazy-E, who has a hit album, "Eazy Duz It." 
He's also a member of the group N.W.A, whose "Straight Outta Compton" is one of 
the hottest rap albums around. 
</P>
<P>
He answered his own question: "Because we're telling the real story of what 
it's like living in places like Compton. We're giving them reality. We're like 
reporters. We give them the truth. People where we come from hear so many lies 
that the truth stands out like a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
Eazy-E, an admitted ex-dope dealer whose real name is Eric Wright, is small, 
surprisingly shy and rather mellow. He certainly doesn't look tough. Neither 
does fellow N.W.A member M.C. Ren (Lorenzo Patterson), who's bigger and more 
talkative. (The other members of N.W.A are Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Yella.) 
</P>
<P>
Continued Eazy-E: "If you're from the streets, one of the fellas from the hood 
(neighborhood), and you hear us, you say, 'Yo, that's real.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Listen to him," said M.C. Ren, who clearly idolizes Eazy-E. "Everybody else 
does. He's real, man, he's real." 
</P>
<P>
Reality is in right now in West Coast rap, with Eazy-E, N.W.A and Ice-T leading 
the way. That means a stark, no-nonsense portrait of ghetto life, where gangs 
and dope pushers rule. (Critics are sharply divided over N.W.A.'s album. See 
Popmeter, Page 82.) 
</P>
<P>
"What Jazzy Jeff and rappers like him talk about is phony stuff," charged M.C. 
Ren, referring to the maker of the cutesy "Parents Just Don't Understand." 
</P>
<P>
"They're not into street raps, into telling what's really happening out there. 
They're talking about what the white world and the white kids can identity 
with. If you're a black kid from the streets and somebody is rapping about 
parents not understanding, you'd laugh at that. You might not have parents or 
you'd have parents that were into crack or prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
Against the odds, both albums have become hits: "Eazy-Duz-It" has sold nearly 
650,000, and N.W.A's "Compton" is nearing sales of 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The rappers have received exposure mainly in clubs and sold records largely by 
word-of-mouth. Now, though, they're going for the mainstream pop market by 
releasing versions of the albums in which the language is cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't this marketing strategy a compromise of their "reality" doctrine? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just business," Eazy-E explained. "We want to sell more records. You 
can't put records in places like K mart and Target if they have explicit 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, a lot of little kids like our music but their parents won't let them 
have records with the cussing on it. And with all the cussing, the records 
won't get played on the radio. So we have a clean version for that. Cussing 
ain't for everybody. They want clean versions, so that's what we'll give them." 
</P>
<P>
Eazy-E says that criminal activities such as dope dealing, car theft, burglary 
bankrolled his entry into the record business. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting too dangerous," he said. "I decided to look for something legal 
to do with the money I'd made." 
</P>
<P>
In late 1986 he started Ruthless Records, a production company that signs 
artists and releases their records through various labels. His solo efforts and 
N.W.A's records are put out by Priority Records, while Ruthless's other prize 
act, female rap trio JJ Fad, is with Atco Records. Ruthless's other artists are 
Bobby Jimmy &amp; the Critters, who are with Priority, and Michele Le, on Atco. 
</P>
<P>
Eazy-E was turned on to rap by hanging out at a Compton club with his rapper 
buddies. Originally, he planned to be strictly a background figure. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to help out rap groups and get in on the business part of the rap 
scene," he said. "But a couple of the acts we wanted backed out, so I decided 
to try rapping myself -- even though I had never done it." 
</P>
<P>
But love of rapping isn't the primary reason he's in this business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not making records for the fun of it; we're in it to make money," Eazy-E 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Eazy-E and N.W.A albums feature some hard-core swearing. 
</P>
<P>
In defense of their seamy street language, Eazy-E said: "If you want to get 
your point across, you gotta cuss." 
</P>
<P>
X-rated street raps, M.C. Ren added, are very macho. "When you're riding around 
with the fellas, you want to listen to something real masculine, like 
'Boyz-in-the-Hood.' How would it look riding around and listening to something 
wimpy like 'I Need Love' or that phony stuff Jazzy Jeff does? Street raps have 
to be masculine." 
</P>
<P>
Women come in for their share of abuse in the raps. Particularly on the N.W.A 
album, women are portrayed as the enemy, as sex objects who are selfish, vain 
and money hungry. Both Eazy-E and M.C. Ren skirted the sexism issue, claiming 
they're not judging women but merely reflecting prevalent ghetto attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not putting down women," Eazy-E said. "It's just street talk. Women 
understand that. They like us. They buy our records. They don't think of us as 
bad guys. . . . That's just how you talk about women." 
</P>
<P>
Although they're against anti-drug messages, they don't advocate drug use. "In 
our raps, we don't tell people not to use drugs, " M.C. Ren said. "They're 
gonna do it anyway, whether you tell them or not. People certainly won't stop 
because they hear something on a record. The kids would just laugh at that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Added Eazy-E: "It all goes back to that bottom line -- reality. The kids from 
the streets don't want preaching or messages. They want what they can identify 
with. They want to hear about the reality of their situation, not fairy tales. 
They don't care if it's ugly, they just want reality."

POLICE DON'T GIVE RAPPERS BAD RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles area law enforcement officials are uncomfortable with some of the 
gangbanger sentiments expressed by N.W.A, but don't view the rap group as a 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not very welcome," said Lt. Joe Flores, adjutant to the Compton chief of 
police. "But it's a fad and I don't think it's going to have an adverse effect 
on the community. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department familiar with 
the Compton and South-Central Los Angeles gang situation also saw little reason 
for concern. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're attributing rap music to escalating gang activity, I haven't seen 
it," said Lt. Art Herrera of the Sheriff's Department gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
However, Leon Watkins, head of a private agency that works with parents of 
youths involved with drugs and gangs, believes the music is exploitative of a 
volatile situation and that "nothing good" can come from it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't condone that kind of thing," said Watkins, former regional director of 
the Los Angeles County Probation Department's youth gang services office and 
now head of his own South-Central Los Angeles Family Hotline. "The minds of our 
young people are too impressionable for groups to be coming out with stuff like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins noted that he has been active in bringing such rap acts as Run-D.M.C. 
together with L.A. gang representatives to serve as positive role models. "Most 
of the rap groups I deal with are positive, anti-gang and anti-drugs. But N.W.A 
sounds like it's using the record industry to glamorize crime, and that's a 
hindrance. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Watkins accepts N.W.A's contention that it is just reporting what 
happens on the streets of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're trying to do is sell records, and they're taking a situation 
that's already prevalent and using that frustration to sell records," Watkins 
said. "But when you put certain things to people who are already frustrated, 
that's what I worry about. . . . They've got a volatile situation and they're 
taking advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
And Watkins does not think songs such as "---- Tha Police" can serve as the 
spark to ignite the volatility into something bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"The music won't touch off something violent," he said. "In my experience it's 
not the music, but something like a shooting that sets things off, and then the 
music becomes a battle cry later."

THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO CONTEMPORARY RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUFF MARLOWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fat gold chains, expensive track suits and major-league egos -- once the 
stereotypical trademarks of rap music -- are rumbling in the face of a fresh 
ainflux of creative young rhymers whose styles are as varied as their 
birthplaces. They flaunt humor, intelligence and style without losing a step on 
the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
Here are 10 introductions to what's happening now in rap -- in order of 
preference: 
</P>
<P>
De La Soul's "Three Feet High and Rising" (Tommy Boy) -- This Long Island trio 
launches its self-proclaimed "Daisy Age" with this madcap masterpiece. Throwing 
together samples of early '70s soul, imaginative dance-inducing drum beats and 
even Steely Dan riffs in a kind of psychedelic collage, rhymers Pos and Dove 
deliver smart, sometimes cryptic verses about everything from gardening to sex. 
</P>
<P>
The Jungle Brothers' "Straight Out the Jungle" (Idlers) -- From romance to 
racism, the JB's tell it like it is with a charismatic and suave funkiness. 
"Behind the Bush" is a lush, seductive groove that rivals Marvin Gaye's most 
persuasive efforts and "Black Is Black" discourses on black unity over a 
seriously funky soul beat. 
</P>
<P>
Tone Loc's "Loc'ed After Dark" (Delicious Vinyl) -- Imagine the shock in New 
York: The biggest-selling rap single ever (the irresistibly danceable "Wild 
Thing") comes out of Los Angeles. The follow-up, the equally infectious "Funky 
Cold Medina," is also rocketing up the charts. 
</P>
<P>
Boogie Down Productions' "By All Means Necessary" (Jive/RCA) -- BDP's Chris 
Parker, known as KRS-One "teaches but never preaches," with themes of 
positivity and non-violence. The single "Stop the Violence" initiated a new era 
of community involvement for fellow rappers, and rocked dance floors and 
airwaves throughout urban America, while "My Philosophy" lays down some South 
Bronx-style truths. 
</P>
<P>
Shinehead's "Unity" (Elektra) -- Shinehead was born in Jamaica and bred in the 
Bronx, personifying a newly emerging hip-hop style that blends Caribbean 
"toasting," an early '60s rap predecessor, with New York-style beats. "Who The 
Cap Fits" tips its hat to Bob Marley and "Unity" borrows a chorus section from 
the Beatles' "Come Together." 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy's "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back" (Def 
Jam/Columbia) -- Public Enemy took the rap scene by storm with their radical 
political line and hard-driving beats. Selling hundreds of thousands of records 
with little or no radio airplay, rhymer Chuck D and sidekick Flavor Flav have 
their fingers on the pulse of urban youth, reflecting rage, rhythm and 
discontent. 
</P>
<P>
N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton" (Ruthless) -- This five-man posse from Compton 
spins some shockingly intense tales of life in the "panic zone." Songs like 
"Gangsta Gangsta" and "Dopeman" may make parents squirm, but the group does 
present a steely-eyed vision of reality that's a blast to dance to. 
</P>
<P>
Eric B. &amp; Rakim's "Follow The Leader" (Uni/MCA) -- In terms of pure 
technique, all the rap world looks up to the smoothly sophisticated style of 
Rakim. This latest album finds the two at their best with superbly produced and 
performed selections like "Follow the Leader," "Lyrics of Fury," and "The R." 
</P>
<P>
Gang Starr's "No More Mr. Nice Guy" (Wild Pitch) -- The son of a municipal 
court judge, this New Yorker lays down the law for kids who see rap as "black 
America's radio station." Songs such as "Knowledge," "Positivity," and "Cause 
and Effect" are more concerned with educating and relating than with egos and 
bragging; using hot soul-flavored dance beats and infusions of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The Wee Papa Girls' "The Beat, the Rhyme, the Noise" (Jive/RCA) -- The 
fashionable English duo pioneered the use of disco-style "house" music beats in 
rap with "Heat It Up" and also flaunt reggae, funk, and even acid styles. 
Producer Teddy Riley, who broke acts like Bobby Brown and Keith Sweat, produces 
the girls' rap version of the George Michael hit "Faith," which was a major hit 
overseas. Disco rap? Why not?

DODGERTOWN SPRING TRAINING CENTER EXEMPLIFIES CHANGES OVER YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, Bob Wolf has been a special correspondent for The Times since his 
retirement from the Milwaukee Journal in 1986. In Milwaukee, Wolf began 
covering spring training in 1954. Over the years, he has made the rounds of 
training camps in Florida, Arizona and California. Wolf spent 39 years at the 
Journal, the last 11 as a columnist. He was president of the Baseball Writers 
Assn. of America in 1963.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much has changed in the 35 years since I first covered baseball's spring 
training but that basic attitude of relaxation remains timeless. Baseball 
simply isn't a sport that requires much hard work. 
</P>
<P>
To basketball and football players, a baseball training camp is almost 
laughable. Basketball players probably exert more energy in one scrimmage than 
baseball players do in a week. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that all baseball players ignore the conditioning routines 
of their basketball and football counterparts. Many train as diligently as 
basketball and football players, and those are generally the ones who have long 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
Except for pitchers and catchers, baseball players can get by with a minimum of 
conditioning. Over the years, many managers tried instituting strenuous 
workouts, but their efforts went unappreciated and the routines were soon 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, the Milwaukee Brewers brought in a female aerobics instructor 
to help whip their players in to shape. So many refused to participate and so 
many others refused to extend themselves that the idea soon died. 
</P>
<P>
One former Brewer, however, can look back on the experiment with pleasure. 
Pitcher Moose Haas was so taken with the instructor that he married her. 
</P>
<P>
The relative insignificance of spring exhibitions is not lost on the managers. 
Because strategy is rarely necessary, some managers have been known to leave 
their dugouts before the games are over. 
</P>
<P>
When the late Fred Haney managed the Milwaukee Braves in the '50s -- he later 
was general manager of the original Angels -- he often watched games in 
Bradenton, Fla. from the porch of the clubhouse near the left-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers met the Detroit Tigers in Lakeland, Fla. recently, Tiger 
Manager Sparky Anderson was interviewed by a reporter in mid-game in front of 
the clubhouse near the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
One bit of spring training drudgery in the old days -- lengthy barnstorming 
tours -- has been mercifully eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, teams took tours up to two weeks en route home from their 
training bases. They traveled by train, and lived in Pullman cars while they 
made one- and two-day stands along the way. These junkets were gradually 
shortened, then scrapped. Today, all teams stay at or near their training bases 
at least until the weekend before the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves used to tour the South with the Dodgers, who were based in Brooklyn 
through 1957. Those were the days of segregation, and that meant separate 
seating areas, separate restrooms, even separate drinking fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Because both teams had outstanding black players -- Hall of Famers Jackie 
Robinson, Roy Campanella and Hank Aaron among them -- black fans flocked to the 
games in such cities as Birmingham, Ala., Mobile, Ala., New Orleans and 
Chattanooga, Tenn. There would be empty seats in the white seating areas, but 
some blacks, whose section was overflowing, had to stand. 
</P>
<P>
Segregation extended to housing in training towns. The Braves, for example, had 
to put up their black players at Mrs. Gibson's rooming house in Bradenton 
because the team's hotel wouldn't allow them. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had no such problem. They moved to Dodgertown in 1948, taking over 
an old naval air base, and the barracks on the base housed all 600 players in 
their organization. 
</P>
<P>
Playing exhibition road games also could be complicated for most clubs. Those 
on each coast of Florida made trips to the other coast, and this sometimes 
meant stopping for dinner. If the restaurant didn't give a team a private room, 
the blacks had to stay on the bus and have food brought to them. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers solved this problem, too, by buying an airplane. They transported 
their teams this way for some 20 years before the cost proved prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 18 teams train in Florida, seven in Arizona and one in California -- the 
Angels at Palm Springs. Facilities have come a long way in recent years, and 
the Dodgers have set the pace. 
</P>
<P>
Dodgertown is the prototype, a city within a city, and it's the only privately 
owned training camp in baseball. Its hub is Holman Stadium, named for local 
businessman Bud Holman, who invited the Dodgers to train here after the 
government turned the military base over to the city of Vero Beach at the end 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Adjoining the stadium are three full practice fields and a row of batting 
cages. Nearby is a building that houses major and minor league clubhouses, a 
medical department, a dining room, a recording studio, a photo dark room, a 
Western Union office, a working press room, a Stadium Club lounge, an interview 
room, an equipment room and two laundry rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A 90-unit resort complex stands where the barracks used to be. The Dodger 
offices occupy an administration building that covers 23,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
For recreation, there are two golf courses, an 18-hole layout named Dodger 
Pines and a nine-hole course; a swimming pool, four tennis courts and a theater 
at which the movies change nightly. 
</P>
<P>
Dodgertown even has a citrus grove and a conference center, and 45 people live 
on the perimeter of the 18-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, managers, coaches and scouts in the Dodgers' farm system served 
as ushers and ticket-takers for games at Holman Stadium. Tom Lasorda, the 
Dodgers' manager, scouted for them in the early '60s, and was stationed at one 
of the gates. He greeted everyone who walked past him with the same ebullience 
he is known for today. 
</P>
<P>
Now other clubs are getting into the act, or rather other towns are. With 
attendance double or triple what it was a few years ago, exhibition baseball 
has evolved into such a big tourist attraction that Florida developers have 
been luring teams to resort locales with guarantees of gleaming new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball City, actually part of Haines City, gets the prize for having the 
fanciest spring stadium. The year-old home of the Kansas City Royals is part of 
a baseball-amusement complex owned by publishing giant Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich. 
</P>
<P>
With a parcel such as that waved in front of them, the Royals didn't hesitate 
to leave Fort Myers. Similar offers have induced four other clubs to switch 
Florida bases -- the New York Mets from St. Petersburg to Port S. Lucie, the 
Cincinnati Reds from Tampa to Plant City, the Houston Astros from Cocoa Beach 
to Kissimmee and the Texas Rangers from Pompano Beach to Port Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
Now even the Chicago Cubs, who invariably lead the major leagues in exhibition 
attendance with more than 100,000 fans a year in Mesa, Ariz., are exploring the 
possibility of a move to Florida. Spring training has truly become big 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, most parks had only one clubhouse, so teams playing road games 
usually dressed and took batting practice at home. Now most training bases have 
minor league clubs, so their parks have two adequate clubhouses. 
</P>
<P>
Living quarters have improved not only for the major league players but for the 
minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
Married major leaguers live in apartments or condominiums, the others in the 
best available hotels. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when many teams' major and minor league camps were located in 
different states. When the Braves were at Bradenton, their farmhands trained at 
Myrtle Beach, S.C., then Waycross, Ga., and lived in barracks or dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
Now every minor league complex is in the same town as the main one -- in most 
cases the two are combined -- and the players live in hotels, albeit of the 
economy variety. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda thinks that this type of setup provides added incentive for the team's 
youngsters. He reasons that just seeing the big leaguers serves as an 
inspiration.

This spring, as the first of two Dodger buses pulled away from the clubhouse 
for a road game, Lasorda noticed a group of minor leaguers on an adjacent 
field. They seemed to be watching in awe as the bus went by. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda sprang out of his front-row seat, turned to face the players on the bus 
and said, "Look at those guys over there. You know they'd give their eyeteeth 
to be sitting where you are now. They live for the day when they can wear 
Dodger blue with pride. You guys are already here. I hope you realize how lucky 
you are." 
</P>
<P>
Most baseball players are fans of other sports and other sports teams, and an 
annual highlight of spring training is the clubhouse pool for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball tournament. In many cases, a player will 
sell the team he drew and pay a scalper's price for another. The jockeying for 
position is intense. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more so than the action on the field during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, optimism is obligatory in the spring, yet managers seem to have cut 
back on their repertoires of cliches. By the same token, reporters have grown 
more selective, and many sports editors have instructed their minions to 
dispense with the once inevitable stories about kids who can't miss but 
invariably do. 
</P>
<P>
Although covering spring training is as low key, but it's a lot more 
sophisticated than it used to be.

RANGERS GAINED NOT ONLY RYAN, BUT 21 YEARS' EXPERIENCE

A freak of nature? Not at all. Nolan Ryan is no different from any other 
pitcher who, at 42, throws 95-m.p.h. fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
By all standards, Ryan should have lost his blazer years ago. But here he is, 
ready for his 22nd major league season as a newcomer to the Texas Rangers, and 
he has no idea when he might retire. After all, who quits when he is ahead? 
</P>
<P>
"I've had people call me a freak for several years," Ryan said at the Rangers' 
training complex. "But it wouldn't be my choice of words. I like the term 
unusual, or out of the norm. What they're saying is, yes, I'm not exactly 
ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Making Ryan's longevity doubly remarkable is that he has twice overcome serious 
elbow ailments. He had surgery for bone chips in 1975 and for a torn tendon in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan offers no explanation for his success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as surprised as anybody else," he said. "When you try to project 
longevity, there's no scientific way. All the other power pitchers I've known 
lost their velocity in their mid-'30s or late '30s." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Ryan has done more than just hang around since he broke into the 
major leagues with the New York Mets in 1968. He has pitched a record five 
no-hit games; he is the all-time strikeout leader with 4,775 strike outs in 
4,547 innings. He also holds 39 other major league records. 
</P>
<P>
As great as he has been, though, Ryan was anything but an overnight success. If 
he had been, the Mets, who had picked him in the 10th round of the inaugural 
amateur draft in 1965, might never have traded him. 
</P>
<P>
After four seasons in which Ryan suffered from severe wildness and won only 29 
games, the Mets traded him to the Angels, along with pitcher Don Rose, catcher 
Francisco Estrada and outfielder Leroy Stanton for infielder Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan then found his form. In his first year with the Angels, he won 19 games, 
had a 2.28 earned-run average and won the first of his nine strikeout titles. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so frustrated with the Mets that I wanted to quit," Ryan recounted. "I 
just couldn't get my breaking pitch over. I'd been in their organization seven 
years, and I wasn't making any progress." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan played a small role in the 1969 Miracle Mets who won the World Series. He 
started only 10 games and worked only 89 innings. 
</P>
<P>
How did Ryan overcome his control problem? 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a matter of pitching a lot of innings," he said. "People say, 
'That guy's a thrower. He's got to learn how to pitch.' That's a fallacy. Until 
you get control, you can't be a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen to 18 years ago, I had a reasonable idea how to pitch, but I kept 
getting behind in the count. There wasn't any (one) point in my career when I 
had a turnaround. It was a gradual process." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's sudden emergence suggests otherwise, but a look at the bases-on-balls 
column bears him out. He led the American League in walks six times in his 
first seven years as an Angel, reaching a career high of 204 in 299 innings in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
He also needed complimentary pitches. Ryan's curveball is vastly underrated, 
and his changeup isn't bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me four or five years to develop a curveball," he said. "I didn't 
develop a changeup until the last eight or 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's fastball, however, is not as fast as it ever was. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastest reading ever was 100 (m.p.h.), when I was with the (Houston) 
Astros," he said. "That happened when I was 38 years old, but I'm not that fast 
on a consistent basis now. The radar gun didn't come in until the late '70s, so 
I don't know how hard I threw when I was young. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school (in Alvin, Tex.,), I was probably one of the hardest throwers 
who ever went through Texas baseball. The kids were intimidated, scared. They 
didn't want to get hurt. This was especially true in night games, because the 
lights were so bad. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have good lights in the minor leagues, either, but at least there 
were a few good hitting prospects. A lot of high school teams didn't even have 
any college prospects." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan spent the last nine seasons with the Astros, only 25 miles from his cattle 
ranch at Alvin, but left as a free agent and signed with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that the Rangers were putting together a competitive ballclub," he 
said. "I thought the Astros weren't doing enough to improve their club." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan also was given a better contract by Texas. He made $1.3 million last 
season, and the Astros wanted to cut him to $800,000 or $900,000. The Rangers 
gave him $1.6 million for this year, plus a $200,000 signing bonus, and $1.4 
million for next year with a provision for a $200,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Ryan's five no-hitters, one more than pitched by Sandy Koufax, have 
given him especially fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
"The second one was my best," Ryan said. "I was more overpowering in that game 
than ever before or since. The fifth one was the most meaningful, because I was 
going for the record after being tied with Koufax." 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Ryan also has pitched nine one-hitters, including one last year in 
which Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies ruined his bid for a sixth 
no-hitter with one out in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if any hitter had been particularly tough, Ryan said, "I've faced a lot 
of power guys, but I had as much trouble with a .200 hitter, Mark Belanger. He 
would bunt, or beat out a bleeder to the infield. He even broke up a no-hitter 
one time in the eighth inning." 
</P>
<P>
The only rap against Ryan over the years has been his record, which is 273-253. 
He has been called a .500 pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear that all the time," he said. "A lot of times, I give up a run and it 
costs me a game. Also, I never pitched for clubs that scored a lot of runs." 
</P>
<P>
Because he is no longer a consistent nine-inning pitcher, Ryan was asked if he 
was concerned about the Rangers' lack of an established ace relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I thought about what happened to (former Dodger and Angel) Don Sutton," 
Ryan said. "He wanted to go to Milwaukee because they had Rollie Fingers, and 
as soon as he got there, Fingers blew out his arm." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's favorite ballparks? Dodger Stadium isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy Wrigley Field in Chicago," he said. "It has a lot of charisma when the 
ivy is all leafed out, a lot of nostalgia. Anaheim Stadium was about as pretty 
as any until they closed it in. 
</P>
<P>
"Dodger Stadium is pretty, but I don't like it. It's right in the middle of 
L.A., plus it's got smog, traffic and Tom Lasorda. We always had trouble 
winning there, too, so it could be circumstances more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan recalled that he thought he was signing his last contract when he agreed 
to a three-year deal with the Astros in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 32 at the time, and I didn't see myself pitching beyond 34," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, Ryan remains one of the most overpowering starting pitchers in 
baseball.

NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT: THE FINAL FOUR;

THE FINAL NOBODY EXPECTED;

MICHIGAN BEATS ILLINOIS, 83-81 ON HIGGINS' SHOT

<P>
There were 33 lead changes, but the biggest change of all was for Michigan. The 
Wolverines finally beat Illinois, and they're headed into college basketball's 
national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Higgins took a rebound of a missed three-point attempt with two seconds 
left and scored from short range, giving Michigan an 83-81 victory over 
Illinois in the Final Four semifinal game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory sends Michigan, playing in its first Final Four since 1976, into 
the final against Seton Hall on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was sealed when Glen Rice, Michigan's hottest hand during the 
tournament, intercepted a length-of-the-court inbounds pass by Illinois' Steve 
Bardo as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Rice led the Wolverines with 28 points, three less that his tournament average, 
in a game that was so close in almost every statistical category that the only 
numbers that were different at its end were the scores. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, ranked third in the nation at season's end, had the speed. Michigan, 
ranked 10th, had the size. In two previous Big Ten Conference meetings this 
season, speed had won. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Michigan used a combination of its size advantage, the hot hand of 
Rice, the ball-handling of Rumeal Robinson and the 16 rebounds of center Loy 
Vaught to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands 17 times in the first half, which wound up with Michigan 
holding a 39-38 lead. The biggest lead of the game was eight points, 16-8, on 
two free throws by Illinois' Nick Anderson just 5 1/2 minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan outscored Illinois 12-6 to start the second half, getting six of those 
points from the 6-foot-10 Terry Mills, who is three inches taller than any of 
Illinois' starters. That run gave the Wolverines a seven-point lead, 51-44, 
with 15:35 left. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, however, scored 10 of the game's next 12 points, getting four from 
Lowell Hamilton, to lead 54-53 with 11:26 to play. No more than four points 
separated the two teams the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
For Michigan's interim coach, Steve Fisher, it was the fifth straight victory 
in an undefeated coaching career that began in this tournament. For Illinois' 
Lou Henson, whose career record is 535-249, it must have been a major 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Henson had taken Illinois into the tournament for seven straight years before 
reaching the Final Four, only to lose to a team he had beaten twice during the 
season. His Fighting Illini were even ranked No. 1 for a week in January, but 
now that honor will fall to either Michigan or Seton Hall at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and Higgins each scored 14 for Michigan, now 29-7, while Kenny Battle 
had 29 and Anderson 17 for the Illini, 31-5. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan shot 47 percent from the field, Illinois 45 percent. Michigan had 45 
rebounds, Illinois 39. 
</P>
<P>
When Michigan called time out with 1:36 to play and Illinois ahead 79-78, both 
teams had hit 17 of 34 shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hughes created the final lead change of the game, rebounding a miss by 
Mills, then converting a three-point play to put the Wolverines ahead 81-79 
with 1:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois called timeout, and when the Illini came back, Battle hit a short 
jumper in the lane, tying the score at 81 with 33 seconds left. Robinson took 
the ball upcourt for Michigan and ran the clock down to the final few seconds 
before finding Mills in the right corner. 
</P>
<P>
Mills' 3-point attempt was long, Higgins took the rebound, put it in and 
Michigan was ahead 83-81.

P.J. SHOWS DUKE THAT SETON HALL IS KING, 95-78 
</P>

<P>
How clear it seemed that the promise of this Duke team had finally come. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ferry was displaying all the storied savvy that has marked his career, 
the same that has helped Duke to the Final Four three times in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall was flustered and ineffective and looking like the newcomer it is. 
The Pirates were down 18 points before the game was 12 minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
But then slowly at first, and then more and more surely, it changed, and Duke 
(28-8) tumbled again. 
</P>
<P>
The benefactor this time was Seton Hall (31-6), a team that was picked to 
finish seventh in the Big East Conference and now can do no worse than second 
in the country after a 95-78 victory in a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
semifinal at the Kingdome Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates ended Ferry's career and Quin Snyder's Seattle homecoming two days 
early, sending Seton Hall and Coach P.J. Carlesimo into their first NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
They will play Michigan on Monday for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Who could have foretold it? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not Ferry. Despite Daryll Walker's persistent defense, Ferry scored 
21 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry backed in, muscling Walker toward the basket, then pulled back for a 
jumper. Ferry drove, or he pushed Walker's thin arms away for a turnaround. 
Before Seton Hall was used to the Kingdome, Duke led 26-8. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall did not its make first field goal until four minutes were gone, and 
didn't make its second until more than eight had passed. 
</P>
<P>
As Ferry would put it later, in a quiet steady voice, "When you're up by 18, 
you have to be fairly confident." 
</P>
<P>
As Carlesimo would put it afterward: "It looked like they were going to blow us 
out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Down by 18 after little more than 11 minutes, Seton Hall's chances seemed shot. 
</P>
<P>
But then Seton Hall's Ramon Ramos, ineffective much of the first half, pulled 
down an offensive rebound and turned it into a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
Walker made a steal off the press, and quickly popped a short jumper, and the 
lead was down to 13. 
</P>
<P>
Later, with three minutes left in the half, Gerald Greene made a three-pointer. 
So did Nick Katsikis, off the bench. The lead was five. Timeout, Duke. At 
halftime, Duke lead by only five, 38-33. 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo, who had dumped his jacket early in the game, spoke to his players. 
</P>
<P>
"He said we had to do the little things," Anthony Avent said. "But the main 
thing we had to do was calm down." 
</P>
<P>
Did they ever. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, playing with unusual combinations of players on the floor because of an 
thigh injury to Robert Brickey in the early minutes of the game, and later 
because of freshman center Christian Laettner's foul trouble, began to struggle 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall began to close the lead, and took its first at 50-49 on Michael 
Cooper's fastbreak layup. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry would turn cold, in part because of the defense of Walker and Frantz 
Volcy, in part because, he began to rush his shots as his third and final Final 
Four began to slip away. 
</P>
<P>
He missed from three-point range, and then a layup. He missed six-of-seven 
shots. And Seton Hall, hitting 22 of 31 in the second half, began to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
With the score, 67-61, Snyder tried an ill-advised three, and missed badly. 
Then Andrew Gaze, the Pirates' Australian scoring machine who had scored only 
four points in the first half, showed him how it was done, knocking down his 
first three. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder tried again and hit, cutting the lead back to 70-64. 
</P>
<P>
And Gaze put another three pointer back in his face. It was 73-64, and for 
Duke, it was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry finished with 34 points, and left the game in the final minute to watch 
his career end. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired," Ferry said. "But I would have played longer. I wish we could 
have played 20 more minutes to have a shot to win. . . . The thing I'll 
remember more than anything else is the year we had and these four years. You 
couldn't ask for more." 
</P>
<P>
But you could hope for it. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the score was 81-68, Seton Hall, Ferry's savvy was shrinking away, 
as he saw his third and final trip to the Final Four coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
In frustration, he turned to official Larry Lembo, wanting a call. 
</P>
<P>
"What about the foul?" 
</P>
<P>
What about it? 
</P>
<P>
Gaze, who finished with team-high 20 points turned to Lembo to set the record 
straight, as he saw it. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't get fouled. There was no foul." 
</P>
<P>
The winner's word stood. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's Coach Mike Krzyzewski, after three Final Fours and no championships, 
says he will not die unfulfilled if he never wins. But it was harder to bid 
this class goodby. 
</P>
<P>
They don't have another chance. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder's homecoming ended with 3:39 still left in the game when he committed 
his fifth foul with his team trailing by 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is full of successes," Snyder said. "And the more successes the better." 
</P>
<P>
What was left unstated was the most painful -- the success that eluded him, 
Ferry and John Smith. 
</P>
<P>
This team -- these seniors -- had success. Three Final Fours in four years. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't make it easier to end with this," Snyder said. "It's an empty 
feeling and it's hard to accept." For Seton Hall, it is not yet time to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got second place," Carlesimo told him team. "But we can't be satisfied 
with that."

TOROS SPLIT 2 GAMES WITH POLY POMONA; 
</P>
<P>
CCAA BASEBALL RACE REMAINS MURKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills' standing in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
baseball race remained as murky as the conference standings Saturday thanks to 
a doubleheader split with Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros, who lost at Pomona on Friday, will play again Tuesday at Pomona. 
Both are fighting for position in the CCAA, where the eight teams are separated 
by only a handful of games. 
</P>
<P>
The split left the Toros at 6-6 in the CCAA and 11-15-1 overall. Pomona is 8-6 
and 12-20. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday afternoon in Carson, the Toros staged a late rally to pull out the 
first game, 8-7, but dropped the second game, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Neidlinger scored the first game's winning run in the bottom of the ninth 
on a wild pitch by reliever David Rice. Neidlinger, who stole three bases in 
the game, had worked his way to third on a walk, steal and ground out. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona played the game under protest. The Toros had taken a 4-3 lead in the 
sixth when Adrian Rodriguez doubled in Billy Keep, then scored on a dropped fly 
ball in center field. After rounding third, Rodriguez removed his batting 
helmet, then resumed running and scored. Pomona argued that the helmet removal 
was a rules violation. After checking the scorebook, the umpires let the play 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, however, appeared to be moot as the Broncos struck for three runs 
in the seventh, helped by a run-scoring fly dropped at the wall in left field 
and a passed ball that scored another. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros got one run back in their half of the inning on Ruben Jauregui's 
double that drove in a run, but Pomona answered with a run in the eighth to 
take a 7-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills started its rally in the bottom of the eighth with some 
unexpected help. With a man on, Fred Camarena hit a ground ball that deflected 
off the infield umpire for a single. Vic Fresca then tied the game with a 
two-run double, setting up the ninth-inning comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Charlie Plumley, who relieved starter Ron Veazey in the 
seventh, got his first victory. Pomona starter Scott Burns, who left after 
walking Neidlinger to open the ninth, took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Haggard dueled Bret Lachemann, son of Angels coach Marcel Lachemann, in 
the seven-inning nightcap. Haggard had outstanding stuff but battled his 
control. Pomona got two runs in the first inning, helped by two walks and an 
error. Pomona scored another run in the fourth without touching the ball -- 
four walks, three strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Haggard finally tired in the seventh, when Pomona scored twice, and left the 
game with a six-hitter and seven strikeouts -- plus eight walks and two hit 
batters. Lachemann, who was in command after the Toros scored in the first 
inning, threw a four-hitter, two of the hits by Jauregui.

DIGEST: FLUTIE MAY BATTLE KRAMER AT CALGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erik Kramer could face a short but significant hurdle in his hopes to succeed 
in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
After being cut by the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints of the National 
Football League, the former Burroughs High and Pierce College quarterback 
started the final four games of 1988 for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
This week, while Kramer was in Calgary for meetings with coaches, it was 
revealed that the Stampeders have begun negotiations to sign 1984 Heisman 
Trophy winner Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the financially strapped team concede that their chances of 
signing the 5-foot-9 Flutie are not good. Regardless, Kramer isn't fazed by the 
possibility that Flutie could be heading north. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that pro teams are constantly looking at other quarterbacks isn't 
something that has just dawned on me," Kramer told the Calgary Herald. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Nicholls, a two-time All-City selection from Cleveland High, has signed a 
letter of intent to play volleyball at Cal State Northridge. Nicholls is a 
middle blocker.

CANYONS' FAST START LEADS TO 9-6 WIN OVER BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Joy hit a grand slam in the first inning and sophomore right-hander Leif 
Christoffersen gave up one run in three innings of relief to lead College of 
the Canyons to a 9-6 victory over Bakersfield in a Western State Conference 
game Saturday at Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Joy's shot gave Canyons a 5-2 lead after the first and the Cougars added a run 
in each of the fifth and sixth innings and two in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman left-hander Mike Teich gave up five runs on 10 hits and struck out 
four in six innings to pick up the win. Christoffersen struck out five and gave 
up three hits in three innings to earn the save. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (14-11, 7-2) had five hits and committed three errors. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Pierce 7, Santa Barbara City 6 -- The Brahmas rallied for two runs in the 
seventh and scored the winning run on Billy Morris' single to right in the 
eighth in the WSC game at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied in the eighth, Tony Dello walked and advanced to second on 
Kevin Johnson's sacrifice. Dello scored from second on Morris' single. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also doubled for the Brahmas (11-13, 4-5), who collected 14 hits and 
committed one error. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 11, Valley 10 -- Chris Majors homered and Jeff Ojeda had three hits to

doubleheader at Master's. Cole, who was two for two, pitched a 10-hit complete 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs had only four singles in the second game. Craig Johnson walked and 
advanced to second on Peter Wilson's single to begin a three-run rally in the 
sixth. Cole walked to load the bases and an RBI single by Dan Bevins and Tony 
Jaime's two-run single brought the Master's to within 5-4.

BURBANK'S LEWIS WINS 2-MILE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Lewis of Burbank High clocked 9 minutes, 26.33 seconds to win the 
invitational two-mile run at the Beverly Hills-UCLA Relays at Drake Stadium on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the Southern Section 3-A Division cross-country champion, took the lead 
for good after a slowish, 75-second first lap and covered the final 400 meters 
in 63 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ridiculous," the Bulldog senior said. "It was too slow. I had to take 
it out." 
</P>
<P>
After winning the 800 meters in 1:55.37 at the Pasadena Games last Saturday, 
Lewis ran back-to-back 4:43 miles to outlast Miraleste's Gary Stolz, second in 
9:36.78. 
</P>
<P>
Hart won the 4 x 800 relay (8:09.45) and placed second in the 4 x 1,600 relay 
(18:27.35). Oak Park won the sprint medley (1:33.50) and Birmingham's Sheri-Lee

5TH DISTRICT FACE-OFF ON TRANSIT, JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky called for a new 5- to 10-cent 
gasoline tax to subsidize public bus transportation, and his three opponents 
also said that improved transit is vital to the city's welfare, at a 5th 
District candidates forum Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the gas tax, which he has championed in the past, would also 
provide the funds needed to upgrade the bus system. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you need to get the white-collar workers out of their cars," 
Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activist Laura M. Lake, who is seen as Yaroslavsky's toughest 
foe, said she would put more buses on the street, build a light-rail system and 
use more shuttle buses. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Snyder, a professional transportation consultant, said he would be the 
"most pro-transit member of the City Council that the city has ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he opposed Metro Rail as an inefficient way to use transportation 
funds. He called for improved bus service, more ride sharing and better 
transportation planning. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McGrath, a write-in candidate, said he would mandate that all city 
employees use public transportation. McGrath also called for a half-cent sales 
tax to pay for road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showed Restraint 
</P>
<P>
The candidates fielded a series of similar questions at the well-attended 
forum, held at Temple Beth Am in West Los Angeles. However, they also showed 
more restraint than in past meetings. 
</P>
<P>
On development, Lake said Yaroslavsky has opened the 5th District to more 
mini-malls and large malls than any other district in the city. "What we need 
is planning," Lake said. "You have to give more than lip service." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, the co-author of the city's landmark slow-growth initiative, said 
he has done everything possible to protect the 5th District from excessive 
development but said that even that may not be enough. "Sometimes you have to 
tell a developer that we're going to emasculate your zoning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said growth should be addressed as a regional phenomenon and called for 
a better balance of jobs and housing, while McGrath said community plans should 
never be violated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Harmony 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of encouraging ethnic harmony in Los Angeles, Snyder said the 
city must spend the money to help immigrants assimilate. Yaroslavsky said that 
the city should celebrate its ethnic diversity and that better job training is 
needed. Lake called for better language-training programs. And McGrath said he 
would provide more recreation facilities in poor areas to discourage gang 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's forum marked the third time the candidates have appeared together. 
The challengers have accused Yaroslavsky of ducking other joint campaign 
events, but the councilman is expected to participate in at least one more, a 
debate sponsored by a cable television station on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Full Command 
</P>
<P>
As the race enters its final week, Yaroslavsky still appears to be in full 
command. The councilman has been actively campaigning, even going so far as to 
mail potholders with campaign messages to voters last week, and political 
observers say they would be surprised to see him forced into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Lake, who has been fairly quiet in recent weeks, tried to turn up the heat on 
Yaroslavsky on Wednesday in a press conference at which she accused him of a 
series of questionable deals. 
</P>
<P>
Lake claimed Yaroslavsky has allowed the demolition of more affordable housing 
than any other council member. She produced a chart showing that 27% of the 
affordable housing lost citywide between 1977 and 1987 was in the 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a demolition derby," Lake said. "Those are the cold, hard facts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parking Criticisms 
</P>
<P>
Lake also criticized Yaroslavsky for promoting permit parking as a solution to 
the district's intense parking shortage. In permit parking districts, parking 
is limited to residents who have obtained special permits. Lake said the 
permits, which cost $35 a year, are an unnecessary inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
She also noted that Yaroslavsky's district, which includes West Los Angeles, 
Century City, Westwood, the Beverly-Fairfax area and parts of the southern San 
Fernando Valley, has more permit parking than any other. The 5th District has 
18 of the 30 permit parking districts created citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Lake said she would push for more parking in commercial developments and would 
free parking meter funds for the construction of new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky brushed Lake's criticisms aside, saying they were a symbol of 
desperation.

GROUP VOWS TO RENEW FIGHT TO BLOCK CULVER CITY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, the Mar Vista del Rey Homeowners &amp; Neighbors Assn. 
successfully fought developers' plans to build housing on the railroad right of 
way on the Culver Boulevard median just west of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Now a new developer is proposing similar plans, and members of the association 
are gearing up for another fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to any development on Culver Boulevard," said Salvatore 
Grammatico, president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous," said Edie Szabo, a property owner who was active in the last 
fight. "We are fighting the same battle again." 
</P>
<P>
Heltzer Enterprises in Santa Monica is in escrow to purchase nearly 10 acres of 
railroad right of way along Culver Boulevard between Sawtelle Boulevard and 
McConnell Avenue from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Ann Connelly, a consultant to the developer, said the purchase is 
contingent on Heltzer being able to build its project. Connelly said the firm 
has told Santa Fe it will decide within 60 days whether it will go forward with 
the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sale Price Not Revealed 
</P>
<P>
Connelly would not reveal the sale price, but three years ago developers agreed 
to pay $4.5 million for the one-mile-long, 60-foot-wide median. That deal fell 
through when the developers could not get city approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly also would not reveal the number of units being proposed, saying the 
firm wants to be flexible so that it can address community and political 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to find out what the community wants and what Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter wants," Connelly said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the project would likely be a mix of apartments and townhouses, with 
open space for parks and a jogging track. Unlike the previous project, which 
was to be paid for with state funds and would have been required to include 
low-income housing, Connelly said the new project would be privately financed, 
and the units rented and sold at market rates. 
</P>
<P>
However, the project could end up with some low- or moderate-income housing 
units if Galanter decides to make city approval contingent on the inclusion of 
such units. 
</P>
<P>
"Councilwoman Galanter tries to get a certain percentage of all projects for 
low- or moderate-income housing," Connelly said. "Whatever that percentage is 
would determine the density of the project, and how many townhouses we have 
versus how many apartment units." 
</P>
<P>
Connelly said plans are still preliminary, and that comparisons to the 
previously proposed project are "comparing apples to oranges." 
</P>
<P>
"Our desire is to do something that provides as much open space as possible to 
give the community a little of what they want," Connelly said. "We want to 
clean up the area. Right now, it's an eyesore with trash and abandoned 
vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter spokesman Rick Ruiz said the councilwoman is waiting for more 
information on the project before taking a position. 
</P>
<P>
"However, we do have some concern about the use of the site for that type of 
project," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents had hoped Galanter would immediately oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of disappointment being expressed in the community," Szabo 
said. "She (Galanter) needs to see that the community is against it, and 
support her community." 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting the same kind of reaction we got from (former Councilwoman) Pat 
Russell on the previous project, which is non-communicative," Grammatico said. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, who was defeated by Galanter in 1987, remained neutral on the previous 
project until right before it went to the Planning Commission for approval. She 
then opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Watt/Parker Inc. and Oliver A. Trigg Jr. had proposed building 180 
housing units over two phases on the median, which is between an access road 
commonly referred to as "Little Culver Boulevard" on the north, and Culver 
Boulevard on the south. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1985, the City Planning Commission rejected plans for the first 
phase, 98 townhouses on the median between Inglewood Boulevard and McConnell 
Avenue. In July, 1986, a City Council committee overturned the Planning 
Commission's approval of the second phase, an 82-unit apartment complex between 
Inglewood and Sawtelle boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Residents opposed the development because housing on that site is contrary to 
the community plan for the area, which designates the Culver Boulevard median 
as open space. 
</P>
<P>
Culver Boulevard is also designated as a major highway in city plans. The city 
transportation department says major highways must be 80 to 84 feet wide. 
Culver Boulevard along the stretch in question is 49 feet wide. Nothing has 
been done about widening the road because the median is privately owned, and 
city officials say they don't have the money to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who opposed the former development plans said the project would have 
brought more traffic, and complained that additional low-income housing would 
have caused the neighborhood to deteriorate. They said their part of town 
already has its share of low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista Gardens, a low-income housing project marred by gang and drug 
problems, is bounded on the west by Inglewood Boulevard and on the north by 
Braddock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed development would have been financed by state funds earmarked to 
house people displaced by the Century Freeway. According to state law, up to 
49% of the units would have been designated for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trailers for Homeless 
</P>
<P>
Gang and drug problems continue to plague the area, and traffic problems are 
expected to get worse, particularly after the proposed massive Playa Vista 
commercial/residential project south of Marina del Rey is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of Playa Vista, Culver Boulevard, which runs through the project, will 
be used as a major east-west artery," Grammatico said. 
</P>
<P>
The community is also fighting Galanter on a proposal to place four trailers to 
house the homeless on city-owned property on Centinela Avenue near Culver 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Grammatico said the majority of the community would like to see Culver 
Boulevard widened and landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, the city of Los Angeles would have to buy the property, something 
Ruiz says the city cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
But residents are not satisfied with that response. 
</P>
<P>
"That's totally absurd," Grammatico said. "If they don't have the money, maybe 
they should cut some of the fat in city government."

WEISFUSS' BIG HIT SUCCEEDS WHERE ATTEMPTS AT LITTLE ONES FAIL

Ted Weisfuss was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
With runners on first and second and nobody out in the bottom of the ninth 
inning Saturday, his Cal State Northridge team trailed Cal State Los Angeles by 
a run. Weisfuss fouled off a sacrifice bunt attempt that sailed back to the 
screen behind home plate at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
On the next pitch, Weisfuss popped another bunt attempt directly behind home 
plate where only a slow-footed umpire who couldn't get out of the catcher's way 
saved an out. 
</P>
<P>
Thus reprieved, Weisfuss ran the count to 3-2 before drilling an Abdom Pinon 
fastball into the left-center-field gap for a double that drove in the winning 
run in Northridge's dramatic 11-10 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge improved to 15-9-1 overall, 6-6-1 in conference play. Cal State L. 
A. dropped to 14-19, 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of my game is bunting but I didn't do it," said Weisfuss, a senior 
utility player who has delivered in the clutch several times this season. "I 
just had a bad day at the plate. After I brutalized those first two pitches, I 
was just trying to put the ball in play." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and Cal State L. A. had trouble playing little ball all day but more 
than made up for that with the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams hit four home runs and took advantage of the sunny, breezy 
conditions with a performance that evoked memories of just how awesome a 
slugfest can become in the launching pad that is Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard about this," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said after his first 
encounter with the phenomenon. "I don't like it very much. I'm glad I'm not a 
pitcher here." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge pitcher Robert Wheatcroft, however, was fairly happy after pitching 
7 1/3 innings in relief of starter Vale Lopez to earn the win and improve to 
7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Wheatcroft, a senior, knows all too well about the havoc wreaked by the long 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
By surrendering three homers Saturday, including two in the eighth inning -- to 
Ed Pimental and Rex De la Nuez -- that allowed Cal State L. A. to increase its 
lead to 10-7, Wheatcroft has allowed 14 homers this season and 10 in just 32 
1/3 innings of CCAA play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fly-ball pitcher," Wheatcroft joked. "This park can't hold me." 
</P>
<P>
Neither could it contain Northridge designated-hitter Chae-Ho Chong, who hit 
his fourth home run of the season, freshman Greg Shockey and senior Anton 
Siegl, who hit back-to-back homers in the fourth inning, or sophomore Randy 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge trailed, 10-9, when Pinon surrendered a single to Siegl, then walked 
pinch-hitter Kevin Ogle to open the bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
That set the stage for Weisfuss, who drove in Siegl and pinch-runner Fili 
Martinez with his line drive into the gap.

SOVIETS GET GRIM LOOK AT HOLOCAUST

<P>
"We never knew," the old man said as he looked at the gruesome pictures of the 
bodies of Jews killed by Nazi troops. "We had heard some things, a little bit 
then and more later, but we have never known the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Many have said that of the Holocaust, but this man, Yakov Kelman, now in his 
70s, was Jewish himself -- and from an area in the Ukraine where the Nazis' 
special mobile killing squads had operated after Germany's invasion of the 
Soviet Union in June, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Village Was Gone 
</P>
<P>
Kelman recalled how he had managed to escape from his village before it was 
occupied by the advancing German troops. When he returned after the war, none 
of his family was left -- two sisters and a brother were located later -- but 
then little was left of the village. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything had been burned, razed to the ground, and five years later even the 
ruins were overgrown," Kelman said, preferring to speak in Yiddish rather than 
Russian. "We were never certain what had happened there. . . . For the first 
time, I see what was this Holocaust that people speak of." 
</P>
<P>
With his grandson translating the captions for him, Kelman was touring the 
photo exhibit on the Holocaust at the new Jewish cultural center, which opened 
here last month as part of the current resurgence of Jewish community life. The 
exhibit, "The Courage to Remember," is composed of 40 panels of photographs, 
quotations, maps and other historical material brought to Moscow by the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand Jews have visited the exhibit -- an unprecedented event for 
Moscow -- since it opened Feb. 12. And many were clearly shocked by the 
magnitude of the story that it tells, because the Holocaust has remained a 
"blank spot of history," an area so ideologically sensitive that Soviet 
authorities had, until now, banned any version except their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Our knowledge of the Holocaust is very uncertain," said Veniamin Belitsky, a 
mathematics teacher who conducts after-school classes on Jewish culture and 
history. "We know, of course, what the Holocaust is, but as historical fact it 
is rather abstract. We know, too, what the Great Patriotic War, as we call 
World War II, was for our country, but we do not fully understand how one 
related to the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us have a personal knowledge of the Holocaust as well -- events we 
lived through, or our parents or aunts and uncles lived through and told us 
about -- but again, we have difficulty relating these little pieces to the 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
"This for any person would be a matter of shame, but for a Jew that shame 
should be very great." 
</P>
<P>
In the current Soviet history of World War II, the Nazis' persecution and 
extermination of an estimated 6 million European Jews from 1933 to 1945 is 
treated not as Hitler's "final solution of the Jewish question" but simply as 
further evidence of the evil nature of fascism and the need for the 
international struggle that finally defeated it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brief Mentions 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 edition of the authoritative Great Soviet Encyclopedia summarizes the 
Holocaust in a single paragraph in a lengthy article on Jews and gives it only 
two lines in an even longer article on anti-Semitism. It is barely mentioned in 
the encyclopedia's detailed history of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
When the Wiesenthal center translated the panels into Russian for publication 
in a booklet, no single word could be found for holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to use the phrase Jewish Catastrophe," Gerald Margolis, the center 
director, said. "The reason is that Soviet history has never dealt with the 
extermination of Jews as Jews, the way they were marked for elimination and the 
way that their annihilation was carried out. What happened to Jews in the 
Soviet Union is submerged in what happened to the country as a whole. Yet, 
quite clearly, quite objectively, what happened to Jews was different." 
</P>
<P>
Of an estimated 4.8 million Jews living on Soviet-held territory when Germany 
invaded in 1941, as many as half were killed, according to Alec Nove and J. A. 
Newth, British specialists on the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Using Soviet census records, Nove and Newth have calculated that in some 
regions less than a fifth of the Jewish population survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
"The Holocaust was no secret from us -- we knew what had happened," Mikhail 
Livshitz, another visitor, said as he toured the exhibit. "The survivors told 
us, and this became part of our identity as Jews that has been passed from 
father to son, from mother to daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"But these were memories, not history. If you looked for the history of the 
Holocaust, you could not find it in the Soviet Union. Some writers, of course, 
have dealt bravely and sympathetically with what happened to Jews, but real 
knowledge and understanding of the Holocaust are still rare." 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Kuznetzov, who later defected and died in the West, wrote a documentary 
novel that was published in 1966 -- with many changes by government censors -- 
about the massacre of Jews at Babi Yar, a ravine outside the Ukrainian capital 
of Kiev where 34,000 people, mostly Jews, were killed in two days in September, 
1941. 
</P>
<P>
The poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko had already demanded, in an angry 1961 poem, why 
up to then no monument had been built at Babi Yar, where altogether at least 
100,000 people -- two-thirds of them Jews -- were killed over two years. 
</P>
<P>
Yevtushenko's poem, still one of his best-known, was sharply attacked by 
Communist Party officials, including Nikita S. Khrushchev, then the party's 
first secretary. Composer Dmitri Shostakovich later used the text for a choral 
symphony. But only in 1976 was a monument put up at Babi Yar, and its plaque 
said tersely that "Soviet citizens" had been executed there by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story Appears in Books 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Rybakov, the author of the current best-selling novel "Children of the 
Arbat," wrote in detail in a 1978 novel, "Heavy Sand," about the fate of Jews 
under the Nazi occupation of the Ukraine. Published in a period of increasing 
anti-Semitism and rejected as "too provocative" by Novy Mir, the country's 
premier literary journal, "Heavy Sand" was a sensation -- but a brief one, as 
the book quickly sold out and was reprinted only eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the literary journal Znamya published a story, described as the 
first of its kind in a Soviet publication, on an underground resistance group 
in the Jewish ghetto of the Byelorussian capital of Minsk during the Nazi 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
In the official Soviet assessment, however, the suffering of the Jews under the 
Nazis was no different than that of others, and theirs was a shared fate. 
</P>
<P>
"Jews were marked for annihilation -- that is clear and incontrovertible," 
Margolis said. "And when someone, particularly a country from where many of the 
victims came, where much of the killing went on, cannot or will not face up to 
this, it raises many questions of why." 
</P>
<P>
The answer, some Soviet historians now acknowledge, lies first in the past 
needs of the Soviet Communist Party to identify the great nationalist struggle 
to defeat the Nazis with the party's own need to defend socialism and its 
leadership of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Elie Wiesel, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for his efforts to ensure 
that the Holocaust is remembered, called on the Soviet leadership while 
speaking at the opening of the new Jewish cultural center to "stop this process 
of de-Judaizing the Holocaust." He said it was "of the utmost importance to us 
as Jews" for the nature of the Holocaust to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
While looking at the monument at Babi Yar, Wiesel said, "I was angry and 
ashamed. Eighty thousand Jews were killed at Babi Yar, and the word Jew does 
not even appear on this monument." 
</P>
<P>
A second element in the Soviet attitude toward the Holocaust has been the 
recurrent waves of anti-Semitism in Soviet society over the 
</P>
<P>
past 40 years, some Soviet historians say frankly in recently published 
assessments. 
</P>
<P>
In officially approved anti-Zionist propaganda, for example, little distinction 
was made between Zionism, which Soviet authorities continue to oppose as 
"reactionary" and "chauvinistic," and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviet propaganda has asserted, as recently as four or five years ago, 
that the Holocaust not only has been exaggerated, but also that Zionist forces 
decided to use the Nazi campaign to help them establish a Jewish state. In such 
Soviet propaganda, Jewish financiers are said to have put Hitler in power in 
Germany, with the intention of using him to establish their own global 
political and economic control. 
</P>
<P>
With the increased official Soviet tolerance for Soviet Jews to practice and 
develop their culture, many in the Jewish community here believe that a 
reevaluation of the Holocaust will come. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's Main Archival Administration signed an agreement last July 
with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council to permit historians, archivists and 
curators to study Soviet archives on the Nazi genocide here. Many will be 
copied for inclusion in the U.S. Holocaust Museum, which is scheduled to open 
in Washington in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"When this information comes out -- how it happened -- then we will have to 
confront that it really did happen and search for the answer to why," said a 
Soviet historian who helped promote the agreement, asking not to be quoted by 
name. "At that point, I think, we will acknowledge the annihilation of Jews -- 
the Holocaust -- as a particular crime of the Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
Last year for the first time, Soviet authorities permitted official observance, 
both here and in Kiev, of the anniversary of the massacre at Babi Yar. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish cultural groups, which are proliferating after years of suppression, 
also are expected to play a major role in educating Soviet Jews on the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"For Jews, knowledge and understanding of the Holocaust should be galvanizing," 
the Wiesenthal center's Margolis said. "That is why it is so distressing that 
even adults in the Jewish community have no sense of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, this exhibit will be more than a history lesson, we hope. We expect 
that it will strengthen their identity as Jews, their solidarity as a 
community, their commitment."

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: AGENT HAS NO EXCUSE FOR HIS SILENCE ON PLANNED FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My daughter and son-in-law recently bought their first home. To put 
it mildly, I think they were swindled. An estate was selling the home, so an 
attorney represented the seller. But the real estate agent failed to disclose 
that the state had bought up all the houses across the street where a new 
expressway will be built in two years. This will cause massive construction 
problems and the noisy traffic will hurt the value of the house. 
</P>
<P>
My daughter and son-in-law recently moved to the city and were not familiar 
with local developments. Don't you think the real estate agent should have 
known about this new expressway and told them? If so, what can they do to get 
out of this bad deal? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A real estate agent owes a fiduciary duty, like a trustee, to both the 
seller and the buyer. Such a massive project as a new expressway should be 
common knowledge to local realty agents. Since your daughter and son-in-law 
were moving to the area from out of town and did not know about it, they were 
entitled to rely on the realty agent to inform them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the seller was an estate, there still should have been full disclosure 
to the buyers about the noisy expressway, which will substantially affect the 
home's market value and desirability. Since the defect was well-known in the 
community, there was no excuse for the seller, as well as the realty agent, not 
telling the buyers about the new noisy expressway. 
</P>
<P>
You should suggest they consult a local real estate attorney to seek either 
rescission of the sale or monetary damages for the diminished property value. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Carry Financing for Seller Too Long 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 74, and plan to sell my home so I can move to a nice retirement home 
while I am still in good health. With today's rising interest rates, I think I 
should carry back the first mortgage on my home so I can earn high interest. 
</P>
<P>
Realty agents say my home should sell for about $195,000. I figure with a 
$20,000 down payment, I can carry back the $175,000 balance at perhaps 12% 
interest on a 30-year mortgage. That would be $21,000 annual interest, which is 
higher than I can earn elsewhere. What do you think of this idea? 
</P>
<P>
A: Congratulations for realizing the benefits of selling your home on an 
installment sale and earning higher interest than you can receive elsewhere. 
However, I am not too confident you will live to 104 and collect the final 
payment on a 30-year mortgage. But if you don't, every time your heirs receive 
a payment, they will thank you. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to go ahead with your idea, but have the loan callable by you 
or your heirs every five years. Then you will be in the driver's seat to decide 
if you want the mortgage paid off or if you want to extend it for another five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
I have several mortgage loans from elderly sellers that are callable every five 
years. So far, they have all elected to renew their high interest rate loans 
for additional five-year periods. But, at least they have the opportunity to 
get their principal if they should need the money. 
</P>
<P>
An Unrecorded Deed May Prove to Be Valid 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am trying to help my aunt straighten out her financial affairs. In going 
through her safe deposit box, I found the deed to her home, which appears to be 
unrecorded. It was executed in 1970 to her and her late husband. I have a 
friend who works at a title insurance company and he checked the ownership. He 
reports the house's ownership is still in the previous owner's name, but I know 
he is dead. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: That unrecorded deed may be perfectly valid if it was properly executed and 
acknowledged before a notary public. If not, your aunt may have to file a 
quiet-title lawsuit to perfect her title to the home. I suggest presenting the 
deed to a local title insurance company and buying a title insurance policy if 
the company will insure it. If not, the company can advise you on how to 
proceed at the least expense to clear up your aunt's title to the property. 
</P>
<P>
High Risks of Paying Cash for Your Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I recently sold our home for cash. It is a very nice feeling to 
have almost $200,000 cash in the bank. However, we plan to move to Sarasota, 
Fla., where we want to buy a nice retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to that "over 55 rule" $125,000 tax exemption, we don't have to worry 
about paying any tax on our sale profit. Our problem is, I think we should pay 
cash for the small house we buy, but my wife says we should save our money and 
live off the interest. With the high interest rates we can earn on Treasury 
notes and money market funds, I admit that is tempting. But, don't you think we 
should own our retirement home free and clear? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Please listen to your smart wife. I agree it would be nice to own your 
retirement home free and clear, but it is more important to have cash readily 
available for emergencies and other investments. 
</P>
<P>
I wish I could share all the pathetic letters I receive from homeowner retirees 
who own their home free and clear, but now can borrow only at loan-shark rates 
(because they have insufficient income) to meet emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you have significant income and other reserves, conserve your cash when 
buying that retirement home. You should expect to make a 20% to 25% cash down 
payment and obtain a mortgage for the 75% to 80% balance. I presume you will 
have adequate income to make the monthly mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
Another benefit of obtaining a big mortgage is that Uncle Sam helps subsidize 
your interest expense. For example, if you are like most taxpayers in the 28% 
income tax bracket, for every $100 of interest you pay to the mortgage lender, 
Uncle Sam subsidizes $28, so your net cost is only $72. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you pay all cash for your home, you receive no housing subsidy. 
Since you worked hard to earn your money, you deserve to benefit from it now. 
Get the biggest mortgage you can when you buy your retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
Donating Real Estate Can Guarantee Income 
</P>
<P>
Q: Many years ago, my father was greatly helped by the Salvation Army, which 
rehabilitated him when he was an alcoholic. I was in Germany in the U.S. Army 
and didn't know about his problems. He recovered and made a success of himself. 
He is now 72 and has more money than he can ever spend. His will amply provides 
for my sister and me. But he wants to donate a substantial sum to the Salvation 
Army for the help they gave him. 
</P>
<P>
His house is worth about $500,000, and the Salvation Army will accept it as a 
donation. It will give my father a lifetime income in return. He gets a 
charitable donation on his income-tax return if he gives the house to the 
Salvation Army. Do you think this makes sense? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The Salvation Army gladly accepts real estate donations and will 
provide lifetime income to the donor, based on the donor's age and the value of 
the donated property. I can think of no better charity to receive your father's 
gift than the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Seller Financing Is Making a Comeback 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I plan to sell our home in the next few months. We plan to 
move to our vacation home, where we will live all year. I recall that a few 
years ago it was fashionable for home sellers to carry back all or part of the 
sales price in a first or second mortgage. We could use the extra retirement 
income, since we own our home clear with no mortgage. What interest rate do you 
think we could get if we carry the mortgage for our buyer? 
</P>
<P>
A: As mortgage interest rates rise, seller financing is making a comeback. With 
today's fixed-interest rate mortgages above 11% and adjustable rates almost 
that high after the initial "teaser rate" for six months, seller financing can 
be very attractive to home buyers. Another benefit is your easy financing means 
you can get top dollar for your home. 
</P>
<P>
For example, I make mortgage payments on several homes at 12% to 13% interest 
rates to retirees from whom I purchased rental houses. These folks, who now 
live in retirement havens such as Florida, Arizona, California, Minnesota, and 
New York, depend on my income and, because I always make the payments on time, 
they have even asked me to extend the loans several times. 
</P>
<P>
Still another advantage is that you can qualify for installment sale taxation 
of any profit which is not eligible for the "over 55 rule" $125,000 home sale 
tax break. 
</P>
<P>
However, the interest income is taxable as ordinary income. In today's market 
you should be able to get at least 11% to 12% interest on seller financing. 
Your realty agent can give you further information. 
</P>
<P>
Family Rental Below Market Not Advised 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own a home where I used to live. The tenant recently vacated and I want my 
elderly father to live there. However, he cannot pay the $1,100 per month the 
previous tenant was paying. My tax adviser says if I don't collect market rent 
for the house I cannot continue to take tax deductions for this house. Is this 
true? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can always deduct mortgage interest and property tax payments. However, 
if you charge below-market rent and the IRS audits your tax return, you could 
be denied any losses which exceed the amount of rent collected. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid Condo Rentals If You Want Net Profit 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have up to $10,000 to invest. I know that isn't much, but I can buy a nice 
condo for just $7,500 down. I already own my home and would rent the condo. Do 
you think this would be a good investment? 
</P>
<P>
A: Of course, I cannot advise on specific investments. However, I have yet to 
hear from a person who has earned a substantial net profit from a condo rental 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
The big problems are that rent usually does not pay all expenses such as 
mortgage payment, property tax and monthly assessment fee, and condos usually 
do not appreciate in value as fast as single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
I realize the big condo attraction is low maintenance cost, but the 
disadvantage is condos usually don't appreciate much in market value.

USC WILL HONOR ARCHITECT MASTON; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL TO GIVE AWARD TO ALUMNUS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS INNOVATIVE, MODERN-STYLE 
DESIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Carl Maston was in his senior year at USC in 1936, he still didn't know 
whether he wanted to pursue a career as a pianist or an architect. 
</P>
<P>
Although he worked hard as an architectural student during the school year, 
he'd spend his summers practicing the piano for eight hours a day and would cap 
it with a public concert before heading back to school in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
His piano instructor thought Maston had a bright future as a soloist. But 
Maston chose architecture, and over the next half-century would go on to design 
everything from honored homes to ice rinks. 
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Angeleno, who still practices architecture on a part-time 
basis, will receive the USC School of Architecture's 1989 Distinguished Alumni 
Award at the Architectural Guild dinner April 12. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inauspicious Beginning 
</P>
<P>
In announcing that Maston had won the award, Robert S. Harris, dean of the 
school, said Maston is being singled out "for excellence in design and 
innovative leadership in public service." 
</P>
<P>
Maston's career started on an inauspicious note: He got his architect's license 
in December, 1941, and enlisted just a few days after Pearl Harbor was bombed. 
</P>
<P>
He served as a Marine Corps transportation officer on Oahu, and later, Midway, 
but most of the fighting was over by the time he got to either island. "We 
never saw action," Maston said. "We played tennis a lot and watched gooney 
birds." 
</P>
<P>
He also daydreamed about the home he'd build in Los Angeles after the war was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
After returning home, Maston found a site on Marmont Lane in West Hollywood and 
built what would become known as the Maston House or Marmont House, a 
late-Craftsman style home that has won several design awards. 
</P>
<P>
Maston, however, is best known for his work in Modern architecture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Innovative Ice Rink 
</P>
<P>
Modernism is a functional, no-frills, technology-based style born in the 
pre-World War I days. Modern buildings are characterized by simple surfaces 
bereft of ornamentation -- buildings such as Century Plaza Towers in Century 
City and the Chemosphere House in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
One of Maston's most innovative structures was an ice rink at the corner of 
Reseda and Ventura boulevards in the San Fernando Valley community of Tarzana. 
It was built about 20 years ago, but torn down in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The rink resembled a tortoise shell. Its 36 precast concrete pieces reinforced 
each other, so the roof -- a mere 3 1/2 inches thick -- required no supporting 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
The ice rink wasn't just one of Maston's most innovative buildings: It was also 
one of his personal favorites. "I couldn't go look at it when they were tearing 
it down," said Maston, who usually worked alone. "It was like losing a baby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Headquarters Hailed 
</P>
<P>
Most of the more than 100 other buildings Maston designed -- from homes and 
shopping centers to university buildings and naval housing -- have fared better 
than the old ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters he designed in the 1960s for himself at 2811 Cahuenga Blvd. in 
Hollywood is hailed as "an ideal Modern design" by "Architecture in Los 
Angeles: A Compleat Guide." 
</P>
<P>
His other creations include the Chiat House on Camino Verde, which 
"Architecture in Los Angeles" calls "one of the best pieces of architecture in 
South Pasadena," and more than 40 other homes, ranging from California's wine 
country to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Maston also designed the School of Environmental Design at Cal Poly Pomona and 
the Creative Arts Building at California State University, San Bernardino. He 
also designed apartment buildings noted for their courtyard views, as well as 
shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner 
</P>
<P>
He has also held numerous volunteer posts, including a five-year stint as a Los 
Angeles city planning commissioner. He was president of the Southern California 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1968, and has taught several 
courses at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Maston, who is widowed and has one daughter, still takes on some architectural 
jobs, although he spends much of his free time sailing and, in the fall, 
watching Trojan football games on television. 
</P>
<P>
Several other awards will be presented at the April 12 ceremonies, including 
the guild traveling fellowships. The two fellowships will allow the winners, 
USC graduate students Steven Whitney and Paul Blazek, to study architecture 
abroad.

CITY LINES: A PRIZE SETTING

With its $100,000 tax-free grant and accompanying sculpture and worldwide 
recognition, the Pritzker Architecture Prize is the most coveted honor in the 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
Adding a touch of class to the award in recent years has been its annual 
bestowing in an appropriate landmark setting. When Austrian Hans Hollein won in 
1985, the ceremony was held at the stately Huntington Library and Art Gallery 
in San Marino. In 1987 when Japanese Kenzo Tange won, it was in the stylish 
Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the concept has been stretched a bit, and those wanting to attend 
the black-tie affair will have to journey to Nara, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will be held at the Todai-ji Buddhist Temple, the world's largest 
wooden building, dating from 1199, though originally built in 750. It is an 
officially designated Japanese National Treasure. SAM HALL KAPLAN

GARDEN NEWS: TROPICALS GROW WITH LITTLE CARE; 
</P>
<P>
BIRD OF PARADISE, ELEPHANT EARS, GINGER FLOURISHED IN '20S, '30S CALIFORNIA 
GARDENS.

<P>
For years I have been waiting for a revival of tropical plantings. In the 
1920s, 1930s and 1950s, tropical plants were in great vogue in Southern 
California. People planted gingers and philodendrons, palms and hibiscus, tree 
ferns and elephant ears, not to mention giant bird of paradise and bananas. 
Many of these are still with us, gracing older homes, but very few are being 
planted today. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a new book by Gordon Courtright will do the trick. Simply called 
"Tropicals" (Timber Press: $35.95), it is full of photos and brief descriptions 
of plants that have a tropical feel, if not tropical origins. 
</P>
<P>
Courtright's other books ("Trees and Shrubs for Temperate Climates" is one) are 
most useful for jogging the memory when one is trying to think of a good plant 
for a certain spot, but this one might inspire greater flights of fancy for no 
landscape is more fanciful than a tropical one. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these plants are also quite practical and despite their rain forest 
look, get by on very little water or care. Just look at how many have survived 
in gardens that have been all but abandoned. ROBERT SMAUS

<P>
Thanks to Tauni Brustin, gardeners can now collect more than rare cactus and 
orchids. An avid gardener, she began picking up antique garden objects on her 
buying trips, first for herself and then for her store, Main St. U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
She's collected enough, in fact, to hold a monthlong garden furniture and 
pottery sale in April. Some of the items in the sale are most useful: 
</P>
<P>
Old wood and iron garden gates that can give a garden the soft air of antiquity 
not otherwise found in California; chairs and benches to dignify an otherwise 
bland corner of a terrace; plants stands and pots -- including a notable 
collection of California pottery intended for outdoor use. 
</P>
<P>
And there are the not-so-useful items that will intrigue gardeners nonetheless, 
such as fascinating patented sprinklers, cans of primitive insecticides and 
other old garden gadgets that survived the decades in someone's tool shed. The 
store, at 1325 West Washington Blvd. in Venice, is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
Monday through Saturday. Telephone: (213) 392-6676. ROBERT SMAUS

GARDEN NEWS: PERENNIAL POPPIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California gardeners, seeing gorgeous photographs in books, have been 
trying to grow oriental poppies for years. These brightly colored, 
huge-flowered poppies are perennials and are reasonably easy in cold climates, 
but not so here. They will grow and they may even flower after a few years in 
the ground, but the flowers are often on such short stems that they bloom 
inside the foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there was hope that a new kind of Oriental poppy might grow well in 
Southern California, and this year we can report that there are indeed oriental 
poppies we can grow -- a special strain developed right here in California. 
This strain came from crosses between a California perennial poppy and an 
Oriental, and it resulted in poppies called Minicaps. 
</P>
<P>
They bloomed in my own garden most of last summer and are blooming again right 
now, with flowers six to seven inches across. Do not expect a mass of flowers 
at any one time but there are nearly always a few in flower. Individual flowers 
only stay open two or three days, but they are quite a spectacle during that 
short time. The fuzzy, slightly gray foliage makes a mound about two feet by 
two feet and flowers are on stems about three to four feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some perennials, these should not be cut to the ground for winter, but 
just left alone. You may dig the plants up and move them in winter as I did, so 
they could be in a sunnier spot. They like lots of sun. 
</P>
<P>
Minicaps will be available at the Huntington Botanic Garden Plant Sale on May 
21. Tickets may be obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed legal envelope 
to Huntington Plant Sale, 1151 Oxford St., San Marino, Calif. 91108. You can 
also order them directly from the grower who offers a color catalogue for a 
25-cent stamp. Write to Mohn's, P.O. Box 2301, Atascadero, Calif. 93423. ROBERT

GOOD TIME TO PLANT JAPANESE MAPLE TREE

<TEXT>
<P>
Now is a good time to plant a Japanese maple tree -- it fits into any garden. 
It grows as a small tree or shrub that offers spring growth in a red color, 
soft green summer leaves and fall foliage of scarlet, orange or yellow. As a 
bonus, it provides a graceful silhouette of delicate green or red branches in 
the winter.

COUPLE DECIDES THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME;

<P>
SMALL-TOWN FEELING, DIVERSE POPULATION INSPIRE THE REMODELING OF A VERY MODEST 
HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 777-square-foot house in the hills of Altadena that was ideal for bachelor 
Ken Davis in 1977 was bursting at the seams for him as a family man in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after they were married in 1983, Ken and Jette Davis considered buying 
a larger house before deciding to remodel their 40-year-old two-bedroom 
ranch-style house in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
They looked at houses from Glendora to Valencia, but kept coming back to 
Altadena, an unincorporated area north of Pasadena with a diverse mix of 
middle-class blacks and whites, yuppies and older couples. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to remodel when we found that none of the houses we looked at had 
as good a location as the house for which I paid $35,000 in 1977," said Davis, 
a news executive at television station KTLA, Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small-Town Atmosphere 
</P>
<P>
"After a pressure-packed day in the news business in the heart of Hollywood, 
it's great to come home to Altadena. It's like a small town in the mountains. 
Furthermore, I want our children to grow up in a community that has diversity." 
</P>
<P>
Danish-born Jette Davis was pregnant with their youngest son, Philip, during 
the six-month remodeling process. Their other son, Christopher, is 4. Philip is 
now almost 3 months old. 
</P>
<P>
Working with an architect friend from Palo Alto, Chris Tripoli, Davis came up 
with a plan that would create a new master bath and closet, extend the living 
room and add a third bedroom. Tripoli drew the basic drawings and Lon Cross, an 
engineer at Lockheed in Burbank, drew the working blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, we wanted to have the new child's bedroom in the front and an 
extension, with a bay window, to the living room," Davis said. "We changed our 
plans, moving the bedroom to the rear of the house when we discovered that our 
neighborhood has a 40-foot front-yard setback. We could go out only 12 feet 
from the front facade of the house." 
</P>
<P>
The setback requirement forced the Davises to keep the bay window projection of 
the living room and the new master bathroom on the same plane: "We originally 
wanted the bedroom to project farther out," he said. The bay window 
incorporates a window seat with storage underneath.

Davis cites the setback as an example of pitfalls that face homeowners planning 
a remodeling project: 
</P>
<P>
"If something in the design looks wrong or out of character with the rest of 
the neighborhood, let it be a warning to you," he said. "What finally tipped me 
off was a walk through my neighborhood. I saw the houses set back uniformly 
from the street." 
</P>
<P>
Once the Davises were aware of the setback requirements, the project was back 
on track. Thanks to a previous remodeling, which added 230 square feet to the 
house, the kitchen was adequate for their needs and didn't need changing. The 
master bath, relocated to the front of the house, has French doors leading to 
the bedroom. There is a cathedral ceiling in the master bath, contributing to 
the light and airy feeling both Ken and Jette wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to this feeling are the light, neutral colors throughout the 
remodeled areas of the home. They make the relatively small structure look 
larger, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted sisal floor-covering, something Jette was familiar with from Europe, 
but it would have been too rough on the children's feet," Davis said. "We 
finally went with vinyl flooring in the bath and carpeting in the other areas." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Paul of J.P. Construction, Burbank, was not the lowest bidder of the four 
contractors the Davises interviewed, but he was chosen because of 
recommendations from friends whose houses Paul had remodeled, Ken Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Choosing a contractor who is at once competent, reliable, honest and 
compatible is critical, because the contractor becomes part of your family 
during construction process," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We depended on Jeff to fix things that some of the subcontractors might have 
missed and give us advice," he said. Perhaps the best advice Paul gave them was 
to allow at least 20% over the estimate for extras and cost overruns, Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out that Jeff was right," he said. "We decided to rebuild a wall 
that had been damaged by too many earthquakes and we extended the back bedroom 
wall a foot. We exceeded the original estimate by about 25%." 
</P>
<P>
The house is now worth nearly 10 times what Davis paid for it a dozen years 
ago. The latest expansion -- there was a small one in the early 1980s -- has 
added 650 square feet to the house. The look is that of a contemporary New 
England-style house, similar to many the Davises saw on their house-hunting 
trips.

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOME IMPROVEMENT;

SPECIAL TOOL WILL SHUT OFF MAIN WATER LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I was told to place a tag on the main water valve to the house so 
everyone will know where it is in case of emergency. But the only valve I can 
find is outside the house. It is partially underground and it would be a tough 
job to turn it off. In fact, it appears it cannot even be shut off without a 
special wrench. What do I do now? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You are correct. Some outside valves require the use of a special tool 
to keep them from being turned by a vandal. There must be a shut-off valve 
inside your house. It usually is located at the point where there is a water 
meter or where the main pipe enters the house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mortar Mix Better for Brick Wall Joints 
</P>
<P>
Q: I plan to put up a brick wall. I know it is a bit more expensive to use the 
kind of sand mix that comes already prepared and needs only the addition of 
water, but I have used it in the past and found it very easy to handle. Will 
the regular sand mix be all right between the joints of the bricks? 
</P>
<P>
A: You should use a mortar mix rather than a sand mix. It is virtually the same 
but has some hydrated lime in it to make it more suitable for joints in 
brickwork. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use Pilot Holes for Drilling Fiberglass 
</P>
<P>
Q: I intend to put up a fiberglass roof on our back patio. I know fiberglass 
panels are attached to the wood framing in one of several ways. What I do not 
know is whether the fiberglass can be drilled for pilot holes or will it split? 
My idea is to glue the panels and then nail them with fasteners that have 
leak-proof washers. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your attachment plan is fine. If you nail right into the material you are 
using for the roof, it may be all right or it may chip a bit, depending on how 
careful you are and how much experience you have had in this kind of work. You 
are better off doing what you apparently contemplate -- drilling pilot holes. 
The fiberglass will not split. Follow the manufacturer's directions on how far 
apart the fasteners should be. Ask your dealer to sell you the special 
flashings that make the joints waterproof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bleaching Process Takes Double Step 
</P>
<P>
Q: After I had stripped the old finish off a piece of furniture, I discovered 
there was a mottled effect I could not remove with another varnish remover 
treatment. I read somewhere that the way to get the wood ready for refinishing 
is to bleach it. When this incident occurred, I read a book that dealt with 
bleaching. It called for a two-step bleach. Is that something special and where 
can I buy it? 
</P>
<P>
A: The regular commercial bleach is a two-step bleach. The bleach comes in two 
containers. Follow the directions on which to use first. In most cases, the 
application from the first bottle must be left on for a specified period -- 
let's say, 30 minutes -- and then wiped off. The contents of the second bottle 
usually can be left on for as long as needed, but follow the manufacturer's 
instructions. Be especially cautious about how and with what the residue must 
be wiped off. Remember, bleach is a powerful substance or it would not lighten 
the wood, so handle it with care. Wear rubber gloves and protect your eyes. 
Once the bleach has done its work and you are satisfied with the result, apply 
a wood sealer before you put on stain or any finishing material. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skylights Can Help Bring Light to Attic 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are going to finish our attic soon and get the use of a couple of extra 
bedrooms. It isn't very light up there now, and we are considering having a 
dormer built on one side. The price of the project has scared us a little, and 
we are wondering whether there is any alternative. We don't need a dormer for 
extra space, merely for extra light. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: Look into the possibility of obtaining the needed light with one or two 
skylights built into the roof. Some of the modern skylights are very attractive 
and add to overall appearance as well as furnishing extra light. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Be Extremely Careful When Shingling Roof 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our roof must be reshingled soon. I plan on doing it myself. I have had some 
experience on roofs, although I have never put on shingles. Is there anything I 
should know? 
</P>
<P>
A: A hundred things. Here are a few of them. Be sure to wear construction-type 
shoes with rubber soles. Do the work on a day when it is warm but not hot. Stay 
off the roof if the weather is even a tiny bit wet. Secure ladders top and 
bottom and keep the roof surface free of debris. Watch out for power lines. 
Keep people away from the work area. And don't get on the roof unless you are 
sure of your footing.

New York City is getting a "dockominium" with 26 watery parking spaces that 
will be priced from $600,000 to $2 million each. 
</P>
<P>
The spaces are at North Cove Yacht Harbor, a 3.75-acre man-made cove off the 
Hudson River. North Cove is a U-shaped notch in Manhattan's Battery Park City, 
a community of office towers and apartment buildings constructed on landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to open in June, the harbor will accommodate yachts at least 100 feet 
long and will have electrical, telephone and cable television connections, 
fresh water, sewage collection and concierge service. 
</P>
<P>
Until condominium plans are approved by the state, slips will be leased for 
seven-year periods. The longest, 155 feet, will cost about $1.6 million over 
seven years. The shortest, 80 feet, will lease for $565,000. The rates have 
been described as two or three times higher than those charged at the area's 
other leading marinas. 
</P>
<P>
John Gavin, former U.S. ambassador to Mexico and chairman of the company 
building the marina, said the public will be allowed to get up close to the 
yachts. There will be security, but there will be no gates or fences. 
</P>
<P>
The rich don't resent such intrusion in the Mediterranean, he added.

Thanks to a building-boom generated vacancy factor, office space in Orange 
County is less expensive than it was three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The county's average monthly lease rate per square foot was $1.65 in the fourth 
quarter of 1988, according to Coldwell Banker. The rate was $1.67 in the fourth 
quarter of 1985 and $1.73 in the fourth quarter of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The office vacancy factor was 21.7% in the fourth quarter of 1988 -- up from 
15.1% in 1985, according to the commercial realty firm, with 3.6 million square 
feet of space under construction in a market where existing space totals 45.4 
million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar had the highest average lease rate in Orange County, $2.25 per 
square foot per month, Coldwell Banker reported. Fountain Valley and Yorba 
Linda tied for least expensive, with an average of 95 cents.

WHITTIER COLLEGE TRIMS LAYOFF PLAN AS FISCAL OUTLOOK GROWS BRIGHTER

<TEXT>
<P>
The fiscal outlook at Whittier College has brightened since December, prompting 
officials to scale back plans to eliminate as many as a dozen faculty positions 
to balance next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the college's improved budget projections to stepped-up 
fund raising, an 18% increase in student applications and tighter budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan 2 Layoffs 
</P>
<P>
Still, the college will lay off two faculty members -- one each in the 
mathematics and drama departments -- when the school year ends in June. It has 
eliminated three other faculty positions that were not filled. On the 
administrative side, six staff members were laid off last month and another 
seven positions, which were not filled, were eliminated from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe the college's budget problems this year, in part, were an 
aftershock of the October, 1987, earthquake, which triggered a significant drop 
in freshman enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The campus suffered only minor damage from the quake but the surrounding area 
of Whittier suffered heavily and freshman class enrollment at the college 
dropped to 256 last September from 336 the year before, according to Admissions 
Director Katy Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, said Susan Pearce, vice president for college advancement, cost 
the college $1 million -- $500,000 to repair damage not covered by insurance 
and $500,000 in lost tuition from the drop in enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the quake and enrollment, Murphy said, is best 
demonstrated by the drop in applications from California students who went 
shopping for colleges last spring, after the quake. "California students 
typically visit and spend more time up town," Murphy said, referring to the 
commercial area of Whittier that is closest to campus and suffered the most 
quake damage. When they saw rubble and barriers blocking off dangerous areas, 
she said, high school seniors that might have attended Whittier went elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Applications are up this spring, however, Murphy said. The college has received 
940 applications, compared to 792 at the same time last year and 910 at the 
same time in 1987. "We are right now ahead of two years ago which (was) our 
largest year in 10 years (in terms of applications and admissions)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Smith, president of the Faculty Senate, said: "I think, frankly, that we 
were hit seriously by the earthquake and had a one-year drop (in enrollment) 
and now we're back up where we were two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimistic on Finances 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who is also chairman of the mathematics department, served on the 
committee that helped decide what faculty cuts would be made. He says he 
doesn't see an extremely extra heavy workload for the remaining academics and 
he is optimistic about finances. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I'm not too worried," he said when asked to assess the college's 
future financial health. "The budget we put together, if the enrollment 
predictions hold, we should be in very good shape next year. We simply need to 
push enrollment and the number of new students coming in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the college's vice president for finance and administration, Joseph E. 
Cardoza, who delivered the bad budget news in December, was sounding upbeat 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a really positive upswing on the admissions side," said Cardoza, who 
came to Whittier from Pomona College, which is part of the Claremont Colleges. 
"What really was significant was the 1987 earthquake, which caused us to take a 
very close look at all our forecasting," Cardoza said. "We're not looking to 
(make any more cuts) right now. We believe that we have taken the appropriate 
action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To balance its budget each year, Cardoza acknowledged, the college has been 
dipping into its $5-million reserve, which is now depleted and must be 
replenished, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Whittier has been dipping into its reserves, said Pearce, 
the college's fund-raising director, is because it has been making some heavy 
investments over the past decade. Its strong liberal arts program, which pairs 
unrelated classes in order to highlight possible similarities, was begun seven 
years ago and won the college plaudits from U.S. News and World Report, which 
for the last two years has named Whittier one of the top five small colleges in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier also took over the former Beverly School of Law, turning it from a 
nonaccredited institution, Pearce said, into a law school that is accredited by 
the American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real cost to that," she said. "In order to have accreditation, you 
have to have a full library. It's a very costly procedure in terms of a 
curriculum, the facility and the library, so, money was spent on that." 
</P>
<P>
The board of trustees has made undergraduate enrollment at the college a 
priority, said Chairman Rayburn S. Dezember. A study ordered by the board found 
that an enrollment of 1,200 would allow the college to operate most 
efficiently, Dezember said. About 950 full-time students now attend Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Except for last year, when it fell to 256, the college's freshman class has 
been increasing steadily over the past five years. In 1985, the class had 283 
members. In 1987 there were 332, and Murphy says she is expecting at least 320 
freshmen next year. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Whittier's enrollment surge is due to its good press notices, including 
two years of praise from U.S. News and World Report, faculty and administrators 
acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"The college has been a well-kept secret for years," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Both administrators and faculty, however, echoed the sentiments expressed last 
week by Whittier's incoming President James L. Ash, who said Whittier faces the 
same set of problems encountered by every other small private college in the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Compete 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that the number of 18-year-olds in the nation has dropped over 
the past decade and colleges must compete aggressively to attract students. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and Pearce acknowledged that Whittier operates with a tight budget 
because it devotes a higher proportion of its funds to scholarships and has a 
higher proportion of students receiving some sort of financial aid than other 
colleges. But students receiving financial aid are bringing money to the 
college, too, because much of the aid is from federal and state educational 
grants and loans, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier also has a meager endowment, only about $16 million for a school of 
approximately 1,000 undergraduates. By comparison, Pomona College, with 1,400 
undergraduates, has an endowment of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Endowment is one of our fund-raising priorities," said Pearce, who came to 
Whittier last June from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where 
she had worked in fund raising for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising appeals that went out after the layoff announcement generated a 
very good response from alumni donors, Pearce said. Contributions so far this 
year, she said, are $1.2 million ahead of those a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Our alumni base," she said of Whittier, "is among the most loyal I have ever 
seen."

<P>
AS MENTORS, COLLEGE STUDENTS REACH OUT TO YOUNG BLACKS IN HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The assignment -- to list three personal strengths or successes -- drew jokes 
from the other students. Monica Geary had just one question. 
</P>
<P>
"You only want three?" the Anaheim High School junior asked, ready to supply 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Fields scribbled "girls" on a sheet of notebook paper and held it up 
for a buddy to appreciate. When pressed, however, he grew serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm good with computers," Fields said. "And nowadays, you have to know about 
computers to get a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Self-examination, often cloaked in humor, is an important part of the lunchtime 
meetings between about 20 black students at Anaheim High School and three black 
mentors, who are undergraduates from Cal State Fullerton. It is also a rare 
chance for the high school group, which includes about half of the Anaheim 
school's black enrollment, to be a majority within the student body of 2,100. 
</P>
<P>
"White students treat me like a black person," 17-year-old Geary explained. 
"Black people just see me as a person." 
</P>
<P>
For black teen-agers, attending school in predominantly white Orange County can 
be an isolating experience. Blacks represent an estimated 1.6% of the county 
population, and there are few local role models, teachers or others of the same 
race to offer encouragement and a sense of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
Black undergraduates from Cal State Fullerton hope to fill that void and, not 
incidentally, bring more minority students to their university. As part of a 
mentor program begun last fall, Cal State Fullerton student teams go to four 
Orange County high schools twice a month to befriend black students and help 
them prepare for both the personal and academic rigors of college. 
</P>
<P>
The participating schools -- Buena Park High, Fullerton High, Anaheim High and 
Valencia High in Placentia -- each have a black enrollment of less than 2%, 
according to Thomas Coley, the architect of Cal State Fullerton's program. 
</P>
<P>
The minority mentoring program is one of a handful operating in Orange County 
under the state Student Opportunity and Access Program and through colleges and 
universities including UC Irvine, Fullerton College and Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
Mentoring within the Cal State Fullerton program works in three ways: It is 
intended to forge bridges between the college mentors and the high school 
students, to help the mentors form friendships among their peers and to help 
the mentors develop leadership skills and succeed at Cal State Fullerton. Black 
business leaders also help the high school and college students prepare for 
career demands during monthly forums. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program, initiated by Cal State Fullerton President Jewel Plummer 
Cobb, grew out of concern over a drop in black enrollment in the School of 
Business Administration and Economics from 2.7% in 1980 to 2% in 1986. Total 
black enrollment at the university last fall was 588, about 2.4% of the 24,700 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Grants totaling $30,000 from the Educational Foundation for Black Americans in 
Long Beach and the 21st Century Foundation in New York provide $900 
scholarships for 12 undergraduate mentors and also pay for campus excursions 
for the high school students. 
</P>
<P>
The mentors meet with John Lafky, Cal State Fullerton program coordinator, 
before each high school session to prepare discussion topics, such as college 
admission requirements, career planning, personal values and college life. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to provide supports," said Coley, who has a Ph.D. in educational 
administration and is executive assistant to Cobb. "This program gives the 
mentors a positive network of friends and gets them involved in something on 
this commuter campus. It also helps the high school students to see that 
college is a possibility, and not to see high school as the end, or maybe not 
even get through high school." 
</P>
<P>
Coley said he recognizes how difficult the "sense of aloneness" can be for 
minority individuals in an over-whelmingly non-minority environment, 
particularly as they try to fit in at a large and unfamiliar school. 
</P>
<P>
Coley, who is black, attended segregated schools in St. Augustine, Fla., before 
moving at age 15 to an integrated community in New Jersey. From there, he went 
to Moorhead State College in northern Minnesota, where there were 76 blacks 
among 4,000 undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably the first black person that some students at Moorhead had ever 
seen in their lifetime," Coley said. "Already as a black person, you stand out 
as different in that kind of environment. Who needs that burden when you have 
to maintain a level of academic competitiveness?" 
</P>
<P>
Milton King, a mentor at Fullerton High School, said he recalls his first few 
weeks at Cal State Fullerton as being stressful. But King said race had little 
to do with his unease. A junior marketing major, he is president of the 
university's Black Business School Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little bit frightening," he said. "Cal State Fullerton seemed like 
such a large place, and to not know anyone was a big change from high school, 
where I knew everyone. I think it helps the high school students to hear from 
people who have already made the transition." 
</P>
<P>
For Anthony Elliot, a Cal State Fullerton history student who plans to become a 
teacher, his work on the mentoring team at Anaheim High School "is great 
experience -- it will look great on my resume." He estimated that five of the 
20 to 25 students in the Anaheim group will choose to attend college at the 
Fullerton campus. 
</P>
<P>
Monique Johnson, another mentor at Anaheim, advised the teen-agers during a 
recent session to consider a fall-back career when they choose their college 
major. She also told them not to hesitate to seek tutoring if they believe they 
are falling behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at the begining of the program, the high school students saw this as a 
way to get out of class," said Johnson, a business administration and criminal 
justice major at Fullerton. "Now, they miss us if we skip a session, like over 
Christmas break. They are using us as examples." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the high school students don't understand the skills they need to 
succeed in college, Johnson said. Others assert lofty goals without any idea of 
how to achieve them. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the boys said they want to be professional sports stars, and one 
girl said she wants to be a lawyer but doesn't know what it takes. Another 
student said he is "doing good in school," and added, "I'm passing all of my 
classes except two." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, are strong students with clear goals. Monica Geary, who listed 
her strengths as "creativity, ambition and determination," said she wants to be 
an interior designer and plans to enroll in a Los Angeles design school when 
she graduates from Anaheim High next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The mentor program has brought me closer to the other black students in my 
school and it has really made me think about my college choices," she said. 
"The mentors are really here for us as a shoulder to lean on, or an adviser. It 
is a lot easier to talk to them because they're not that much older." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Fields predicted that more of his black classmates at Anaheim will go 
on to college because of the mentor program. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a better idea of what college is all about," he said. "I want to 
study engineering and science, and I know I can ask the mentors for advice." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students in the mentor programs have no one else to ask about 
college, because they may be the first in their families to consider higher 
education, according to Anaheim Principal Maggie Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
"The college mentors are sharing their success and some of the potential 
obstacles," she said. "It also reinforces the possibilities that exist for the 
students if they start planning early in their high school careers. I think a 
program like this would be a benefit to all kids."

On Saturday, a group appointed by the Board of Supervisors to seek a new county 
airport site will narrow the list to four or five. The selection of a final 
site is due in the fall. The county wants to open a new facility to supplement 
the existing John Wayne Airport, which has a limit on the number of daily 
flights.

A LESSON LEARNED FROM THE MONORAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times had a nice editorial (March 21) about the traffic situation in 
Phoenix. It seems that part of the people there want a lot more freeways and a 
lot more of them do not want any more. We have a remarkable mess in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties and it could very easily have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
I worked at Disneyland for a few years along about the time the cute little 
monorail from the hotel over to the park was put together. It has been doing 
its job right along since it started. At the time it got going, word was passed 
around that the Alweg company from Sweden would like to put in a similar rail 
line all over L.A. and Orange counties -- at no cost to the taxpayers! They 
would take care of the financing and after it was operating, the fares would 
pay the whole cost. 
</P>
<P>
The whole idea got swept under the carpet before the news ever got around to 
the public. The gasoline companies, the tire companies, the automobile dealers 
and the bus builders sort of all got together and solved the whole problem. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the auto companies have been rolling in surplus money, buying up 
land all over this area and investing in buildings and resorts. The nearest 
officeholders can come to making a good transportation system is to dig through 
a really dangerous natural gas area for that subway to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
An overhead monorail would not pollute the air as it is now. This proposed line 
would not absorb all of the people who travel on our freeways, but it would no 
doubt cut car traffic down to half.

<P>
AS THE HAPLESS LINE UP FOR FOOD, THE FOCUS ON THEIR PLIGHT SHARPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GILDA FEHR, Gilda Fehr of Orange is a member of the current Orange County 
Grand Jury. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There I was living in the rarefied atmosphere of my inflated ivory tower from 
where I could view all of Orange County's issues in stark black and white. I 
was certain I could tell all the bad guys from all the good guys. 
</P>
<P>
But then I descended into the catacombs of the County Courthouse where the 
Orange County Grand Jury is housed, and I was given the opportunity as a grand 
juror to look at the big picture. Even on a clear day, it is not a pretty 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Here the major concerns revolve around overcrowded jails, air quality, water 
shortages, waste disposal, budget deficits and airport overrides, not to 
mention growth and gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Something was missing. So, at the start of my 1-year term last June as an 
official county watchdog, I decided to join the Human Services Committee 
studying homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, these very real people came sharply into focus. It was easy enough 
to relate to their need for food, shelter, clothing, medical assistance and 
some kind of income (not necessarily in that order). Essentially, this is 
called survival. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is one responsibility to gather cold facts for a final report to the 
Board of Supervisors and another to translate those facts into warm bodies 
(which many of them weren't this past winter). Fortunately, I found a partial 
response to illuminating a small segment of the problem right in my own back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
Mary, the grand jury secretary for the past 12 years, had a pile of blankets in 
one corner and a stack of canned goods in the other when I entered the office 
for typing help. The outpouring of donations had come, she explained, from her 
friends in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes viewed as less than sympathetic, they included marshals, bailiffs and 
prosecutors from the tough criminal justice system. Then I learned that Mary 
spent one of her days off going to the park to feed the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
So I followed her one Sunday to a small park in Garden Grove. Waiting on one 
side of the table were the men, women and children, temporarily down on their 
luck. The line seemed endless, but the efficient and fast food operation was 
over in less than an hour and no one went away hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting recent statistics, there was an increased number of young couples 
and mothers with small children lined up with the people one sees, only if one 
looks, on all the street corners of every busy intersection in all the county's 
28 cities. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing the hungry and the homeless just as their neighbors was the handful of 
volunteers in charge of dishing up the salad and ladling out the homemade soup. 
They are unique, because they have no official name and they don't represent 
any established group. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, they've been operating for the past 2 1/2 years by word of hungry 
mouth. They don't solicit funds, but they raise conscience levels. If they have 
a credo, it's that they don't serve any food in the park that they wouldn't 
give their own families. 
</P>
<P>
Heading up the loose-knit organization is an older couple on a fixed income who 
have learned the hard way to measure generosity not in terms of what one gives 
but what is left over. They know that often in California, the only place 
"family ties" exist is on television. They are aware that even picnic tables 
can turn and they could, one day, find themselves on the other side. There's a 
fine line between Orange County's would-be and could-be homeless. 
</P>
<P>
So they stand and serve the guy from the car wash who lost a week's pay because 
of the rain. And the couple who can't afford to pay 60% of their combined 
minimum wage income on housing, even if they could find it. And the single 
mother whose night-cashier job doesn't qualify her for welfare or leave enough 
to feed her 6- and 7-year-old daughters either. 
</P>
<P>
It's for these working poor and countless others that the food providers have 
asked their City Council for a patio cover over the picnic tables. 
Symbolically, it will be a roof over their heads and that of the people they 
feed. City officials are supportive, but they worry about both liability, in 
case of contaminated food, and a number of complaints from nearby residents 
about transients in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as in other situations where NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) surfaces, the 
argument becomes ludicrous. Authorities fear that if the roof is flat, the 
homeless might climb up there to sleep. However, if it is sloped, there will be 
no problem because anyone climbing up there would fall to the ground. Or slip 
through the cracks, in bureaucratic lingo. 
</P>
<P>
In plain talk, these days few cities appear willing to run the risk of being 
labeled compassionate. They fear this will only attract hordes of the hungry 
and changing community attitudes doesn't happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
If volunteerism at the grass-roots level is on shaky turf, I have to wonder 
where the people fed in the Garden Grove park on Sundays go for a warm meal the 
rest of the week.

GIFTS TO COUNTY'S 13 LEGISLATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to The Times' article "Gifts to 13 County Legislators Totaled 
$116,339 in 1987 and '88," I find it hard to take the interviewed legislators 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad), for example, who enjoyed two free 
nights in a Palm Desert condominium owned by a developer who was sponsoring 
legislation last year (legislation that Frazee supported but claimed he was for 
"all along" anyway), says he holds to the philosophy of the late Jesse Unruh: 
"You should be able to take these kinds of things and not let it affect you. 
That's the measure of a good legislator." 
</P>
<P>
It may well have been that Unruh was above corruption by enticements, but few 
people, certainly not most politicians, can claim such sterling integrity. 
</P>
<P>
It's simply human nature, like it or not, to be affected favorably by people 
who treat us with favor. Obvious as that truth is, politicians like Frazee 
persist in pretending it's just not so. Gifts of all kinds are rationalized in 
as many ways almost as there are politicians themselves, the most popular 
rationale being "fact finding" or "information gathering. 
</P>
<P>
That's how one lumber company wrapped its gift to Assemblyman Ross Johnson 
(R-La Habra) and others, of a relaxing fishing expedition in Humboldt County in 
December -- a trip that included a company-owned bed-and-breakfast inn, among 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), a little more concerned with 
appearances than Johnson, takes care to stress "a lot of time" was spent 
finding out about issues relevant to California regarding her trip to New 
Zealand, courtesy of oil and chemical companies. Yet surprisingly (or maybe 
not, considering the presumption of many politicians), she later expresses 
bewilderment about why the press and public pay so much attention to annual 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, I can already hear Bergeson and countless other politicians who 
read The Times, muttering in disgust about the "nit-picking of the press" and 
the naivete of the public who just "doesn't understand how government works." 
Well, we're learning, and the most important thing we're learning is that 
whether we're talking about churches, schools or the Legislature, the name of 
the game these days is accountability. 
</P>
<P>
If it takes the bill of Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), which would, 
among other things, ban gifts and honorariums valued at more than $50, to keep 
legislators more accountable to their constituency, so be it. No, it won't 
prove to be a panacea, but it could well be a step in the right direction.

ASSAULT RIFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is to answer Ann Cox-Clasby of Laguna Beach about her comments on 
state Sen. David A. Roberti's bill on assault rifles (March 19): 
</P>
<P>
Fully automatic firearms have been outlawed by the federal government for at 
least four decades. Guess what: The criminals and drug dealers have them 
anyway. Illegal arms come into this country just like cocaine does: by the ton. 
It has also been against federal law to modify a semiautomatic weapon into a 
fully automatic one. Guess what: The criminals and drug dealers do it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The laws already exist to deter the criminal, but they are not enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Disarming the law-abiding citizen is unconstitutional, illogical and won't even 
slow down the killing.

LAGUNA CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The residents of 890 acres in Laguna Canyon and the city of Laguna Beach have 
cooperatively agreed upon the desire for official connection through 
annexation. The only stumbling block is the Local Agency Formation Commission's 
sudden condition with respect to imposing, as a term of annexation approval, a 
requirement by the city to collect transportation corridor fees. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach has long been on record as opposing the San Joaquin Hills Tollway 
Corridor. To require this condition asks residents to compromise their 
principles in a most serious way. 
</P>
<P>
The condition is thoroughly unreasonable and unethical. In fact, I find the 
imposed condition devious, deplorable and a wretched example of the misuse of 
political power by an official government agency that is supposed to serve the 
welfare of unincorporated residents. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, LAFCO meets to determine the fate of Laguna Canyon residents. In 
light of The Times' recent disclosures of gift-getting politicians, I wonder if 
we can hope for any impartiality with respect to decisions that ultimately 
affect us. Is it too much to hope for a meticulously honest outcome to the 
Laguna Canyon annexation issue?

PROBLEMS CAUSED BY BALBOA CRUISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I live on the Balboa peninsula, a residential community now in its third year 
under siege by the out-of-town adolescent scofflaws known as "cruisers." They 
swarm through our neighborhoods, creating chaos and gridlock with impunity. Our 
homes are rocked by the outlandish din of their thundering stereos, blaring 
horns, roaring engines, snarling motorcycles, screeching brakes, piercing 
whistles and maniacal shrieks, screams and howls. 
</P>
<P>
Our city authorities, who welcomed the vanguard of the youthful invaders in the 
spring of 1986 with assurances that they wanted "everybody to have a good time" 
and wouldn't "rain on anyone's parade," have steadfastly refused to take any 
effective action to discourage the "cruisers" and restore order. The 
installation of permanent Permit Only Lane traffic signs crushed whatever 
lingering hopes we residents harbored that the city administration would act to 
mitigate the preposterous, infuriating situation. 
</P>
<P>
Except for World War II Marine service and college out of state, I've been a 
part of Balboa virtually all my life. I've seen many changes over those years 
but nothing so devastating as the deterioration of the quality of life on the 
peninsula since the cruisers seized control. When we residents are permitted to 
come and go, enjoy a book or go to sleep is now determined by out-of-town 
hooligans. We seldom have visitors because few of our friends will suffer our 
blocked streets. Unless changes are made soon, I see Balboa becoming just 
another drug-ridden seaside slum. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa is virtually an American institution and its name evokes fond memories 
in countless thousands who have come here over the years. Its destruction now 
by the failure of one city administration to protect the rights of residents 
and law-abiding visitors would be a senseless tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Why our Newport Beach policy-makers have permitted bedlam and near-anarchy on 
the peninsula for 2 long years when we have an outstanding police force capable 
of restoring order defies all reason.

PARENTAL CONCERN ABOUT CLASSES ON SEX EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to much of what has recently been reported (or should I say 
"distorted") in the newspapers, there are a lot of parents and citizens within 
the community who are very concerned about the material being presented in the 
sex education classes within the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, and have 
every right to be concerned. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at the Newport-Mesa Unified School District board meeting Feb. 28, 19 
of the 31 people who spoke with regard to district family life and psychology 
curriculum were in favor of Ray Woolsey's proposals: that the school board 
adopt a defined sex education curriculum to be used throughout the district; 
that a parent-teacher committee be elected by the school board; that the 
elected parents of that committee be involved in the process of defining such 
sex education curriculum, and that the sex education curriculum be reviewed 
every 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with both state and federal law, parents do have inherent rights 
concerning what is taught to their children. 
</P>
<P>
There are many parents within the district who are very upset about what is 
being taught to their children, including openly discussing deviant sexual 
behavior (such as: bestiality, sex with children, sex with the dead, masochism, 
sex with foreign objects and transsexualism) within the high school classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their legitimate concern for the health and welfare of their 
children, they want to have a voice in what is being taught to their children. 
They want traditional values, including abstinence, to be taught as a part of 
the sex education curriculum within the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
I ask you, is this such an unreasonable request? After all, they are the 
parents.

NEW IRVINE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I thought that jails were the only institutions suffering from NIMBY (Not In My 
Back Yard) until I read the article about Irvine's residents opposing an 
educational institution (high school) in their residential tract. 
</P>
<P>
Education should be a wanted institution. Students are being sent the message 
that their institution of learning is detrimental to the neighborhood. Tustin 
spent considerable time mapping out its future growth in newly annexed East 
Tustin. With all the hoopla about Irvine being a planned city, they need to go 
back to the drafting table and work within their physical boundaries.

IDENTITY OF BIRDS IN PHOTOS HARD TO SWALLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your pictures of the birds (March 22) we see around Newport. I do 
have to say that the one pictured is not a tern but an American avocet. 
</P>
<P>
I was so enthralled by the wild birds I could see on the Back Bay where I live 
that I took two classes through Coastline College to be able to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
Terns dive for their food -- you never see them wading. They are the ones who 
fly overhead like the pelicans and then suddenly dive straight down into the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Avocets are a wading bird. They have long legs and a long bill turned up at the 
end, so you can tell from the silhouette what it is. They sweep their bill from 
side to side to get their food. 
</P>
<P>
I see so many birds wintering here and get an immense amount of enjoyment out 
of being able to identify the species. 
</P>
<P>
Enjoyed the pelicans and sea gulls today!

IDENTITY OF BIRDS IN PHOTOS HARD TO SWALLOW

<P>
I wonder how many comments you will receive about your error in bird 
identification (March 22)? 
</P>
<P>
The foraging shore bird you pictured, identified as "tern" bears no resemblance 
to a tern. Most likely it is an American avocet -- which, by strange 
coincidence, you have pictured in the same edition, in the sports section. 
</P>
<P>
Just wanted you to know we do read the paper carefully!

IDENTITY OF BIRDS IN PHOTOS HARD TO SWALLOW

<P>
Your recent article on the swallows returning to Capistrano included a photo 
showing some pigeons and another bird, supposedly a swallow, sitting on a bell 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
That was no swallow. It had the unmistakable silhouette of a starling. Also, 
from my experience, swallows seldom perch in places like this, preferring a 
power line or twig of a tree.

HOFFMANS USHERING IN NEW ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Glenn Hoffman was a kid, his old man, Ed, let him and his brothers convert 
a perfectly good back yard into a concrete basketball court and a lighted 
whiffleball stadium. Love and cement make a strange mix, but Ed was like that. 
</P>
<P>
When Glenn -- Anaheim born, Anaheim raised -- became an all-county infielder 
and Savanna High School basketball letterman, Ed attended every game he could. 
He wouldn't have had it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
And when Glenn was signed by the Boston Red Sox in 1976, Ed wished it had been 
the Angels who had drafted his son. But they didn't, so Ed became a Sox fan of 
sorts, which meant he had to watch what he said when Glenn came to town. Ed, 
after all, was an usher at Angel games, and who wants to be seated by some guy 
rooting for the visiting team? 
</P>
<P>
Now, 13 years later, Glenn Hoffman, the prodigal son, has returned home to play 
for the Angels. It wasn't easy; it wasn't even official until Friday afternoon, 
when Manager Doug Rader informed Hoffman that he had earned a place on the 
team's 24-man roster as a utility player. And wouldn't you know it: Ed was 
visiting the ballpark the same day his son got the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, what are the chances?" said Glenn. "You come in as a non-roster 
player. It just shows you that anything can happen. It's a weird game." 
</P>
<P>
Exasperating, too. For more than a decade, Ed Hoffman patrolled the aisles of 
Anaheim Stadium. He kept the peace. He greeted fans with a warm smile. He did 
all this with the slim hope that circumstances would someday bring Glenn and 
the Angels together. That way he could root for his son and the right team. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1986, Ed retired, figuring he had waited long enough for 
circumstances to see things his way. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? Glenn gets released by the Red Sox a year later and ends the 
season with the Dodgers. Then he spends the 1988 season with Boston's triple-A 
Pawtucket team. The Red Sox want Hoffman to return in 1989 -- as a triple-A 
coach, not major league player. Hoffman, 30, tells them he's too young to quit. 
</P>
<P>
And thus begins a series of telephone calls to teams across the country. In 
both leagues. On both coasts. When the Angels offered Hoffman a place on the 
Edmonton team and an invitation to spring training as a non-roster player, he 
happily accepted. It was either that or the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to let an opportunity go by," Hoffman 
said. "I figured that if we were going to (try out), it would be nice to do it 
at home." 
</P>
<P>
And if he bombed? 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would have gone into real estate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he overcame what once appeared to be an insurmountable lead by Dave 
Concepcion for the utility position. Rader had all but said that the job was 
Concepcion's for the taking. Problem was, Concepcion didn't take it; he gave it 
up with 40-year-old legs that could no longer jump or run, and 40-year-old 
hands that reacted a split-second too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hoffman did what he does best, which is plug along unspectacularly. 
Heavy on professionalism, light on mistakes is the Hoffman trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's the way I've played," he said. "I don't run real fast. I don't 
hit for a lot of power or do the flashy things, but I feel like I know how to 
play the game. I feel that's what has kept me around for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman began the spring wearing No. 62, which is great if you're an offensive 
guard, but terrible if you're an infielder looking for a full-time job in the 
big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's a uniform," said Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, he'd rather have No. 62 than a real estate license. 
</P>
<P>
But look how things worked out: Hoffman will begin the regular season Tuesday 
wearing No. 9, while Concepcion will be wearing street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"Davey was a good ballplayer," Hoffman said. "I just hope, like Rader said, 
that he hooks on somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
A witness, of course, to his son's rise and Concepcion's fall was none other 
than Ed Hoffman, who spent the spring driving from ballpark to ballpark, from 
Anaheim to Mesa, Mesa to Palm Springs and Palm Springs to Anaheim. At the time, 
you never knew if the next exhibition game might be Glenn's last, what with 
Concepcion's supposed edge. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to drive, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Hoffman has traveled across the country to see his son play. One time, he 
came courtesy of the Red Sox, who invited him to sing the national anthem on 
opening day of the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out that Haywood Sullivan, the chief executive officer of the Red Sox, 
had promised to arrange the whole thing if Glenn made an opening day roster. 
"And he kept his word," Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Red-carpet treatment," said Ed. 
</P>
<P>
But this is better. This is Hoffman playing in front of Hoffman. Making the 
homecoming even sweeter is the fact that no one expected it. 
</P>
<P>
"This," Glenn said, "is really special." 
</P>
<P>
From now on, complimentary tickets will be waiting for one Mr. Ed Hoffman at 
the Anaheim Stadium "Will Call" window, courtesy of Glenn. Ed had talked about 
requesting his old usher job back, but Glenn vetoed that idea. 
</P>
<P>
"You worked hard enough," he told him. 
</P>
<P>
The way Glenn figures it, Ed, 77, belongs in a seat, not on his feet. Thus, the 
freebies. 
</P>
<P>
Ed won't see his son play much. Utilitymen make infrequent appearances. They 
are baseball's repairmen: to be used only in emergency. 
</P>
<P>
But that's OK, Glenn said. "As a utility player, I feel like I'm trying to be 
the best one there is," he said. "It's not easy. I've talked to some people 
about it who say it's harder than playing every day." 
</P>
<P>
And you'll get no complaints from Ed, who would rather see his son sitting in 
the Angel dugout than no dugout at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I was walking on air," he said. "I couldn't be any happier." 
</P>
<P>
There is talk of Ed making another singing appearance, this one at Anaheim 
Stadium. It would be nice, but not necessary. Ed already got his wish: His son 
is back.

Condense 3 years' worth of boiler-room battle into one sentence and it would 
probably read something like this: Convictions keep coming, sentences get 
stiffer, but the problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
That's life with the Southern California Fraud Task Force, a group of 21 
federal, state and local law enforcement agencies charged with the Herculean 
job of stamping out telemarketing crime in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The group's 108-page annual report released last month paints a bittersweet 
picture of great success tempered with painful resignation. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side is the trend toward stiffer sentences, a practice that 
Robert C. Bonner, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, 
contends will have a great deterrent factor. Bonner kicks off the report by 
congratulating his department on the hefty sentences given of late to convicted 
con men. 
</P>
<P>
"Substantial custody sentences in telemarketing cases have become commonplace," 
Bonner says, as he goes on to compare the light punishments of 1986 with 
20-year sentences handed out in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
During 1986, the task force's first full year of operation, only four 
defendants in telemarketing cases were sentenced to 5 or more years in prison. 
In 1987, the report says, the number was the same: 4. 
</P>
<P>
But 1988 was a banner year for sentencing: 20 defendants received sentences of 
5 or more years. One of those con men was sentenced to 25 years, and three were 
given 20 years in prison, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
A page later, however, reality kicks in: 
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public continue to be defrauded by fast-talking swindlers who 
use the telephone to convey their pitches," Bonner writes. "The considerable 
coordinated efforts of all the above agencies have still not been able to stop 
a nationwide crisis where frauds emanating from Southern California now 
victimize the public of an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion a year." 
</P>
<P>
One problem, says Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz, the task force head, is the 
lack of resources and manpower. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement experts place California at the center of the telemarketing 
fraud map, but the annual report says that Southern California has only a third 
as many FBI agents as New York City and only half the number of federal 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of law enforcement resources is a key reason for the widespread 
descriptions of Southern California as 'the fraud capital of the world' and of 
the coastal area around Newport Beach as the 'Cote de Fraud,' " Katz says in 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
HOW SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE HAS FARED 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Fraud Task Force has been in operation for 3 years and 
takes credit for disposing of nearly 300 cases. Eight of those cases have yet 
to come to trial, according to the task force's annual report. Forty-seven 
others are either at the indictment stage or the defendants are fugitives. The 
convictions each year: 
</P>
<P>
1986 36 
</P>
<P>
1987 90 
</P>
<P>
1988 74 
</P>
<P>
1989 (to date) 14 
</P>
<P>
The task force also contends that sentences have gotten stiffer in the years 
that the group of agencies has been cooperating in the fight against 
telemarketing fraud. Following is the number of sentences of 5 years or more in 
each year the task force has been in operation:

LEVITICUS PROJECT: LATEST IN BOILER-ROOM BASHING

Joel and Todd Fisch taught G.W. McDonald an invaluable law-enforcement lesson. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of fleet-footed father-and-son swindlers, the Fisches became McDonald's 
professors of procedure, instructors in the need for interstate cooperation 
among investigators on the trail of telemarketing fraud. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald is chief of enforcement for the California Department of Corporations, 
and it took 4 years for him and a legion of law enforcement agents from two 
countries to bring the Fisches to justice. In that time, McDonald saw precious 
metals scams like the Fisch family's emerge as the fraud of choice among 
boiler-room operators. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the Fisch case in 1986, McDonald realized that California needed 
a new weapon to combat the growing threat to investors. This month, the state 
will unveil that latest addition to its boiler-room bashing arsenal: The 
Leviticus Project, a federal program named after the third book of the Bible, 
which states in part, "Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Todd and Joel Fisch opened up First Trading Group, an El Toro precious 
metals boiler room. "When we served a subpoena on them," McDonald said, "they 
tossed all their books in the back of five limousines and headed for British 
Columbia." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fisches Run Out of Vancouver 
</P>
<P>
They were run out of Vancouver by the widening telemarketing investigation, and 
their next stop was Bellevue, Wash. -- another city, another scam. The Fisches 
ended up in Miami, opening up their fourth precious metals boiler room in as 
many years, this one called Suisse Atlantique. 
</P>
<P>
All told, they bilked 1,600 investors out of $8.5 million before they were 
arrested in Miami in late 1986. Last April, a U.S. District judge in Los 
Angeles sentenced Todd Fisch to 20 years in a federal prison. Last October, 
Joel Fisch was sentenced to 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the Fisch case) indicates why you need multistate cooperation," McDonald 
said, "and it illustrates how long it takes to get these things done." 
</P>
<P>
Just weeks before Joel Fisch was sentenced, California became the 20th state to 
join the Leviticus Project, which gives interstate cooperation and federal 
grants to boiler-room investigations to help wipe out an array of interstate 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Leviticus officially began operating in 1980, with funding from the Department 
of Justice. But it was born in the Appalachian coal fields in 1977, when 
regulatory and law-enforcement agents from six coal-area states got together to 
battle criminal activity in the coal fields. 
</P>
<P>
The state of New York joined the group, too, said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman 
from the New York County district attorney's office, because "while we have no 
coal reserves, we had determined that a lot of the criminal activity ultimately 
led to Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
The Arab oil crises of the 1970s basically led to the formation of Leviticus, 
McKelvey said. During the crises, the federal government started emphasizing 
alternative forms of energy, and fraud in the coal fields ran rampant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Targets Frauds in Several Areas 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sales of fraudulent limited-partnership coal-mining ventures, 
Leviticus investigation targets included the theft of heavy equipment used in 
strip mining, frauds affecting financial institutions and boiler-room sales of 
fraudulent commodity futures in coal. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the group was merely an effort to coordinate investigations 
and share information among states to battle the coal problems. But in 1980, 
the group applied to an arm of the Department of Justice and received its first 
funding -- $1.5 million, McKelvey said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when an oil glut replaced the fuel crises of the 1970s, coal fraud 
largely abated. But what Leviticus officials saw led them to branch out instead 
of fold. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1984, we were starting to see the same principals from the coal cases move 
over to oil and gas fraud," said Jerry Conners, the Leviticus field service 
coordinator. "After a year, we were allowed to expand into the oil and gas 
industry. Last year, because of problems in the Western states, we were allowed 
to look into precious metals. On some occasions we saw the same people all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
This is how Leviticus works: A member organization targets an investigation 
that affects several states. Law enforcement agents from those states work 
together on the investigation and take the case as far as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Then the member agency in charge presents the case to the Leviticus board of 
directors, along with a pitch for money. If the case is accepted, the board 
will reimburse the chief agency for expenses such as flying in witnesses, 
investigators and experts from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The money is sorely needed, members say, because travel expenses and complex 
investigative accounting make interstate boiler-room cases some of the most 
costly to prosecute. Grants have run from as little as $150 for a single 
witness's plane ticket all the way up to about $100,000, Conners said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agencies Strapped for Resources 
</P>
<P>
State securities and law enforcement agencies say many cases will not be 
prosecuted without this money because investigating and prosecuting agencies 
are strapped for resources and manpower. They contend that the federal money is 
well spent by their agencies because their day-to-day dealings with fraud in 
the states take them closer to the problems than federal forces. 
</P>
<P>
Leviticus members are all state-level law enforcement agencies such as state 
police or securities commissions. Although there are 29 agencies from 20 states 
involved, membership has been frozen temporarily while project directors assess 
the group's growth. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Leviticus so effective, Conners said, is that "we don't just bring 
charges in one area. Say someone runs a boiler-room in Virginia and they're 
selling in California and Arizona and Texas. We plan on prosecuting in all 
those jurisdictions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding Level Is Confidential 
</P>
<P>
So far, it has worked. From 1980 through the end of February, Leviticus, whose 
funding level is confidential, has been involved in 206 cases, filed 1,375 
criminal counts against 393 individuals or corporations and 256 civil charges. 
The cases so far have been split evenly between oil and gas and coal; no 
precious metals cases have come to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
The project has led to $4.6 million in fines assessed by the courts and $5.6 
million in court-ordered restitution. Leviticus investigations have recovered 
$2 million in stolen equipment. And cases worth $439 million have been referred 
to the Internal Revenue Service, Conners said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Leviticus) have funded a huge number of cases over the years that have 
been successful in the coal and gas area," said California's McDonald. "I'm 
hopeful it can be as successful in precious metals." 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly why California, through the Department of Corporations, joined 
Leviticus last September. Of the 200 boiler rooms operating in Southern 
California today, the Southern California Fraud Task force figures that 70% are 
precious metals schemes of one sort or another. 
</P>
<P>
"The real purpose of this exercise is to get a handle on the boiler-room 
problem in Orange County," McDonald said. "Orange County is the hotbed of the 
problem. . . . The Orange County D.A.'s office is really overwhelmed. The 
county is growing so fast, and the D.A. has not kept up with the growth of the 
fraud down there." 
</P>
<P>
One reason precious metals fraud is so prevalent, law enforcement officials 
say, is that sale of such metals as gold and silver often falls into a 
regulatory gray area. Sale of gold coins, for example, is considered a 
"cash-and-carry" transaction rather than an investment, and, as such, it is 
unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
California courts in 1986 and 1987 ruled that gold-in-the-ground operations do 
not fall under securities laws because they are merely prepayment plans for an 
item to be delivered in the future -- a normal consumer transaction, not an 
investment. In such schemes, swindlers persuade investors to buy rights to ore 
on the promise that it contains guaranteed levels of gold. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the court rulings, McDonald said, as many as 30 to 40 other 
scams have switched to gold-in-the-ground since the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two court decisions had the effect of creating a sanctuary, a haven for 
telemarketing con artists in California," said Scott Stapf, director of 
investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Assn. "They 
just literally cracked open a loophole that's as big as California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Receives Funding 
</P>
<P>
California began applying for -- and receiving -- Leviticus funding in 
February. Investigations are proceeding, and law-enforcement officials hope 
that several should come to fruition this month. So far it is too soon to say 
whether this new weapon will work for the nation's boiler-room capital. 
</P>
<P>
For New Mexico, which has received more than $100,000 in Leviticus funds, the 
program has yet to pan out. 
</P>
<P>
"Positive results are slow in coming," said a cautious John Hiatt. "In part, 
that must be a result of having to deal with another level of government. We 
have had no convictions yet. Our investigations are still pending." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri, however, has had better luck. John Perkins, the state's commissioner 
of securities, likes to tell the tale of Lester Eugene Chapman to illustrate 
the power of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman operated a boiler room from British Columbia and sold interests in oil 
and gas leases, what Perkins characterized as unregistered securities. Chapman 
had the ill fate of selling a lease interest to a doctor in Callaway County, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether fraud is involved, selling unregistered securities is a 
felony in Missouri. The doctor complained to Perkins' office, which worked with 
securities regulators in British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri officials tracked Chapman down, filed charges against him, and dragged 
him back to their state. But when the case was ready to go to trial, Chapman's 
attorney refused to have him plead guilty, arguing that there was no way the 
Missouri prosecutor could prove that Chapman was the man who sold the 
securities to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transactions Made Over Phone 
</P>
<P>
The reason was that the transactions were made over the telephone, and the 
doctor never saw the man who bilked him. But when Chapman was arrested in 
Canada, Perkins said, he confessed to selling securities without being 
registered. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this guy (Chapman) was convinced that there was no way Callaway County 
could actually bring in the witness from British Columbia necessary to convict 
him," Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Leviticus provided about $1,000 in travel money, and the witness got on the 
plane in time for the Feb. 2 trial. 
</P>
<P>
"When the defendant saw the guy was here," Perkins said, "he pleaded guilty to 
six counts of violating Missouri security law minutes before the trial began. 
That's the kind of thing Leviticus can do."

INVESTIGATOR FOUND SWARMS OF CON MEN OPERATING IN COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
California can thank John B. Hiatt, director of the New Mexico's state 
Securities Division, for pushing precious metals into the Leviticus Project 
fold and giving the Golden State another weapon with which to fight fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Around 1987, Hiatt began noticing so-called "gold-in-the-ground" schemes 
popping up in his home state. In gold-in-the-ground operations, also known as 
dirt-pile schemes, swindlers use official-looking mineral assay tests to 
convince investors that the ore they have laid claim to contains guaranteed 
levels of gold. 
</P>
<P>
For an initial investment of about $5,000, investors are told they hold title 
to 100 tons of unprocessed dirt. The con men then tell the investors that the 
gold found in that dirt will be sold to them at as low as one-third of the 
world spot market price. In reality, there is no mine, no ore, no gold. 
</P>
<P>
Investor complaints and a serious warning from New Mexico's state geologist 
about the abundance of gold-mine fraud led Hiatt to talk to colleagues in other 
Western mining states, California chief among them. Hiatt got a $32,000, 
18-month grant from the North American Securities Administrators Assn. and went 
to work on Operation Goldbrick. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought there were four to six (gold mine schemes) in New Mexico and perhaps 
another eight to 10 in neighboring states for a total of 15 to 20," Hiatt said. 
"There are currently 80 to 100. . . . The promoters operating the boiler rooms 
are primarily located in California, Orange County, Newport Beach. And they're 
calling all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
Among the con men unearthed in Operation Goldbrick was Gordon MacManus, a 
persistent man from Casper, Wyo. MacManus was sentenced in 1987 to 2 1/2 years 
in a Wyoming prison after pleading guilty to bilking at least 40 persons out of 
$6,250 each for worthless dirt from an inactive mine. 
</P>
<P>
According to NAASA officials, MacManus was moved to solitary confinement in the 
state penitentiary last fall, after he was accused of promoting yet another 
gold-in-the-ground scheme -- this time from inside prison walls. 
</P>
<P>
NAASA figures that in 1988, tens of thousands of American investors lost an 
estimated $250 million to gold-in-the-ground schemes alone. That number doesn't 
even begin to factor in the other precious metals scams: rare coins, strategic 
metals, gold and silver futures, bullion. 
</P>
<P>
It was these Western precious metals problems, highlighted by the rapid growth 
of Operation Goldbrick, that led Leviticus to add precious metals fraud to its 
list of targets.

STOCK WATCH: BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS STOCK MOVES UP AS INVESTORS WEIGH MERGER 
SCENARIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There aren't many of them out there -- yet -- but the 300 or so shareholders of 
Beckman Instruments must have been dancing in the streets Friday as the thinly 
traded stock finished the week at $22.125 a share, up an impressive $2.875, or 
15%. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 62,200 shares of the Fullerton-based scientific and medical 
diagnostic instruments company changed hands Friday. 
</P>
<P>
All week, Beckman Instrument shares have been rising in lock-step on the New 
York Stock Exchange with those of parent company SmithKline Beckman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.3 million shares of SmithKline Beckman were traded Friday. The stock 
closed at $60.375 a share, up $4.75 for the day and $7.50, or 14.2%, for the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of both companies, it seems, are benefiting from merger mania. 
</P>
<P>
Beecham Group PLC, a British medical supplies firm, has talked to 
Philadelphia-based SmithKline Beckman about merging the two companies' 
prescription drug businesses and selling off the nonconforming parts -- pieces 
that would include Beckman Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
When word of that leaked out Wednesday, along with news that Beckman 
Instruments had adopted a poison pill takeover defense, the stock of both 
companies started climbing. 
</P>
<P>
And when Beecham announced Friday that it had retained Wasserstein Perella 
&amp; Co, a New York mergers and acquisitions firm, SmithKline Beckman and 
Beckman Instruments shares really took off. 
</P>
<P>
But why are Beckman Instrument's shares soaring at the same fevered pace as its 
parent's, especially since SmithKline Beckman owns 86% of Beckman Instruments 
and there are only about 300 other shareholders? 
</P>
<P>
Opinion on the street is pretty unanimous: Beckman Instruments, acquired by 
SmithKline in 1982 in a $1-billion tax-free exchange of stock, is destined to 
strike out on its own again. 
</P>
<P>
The only real questions seem to be how soon it will happen and what form the 
parting of the ways will take. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline Beckman started the speculation late last year when, as part of a 
corporate reorganization aimed at slapping some life into the anesthetized 
pharmaceuticals segment of the company, it said it would consider selling off 
part or all of several of its units, including Beckman Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was inaugurated when 4.5 million shares of Beckman Instruments common 
stock were sold to public investors, with SmithKline Beckman retaining 24 
million shares. The stock closed at $19 a share Nov. 4, 1988, its first day 
back on the street since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
One longtime industry analyst, who asked to remain unnamed, said that if 
Beecham merges with SmithKline Beckman, the combined company is likely to 
tender for the Beckman Instruments shares now traded publicly. The intent, said 
the analyst, would be to give the parent 100% of Beckman Instruments so it 
would have a whole pie to sell, rather than one with a big slice missing. 
</P>
<P>
The difficult thing is assessing just what this means to investors and 
potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
Because Beckman Instruments stock has only been traded for the past 5 months, 
few analysts are up to speed on the company. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it is difficult to find anyone who is comfortable categorizing the 
current trading price as too much, not enough, or just right. 
</P>
<P>
One industry watcher, Julian Menear of Pershing &amp; Co.'s Chicago office, 
said he thinks that Beckman has been without its independence for too long to 
make a big splash if it is cut loose. "It won't have the resources to compete, 
and it won't have the financial wherewithal of a larger parent to fall back on. 
It will have a tough first few years." 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments, Menear said, "has very good management that knows the 
business inside out, but technology cycles so fast nowadays that having been 
independent 6 years ago is like having been independent 6 centuries ago. The 
capital and equipment demands are so much greater now because the market is 
quicker and more sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
But Kurt Kruger, a New York-based medical technology analyst for Hambrecht 
&amp; Quist, a San Francisco investments firm, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments, he said, "is very viable as an independent. It makes great 
sense for it to be separate and, as I hear from competitors in the industry, 
like Hewlett Packard and Millipore, Beckman actually is doing quite well. Its 
fundamental business looks quite healthy." 
</P>
<P>
The company -- which posted a profit in 1988 of $42.5 million, up 9%, on sales 
of $770 million, up 11% for the year -- does about half its business in 
analytical instrumentation and half in health care diagnostic instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The analytical instruments business has gone through a depression recently, 
Kruger said, "but Beckman's products have gained in sales." 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments as an independent also would have the advantage of size. It 
would tower over most players in the analytical instrument field, where only 
nine companies now have sales in excess of $250 million a year, Kruger said. 
</P>
<P>
And its stock, he said, should be worth a lot more on its own than bundled with 
SmithKline Beckman's.
