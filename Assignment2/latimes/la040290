SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NOVELIST SPREADS HIS WORD VIA THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Marx says he takes inspiration from Thomas Paine and Ayn Rand. Also, 
Fuller Brush and the Avon Lady. 
</P>
<P>
Marx, 38, is selling novels door-to-door. His own, self-published novels: "A 
War Ends" and "Eric Greenfield -- Middle American." 
</P>
<P>
He spends the early mornings writing in his sunny condominium in Cardiff, 
overlooking San Elijo Lagoon. Then he hits the streets in search of sales. 
</P>
<P>
It's his way of avoiding the runaround of agents, editors and publishers. The 
do-it-yourself mode also fits his views on liberty and individualism. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric Greenfield" is filled with characters like Bella Absurd, George 
MustGovern, Shirley Mindslame, Eldridge Believer and Gov. Jerry Zen (Hash) 
Brownie. One of Marx's unpublished novels is titled "The Individualist." 
</P>
<P>
He knocked on my door in Encinitas on a cold call. In early 1978, when he was 
living in Los Angeles, he went unknowingly to the home of a Times feature 
writer. 
</P>
<P>
The Times did a story ("A Novelist for Whom the Doorbells Toll") and then so 
did the Associated Press, CBS, NBC, National Public Radio and assorted 
newspapers and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he moved to New York. He drove a cab to earn money to publish "Eric 
Greenfield." He sold books to people in his cab and was featured on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he decided to move to San Diego County and, sight unseen, picked 
Cardiff as his destination. 
</P>
<P>
"I just loved the sound of it: Michael Marx, novelist, Cardiff-by-the-Sea," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He has asked Donald Trump, William F. Buckley, H. Ross Perot and Ted Turner for 
help in publishing "The Individualist." No takers, yet. 
</P>
<P>
He is divorced and lives frugally with his 2-year-old Samoyed named Gus. Marx 
reads Nietzsche. He says he makes enough money to pay his rent. 
</P>
<P>
His novels sell for $13.95 each, $25 a pair. He says that's a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"How often can you a buy a signed first-edition from a novelist who comes to 
your door?" 
</P>
<P>
On Top of Things 
</P>
<P>
It says here. 
</P>
<P>
* Working in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
When prisoners on the 6th floor of the county building in El Cajon stop up the 
toilets, it sprinkles in the 5th floor offices of the Probation Department. 
Happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
County building inspectors say it can't be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
* Contractions are the latest in San Diego surfer lingo. 
</P>
<P>
As in, "That wave is to-nar." Totally gnarly. And, "Man was that a cho-nus 
ride." Choice &amp; bonus. 
</P>
<P>
There's more but it's off-color. 
</P>
<P>
* The Post Office delivered an envelope to San Diego City Hall for "Ms. Dianne 
Feinstein, Mayor's Office, San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Inside was a letter addressed to Atty. Gen. John Van De Kamp blasting him for 
favoring the abortion pill RU486. Sent from Pasadena's Committee for Christian 
Action. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
* Ads for the May 20 benefit run/walk for the San Diego Council on Literacy ask 
if anyone is interested in becoming a "literarcy volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
Putting the Lid on a Bargain 
</P>
<P>
It didn't rank with the art theft of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But the recent heist of outdoor decorations at a senior-citizens' apartment 
building in Alpine left residents plenty miffed. 
</P>
<P>
And demanding maximum prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Swiped were: two ceramic deers, four ceramic ducks, a wooden goose, a clay pot 
that looks like an owl, a ceramic sea gull, a welcome sign, a wooden mobile, a 
watering can, wind chimes, a miniature house and assorted plaques. 
</P>
<P>
The stuff has now been found: In a car driven by 28-year-old San Diego man. 
</P>
<P>
He was stopped in "downtown" Alpine about 2 a.m. and arrested for possession of 
methamphetamine. The lawn loot was spotted and six petty theft charges are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's detectives say the stuff was bound for swap meets in San Diego, where 
bargain-hunters are always looking for a good pink flamingo, no questions 
asked.

VERDICT IS IN: COURTROOMS FULL; 
</P>
<P>
OVERCROWDING: THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE IS FLOODED WITH CASES. A LUNCHROOM AND 
COLLEGE CLASSROOMS ARE BEING USED FOR THE SPILLOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Judges, clerks and administrators agree: The Ventura County Courthouse is 
bursting at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, for the first time since the county Hall of Justice was built 
in 1978, a judge will be forced to hear a trial outside of the Courthouse -- in 
a Ventura College of Law classroom. 
</P>
<P>
It is an extraordinary measure forced on the courts by an increasingly routine 
problem. Nearly every day, all 29 courtrooms are full. 
</P>
<P>
"This Courthouse was designed to serve the county to the year 2000, although it 
didn't make it," said Judge Ed Osborne, presiding judge of county Superior 
Court. "We're bursting at the seams for space. We simply don't have the space." 
</P>
<P>
Now, court is held regularly in conference rooms, lunchrooms, jury rooms and 
the law library. 
</P>
<P>
The Municipal and Superior courts' records office is so overloaded that 
microfilming is 16 years behind schedule. Most of the 26.5 million pages of 
unfilmed court papers are being stored at Camarillo Airport because there is 
not room enough in the records office. 
</P>
<P>
And the court clerk's staff soon will be squeezed out of their big 
old-fashioned wooden desks to save space. Some will move into cramped but 
space-efficient modern cubicles, and others into courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We constantly are struggling with space problems here," said Sheila Gonzalez, 
executive officer and clerk of the Superior and Municipal courts. "The 
resources haven't been available to keep up with the growing pains." 
</P>
<P>
The increasing burden of criminal and civil cases is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's population has increased from 529,174 to about 669,000 since 
1980. The amount of civil and criminal litigation has grown, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Court handled 201,067 cases last year, up from 165,000 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
And last year, the Superior Court handled 24,188 active cases, up from only 
14,763 cases filed in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Now the courts employ an average of three retired judges per week, paying them 
each $300 a day to hear cases that sitting judges do not have time for. 
</P>
<P>
As manager of court services for case and calender management, Alice Lopez 
spends her mornings juggling courtrooms and judges. "On Mondays we are filled 
to the gills with settlement conferences being heard by retired judges," Lopez 
said recently. "In Municipal Court, we've tried to juggle and combine schedules 
so if a judge is on vacation or attending a seminar or training we can use his 
courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Robert L. Shaw, who retired from the Superior Court in 1986, returns to 
the bench on a regular basis to help the Superior Court with its backlogged 
caseload. Now 70, Shaw routinely gets what Alice Lopez calls "the short end of 
the stick" -- assignment to temporary courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem I have is carrying a robe around from place to place and 
putting a robe on in front of the whole gathering," Shaw said recently. "It 
feels awkward to stand up in front of 15 to 20 people to change clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said he began his day last Monday in the judges' lunch room, holding a 
juvenile sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Then he walked down the hall to a judges' conference room, "because it's a 
larger room," to handle the day's master calendar work. The agenda: to rule on 
three appeals of Small Claims Court judgments, review two juvenile civil cases 
and try one lawsuit filed by a large water company accusing a smaller water 
company of stealing its water. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I don't know from day to day where I'll be, all parties report in the 
morning to Department 22 and Alice Lopez looks all over the place to find 
something," Shaw said. "If it's a courtroom, it's a courtroom. If it's a 
conference room, it's a conference room. If it's a lunch room, it's a lunch 
room." 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Shaw will be presiding over a civil trial at the Ventura College 
of Law in one of four classrooms which court administrators rent for $75 per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Everything and everyone needed for the trial, which is expected to last 10 to 
15 days, must be shuttled from the Courthouse to the college -- the judge, the 
jurors, law clerks, records and evidence, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Holding court outside a courtroom "is simply not the best way to do things," 
said Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr., presiding judge of the Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of practicing justice, it doesn't matter where I try a case," Cooper 
said. But courts "must be operated with some degree of solemnity and dignity. 
When people go to court it ought to be a fairly important event in their life." 
</P>
<P>
In the Municipal Court's satellite branch in Simi Valley, people are barely in 
court long enough for the experience to make an impression, said Commissioner 
John Paventi. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst day I've ever had was two Wednesdays ago," he said with a groan. "I 
had 169 arraignments and seven court trials in the morning. . . . That's in 
about two hours and 40 minutes. I was able to dispose of them, but you have to 
get quite concerned that people understand what's happening to them when you're 
only speaking to them for 20 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Paventi said that when he moved into the county 17 years ago to practice law, 
the Simi circuit court judge had only two hours work per week. 
</P>
<P>
Now 1,800 to 2,000 cases are filed each month, and the court operates three 
days a week, often in standing-room-only conditions, Paventi said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Simi court will be moved to a new building in Simi Valley, 
with two courtrooms each for Municipal and Superior courts, and one for 
juvenile cases. The calendar may expand to four or five days a week, Paventi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Courthouse staff, meanwhile, now numbers about 270, and is being 
squeezed from every direction. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen Municipal Court clerks are giving up their desks in the second-floor 
clerk's office and moving to permanent desks in the courtrooms where they 
already spend most of their time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got so many people," said Florence Prushan, assistant executive officer 
of both courts. "Our records people used to have desks. We've had to move them 
out. We've had to move workstations into outer office areas because we have 
files in those rooms." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is just bulging at the seams," Prushan said. "When we opened we had 
room for everybody in this building and now it's just a mad scramble for space 
all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gonzalez, Cooper, Osborne and other county court and government 
officials are weighing the options, trying to decide whether to build more 
courtrooms, or to keep using any extra room they can find to handle the 
increasing caseload. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth is constant," said Gonzalez. "There's so much more litigation than 
everybody imagined years and years ago," when the Courthouse was designed. "And 
everybody's filing suits. It's still a growing county."

UNION-TRIBUNE GUILD OKS PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the San Diego Newspaper Guild on Sunday ended a bitter labor dispute 
with the Union-Tribune Publishing Co., voting begrudgingly to accept a new, 
two-year contract but saying all is not well at San Diego's two largest 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Guild members voted 227 to 78 to accept the new labor package that calls, among 
other things, for an immediate 10% pay raise -- the first pay increase for many 
employees since December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The contract negotiated by the guild covers 1,100 employees in the editorial, 
advertising, circulation and business departments. 
</P>
<P>
Guild President Ed Jahn said members felt resigned to accept the new contract 
because it was the best they could expect to muster from the company. "There 
were no shouts of joy," he said of the ratification. "People generally felt it 
was a poor, pitiful, unworthy kind of contract. They were hoping for something 
much better, but they realized the grim reality of the fight -- that the 
publisher had the lawyers and the money." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute at one point boiled to the brink of a strike, which was authorized 
but never called. Instead, many reporters showed their dissatisfaction with the 
company by withholding their bylines and credit lines, and the guild campaigned 
for readers and advertisers to drop their support of the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Jahn criticized publisher Helen Copley for putting the mechanics of publishing 
daily newspapers ahead of good morale in the workplace. "After two years of 
treating people the way she has, she better not expect us to come waltzing to 
work whistling, 'Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go.' The company got 
everything and more than it needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, we made a poor assumption the company would deal fairly with 
us. We've learned from that that we'll have to get meaner a lot quicker with 
Copley next time." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Klein, editor in chief of Copley Newspapers, which publishes the 
morning Union and the afternoon Tribune, said management was "pleased" by the 
ratification, calling the contract a "fair, workable agreement." 
</P>
<P>
"As a company, we are anxious to put aside the strife of the immediate past and 
to move forward to rebuild the professional pride we have in the newspapers," 
Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the labor dispute "went longer than it should have. We'd like now to 
build new labor harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Guild members had argued that the tough contract talks were designed to 
ultimately bust the labor union, and they said Sunday that, given the contract 
terms, the onus was now on guild members to rebuild their organization in order 
to posture for new contract talks in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the guild agreed to a modified union shop in which present 
guild members and future employees would be allowed to choose whether they want 
to belong to the newspaper union or not. The guild also agreed to drop its 
demand for automatic dues deduction -- a term that existed in the previous 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Jahn said the guild would now try to show its value to employees by focusing on 
"creating a labor consciousness in the work force," by considering such 
programs as child care and scholarship programs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the guild succeeded in at least winning a two-year contract; the 
company has pushed for a one-year pact until a state labor mediator intervened 
in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the immediate -- but not retroactive -- 10% pay increase, 
amounting to $75 a week for reporters and other employees currently receiving 
the top minimum pay -- employees covered by the contract would receive a 3% pay 
increase the following year.

Jerry Gladden believes that when it comes to government, smaller is more 
effective than larger. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think that bigger government is better government, but I don't 
believe that's so," said Gladden, of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park 
District, who has been recognized for contributions to his group. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Special Districts Assn., representing a group of 
independent, nonprofit, largely grass-roots and self-governing organizations, 
honored Gladden and three others recently. 
</P>
<P>
Gladden said he is proud that his district puts virtually all its resources 
into its operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Every dollar we get goes straight back into the park because there's no place 
else we can put it," Gladden said. He said local districts that carry out a 
single function are "more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
Others honored were James Meredith, association president; Mark Jacobsen, 
association board member, and state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
Independent special districts are usually formed by area residents to provide 
local services, such as resource conservation, mosquito abatement, drainage and 
health care. The association's purpose is to improve the organization of and 
communication among the 33 special districts of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Two other districts were also honored: the Channel Islands Beach Community 
Services District for its curbside recycling program at Hollywood Beach, Silver 
Strand and Hollywood-by-the-Sea, and the Oxnard Harbor District for its 50 
years of public service to the county. MAJA RADEVICH

COUNCIL RACE, $47-MILLION BOND MEASURE TOP LANCASTER BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: GROWTH AND CRIME ARE KEY ISSUES AS ONE INCUMBENT AND 15 OTHER 
CANDIDATES VIE FOR THREE CITY COUNCIL SEATS IN THE APRIL 10 VOTE.

The crowded campaign for three Lancaster City Council seats enters the final 
stretch this week, with candidates focusing on management of the city's rapid 
growth, reduction of conflict on the City Council and the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by two incumbents -- Mayor Lynn Harrison and Councilman Els Groves 
-- not to seek reelection left a wide-open race for two of the three council 
seats on the April 10 ballot, while incumbent Arnie Rodio is campaigning for 
reelection to the third seat, which he has held since 1986. There are 16 
candidates for the seats, many of whom are well-known in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Many candidates concur on how to address the basic challenges confronting 
Lancaster, a city whose population jumped by nearly 10,000 to an estimated 
90,000 residents in the last year alone. They call for the creation of more 
jobs to reduce the number of residents who must commute to jobs "down below," 
the term residents use to describe areas of Los Angeles County south of the 
Antelope Valley. An estimated 40,000 area residents are commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Crime, particularly gang and drug activity, has been an increasingly 
high-profile issue in the Antelope Valley as urbanization alarms residents who 
once considered the city an exurban refuge, and anti-crime measures have been a 
familiar refrain among the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to conflict on the streets, conflict in the City Council chambers 
has been a campaign topic. There have been occasional bitter political and 
personal confrontations among council members, and candidates have called for 
an end to the acrimony. 
</P>
<P>
Although many candidates say the Antelope Valley's population and construction 
boom has strained roads, the water supply, schools and other infrastructure, 
only a few describe themselves as favoring slow growth. Instead, the majority 
stress the importance of managing growth. 
</P>
<P>
Among the latter is Jack Abney, 63, who wants to retain a "country atmosphere" 
in Lancaster. Abney works as a property manager for a real estate firm. He has 
stressed the importance of protecting Edwards Air Force Base and Air Force 
Plant 42, two of the region's biggest employers, from urban encroachment. He 
also called for a program to attract clean industry to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Bateman, 42, is another advocate of "planned growth." She runs a 
financial planning business and calls for council members to stop fighting. 
Reducing the commuter population will have a positive impact on youth-related 
problems such as gangs, Bateman said, because parents will be closer to their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Carl (Duke) Bloom, 59, said that Lancaster is "the last frontier" for young 
home buyers, and that new development will bring schools and parks paid for by 
developers. Bloom, who owns an appliance store, said he wants to preserve the 
competitiveness of small businesses as big commercial centers proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Henry (Hank) Hearns, 56, was chief environmental engineer at Edwards 
Air Force Base until his retirement in December. He serves as pastor of the 
First Missionary Baptist Church in Littlerock. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Hughes, an insurance agent, said she wants the city to televise City 
Council meetings on local cable channels to increase awareness of government 
business among residents. She described herself as an advocate of controlled 
growth and said more must be done to combat gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Lacey, 61, said he wants to "save the city of Lancaster from builders, 
real estate dealers and developers who want to overdevelop the city." Lacey, a 
retired aerospace quality-control consultant, also wants to create a city 
police department to replace the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff J. Murray, 21, is a deliveryman for a pizza restaurant and a political 
science student at Cal State Northridge. He said he sees his candidacy as the 
start of a political career. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Peeler, 56, a retired landlord, wants to curtail the spread of high-density 
housing in Lancaster. He opposes recent development near Plant 42, which was 
also opposed by Air Force officials, who said the proximity of the housing 
would lead to conflicts over aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
Professional tennis umpire Claude (Rocky) Pickering, 63, says he will use his 
experience as a professional labor arbitrator to end conflict on the City 
Council. He also believes that council members should not double as members of 
the Redevelopment Agency and pledges to appoint a representative to that agency 
in his place. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Roberts, 58, is dean of technical education at Antelope Valley College 
and serves on local committees working to bring a state university to the area 
and to block a planned state prison in Lancaster. He believes that a spectrum 
of community groups should be involved in preparation of the city's General 
Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Rodio, 61, is a plumbing contractor and has been on the council longer than the 
either of the other council members. He urged voters to retain him because of 
that experience. He also said the council has done a good job, saying, "If you 
slow down development, you are putting your head in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
George Root, 59, an administrator for an Edwards Air Force Base research 
facility, is a leader of mobile home residents. He calls for new schools, 
improved streets and "planned growth" that would involve strict adherence to 
the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Singer, 36, a Los Angeles County Fire Department captain, made news 
when he was forced off the ballot over a residency dispute, but has since 
qualified as a Lancaster resident and started a write-in campaign. He said he 
speaks for residents concerned that development will destroy their quality of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
June Snow, a 43-year-old hospital administrator, said development is slowing 
down on its own and that the council must better plan all the facets of the 
community affected by growth, including recreation and education. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Steese, 74, is a retired engineer. He espouses a hard-line anti-crime 
stance, calling for an auxiliary police force and for treating drug dealing to 
minors as "premeditated attempted murder." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony E. Tsaousis, 46, manages an architectural firm. He says one of his 
priorities is ensuring that the high desert has a viable water supply. He calls 
for new water conservation measures.

RESOURCES: SOME WANT TO USE THE CHANNEL TO RELIEVE FREEWAY CONGESTION. OTHERS 
LOBBY FOR THE CREATION OF A RECREATIONAL MECCA FOR CITY DWELLERS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) looks at the Los Angeles River he 
envisions car pool and truck lanes to relieve freeway congestion from the San 
Fernando Valley to San Pedro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
When Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) sees the river, he dreams of turning the 
concrete-lined flood control channel into an oasis of open space, especially 
for inner-city residents craving parks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which maintains part of the flood 
control channel, is studying a proposal to spend approximately $250 million to 
raise the river's levees, now between 20 and 25 feet high, by several feet. 
</P>
<P>
These differing views of the paved channel are at the center of a tug of war, 
which last week shifted to the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, Torres painted a 
picture of the river as a mecca for joggers, hikers, picnickers, and horseback 
riders. "The Los Angeles River really has an opportunity to come to life 
again," the Los Angeles Democrat told the committee. "Those of us who were born 
and raised in L.A. have an affinity for it. . . . Many of us used that river as 
an escape from city life." 
</P>
<P>
For Torres, the drive to establish a river park is part of a fight to turn Los 
Angeles into a more livable city, especially in areas he represents, downtown 
and on the Eastside. Instead of building a roadway down the middle of the 
channel, Torres declared: "Let us turn back the clock and have a real river 
again." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief hearing, the committee, on a 7-0 vote, approved his bill to 
earmark $200,000 for the Coastal Conservancy to prepare a master plan to 
develop the river over the next two decades into a park and recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has proposed establishing a citizens advisory 
committee to consider doing essentially the same thing. Bradley, who has not 
offered many details of how he would revitalize the river, sent a letter to 
Torres in January calling the river one of the city's "greatest land assets." 
The river, he said in the letter, creates an opportunity for open space, 
recreation and other development. 
</P>
<P>
This is only the most recent vision for the river. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, who is chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, proposed that 
the river from Tujunga Wash in the East Valley to downtown Los Angeles be 
reserved for buses, vans and car-poolers. Another stretch of the river from 
downtown south to Long Beach would be for trucks hauling cargo from the ports 
of Long Beach and Los Angeles to rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
At his urging, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission set aside 
$100,000 to study the roadway concept. The study, to be finished in August, 
will look at the kind of transportation that should run along the river bottom, 
ways to protect people from floods and how to provide access to the channel. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers, which paved the river, has been studying a 
proposal to raise the height of the channel, primarily between Compton and Long 
Beach, to help reduce the threat of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-mile waterway begins in the southwest Valley, where Bell and Calabasas 
creeks come together. It flows east along the northern base of the Santa Monica 
Mountains, runs through the narrows at Glendale, past downtown Los Angeles and 
through the industrial towns of Vernon, Bell, South Gate and Compton, finally 
flowing into San Pedro Bay in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About 35 miles of the waterway are paved. Only about five miles of natural 
riverbed exist, in the Sepulveda Basin, near Griffith Park, and near Willow 
Street in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers began paving the riverbed after a string of fatal storms 
in 1938. During World War II, military equipment was hauled along the channel 
to the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of using the river as a roadway resurfaced almost 35 years later. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the state Department of Transportation began studying whether to turn 
an 18-mile stretch extending from Willow Street in Long Beach to north of 
downtown Los Angeles into a roadway. But Robert Goodell, a state transportation 
planner, said "nothing ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later -- after the Arab oil embargo highlighted the need to reduce 
automobile trips -- the state examined building a bus way down the river 
bottom. Apparently no one thought the idea was worth pursuing, Goodell said. 
</P>
<P>
But Katz dusted off the suggestion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Before last Tuesday's hearing on the Torres bill, Katz sent a memo to 
legislators alerting them to his vision of the river. He asserted that his view 
of the river and Torres' are not incompatible, and that he envisions 
"greenbelts" along his proposed motor way. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said architects are developing a plan that would integrate the roadway 
with parks, businesses and housing along the river banks. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the river channel has been ignored, left to perform its primary 
function, flood protection for millions of people," Katz said in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the problems that confront us and the potential of the river channel, we 
ought to look at all the options, not just a parkway," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Katz questioned the use of scarce water resources to maintain 
Torres' proposed parkway and expressed concern about exposing people to the 
water, some of which has been treated in sewage plants. "The idea of people 
recreating in the sewage in the Los Angeles River is ludicrous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres dismissed the criticism, saying that roadways like those proposed by 
Katz "will be passe in the future as we provide for more light rail" and that 
his legislation is "a pro-river bill and a pro-environment bill." Moreover, 
Torres questioned whether motorists driving down the Los Angeles River would 
have enough time to leave the highway in the event of a flash flood. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, county and federal authorities say that in all of the talk about the 
future of the river, it is sometimes forgotten that the channel is designed to 
reduce floods. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Sweeten, a Corps of Engineers planner, said, "most people don't perceive a 
flood threat," especially now, because of the water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have said that the higher levees and modifications to highway 
bridges also sought by the Corps of Engineers would stop a 100-year flood that 
is expected to inundate most of Long Beach and all or part of 15 other 
Southeast and South Bay cities. The proposal is part of a federal program 
designed to eventually contain the river within its banks, even after 
torrential rains, and provide flood insurance for property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Young, the Corps' water resources branch chief in Los Angeles, said he does 
not believe the higher levees would affect a parkway or a highway in the 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the Corps' overriding priority is to ensure that flood 
control is not undermined by any changes to the river channel. "If you go into 
the river and do anything to significantly impact the flood-carrying capability 
of the river, we would clearly have a problem with that," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeten pointed out that the Corps of Engineers and the Los Angeles County 
Department of Public Works, which maintains other portions of the river, must 
give the green light to any changes in the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they have not made up their minds about the future of the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the flood control function is not impaired, then we're willing to 
be open minded," said Jean Granucci, head of public affairs with the Department 
of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
But she cautioned that with either the roadway or the park proposal "there are 
some serious technical problems that have to be overcome." She cited the 
problem of access to the river if it is allowed to return to its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Carrell, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said she, too, has an open mind 
and would like both the roadway and parkland options studied. She expressed 
personal doubts about the Katz proposal, saying "Los Angeles is clearly starved 
for parks." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that a parkway could become a way to connect rich and poor 
communities in the Los Angeles area. She described plants and trees which 
already grow in the river as bits of green in "otherwise paved-over 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSALS FOR THE LOS ANGELES RIVER 
</P>
<P>

OLVERA STREET: MEXICANS WERE HERE LONG BEFORE THE GRINGO. A MULTI-ETHNIC MUSEUM 
WOULD TRAMPLE THAT HERITAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
News that a small group of preservationists seeks to transform Olvera Street 
from a Mexican marketplace into a multi-ethnic museum should outrage Latinos. 
After all, the plaza area has been inhabited by Mexicans since 1781, when a 
dozen or so peasants, mostly from the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora, 
founded the Pueblo of Los Angeles. Spending time on Olvera Street is thus a 
trip through tradition. 
</P>
<P>
From 1900-1930, bulldozers virtually cleared the civic center of all else that 
was Mexican, mostly family homes. Then, Christine Sterling and members of the 
city's social and economic elite moved, in the late '20s, to save and preserve 
Olvera as a symbol of Los Angeles' Mexican heritage. The street was little more 
than an alley. Like the Avila adobe, which had been condemned, its days were 
numbered. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Olvera was part of California's "Fantasy Heritage" -- a tourist trap. 
But over the years, its people reintegrated it with the plaza and Our Lady 
Queen of the Angels, the city's oldest church. Mexicans and other Latinos began 
returning to Los Angeles' Bethlehem. Today, Olvera Street is where many of us 
go to celebrate our holidays or to enjoy the oldest remnant of the Mexican 
heritage in the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, a tradition worth preserving. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Jeane Poole, curator of El Pueblo Historic Park, has embraced Olvera Street's 
dilapidated buildings -- mostly stucco and red brick -- rather than its 
traditions and people. It's no secret that she believes the Mexican presence on 
Olvera Street so overwhelming that the contributions of the Chinese, the 
Italians and other neighborhood ethnic groups to the city's development have 
been eclipsed. To dilute the Mexican presence, she has advocated that 
restoration of Olvera Street spotlight the architecture of its buildings. 
Toward this end, she has enlisted the support of architectural historians. 
</P>
<P>
For 12 years, Poole and her gaggle of Anglo historians have been plotting to 
impose their Mexican-less vision of Olvera Street. Their opportunity for 
success came when administration of El Pueblo Park passed from state to the 
city Recreation and Parks Commission. Eager to renovate, the commissioners put 
together a proposal. Since they and the Recreation and Parks Dept. lack the 
expertise to make historical recommendations, Peter Snell, an architectural 
historian, was paid to make some. Snell is a close friend of Poole and has 
acted as a consultant for El Pueblo Park. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's proposal calls for Olvera Street to be renovated and its 
history interpreted in conformity with the architecture of the "Prime Historic 
Period" of 1920-1932. Why 1920-1932? Why not 1880-1910? For one thing, the 
latter would involve tearing down what constitutes today's Chinatown to make 
way for reconstruction of Sonora Town. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, historians will tell you that "Prime Historic Periods" are 
convenient covers for diluting the influence of unwanted groups. In the case of 
Olvera Street: No Mexicans Wanted. 
</P>
<P>
What the commissioners and the building-oriented historians are forgetting is 
that, like it or not, if it had not been for the Mexican marketplace, there 
would be no preservation debate, since there would be no buildings to preserve. 
Before Mexican merchants moved in, many of Poole's "Prime Historic" buildings 
were slated for demolition -- the preferred people-remover technique in the 
'30s. But when the alley became a thriving marketplace, those dilapidated 
stucco and red-brick buildings that Poole now waxes poetic over were saved. 
</P>
<P>
History is made by people, not by buildings. The Latino hegemony in the plaza 
area is a reminder that Mexicans, here long before the Gringo, are not aliens. 
Put a plaque on those buildings to indicate that they are proud examples of the 
Poole's "Prime Historic Period." As for Olvera Street, the plaza area and its 
people, they are too alive to be turned into a musty museum built by Poole and 
Associates.

COOPERATE TO POINT OUR LEARNING CURVE UPWARD; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: IF OUR PUBLIC SYSTEM IS GOING TO RESPOND TO AMERICA'S NEEDS, 
EDUCATORS AND EXECUTIVES MUST GET TOGETHER AND FIND COMMON GROUND. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
America is facing a severe labor shortage throughout the 1990s. Our population 
is increasing at a rate slower than in any era since the Great Depression. 
We're also getting older. 
</P>
<P>
While we will have fewer workers to draw on, we will be making more demands on 
them. They'll have to exercise more creativity and initiative than ever before. 
And they'll have to learn to work harder and smarter. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario suggests that corporate chief executive officers and school 
superintendents should rethink the way we prepare ourselves and our people for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to improving the quality of America's public school system, 
executives and educators face many of the same issues and have many of the same 
goals. Yet even though we both have an enormous stake in the success of our 
schools, we still approach education reform from different directions and 
envision solutions largely from our own perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
That observation was reinforced by the results of surveys of executives and 
school administrators that my company conducted in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Educators told us that the public education system is doing a pretty good job. 
They graded it a B-minus. Executives said the performance is only fair and 
marked it a C-minus. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of past and future trends, about 75% of the educators said our public 
schools are better today than they were 10 years ago. About the same percentage 
expected the schools to improve throughout the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Yet almost two-thirds of the executives said that public education became worse 
during the '80s. Less than half predicted any real improvement by the end of 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Educators and executives did agree on what's causing the problem -- factors 
such as lack of parental involvement and poorly motivated students. But there 
were significant differences, too. Educators, for instance, were more than 
twice as likely to place part of the blame on budget cuts. Executives, twice as 
often as did educators, cited inadequately trained teachers, low academic 
standards and lack of emphasis on basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about turning our schools around, both agreed on several key points 
-- getting parents more involved, making teachers more accountable and doing a 
better job of motivating students. 
</P>
<P>
However, the executives were more likely than educators to propose bigger 
salaries and smaller classes for teachers. Executives were three times more 
supportive of parents' right to choose their children's schools. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what companies should do to help schools, educators suggested 
supporting tax increases and contributing materials and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Executives said they also favored those kinds of support activities. But they 
were likely to mention donations of money, manpower -- in the form of employee 
lectures and tutors -- and giving part-time jobs to students. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 25% of the executives and educators said that companies were having 
a real impact on the schools in their area. More than half said they haven't 
made a difference at all. 
</P>
<P>
If that's true, it probably reflects the fact that business and education have 
focused on joint efforts for only a relatively short time. It may also mean 
that executives and educators often still see the world in different ways. And 
it's hampering our efforts to get America's learning curve pointed in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
To fix this problem, it seems to me that we need to rub out the line between 
us, draw a big circle and invite everyone in. The best way to do all that is to 
tackle the issue where it matters most -- at the local level, where we can be 
most productive. 
</P>
<P>
When people of good will come together, powerful things happen. Talk to those 
already involved in business/education partnerships and you'll find that 
parents, teachers, executives, administrators, government officials and civic 
leaders quickly see that each has substance to offer the others. 
</P>
<P>
With a partnership, it's possible to create a common agenda and a shared vision 
that brings success. The revolution begins with one school, one district, one 
town at a time. Everyone plays a part. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a need to support this kind of consensus at the state and 
national level. 
</P>
<P>
I'm proposing a kind of continuing education program for educators, executives 
and everyone else interested in our schools. With an ongoing dialogue, we can 
share insights and suggestions, learn more about each other's proposals, clear 
the air and take a fresh look at our options. 
</P>
<P>
Let's agree to do what's necessary today so that a generation from now, history 
can say we gave the children of America the education they deserved.

ROSTENKOWSKI'S DEFICIT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your editorial ("No Reason to Laugh at Rosty's Plan," March 13) 
and your kind remarks about my deficit reduction plan. Can I have another one 
soon? 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to sound greedy or ungracious and I do appreciate your help. 
Rather I want to focus on the continued need for discipline within our 
political system. Many of my colleagues, like many of our constituents, have a 
very short attention span. Similarly, like other Americans, they have a 
distaste for tough decisions and try to defer them. Those attitudes explain 
much of today's budget mess. 
</P>
<P>
What we need now is a continuing message that stresses the need to meet this 
challenge. There must be clear evidence that the public -- and the press -- 
will continue to focus on this issue until action is taken. Once there is a 
realization that this question must be resolved, we will have the strength to 
take action. 
</P>
<P>
I do not mean this as a criticism of my colleagues or our constituents. The 
combination of a short-term focus and a deferral of tough decisions is one that 
has many negative ramifications for our entire economy. The paralysis of our 
political system is just one of them. 
</P>
<P>
What we need now is timely and honest debate about the plan I have put forth. 
Our agreement that strong action is required is stronger than any disagreement 
we may have about the specifics. Only when there is an agreement that we will 
move forward can the debate about the specifics begin. 
</P>
<P>
You have helped begin the process and thereby performed a public service. I 
hope you can help to finish it. Thanks for your assistance -- both now and in 
future weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were killed when their vehicle struck another vehicle and rammed a tree 
on California 76, just east of Nate Harrison Grade Road, 
</P>
<P>
The crash occured at 8:45 p.m. Saturday and killed the driver, Juan Lopez Rizo, 
24, and his passenger, Rodolfo Saldana, who was in his 20s, said Deputy Coroner 
Cal Vine. Both men were from Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said Rizo's vehicle was westbound on California 
76 and apparently drifted into the eastbound lane, where it collided with a car 
driven by Felipe Carrillo, also of Temecula. Rizo's vehicle then crossed back 
over the highway, went off the side and hit a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo was taken to Palomar Medical Center in Escondido with moderate 
injuries.

REDISTRIBUTING FOREIGN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. foreign aid is stingy? Nonsense! Over the past few decades, America gave 
Israel more than $45 billion in foreign aid. No benefits were realized by the 
U.S. For the past 2 years, U.S. aid funded the human rights violations 
perpetrated by Israelis against Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The largest recipients of foreign aid receive the aid year after year. What 
plans do those nations have to become independent of U.S. aid? Reallocating aid 
now will: 
</P>
<P>
Help the emerging democracies; jolt the largest recipients into the realization 
that U.S. foreign aid is not an entitlement program, and provide the President 
with the flexibility and authority to effectively allocate aid funds. 
</P>
<P>
Under-funding is not the problem. The problem is ineffective distribution of 
foreign aid by Congress.

Eleven teen-agers riding in a pickup truck were thrown from it -- but none 
received major injuries -- at Interstate 8 at Lake Jennings Park Road, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was heading westbound at 1 a.m. Sunday when the driver, John Batts, 
19, of El Cajon, leaned over his shoulder to tell the passengers riding in the 
bed of the pickup to quiet down, the CHP said. The vehicle hit the asphalt curb 
alongside the freeway and overturned down an embankment. 
</P>

Several of the teen-agers, including Batts, were taken to Grossmont Hospital, 
where officials said they were treated for minor injuries and released.

OVERCROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After six years of going slowly insane on Southern California freeways, I 
recently took a 20% cut in pay for the opportunity to walk to work every 
morning. During the same morning hours when I used to gnash my teeth, breathe 
carbon monoxide, and be appalled at the inconsiderate driving habits of 
pinheads in mini-trucks, I now read the paper over a leisurely cup of coffee, 
go for a bike ride and listen to the birds sing. 
</P>
<P>
I hold no illusions that my decision will have any impact on the commuter 
situation in general simply because the greed-head developers and the elected 
officials that they have bought and paid for will continue to throw up 
clone-home "neighborhoods" as quickly as people move here to fill them up. 
</P>
<P>
I know that this part of the country will never again be the beautiful, clean 
place that it was when I was growing up, but perhaps the aggravation and stress 
that I am avoiding with my job change will help delay my inevitable emigration 
for a few more years. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. If you love California, let your water run over the curb and into the 
gutter -- drought is the only force that can stop development!

A 'DEAL' TO GIVE AWAY THE STORE; 
</P>
<P>
MEXICO: A FREE-TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. WOULD BE A TRAVESTY OF HISTORY AND 
ECONOMICS. EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT IS AN ACT OF POLITICAL DESPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a graduate professor of political 
science at the National University of Mexico. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaks in Washington and rumors in Mexico about the beginning of talks on a 
free-trade agreement are both surprising and expected. 
</P>
<P>
The move toward a common market is surprising because Mexico has always 
questioned whether full economic integration with the United States would 
benefit Mexico; the present administration has constantly restated Mexico's 
position that across-the-board free trade was not in our best interest. Just 
two weeks ago, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, speaking in Chile, stressed 
the need for Mexico to strengthen its ties to Latin America, rejecting the 
notion of joining any one trading bloc. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a surprise, to say the least, to learn that at the same time, 
Salinas' top aides were secretly meeting in Washington with the secretaries of 
State and Commerce, James A. Baker III and Robert A. Mosbacher, and Trade 
Representative Carla A. Hills, along with National Security Council Director 
Brent Scowcroft. The subject: possible negotiations on fully open trade between 
the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, these developments cannot be considered entirely unexpected. 
For months, many careful observers of the Mexican economy have been warning 
that, under existing conditions, and despite its apparent, superficial success, 
Salinas' economic reform program faced nearly insurmountable obstacles. Herein 
lies the explanation for the Mexican move toward an agreement with Washington, 
as well as its accelerated pace and secrecy. Herein also lie the reasons for 
doubting the wisdom of this bold -- or reckless -- step. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is relatively simple. The initial drastic trade opening abruptly 
imposed on Mexico two years ago has had foreseeable consequences. Even with a 
barely growing economy, but thanks to a politically indispensable appreciating 
exchange rate, imports have skyrocketed and exports have stagnated. Purchases 
abroad rose 57% in 1988, nearly 30% in 1989, yet the economy grew only at an 
average of 1.5% per year, and investment in infrastructure, capital goods and 
retooling remained low (even though these are all import-intensive areas). 
Exports grew only 15% in 1989, and half of that growth represented a rise in 
oil prices. Non-oil exports increased only by 8%. During the fourth quarter of 
1989, the annualized figure for the trade deficit was $3.5 billion -- higher 
than at any time since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The meaning of this was evident. If the economy were ever to reach even a 4% 
sustained yearly growth, it would require enormous external funding -- roughly 
$5 billion a year -- for a considerable period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Given the country's foreign debt and the trade opening, for Mexico to grow it 
had to drastically reduce its debt service or obtain money some other way. The 
Salinas-Brady debt package ended up providing only marginal relief -- 
outstanding debt remaining more or less stable, and yearly debt service 
dropping by 15%, at most. 
</P>
<P>
That left only three possibilities for easing the deficit: a recession, which 
in fact happened early this year; or the return of Mexican capital from abroad, 
quickly and in droves; or a rush of direct foreign investment into Mexico. Some 
money has trickled back, but even in small amounts, repatriation of capital 
requires exorbitant domestic real interest rates, and the process does not seem 
likely to become lasting or substantial. 
</P>
<P>
More important, foreign investment is not forthcoming, despite changes in 
regulations and the government's efforts to woo investors. During the first 
nine months of last year, the net flow, according to Mexico's respected 
financial daily, El Financiero, reached only $1.337 billion, down 45% from the 
previous year. Prospects are even less encouraging as European and Japanese 
investment is diverted to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the immediate problems, analysts of the Mexican economy see a broader 
obstacle to a significant rise in direct foreign investment. In the past, 
investors were attracted by Mexico's growing, protected internal market. But 
since 1982 the domestic market in Mexico has been stagnant or shrinking, and 
since 1987 it has been totally unprotected. U.S. investment will flow to the 
Mexican export sector -- which is directed essentially at the U.S. market -- or 
not at all. But export investment requires guaranteed product access to export 
markets as well as full, unrestricted, across-the-board investor access to the 
host-country banks, insurance companies, communications, consultants and so on. 
This is where the free-trade agreement comes into play. 
</P>
<P>
If Mexico is to receive the amount of foreign investment that the Salinas 
program requires, a full-fledged open trade agreement with the United States 
seems to be a necessary condition. It is also an urgent one: Salinas faces 
congressional elections next year and a presidential election in 1994. If 
things do not come together quickly on the economic front, his entire 
presidency may unravel. But the solution -- economic integration with the 
United States -- may prove more costly and more dangerous than the problem. 
This explains the secrecy and the government's waffling on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an easy issue to deal with. Mexicans' fears and doubts about a common 
market are not groundless. While parts of the country and society would benefit 
-- the north, and the upper-middle class -- others could be permanently 
condemned to the humiliation of the underpaid, under-skilled underclass. 
Political autonomy might be sacrificed for prosperity for certain regions and 
sectors but not for the whole country. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican nationalism would not easily acquiesce to this state of affairs. And 
tying the Mexican economy's future to that of the U.S. economy at a time of 
great uncertainty is not necessarily the most prudent course to follow. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Latin American economic integration seems illusory, and 
Mexico's economic links to the north are already extraordinarily tight. Indeed, 
the question of closer economic ties with the United States appears 
increasingly less relevant than that of how to establish them in a way that 
reduces their negative potential and enhances their benefits for Mexico. In 
this case, the issue changes, and Salinas' rush toward integration becomes open 
to criticism for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
If Mexico must consider the prospect of a common market, or even a limited 
free-trade agreement, with the United States and possibly Canada, it should do 
so only under certain conditions. The first one, of course, has to do with 
openness and democracy: Such a major change in the country's history cannot be 
carried out behind the Mexican people's backs, or without their informed and 
democratically expressed consent. Nothing of the sort is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
The process should be undertaken as part of a patient, long-term, 
well-thought-out political and economic strategy. It cannot and will not work 
as a quick fix undertaken for reasons of political survival or expediency. 
Countries that negotiate in a hurry generally give away the store, and Mexico's 
store has been given away far too many times. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mexico should press, and hold out as long as is necessary, for access for 
its main export to the United States, now and in the foreseeable future: 
people. Freedom of entry for Mexican labor is obviously something Washington 
will not accept willingly overnight. 
</P>
<P>
But this is what real negotiations, as opposed to unilateral concessions, are 
all about: accepting the previously unacceptable. Bold strokes and historic 
changes should come about on both sides of the border, in American policy 
toward Mexico and in the Mexican government's policy toward Mexican society. 
Otherwise they are simply desperate shots in the dark, which a proud and worthy 
people will not countenance.

MARINES NEED TO MOVE TUSTIN COPTER FACILITY; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT NEAR THE AIR STATION MAKES ITS OPERATIONS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL BRADY JR., Paul Brady Jr. is the city manager of Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Living next door to the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro and the Tustin 
helicopter base, as the city of Irvine does, creates unique problems. The 
situation challenges the ability of the City Council and me as city manager to 
protect the rights of residents to live peacefully in relatively quiet 
surroundings, and at the same time remain supportive of the national defense 
mission of the Marines, who were here long before the city. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, we have worked hard to build good relations with the Marines. 
We are neighbors, but we have very different interests. MCAS El Toro is a major 
military air base with high performance, and extremely noisy jet fighters. 
Irvine is a rapidly growing and primarily residential community. Normally, 
entities such as these are less than compatible. So differences are going to 
occur, and we must do our best to work them out. 
</P>
<P>
Having a good relationship where we can maintain an open dialogue has helped 
make it possible for Irvine and the Marines to coexist peacefully, respect each 
other's turf and work closely together on issues of conflict. Our ability to do 
that has steadily improved since 1980, when the city and the Marines entered 
into a Memorandum of Understanding that recognized the need for mutual 
cooperation. The memorandum addressed a wide range of issues. Under it, some of 
the things the Marines agreed to included working with the city to mitigate 
adverse impacts of base operations, adhering to takeoff and landing patterns 
that minimize noise impacts on surrounding communities, and keeping the city 
and its residents notified of changes in operating procedure. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, the city agreed to work with the Marines on land planning affecting 
the base, to advise them of proposed new developments and, among other things, 
to waive restrictions in times of national emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of that document, open dialogue has helped lead to the 
extension of Jamboree Road through the base, adjustments in planning that have 
benefited all parties, and the realignment of the "Browning Corridor" used by 
helicopters operating out of MCAS Tustin to minimize residential neighborhood 
overflights. Eighteen months ago, the city also formed the Helicopter 
Overflights Task Force, made up of residents, city staff and Marines. The Task 
Force's findings and recommendations, presented to the City Council Feb. 13, 
addressed a variety of issues, including better public notification of 
helicopter activities and establishment of navigational landmarks to help keep 
pilots away from residential neighborhoods. The cooperative work of the task 
force represents an important step in helping mitigate the noise impacts of 
helicopters operating from MCAS Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing, however, that helicopter overflights still represent a continuing 
disruption, the Marines need to eventually consider relocation of the 
helicopter operations at the MCAS Tustin facility, which has been in operation 
since the 1930s. Development around that site has made it incompatible with the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
In-depth discussions to encourage early relocation have been initiated by the 
city. If the Marines agree to move, they will need to be compensated fairly for 
the base property. Presently, however, they have no plans to relocate -- but we 
hope that they will consider this alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions on relocation will no doubt present major challenges. So, too, will 
the Marines' recent draft study of projected aircraft noise levels. The study, 
known as the Air Installations Compatible Use Zones program, or AICUZ, 
establishes a noise "footprint" within which certain types of development 
cannot occur. Unlike previous AICUZ studies, which have been used for 10 years 
as the basis for the city's land planning, the draft study incorporated a new 
methodology that extended the size of the footprint to include areas previously 
believed to be outside the AICUZ boundary. Consequently, the draft report threw 
years of land planning into doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The city recognizes that the Marines are concerned about continued encroachment 
of development around the base. We want to address these concerns as well. 
However, the sudden use of a new methodology resulting in a larger footprint 
has raised questions in many people's minds. Raising further questions were 
reports that the computer model used to create the footprint ignored actual 
test data that showed noise levels to be less than noise presently being 
experienced on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
We believe it is important to establish criteria for noise projections that 
will stand the test of time and allow the community to plan for the future. But 
we don't want this or any single issue to dampen a largely positive 
relationship. Irvine and the Marines have a solid history of cooperative 
dialogue, and in some cases, a sharing of interest. Neither we nor the Marines, 
for instance, ever want to see full or even joint commercial use of MCAS El 
Toro. We have worked as the closest of allies in protecting this shared 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, we have found a way to coexist peacefully and work together. 
Like two old neighbors, we have our differences, but we each keep coming back 
to borrow a cup of sugar.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;

<P>
STOP GROWTH OF CREEPING PATIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it the case of the creeping, mutant patios. The first were built 40 years 
ago, beginning as two- or three-foot barriers constructed to protect Newport 
Beach homes from high tides and sand. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, barbecues were added. Then other property owners followed suit, 
adding decks, landscaping and even sprinkler systems. A few now jut 27 feet 
onto a public right of way intended for a beach road that was never built. In 
all, 295 illegal patios have been built along three miles of public beaches, 
giving the illusion that the areas involved are privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
The city should never have allowed this to happen. Public beaches are so 
precious and limited that California voters approved the Coastal Act of 1976 to 
preserve and protect them. The Coastal Commission, which can assess hefty 
penalties against beach-property owners who encroach on public lands, has 
finally forced Newport Beach to look at the issue. A panel appointed by the 
city has offered what is at best a modest solution: limiting patios to 15 feet 
and requiring property owners to pay $50 to $200 annually for use of public 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners who are crying foul should consider themselves fortunate that 
they aren't being required to roll back their patios. As Councilwoman Evelyn R. 
Hart said: "You all knew someday you'd have to face the music." But as a 
practical matter, the nonconforming uses have been allowed so long that there 
are too many now to impose massive reconstruction. However, the city should 
inspect each one to make sure it is within the proposed limits. And no more 
patios should be built. It's the very least that can be done to alleviate a 
situation that has gone on too long.

LYNN'S SPRING IMPRESSES PADRES

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to work this way. Really, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' intent in signing Fred Lynn last December as a free-agent 
outfielder was simple, remember? He'd be kept on the bench for depth in the 
outfield, used in late-inning, pinch-hitting situations, and cut loose in the 
clubhouse to spread his veteran leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But employ him as an everyday starter? Uh-uh. Come on, this is a 38-year-old, 
injury-plagued man you're talking about here. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it looks like I'm ruining their plans, doesn't it," said Lynn, allowing 
his face to break into an expansive grin. "I figured they thought I'd come off 
the bench, do some heroic things, and help out some of the younger guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure this isn't what they had in mind." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres broke camp Sunday with a 6-2 record, defeating the Seattle Mariners, 
5-3, and the biggest surprise of their two-week stay in Yuma was none other 
than Frederick Michael Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn, who went two for two Sunday, leads the Padres with a .615 batting 
average. He's eight for 13 this spring with two home runs, three RBIs, a .722 
on-base percentage and a 1.076 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe that guy?" Padre outfielder Joe Carter said. "If he keeps 
hitting the ball like that, it's going to be hard to get him out of the lineup. 
I think he's rejuvenated, if you ask me." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn, who signed as a free agent for a $500,000 base salary, said: "I think 
most of all, I've proven something to myself this spring. You have to have 
confidence, and right now, I feel very good about the way I'm playing." 
</P>
<P>
Although Padre Manager Jack McKeon has a week to change his mind, Lynn 
currently is scheduled to be the Padres' starting left fielder on opening day. 
If he continues anywhere near this pace, it might be awhile before he ever 
comes out. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some good springs before," Lynn said, "but this is as good as I've 
had in a while. Of course, this spring is different. Some springs, I'll be 
trying some crazy things, but this spring, I'm already in my game-day mode." 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing now is not to get hurt. I've got to get out of spring training 
clean. That's why you won't see me taking any chances. I don't want to do 
anything crazy." 
</P>
<P>
It was, after all, in 1977 when Lynn had the finest spring-training of his 
career. It was like he could do no wrong. He was convinced this would a banner 
season, maybe another MVP year. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was going so great for the first 20 games, I was killing the ball," 
Lynn said. "Then I tore all of the ligaments in my ankle. What a crusher. That 
ruined everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to let it happen to me this time." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will open the 1990 season one week from today at Dodger Stadium, but 
the most important date on many of their minds is April 13. 
</P>
<P>
That is the day their former teammate, Dave Leiper, will undergo open heart 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most important thing right now," Padre catcher Mark Parent said. 
"There's a lot of us worried about him in here. You realize there's more 
important things in life than baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Leiper, who spent 2 1/2 seasons with the Padres before being released in 
December, suffered heart palpitations again three weeks ago while working out 
in the Oakland Athletics' mini-camp. He was taken to a Phoenix hospital when it 
was discovered, he said, what was described to him as an extra pathway to his 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to take that out," Leiper said. "They could zap it electrically, but 
the surest thing is to open me up and get it. I'll be out of the hospital in 
five or six days, but it'll take a while for the sternum to heal. 
</P>
<P>
"I could probably get by if I keep taking medication, but later in life, they 
said, something could happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just as soon get it over with now. They said the first available date was 
Friday the 13th, and asked if I minded. I said, 'Nah, I'm not superstitious. 
Just get me in there.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Padres plan a visit to Leiper in the hospital the following day in Redwood 
City, Calif. As fate would have it, they'll be in San Francisco that weekend 
for a three-game series against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Leip we'll all be there," Parent said. "Nothing's going to keep us away 
from seeing him." 
</P>
<P>
Although TV producer Tom Werner of Los Angeles and his nine limited partners 
are in the process of purchasing the Padres for $75 million, Dodger owner Peter 
O'Malley said Sunday that the Padres have submitted numerous prospective buyers 
to baseball's ownership committee over the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
"They've talked to a number of people, and we've gone over a lot of names," 
said O'Malley, a member of the eight-man ownership committee. "A lot of people 
have been considered. I really can't say much more than that, but the 
(screening) process already has begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We first tried to convince her to stay in the game, but we couldn't do it. She 
said it was time to get on with the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"When they're ready, we'll complete our process, and make a recommendation to 
the other owners. It's not likely the league would go against the 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
The sale of a franchise must be approved by three-fourths vote of the National 
League owners, and a simple majority vote by the American League owners. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jack Clark is slated to be the Padres' cleanup hitter this season, and 
will be protected by Joe Carter in the lineup, Clark said Sunday that he plans 
to meet with Padre Manager Jack McKeon to discuss the lineup order. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to sit down with Jack and make sure he's not just putting me 
fourth because of respect, or that he doesn't want to hurt my pride, or 
something," Clark said. "Joe's got a lot of speed, and can steal about 15, 20 
bases, so I don't want to slow him down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to tell Jack I'll do whatever's best for the team. I'll bat anywhere 
he wants, and I really don't care. I just want to win." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners were the only undefeated team, 4-0, in the Cactus League when they 
came to Yuma for their four-day visit. They returned home with a 4-4 record. 
Andy Benes was the winning pitcher Sunday, yielding six hits and one earned run 
in five innings. Jack Clark drove in two runs with a two-run double in the 
fifth inning. . . . "It's a pretty nice feeling having a lineup like this 
behind me," Benes said. "I don't have to go out there and throw a shutout. But 
at the same time, you can't just relax and say, 'We're going to score five or 
six runs.' " . . . The Padres are batting .301 this spring, averaging 7.3 runs 
a game. "Who's going to want to pitch to anyone in this lineup," said Padre 
second baseman Roberto Alomar, who's batting .476. Still, Padre Manager Jack 
McKeon is remaining cautious, reminding everyone, "Hey, we played pretty good 
(18-8) last spring too, and you remember what happened. This doesn't mean a 
thing." . . . The Padres drew their largest crowd of the spring Sunday, 2,573. 
They averaged just 1,881 in their eight home games, nearly 4,000 less than 
their 1989 average of 5,814.

<P>
ASTOR'S CREW PICKS UP WHERE WIND LEFT OFF

<P>
In Saturday's fleet race of the America's Schooner Cup, Astor skipper Richard 
Stramar left the sailing up to the wind. That was good enough for a two-minute 
victory over Dauntless. 
</P>
<P>
But in Sunday's match race with Dauntless for the Schooner Cup, there was no 
wind in sight -- so little, in fact, that the start had to be delayed an hour. 
</P>
<P>
So without his schooner's best friend alongside, Straman was forced to turn to 
another trusty companion, his 12-member crew. 
</P>
<P>
It did not let him down. 
</P>
<P>
Although it trailed for more than half the 10-mile match race, Astor wound up 
beating Dauntless by a bigger margin than Saturday, three minutes, 48 seconds, 
corrected time. 
</P>
<P>
Astor was given a three-minute handicap because of its larger dimensions. 
Stramar's schooner, built in 1924 by William Fife, is 15 feet longer than 
Dauntless, built in 1930 by John Alden. 
</P>
<P>
"This crew was great today," Straman said. "We had to make a lot of sail 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
After getting off to a great start Saturday on San Diego Bay, Astor almost 
didn't get started at all Sunday -- missing the buoy at the starting line by 
inches. If Astor had hit the marker, it would have had to start over. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a little too close," Straman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dauntless, skippered by Paul Plotts, took advantage of Astor's start to gain 
the early lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The first weather leg didn't go as well as we'd have liked, and we figured it 
would only get worse," Straman said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it only got better. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the halfway mark, Astor put up a fisherman's sail and began to take 
control. 
</P>
<P>
It led by 30 seconds at the mark and stretched that out considerably as the 
wind began to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
The Schooner Cup was Straman's first in three attempts. Last year he lost to 
Kelpie in the finals. Dauntless won the initial Schooner Cup in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Bagheera, Saturday's third-place finisher, won the consolation title by 29 
minutes over Volunteer.

SPLIT WITH BYU UPSETS AZTEC COACH 
</P>

<P>
After opening Western Athletic Conference play with a four game sweep of Utah 
March 23-25, the Aztecs appeared poised to continue their run right into the 
top 25. 
</P>
<P>
Some say a ranking would have been possible had they continued their winning 
ways last weekend against Brigham Young, which after playing 26 games on the 
road appeared to be physically taxed entering the series. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't turn out that way. The Aztecs could gain only a split with the 
road-weary Cougars, who came back to win the second game of double headers both 
Friday and Saturday. In the series finale Saturday night, BYU managed a 9-5 
victory -- and four of the Aztec runs came in the final inning, the bottom of 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU managed only two hits through six innings, at which time Coach Jim Dietz 
made wholesale changes. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz was so dismayed with his team that he spent nearly 20 minutes with them 
behind closed doors. When the clubhouse was finally opened to reporters, one 
player looked up at two writers and, in a hint at what kind of mood Dietz was 
in, said, "Good luck." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Dietz was angry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to lose," he gruffly explained. 
</P>
<P>
And he likes it even less when he feels his team gave away the victory. Dietz 
said that several of his players missed signs in the early innings of 
Saturday's second game and thus allowed BYU to take an overwhelming advantage, 
which reached 8-1 after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"So we had to play catch-up ball," Dietz said. "And that's one thing you can't 
do against BYU." 
</P>
<P>
The more Dietz thought about it, the more he disliked the effort put forth by 
his team. 
</P>
<P>
He said his young players appeared to be content with simply winning the first 
game. He complained about some of his players who went to a concert after 
Friday's double header, which concluded just after 10 p.m. He was upset about 
his players swinging at bad pitches and letting BYU starter Mike Nielsen get 
off easy. 
</P>
<P>
In short, he simply felt his team let a huge opportunity slip by. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're going for (the WAC championship) and you have the defending 
champion in your place . . . " said Dietz, not finishing his thought. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are 22-12, 6-2 in WAC. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who had lost four of their last six coming into the SDSU series, 
decided that if they hoped to defend their WAC title, well, then they had 
better start doing it against the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming in here and opening our (WAC) season against a fine team like San Diego 
State was the best thing that could have happened to us," said Gary Pullins, 
BYU coach. "It brought us out of our funk. We knew we couldn't lollygag around 
because we were playing a darn good ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Now the Cougars (16-14, 2-2 in WAC) can finally unpack their bags. They'll play 
their next 14 at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally when we finally get home," Pullins said, "we fire up and start 
winning."

SPRINGS OF LIVING WATER BY KAREN LAWRENCE VILLARD BOOKS $17.95;

'SPRINGS' FLOW FROM DEPICTION OF THE TROUBLED WATERS OF CHILDHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Miranda (Min) McCune lives in Southern California, has a good career as a 
photographer and has just wangled an advance from her publisher to travel in 
North and South America and Europe to take pictures of hot springs and the 
people who bathe in them. Externally, her life looks fine. She's in her middle 
30s, lives in Malibu and has a faithful boyfriend, Peter, who wants to settle 
down and get serious. If some of the facts in this paragraph already seem too 
good to be true, Min herself shares this disbelief: The life she has 
constructed has no roots in the mucky past she's grown up in. " 'Creating your 
own reality,' they called this in California. Here they believed that everyone 
possessed this lordly, ingenious power. You just had to snap out of that other 
way of thinking and it would come naturally, like buoyancy in salt water." 
</P>
<P>
But on the eve of her hot-springs assignment, Min is jerked rudely back into 
the past by a letter from her little sister, who tells her that their father, 
back in the family house in Wyandotte, Ontario, Canada, is very sick. Rina, who 
has stayed home while Min fled, could use some help. 
</P>
<P>
What this story is really about is the fear or the inability to step on out 
into life when your childhood has been so bad that all experience tells you 
that "life," as we know it, just isn't worth the time or trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Min's memories of her past are gloomy: "There was never enough room to get away 
from the others in her family. They were stranded together on a raft of misery. 
The recollection of all that pointless turbulence lived at her core and still 
did its work, chewing at her steadily. Her images of family were being 
cornered, hounded, deeply unhappy." And later, Min remembers, "punishment of 
all kinds was a grand scene in those days, in these houses . . . some child was 
always getting walloped, whacked, slapped, spanked, swatted, straightened out 
or licked. The streets echoed with promises. I'll lick you good. I'll really 
give you something to cry about. I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Min was raised by a furious and frightening mother who died of cancer before 
her capacity for instilling terror into her children could abate in the natural 
way. Min's father has worked at a meaningless job, could have been an inventor, 
and was left dazed and helpless by his wife's death. Rina, the baby sister, 
only 8 when the death occurred, was left as nothing more than a human ball of 
grief, a set of emotional demands that her older sister could never satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrow! Grief! Exasperation! Resentment! A strong wish to never never grow up 
to be like your parents, coupled with the sour knowledge that you can't help 
it, you're carrying their genetic imprint, your fate is sealed. (I know nothing 
at all about this sort of story, but some readers may be able to identify with 
this situation.) 
</P>
<P>
But what about the other side, those "springs of living waters?" Why does Min 
feel that she has to search them out, photograph them? 
</P>
<P>
During another chapter in her childhood, Min accompanied her fierce mother to a 
California hot spring to be cured of cancer by all the alternative ways: guided 
imagery, wheat-grass juice, immersion in healing springs. Min's first sense of 
what love might be has occurred in a spring with a young boy, dying of 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
These scenes are wonderful and I wish there had been more of them: How could a 
hard-case fiend like Min's mother ever cast her lot for even a few weeks with 
an outfit like the Ananda Institute? How did such transcendent 
hope/courage/foolishness ever find its way into her mean little body? Because a 
subtext in this story is that Min's mother lived her life at about 60% misery 
versus 40% hope, and that Min herself has just barely managed to reverse these 
statistics. How did that happen and why? 
</P>
<P>
When Min returns home to look at her past, she finds out more than she wants to 
know. Her father, in a moment of bitter communication, says, "living your own 
life -- my God, nobody we knew ever lived their own life." But her sister, 
Rina, who accompanies her to Europe, treasures whatever pleasure comes to her, 
chewing down pastries, saying, "This is as good as it gets. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Springs of Living Water" has some contrived passages, but the work is good. 
And the question it addresses -- how do you get over a terrible childhood, stop 
sulking and quivering about all the sadness you've encountered? -- may possibly 
be the most important personal question of our time. 
</P>

LIGHT, ROMANCE DOMINATE PLOSSU'S PICTURES 
</P>

<P>
It's no wonder that a certain romance dominates the work of photographer 
Bernard Plossu. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vietnam in 1945, Plossu grew up in Paris. He took his first photograph 
as a teen-ager while on a family trip in the African desert. At the age of 20, 
he left Paris to live with relatives in Mexico. He spent 10 years traveling the 
globe, taking pictures (currently on exhibit at the Museum of Photographic Arts 
in Balboa Park) throughout Europe, Africa, North and Central America and India, 
then settled in New Mexico for a few years, returning to Paris in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't that sound like a romantic life? 
</P>
<P>
Plossu's exhibit at MOPA, the first major American museum survey of his work, 
is titled "Desert Wind/Paris Rain," and the 110 photographs reflect his 
affinity for both urban and less-populated landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
Plossu is definitely from the low-tech school of photography. He uses only a 
35-millimeter camera with a 55-millimeter lens "because its normal vision 
allows me to be more self-effacing, and in doing so, to avoid exercises in 
style," he has said. In a statement accompanying the exhibit he says, "The only 
style is no style at all." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there seems to be a distinct style in much of Plossu's black-and-white 
work. Many of the photos are blurry and grainy, evoking another time. Even the 
most recent photos from 1988 have a vintage quality about them. And in many of 
the photos, particularly the shots from European locales (as in "Greece, 
1989"), Plossu uses the occasional human figure as a silhouette, resulting in 
haunting, romantic images. 
</P>
<P>
Like other photographers who work in this naturalistic style, Plossu is not a 
master of light -- he is its slave. Plossu recognizes the nature of the 
relationship and uses his eye to capture his master's gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best examples include a 1971 image from inside a Paris bus as a 
woman leans back in her seat and is bathed by a ray of light. In a 1975 shot 
taken in Agades, Niger, a man on a horse rides away from the camera and the sun 
at his back throws an eerie shadow onto a nearby wall. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most striking black-and-white image was also taken in Agades. 
</P>
<P>
Some sort of tribal ceremony is going on as a circle of men surround the 
participants. On the left, two men seem to be wrestling. On the right, a man 
plays a drum. In the middle, a figure is in a seated position, though no chair 
is discernable. The middle figure is shrouded by light and dust, creating a 
mysterious and other-wordly image. 
</P>
<P>
Plossu admits to cinematic influences, and they are exemplified by three 
photos, including a shot in a Paris cafe where a woman reaches across a table 
to caress another woman's head; in a 1966 shot from Mexico City where a woman's 
stockinged leg stretches across the top of the frame while a man in sunglasses 
smiles at the bottom; and another -- quite incongruous -- shot from Mexico, 
which looks like a still from a bad movie. In this photo, a European-looking 
couple sits in what seems to be a very small vehicle. They are dressed 
fashionably -- her hair in a scarf, a hat sitting jauntily on his head. Perched 
behind them are an obviously Mexican newlywed couple. She's in her wedding 
gown, smiling at the man behind the wheel. Next to her is her mate, wearing a 
cheap-looking black leather jacket and an uncertain look on his face. 
</P>
<P>
This last photo, though intriguing, also exemplifies the exhibit's weaknesses. 
The shots that are clearly focused, like the jets flying over Aztec ruins in 
Mexico or a shot of the Spanish shoreline, seem uncharacteristic and out of 
place next to the preponderance of darker, moodier work. And there is little 
exceptional in the 10 photos of Plossu's wife and children, save for the shot 
titled "Francoise and Joaquim on Stromboli Island." 
</P>
<P>
In this image, the photographer's wife and son stand facing the camera. Behind 
them is a large mountain jutting out of a body of water. But this is no 
portrait of the family on vacation. Characteristically, Plossu chooses to set 
his focus on the landscape in the background. In the foreground are the wife 
and child, blurred beyond recognition to anyone but their immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
Plossu's color images are as striking as his best black-and-white work -- 
albeit for different reasons. The images are developed utilizing a process 
created by turn-of-the-century inventor Theodore Henri Fresson. Certain details 
of the Fresson method are to this day an unpatented family secret and only a 
small number of images are produced annually by the family lab. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated process involves the use of carbon or pigment, instead of 
silver, on the photographic paper, producing richly textured images with highly 
saturated colors that have the quality of hand-tinted photographs. But it's all 
in the processing and the result is what is widely considered the most stable 
color photographs in existence, with a life span of almost 100 years before 
noticeable color shifts occur. 
</P>
<P>
The process is especially flattering to Plossu's desert images, heightening the 
colors of nature with a hyper-real vibrancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desert Wind/Paris Rain: Photographs of Bernard Plossu," on exhibit through 
May 13. MOPA is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursdays until 9 p.m. On 
Saturday at 3:30 p.m. at the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theatre, photographer, 
writer and curator William Messer will deliver a slide lecture on contemporary 
French photography. For more information, call MOPA, 239-5262.

Man Killed in Nelson Bus Crash: A motorist was killed Sunday when his car 
slammed head-on into a bus carrying singer Willie Nelson on a tour of eastern 
Canada, police said. The dead motorist was identified as Paul Leonard Burtch, 
20, of Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson and four others aboard the bus were unhurt in the crash, which forced 
the bus into a ditch. Burtch's car crossed the center line of Route 104 and hit 
Nelson's bus head-on about 3:30 a.m. near the town of Riversdale in Nova 
Scotia, Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. It was the second accident within 
the past month involving a performer on a tour bus. Singer Gloria Estefan 
suffered a broken back when her bus was hit by a truck in Pennsylvania on March 
24. CLAUDIA PUIG and GREG BRAXTON

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : MEDIA;

<P>
'PRINT GEEKS' A HOT ITEM FOR LOCAL TV TALK SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bizarre phenomenon in the local media world: San Diego print journalists are 
a hot ticket these days on the local television circuit. 
</P>
<P>
A hard-working, semi-articulate beat reporter can appear on at least three 
local shows a week. Besides the usual myriad of radio chatfests and cable 
access programs, KPBS-TV's (Channel 15) "San Diego Week," Cox Cable's "Cable 
Forum" and KNSD-TV's (Channel 39) "San Diego Headliners" all call on newspaper 
reporters -- ranging from media reporters like myself to political reporters -- 
to provide serious-sounding analysis of local issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Reporters are an untapped resource," said "San Diego Week" executive producer 
and host Gloria Penner-Snyder. "They're out there and they know what's going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego Week," which is in its third month of production, pays four 
reporters $50 each to gather in the KPBS studios Fridays at 7 a.m. to discuss 
the news topics of the week. Instead of having reporters quiz newsmakers, on 
"San Diego Week," which airs at 6 p.m. Fridays (and repeats at 5 p.m. Sundays), 
the reporters question each other about subjects like sewage and the strength 
of the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
For the gallant members of the Fourth Estate -- sometimes referred to as "print 
geeks" by their counterparts in television -- it is an opportunity to speak 
their minds, to show that they do indeed have some knowledge of the subjects 
they cover daily. Most print journalists, i.e. those without opinion columns, 
must suppress their true feelings and opinions to preserve the sensitive issue 
of pure objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
The television shows allow them to cut loose, or at least get their nice 
clothes out of mothballs for the show. 
</P>
<P>
"It is insight I'm looking for more than than reportage," said Penner-Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
There is precedent for this interest in print journalists. Shows on PBS, CNN, 
CBS and ABC all feature sharp-witted writers, providing the networks with 
experts, or at least people who think they're experts. 
</P>
<P>
Although the popularity of the shows varies, the local versions attract a 
guaranteed audience -- an audience of journalists. In the newsrooms of the San 
Diego dailies, people gather around television sets each Friday to either cheer 
or jeer their compatriots on "San Diego Week." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some may argue that print journalists should be read and not seen. 
Penner-Snyder disagrees. She said only that 10% of her writer guests have 
proven inappropriate, because of "behavioral characteristics." In other words, 
they couldn't speak well. 
</P>
<P>
"We're assuming that, when we think of reporters we have intelligent people," 
Penner-Snyder said. "If they can communicate by the written word it suggests a 
level of intelligence and an ability to convey ideas." 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans who love to sit by the radio and listen to a catchy instrumental 
arrangement of "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" or "The Theme to Hill Street 
Blues" may soon be without a radio station to call their own. 
</P>
<P>
Astute listeners of KJQY-FM (103.7) may have noticed a new upbeat twist in the 
station's music, which (some would argue) is rapidly losing its distinction as 
the the king of San Diego elevator music. It's hardly entering the rock 'n' 
roll derby, but the station has added a few more toe-tappers, dropping some of 
its sappy instrumentals in the process. 
</P>
<P>
KJOY, as the station is known, began adding radical songs, i.e. those with 
vocals, last year, when it switched to an "Adult Spectrum" format developed by 
station general manager Bert Whalen for Group W's FM stations throughout the 
country. The station's ratings have been on a steady slide for the past 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The latest changes are the result of "continuous testing of the marketplace," 
Whalen said, noting that in the last year the station was unable to budget 
money for research because of Group W's plans to sell the station. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of instrumental covers of hits were not acceptable" to KJOY's listeners, 
Whalen said. The station now is playing only about 30% instrumentals. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Whalen said his efforts continue to buy the station from Command 
Broadcasting, which purchased the station a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Channel 17 plan to meet with Federal Communications 
Commission officials today in an attempt to resolve problems that have 
frustrated their efforts to put the low-power television station on the air. 
</P>
<P>
The station (which doesn't have call letters yet) has hired staff, and it has 
been taping events for several months while it awaits approval from the FCC, 
which must coordinate approval with the Mexican government. Due to the location 
of Channel 17's transmitter, the Mexican government must be satisfied that the 
signal will not interfere with any Mexican signals before the FCC can approve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Station manager Glenn Shoemaker hopes to have the station on the air by June. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Tribune circulation department representative, explaining the 
paper's new North County strategy last week, matter-of-factly told an 
incredulous group of the paper's editors that the paper's representatives have 
been following Blade-Citizen carriers to discover the addresses of the 
Oceanside-based newspaper's readers. Common practice, the circulation rep said. 
Did they wear disguises, an editor asked? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Landmark Theaters was forced to cancel a press screening of the controversial 
"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" last week when the print didn't 
arrive in time. The distributor sent it to Landmark's Park Theater. 
Unfortunately it was Landmark's theater in Menlo Park, not San Diego. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After KKYY-FM (Y95) fired off a letter to their old morning team, "Jeff 'n' 
Jer," their new employer, KFMB-FM (B100), agreed not to use their name or 
likeness until their contract with Y95 expires later this month. The duo is 
expected to start at B100 on April 25. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-AM's (760) death row phone interview with Robert Alton Harris has been 
picked up by all three television networks, the BBC and "Hard Copy," in 
addition to stations in Los Angeles and San Francisco. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KGTV's (Channel 10) news updates throughout the day on "Headline News" debut 
today. . . . If you call information for the phone number for XHRM-FM (92.5),d 
the operator will give the number for the office of former station manager 
Willie Morrow, who has been in an often-bitter dispute with the station's 
owners. Ask Morrow's office staff for the station's new number and they say 
they don't have it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KYXY-FM (96.5) radio personality Sam Bass, modestly referred to in a press 
release as the "King of Midday Radio," has signed a new long-term deal with the 
"longer listening" station. Not exactly a surprise. He's been with the station 
for 12 years. . . . According to Inside Radio, KKLQ (Q106) program director 
Garry Wall has been called upon to clean up after a "blood bath" at Edens 
Broadcasting's Tampa station, WRBQ-AM/FM, where three top staffers were 
suddenly fired.

Museum Director Named: Fritz A. Frauchiger, chief executive officer of 
Honolulu's Contemporary Museum and former curator of the ARCO Center for Visual

effective July 1. "We are extremely pleased with his California background, his 
art background, education and experience," said Marshall M. Gelfand, museum 
board president. Frauchiger, who will succeed Morton Golden, was selected 
through "an exhaustive search" conducted by Korn/Ferry International, the firm 
that has placed many prominent museum directors. CLAUDIA PUIG and GREG BRAXTON

Eastwood Sues Tabloid: Actor Clint Eastwood has filed a $20-million lawsuit 
against the Globe, accusing the supermarket tabloid of fabricating a front-page 
story headlined, "Clint's Life Threatened by Nazi Cult." Eastwood's lawsuit, 
filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, contends that the tabloid's Jan. 1 story, 
featuring a photo of Eastwood holding a handgun, has put the actor's life in 
danger. The Globe story says a group called the Aryan Nation had put a $100,000 
bounty on Eastwood's life because the actor refused to speak at the 
organization's convention in Washington. CLAUDIA PUIG and GREG BRAXTON

Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has set in motion plans to start five 
more Jewish settlements in Israel's occupied territories, an aide, Yossi 
Ahimeir, said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor Party had 
postponed construction of five of eight settlements in response to U.S. 
protests. The defense minister has final say on when settlements will be built. 
Ahimeir noted that Shamir is now acting as defense minister, a post he took 
over after Labor members resigned from the Cabinet on March 13.

Retired state Supreme Court Justice Marcus M. Kaufman will join a Los Angeles

</P>
<P>
Kaufman, 60, a 1987 appointee of Gov. George Deukmejian, resigned from the 
court effective Jan. 31, but is remaining to complete work on cases in which he 
participated. Deukmejian appointed Justice Armand Arabian to replace him. The 
firm of Buchalter, Nemer, Fields &amp; Younger said Kaufman would be involved 
in appellate matters, provide litigation strategy and technical knowledge, and 
take part in education programs for the firm's 170 lawyers. Kaufman "brings a 
wealth of experience to bear on California judicial matters at the highest 
levels," said Jack Samet, head of the firm's litigation department.

Members of the San Diego Newspaper Guild ended a bitter labor dispute with the 
Union-Tribune Publishing Co., voting begrudgingly to accept a new, two-year 
contract but saying all is not well at San Diego's two largest newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Guild members voted 227 to 78 to accept the new labor package that calls, among 
other things, for an immediate 10% pay raise -- the first pay increase for many 
employees since December, 1987. The contract negotiated by the guild covers 
1,100 employees in the editorial, advertising, circulation and business 
departments. Guild President Ed Jahn said members felt resigned to accept the 
new contract because it was the best they could expect to muster from the 
company.

GADGET BASH IS A SMASHING SUCCESS ON EVE OF FOOLISHNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Let the record show that on April Fool's Eve, four-dozen adults at a South 
Pasadena party cheered as they witnessed the willful and gleeful destruction, 
by sledge-hammer and otherwise, of the following malfunctioning products of the 
technological age: 
</P>
<P>
A color television that reportedly conked out during the NCAA Final Four 
basketball playoffs, a clock radio whose alarm worked only half the time, an 
answering machine that hasn't worked in 25 years and a cassette player whose 
cord was replaced nine times but still failed to function. 
</P>
<P>
"In our modern society, we are forced to trust machines. They often betray that 
trust," said Alan Barnum-Scrivener of Bellflower as he surveyed the aftermath 
of smashed picture tubes, torn-apart circuitry and shards of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "We don't have a formal mechanism to address that." 
</P>
<P>
Enter "Electro-Bash." 
</P>
<P>
The event, organizers said, was first held last year to battle a condition they 
described as Consumer Electronics Stress Syndrome. Victims are unable to throw 
away dysfunctional electronic gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
"Electro-Bash provides relief from this terrible psychic burden," said the 
official statement for this year's gathering. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people hold onto their stuff even when they know it won't be fixed or 
can't be fixed. It's a problem on a national scale," Ben C. Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who wore a pointed jester's cap and an impish grin, co-hosted the 
party with Steve E. Tice at their two-story duplex. Thompson lives downstairs; 
Tice upstairs. They are colleagues in Southern California's computer and 
aerospace industries. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson insisted that the celebration of destructiveness was not necessarily 
inspired by David Letterman's late-night television show. But it certainly 
evoked comparisons to some of the antics on the Letterman program. 
</P>
<P>
With balconies on each floor overlooking a driveway, the rear of Thompson and 
Tice's duplex provided an ideal spot for bashing and watching. Hanging sheets 
of plastic surrounded a plywood-covered driveway where an industrial vise 
served as the target for items dropped from the second story during the party's 
"Slam-Dunk" segment. 
</P>
<P>
As 26-year-old Ivor Kulikov of Hollywood tossed his television, a 
black-and-white image flickered even as it went over the balcony. With a video 
camera recording its flight, Kulikov's television had been hooked up to 
televise its own destruction. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives a new meaning to 'viewer discretion advised,' " Scott Jacobs, a San 
Fernando Valley resident, said as he inspected another shattered television set 
after its stomach-wrenching, noisy destruction. "Funny thing," he said, "after 
the set exploded it switched to the Morton Downey show." 
</P>
<P>
Sledge-hammer wielding participants wore protective glasses in the 
"Sledge-O-Matic" that followed. 
</P>
<P>
"Bash it!" the crowd implored Thompson as he took aim at a calculator atop the 
vise. He readily complied. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Rivera of North Hollywood, accompanied by the rap song "Fight the Power," 
danced around her clock radio, cracked two eggs on it and sprayed it first with 
shaving cream, then with green and orange Day-Glo paint. It later got smashed

From the second-floor balcony, Pasadena's Denny Dillion, an engineer, dropped a 
commode onto a computer terminal and keyboard. Then, when he went to finish it 
off with a sledge-hammer, the crowd shouted computer language: "Hit return key! 
Shift! Escape! Control-Alt-Delete!" Using the hammer, he obliged. 
</P>
<P>
Although some neighbors had been notified, not everyone got the word. Well into 
the party, about 10:40 p.m., three Jacuzzi-clad people sauntered up with 
stunned looks to witness the Sledge-O-Matic. One said: "We thought someone was 
tearing up a house." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, a contingent of South Pasadena policemen arrived to say they 
were responding to a complaint of possible gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
"No, just safe smashing," Thompson told the officers, assuring them that the 
bashing was completed as they witnessed Tice sledge-hammer a toaster oven amid 
vain shouts of "Don't bash it. It's still under warranty."

35 ARRESTED IN DRUG RAID AT CARSON TOWNHOUSES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DEPUTIES RESPONDING TO NEIGHBORHOOD COMPLAINTS PICK UP 12 SUSPECTED 
NARCOTICS DEALERS AND 23 ALLEGED CUSTOMERS.

Growing up in a heavily industrialized area of Carson, Lori Lee said, she and 
other children from the community earned extra money by taking part-time jobs 
at fast-food restaurants and supermarkets along Avalon and Sepulveda boulevards 
-- the neighborhood's main thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
Now the young and the old in the Scottsdale Town Houses, where she lives with 
her family, sell drugs instead, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to neighborhood complaints, a monthlong investigation into drug 
dealing at the large townhouse development culminated Saturday when Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies arrested 12 suspected drug dealers and 23 customers 
at three homes in the 350-unit complex, said Sheriff's Sgt. Terry Judge. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies with search warrants went to the homes on Boothill, Geronimo and 
Lariat lanes, where they seized 190 grams of marijuana, an undetermined amount 
of money, five handguns and a rifle, Judge said. Ten men and two women -- whose 
names were not available -- were arrested and booked on charges of possession 
and sale of cocaine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the alleged drug dealers were arrested, deputies posed as drug dealers 
and began selling rock cocaine to unsuspecting customers around the complex, 
Judge said. A total of 23 customers -- 20 men and three women -- were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
These suspects were booked on charges that included being under the influence 
of a controlled substance, possession of cocaine and being an ex-felon with a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for all those arrested ranged from $20,000 to $1,000, Judge said. 
</P>
<P>
As Lee, a 27-year-old private nurse, reflected Sunday on the arrests at the 
townhouse complex, she said: "This used to be a nice place. People used to have 
barbecues, kids used to be on the playgrounds. We used to have parties at the 
town center (the activity room in the complex) and people used to have house 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, in the '80s and '90s, with this drug world, that's taken care of 
everything and how everyone lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And many Scottsdale residents -- a diverse racial and ethnic mix -- expressed 
doubt Sunday that the arrests would do little to combat the drug problem in the 
area, also a known site of heavy gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is never going to change," said saleswoman Evelyn Demerath, 20, who 
has lived at the complex since she was 12. "You probably get kids here, 9 or 10 
years old, selling dope with their beepers. You can only go to jail so many 
times, but for them, they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents said they wished police would do more to crack down on the drug 
trafficking -- saying that a more continual presence would deter drug dealers 
and buyers, while providing comfort to those who are frightened by the drug 
crimes in their area. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've moved down here, my life has changed," said Sergio Salcido, 18, who 
moved to Scottsdale from Torrance four months ago with his family. "Now I'm 
scared and, at the same time, I think about fighting back and killing people if 
they do something to me. I want some protection."

VALIUM SNAPS VEGETATIVE STATE

<P>
An accident victim who has been in a vegetative state for seven years underwent 
a "total transformation" and began speaking to doctors when he was given Valium 
before a dental procedure, a doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Andres Kanner, a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy cases, said last 
week that the Wisconsin man suddenly emerged from his vegetative state about 
two weeks ago when he was given an intravenous injection of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"He started interacting in a reasonable manner, a total transformation," said 
Kanner, a doctor at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in 
Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Kanner said that the man is able to say his name, read and write. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we don't know the reason for this phenomenon," Kanner said. 
</P>
<P>
The patient, who is in his mid-40s but was not identified at the request of his 
family, was injured in a car accident about 10 years ago. He was in a coma for 
about three months but was able to communicate with those around him when he 
first regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
His condition deteriorated in the next two years and Kanner said he lapsed into 
a vegetative state in which he seldom responded to people or his environment, 
rarely saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't in a coma," Kanner said. "He was in a vegetative-like state in which 
a patient is unresponsive to people around him. He was hardly talking at all 
and not following commands . . . just lying in bed and not participating in a 
purposeful manner." 
</P>
<P>
The patient began interacting with doctors and others in a reasonable manner 
for a short period of time, Kanner said. The man lapsed back into the 
vegetative state when the Valium wore off.

<P>
Seven AIDS patients taking the experimental drug DDI have now died of 
pancreatitis and 71 other patients have developed non-fatal cases of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
The updated information was released last week by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. of 
New York, DDI's manufacturer, in a letter to physicians treating the 8,300 AIDS 
patients receiving the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol-Myers warned that the patients should be monitored closely for signs of 
the digestive ailment, such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and that 
medications that can cause pancreatitis should be avoided. Bristol-Myers also 
said patients receiving DDI should be advised not to drink alcohol, which can 
cause pancreatitis, which is an inflammation of the pancreas.

SATELLITES FIND NO TREND OF GREENHOUSE WARMING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite fears that the greenhouse effect is heating up the Earth's atmosphere, 
measurements taken by satellites show the planet has not warmed over the past 
decade, scientists said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and University of Alabama 
in Huntsville said they found dramatic swings in monthly and yearly temperature 
patterns, but the average global temperature did not rise -- or fall -- in the 
10-year period from 1979 through 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no obvious long-term trend, and anomalies during the first five years 
nearly balance those during the last five years," researchers Roy Spencer and 
John Christy wrote in a study published in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists emphasized their findings go back only as far as 1979, and 
cannot be used to determine whether Earth has actually warmed about 1 degree 
Farhenheit over the past century, as most ground-based records show. 
</P>
<P>
"We may never show the climate is affected by man-made pollution. But we have 
no contention with the obvious facts -- that the chemical composition of the 
atmosphere is affected, that deforestation is occurring, that water supplies 
are being degraded and that there is air pollution," he said.

ADRIFT IN A SEA OF COALITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL'S SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO EVOLVE IF IT IS TO COPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel's late coalition government experienced many failures. Among the 
greatest was its inability to deal with the compelling need for electoral 
reform. The consequences are again wearisomely apparent as inconclusive 
maneuvering continues over who will lead and who will take part in the next 
government. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve a parliamentary majority, either Labor or Likud (the two major 
political blocs) needs considerable support from among the other 13 marginal 
parties represented in the Knesset. That requires delicate negotiations and 
balancing of the competing demands of one special interest group against 
another. It's a tedious and not always dignified process. For a democracy 
facing urgent challenges that call for clear and prompt decisions, it can be 
dangerous as well. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Labor and Likud between them have controlled 79 of the Knesset's 
120 seats, more than enough to legislate changes to eliminate the 
disproportionate influence so long enjoyed by fringe parties. No party in 
Israel has ever won an electoral majority at the polls. Coalitions have thus 
always been the rule. Until the 1984 shotgun marriage of Labor and Likud, those 
coalitions included one or more of the religious parties. In a largely secular 
society, that participation has given the religious minority an extraordinary 
claim on patronage and special privileges. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem with Israel's politics isn't parochial, it's systemic. The 
multiplicity of parties that emerged with the birth of the state reflected 
Israel's cultural heterogeneity and the Zionist movement's historic divisions. 
Get three Israelis together in a room, the old joke goes, and they will soon 
form four political parties. Some say the continuance of the multiparty system 
indicates the freewheeling vibrancy of Israeli politics. From a larger 
perspective, it's arguably an indication of an outmoded political immaturity, 
of a refusal to compromise to obtain more efficient and, yes, more truly 
democratic government. That's why public opinion in Israel is increasingly 
supporting the call for electoral reform. 
</P>
<P>
Reform, though, is for the future. Labor and Likud each hope to lead the next 
government. Each, though, now seems unable to command more than a non-majority 
60 votes in the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
What should come next? The best course -- and not for reasons of electoral 
reform alone -- is to forget about coalition-building and move on to new 
elections, in hope of breaking a crippling political deadlock. Granted, the 
next election could again prove inconclusive. But at least it would give 
Israelis a chance to try to end the policy paralysis of recent years. Who 
knows: It could even bring closer the time when an anachronistic electoral 
system can be abandoned.

AZZI GOES HOME AND STANFORD COMES AWAY WITH WOMEN'S TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Accepting the award for most valuable player for leading her team to the 
national championship -- Jennifer Azzi. 
</P>
<P>
Who else? 
</P>
<P>
The hometown girl, who left Oak Ridge, Tenn., four years ago only to return to 
nearby Knoxville to finish her career before thousands of cheering fans, scored 
17 points, had five assists and grabbed four rebounds in helping Stanford down 
Auburn, 88-81. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9 Azzi received a standing ovation from a record 
national-championship crowd of 16,595 when she fouled out with with 1:28 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, she was atop the stand at mid-court in Thompson-Boling 
arena Sunday with the award in her hand and a national championship ring on her 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't describe how I feel inside right now. All I know is that it feels 
really good," Azzi said. "Katy (Steding) and I have played four years together, 
and all in one moment all that hard work has paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently so. Azzi and fellow seniors Steding and Stacy Parson are credited 
with leading the transformation of a 5-23 program into a 32-1 national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn (28-7), with three consecutive unsuccessful tries in the title game, 
kept up with the Cardinal for 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But after coming out of the locker room tied, 41-41, Stanford's quickness and 
teamwork took its toll on Auburn's defensive press. 
</P>
<P>
Center Trisha Stevens put the Cardinal ahead, 48-46, with a four-foot shot from 
the lane with 17:32 left, and Stanford eventually built a lead that proved 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
A six-foot hook by the 6-3 Stevens -- who finished with 16 points and 10 
rebounds -- put the Cardinal up by six with 14:45 left, and Auburn could get no 
closer after that. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers came within seven points after a three-point basket by guard Evelyn 
Thompson with 1:05 left, but she fouled Stanford guard Sonja Henning, who made 
both free throws to stop the Tigers' momentum. "We wanted to attack the middle, 
and (Henning) and (Azzi) read the defense and attacked," Stanford Coach Tara 
VanDerveer said. "We haven't been pressed much all season, but there's a reason 
for that -- it opens up the opportunity for the three (front-line players), and 
we look at it as an opportunity for the fast break." 
</P>
<P>
Auburn Coach Joe Ciampi's assesment of Stanford: "They have so many weapons and 
defensively they gave us big problems. We anticipated concentrating on (Trisha) 
Stevens, Azzi and Steding to start . . . but you never know." 
</P>
<P>
That left the floor open to Henning, who scored 21 points and grabbed nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"My disbelief was with how quick they got the shot off," Ciampi said. "We felt 
we could get back and be in position to get back and contest the shot. They 
were shooting three-point hots (as accurately) as we were layups." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford shot 42.3% from three-point range, hitting 11 of 26. Azzi was four of 
eight from the three-point line. Steding, who finished with 18 points and five 
assists, was six of 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal broke the Auburn press early and forced the Tigers into playing 
one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
Steding and Azzi, with five three-point shots between them in the first seven 
minutes, sparked the Cardinal to an 11-point lead, and it appeared a blowout 
was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
But Auburn fought back and took a 28-27 lead with 7:43 left in the first half 
and widened the margin to 41-32 with 2:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford scored the next nine points to tie the game, 41-41. And for the next 
20 minutes, determination and execution of the Stanford machine proved 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a team in every sense," Azzi said. "And our success comes from within 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was saddened by never again wearing a Stanford uniform, Azzi 
responded: "I feel so good now, at this moment. I'm sad knowing I'll never wear 
a Stanford jersey again, but I'm glad it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
VanDerveer: "When she came out (after her fifth foul) I wasn't thinking about 
it. Then it hit me -- I won't see Jennifer and (Parson) play again. So I'm 
happy, but I'm sad." 
</P>
<P>
NCAA Women's Notes 
</P>
<P>
Both tournament and single season attendance records were set at the 1990 Final 
Four. The paid attendance for both games totaled 39,490, the turnstile count 
34,196. Paid attendance for the 1987 Final Four at Austin, Tex., totalled 
31,230, and the third all-time high was 18,788 at last year's tournament at 
Tacoma, Wash. . . . The all-tournament team for this year's Final Four included 
Jennifer Azzi (MVP), Katy Steding of Stanford, Venus Lacy of Louisiana Tech, 
Chantel Tremitiere of Auburn and Carolyn Jones of Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Sonja Henning did not make the team, despite an outstanding 
tournament in which she shot 50% and averaged 12 points and more than seven 
assists a game. . . . Jones, a 5-6 guard, was high scorer for Auburn with 16 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA women's basketball rules committee has instituted changes for next 
season: players fouled while attempting a three-point basket will be given 
three free throws if the basket is missed; if a goaltending call is made during 
a free throw, a point will be awarded and the team causing the infraction will 
be assessed a technical foul; and in jump-ball situations, the ball will be 
awarded out of bounds at the spot closest to where the situation occurs. The 
ball had been awarded at the sideline.

LAKERS STILL LOOK LIKE THE BEST IN WEST BY BEATING JAZZ, 119-103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Patrick Riley, only 5 years old but already well-versed in media 
manipulation, stood beside his father after the Lakers' 119-103 victory over 
the Utah Jazz Sunday at the Forum and was asked whether the race for the 
Western Conference's best record had been decided. 
</P>
<P>
The little Riley shook his head then buried his face behind his father's leg. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were not preparing acceptance speeches for earning the home-court 
advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs, even though that now 
seems inevitable. Victories over the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and 
the Jazz on Sunday have put the Lakers (54-17) four games ahead in the loss 
column with 11 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Lakers' sights are set on the NBA's best record. After Sunday's 
easy victory, in which they made 61% of their shots and outrebounded the Jazz 
by 12, the Lakers are two games in front of the Detroit Pistons in the loss 
column. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not over," the bigger Riley said. "It's up to us. If we can get through 
this week coming up, if we can win those (road games) against Phoenix and 
Denver, then we'll be in good shape. Because, you know, we're still pointing at 
the league's best record." 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers play as efficiently and as inspired as they did Sunday, the 
league's best record heading into the playoffs will be assured. They got 33 
points and 13 assists from Magic Johnson, 25 points from Byron Scott, 23 from 
James Worthy and, perhaps most important, center Mychal Thompson's 12 points, 
11 rebounds and an effective defensive effort against forward Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the impressive victory, the Lakers refused to talk about clinching the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we just give it away ourselves, unless we go in the tank, and I don't 
think it'll happen," said Johnson, when asked about the prospect of finishing 
with the best record. "But I'm saying it could happen if we don't come out 
ready to play. We can't afford a mental lapse right now. Portland, Utah and 
Detroit are on our tail." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have won three in a row since their 19-point loss at Portland 
Tuesday night. They rebounded from that spanking by holding off the Clippers 
without Johnson, then beating the Trail Blazers by 29 points on Friday night 
and Utah by 16. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lakers still have road games at Phoenix and Denver this week, at 
Utah on April 12 and at Portland on April 22, they emerged from their most 
difficult week in fine shape. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's victory may not have been as statistically dominating as the victory 
over Portland, but the Lakers took control at the start and did not let up. 
</P>
<P>
They held Utah to eight rebounds in the first half, tying the Jazz's all-time 
low for a half. Thompson draped himself over Malone and held him to seven 
first-half points. Conversely, the Lakers shot 62.5% and had 18 rebounds en 
route to a 15-point first-half lead. 
</P>

Utah, which has lost two consecutive games, made the expected second-half 
comeback. Malone finished with 25 points, six below his season average, and 
John Stockton had 15 points and 15 assists. But the Lakers maintained at least 
a 10-point lead throughout the second half. "We're trying to get prepared for 
the playoffs," Johnson said. "This was a big week. We had to make some 
statements against some of the best teams in the West. Our problem is that 
we've been relatively consistent all year, but we haven't played really well 
for long periods of time. That's what we're trying to do now." 
</P>
<P>
There were few flaws in the Lakers' game on Sunday. Scott, who made 10 of 14 
shots, was hot from the perimeter. Worthy, who made 10 of 16 shots, was 
effective inside. Johnson ran the offense with his customary expertise, even 
though still he was slightly hobbled by a sprained right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
But Thompson's play, especially his first-half defense against Malone, was a 
deciding factor. 
</P>
<P>
"He is vital to us," Riley said of Thompson. "I thought the other night against 
(Portland's Kevin) Duckworth and today against Malone in the first half showed 
what Mychal can do. He's our best defender in the post." 
</P>
<P>
Malone scored 12 points in the third quarter, many coming when Thompson was on 
the bench. But Thompson tried to match strength with Malone and keep him from 
dominating inside. Malone opened the game by making two outside jump shots and 
two free throws, but Thompson was waiting for him when he ventured inside. With 
4:30 left in the first half, Malone rebounded Delaney Rudd's errant jump shot 
and Thompson blocked Malone's follow shot. Malone appeared surprised; that 
usually does not happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also outrebounded Malone, 11-6, and the Laker center made six of seven 
shots. Many of Thompson's baskets came on strong inside rushes or dunks on 
passes from Johnson. Johnson said he had told Thompson to stop using finesse 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I get so mad at him because he normally doesn't do what he did today," Johnson 
said, smiling. "He dunked it today, rather than missing those two- or 
three-footers. I'm not really mad at him, but, you know, I just wanted to tell 
him to dunk it. "Mychal doesn't get the credit for what he does. He sets the 
best picks to let guys get open of anyone on the team. He and A.C. (Green) and 
Vlade (Divac) have to do all the dirty work, like today against Karl." 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz (50-21) seems more concerned with holding off San Antonio for the 
Midwest Division title. The Spurs are two games behind. But Utah still harbors 
hope of catching the Lakers. "Anything can happen," Stockton said. "We haven't 
given up yet." 
</P>
<P>
Malone, however, gave as close to a concession speech as anyone on either team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure everybody would like the home-court advantage, but when you lose one 
home game in the playoffs, you lose the advantage, anyway," Malone said. "We've 
proven we can beat (the Lakers) here before. It's going to be tough wherever 
you play. This is going to be the toughest playoff race ever in the Western 
Conference." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy said his lower back spasms, which forced him to miss a recent 
game, have subsided. "It's a lot better," Worthy said. "Now, it's just been 
reduced to a sore back." . . . Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan was impressed with the 
Laker defense. "It was the best defensive performance I've ever seen from 
them," Sloan siad. "They went after us right at the start. They outworked us on 
rebounding. They were pushing and shoving us around. They got the momentum from 
the defensive play on the court." . . . The Lakers do not play again until 
Thursday night against Sacramento at the Forum.

<P>
TELEVISION: TONIGHT'S NCAA BASKETBALL TELECAST WILL BE ANNOUNCER'S LAST 
ASSIGNMENT FOR NETWORK.

<P>
The initial reaction dealt with the calendar, rather than the Sunday 
announcement that announcer Brent Musburger had been fired by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
It was, after all, April 1, and it also was the day before Musburger was to 
handle play-by-play of the NCAA championship basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS Sports announced today that it had declined to renew Brent Musburger's 
employment agreement, which expires within the next few months," CBS 
spokeswoman Susan Kerr told reporters. "Brent's final event for CBS Sports will 
be the NCAA men's championship game on Monday, April 2, 1990." 
</P>
<P>
"I heard it as a rumor in the locker room in Ft. Lauderdale," said Frank 
Cashen, New York Met general manager whose announcer, Tim McCarver, was set to 
work with Musburger on the lead games of the CBS major league baseball series 
beginning April 14. "I dismissed it as an April Fool's joke." 
</P>
<P>
A worker at CBS Sports in New York called the Associated Press with a similar 
reaction, insisting that it wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters here had the same idea -- which was quickly dispelled. "It is not a 
joke," said CBS Sports President Neal Pilson. "It's a difficult decision. It's 
never easy to deal with individuals with whom you have personal or business 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was apparently made when long-running negotiations between 
Musburger's agent -- his brother, Todd -- and CBS officials broke off in 
Denver. Musburger's 5 1/2-year contract that pays $2 million annually runs 
through July, but the network decided to relieve him of duties after tonight. 
"It wouldn't have been right to have him start baseball and not be around to 
finish the season," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger issued a statement through his personal assistant, Jimmy Tubbs. "I 
was surprised, but it was a great run and I have a million memories, and I 
leave behind a lot of good friends," Musburger said. "At this time, I'm going 
to take an extended vacation, and I'll be working again someday, somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't right out of the blue," Tubbs said. "He knew for a couple of days 
that things were not going well in contract negotiations. Negotiations had been 
going on and they just broke off." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Musburger had asked for a CBS decision on a new contract by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty in negotiations apparently had to do with Musburger's role under 
the new contract. It was understood that his presence would be diminished -- 
with, presumably, diminished salary -- even though the network had added 
baseball and the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1994 Summer Olympics to its sports 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great group of young broadcasters. They are our present and our 
future," said Ted Shaker, executive producer of CBS Sports, who added that the 
network believed Musburger's work load was "too much." 
</P>
<P>
Among those young broadcasters is Jim Nantz, who has handled studio work for 
the NCAA basketball tournament, and Greg Gumbel and James Brown, who have done 
play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply felt we wanted to give more opportunities to some of the younger 
people who currently work for us," Pilson said. "There's never a good time to 
have to announce a decision like this. We were asked by Brent's representative 
to make a decision, and that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
Money, it was said, was not the prevailing factor to the decision. "It's like a 
divorce," Kerr said. "You can't point to any one thing." 
</P>
<P>
Immediate speculation began as to Musburger's replacement on the CBS baseball 
series, for which the network outbid NBC, paying more than $1 billion for four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
One name mentioned was Al Michaels, who is under contract to ABC, but has been 
reportedly disenchanted with the network. He reportedly was suspended for two 
weeks recently when his teen-age daughter was hired as an on-site messenger at 
the U.S. Figure Skating Championships at Salt Lake City, violating a nepotism 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Another scenario had CBS elevating Jack Buck from his backup game assignments 
with Jim Kaat to the primary game with McCarver, an old friend who played with 
the St. Louis Cardinals, for whom Buck has worked since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Buck said he was surprised by the firing. "This was a sudden thing," he said in 
St. Petersburg, Fla., where he is announcing Cardinal spring training games. 
"We talked about doing this game on April 14, this game the second week. There 
was no mention of Brent not doing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
McCarver was said to be meeting with CBS officials at the Mets training site in 
Port St. Lucie, Fla., and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Still another had CBS hiring Vin Scully, the Dodger announcer whose contract 
with NBC ended when the network lost major league baseball to CBS. Scully 
worked for CBS from 1975 to 1982, doing pro football and golf. 
</P>
<P>
He declined comment Sunday at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Other names mentioned include Gumbel and Dick Stockton, the NBA lead announcer 
who does baseball for CBS radio and was a play-by-play announcer for the Boston 
Red Sox. Stockton would appear to be tied to the NBA broadcasts through June. 
</P>
<P>
Pilson said that an announcement on the CBS baseball package would be made this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger, a former newspaper sports columnist in Chicago, became host of CBS's 
"The NFL Today" in 1975 and immediately became both known and criticized for 
bringing a bland personality to the broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he was criticized for shilling for CBS events on the air. 
</P>
<P>
He has anchored the Masters golf tournament, the NBA finals, the Pan American 
Games and late-night coverage of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, among other 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Daniels, who owns the Prime Ticket sports network, said Sunday in Denver 
he had instructed network president John Severino to talk with Musburger about 
a new nightly sports news show that Prime Ticket will begin in August.

NICKLAUS WINS BY FOUR SHOTS AT TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: FIRST APPEARANCE ON SENIOR TOUR GIVES HIM CONFIDENCE HEADING INTO THE 
MASTERS.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus is halfway to the first goal he has set for himself in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, whose ambition is to be the first to win on the Senior PGA Tour and 
on the regular tour in the same season, breezed to a four-stroke victory in the 
$800,000 Tradition Sunday on the Cochise course at Desert Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bruce Crampton and Gary Player both made runs at him, Nicklaus took 
over the lead with a sensational birdie on the fifth hole, a 408-yard, 
par-four, and he was never challenged thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus birdied three of the last six holes and finished with a four-under-par 
68. His 206 total for three rounds was 10 under par. 
</P>
<P>
Player shot a final-round 70, but lost ground and finished at 210. Crampton and 
Charles Coody tied for third at 212. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by his finish, Nicklaus said he was looking forward to the Masters 
and felt he could contend. He also said he would play in several senior 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
After sinking a birdie putt on No. 9 to stretch his lead to three strokes, the 
only difficulty he encountered was the weather. A rainstorm wiped out 
Thursday's round and shortened the tournament to 54 holes. During the final 
round it was lightning, which arrived as Nicklaus bogeyed No. 12. Play was 
halted for a little more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, worth $120,000, came after three dismal performances on the 
regular tour. Among other things, it gave Nicklaus confidence in his bid to win 
another Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cold and rainy week, Nicklaus, thanks in no small part to the 
coaching of Jim Flick, hit some prodigious shots. He had several drives 
measuring between 320 and 345 yards, one-irons more than 230 yards, a 
seven-iron 190 and a three-wood 250. Even the youngsters on the regular tour 
don't get any more distance. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus changed his format to protect the two-shot lead he had entering the 
final 18 holes. He built his lead with bold shots on the par fives, playing 
them seven under par, while going one over on the par fours. But Sunday, he 
mostly played the long holes conservatively and it cost him two bogeys. But he 
overcame that by getting four birdies on par fours. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest birdie was on the 408-yard fifth hole. His drive wound up in high 
grass on the bank of a fairway trap. With a seven-iron, Nicklaus put the next 
shot 10 feet past the hole, then sank the putt for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus said he didn't know what he would do Sunday after going so long 
without being in contention on the last day. He just wanted to keep his 
composure. 
</P>
<P>
The first hole ended his worries. He hit a drive of almost 300 yards on the par 
four. Then, his nine-iron landed one-inch from the cup, hit the flag and was 
two feet away. He sank the putt and was on his way. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, who finished with a 72 despite a quadruple bogey on the short, 
difficult No. 6, hit his blind second shot into rocks in the wasteland. He said 
he sank a good putt for his eight. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought Nicklaus had a good chance to win the Masters, Trevino 
slowly shook his head. "The way he's hitting the ball, he'll finish high, but I 
don't think he can beat the juniors," he said. "He certainly will be more 
confident after this week." 
</P>
<P>
Crampton, Player and Phil Rodgers went into the last round two shots behind. 
Rodgers faded out quickly. He has not won a tournaments in 24 years. And, being 
paired with two of the sport's greats, Nicklaus and Player, probably was too 
much to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Crampton, thanks to a lucky bounce on his approach at one and a 35-foot putt on 
two, caught up by the fourth hole. But the 358-yard sixth did him in, too. His 
approach was in the rocks on the left and he doubled-bogeyed. 
</P>
<P>
Player, just missing on several putts, was within a shot when Nicklaus bogeyed 
No. 4. But he couldn't cope with the relentless, determined drive of Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus became the fourth player in the history of the young tour for old 
golfers to win first time out. Arnold Palmer did it in 1980, Player in 1985 and 
George Archer last year. "I really enjoyed the way I was treated and I'm going 
to play often on this tour," Nicklaus said. "As for Augusta, I think I'm ready 
for it. This is a good course to prepare for the Masters." 
</P>
<P>
Player, who was in the Nicklaus trio the last two rounds, likes Nicklaus' 
chances next week. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first place," Player said, "no matter what anyone else says, Jack is 
the greatest golfer that ever lived. Augusta has the same kind of shallow 
greens. He's hitting the ball great and today, he putted brilliantly. He didn't 
win all that easily. I had several chances. On 11 I had a chance to cut the 
lead to two shots. But I missed a 12-footer for birdie and Jack rammed in a 
downhill 10-footer to save par." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the 50-and-older set, Nicklaus rapped it as being good for 
marginal players he used to beat on the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
After his first tournament, he felt differently. "I feel real good about the 
way I was treated. I really enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
Some seniors were upset about Nicklaus' earlier remarks. But, as the great 
pitcher Dizzy Dean said, "It ain't bragging if you go out and do it." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer, trying to shake a slump, shot a 78 and finished at 229. He said 
next week at the Masters was when he wanted to emerge. Palmer might have to 
skip several tournaments if a lawsuit involving one of the courses he built 
goes to trial in Orlando. "They claim it could last up to six weeks," he said. 
. . . Barbara Nicklaus walked quietly and largely unnoticed around the course 
following her husband, Jack. She was wearing a white pullover sweater with a 
big Jack of Hearts playing card emblem across the front. 
</P>
<P>
The past two days there were pickets outside the entrance to the course 
protesting the use of too much water at the complex. Desert Mountain has signs 
warning that reclaimed water is used to water greens and fairways. . . . 
Defending champion Don Bies was never a threat. He shot a 72 on the final round 
and finished at 220.

THIS TIME, BICHETTE VOWS TO OUTLAST SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The towels spread out on the hill behind the left-field fence might have had 
bull's-eyes printed on them, so accurately did Dante Bichette hit the terry 
cloth targets. 
</P>
<P>
Blast after blast came off his bat and traveled 350 feet or more, scattering 
the fans who had gathered to soak up the sun and watch the Angels take batting 
practice Sunday. All they saw was the results of the winter weightlifting 
program that added nine pounds to the 26-year-old outfielder's already muscular 
frame. They didn't know that his display had as much to do with muscular 
strength as with mental strength, the assurance he has been gaining as spring 
training goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette was the sensation of spring training a year ago, when he batted .388 
with a club-leading four home runs and 17 runs batted in. He was in the 
starting lineup in right field on opening day, and for the first month he 
maintained his spring pace. He was hitting .324 (11 for 34) with five RBIs on 
April 27, but in his next 50 at-bats he had only seven hits. By June 19, he was 
demoted to triple-A Edmonton, where he remained until Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't playing every day. I never had to come off the bench and pinch-hit 
before," said the 6-foot-3, 212-pound Floridian. "Of course, you don't make it 
in the minors doing that, so I had no experience, and I found it difficult to 
do. I was disappointed when I went down, but I got it together and came back in 
September." 
</P>
<P>
He came back to training camp this year determined to prove that his 
performance last spring is the true indication of his talent, and he has almost 
certainly earned a spot on the 24-player roster as the fourth outfielder. After 
going one for two Sunday with an RBI-single in the Angels' 12-4 victory over 
the Milwaukee Brewers, Bichette is tied for the team lead with two home runs 
and is among the leaders with seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
He hit both home runs and drove in five runs Saturday against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had the flu ever since I've been here and that was the first day my 
energy was back to normal," Bichette said. 
</P>
<P>
His .267 batting average isn't as gaudy as the numbers he posted last spring, 
but he is better able to cope with the pressure he is sure to face once the 
season starts. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I didn't know what the big leagues were about and how I compared 
with big-league players, but this year I know I can play in the big leagues," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I came to camp in great shape, swinging the bat good, but this year 
I came in with the right mental attitude, and that's a big difference. Just 
getting a feeling for what the major leagues was has helped me. You think, 'The 
major leagues, wow,' if you don't know better, but they're just another bunch 
of humans, just at a different level." 
</P>
<P>
Having Manager Doug Rader show confidence in him also helped. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went down to Edmonton last year, I went to him and said, 'Thanks for 
the chance,' and he said, 'Don't thank me. You earned it,' " Bichette said. "He 
said he knew I'd be back. He's a motivator. He really inspires you." 
</P>
<P>
Rader believes Bichette can inspire the Angels' offense, which finished 12th in 
the American League in runs scored and 11th in team batting average last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to us that he does well and stays on the ballclub," Rader said. 
"Last year, he never really had an understanding of the nature of his swing. 
He's got all the natural ability in the world regarding his swing. But until 
this year, he had to have somebody with him to remind him. Not a whole lot for 
him was automatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the difficulty of being a big league player is learning how to use 
your ability. He's heading in the right direction. He's made a lot of 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
Enough to stay with the Angels all season? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they plan on me doing something to help the offense here, because I 
plan on doing something," Bichette said. "I can't really set goals yet because 
I don't know how much playing time I'm going to get, but I know I can help." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven gave up four hits and no runs in four innings and the Brewers' 
infield committed four of Milwaukee's five errors at Compadre Stadium in the 
Angels' Arizona exhibition finale. The Angels are 6-3 as they head to Palm 
Springs for a four-game series with the San Diego Padres, starting today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to getting the season started," said Blyleven, who made 67 
pitches Sunday and threw an extra inning in the bullpen after coming out. "With 
everything that's happened, the lockout, getting down here and all the 
traveling we've already done, it'll be nice to be home." 
</P>
<P>
Mark McLemore left the game as a precautionary measure after experiencing 
tightness in both hamstrings while rounding second base in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee General Manager Harry Dalton, after watching his team commit two 
errors in the first inning: "We've got the Venus de Milo infield. They all have 
only one arm." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley (on three days' rest), Rich Monteleone and Mike Smithson will 
pitch against the Padres today. Mark Langston and Mike Witt are scheduled to 
pitch Tuesday, Kirk McCaskill and Jim Abbott on Wednesday and Blyleven on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are batting .324 in exhibitions, but Rader refuses to get excited. 
The Angels batted .277 last spring but only .256 during the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember anything about our hitting from last spring. I can tell you 
about last summer," he said. "I can't tell you who won the Cactus League. I'm 
not saying I'm not pleased, but you need to treat it just as what it is. The 
thing I'm most pleased with is the approach and the rhythm that's been involved 
with the swings." 
</P>
<P>
Rader also said he was pleased with Abbott's four innings Saturday against the 
Indians after being concerned about the young left-hander's arm strength. "He 
threw breaking balls over the plate and change-ups over the plate. The guy has 
a very amazing aptitude. He wasn't able to get the ball inside to right-handed 
hitters, but he could very easily have gone a full stint." 
</P>
<P>
Monteleone has an 87.75 earned-run average after giving up 13 earned runs in 1 
1/3 innings. Scott Bailes, Mark Eichhorn, Finley and Bob McClure have yet to 
give up an earned run. 
</P>

Leading the hitters is Rick Schu, who was one for four Sunday and is six for 10

LAETTNER IS LIFE OF BLUE DEVILS' PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
DUKE: SPIRITED SOPHOMORE FORWARD HAS EMERGED AS LEADER OF TEAM'S DRIVE TO THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

<P>
After Duke lost to Seton Hall in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament last 
season, seniors Danny Ferry, Quin Snyder and John Smith implored their 
underclass teammates to bring the Blue Devils back to the Final Four for 
another shot at a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Laettner looked up and said, "OK, I'll try." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in large part to Laettner's efforts -- and his ability to keep things 
simple -- the Blue Devils returned to the Final Four and will play Nevada Las 
Vegas in the championship game tonight at McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-11 sophomore from Angola, N.Y., is Duke's best all-around player, 
its leading rebounder and No. 2 scorer. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils' very life source, some have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, another group of Duke seniors -- teammates Alaa Abdelnaby, Robert 
Brickey and Phil Henderson -- made that very suggestion to Laettner only a few 
weeks ago, letting him know that he was letting them down. 
</P>
<P>
They told him that he wasn't playing with his usual panache and that his lack 
of verve was dragging them down. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's playing as well as he can play, a lot of enthusiasm comes out," 
Abdelnaby said. "We're used to that. We're accustomed to him, after a big play, 
waving his fist or yelling -- giving us the kind of intensity he's given us for 
two years. So, we're very aware of when it's not there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to the point now where we're so reliant on it that when it's not there, 
it's draining for the rest of the guys because we're thinking in the backs of 
our minds, 'What's wrong with Christian?' " 
</P>
<P>
Laettner was unaware that he was causing such havoc. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what was expected of me in terms of scoring, rebounding and defense," 
said Laettner, who averages 16.3 points and 9.6 rebounds and tonight will guard 
Larry Johnson, UNLV's All-American forward. "One thing I didn't know was how I 
affect my teammates by the way I act. 
</P>
<P>
"My teammates told me, 'Christian, we need you to act a certain way, and that 
way is emotional and upbeat and having a lot of fun.' (Toward) the end of the 
regular season, I wasn't acting like that. I was quiet and kind of mean to my 
teammates on the court, and they didn't appreciate that at all." 
</P>
<P>
Mean? 
</P>
<P>
"I was being selfish," he said. "I wasn't giving my teammates what I can give 
them. What they need from me, what they want from me, is life." 
</P>
<P>
Laettner has provided it in Duke's past three games. 
</P>
<P>
After making only one of 11 shots in the Blue Devils' victories over Richmond 
and St. John's in the first two rounds of the tournament, he hammered UCLA 
inside and out for 24 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Against Connecticut in the East Regional final, he scored 23 points, including 
two at the buzzer on a double-pumping shot from the left of the free throw line 
that gave the Blue Devils a 79-78 victory. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates promptly dog-piled the giddy Laettner. 
</P>
<P>
"But I pushed them off," said the East Regional's most valuable player. "I 
wanted to get that feeling of them jumping on me again." 
</P>
<P>
Against Arkansas Saturday in the semifinals, Laettner provided 19 points, 14 
rebounds and a few anxious moments for Coach Mike Krzyzewski, who sensed the 
game slipping away from the Blue Devils when Laettner picked up his fourth foul 
with 13:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Laettner returned after only three minutes on the bench and helped the Blue 
Devils overcome a seven-point deficit to win, 97-83. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a special player," Krzyzewski said. "His ability to think on the court is 
outstanding and when he's in a situation like that, I have confidence that if 
he does get his fifth, it will be an unusual situation." 
</P>
<P>
The graceful Laettner was heavily recruited out of The Nichols School in 
Buffalo, N.Y., narrowing his college choices to North Carolina, Virginia and 
Duke, but not even Krzyzewski expected so much so soon. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner emerged as an impact player late last season, although he gained 
probably his greatest notoriety by missing a free throw with one second left in 
a 77-75 loss to Arizona at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
It was widely reported that the freshman was consoled afterward by former 
President Richard Nixon, an alumnus of the Duke law school. 
</P>
<P>
But Laettner seemed to get more of a kick out of the response from a fan in 
South Carolina, who declared in a letter mailed to Laettner that Feb. 26 would 
henceforth be known as National Brick Day in honor of Laettner's missed free 
throw and also wrote of Laettner, "You're the sorriest excuse for a basketball 
player I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Laettner was so amused that he pinned the letter to his door for several weeks 
so that his friends could come by and read it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very funny and very ridiculous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Laettner's mind, he had played well against Arizona, scoring 12 points, 
grabbing 10 rebounds and making all six of his shots from the field. Laettner 
continued his strong play through eight postseason games, averaging 13.1 points 
and 5.8 rebounds and making 74.5% of his shots in the Atlantic Coast Conference 
and NCAA tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
He was especially productive against Georgetown in the East Regional final, 
scoring 24 points on nine-of-10 shooting and taking nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me a lot of confidence because it showed me that if I play more than 
15 minutes a game, I can give the team a lot," Laettner said of his emergence 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
In Ferry's absence, Laettner has continued to blossom this season, but his role 
has changed dramatically. "Last year," he said, "my role was to play real good 
defense, rebound, give some life to the team and help Danny get open. Then, 
once we got the ball to him, it was my job to get myself open so that, if he 
had two or three guys on him, he could pass to me under the basket." 
</P>
<P>
Taking mostly layups, Laettner made 72.3% of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
More of a focal point this season, he has made only 51.3% of his shots, but as 
he showed against Connecticut, he has increased his range. He also has been 
fouled more often and has made 83.6% of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
But Laettner is his own worst critic, according to his teammates, and when he 
got down on himself this season, his enthusiasm waned. 
</P>
<P>
It took their criticism to bring him out of his funk. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't having fun on the court," Laettner said of a February slump in which 
he scored only 18 points in three games. "It might have been (a lack of) 
self-confidence, but I might have just been tired. And maybe now I've caught my 
second wind." 
</P>
<P>
It has blown Duke all the way through the NCAA tournament.

HUNT KEEPS REBELS ON A STEADY COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
UNLV: VERSATILE GUARD HAS PROVED THAT HE IS MORE THAN MERELY A PROFICIENT 
THREE-POINT SHOOTER.

<P>
The Nevada Las Vegas basketball team was flying home from a game when the plane 
plunged 8,000 feet after losing hydraulic power. Most of the players were 
terrified until the plane landed safely. 
</P>
<P>
But UNLV guard Anderson Hunt slept through the crisis. How could that be? 
</P>
<P>
"I was dreaming of Las Vegas showgirls," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1 sophomore guard has been a calming influence on the Runnin' 
Rebels, maintaining his composure under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas' most accurate three-point shooter, Hunt made five three-point shots 
and scored 20 points as UNLV rallied to defeat Georgia Tech, 90-81, in an NCAA 
semifinal game Saturday to advance to the championship game against Duke 
tonight at McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Anderson has been a real key for us because he's our best outside shooter," 
Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "When Anderson is shooting real well, we generally 
play real well." 
</P>
<P>
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski is concerned about stopping Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"When he starts hitting, it's usually two three-pointers in a row and that 
seems to take their team to a different level," Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have an awareness of Hunt all the time because he may not be 
scoring, but he's their main guy. And he doesn't seem to get down when he 
misses a shot, which is a good quality to have when you're a shooter." 
</P>
<P>
A streak shooter, Hunt is averaging 15.4 points. Although he has made 47.2% of 
his shots -- 37.2% from three-point range -- he has been inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
After making a three-point shot to lift the Rebels to a 68-67 victory over 
Arizona, then the nation's top-ranked team, in the 1989 West Regional, Hunt 
missed 11 of 12 shots in his next game as UNLV was eliminated by Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt started slowly in the 1990 NCAA tournament, scoring only 24 points in 
UNLV's first three games before getting 30 points in a 30-point victory over 
Loyola Marymount in the West Regionalfinal. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's teammates maintain that he is a vital part of UNLV's offense because 
opponents must defend against his perimeter shooting and can't concentrate on 
stopping UNLV's strong inside game. 
</P>
<P>
"Anderson has been very important to us because he's shot tremendously well the 
entire season," guard Greg Anthony said. "Just the threat of having him out 
there is a big part of our offense. The great thing about him is that he can 
penetrate and guys can't slough off because if he's open for a moment he can 
hit the three." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt wasn't hitting in the first half against Georgia Tech, missing three of 
five three-point shots as the Rebels fell behind by seven points at halftime. 
But he sank three of four three-point shots in the second half. With UNLV 
leading, 76-74, Hunt made two consecutive three-point shots to help the Rebels 
take command of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Hunt's unpredictable," said Duke guard Phil Henderson, who will guard him 
tonight. "Huntcan light it up for 30 one game and do nothing the next game." 
</P>
<P>
Even when he's not shooting well, Hunt said Tarkanian doesn't lose confidence 
in him. 
</P>
<P>
"In most programs around the country they'll tell you to stop shooting," Hunt 
said. "But it's not like that at Vegas. Coach tells me to keep shooting and my 
teammates tell me to keep shooting. I'm going to shoot whether they go in or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Although he's recognized as for his offense, Hunt is also a strong defensive 
player. Henderson marveled at Hunt's shot-blocking ability. 
</P>
<P>
"We've watched some UNLV games where he's gone up and goaltended some shots 
that a center should goaltend," Henderson said. "He's really a great athlete." 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit high school basketball player of the year in 1987, Hunt averaged 22 
points, seven assists, five steals and four rebounds as a senior at 
Southwestern High, which won its first 27 games before losing in the state 
final to Cooley High of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Coach Perry Watson isn't surprised that that Hunt has become a 
good college player. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a tremendous competitor in high school," Watson said. "When he was 
playing in high school we didn't have the three-point shot. But I think he's 
starting to show the total game that he did in high school. He can penetrate 
and dish and shoot it and play defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year they tried to label him as just a three-point shooter, but I think 
this year he's shown the variety of things he can do on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The runner-up to Temple guard Mark Macon, who attended Buena Vista High in 
Saginaw, as Michigan's Mr. Basketball, Hunt had no interest in attending 
Michigan or Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw Vegas was when they played Georgetown on TV," Hunt said. 
"My mother didn't want me to watch the game because I had school the next day 
but I stayed up late and watched anyway. I knew that I wanted to go to Vegas 
after that. I liked their fans and the way they ran and played defense. Coach 
Tark let the players do what they wanted as long as they played hard and played 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt had to sit out his first season at Las Vegas because he was academically 
ineligible under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of tough sitting out my first year," Hunt said. "But I learned 
that you had to focus on your books as well as basketball." 
</P>
<P>
The one-year layoff didn't hurt Hunt, who averaged 12 points, 3.6 assists ans 
1.7 rebounds after he became eligible last season. 
</P>
<P>
After he moved into the starting lineup at shooting guard, UNLV won 12 of its 
final 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Most guys who have to sit out just sit around the house feeling sorry for 
themselves not working out and getting fat," Hunt said. "But I was working on 
my shot and lifting weights." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt has continued to improve this season as UNLV has won 34 of 39 games to 
reach the final.

KRUGER LEAVES KANSAS STATE TO COACH AT FLORIDA; 
</P>
<P>
COACHES: RUDY WASHINGTON, EX-USC ASSISTANT, TAKES JOB AT DRAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After coaching his alma mater, Kansas State, to the NCAA tournament in each of 
his four years there, Lon Kruger accepted the head job at scandal-rocked 
Florida Sunday. Also, Rudy Washington, a former assistant at USC and 
administrative aide with the Lakers, accepted the head coaching job at Drake. 
</P>
<P>
In hiring Kruger, Florida Athletic Director Bill Arnsparger ended a months-long 
search for a permanent replacement for Norm Sloan. Sloan resigned under 
pressure, and interim Coach Don DeVoe finished off a losing season. 
</P>
<P>
Kruger's four-year record at Kansas State was 81-46, including a 20-11 record 
his first year that took K-State to the NCAA tournament for the first time 
since 1982. His second Wildcat team in 1987-88 ranks as one of the school's 
all-time best, at 25-9 tying the school record for most victories in a season. 
It came within one game of reaching the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
Kruger was the first coach in school history to lead the Wildcats to four 
consecutive NCAA postseason appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"His name has appeared among the list of the nation's top coaches for the last 
several years," Arnsparger said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, an Iowa assistant coach, pledged to heal Drake's "fragile" 
basketball program at his Sunday announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've waited 15 years for this opportunity," said Washington, 38. He was head 
coach at Verbum Dei High School and Compton Junior College in 1984-85 and 
assistant at USC from 1977-83. He was an administrative assistant with the 
Lakers in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
Washington takes over a program that was shredded midway through the Missouri 
Valley Conference season when all of the players boycotted practice, saying 
former Coach Tom Abatemarco verbally abused them, and that they would not play 
while he was coach. Abatemarco resigned in February after being "reassigned" to 
other duties by Drake president Michael Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
Washington said he was confident he would be supported by the administration: 
"They (Ferrari and Athletic Director Curtis Blake) said they would support me 
all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Washington is president of the Black Coaches Assn., but he said bylaws require 
him to resign now that he is a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his race probably held him back in his effort to become a head 
coach -- he applied at Drake but was not even interviewed two years ago when 
Abatemarco got the job -- and he agreed that black coaches are stereotyped as 
good recruiters but not necessarily good leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a stigma that minority coaches deal with," he said. "Initially, when 
basketball started taking on blacks, they wanted blacks to do recruiting. It 
was frustrating."

R. Dee Hubbard's Southland-based Survive ran a mile in stakes record time, 
carrying Jose Santos to a three-length victory Sunday in the $114,400 Bed o' 
Roses Handicap at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying 117 pounds in the race for fillies and mares 3 years old and older, 
Survive ended Amy Be Good's five-race winning streak. Amy Be Good was second in 
the six-horse field, 4 1/2 lengths ahead of Warfie. 
</P>
<P>
Survive's time of 1:34 1/5 bettered by four-fifths of a second the record set 
by Too Bald in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the first in four starts this year for favored Survive, who 
earned $68,640 and returned $5.20, $3.60 and $2.40. Amy Be Good paid $3.40 and 
$2.60 and Warfie was $4.20. 
</P>
<P>
Train Robbery, ridden by Pat Day, went past Mercedes Miss in the deep stretch 
to score a neck victory over Silvered in a three-horse photo in the $75,000 
Honeybee Stakes at Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-race favorite, unbeaten Classy Irene, was scratched early in the day 
because of a bruise above the hoof on his right hind leg. That scratch enabled 
the connections of Train Robbery to hire Day, the leading rider at Oaklawn. 
Classy Irene had won six consecutive races. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by the Overbrook Farm and trained by Wayne Lukas, Train Robbery paid 
$4.80 and $4.80. Silvered returned $8.20. There was no show wagering in the 
four-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Train Robbery, fresh from a victory in the Remington Oaks, was the second 
choice in the wagering. Timber Ribbon, the favorite, wound up fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Train Robbery completed the 1 1/16 mile race in 1:45 3/5. The Honeybee is a 
major prep for the $250,000 Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
Train Robbery won despite carrying top weight of 122 pounds, 10 pounds more 
than each of her three opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Train Robbery earned $45,000 to push her career earnings past $120,000. She has 
four firsts and two seconds in nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
Tower Above 'Em rallied in the stretch to beat 11 older horses in the $100,000 
Week of Fame Gold Cup at the Fair Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in his last four races that Tower Above 'Em used a late 
stretch drive to win. He was seventh at the turn for home and beat Allijeba by 
1 3/4 lengths. The 6-year-old Irish Tower gelding returned $23.40, $9.40 and 
$5.60. 
</P>
<P>
Libor came from far back to upset Dawn Quixote, the odds-on favorite, in the 
$50,000 Golden Beach Handicap for 3-year-olds on the grass at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
Libor won the 1 1/16-mile race by half a length as Dawn Quixote edged Duke's 
Cup by a nose for second. Libor paid $18, $4.60 and $2.40.

RUHLMANN IS THE RIGHT HORSE AT RIGHT TIME; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANITA: ON A SPEED-FAVORING TRACK, HE GOES WIRE-TO-WIRE TO WIN THE SAN 
BERNARDINO HANDICAP.

<P>
From sunup to sundown, Sunday was Gary Stevens' kind of day. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Stevens was out to work Mister Frisky, the Santa Anita Derby 
favorite who went through his last serious exercise in preparation for next 
Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, who will put his unbeaten, 15-race record on the line, worked 
five furlongs in an official 1:00, although trainer Laz Barrera and some other 
clockers caught him going slightly faster. Only two horses on the work tab 
turned in times faster than 1:00 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Stevens won three early races and then capped the day with a 
two-length victory aboard Ruhlmann in the $420,800 San Bernardino Handicap. The 
1 1/8-mile race was Stevens' 11th stakes victory of the meeting, the same total 
as Chris McCarron, and Stevens has 94 winners overall, which gives him an 
18-victory lead over McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky and Ruhlmann run alike -- they go to the lead and challenge the 
others to catch them. After Annual Date made only a swipe at staying with 
Ruhlmann early, Criminal Type put in a modest run through the stretch. But he 
was no match for the winner, who is the right horse at the right time at 
speed-favoring Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type finished 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Stylish Winner, who was 
three-quarters of a length ahead of Lively One. Annual Date wound up fifth and 
Payant was last from start to finish. Ruhlmann, earning $240,800 for Jerry and 
Ann Moss and increasing his total to $1.5 million, was timed in 1:47 1/5, the 
same clocking he had in winning the stake a year ago. Only one other horse -- 
Terrang in 1958-59 -- has won the San Bernardino in successive years. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, a 5-year-old son of Mr. Leader and Indian Maiden, beat Criminal Type 
by 1 3/4 lengths in the Santa Anita Handicap March 4. Criminal Type had won the 
San Antonio Handicap Feb. 11, when Ruhlmann was third. That time, Complicate 
prevented Ruhlmann from running untethered up front. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, favored by the crowd of 46,277 on Santa Anita's Latin Fiesta Day, 
paid $4.60 to win and gave trainer Charlie Whittingham his 11th victory in the 
San Bernardino. Whittingham also saddled Lively One and Payant. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ruhlmann runs on the lead with no pressure, he's always going to be 
tough," said Wayne Lukas, who trains Criminal Type. "Maybe he won't always have 
that advantage, which is especially favorable at this distance. You've got to 
have somebody go with him, and it would also help if they wrote the races 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who is leading the country in purses with more than $3.3 million, had 
a productive week, also throwing in a couple of three-victory days. 
</P>
<P>
"When he switched to his right lead (foot) turning into the stretch, he was 
long gone," Stevens said of Ruhlmann. "The only concern I had was warming up. 
He bit his tongue and had some blood coming out of his mouth. He wears a tongue 
tie and was on the muscle, chomping on the bit and grinding his teeth. But he 
went to the gate just right and was real settled." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann carried 123 pounds, four more than Criminal Type. Lukas replaced Alex 
Solis on Criminal Type with Laffit Pincay, who had ridden the horse five times 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"When Laffit elected to go outside on the far turn, he lost a little ground," 
Lukas said. "That may have been the difference. If he could have gotten into 
contention a little more at the eighth pole, it might have been closer." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay rode Ruhlmann to victory last year in the San Bernardino. "My horse 
tried all the way," he said Sunday. "(Eddie) Delahoussaye's horse (Annual Date) 
came in a little on the backside, and my horse got intimidated and wouldn't go 
up inside there. I had to go out and come around. I don't know if it would have 
made any difference, but I would have been closer. I still thought I had a 
chance at the top of the stretch, but the other horse didn't stop." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann races on Lasix, a diuretic that discourages bleeding. "He's a fast 
horse, and if we can keep him from bleeding, we'll be all right," Whittingham 
said. "The way my other horse (Lively One) ran today, I might have left it for 
Lukas to pick up the money." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham has designs on even bigger money for Ruhlmann, who probably will 
run in the Pimlico Special in Baltimore May 12. Once again, Ruhlmann may be the 
right horse for the right time. The Special's purse has been increased to $1 
million, and Pimlico can sometimes be a speed-favoring track, like Santa 
Anita's. 
</P>

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally doesn't know what to do. He will start Balla Cove in the 
Santa Anita Derby Saturday, but he's on the fence with Silver Ending and Single 
Dawn, two more of his 3-year-olds. "I was figuring on the Blue Grass (at 
Keeneland April 14) for Silver Ending, but that race is now coming up real 
tough," McAnally said. "But if I keep him here and run, there's a whole lot of 
speed in the race, and that won't help my horse, either." Silver Ending worked 
six furlongs Sunday in 1:11 1/5, the fastest time of the day, and Single Dawn 
was clocked in 1:12 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally probably won't make a decision on the Santa Anita Derby until entry 
time Thursday morning. . . . Definites for the race are Mister Frisky, Real 
Cash, Warcraft, Music Prospector, Video Ranger and Balla Cove. Possibilities 
are Single Dawn, Silver Ending, Assyrian Pirate, Farma Way and Robyn Dancer. . 
. . The Blue Grass will include Summer Squall, who beat another McAnally colt, 
Tight Spot, in the Jim Beam Saturday at Turfway Park; and Unbridled, who beat 
Single Dawn in the Florida Derby . . . Tight Spot, who faded from second to 
fifth in the Jim Beam, was examined after the race and was found to have bled 
from the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day confirmed that he will ride Summer Squall in the Blue Grass, which 
leaves Unbridled to be ridden by Craig Perret. . . . There was no swelling in 
the leg where Summer Squall was kicked by an outrider's pony minutes after his 
victory Saturday. It required two stitches to close a superficial cut. . . . 
Wayne Lukas said that Land Rush will run in either the Blue Grass or the 
Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park April 21. 
</P>
<P>
The same syndicate that owns Summer Squall won Sunday's fourth race at Santa 
Anita with Hitchcock Woods. . . . Survive, trained by Dick Mandella, is winless 
in three Santa Anita starts this year, but he won Sunday's $100,000 Bed o' 
Roses Handicap at Aqueduct. Ridden by Jose Santos, Survive ran a mile in 1:34 
1/5 on a track listed as good to tie the stakes record. . . . Claire Marine, 
who finished second to Brown Bess in the Eclipse Awards voting for best female 
turf horse last year, has been retired and probably will be bred to Alydar.

PADILLA STILL HAS TALENT BUT LACKS AN EVENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Padilla is an accomplished runner who is particularly suited for either 
3,000 meters or two miles. 
</P>
<P>
However, he's a man without an event in the Olympic Games, World Championships, 
or even in the The Athletic Congress meet, the U.S. outdoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
"So I have to go up to 5,000, but in the past, I haven't had the strength for 
that distance," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is he quite fast enough to be a world-class contender in the mile or 1,500 
meters, even though he had a personal best mile time of three minutes, 54.2 
seconds in last year's Jack in the Box Invitational at Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
However, Padilla finds his niche on the indoor circuit, where the 3,000 or two 
miles is sometimes part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
He set an American record for two miles of 8:52.09 seconds last February in The 
Times/Eagle indoor games at the Forum, breaking his own record. 
</P>
<P>
He has also recorded the fastest 3,000 outdoor time by an American, 7:35.84 in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Someone suggested that he should try the steeplechase, a recognized 
international event, which is contested over 3,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, but they put those little problems in there," he said dryly, referring 
to the barriers and water jump in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, who competed for Brigham Young, is youthful looking at 33. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to compete through the 1992 season now that he's reasonably healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, who lives in Orem, Utah, has suffered from asthma and allergies since 
he was 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I had taken everything there is to try for allergy and asthma treatment," 
Padilla said resignedly. 
</P>
<P>
So, two years ago he sought relief in homeopathy, and he says he's healthier 
than he has been since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Homeopathy is a medical specialty based on the principle that "like cures 
like." 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary definition: "The theory, or system of curing diseases with very 
minute doses of medicine, which in a healthy person and in large doses would 
produce a condition like that of the disease treated." 
</P>
<P>
Unclear? Let Padilla try to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"Homeopathy has a belief that anything that does harm to the body, if diluted 
to a sufficient point, there is a dilution where it will be a benefit to you. 
</P>
<P>
"Standard medicine maintains it's just a placebo." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Padilla told Track &amp; Field News: "The idea behind homeopathy is that 
for everything that can be a detriment to you, there's another concentration 
that can be a benefit. It's kind of along the line of a vaccination." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Padilla said he was constantly tired from standard allergy 
injections, adding that he hasn't had any side effects from homeopathic 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
So, while near the end of his career, Padilla is looking forward to career-best 
performances, such as another fast mile time May 20 in the Drake Stadium 
invitational meet. 
</P>
<P>
Pollen -- more than people -- has been his most constant adversary. 
</P>
<P>
It has been difficult to get excited about the javelin since it was redesigned 
in 1986, changing the center of gravity, so it wouldn't soar as far as the old 
model. 
</P>
<P>
One would yawn at throws of 280 feet, remembering that East Germany's Uwe Hohn 
held the world record with the old javelin at 343 feet 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
However, Texas sophomore Patrik Boden is reviving some interest in the event, 
threatening to break the revised 300-foot barrier with the new javelin. 
</P>
<P>
He set a world record of 292-4 March 24, breaking the previous record of 287-7 
held by Jan Zelezny of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Boden, a native of Sweden, warmed up for his record performance with a throw of 
271-7 in a triangular meet at UCLA March 17. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unrealistic," said the 22-year-old Boden of his throw. "I had no idea I 
was going to throw this far. This is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shotputter's nightmare," UCLA's Brian Blutreich said. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't referring to dropping the 16-pound ball on his foot, or tearing a 
muscle as he spins around the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Hand injuries are a shotputter's nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich tore ligaments in his throwing hand in 1986 and reinjured it in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a look at the human hand. There isn't much supporting it," said 
Blutreich. "You have guys who weigh 290 or 300 pounds who are very explosive, 
like Randy Barnes. Hundreds of pounds of pressure are going on the hand, and 
the hand isn't meant for that." 
</P>
<P>
International Amateur Athletic Federation rules prohibit shotputters from 
taping their hands, a ruling that bothers weightmen since jumpers and sprinters 
are allowed to tape their ankles. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Steve Lewis pulled up at the 250-meter mark of his 400-meter race 
Saturday in a dual meet with California at Drake Stadium. Lewis, the Olympic 
gold medalist in the 400 at Seoul in 1988, reinjured his right hamstring. It 
was the same injury that prevented him from competing in the NCAA meet last 
year. However, UCLA sprint coach John Smith, a former world-class 
quarter-miler, says the injury isn't serious. "He just tore some scar tissue, 
which is normal," Smith said. "I don't think he'll be out for more than a 
couple of weeks." . . . USC's 400 and 1,600-meter relays teams were 
disqualified after winning at the Stanford Invitational Saturday for passing 
out of the zone. 
</P>
<P>
USC track Coach Ernie Bullard says the Pacific 10 is proposing to reduce 
scholarships by 10% in non-revenue sports. Football and basketball wouldn't be 
affected, of course. As it is, there are only 14 scholarships available for 21 
events in men's track. Conversely, women are granted 16 scholarships for 17 
events . . . Hurdler Greg Foster suffered a foot injury during the indoor 
season, but it's not as serious as first reported and he's already training for 
the major meets in the outdoor season.

NEWSWIRE: CARBAJAL IS FORCED TO GO THE DISTANCE, BUT SCORES VICTORY OVER ACOSTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olympic silver medalist Michael Carbajal tuned up for next month's 
International Boxing Federation junior flyweight title challenge with a tough 
10-round decision Sunday over scrappy Raul Acosta at Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal (13-0, seven knockouts) won all 10 rounds on two judges' cards. Judge 
Doug Tucker gave Acosta one round. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Carbajal used a four-inch height advantage and an extra 4 1/2 
inches of reach to sting Acosta to the body and head, staggering the Mexico 
City fighter several times in the middle and late rounds. Neither boxer went 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal, the North American Boxing Federation flyweight champion, will 
challenge IBF junior flyweight titleholder Muangshai Kittikasem of Thailand for 
his belt May 13 at Atlantic City.

EXECUTIONS: WHO DIES AND WHY?; 
</P>
<P>
DISCRETIONARY JUDGMENTS AFFECT THE WAY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT LAWS ARE IMPOSED 
STATE TO STATE AND COUNTY TO COUNTY. INCONSISTENCIES ABOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In striking down capital punishment laws as unconstitutionally cruel and 
unusual 18 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the statutes were being 
arbitrarily and capriciously enforced. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, only one in 100 killers was -- and still is -- being 
chosen to die. 
</P>
<P>
For the late Justice Potter Stewart, figuring out which one was about as easy 
as predicting who was going to be "struck by lightning." 
</P>
<P>
But the court refused to endorse state laws that would have solved the problem 
by rigidly requiring that all killers who acted with premeditation be put to 
death. Instead, it backed laws that left room for mercy and provided only vague 
guidelines for prosecutors and jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Discretionary moral judgments have remained at the core of the Death Row 
selection system and have led to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies have 
been viewed by death penalty supporters as inevitable and tolerable, and 
compared by opponents to a "cruel lottery" or "crap shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Anecdotes abound of killers in California and elsewhere who have committed 
horrible crimes and been sentenced to life imprisonment, while others who have 
committed arguably less horrible crimes have been sentenced to die. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono, who was convicted of 
kidnaping, torturing and killing nine young women, and given a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Then consider Robert Alton Harris, who kidnaped and shot to death two teen-age 
boys, and may become the first person executed in California in 23 years. A 
federal judge has stayed Harris' execution indefinitely, but the state has 
asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the execution to go ahead as scheduled on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Who was worse -- Buono or Harris? 
</P>
<P>
Harris, at one point, raised such a question in an unsuccessful appeal to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, asking that it order lower courts to systematically compare 
the cases of those who were sentenced to die to the cases of those who were 
not. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court declined, declaring in 1984 that "any capital sentencing 
scheme may occasionally produce aberrational outcomes. Such inconsistencies are 
a far cry from . . . major systemic defects." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court was not unanimous in its decision, however. Justice William 
Brennan, a death penalty foe, said the court was "simply deluding itself." He 
said the death penalty was being administered in as arbitrary a fashion as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
But some death penalty advocates say "So what?" They argue that it is 
irrelevant if some murderers happen to get a break and are spared death. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan said the gravest inequity was racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of Harris' challenge, the court had already struck down the chief 
instrument of this kind of discrimination -- laws of some Southern states that 
permitted the death penalty for rape and which were overwhelmingly applied to 
black men in rapes of white women. 
</P>
<P>
But a report released in February by the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, showed that discrimination persists. The GAO 
reviewed 28 academic studies, conducted in different parts of the country from 
1972 to 1988, and found "a pattern of evidence indicating racial disparities in 
the charging, sentencing and imposition of the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the studies, the GAO said, found that "those who murdered whites 
were . . . more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered blacks. 
This finding was remarkably consistent . . . across states." 
</P>
<P>
One of the few studies the GAO considered that did not find racial disparities 
applied to California and was conducted by RAND Corp. researchers working under 
contract to state and county prosecutors. "It may be that California is 
somewhat different than other places," said research psychologist Stephen 
Klein, one of the RAND study's authors. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, researchers say, there are about 20,000 killings a year in the United 
States, about 10,000 convictions and 300 sentences of death. Not all states 
have capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The death penalty is reserved for certain types of killers -- generally those 
who kill on purpose and under "special circumstances," such as for financial 
gain, or while lying in wait, or during the course of a robbery, burglary or 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the death penalty could be applied much more often than it is. 
</P>
<P>
In robberies where murders occur, for example, there is often more than one 
criminal involved and thus more than one person who may be eligible for the 
death penalty. But for a prosecutor, "what's important is that you score one 
touchdown" in the form of a death sentence, said Franklin R. Zimring, UC 
Berkeley law professor and a capital punishment expert. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, a race ensues in which the robbers try to be the first to point the 
finger at an accomplice and make a deal with the prosecutor to testify in 
return for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Zimring said, it never becomes clear whether the person who got 
leniency or the person on trial for his life actually pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Zimring said 80% of all killings involve acquaintances or intimates, but that 
the 20% involving strangers tend to dominate the nation's Death Rows. 
</P>
<P>
He said that characteristic reflects society's greater fears of strangers: "If 
a guy gets killed by his wife, we're not worried, because we're not married to 
his wife." 
</P>
<P>
In California, as in most of the 37 states that now have the death penalty, 
district attorneys have virtually unfettered discretion in deciding whether to 
charge a first-degree murder defendant with one of the 19 "special 
circumstances" that is almost certain to apply to his case. These special 
circumstances would make him eligible for the death penalty or life in prison 
without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors say they are reluctant to overdo it. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Asst. Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay decides who is charged with 
special-circumstances offenses. He said his office files murder or manslaughter 
charges in about 1,200 killings a year, but most of these are "at the low end 
-- friends killing friends or relatives killing each other." 
</P>
<P>
In 13 years, Livesay said, his office has filed only 1,200 special-circumstance 
murder cases, pursued only 600 of those, sought the death penalty, as opposed 
to life without parole, in 240 of those, and persuaded juries to impose a death 
sentence in only 80 cases.

Livesay, who said that his own deliberations are complex, described one simple 
rule of thumb: If a 19-year-old with no previous record robs a liquor store, 
struggles with the proprietor and kills him, perhaps because the teen-ager's 
gun discharged accidentally, it is probably not a death penalty case. On the 
other hand, if the 19-year-old robber had an extensive criminal record, had the 
proprietor kneel and then shot him in the head, it probably would be a death 
penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Los Angeles County it is typically the elected district attorney, 
rather than one of his assistants, who makes the final decision, and standards 
differ widely from county to county, according to California Supreme Court 
Justice Allen E. Broussard. 
</P>
<P>
In upholding the death sentence in a Tuolomne County case of a 20-year-old who 
shot a fisherman in the back of the head while robbing him, Broussard warned of 
a problem. "We have in effect 58 death penalty laws," or one for each county, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the guidelines established in most of the urban counties, (this) murder 
. . . would not have been prosecuted as a capital case," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
A Death Row inmate from Merced County has based his pending appeal to the 
California Supreme Court in part on a survey of scores of arguably more 
horrible cases in which murderers were sentenced to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
California is not alone in having difficulty distinguishing which murderers 
should get life and which death. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Morris, a death penalty advocate and member of the Georgia Board of 
Pardons and Paroles, spoke of the problem in a 1987 interview with the Atlanta 
Constitution. "Any rational, reasonable person," he said, "ought to be able to 
take 100 life and 100 death cases and shuffle them, and come back and place 
those cases back in the category they originally came from. And I'm saying it 
can't be done. . . . When you look at death versus life cases, there's not a 
heck of a lot of difference in most of them." 
</P>
<P>
There are even more dramatic inconsistencies between states. The late John 
Kaplan, a Stanford University law professor, once observed that John 
Spenkellink, the first man to be put to death in Florida since that state 
resumed executions in the late 1970s, could have been convicted only of 
second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter had he been tried in California. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line point," said New York lawyer Ronald J. Tabak, a death penalty 
foe who chairs an American Bar Assn. committee on capital punishment, "is that 
your chances of getting selected for the death penalty depends to a large 
extent on who the prosecutor is, how close to the election the prosecutor is, 
how white or otherwise prominent your victim is, and a variety of other factors 
that don't have to do with how terrible you are, or how terrible your crime is, 
compared to other crimes." 
</P>
<P>
But Kate Canlis, director of the California Dist. Attys. Assn. said she is 
unsympathetic to that point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe standards vary greatly," she said. "All of the people who are 
tried as capital murderers are the worst of the worst," selected by prosecutors 
who "sort of know intuitively . . . who to single out." 
</P>
<P>
"I know the kind of case when I see it," she said, explaining that it generally 
involves a defendant with a violent history who deliberately chooses to kill in 
an especially "cold and callous" manner. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that prosecutors or juries have decided to show mercy and spare the 
lives of others convicted of similar crimes is irrelevant, she said. The 
relevant factor, she said, is whether the death penalty is a legally suitable 
punishment for any individual crime.

COLUMBIA SAVINGS LOSES $575 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE BEVERLY HILLS-BASED FIRM SAYS THE FIVE-MONTH LOSS HAS RENDERED IT 
INSOLVENT. THE INSTITUTION'S ABILITY TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT IS IN DOUBT.

<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, the maverick Beverly Hills-based financial 
institution whose advertisements once boasted how safe and well-run it was, 
announced Sunday that it suffered losses of about $575 million in a recent 
five-month period that wiped out its capital and rendered it insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning announcement raises serious questions about Columbia Savings' 
ability to survive as an independent, stockholder-owned financial institution. 
Other large California thrifts in similarly dire conditions have been taken 
over by the government recently and are being operated by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings has $7.77 billion in deposits and 29 offices throughout 
Southern California, many in high-income areas like Beverly Hills and Newport 
Beach. All of its deposits will continue to be insured by the government up to 
$100,000, meaning that insured depositors need not panic and withdraw funds for 
fear of losing their savings. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia reported Sunday that its losses included almost $200 million in the 
first two months of 1990 and $379 million for the final three months of last 
year. The thrift's loss for all of 1989 totaled $591 million. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia blamed its losses largely on write-offs and credit deterioration in 
its junk bond portfolio and added that the red ink would have been worse had 
the firm not realized profits of more than $200 million by selling assets, 
including stocks and mortgage-backed securities. The company's real estate 
operations also lost $61.6 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Columbia Savings said in a statement that it will eventually be 
able to meet tougher capital requirements mandated by Congress last year as 
part of the massive taxpayer bailout of the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Columbia has the resources to reach full compliance with the 
capital standards mandated by Congress" by the Dec. 31, 1994, deadline, 
Columbia Savings Chief Executive Edward G. Harshfield said. He was not 
available for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Capital is the financial cushion of cash and other assets that financial 
institutions use to protect themselves against heavy losses. Until recently, 
Columbia was one of the best capitalized large thrifts in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's shareholders' equity, meaning its value to its stockholders, had 
fallen to a minus $121 million as of the end of February, "rendering it 
insolvent under generally accepted accounting principles," the company said. 
The company expects to report "significant" additional losses in March as part 
of its first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings had been expected to release its earnings Friday, but the news 
did not come until late Sunday afternoon. The delay reportedly resulted from a 
disagreement between the company and its outside auditor, the accounting firm 
of Deloitte &amp; Touche, over the size of the write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings' fall from grace has been swift and stunning for the once 
high-flying firm that emerged from obscurity in the early 1980s, led by a Nazi 
death camp survivor, Abraham Spiegel, and his son, Thomas. The Spiegel family 
still has voting control of Columbia's stock, which is now worth slightly more 
than $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was once a national symbol of how a savings and loan could 
successfully adapt to the new age of deregulation when thrifts across the 
country -- and especially in California -- were given broad leeway in investing 
their depositors' money. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Spiegels' guidance, Columbia Savings became one of the 
fasting-growing -- and most profitable -- thrifts in the country by investing 
billions of dollars in junk bonds, which are high-risk securities issued by 
corporations with low credit ratings. Only a minor percentage of the deposits 
were invested in home mortgages, the traditional staple of the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Spiegel learned the high-yield securities business under the tutelage of 
junk bond king -- and close friend -- Michael Milken, whose former trading 
offices at Drexel Burnham Lambert were just a few blocks west on Wilshire 
Boulevard from Columbia's executive offices. 
</P>
<P>
At its zenith in the mid 1980s, Columbia Savings' annual earnings approached 
$200 million, while Thomas Spiegel rode high, befriending important 
politicians, traveling by corporate jet, and enjoying record compensation 
packages. One year he earned $9 million, the highest pay ever enjoyed by an 
S&amp;L executive. 
</P>
<P>
The first signs of serious trouble came in the fall of 1987, when Columbia 
posted heavy losses in the fourth quarter due to the stock market crash that 
October. Columbia was one of the few thrifts that invested heavily in the 
equities market, and it took a severe beating in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the news has been all bad as the market for junk bonds has collapsed 
and forced Columbia to recognize huge losses in its high-yield bond portfolio. 
Columbia's junk bonds make up the vast majority of its $3.38 billion in debt 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Spiegel resigned as chief executive earlier this year and the corporate 
jet has been sold. He was replaced by Harshfield, a former banker from 
Citicorp. Abraham Spiegel, now 83, remains chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement Sunday, Columbia noted that thrifts in its condition are 
prohibited from any new loans or investments without regulatory approval. The 
firm's lending activity is already limited to making only residential loans 
under $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Its statement also noted that federal law "provides that insolvency and unsafe 
and unsound conditions (for thrifts) . . . constitute grounds for receivership 
or conservatorship." In California, two large failing thrifts, Mercury Savings 
in Huntington Beach and Imperial Savings in San Diego, were taken over by 
banking regulators in recent months after suffering heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to return to financial health, Columbia said that it has filed a 
plan with banking regulators that calls for selling its high-yield securities, 
a program already under way. Columbia also said it wants to shrink its assets, 
which now stand at about $9.25 billion, and take profits of $150 million to 
$250 million by selling the rest of its equity securities.

SOVIETS SEND TANKS TO JOIN REINFORCED LITHUANIA UNITS 
</P>

Columns of armored vehicles rolled through the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius on 
Sunday, underscoring President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's warning that "grave 
consequences" will result if the Baltic republic does not annul its unilateral 
declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight armored personnel carriers, apparently part of military 
reinforcements for the Soviet army's garrison in Vilnius, arrived by train 
early Sunday and at mid-morning rumbled through the capital to a military 
compound near the center of the city, according to a Lithuanian government 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a squadron of light tanks belonging to a paratroop unit arrived and, 
after a swing through central Vilnius, also went to the compound, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, as many as 60 armored vehicles as well as support vehicles were 
reported to have been brought to Vilnius on Sunday in what appeared to be a 
significant military buildup there. Army engineers were finishing a helicopter 
landing pad near the city's airport, and military technicians were completing a 
new communications center. 
</P>
<P>
"Vilnius was as quiet and peaceful and pleasant as you could hope a city might 
be on a Sunday morning in spring," Aidas Palubinskas of Lithuania's Government 
Information Office said by telephone. "The only instability here is caused by 
these military movements. We understand that they are trying to frighten us and 
force us to yield." 
</P>
<P>
But the Lithuanian leadership, showing no willingness to back down despite this 
intensification of the prolonged "war of nerves" with Moscow, called for mass 
rallies in the capital and in the republic's other towns Wednesday to 
demonstrate continued determination to seek Lithuania's independence in the 
face of Gorbachev's ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that President Gorbachev does not hear the voices inviting the Soviet 
Union to begin negotiations with Lithuania," Vytautas Landsbergis, the 
Lithuanian president, said in a statement Sunday. "We have made this offer 
repeatedly, but our hand is repeatedly rejected. Now, Mr. Gorbachev has 
rejected our offer in a very harsh manner, and we are surprised by his threats. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that Gorbachev is asking "impossible things" in telling Lithuania to 
abrogate its declaration of independence and accept without qualification its 
status as a Soviet republic, Landsbergis said: "It cannot now be demanded that 
we annul what we bore in our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in appeals over the weekend to the Lithuanian Supreme Council, the 
republic's Parliament, and to the Lithuanian people, had called on them to end 
their secessionist drive and accept the Soviet constitution as the framework 
for discussing their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
"If the voice of reason is not heeded now, developments can have grave 
consequences for all of us," Gorbachev had said, alluding to the dangers that 
confront Lithuania and the Soviet Union as a whole if the republic pursues its 
present course. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president left the warning vague, saying only that the republic's 
drive for independence would prove to be "ruinous and could only lead to a dead 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis, replying Sunday evening on the Soviet Union's national nightly 
news program, said Gorbachev's statement had come as a shock. "I view it as a 
strange and virtually undisguised threat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Supreme Council is scheduled to consider Gorbachev's appeal this 
afternoon, and the republic's leadership met for more than six hours Sunday, 
first as the council's Presidium and then as Sajudis, the Lithuanian 
nationalist movement, to assess the political situation. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis said before the meetings that he would send Lithuania's negotiators 
back to Moscow today with the assignment of setting up a meeting with Soviet 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania is "ready to negotiate and discuss any questions with the Soviet 
Union -- except that of independence," said Kazimieras Motieka, a deputy prime 
minister and a Sajudis leader. 
</P>
<P>
Another Sajudis official commented: "We have only one card in our hands -- our 
declaration of independence. If we throw that away, we have thrown everything 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an article in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda on the new Soviet 
presidency as an institution noted that, for Gorbachev, "the knot (over 
Lithuania) is getting tighter every day." 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Lithuanian question' has become the first test for the president," Alexai 
Karpychev, a political commentator, wrote. "What will President Gorbachev do? 
This problem is of concern for politicians and diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
"The president is sending telegrams, and Landsbergis demonstratively denounces 
them because the president of a foreign state has no authority to issue orders 
on Lithuanian territory. . . . The West is discussing whether force can be 
used. Even in faraway Africa, where the paths of our foreign minister and the 
American secretary of state cross, the 'Lithuanian question' was under 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
The clear implication is that Gorbachev, in addition to his own strong personal 
feelings on Lithuanian secession, is under intense pressure from a dozen 
sources -- all the more so because it is seen as a crucial test of his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between the Lithuanian nationalists and the Soviet government 
are so great, however, that even the process of negotiation will require hard 
bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow contends that it "negotiates" only with foreign governments and will 
simply "discuss" issues with Lithuania, but Lithuania wants the recognition 
that "negotiates" would imply and, up to now, has insisted on such talks 
outside the framework of the Soviet laws and the country's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet constitution assures the 15 constituent republics the right to 
secede from the Soviet Union, but it offers no mechanism for doing so. 
Legislation is now under consideration that would establish such procedures, 
but the first drafts provide for extensive negotiations, a five-year "cooling 
off period" and finally a national veto over any secession. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania received further support on Sunday from Estonian and Latvian 
nationalists and from nationalist and radical groups in Moscow, across the 
Ukraine and in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian Popular Front, addressing the West, urged that political and 
economic pressure be put on the Soviet Union to negotiate with the Lithuanians. 
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to you not to leave the Baltic states at the mercy of the 
totalitarian superpower, the Soviet Union, which has never abandoned any 
territory that it has occupied," the Latvian group said. "We believe and hope 
that support for Gorbachev by the governments of the democratic states does not 
mean the betrayal of the Baltic states in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Western powers, many of which have never recognized the forced incorporation of 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940, have been hesitant 
to support Lithuanian independence out of concern that it would undermine 
Gorbachev and his reform policies.

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
VOTERS FAVOR EXECUTION BY NEARLY 4 TO 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The verdict of California voters is nearly 4 to 1 that the state should execute 
Robert Alton Harris, sentenced to die in San Quentin's gas chamber for killing 
two San Diego teen-agers, The Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' execution, which had been scheduled for 3 a.m Tuesday, was stayed 
indefinitely Friday by a federal appeals court judge to give lawyers for the 
Death Row inmate more time to challenge the competence of his trial 
psychiatrists. But lawyers for the state have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to 
lift the stay and allow the execution to go forward as planned. 
</P>
<P>
In the court of public opinion, the clear judgment is that Harris should die. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, in a survey ending last Wednesday night, asked a simple 
question that did not even refer to Harris' crime. It merely inquired of those 
interviewed whether they favored Harris' execution on Tuesday and noted that he 
would be the first to die in the gas chamber since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The response was: In favor of the execution 60%, opposed 16%, don't know 5%, 
"haven't heard enough to say" 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who already had served a prison term for beating a man to death, was 
sentenced to the gas chamber in 1979 for murdering two teen-age boys he had 
kidnaped while stealing a car to use in a bank holdup. 
</P>
<P>
The voters' verdict on his execution, as measured by The Times poll, reflected 
the public's strong, longstanding support for capital punishment, an attitude 
that was reaffirmed in this survey. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they generally favored or opposed the death penalty for convicted 
murderers, the voters' response was: In favor 78%, opposed 18%, not sure 4%. 
That is virtually identical to voter sentiments found by The Times poll in 1985 
and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest survey, The Times poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, interviewed 1,667 
registered voters by telephone for six days. The margin of error is three 
percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
People also were asked which sentence they favored more strongly for convicted 
murderers -- "the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of 
parole." The answer, by nearly 2 to 1, was the death penalty -- 60% to 32% with 
8% not certain. 
</P>
<P>
This response contrasted somewhat with the findings of a poll sponsored last 
December by Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union. That 
survey, conducted by the San Francisco-based Field Institute, asked a slightly 
different question and got a different answer. It found 67% of the public 
preferring that murderers be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, if 
they also are required to work in prison to pay the victims' survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly why so many people favor capital punishment is not easily determined by 
a poll. 
</P>
<P>
Most voters think the death penalty seldom "acts as a deterrent to crime," the 
Times survey showed. The vast majority -- more than two-thirds -- also say that 
"revenge for their victims" is no reason to execute murderers. And 
three-fourths assert it is wrong "for the state to execute prisoners because it 
will save money." 
</P>
<P>
Eight in 10 people say they believe that "innocent persons are executed" 
sometimes. Still, these voters favor capital punishment by 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
More than a third of the voters say that minorities are more likely to be 
executed than Anglos even if they commit the same crime. However, two-thirds of 
the people who think this still favor the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that many people who favor capital punishment do not wrestle 
with the morality of official state executions. Asked whether "it is morally 
wrong to take a life no matter what the circumstances, or is it morally right 
to take a life depending on the circumstances," 6 in 10 said it sometimes is 
all right. But of the 3 in 10 who said taking a life is always wrong morally, a 
large majority still favored capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
There are fewer death penalty supporters in the San Francisco Bay Area than any 
other region of the state -- but even there, two-thirds of the voters favor it. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, 87% of Republicans favor capital punishment, but so do 71% of 
Democrats. Even nearly two-thirds of self-described liberals support it. 
</P>
<P>
Relating the issue to the current race for the Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination, the only candidate who personally supports the death penalty -- 
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein -- ironically is backed by voters 
with the softest attitude, relatively, toward capital punishment. Although 
nearly two-thirds of Feinstein's supporters favor capital punishment, roughly 
half say they would prefer life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, her campaign rival -- Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp -- personally 
opposes capital punishment, but he has promised to carry out executions because 
they are the law. Nearly three-fourths of his supporters favor capital 
punishment and they prefer the death penalty over life imprisonment by nearly 5 
to 3. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

Iraqi officials denied Sunday that the electronic devices seized in a 
U.S.-British sting operation last week were to be used in nuclear weapons, 
saying they were instead purchased for unspecified industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has neither the capability nor the wish to produce nuclear weapons," 
Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's deputy foreign minister, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Iraq sought the U.S.-made capacitors, which can be used to 
trigger a nuclear explosion, for research on lasers or other commercial 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon and Abdul Amir Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, 
acknowledged in U.S. television interviews that Baghdad possesses chemical 
weapons and the rockets to deliver them but insisted that the arms are purely 
defensive. 
</P>
<P>
Any use of atomic weapons in the densely populated Middle East "would be mutual 
suicide," Anbari said. "It would kill more Arabs, more Palestinians and 
Jordanians than any other adversary." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Iraqi denials, U.S. officials continue to believe that Iraq bought 
the electronic triggers as part of a large-scale covert effort to develop 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. grand jury in San Diego last week indicted five people and two British 
companies on charges that they conspired to smuggle secret nuclear technology 
from the United States to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Court papers unsealed Thursday described an 18-month sting operation resulting 
Wednesday in the arrests of four Iraqi men and one French woman. Authorities 
said a San Diego firm tipped off U.S. Customs Service agents in September, 
1988, to an Iraqi effort to buy specialized high-speed capacitors capable of 
setting off a nuclear explosion. 
</P>
<P>
A shipment of 40 triggers, under close U.S.-British surveillance, was flown to 
London early in March, where authorities switched dummy devices for the 
triggers. The suspects were picked up on Wednesday as crates containing the 
devices, labeled as air-conditioning units, were loaded aboard an Iraqi Airways 
jetliner bound for Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi officials said Sunday that the capacitors, ordered by Iraq's Ministry 
of Industry and Military Industrialization, have numerous non-military 
applications and were not part of an effort to develop atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"The device which Iraq ordered, as you know, has mostly purposes, usages, in 
commercial, scientific and medical as well as military and nuclear devices, and 
there are thousands of products like that," Anbari said on ABC's "This Week 
with David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
And he noted pointedly that Iraq has no reactor to process fuel for nuclear 
weapons. Israeli warplanes destroyed Iraq's Osirak research reactor in 1981 
because of fears that it was being built to produce enriched uranium for 
nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
All of Iraq's arms are defensive, Anbari said, "to deter any aggressor, whether 
Israeli, Iranian or anyone else. That is why we have developed long-range 
missiles, medium-range missiles, short-range missiles. . . . We have no 
capability to manufacture a nuclear device. Period. This should . . . put an 
end to all the speculations." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) scoffed at the Iraqis' protestations of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the) remarks were not so disturbing it would be almost amusing because the 
facts are the Iraqis have for over a decade been attempting to acquire nuclear 
capability," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the weapons components is "in keeping with the messianic 
mission of (Iraqi leader) Saddam Hussein to become the dominant force in the 
Mideast through the use of force and acquisition of weapons of mass 
destruction," McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States should make clear that it will "exercise all options, 
including military if necessary," to prevent Iraq from developing nuclear 
weapons, the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said Iraq used chemical weapons during the 10-year war with Iran and 
acknowledged that the poison gas attacks "in some instances had some effect on 
civilians." 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts and human rights groups have accused Baghdad of slaughtering 
thousands of ethnic Kurds as well as Iranian civilians in attacks with 
chemically armed rockets, bombs and shells. 
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said his government is prepared to discuss a regional ban on nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons but would not accept sanctions aimed at Iraq 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.) said Sunday on ABC that the U.S. government and 
private industry have contributed to the Mideast arms race by selling weapons 
of all descriptions to virtually every nation in the volatile region.

East Germany's two main parties, haggling over the makeup of a coalition 
government two weeks after the country's first free elections, united Sunday to 
attack a West German proposal for currency union. 
</P>
<P>
Angrily distancing himself from his West German patrons, East Germany's likely 
next prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere, told reporters he was not consulted 
about Bonn's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
It would exchange the East's ostmarks for Western deutschemarks at a 2-to-1 
rate, apart from small personal savings. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, speaking after talks with the Social Democrats, said he sees no 
reason to go back on his election promise to have ostmarks swapped with 
deutschemarks at par. 
</P>
<P>
His comments heralded a potential rift with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
who helped the Christian Democrats to victory in the March 18 election. The 
dispute could stall hopes to complete monetary union by July and slow the pace 
of full unification. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats, debating whether to join the Christian Democrats in East 
Germany's first non-Communist government, said they support De Maiziere's 
position on currency union. But talks remained bogged down on whether to 
include the Christian Democrats' right-wing allies, the German Social Union.

Mortar batteries and rocket launchers lighted up the sky Sunday in renewed 
violence just 24 hours after rival Christian forces reached a cease-fire 
agreement that had ended two days of bloody clashes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting between army troops loyal to Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and Samir 
Geagea's Lebanese Forces broke out around the neighboring villages of Qlaiat 
and Daraya. 
</P>
<P>
Each side maintain strategic positions in the Christian Maronite heartland of 
Keserwan, 12 miles northeast of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Automatic gunfire and artillery shelling rumbled through East Beirut, 
destroying apartment buildings and killing at least three people Sunday night, 
police and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The new violence raised the death toll close to 60 and the number of wounded to 
more than 100 in the recent days of fighting for control of the Christian 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Since the battles began Jan. 31, more than 900 people have died. 
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire agreement Saturday had ended the battles in Qlaiat that erupted 
Friday. Police said gunfire fell silent along the four-mile front line in 
Keserwan late Saturday after a Christian mediation team convinced the two rival 
leaders to hold their fire. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun is "now ready to engage in political efforts to break the deadlock (with 
Geagea) and reach a settlement," a source said Aoun had told the team, which 
has been trying to work out inter-Christian differences. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said Geagea had launched attacks against Aoun in Qlaiat to 
drive him out of Keserwan, a Lebanese Forces militia stronghold. The sources 
said Geagea wanted to distract Aoun from attacking the militia headquarters in 
East Beirut.

<P>
The plight of foreign hostages in Lebanon is continually in the news, but 
generally less known is the fact that many Lebanese themselves are seized as 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war began in 1975, no one knows how many of this country's 
citizens have been abducted and killed, by one side or the other, depending on 
their religion. 
</P>
<P>
This has come to be known as the "battle of the IDs," because religion is 
spelled out on Lebanese identity cards, and much of this activity takes place 
at the so-called Green Line that divides Beirut into predominantly Christian 
and Muslim sectors. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, a woman driving from East Beirut to West was stopped by a 
young man who wanted a ride to the other side. She agreed but, upon noticing 
that the crossing point was virtually deserted, decided to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
"But the young man begged me to keep going," she said. "It was the worst 
decision I have ever made." 
</P>
<P>
Four gunmen stepped out, stopped the car and demanded the young man's papers. 
He was not carrying them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he deliberately left them at home because people were being killed 
according to the religious affiliation shown on their IDs," the woman recalled. 
In any case, the young man was dragged out of the car and taken away. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen threatened to take the woman with them for questioning and relented 
only when her daughter, 7, began screaming. One of the men told the child: 
"Don't cry. I won't take your mother away from you." 
</P>
<P>
Like all the other women who agreed to talk with a reporter about their 
experiences, this woman asked that she not be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign women in Beirut rely on their gender as a kind of immunity, but where 
Lebanese women are concerned, it has been no help. Two years ago a young woman 
working as a paramedic was abducted along with her male partner, and their 
captors forced them to drive to a deserted area, where they were blindfolded. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they would execute my partner first, then me," the woman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
She said she heard shots and almost passed out. Then the gunmen laughed and 
removed her blindfold, revealing that her partner had not been hurt but was 
shaking with terror. 
</P>
<P>
Both were freed, and a higher-up in their captors' militia, who had interceded, 
apologized. "As we were driving back," she said, "we heard some men calling to 
us. It was our kidnapers, waving and smiling." 
</P>
<P>
She said she sees them from time to time and that they continue to greet her 
cordially. As for their motive, she guesses that she and her partner were to be 
traded for victims held in East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
For the families of Lebanese men who are abducted, life is difficult. Legally, 
the victims are not considered dead until 10 years have passed. In the 
meantime, their assets are frozen. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband's bank accounts are frozen," a Lebanese woman whose husband 
disappeared in 1985 lamented recently. She said she has turned for help to a 
lawyer, who is working his way through the red tape woven by the Lebanese 
government, which itself is hostage to the war. 
</P>
<P>
Solving financial problems has been easier for her than solving social 
problems. "People call me and others like me 'dead/alive widows,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who has two teaching jobs, does not talk openly about her husband's 
abduction for fear that her students might try to take advantage of it and 
threaten her for higher grades. 
</P>
<P>
A week before her husband was abducted, she said, his brother, the brother's 
wife and their son were abducted. The family was well-to-do, and it was assumed 
that ransom would be sought. She said her husband withdrew money from his bank 
and went to talk with the abductors, whose identity he knew. He did not return. 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions she has been approached by people who said they had 
information about her husband, information they offered to exchange for money, 
usually the equivalent of about $200. She said she has been tempted but has 
refused, although she knows others who have. 
</P>
<P>
"The foreign hostages' families have support from so many sources," she said. 
"We have no one."

1,000 LITHUANIANS RALLY IN L.A. TO SUPPORT HOMELAND; 
</P>
<P>
SECESSION: ACTIVISTS PROTEST 'SOVIET OCCUPATION' OF THE REPUBLIC. THEY CALL ON 
THE U.S. TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON GORBACHEV.

<P>
Nearly 1,000 Lithuanian activists thronged outside the Federal Building in 
Westwood on Sunday to protest increased Soviet pressure on their homeland to 
renounce its declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
As Lithuanian community leaders exhorted the Soviet Union to permit 
independence in the Baltic republic, demonstrators torched the Soviet flag, 
chanted anti-Gorbachev slogans and hoisted signs denouncing "Soviet occupation" 
of their country. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers also criticized President Bush for playing what they see as too 
limited a role in the republic's efforts to win freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"We are protesting the Bush Administration's silence and refusal to give 
diplomatic representation to the Lithuanian government," said Tony Mazeika, the 
director of the Baltic American Freedom League. 
</P>
<P>
Mazeika said that Lithuanian activists are incensed over several bilateral 
trade agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"(Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev needs those agreements," he said. "He 
needs them to stay in power. They are very crucial. But the Lithuanian people 
need to be free." 
</P>
<P>
On March 11, the republic declared its independence from the Soviet Union, 
which annexed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1940. Estonia has pledged to 
join the Baltic independence movement, and Latvia is expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Gorbachev urged the republic to renounce its declaration of 
independence and negotiate with the Kremlin within provisions of the Soviet 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian government has shown no willingness to back down, however, and 
in Westwood, demonstrators cheered that stance and vowed that Lithuanians would 
withstand any Soviet efforts to deny the tiny Baltic state its freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lithuanians are determined in their hearts to do everything in their means 
to gain independence," said Lithuanian national Arvydas Jakeliunas, who arrived 
Sunday in Los Angeles to visit relatives. "The troops are working on them 
psychologically, but they are determined not to let this stop them." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians, who were joined in their protest here by small bands of 
Armenians and Estonians, called on the United States to step up pressure on the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get as many Americans as we can to demand freedom for 
Lithuania," said Aldona Venckunas, who fled Lithuania in 1950 with her family 
to escape what she called Soviet repression. "We want Bush to support us in 
stronger words and economic sanctions. We don't want any 'favored nations' 
trade agreement with the Soviet Union."

STALLED TALKS POINT TO SPLIT IN ANC; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: THE GROUP'S LEADERSHIP HAS LOST TOUCH WITH ITS GRASS-ROOTS 
SUPPORT, SOME SAY.

<P>
The African National Congress' decision to suspend planned talks with Pretoria, 
imperiling the South African peace process even before it begins, is a clear 
sign that ANC leaders and their supporters remain deeply divided over the idea 
of negotiating with the white-led government, analysts said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The ANC leadership is out of touch with the kind of passions and concerns on 
the ground, where many still find it very difficult to talk to 'the oppressor 
(the government),' " said Robert Shrire, a professor of African studies at the 
University of Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly backing away from a promise to meet with the government is the 
"politically inept way in which a fairly leaderless movement is responding 
opportunistically to grass-roots pressure," Shrire added. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the turmoil in the ANC's leadership ranks was evident at a news 
conference Sunday when Nelson R. Mandela, the new ANC deputy president, 
acknowledged differences of opinion with his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Mandela told an estimated 300,000 people at an ANC rally near 
Port Elizabeth that he is prepared to meet with President Frederik W. de Klerk 
soon to discuss ways of ending renewed violence in the country. But he said he 
will not lead an official delegation for talks with De Klerk's government until 
Pretoria responds to ANC complaints about police killings of peaceful 
demonstrators. Only then, Mandela said, will the ANC and the government work 
out a new date for formal talks. 
</P>
<P>
Most political analysts believe that the ANC has the most to lose by delaying 
its first face-to-face meeting with the government, which had been scheduled 
for April 11 in Cape Town. The two sides were to discuss obstacles to 
black-white talks, which include ANC demands that the 45-month-old state of 
emergency be lifted and that political prisoners be freed. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, in a telephone call from Mandela to De Klerk on Friday, called off 
those historic talks to protest police shootings in Sebokeng that touched off a 
day of violence and left at least 15 black protesters dead. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has won worldwide praise for his efforts to get negotiations with the 
black majority under way and his willingness to talk to the ANC -- the first 
white South African leader in 40 years to open his door to the movement. The 
ANC, by refusing to at least talk with De Klerk, risks being branded an 
extremist organization and losing support internationally as well as from the 
South African whites it is trying to woo. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has promised to look into the police shootings, but he said such 
incidents are the key reason that the government and the ANC need to begin 
talking. "I told Mandela my door remained open and he was welcome to meet with 
me," De Klerk said. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, the primary anti-apartheid movement in the country, has been rocked by 
the rapid reforms introduced by De Klerk. Since De Klerk legalized the ANC and 
freed Mandela last month, the ANC has been trying to reformulate its policies 
while re-establishing itself inside the country. 
</P>
<P>
Several generations of ANC leaders inside the country now are free from prison, 
but the final decisions are made by the ANC's 35-member national executive 
committee, which has yet to return from exile in Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
ANC support inside the country over the years has been spread broadly across 
the spectrum of black politics, from radical young activists to older 
moderates. Now, disagreement among ANC leaders over how to respond to De 
Klerk's initiatives has robbed the group of the powerful voice it needs to 
bring its supporters in line, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"They're having serious problems on the ground," says a leader of the rival 
Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC). Support already appears to be growing for more 
radical black groups such as the PAC, which has flatly refused to negotiate 
with the government until it dismantles apartheid and agrees to hand over power 
to the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk supports a one-person, one-vote system but wants whites protected from 
black domination. Blacks, who have no vote in national affairs, outnumber 
whites 4 to 1 in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has taken considerable political risks in loosening restrictions on 
political expression to lure black leaders to his negotiating table. So far he 
has managed to maintain white support for those reforms, but many whites are 
worried about the upsurge of violence, and analysts think the president needs 
to make rapid progress toward a peaceful resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The desire of older ANC leaders, especially the 71-year-old Mandela, to talk 
with De Klerk has divided ANC supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The ANC leadership has gone the celebrity route rather than the organizational 
route," Shrire said. "While they've been acting as international stars, no one 
has been at home minding the store." 
</P>
<P>
Disarray in the ANC hierarchy has been evident for weeks. Last week, the ANC 
suddenly backed out of a joint rally in which political rivals Mandela and Zulu 
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi would have shared a podium in a bold attempt 
to end the bloody factional fighting between their supporters in Natal 
province. 
</P>
<P>
"For an organization that claims a commitment to the principle that South 
Africans should talk rather than shoot their way out of trouble, the ANC 
displays a remarkable reticence to talk," the Sunday Times, the largest 
circulation newspaper in South Africa, said in an editorial Sunday.

AFGHANISTAN: AMPUTEES FLOOD DAILY INTO KABUL FOR HELP. MANY MUST WAIT MONTHS 
FOR ARTIFICIAL LIMBS.

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roshan Gul and Anar Gul are not related by blood, only by tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
They bear the same last name, and their villages were not so far apart in the 
days before both were bombed to rubble. Yet it took the same war that has been 
destroying their homeland to bring the two women together recently -- at the 
Red Cross limb factory in Kabul, where they patiently waited for their new 
artificial legs. 
</P>
<P>
The Guls are among the ranks of what experts say is Afghanistan's 
fastest-growing population -- war-wounded amputees who are perhaps the starkest 
metaphor for a civil conflict that continues to disfigure an entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, amputees fill the urban bazaars of Kabul, hobbling around bomb 
craters and rocket holes on the capital's ramshackle streets. At virtually 
every intersection in every city, they can be seen struggling through traffic 
and clinging to buses. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a decade of bombing runs, rocket and missile barrages and 
massive mine-seeding programs, these legless men, women and children -- whose 
total is estimated at 100,000 -- represent what experts believe to be the 
world's largest war amputee population. In fact, the number of amputees is so 
large that almost every shoe shop in Kabul has a section selling half-pairs 
only. 
</P>
<P>
And the numbers may climb as Afghan refugees begin returning to their villages, 
which are still heavily mined. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nowhere else in the world with a problem of these dimensions," said 
Claude Alain-Amiet, the Red Cross orthopedist who built the state-of-the-art 
Kabul limb factory from scratch two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Anar and Roshan Gul are typical of the amputees. 
</P>
<P>
Anar, who still has the face of child, was 13 when she tripped a hidden land 
mine three years ago. Her right leg was blown off at the knee. Her parents had 
sent her to explore their family grazing land on the once-idyllic shores of 
Kabul's Karga Lake after it was vacated by a military regiment. 
</P>
<P>
Roshan, a 40-year-old whose face already is deeply lined, was home in her mud 
hut when her village, eight miles north of Kabul, was caught in an artillery 
barrage between government forces and the moujahedeen rebels. A rocket hit the 
hut, and the blizzard of shrapnel sheared off her right leg at the thigh. That 
was five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, early last month, the two women found their separate ways to the Red 
Cross limb factory. 
</P>
<P>
Amiet, the Swiss project director, already has worked with amputees for the Red 
Cross in Lebanon and Angola and contends that the fundamental problem in 
Afghanistan is underdevelopment, compounded by the sheer numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the amputees interviewed at the Red Cross center had lost their limbs 
at least two years earlier, an indication of the length of time it takes a 
wounded villager to reach the Kabul center. 
</P>
<P>
Barbaric surgery practices, poor logistics and acute shortages of medicine have 
deepened the crisis, Amiet said. Now, he said, his factory is producing and 
fitting a record 105 custom-made artificial legs every month -- and still there 
are 3,000 amputees on the waiting list, with each month of war adding scores 
more. 
</P>
<P>
In Angola, he recalled, "the amputations were done better than here. When mine 
victims came in, the Cuban surgeons tried to save at least one of the legs. 
Here, they just cut them both. They just don't care. So we have about 8% double 
amputees here." 
</P>
<P>
Lecturing Afghan war surgeons a year ago, a Red Cross surgeon, Dr. Kenneth 
Barent, spent nearly an hour detailing proper triage procedures that can 
prevent infections of war wounds, and he appealed to them to try save limbs 
rather than try to save time in the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
Still, legless civilians and soldiers alike continue to come in. First, they 
are fitted for a pair of crutches and are given a number on the waiting list; 
several months later, they get an appointment to begin the long process of 
fitting and manufacturing new legs. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the scene in the center's courtyard is depressing: Dozens of 
hobbling men, women and children; women like Anar and Roshan Gul sitting idly 
on the floor; old men stumbling as they try to walk again, and double amputees 
from isolated villages struggling with sophisticated wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
But beneath the surface there is something different about these war wounded -- 
something that Red Cross workers say is as extraordinary as their huge numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one thing that sets these amputees apart," said one British 
physiotherapist at the center who has also worked with amputees in Cambodia and 
Lebanon. "With very few exceptions, they never seem to go through the stage of 
depression that most amputees experience. There's just a whole different spirit 
in these people -- stoic will to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in interviews with more than a dozen legless, it was clear that they 
have retained their dignity and hope. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Younis, for example, refused to give up when he stepped on a mine in 
Kunduz province four years ago. His face lit up with a proud, toothless grin 
through a yellowing beard as he rolled up his tattered trousers to show off an 
artificial leg that he made himself out of scrap metal and discarded bicycle 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
Younis, 68, is a bicycle repair man by trade, so, he explained, he fixed his 
leg the same way he would a crumpled bike. 
</P>
<P>
Raz and Lal Mohammed, 13-year-old cousins, are even more extraordinary, Red 
Cross workers said. Both boys lost both their legs a year ago when they stepped 
simultaneously on two land mines while walking to their uncle's house. 
</P>
<P>
The boys have been walking on their new Red Cross legs for several months now 
and have become role models for other amputees, helping every day to run 
physiotherapy classes at the limb factory. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what they want to do when they grow up, both respond, "I want to be 
a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
In the women's dormitory at the factory, where Roshan and Anar Gul fill their 
time sewing prayer scarfs and chatting about their families, the same spirit 
came through. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a seamstress by profession," Roshan explained. "When my husband was 
alive, we had a fine field of crops. We had children. We had a life. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I've lost everything. No money; my husband is dead; my children are gone; 
my leg is cut, and I have forgotten everything because of this war," she said. 
"But what I have lost, I have lost. I only pray that God will keep others from 
losing their lives, and that is what I live for -- for those prayers." 
</P>
<P>
Anar, the 16-year-old, said she has the same prayer. But for her, the future 
appears to be more difficult. Perhaps it was her age; many Afghan girls are 
preparing for marriage at 16. 
</P>
<P>
But when asked to tell her dreams for her life, a tear formed at the corner of 
Anar's right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Looking down, she said quietly, "Every night when I am sleeping, I dream that I 
have my leg back."

Police slammed shut 23 more illegal social clubs early Sunday, hoping to 
prevent a repeat of the blaze that killed 87 people last week in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown came as the bodies of 48 victims of the Happy Land social club 
fire arrived in Honduras, the impoverished Central American country many had 
left in search of a better life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A special police task force has issued vacate orders to a total of 346 illicit 
clubs since a sweep by the city began last Sunday, Officer Anthony Mazzola 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, citing police records, reported Sunday that 52 of the 1,255 
clubs listed as "nuisance" establishments were in properties owned by the city, 
including two in Housing Authority projects. The records portray the city as 
the largest landlord of such clubs.

COURT ASKED TO UPHOLD STAY OF EXECUTION 
</P>

Lawyers for convicted murderer Robert Alton Harris on Sunday urged the U.S. 
Supreme Court to allow more time for a federal appeals court in San Francisco 
to reconsider Harris' case and reject a bid by California officials to proceed 
with his execution on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a 30-page motion filed with the court late Sunday afternoon, Harris' lawyers 
said the justices should give "great deference" to the move by Judge John T. 
Noonan on Friday to indefinitely stay the execution. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Noonan has been thoroughly familiar with the facts and history and 
record of this case," the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, lawyers for the state filed a 40-page motion with Justice Sandra 
Day O'Connor urging that Noonan's stay be lifted so the execution could proceed 
as planned at 3 a.m. Tuesday at San Quentin prison. O'Connor is likely to refer 
the Harris matter to the entire court for a decision. 
</P>
<P>
In their recent efforts to spare Harris from the gas chamber, his lawyers have 
been contending that Harris had incompetent psychiatric help at his 1979 trial. 
On Friday, Noonan agreed that this claim raised a reasonable issue that should 
be considered further by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals. Therefore, he issued a stay of execution pending that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In their filing with the U.S. Supreme Court, the lawyers said: "The stay 
ensures some semblance of order in a situation unnecessarily filled with haste 
and confusion. It . . . allows orderly review of the substantial federal 
constitutional claims raised by Mr. Harris." 
</P>
<P>
The justices will issue orders in pending cases at 10 a.m. today, but no 
further public meetings are scheduled during the day. After leaving the bench 
at 10 a.m., the justices could go behind closed doors to consider the motions 
on the Harris case and issue an order later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
While the high court could lift the stay and let Harris go to the gas chamber 
as scheduled, doing so would amount to a rebuke of a prominent appeals court 
judge. Noonan is a 1985 appointee of President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
But state attorneys argued in their motion Saturday that Noonan fundamentally 
misstated a 1985 Supreme Court ruling on psychiatrists. In issuing his stay 
order, Noonan read the 1985 case as creating a "federal constitutional right . 
. . (to) competent psychiatric assistance." 
</P>
<P>
He also compounded the error by applying the ruling retroactively, the state 
lawyers contended. Just in the last month, the high court said Death Row 
inmates should not get the benefit of high court rulings issued after their 
convictions were upheld in the state courts. Harris' conviction and death 
sentence were upheld in 1981, four years before the 1985 ruling on psychiatric 
help.

The California Republican Assembly, the largest and most conservative 
grass-roots endorsing body in state GOP politics, shunned the candidacy of U.S. 
Sen. Pete Wilson for governor Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The assembly instead voted, 170 to 78, to issue no endorsement for governor and 
"a vote of no confidence" in Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative group cited Wilson's pro-choice stance on abortion as the 
principal issue defeating his bid. But Wilson was also criticized for 
"anti-free enterprise" environmental votes.

With the help of noted science fiction writers and the creator of "Star Trek," 
a cable television company hopes to boldly go where no channel has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
From pre-Sputnik space alien thrillers to advanced digital animation to reruns 
of "My Favorite Martian," it's all going to be beamed down by the Science 
Fiction Channel Inc., says its president and chief promoter. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the 24-hour channel to debut Dec. 31, said Mitchell Rubenstein, 
who organized investors last year and recruited a board of advisers that 
includes author Isaac Asimov and "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry. 
</P>
<P>
Rubenstein said programming deals have been made with several small cable 
operators representing about 500,000 subscribers in Colorado, California and 
Florida. Material distributed by the company predicts at least 5 million 
subscribers by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Rubenstein said many new shows are planned, including a robot detective series 
created by Asimov, author of more than 400 books and articles and an early 
proponent of robotics.

STREET SMART: A TIP FOR LIFE IN BIKE LANE: KEEP WITS ABOUT YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I've been riding my bike more and more recently. It bothers me when cars park 
in the marked bike lane. When is it, if ever, all right to park or drive in a 
marked bike lane? It seems dangerous for me to have to veer outside the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Tucker 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
Life in the bike lane isn't always so pleasant. If there isn't some Beemer 
veering willy-nilly across the painted white line, there's a Coupe de Ville 
crammed against the curb, its rear bumper waiting to gobble up any errant 
cyclist who happens by. 
</P>
<P>
While the rules of the bike lane can vary from city to city, most 
municipalities allow cars to pull into the paths about 200 feet before a corner 
to make a right turn. Moreover, cars generally can park in the paths as long as 
there are no signs posted prohibiting it. In some spots within the county, this 
can virtually eliminate the lanes, forcing cyclists out into the street along 
with the growling packs of cars. 
</P>
<P>
A few tips from the experts: If you have to veer around a parked car, avoid 
darting into the traffic lane. Instead, try to anticipate the move and begin 
gradually moving out so any cars can see you well in advance and avoid you 
accordingly. Also, be careful to swing wide enough around the parked car so 
you'll avoid the door if a motorist swings it open. 
</P>
<P>
At times, of course, motorists won't take kindly to a cyclist using the traffic 
lane to avoid a parked car. They'll honk. They'll scream. They'll cuss. But the 
fact of the matter is, cyclists have as much right to the traffic lane if 
they're steering around an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, conflicts between cyclists and motorists can sometimes escalate 
into something just short of war. Some stories have become legend. 
</P>
<P>
One recent day, a cyclist in South County was tooling along a remote road when 
a car began veering into the lane repeatedly. The cyclist yelled at the driver, 
who in turn rolled down his passenger-side window and shouted obscenities at 
the cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclist returned fire by pulling out his water bottle and squirting the 
motorist and his female passenger. Outraged, the driver cut off the cyclist, 
jumped from the car and began pounding on the befuddled cyclist. The melee was 
broken up only when the cyclist's riding partners caught up. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was a relatively rare incident that escalated well beyond 
reason. But the point is clear: When cycling, keep your wits about you. A 
person on a bicycle is a lot more vulnerable than someone strapped into a ton 
of sheet metal. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Does Caltrans have any plans to build a grade separation that would allow 
drivers on the northbound San Diego Freeway to exit at Bristol Street in Costa 
Mesa without having to cross two lanes of high-speed traffic coming off the 
connector road leading from the Costa Mesa Freeway to the northbound San Diego 
Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
Building such a grade separation will not merely remove a nuisance. When 
traffic backs up from the Bristol off-ramp (as it frequently does), a serious 
conflict is created between cars moving at full speed on the connector road and 
cars slowing (or completely stopping) for the Bristol off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
There also appears to be plenty of right of way for Caltrans to build the 
necessary bridge for the freeway connector road to pass over traffic moving 
into the Bristol exit's lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Shank 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
That stretch of roadway is indeed a problem for motorists eager to pull 
smoothly off the freeway at Bristol Street and hit the Nordie racks at South 
Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that transportation officials are eyeing the strip for 
improvement. The bad news is that any solutions are probably still far off. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa authorities are planning to use developer fees to build a new, 
elevated connector road so Bristol Street-bound motorists won't have to mix it 
up with folks trying to head north from the Costa Mesa Freeway onto the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't look for it any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just now getting the ball rolling," said Bill Morris, Costa Mesa public 
services director. "We are years away."

Titan junior left-hander Huck Flener pitched a six-hitter, walking four and 
striking out five, in raising his record to 5-1 before a crowd of about 250. 
</P>
<P>
The supposed weak third of the Fullerton batting order did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Charles (No. 7 hitter), Domingo Mota (No. 8) and Kevin Farlow (No. 9) 
combined for an eight-for-11 performance at the plate with five runs and all 
six runs batted in. The trio went eight for eight before it made all three outs 
in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the damage was done by Farlow, a junior transfer from USC. He had a 
three-run home run in the second inning, an RBI single in the fourth and a 
sacrifice fly in the sixth. Farlow's five RBIs were a season-high. He now has 
16 RBIs and is batting .221. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow's home run came after Charles started a two-out rally with a single. 
Mota followed with an infield single and the pair moved up a base on a balk by 
Irvine starter and loser David Bladow (4-2). Farlow then hit an inside fastball 
over the left-field fence for his third home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure if it was out," Farlow said. "But as I was going down to first, 
I peeked and saw it was gone." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (17-13, 2-1), which collected 10 hits, struck again in the fourth 
after two were out. Charles hit an infield single, Mota singled Charles to 
second and Farlow singled to left for another RBI. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Fullerton got two more. Matt Hattabaugh singled, was sacrificed 
to second, and scored on an RBI single to left by Charles, who had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Mota got his third hit as well and Charles went to third. Farlow then hit a fly 
ball to center, deep enough to score Charles with the final run. 
</P>
<P>
After Farlow's home run, UC Irvine's offense was little more than a memory 
against Flener, who retired 11 in a row before Al Rodriguez's leadoff single in 
the ninth. But Flener recovered quickly, getting Fred Combs to fly out to 
right, and Osmar DeChavez to ground into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Flener retired 15 of the final 17 batters and lowered his earned-run average to 
2.89. His relative ease in handling Irvine in the final innings made it hard to 
believe how much he struggled at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
Flener gave up a hit and a walk in the first inning, then threw a wild pitch 
with two outs, allowing the runners to advance. DeChavez lined a single to 
right for one run, but Flener was saved any further struggle when Rich 
Gonzales' throw got Combs at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Rodriguez singled and went to third on Flener's wild pickoff 
throw. Then Flener got tough. Combs struck out, DeChavez popped to third and, 
after Mike Goodcase walked, Craig Plumley popped to first to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to prove to myself I could leave him at third," Flener said. "I saw 
it as a challenge . . . I made a few adjustments with my stride today to throw 
strikes after the first few innings. I couldn't throw a curveball for a strike 
to save my life, but I was able to spot the fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took the final two games of the three-game, weekend series as Irvine 
fell to 22-13, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
"This ballclub's been knocked down and kicked around before," Irvine Coach Mike 
Gerakos said. "But we've gotten up before. There's no reason to panic. There 
are a lot of games left to play." 
</P>

Fed Votes Steady Credit Policy: The Federal Reserve voted to hold interest 
rates steady at its meeting in February, saying inflation was under control, 
according to just-released minutes of the meeting. The February meeting 
occurred as concerns about inflation were heightening, mostly because of a 
surge in energy prices that has since abated. Consumer prices rose about 4.6% 
last year, compared to 4.4% in 1988.

AARP Closing Credit Union: The American Assn. of Retired Persons said it plans 
to close its 2-year-old credit union because of a lack of interest from its 
members. AARP, the nation's largest organization for older Americans, said all 
savings would be protected in the phase-out, which still must be approved by 
the credit union's 90,000 members.

Fraud Claimed in Statue Sale: Two men who claimed they were sold a bogus 
half-interest in a purported Michelangelo statue filed a multimillion suit 
against the seller and international auction house Sotheby's Inc. The Los 
Angeles Superior Court suit filed by Ronald E. Faulk of Glendale and Robert E. 
Fitzgerald of Indianapolis claims that they were led to believe they were 
buying a 50% share of Michelangelo's model for the statue "David." After 
spending more than $500,000, the buyers learned that the statue is owned by 
someone else and is of "unknown origin," the suit said.

Trial Date Set in Poison Gas Suit: A massive suit stemming from a poisonous gas 
cloud at the General Motors assembly plant in Van Nuys was tentatively set for 
trial on Sept. 18 in Los Angeles. The Superior Court case was brought by more 
than 40 General Motors workers, who claim they were injured when a chlorine gas 
cloud was released at the company's Van Nuys plant on March 13, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says the accident occurred when sodium hypochloride -- and not 
aluminum sulphate -- mistakenly was loaded into a tanker and delivered to the 
GM plant, then put into a tank that had contained aluminum sulphate, triggering 
the gas cloud. Defendants are Imperial West Chemical Company and California 
Tank Lines, both of which also have been sued by General Motors. (Case Nos. 
C572299, NWC 16920)

Law Firm Accused of Wrongful Firing: The prominent Los Angeles law firm of 
Latham &amp; Watkins was sued in Los Angeles Superior Thursday by a former 
paralegal who claims that she was fired for "blowing the whistle" about the 
firm's alleged overbilling. 
</P>
<P>
Robyn R. Devereaux said she was terminated after two years because she told the 
firm's clients, opposing attorneys and a federal judge about alleged 
overbilling by Latham in litigation over the DuPont Plaza Hotel fire in Puerto 
Rico. Steven Stanwyck, the law firm's attorney, said the allegations are 
groundless and called Devereaux a convicted felon who has other actions pending 
against the firm. (Filed March 29, Case No. C756772)

Boesky Due for Release: Ivan F. Boesky, Wall Street's most notorious felon, may 
be a free man this week. The former arbitrager is due for official release on 
Wednesday, two years after he entered prison for his role in the nation's 
biggest insider trading scandal, a source close to Boesky said. However, the 
source said Boesky was released into home custody about six weeks ago.

Southmark Sets Deal With Creditors: Southmark Corp., a Dallas-based real estate 
holding company that filed for bankruptcy protection last July, said its 
unsecured creditors agreed on a new reorganization plan calling for a quicker 
payout to creditors than the company offered in its original reorganization 
proposal. The agreement, to be filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, 
also restructures some securities and proposes a reduction in payout to 
Southmark's equity holders, the company said.

Parents Blame Son's Murder on Bank: Wells Fargo Bank was sued in Los Angeles 
Superior Court Wednesday by an Oregon couple, Frank and Susan Chase, who 
contend that their son, Mathew Marshall Chase, was kidnaped and fatally shot 
because of poor security and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, 22-year-old Chase disappeared after he went to a Wells Fargo 
branch in Los Angeles to make a deposit at an automated teller machine. His 
body was found in March, 1989. The suit says Chase was abducted after the 
machine mistakenly indicated that he had insufficient funds to withdraw cash, 
presumably angering his assailants. (Filed March 28, Case No. C756791)

PRIME MINISTER TO CALL BUSH

Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was to reach a final decision later today on a 
package of reforms designed to remove impediments to trade between Japan and 
the United States. Kaifu was expected to then call President Bush to urge him 
to accept the proposals just hours before his negotiators present them to 
Washington officials. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu's plan to call Bush early today was extremely unusual and underscored the 
critical nature of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to win Bush's approval of the reform package that Japanese negotiators, 
who arrived in Washington over the weekend, will present today could imperil 
both U.S.-Japan relations and Kaifu's own grasp on power. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing opposition from bureaucrats to reforms the United States has been 
demanding as part of the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative talks -- 
the centerpiece of Bush's trade policy toward Japan -- delayed a decision that 
Kaifu originally had intended to make Friday. Meetings both Saturday and Sunday 
with key cabinet ministers also failed to overcome the resistance. SAM JAMESON

JACK SMITH: THE OL' MODEL T STILL REVS UP FANS' ENTHUSIASM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In saying the other day that no man ever forgets his first Model T Ford, I 
should also have said no woman ever forgets her husband or boy friend's first 
Model T. 
</P>
<P>
On the stationery of the Model T Ford Club of America (San Fernando Valley 
Chapter), Clara Jo Ostergren writes that she is so involved with her husband, 
Ben, in his love for his 1922 model that she is secretary of the club and 
editor of its newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Like me, Ben bought his 1922 in the late 1930s; he drove his to high school in 
St. Paul, Minn. "He remembered it so fondly," Mrs. Ostergren says, "that three 
years ago he decided to get another one like it. He finally found one in . . . 
Hudson, Ohio, and rushed there with his truck and trailer to bring it home. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Lester F. Ziegler of Arcadia encloses a panegyric he wrote for Old Cars Weekly 
some years ago about his first T -- a 1913 model that was 7 years old when he 
acquired it as a boy. "A lad of 15 yet to know the scrape of a razor, a rural 
crossroads town, and for the first time -- a genuine, stem-winding automobile 
of my very own. . . . I photographically remember her every contour, 
provocation, dent and rewarding exhilaration. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Debra Wilson insists it was her way with her boyfriend's Model T that caused 
him to marry her. When she met him in 1977, he was building a 1924 Model T 
roadster from parts. "When it stopped running, the one who didn't know how to 
drive it (me!) had to push it to get it going. My husband has always said he 
married me because I was the only girl he knew who would push the Model T fast 
enough to get it going!" On their wedding day they rode home in the rain in the 
open roadster. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several readers have written to correct Robert Taylor's recollection 
of driving a 1918 Model T from Los Angeles to Phoenix in 1926, when he was 16. 
Taylor said they drove several miles over a road of railroad ties that 
traversed the sand dunes between Yuma and Phoenix. That road, I am told, was 
made of planks, not ties, and was between Calexico and Yuma, in California. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert Ford of Yucca Valley says it was called the Board Road, not the Plank 
Road, as some have called it. He says it ran between Holtville and Winterhaven, 
in California. "It was made up of one-inch boards fastened together with 
flexible metal strips." 
</P>
<P>
Ford owned a 1922 Model T touring car he had bought for $4. It had been 
hacksawed into a roadster. He used it to deliver papers and finally sold it for 
$5. "The buyer drove it off on the rims." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor says he still remembers the road as being made of railroad ties and 
running between Yuma and Phoenix. But that was long ago. Dr. Graham Gilmore Jr. 
of Orange questions another part of Taylor's saga. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor told of climbing down a ladder of an abandoned mine pit; a rung broke 
and he hung by his hands, his feet bicycling in air, until his brother tied one 
end of a rope to the Ford's axle and lowered the other end to Bob, who tied it 
around his waist and was pulled up. 
</P>
<P>
"Regarding your vivid description of poor Bob Taylor hanging on the last rung 
of a ladder in a deserted mine shaft with both hands, his feet both dangling 
helplessly. Please, if you will, describe for your faithful followers how he 
tied the cord around his waist while in this predicament." 
</P>
<P>
That was Taylor's vivid description, not mine. I forgot to ask him about it 
when I phoned him to ask about the road. But the answer is easy. He simply 
placed his feet on a higher rung and balanced there while he tied the rope 
around his waist. Not easy, but possible. 
</P>
<P>
My own recollection of driving my 1922 T around the Southern California 
mountains from one CCC camp to another is questioned by Zane Boychuk of 
Carlsbad, who writes that Model Ts couldn't climb. 
</P>
<P>
"The T had big problems in climbing because the gravity-fed gas would not flow 
to the carb, and the driver would have to back the hot-rod up the grade. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Here I hang in air, my feet bicycling . . .

Bad Reviews: Spanish writer Camilo Jose Cela, winner of the 1989 Nobel Prize 
for literature, didn't impress a group of Miami students. "He was quite rude," 
said Karla Agurcia, 15, of Carver Middle School, where Cela, 73, spoke. "We 
asked him to sign a paper and he said, 'No, I only sign books.' " Cela has a 
reputation for eccentricity and little concern for what people think of him. "I 
think he said what first came to his mind. . . . I don't think he was 
organized; he didn't have any notes," said Christine Turner, 11.

Liberty, please: A Chinese magazine that published dissidents' works before it 
was banned and a jailed Malawian poet have won PEN American Center's 1990 
"freedom to write awards," $3,000 prizes that are part of the writers' group's 
worldwide campaign for free expression. Novelist Larry McMurtry, American PEN's 
president, will present the prizes Wednesday, in absentia, to poet Jack 
Mapanje, formerly a teacher at the University of Malawi, and Today magazine, 
founded in 1978, primarily by poet Zhao Zhenkai, better known by his pen-name, 
Bei Dao. Mapanje, 46, has been held without charges in Malawi since his arrest 
Sept. 25, 1987, PEN American Center said. Chinese authorities shut down Today 
in 1980.

Book Designs: The late designer Halston will be the subject of a biography, 
"Simply Halston," due out next fall from G.P. Putnam's Sons. Author Steven 
Gaines said Halston's death from AIDS last week was "a great loss to both the 
design industry and to all the people who cared about him." Gaines' previous 
work includes books on the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Alice Cooper and evangelist 
Marjoe Gortner.

Communing: Homeless advocate Mitch Snyder of Washington, D.C., is planning a 
different kind of sabbatical. "It's not really time away from the madness," 
Snyder said of his plan to spend a month in a Trappist monastery in Virginia. 
"It's more a matter of time spent just with God. Over the past month, I've been 
increasingly feeling that need." Snyder, 46, whose battles for the homeless 
were portrayed in a TV movie, denied his decision was influenced by recent 
setbacks for his movement.

BENEFIT: CROSBY, STILLS, NASH &amp; YOUNG HONOR THEIR DRUMMER DALLAS TAYLOR, 
WHO NEEDS A LIVER TRANSPLANT, AND RAISE FUNDS TO BATTLE DRUG ABUSE. 
</P>

<P>
Benefit concerts have turned into rock's hottest guessing game. As soon as the 
official lineups are announced for these multi-act shows, fans begin 
speculating on who'll show up for the de rigueur all-star jams at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The guessing at events that charge more than $100 a ticket usually begins with 
one of the Big Bs -- Bob or Bruce -- and proceeds through the alphabet: R these 
days for Bonnie Raitt, S invariably for Sting, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, the guessing lasted 
until just after midnight, when it was apparent that the only "extra" was the 
man in whose honor the concert was held: drummer Dallas Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the original drummer with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, sat in with 
his old mates for the first time in nearly 20 years on two of CSNY's best-known 
numbers, "Wooden Ships" and "Teach Your Children." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, whose career was ruined in the '70s by drug abuse, has been an abuse 
counselor himself for about five years and learned last November that he is in 
desperate need of a liver transplant. He is now on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's concert -- which also featured Don Henley and the Desert Rose Band 
-- was designed to focus attention on the organ donor program and to raise 
funds for the Freda Foundation, a nonprofit drug abuse research and education 
organization. It was expected to raise about $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the artists said good night as they left the stage, much of the 
audience remained, waiting for some sort of surprise. Since David Crosby and 
Chris Hillman -- now leader of the Desert Rose Band -- were both on hand, maybe 
there would be a repeat of the Byrds mini-reunion that occurred in February at 
the Roy Orbison/homeless benefit at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Or because Neil Young and Stephen Stills had both performed, there was a chance 
of a partial Buffalo Springfield regrouping. Henley's presence could have meant 
a partial Eagles assembly. 
</P>
<P>
But the closest any of this came to reality was early in the evening when 
former Eagle Timothy B. Schmit joined Henley as he sang the Eagles' 1974 hit 
"The Best of My Love." 
</P>
<P>
While the speculation is inevitable in a city that is home to so many 
celebrated musicians, the preoccupation with "surprise" and "history" tends to 
undercut the natural drama of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the emotional surge of seeing Taylor on stage again, the musical 
highlights of the night were tied strictly to individual artistry, not 
nostalgic repackaging. The most compelling art was provided by Henley and 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
Their approaches were vastly different. Henley was joined by a dozen musicians 
and surprised the crowd with his own version of Johnny Mercer and Harold 
Arlen's "Come Rain or Come Shine," while Young paced the stage anxiously with 
just his own guitar. 
</P>
<P>
They were linked by the independence and excellence of their material, as both 
men sang about troubling social concerns -- Henley's "The End of the 
Innocence," Young's "Rockin' in the Free World" -- without sacrificing idealism 
and hope. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise guests at the end might have given the evening more of an emotional 
buzz, but it is unlikely that they would have matched the power and passion of 
Henley and Young. Yet the curiosity lingers. The mainly acoustic program was to 
have been repeated Sunday night, this time to benefit the California 
Environmental Protection Act. And Saturday you could hear people on the way out 
already speculating on who might join the lineup. The guessing was soon halfway 
through the alphabet.

DAVIES BRINGS HIS BONN ORCHESTRA TO COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Symphonic bands from far and farther continue to visit Segerstrom Hall at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. Friday, the Orchester der Beethovenhalle 
Bonn made an appearance there before an enthusiastic audience. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the accomplished, 121-member orchestra was led, with his usual 
vigor and panache, by Dennis Russell Davies. Unfortunately, Davies and his 
ensemble from the West German capital -- now on an inaugural North American 
tour -- brought a program of no special interest to the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society series. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old American conductor, who is artistic director of the City of 
Bonn, and who will soon also head the musical fortunes of the Brooklyn Academy 
and the Brooklyn Philharmonic in this country, makes sensible, fascinating 
musical agendas. He has been doing so -- in St. Paul, Stuttgart and Santa Cruz, 
to name three of his bases of operations -- for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
This program made sense, and certainly showed the Beethovenhalle orchestra -- 
it is named after the theater where it performs -- to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But, alas, the line-up consisted of second-rate works by first-rank composers. 
Such agendas, no matter how well delivered, always send listeners home 
unsatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
In balanced, aggressive and thoughtful readings, Beethoven's "King Stephan" 
Overture, Schumann's "Konzertstuck," for four horns and orchestra, and 
Prokofiev's Sixth Symphony all gave pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
With often thin-sounding strings, a mediocre wind contingent and middling solo 
players, the Bonn orchestra is no virtuoso band. But under Davies it plays 
decently and, in this debut appearance, with genuine confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a certain hunger panged the observer when this occasion was over. One 
had to admire the single-mindedness and probity of Davies' way with "King 
Stephan," despite some raggednesses of execution in the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
And the gloom-pervaded beauties in Prokofiev's wartime Sixth Symphony emerged 
well articulated -- some of the playing achieving real brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
Davies obviously believes in this pessimistic score and has convinced his 
colleagues of its importance. They performed with conviction. And the 
linearity, the surge of the conductor's vision, cannot be denied. Still, it 
remains a matter of controversy that the work deserves such dedication. 
</P>
<P>
The novelty, at mid-program, was Schumann's handsome concert-piece for four 
horns, here played by a quartet of orchestra members: Gustav Kedves, Dietmar 
Krenz, Charles Putnam and Geoffrey Winter. They cleared all technical hurdles, 
blended neatly in those moments calling for such, and obviously deserved their 
spotlight.

CONCERT: ONCE AGAIN BILLY JOEL, THE CONSUMMATE ENTERTAINER, GIVES HIS FANS A 
GOOD SHOW, BUT HE FAILS TO CHALLENGE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Joel did a shtick early in his show Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena -- the first of five sold-out dates there -- in which he pushed his piano 
stool back with his foot as he played a little rock-a-boogie introduction to 
"Angry Young Man." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the stool was just . . . far . . . enough . . . away that he 
couldn't quite reach it to pull it back. With a little stagy flair he stretched 
with his left hand to try to grab the stool, all the while not missing a note 
with his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there was no real point to this exercise, but it was a nice little 
bit of show. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a pretty good analogy to the nature of Billy Joel the artist. Often 
he has tried to give the impression that he's stretching, reaching, finding new 
vistas. Some examples -- highlights of a nearly 20-year recording career -- 
were presented throughout the two-hour-plus concert Saturday, notably the 
social observation of "Only the Good Die Young," "Allentown," "Out of Saigon" 
and the new, glasnost-inspired "Leningrad." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, though, it's just show. It doesn't add up to much, any more than 
the post-World War II names and places listed in the recent smasheroo "We 
Didn't Start the Fire" add up to anything besides a list. 
</P>
<P>
Ask yourself: Has ever there been a figure in popular music as successful for 
as long as Joel who has left so little impact on the music world? Can you name 
one significant artist whom Joel has influenced? Can you identify any special 
nature to Joel's artistic vision? 
</P>
<P>
But to some extent it's a moot point. "We Didn't Start the Fire" was a smash 
hit, and it brought the crowd (predominant age group: mid-to-late 30s; average 
status, from appearances: comfortable) to its feet. And there's the rub. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been just a show, but it was a really good show. Joel is a 
consummate entertainer, a naturally feisty presence and a born ham. And, most 
important, he knows his fans and plays to them with the best. He just never 
tests them or challenges them. Or stretches them. 
</P>
<P>
He just delivers, on an uncluttered, unobstructed stage, with nifty lighting 
and an accomplished (though musically anonymous, save for ace drummer Liberty 
DeVitto) seven-piece band. He plays most of his many hits, he mugs and clowns, 
he makes engaging hey-I'm-just-a-working-Joe patter. It's very easy to sit back 
and just enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Too easy, and that's the problem, just like the facetious, let-'em-eat-cake 
joke that he closed the evening with: 
</P>
<P>
"If you abso-tively, posi-tootly have to go home," he told the crowd after 
cautioning against drinking and driving, "do what I do. . . . Go in a big 
limousine." 
</P>
<P>
Way too easy.

'WAR AND PIECES' FITFULLY CONSIDERS SOCIETY'S COLLECTIVE DEATH WISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"War and Pieces," at LACE Saturday evening, was a performance art parlor trick: 
Shuffle symbols and pick a meaning, any meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The work of Kraig Grady, Laura McMurray and David Lederer, "War and Pieces" 
deals metaphors and images like a game of 52-card pick-up, in an ambivalent 
search for the meaning of death. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, this "mythic opera of future nostalgia" confronts the collective 
death wish of our apparent desire for environmental suicide. It is all process 
and no resolution, of course, despite the earnestness of the final 
confrontation of character and author -- yes, it's that glib, hip, cynical and 
insecure, all at once -- in a parable of desperate creature and ineffectual 
creator. 
</P>
<P>
The method in the madness of this one-ring circus of the absurd is parody, the 
safe side of seriousness. Representing military-industrial caricatures are 
Aaron Osborne's scene-chewing, Brandoesque Gen. Tequila y Mota and Roger 
Mexico's nerdy science-avatar Neal Cassava. Moderating their conflicts are 
Patti Peck's garish Gypsy Madame Spiral, and a multipurpose chorus of Muses 
dressed like bag-ladies on holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The text -- usually declaimed loudly and none too clearly -- draws heavily on 
Biblical allusions and New Age mythologies. Nothing in this "opera" is sung, 
save one oppressively chanted chorus. 
</P>
<P>
There is strong music in the background, however, taking its cues from the 
text. Using mostly home-made Orff instruments and reed organs, Grady manages to 
enrich the texture of the effort and extend its impact through a few 
acoustically rich, effectively simple chords. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a film as continual backdrop, mirroring the General and Cassava 
at the beginning, then turning to pictures of earth, air, fire and water. It 
adds another dimension to the endearing and deliberate amateurishness of the 
production, but in the end it is only the urgent sincerity of Cassava's 
pleading that belatedly turns "War and Pieces" from an exercise in communal 
solipsism into a pointed acknowledgement of universal conflicts. JOHN HENKEN

ROSS TOMPKINS ENHANCES COLE QUARTET AT VINE ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jam session performances -- those instant, unrehearsed jazz get-togethers -- 
can be very good or very bad. Alto saxophonist Richie Cole's opening-night 
program Thursday of a four-night run at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill fell 
somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, the presence of pianist Ross Tompkins, bassist Chuck 
Berghofer and drummer John Guerin in the rhythm section brought some coherence 
and structure to Cole's spontaneously chosen program of songs. 
</P>
<P>
Tompkins' ability to create instant orchestrations in virtually everything he 
plays was particularly helpful. Cole's peculiar decision, for example, to do "I 
Can't Get Started" as a samba was successful largely because of the pianist's 
structured approach to his accompaniment patterns. On "These Foolish Things," 
Tompkins made the rare choice -- in this era of multi-note improvising -- of 
actually performing a ballad without instantly doubling the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
Cole's playing was more problematic. In the opening few tunes, there was the 
suggestion of an animated interaction between his saxophone and Tompkins' piano 
that boded well for the set. But Cole soon abandoned the more subtle musical 
linkages for detached, up-front, straight-ahead blowing. 
</P>
<P>
His devil-take-the-hindmost technique was his most engaging quality, in part 
because -- on this set, at least -- Cole's usually powerful emotional energy 
seemed to be on slow burn. A high speed romp through "The White Cliffs of 
Dover" best displayed his rapid articulation, and a set of variations on 
Charlie Parker's "My Little Suede Shoes" hinted at the whimsy that can be one 
of Cole's more appealing qualities.DON HECKMAN

LONDON-BASED NASH ENSEMBLE IN LOCAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The good news about the London-based Nash Ensemble -- which takes its name from 
18th-Century English architect John Nash, presumably for the harmoniousness of 
his designs -- has been coming our way for some 20 years via reviews and 
numerous recordings. 
</P>
<P>
In-the-flesh confirmation of the group's virtues arrived on Friday, courtesy of 
the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College, which presented the local 
debut of the four-member core ensemble (the Nash exists in various 
configurations) in the downtown Doheny Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
The curiously structured program opened with what turned out to be the 
evening's most impressive offering: a grandly secure, dramatic, resplendent 
reading by pianist Ian Brown, violinist Marcia Crayford and cellist Christopher 
van Kampen of Beethoven's D-major Trio, the so-called "Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
Until it breaks into a memorably jaunty little samba tune in its finale, 
Milhaud's 1936 Suite for violin, clarinet and piano, which followed, is one of 
those frothy, frisky, familiar (even on first hearing) bits of French fluff 
that bypasses the mind, which is OK, and barely catches the ear, which isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one had to admire Friday's spiffy performance, which centered on the 
agile, bright-toned clarinet of Duncan Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, there were major problems for this listener, if none for the 
performers. In the doggedly downbeat second half of their program, the players 
presented first Faure's meandering, pointless Piano Trio in D minor, Opus 120, 
which displays the exhaustion of a once-great lyric gift, then the tuneless 
convolutions of Brahms' hardly more winning Clarinet Trio in A minor. 
</P>
<P>
The Nash minimized the longueurs of both works with rhythmically alert, 
cohesive, lush-toned execution. One wishes them a speedy return, bearing 
different gifts.HERBERT GLASS

LONG BEACH SYMPHONY DISPLAYS VIRTUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If virtuosity -- like virtue -- is its own reward, the Long Beach Symphony 
seems to be striking it rich this season. 
</P>
<P>
At the orchestra's fifth concert of 1989-90, Saturday night in Terrace Theater 
at the Long Beach Convention Center, music director JoAnn Falletta led a 
satisfying and unhackneyed program that clearly displayed the achievement of 
the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
That program consisted of Beethoven's Violin Concerto, played by concertmaster 
Kathleen Lenski, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's Concerto Grosso (1985) and Respighi's 
"Feste Romane." 
</P>
<P>
Genuine brilliance -- the kind of weighty, full-out orchestral performance that 
cannot be faked or approximated, only achieved -- marked the climactic and 
resourceful performance Falletta &amp; Co. brought to the Respighi pieces. 
Finding all the contrasting quiet places and utilizing to best advantage the 
gifted first-desk players of the ensemble had a lot to do with this success 
too. 
</P>
<P>
There was also great show in the orchestra's account of Zwilich's colorful, 
five-movement essay -- written as an homage to Handel on his 300th anniversary, 
but an unconscious tribute to Bartok and Britten, as well. The Concerto Grosso 
is a work of many resonances, and it sweeps the listener along breathlessly. 
This performance -- which outlined reconciliation as the true emotional and 
musical subject of the piece -- seemed to touch all bases. 
</P>
<P>
To begin any program with a masterpiece is no sin, of course. Still, starting 
this one with the Violin Concerto of Beethoven seemed arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
Lenski's solo performance proved positively immaculate and mechanically 
unassailable but not always stylish or noble: Both she and conductor Falletta 
failed to achieve the rhythmic steadiness that gives the opening movement its 
strength and character, for instance. And a certain standoffishness marked the 
entire performance, which nonetheless moved from beginning to end with 
authority.DANIEL CARIAGA

BACK IN THE FRAY: Tom C. Rogers, above, a slow-growth advocate from San Juan 
Capistrano, has started a statewide group to help defeat Proposition 111, the 
governor's June ballot proposal to increase the gas tax for major road 
improvements. . . . Rogers says he is against the initiative because it tampers 
with state spending limitations put in place by Paul Gann's Proposition 4 in 
1979. . . . It's "misleading," he says, because "you have to read it four times 
before you get the notion that it's a gas tax hike." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve

QUESTION: What's worse than too many Medflies? Answer: Not enough. . . . 
California's entire congressional delegation has signed a letter demanding 
faster production of sterile Medflies at the federal government's Hawaiian 
laboratory. . . . Released in hordes, the sterile flies interfere with normal 
breeding and are an alternative to controversial aerial spraying. . . . A 
federal official said 100 million sterile Medflies will be sent to California 
this week but that full production -- 500 million a week -- won't be achieved 
before October. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

IRVINE CO. PAPER ON COUNCIL DOCKET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new weekly newspaper in town is expected to be the subject of debate at 
tonight's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The debate was set at the last council meeting after Mark Petracca, a political 
science professor at UC Irvine, criticized Tustin Today, a 2-month-old weekly 
newspaper owned by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Petracca demanded that the council protect its use of the name "Tustin Today," 
which for years has been the name of the city's quarterly recreation brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Petracca suggested that the City Council file a complaint with the Fair 
Political Practices Commission because he said the new newspaper "is an attempt 
by the Irvine Co. to build community support for its development and land-use 
agenda in Tustin." As such, he said, it should be disclosed as a political 
expenditure under the Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Earl J. Prescott suggested that the council discuss the matter 
tonight. Councilwoman Ursula E. Kennedy proposed placing the city's other 
weekly newspaper, the Tustin News, on the agenda as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to me that it was an unfair attack on a new newspaper in town," 
Kennedy said. "I'm pretty much of a free enterpriser, so I just thought that 
I'd make sure everybody got represented in this little discussion." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of name protection has become moot, however, because the Irvine Co. 
changed the name of its newspaper to Tustin Weekly in its March 30 edition. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly did not want to usurp any good will or reader franchise from the 
city's publication," said Brien Manning, publisher of Tustin Weekly. Manning 
said Petracca's statements had nothing to do with the decision to change the 
paper's name. 
</P>
<P>
Though the old name is gone, the controversy remains. 
</P>
<P>
"They are in violation of campaign reporting laws," Prescott said. "It's 
sophisticated political pamphleteering." SHANNON SANDS

CITY JOINS PROFITABLE ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<P>
An extra officer will be added to Seal Beach's police force to allow the city 
to join a profitable narcotics suppression program without detracting from its 
current patrol force of 42 officers. 
</P>
<P>
Cities participating in the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, which began 
in 1986, have received an average of $250,000 a year in shared assets seized 
from drug dealers, Capt. Ken Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
He said only four of Orange County's 23 police agencies are not participating 
in the program, which has been responsible for 136 arrests and the seizure of 
more than $57.7 million in cash and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the temporary addition of the new officer, who will 
receive $48,000 annually and will be assigned to the program. City Manager 
Robert Nelson said the Police Department will consider permanently funding the 
position at its mid-year budget review in June. 
</P>
<P>
According to Garrett, within two years "this position will be fully financed by 
our share of assets seized from major narcotics traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
"This project is known on an international basis," Nelson said. "The success of 
the team is proven. There is a chance of gaining funds (by participating). Let 
the drug dealers pay for our officers." MICHELLE NICOLOSI

BURGLARY SUSPECT FOUND ATOP ROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police cordoned off a residential neighborhood early Sunday and used a 
helicopter and dogs to conduct a yard-by-yard search for a suspected auto 
burglar, who was eventually found hiding atop a roof. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Donald Owen McClure, 29, of Newport Beach, was booked on suspicion 
of vehicle tampering, petty theft and assault on a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Karl Schuller said he was on routine patrol at about 1:40 a.m. 
Sunday when he saw the suspect trying to steal the taillight off a car parked 
in the 200 block of East 17th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect struggled as Schuller tried to arrest him, cutting the officer over 
the eye, and fled, Schuller said. Schuller chased the suspect for 500 yards but 
had to give up after twisting his ankle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller was taken to a local hospital, where he was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Other police officers, meanwhile, cordoned off the neighborhood and searched 
for two hours before finding the suspect on a roof. JIM CARLTON

MOTHER HELPS SPUR ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight months ago, Dorothy Hendrickson never would have considered herself a 
community activist. But when a neighbor told her that she saw two fifth-grade 
boys in her son's class buying drugs in their neighborhood, an outraged 
Hendrickson changed. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the mother of three has become the leader of a grass-roots effort 
to get a strong anti-drug and anti-gang program in the Westminster School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The effort paid off when the City Council recently voted to join the district 
in funding the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, better known as DARE, 
in 17 city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally am not willing to lose one of our children to drugs or gangs," 
said Hendrickson, 34, who's children attend Sequoia Elementary School. "This 
program doesn't tell them to say no, it teaches them how to say no." 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson researched various drug programs and selected DARE, which is run by 
the police. Since she brought her proposal to the Sequoia PTA, community 
support has snowballed. More than 100 residents were behind the effort by the 
time Hendrickson brought the idea to the school board and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone got together and decided to do something about drugs and gangs in 
Westminster," Hendrickson said. "These were people from all different walks of 
life who decided to fight this problem together to see if we can bring an end 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to match the $30,000 already pledged by the school district 
in federal grant funds to launch the program and to hire two full-time officers 
to run it. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James Cook said every fifth- and sixth-grader in the city will be 
exposed to the program, which sends two police officers to the schools once a 
week for 17 weeks. The officers teach pupils about the effects of drugs and 
alcohol and how to resist peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"This program can directly impact the children in our community, and we believe 
very strongly in it," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hendrickson is reluctant to take credit for launching the program in 
the district, resident Vera Palomino said, "She started all of this and she 
made it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Palomino, who has children attending L.P. Webber Elementary School, said: "This 
is a problem that has long been overlooked, and it's time for kids to learn the 
truth about what it's like to be on drugs and what drugs do to your mind and 
body." 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson said she also has learned something. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked on this for eight months and talked to hundreds of citizens," 
Hendrickson said. "The thing that has been overwhelming is how many people care 
about our city. I had no idea." GREG HERNANDEZ

CITY MAY BUY SITE FOR ELDERLY HOUSING

The City Council on Tuesday will consider buying property for apartments for 
low-income senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The owner, First Lutheran Church of Fullerton, is willing to sell the 
23,800-square-foot site on East Amerige Avenue for about $750,000, said Terry 
M. Galvin, the city's redevelopment manager. 
</P>
<P>
A few old houses, including a rare two-story Victorian house, and a small 
apartment are on the property now. The city and the church would share the cost 
of finding new homes for current renters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city would try to find someone to buy and move the Victorian house because 
of its historical value, Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider signing an option to buy the property and authorizing 
its staff to find a developer to build the apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton would sell the property at a low price with the condition that rents 
forever be kept affordable to low-income seniors, Galvin said. TOM McQUEENEY

GIRL SCOUTS' CAMP PROJECT NEARS FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A $4.2-million expansion of the Orange County Girl Scouts' camp in the San 
Jacinto Mountains is expected to be finished in May, after five years of work. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of it as the camp that cookies built," said Mona Ware, 
executive director of the council. 
</P>
<P>
Fully $2.7 million of the funds for the camp expansion came from the sale of 
Girl Scout cookies in Orange County over the past five years, Ware said. The 
rest came from a two-year fund-raising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Scherman in Riverside County accommodates 8,500 Girl Scouts and volunteers 
annually of Orange County's 22,000 Girl Scouts and 11,400 adult volunteers, 
making it the most heavily used Girl Scout camp in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The camp, which is being expanded from 560 acres to 700 acres, offers 
everything from "theater in the woods" to survival and forestry protection 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
It is so popular with Girl Scouts, though, that the council has to use a 
lottery system to determine who may attend, Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
"This expansion won't accommodate all the girls that want to come," Ware said, 
"but it will go a long way towards meeting a lot of expectations." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the expansion, the council completed a 101-tent camp site, which 
more than 2,500 girls attend annually. It also added a four-acre lake for 
canoeing, sailing and even windsurfing. Currently, a training center that can 
hold up to 120 adult volunteers is being installed. 
</P>
<P>
The council, headquartered on Adams Avenue in Costa Mesa, is one of largest of 
334 councils nationwide, Ware said. LEON TEEBOOM

HELMET USE URGED AFTER BOY'S DEATH 
</P>

<P>
Bicycle safety programs were tailor-made for rambunctious children such as 
9-year-old Jamie Sides. 
</P>
<P>
Spunky and full of life, Jamie enjoyed running, swimming and teasing his older 
sister. But the energetic youngster loved nothing more than pedaling his bike 
around his Mission Viejo neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, bike safety was the focus at the launching of an ambitious 
Sheriff's Department child safety program at Viejo Elementary School, where 
Jamie and his schoolmates surprised teachers and police by spontaneously 
chanting the sheriff's catchy "Kids Count Too" slogan several times during the 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
But somewhere along La Mancha Street on March 25 around 11 a.m., the lessons he 
learned that day may have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 100 feet from his front door at the corner of La Mancha and Nublado 
streets, Jamie was hit by a van while riding his bike. On Wednesday, he died 
from massive brain trauma suffered when his head struck a curb in front of his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, his father said a helmet could have saved his son's life. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a broken arm, a broken leg and internal injuries," Jim Sides said, "but 
he would have survived that. He died from brain injuries because his head hit a 
curb. Jamie wouldn't have died if he had been wearing a helmet." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, more than a hundred friends, relatives, teachers and 
schoolchildren turned out at the Rancho Capistrano Community Church in San Juan 
Capistrano to pay their last respects to the boy and to speculate on what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have program after program for the kids, but it still can't stop a 
horrible tragedy like this from happening," said Viejo Elementary School 
Principal Dick Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie's death was the second involving a Mission Viejo youngster within a 
two-week period. A week before, a 12-year-old boy was struck and killed by a 
car while walking across Crown Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest accident, what stunned family, friends and others is that the 
47-year-old woman who was driving the van that struck Jamie has two children 
who attended Viejo Elementary with Jamie. 
</P>
<P>
A well-liked PTA mother, her involvement is making the situation as hard to 
handle for parents as for Jamie's classmates, who Campbell said are recovering 
well from the initial shock of the accident. FRANK MESSINA

PACT TO RESTORE OLD THEATER COMING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of negotiations, an agreement to restore and reopen the Fox 
Fullerton Theatre will come before the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the city to build a 200-space parking structure behind 
the Fox in exchange for the owner's spending up to $1.55 million to restore the 
65-year-old theater. 
</P>
<P>
It has been considered a city landmark, and its reopening is part of the city's 
goal of attracting more people downtown in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox closed in a state of disrepair in 1987 and since has sat empty on 
Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner, Edward G. Lewis, an attorney in Hollywood, asked the city last 
year for help in reopening the Fox. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which the council will consider signing after a public hearing 
Tuesday, spells out how the Fox must be restored and what the city will do to 
help the theater reopen. Plans call for the balcony to be walled off and the 
theater converted to two smaller screens. The city will require that murals, 
decorative ceilings, fixtures and the proscenium be restored. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has signed an agreement with Landmark Theatre Corp. of Los Angeles to 
restore and operate the Fox. Landmark has said it will show art and foreign 
films, as well as movies aimed at families. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the city to buy the necessary land behind the theater, 
relocate renters now living there and build a parking structure. The city also 
has plans to buy a closed mortuary nearby to allow better access to the parking 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
The city's cost is estimated at $4.1 million. TOM McQUEENEY

LOAD OF PLATE GLASS FALLS ON GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten tons of plate glass fell off a truck and shattered early this morning on 
the Golden State Freeway near Saugus, causing a three-car collision, at least 
15 flat tires and the closure of the southbound lanes of the freeway for more 
than an hour, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The glass fell from a truck carrying 21 tons of plate glass from Fresno to Los 
Angeles, said Officer Ralph Elvira of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Elvira said the truck, driven by Raul Hinojosa, 55, of Parlier, was traveling 
south on the freeway near Hasley Canyon Road at 4:15 a.m. when it "swerved 
abruptly," causing the glass to slide onto the roadway and shatter. 
</P>
<P>
Three cars collided as they tried to avoid the glass, Elvira said. No one was 
injured in the collisions. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Jodi Ransone said that when she arrived at the scene, 15 vehicles 
with flat tires lined the right shoulder and center divider of the freeway near 
the spilled glass. Elvira said several other motorists called this morning to 
complain about flat tires. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP closed the southbound lanes of the freeway while Department of 
Transportation crews cleaned up the glass. Two lanes were reopened after 5:30 
a.m., Elvira said. The freeway was reopened completely at 8:30 a.m., he said.

Nelson R. Mandela said today he will meet President Frederik W. de Klerk on 
Thursday to discuss ways to end the factional violence among blacks in Natal 
province, and he appealed for an end to the fighting that has kept blacks from 
uniting to fight white minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the African National Conference deputy president, decided to meet De 
Klerk despite the ANC decision to pull out of talks April 11. The ANC canceled 
the meeting because police shot and killed at least nine demonstrators last 
week in the black township of Sebokeng near Johannesburg. The organization said 
it will reconsider entering talks once the government curbs the police.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein today admitted that Iraq has highly advanced chemical 
weapons matched only by the superpowers and threatened to destroy "half of 
Israel" if it attacks his country. 
</P>
<P>
In his first major address since Iraq was accused last week of trying to 
smuggle U.S.-made nuclear triggers through Britain, Hussein denied that Baghdad 
is building an atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to Israel, believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear 
power, Saddam said: "Those who are threatening us with nuclear bombs, we warn 
them that we will hit them with these binary chemical weapons." 
</P>
<P>
"I also say that if Israel dares to hit even one piece of steel on any 
industrial site, we will make the fire eat half of Israel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam claimed that criticism of his country after the incident in Britain was 
intended to intimidate Iraq and "to pave the way for Israel to attack us." 
</P>
<P>
Israel condemned Saddam's comments on chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"It is high time for the civilized world to act in unity and see to it that Mr. 
Saddam Hussein will not have the possibility to pursue his irresponsible and 
criminal designs," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said Israel has "no 
aggressive intention against anyone, including Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a preemptive strike against Iraq to neutralize 
the chemical threat, he said: "We don't even want to talk about that kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli aircraft attacked and damaged a French-built Iraqi nuclear reactor near 
Baghdad in June, 1981. Israel claimed that Iraq was using it to develop nuclear 
weapons. Baghdad denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
British authorities arrested several Iraqis in London last week as they 
allegedly tried to smuggle krytrons, or electronic devices used to trigger 
nuclear weapons, from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In his first public comment on the arrests, Saddam denied claims that Iraq 
intended to use the devices for atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
He said the devices were "only condensers which we bought for $10,500 and it's 
not logical that these could be used in atomic bombs." 
</P>
<P>
But he defended Iraq's right to build unconventional weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"I categorically deny that we have any atomic bombs, but let them (Iraq's 
critics) hear here and now that we do possess binary chemical weapons, which 
only the United States and the Soviet Union also have," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
These weapons contain two relatively safe compounds that are mixed shortly 
before release to create lethal toxic gases. 
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be the first time that the Iraqi leader has admitted that 
his country possesses binary weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein said Iraq acquired binary weapons in the final days of the eight-year 
Persian Gulf war but did not use them against Iran.

U.S. TO PUSH ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT ISSUES

<P>
The Bush Administration said today that it is getting very serious about energy 
conservation and environmental issues and suggested that the programs were 
given short shrift under President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins made the assessment as he released an 
interim report on an energy strategy his department plans to submit to 
President Bush in December. 
</P>
<P>
The 230-page report summarized views expressed in 12,000 pages of testimony 
taken at 15 public hearings that began in August. 
</P>
<P>
The report draws no conclusions, but presents an array of possibilities and 
lists potential obstacles, including objections of industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The loudest single message was to increase energy efficiency in every sector 
of energy use," Watkins said. "Energy efficiency was seen as a way to reduce 
pollution, reduce dependence on oil imports and reduce the cost of energy." 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Watkins said environmental concerns will be a 
significant factor in shaping the final report. 
</P>
<P>
'I don't think the department has been that forthcoming in those areas in the 
past and we are getting very serious about it at the direction of the 
President," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The report calls for examination of strict conservation requirements and 
government-financed development of renewable alternative energy sources such as 
hydroelectric dams and geothermal power. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan stoutly opposed such measures, arguing that energy issues should be left 
to the marketplace. He even advocated doing away with the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in asking for the energy strategy, said, "A keystone of this strategy is 
going to be the continuation of the successful policy of market reliance."

HEART ASSN. TO DISCONTINUE FOOD LABELING PROGRAM 
</P>

<P>
The American Heart Assn., under pressure from the federal government, has 
decided to discontinue a food labeling program designed to help consumers 
quickly identify products considered best for the prevention of heart disease, 
a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The HeartGuide program, an attempt by the heart association to identify and 
label low-fat, low-cholesterol, low-sodium foods, came under attack by the 
federal Food and Drug Administration, which opposes endorsements by 
non-government groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA has made it clear it is against third-party endorsements," Howard 
Lewis, director of health and science news for the heart association, said 
today. "The government's only concern was that they did not like third-party 
organizations entering into an area where they had legal responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis emphasized that only the labeling program will end. Nutrition education 
and other aspects of the program will continue. 
</P>
<P>
The program was launched in January. 
</P>
<P>
HeartGuide was proposed in 1987 as an attempt to uniformly identify foods with 
certain levels of cholesterol, fat and sodium. 
</P>
<P>
The foods were to be identified with a HeartGuide seal of approval -- a heart 
with a check mark -- on the package. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups, such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest, 
expressed concern that consumers would be lulled by the label into believing 
that HeartGuide-approved foods were actually health foods. Those groups also 
complained about the fairness of the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The heart association planned to charge between $15,000 and $600,000 a year to 
companies participating in the program. The fees were to be used for a 
toll-free hot line and nutrition awareness programs, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said independent labs performed the food analyses after companies 
submitted applications to have foods considered. 
</P>
<P>
He said the heart association is encouraged that the FDA plans to overhaul the 
government's labeling program. 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA has stated a commitment now to completely change the way food labeling 
is done in the country and to challenge and get rid of and set standards for 
such claims as low cholesterol, high fiber, 'lite,' things like that," Lewis 
said. "We're very happy that after 17 years, the government will move ahead -- 
17 years after promises to do something about food labeling."

Jane Makim, sister of the Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, today 
accepted substantial undisclosed damages and a public apology from the Daily 
Mirror newspaper over stories suggesting she had an adulterous affair. 
</P>
<P>
The adultery allegations appeared in three stories published in 1988. Two were 
on the front page. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mirror also ran a story that alleged Makim tried to trick her 
estranged husband, Alexander Makim, into signing visa papers so she could take 
their two children to England. The Makims live in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing settlement of Makim's libel action, her lawyer, Andrew Caldecott, 
told Judge Michael Davies at the High Court in London that the allegations were 
untrue.

The jurors who heard the case against John M. Poindexter began deliberations 
today after the judge cautioned them not to consider the "political disputes" 
that characterized much of the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold Greene gave members of the jury a lengthy 
description of the law and their duties, then sent them into the jury room 
shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would not sequester the panel and ordered deliberations to 
continue daily, from 9:45 a.m. to 5 p.m., until a verdict was reached. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not your function," Greene said, to judge the intense "political 
disputes" that characterized so many aspects of the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The judge told jurors not to consider "who was right and who was wrong between 
Congress and the White House," whether President Ronald Reagan was correct or 
wrong in his staunch support of the rebel Nicaraguan Contras, or whether his 
arms deals with Iran constituted "a wise or unwise policy." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not for judges and jurors to decide," Greene said. Those issues are 
reserved solely for America's elected representatives, the judge said, and 
ultimately the people who elect them. 
</P>
<P>
Greene also told the jury that it is not a proper defense to decide that 
Poindexter acted on direct or indirect instructions from Reagan to violate the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Greene said, Reagan denied during videotaped testimony that he 
ever authorized any aides to break the law -- and Poindexter also maintained 
that he always obeyed the law. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter did not take the stand to defend himself. The judge cautioned the 
jurors that Poindexter exercised his "absolute right" and they could draw no 
inference of guilt from the fact. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, 53, the last of the original Iran-Contra defendants, is the highest 
Reagan Administration official to stand trial in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The retired Navy rear admiral is accused of five felonies involving obstruction 
of Congress, conspiracy and the destruction of official government documents. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all five counts, Poindexter faces up to 25 years in prison and 
$1.25 million in fines. But no other Iran-Contra figure who has pleaded guilty 
or has been convicted by a jury has been sentenced to a day behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
As the judge gave his instructions to the jury, Poindexter appeared as cool and 
calm as he has since jury selection began on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Greene told its members to 
select a "foreperson" and to communicate with the court only by notes signed by 
the group's leader.

Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca today urged nearly 100 top company managers 
to buy Chrysler stock in order to give them more of a direct personal stake in 
the auto maker's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said the executives were being asked to spend up 
to a "certain percentage" of their salary on shares in the No. 3 auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to name that percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Automotive News, a trade publication, called the program unprecedented in the 
auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory essentially is that, as a matter of company policy, you like to 
have top people in the company have an even more vested interest in the 
performance of the company and its future," Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
While the move follows a significant drop in the value of Chrysler stock -- 37% 
from its 52-week high according to Automotive News -- Houston insisted that the 
two developments are not connected.

JUSTICES BACK AUTO MAKERS IN AIR BAG SUITS

<P>
The Supreme Court today let stand rulings that protect automobile manufacturers 
from design-defect lawsuits for not installing air bags. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, refused to revive three such suits against 
General Motors, one against Honda and one against Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
Three federal appeals courts and a California state court ruled in favor of the 
car makers. 
</P>
<P>
The lower courts relied on federal safety laws that until 1986 did not require 
any type of passive restraints and now give manufacturers the option of 
installing air bags or automatic seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
The issue in each of the four appeals was whether the federal safety laws 
preempt product liability suits when the alleged design defect -- the lack of 
an air bag -- does not violate federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
The justices in 1987 refused to order the government to adopt tougher standards 
for installing air bags or automatic seat belts in new cars. 
</P>
<P>
Then-Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole adopted a so-called 
passive restraint rule in 1984 that phased in the use of air bags or seat belts 
that automatically wrap around front-seat occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Car makers were required to equip 10% of their 1987 models with such devices. 
The percentage was gradually increased, and all 1990 model cars are required to 
have dashboard air bags, at least on the driver's side, or automatic seat 
belts. 
</P>
<P>
In the cases acted on today, the justices were told that thousands of 
design-defect suits are pending against car makers, "over a hundred of which 
involve claims concerning passive restraints." 
</P>
<P>
"The preemption issue has been raised or is lurking in every one of them," the 
court was told. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts resident Patricia Wood sued GM after being left a quadriplegic 
from a May 19, 1981, accident. The 1976 GM Blazer in which she was a passenger 
struck a tree. She was not wearing a seat belt. The U.S. 1st Circuit Court of 
Appeals threw out her suit last December. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Meier's family sued Nissan Motor Corp. in California four years ago 
after he was killed in a crash of his 1982 Nissan Stanza. A state appeals court 
dismissed the suit last May. 
</P>
<P>
Suits against auto makers were also filed in New Mexico and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the justices for its views in the Massachusetts case, the Bush 
Administration said Wood's appeal should be rejected.

The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling that airlines say could make it 
more difficult for them to merge. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, refused to shield Delta Air Lines from binding 
arbitration that could lead to a monetary damages award for a flight attendants 
union. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from Delta's acquisition of Western Airlines in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Western agreed in 1984 that, should it merge, the Assn. of Flight Attendants 
would continue to represent Western employees in any newly formed company. 
</P>
<P>
Delta's flight attendants were not unionized, and Delta did not honor Western's 
union contract. The union sought arbitration to retain its status as bargaining 
agent or to win a damage award. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge threw out the union's complaint. But the U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals here reinstated it last July. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry groups said the appeals court decision "creates uncertainty 
and unpredictability" for the future of mergers.

Construction spending rose 2.6% in February, the government said today, as 
unusually warm weather continued across much of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government 
construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $436.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
That compared with a revised 2.5% gain the previous month, the warmest January 
on record. January spending was first reported last month to have rise 1.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Spending in December, the fourth-coldest since the government began keeping 
records 96 years ago, had slipped 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The total construction spending figure was up 4.8% from the level of building a 
year ago.

About 800 actors, dancers and comedians attended a luncheon in Beverly Hills to 
honor Sammy Davis Jr. for his contribution to the world of dance. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 64, whose condition was diagnosed as cancer in September, 1989, was 
unable to attend and is recuperating at home. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Altovise, on Sunday accepted the annual Gypsy Award from the 
Professional Dancers Society on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still a gypsy at heart and of all the tributes that Sammy has received 
this is the one he would have really liked to be at," said Altovise, a former 
dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending were Patrick Swayze, Debbie Allen, Milton Berle, Janet 
Leigh, Nancy Sinatra Jr., Ken Berry and the Nicholas Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The event featured footage of Davis' career from vaudeville to the Las Vegas 
stage to Hollywood films.

MARGAUX BARES ALL TO GET HOLLYWOOD'S ATTENTION

<TEXT>
<P>
Life in the fast lane destroyed Margaux Hemingway's film career just as it was 
getting under way a decade ago, but now, at 35, the granddaughter of the late, 
great author says she is ready to come back. 
</P>
<P>
And the best way to get Hollywood's attention, she figured, was to pose nude. 
</P>
<P>
The model-actress is featured in Playboy's current edition. If nothing else, 
she proved she is in great shape. 
</P>
<P>
She insists that everything else is in order too, claiming victory in her 
battle against alcohol and cocaine dependencies. 
</P>
<P>
Hemingway was a giddy 19-year-old when she burst on the national scene as an 
ingenue in "Lipstick." The movie was terrible, but she captured the country's 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
A fresh-faced, outdoor girl from Ketchum, Ida., Hemingway was a delightfully 
candid, naive newcomer whose love of life catapulted her into celebrity. She 
adorned the cover of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this was Ernest Hemingway's granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
She signed a $1-million contract to promote a perfume and toured the world. She 
made movies -- "Killer Fish," "A Fistful of Chopsticks" and "Over the Brooklyn 
Bridge" -- none of which was very good. 
</P>
<P>
She was married and divorced twice, moving her home from New York to Venezuela 
to Paris and leading a fast-paced life that was going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Her second marriage -- to Venezuelan documentary film producer Bernard Foucher 
-- finally hit the rocks, and Hemingway all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 1/2 years ago she spent a month in the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho 
Mirage, Calif., and has been sober since. She also lost 75 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Last year she completed a movie in Paris, "Love in C Minor," and hopes it will 
lead to a revived acting career in Hollywood, where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm single and in charge of my own life for the first time," she said. "It's a 
marvelous feeling."

Dozens of angry people pounded on the doors of the Prado Museum early today in 
a futile attempt to get into a wildly popular exhibition of Diego Velazquez 
paintings, which just ended its two-month run. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 people flocked to the exhibition after it opened Jan. 24, 
lining up several hours to see 80 paintings by the 17th-Century Spanish master. 
</P>
<P>
It was billed as the most complete Velazquez retrospective ever held. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials said they were forced to reopen the exhibition to latecomers 
twice Sunday night. This followed a public pledge by the museum's director that 
the show would not close until the last visitor had gone away. 
</P>
<P>
But about 40 people were turned away shortly after midnight, despite banging on 
the door and chanting "We want in!" 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition featured such works as "Las Meninas," "The Forge of Vulcan," 
"The Spinners," "The Rokeby Venus," and "The Portrait of Juan de Pareja."

SYLVIA SIDNEY AILING: Screen star of yesteryear Sylvia Sidney, 79, is in 
intensive care in serious condition in a Connecticut hospital, according to 
doctors. Her nephew, Dr. Albert Sabin, who found a vaccine for polio, has been 
at her bedside. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney, star of countless films and co-star to such stars as James Cagney and 
Humphrey Bogart, has been in the hospital since last Sunday suffering from 
pneumonia. She had been on a cruise to the Caribbean and returned to her New 
York apartment before she became ill and was taken to the hospital, where she 
fell into a coma. She awoke on Thursday to face Dr. Sabin. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my God," said Sidney. "I haven't seen you in years. Let's have some 
champagne." Dr. Sabin had champagne brought in and allowed some of it to touch 
Sidney's lips. Then she fell asleep.

O'DWYER BACK IN POLITICS: Paul O'Dwyer, who'll be 83 in June, will be the

"I hope that I'll encourage people not to retire but to stay active," O'Dwyer

</P>
<P>
O'Dwyer, younger brother of the late Mayor William O'Dwyer, served as City 
Council president 16 years ago. During his legal career, he often went to bat 
for unpopular causes and minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exciting time for me because I helped most of the nations now 
emerging independently on their own," O'Dwyer said. "Now I'll be greeting their 
leaders as they come to New York." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's post is still held by Gilliam Sorenson, wife of former John 
F. Kennedy speech writer Ted Sorenson. Gilliam will most likely go to work for 
a U.N. agency.

starting at a small theater and going through revisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Annie 2," you'll recall, was put on the stage by Martin Charnin and Charles 
Strouse in Washington, bound for Broadway. It opened in Washington in January 
and bombed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the author of "Annie," who penned "Annie 2," Tom Meehan, said it's back 
and starts casting again April 23. Only this time it'll be done without Dorothy 
Loudon, who gambled on it in Washington, and they've even ordered a new Sandy, 
the pooch. The dog used to play Sandy in the sequel got his walking papers. But 
Harve Presnell (Daddy Warbucks) and Maryann Seldes (Mrs. Christmas) agreed to 
stay with the show, which will open at the Norman Terris Theatre in Chester, 
Conn., in May for eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
HERE AND THERE: There's no telling about taste. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was asked 
about broccoli in view of the presidential edict that there won't be any 
broccoli served on Air Force One. He said, "I'm for broccoli, cauliflower and 
escarole. Very big on escarole." . . . The TV film "Law and Order" was being 
filmed on the steps of New York's Supreme Court the other morning and Michael 
Moriarty was playing the role of the Manhattan district attorney being mobbed 
by reporters. The scene caused quite a stir and caught the attention of 
Assistant Dist. Atty. John F. Kennedy Jr., who stopped to watch the scene 
played out. Then, it was back to work.

The players signed were safety James Griffin from Detroit, running back Kevin 
Harmon and tight end Rod Jones from Seattle, center Mike Morris from New 
England, wide receiver Timmie Ware from the Raiders, cornerback Charles 
Washington from Indianapolis, tackle Rob Woods from Cincinnati and kicker Bjorn 
Nittmo from the New York Giants.

IT'S ON AGAIN: 27-MAN ROSTERS OPEN SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Baseball teams and players reversed course again today and decided to expand 
rosters to 27 players for the first three weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The sides reached a verbal agreement to expand rosters on March 19, the day 
they agreed to a new four-year labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
But the roster deal collapsed last week when they couldn't agree on how it 
would affect outright assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Teams will have to reduce to the normal minimum of 24 players and maximum of 25 
on May 1. A proposed change that would have lowered the five-inning requirement 
for starters to get a victory was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Weiner, a lawyer for the union, said the outline for the agreement was 
made over the weekend in telephone conversations between union head Donald Fehr 
and Deputy Commissioner Stephen Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Fehr and I are pleased that both sides could reach an agreement on an 
issue of such significance to the players, managers and fans," Chuck O'Connor, 
the owners' chief negotiator, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Teams will designate up to three additional players to management's Player 
Relations Committee, which will inform the union of the names. The identities 
of those players will not be made known to players, agents or other teams. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, players sent outright to the minors for a second time, or players 
with more than three years of major league service sent outright for the first 
time, can elect to become free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Under today's agreement, the union will allow teams to request advance waivers 
through Sunday and ask additional players to agree to waive their right to free 
agency if they are sent to the minors outright. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the first outright, it still counts as the first outright," Weiner 
said.

Veteran Central Washington University basketball Coach Dean Nicholson resigned 
today after an internal review found that some money raised through basketball 
camps was improperly given to student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, 63, has coached at Central Washington for 26 years and is one of 
only 17 college coaches to reach 600 lifetime victories. He said his 
resignation as coach and as a professor of physical education was effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous whistle-blower had complained that income generated by a 
basketball camp was distributed to student athletes at Central in violation of 
state and federal regulations, the university said in a news release.

VOICE OF RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE ACKNOWLEDGES ABORTION AT 21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susan Carpenter McMillan was behind enemy lines and her battle was lost. She 
was hissed and booed for describing abortion as America's holocaust. One man 
marched out. A professor's appeal for deference did little but reduce the 
Valley College audience to polite fidgeting. 
</P>
<P>
Later, McMillan discussed the cost of being spokeswoman for a view that one 
1989 survey showed is held by less than 15% of America women: that abortion 
should not be a legal choice, not even for victims of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm loved by no one and hated by everyone," said McMillan, media 
representative for the Right to Life League of Southern California. "I'm not 
conservative enough for the right wing. God knows, I'm not liberal enough for 
the left wing. I'm married to a Catholic and I'm a Protestant. I'm a feminist 
who is pro-life. 
</P>
<P>
"So I manage to piss off everyone." 
</P>
<P>
And as a rich, crisp, stylish, sometimes sarcastic and always emotional voice 
for one side of a volatile, even violent, international issue, Susan Carpenter 
McMillan also has managed to attract more suggestions of scandal than a 
Presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
A persistent rumor has been that McMillan -- who has spent a decade preaching 
that abortion must be considered illegal, immoral and infanticide -- actually 
had an abortion as a young woman. She has never responded to the gossip. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, in a series of interviews with The Times, McMillan acknowledged 
that she had an abortion in 1970 while an unmarried drama student at USC. 
</P>
<P>
It was an experience, she said, that she tried handling by "complete denial" 
for 13 years. "I faced it seven years ago when I was talking in my office with 
another woman who had an abortion. She was crying and talking about it and it 
just kind of flew out of my mouth . . . and I said, I mean I can't remember 
what I said . . . but I suddenly was saying something I hadn't said in 13 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that 1983 confession, McMillan said her abortion remained a 20-year 
secret kept from her family, friends and league workers. Because, she 
explained, it was a private moment decades ago, which she presumed was buried 
too deep for detection. 
</P>
<P>
In addition: "It was my own private life and I don't consider myself a public 
figure. You can go through 13 years of absolute denial to the point where you 
don't even remember the fact, hardly, that you ever had an abortion. Oh, you 
know you've had it. But you don't know anything else. 
</P>
<P>
But the minute some journalist looks at you and says: 'Have you had an 
abortion?' . . . you have to say: 'Yes.' 
</P>
<P>
"And then somebody asks you what do you feel like and what does that do to you 
. . . and you have to relive it . . . and you, emotionally, abort all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
McMillan also said that in 1983, three years into her work as an anti-abortion 
activist, she underwent a "therapeutic abortion" for a failing pregnancy at 
Glendale Memorial Hospital. This was after her marriage to San Marino lawyer 
William N. McMillan III and the birth of their eldest daughter, now 11, but 
before the birth of their youngest child, 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know that that (a therapeutic abortion) was happening to me," 
she recalled. "I was bleeding with sacs of blood and everything else . . . the 
doctor said I was losing the baby, the baby was deteriorating, and they had to 
go in and have a D and C (dilatation and curettage)." 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, McMillan said, she had problems with another pregnancy. This 
time, she saw any termination as a possible conflict with her beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember talking to some of my friends in the movement afterwards (after the 
earlier therapeutic abortion), thinking that (it) wasn't really the right thing 
for me to do," she continued. "So the next time -- I was about four, 
four-and-a-half months pregnant -- when they said they were going to take me in 
for a D and C. I said: 'No you're not. I'll lay here in labor. It is my body.' 
</P>
<P>
"And I lay there over 20 hours. She (the baby) was dead . . . very, very 
deformed." 
</P>
<P>
McMillan, 42, has carried the message of the Right to Life League and her 
California chapter of Feminists for Life from full debates on national talk 
shows to 75-word sound bites on Los Angeles radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
She does 250 media interviews a year. Her name is filed under "A" for Abortion 
and "W" for Women and "D" for Death Penalty in most reporters' Rolodexes. 
</P>

of Idaho's tough new abortion legislation: Call Susan Carpenter McMillan.

Robert Harris: Interview Carpenter McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
For an articulate talk show guest with an interesting stand on the U.S. Supreme 
Court's consideration of a right-to-die petition: See if McMillan is available. 
</P>
<P>
But will she resign from this public work knowing that her abortion history may 
be seen as a contradiction of her anti-abortion statements? 
</P>
<P>
"Never," McMillan said. "This (abortion) happened 20 years ago. I will never 
resign. Never. This movement is my life and I think what you are looking at is 
a prime example of what abortion does to women." 
</P>
<P>
And what is that? 
</P>
<P>
"I think that women that deal with it and confront it . . . realize that they 
will never be the same. They are never completely whole again. You can't hire a 
hit man to go into your body and crush the skull of your child and . . . have 
it ripped from your body and mangled . . . and expect to be just normal again." 
</P>
<P>
Presumably that was not what she told herself 20 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose you tell yourself that it (an aborted fetus) is tissue and that you 
were right. But the reality is that every woman knows that is a lie. That it is 
your baby you are asking to have killed. Every woman who ever enters an 
abortion clinic knows she is taking the life of a human being." 
</P>
<P>
McMillan declined to discuss the relationship that led to her 1970 pregnancy 
except to say it was a long-term romance. Nor would she discuss her reason for 
choosing abortion over adoption or marriage to the father of the unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
But in an earlier interview, McMillan said that in her youth she carried no 
religious or emotional opposition to abortion "because I believed strongly in 
the woman's movement." 
</P>
<P>
Will McMillan's disclosure of once choosing abortion, now make a lie of her 10 
years spent commenting against it? 
</P>
<P>
"No. No. No." 
</P>
<P>
Will her past negate anti-abortion advice she now delivers to today's young 
people? 
</P>
<P>
"No," McMillan snapped and she was crying. She said this had been the worst day 
of her life. A member of Pasadena's Lake Avenue Congregational Church, she had 
spent most of it discussing her abortion admission with her minister and a 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
Then what might be her advice to young people? 
</P>
<P>
"That I have been there . . . I have walked down that (abortion) path. You can 
look at me and I am a walking example of pro-choice. This is what it does to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
McMillan -- Susie to just about anyone who has known her for more than an hour 
-- has no intention of letting her revelations interfere with her work. 
</P>
<P>
The morning after revealing her past she was on a flight to Lincoln to make a 
presentation in the Nebraska state Capitol. Then she was issuing a press 
release urging anti-abortion supporters to boycott a boycott -- by buying Idaho 
potatoes for delivery to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But within herself she goes "into hibernation, a slump when these things come 
up." In the past, McMillan said, it was whispered that she had bilked the 
league by using its funds to pay for first-class air travel to Oslo and a 
series of speaking engagements last year. Those expenses, she explained, were 
actually paid by her and the Norwegian sponsors of her visit. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she said, "I've heard that I've given a child up for adoption . . . and 
I've heard people say: 'Oh, she's probably having an affair with the senator' 
because I'd be up meeting with someone in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
After the cocktail party gossip concerning her alleged misuse of league money, 
"I cried for three days. I broke out in red blotches. At these times in my life 
I think: 'Hells bells, why am I in this?' There are times, sitting here with 
you, knowing that these things are going to come out, that you do want to get 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll go back (home) and look at my newspaper. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It is an old newspaper, a 1983 periodical published by the Pro-Life Medical 
Assn. It shows a fetus in pieces. The caption reads: "Baby Boy, unnamed, 
Coroner's case 82 -1901-1, weight after abortion, 900 grams. Age 27-29 weeks. 
Cause of death: Dismemberment by Dr. . . . now doing business in Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll look at that and pull myself up and go on," McMillan said. "But inside 
this very tough woman is a very sensitive woman and it (accusation) hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Toughness. It's a quality that even McMillan's critics applaud. 
</P>
<P>
Determination rooted in dedication to the issue. It's a strength that attorney 
and abortion-rights advocate Gloria Allred finds in the woman she considers "an 
interesting adversary. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy debating Susan," Allred said. "She is one of the best, one of the more 
formidable advocates they (anti-abortion groups) have. She is very bright, 
clever and articulate and politically very astute. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I completely disagree with her position and especially that you can 
be a feminist and anti-choice, a complete contradiction in terms." 
</P>
<P>
McMillan is a rich woman. She and her husband live in a multimillion-dollar, 
6,600-square-foot home on one acre of San Marino. It is built on what used to 
be the Winchell (as in doughnuts) Estate. That's across from the Pillsbury (as 
in Doughboy) Estate. 
</P>
<P>
McMillan drives to inner-city anti-abortion meetings in her Mercedes 380SL. She 
wears a gold Rolex and a diamond ring that is "one carat for every year I 
helped put my husband through law school." 
</P>
<P>
But McMillan says she makes no apologies for her husband's success, will not 
wear jeans to her public presentations and although "the last thing I'm there 
(in the inner city) to do is offend . . . I am not going to have a wardrobe for 
the poor." 
</P>
<P>
That, in the opinion of KTLA Channel 5 reporter Marta Waller, reveals McMillan 
as somewhat unsophisticated and a little naive. "Even I don't wear red and blue 
in Compton," said Waller, referring to gang colors. 
</P>
<P>
"So there is an aberration," continued the reporter who has frequently 
interviewed McMillan. "But the trappings of society . . . it's tough to put 
them aside. I understand grinding poverty. I don't know if she can relate to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"But Susie definitely is someone I would go and have lunch with. She's honest, 
a straight shooter. She has taken a stand on an important topic and has not 
backed down and I have a lot of respect for her courage." 
</P>
<P>
Where that resolve cames from is not something that McMillan easily pins down. 
</P>
<P>
Her belief in the guidance of God may have come from the Church of the 
Foursquare Gospel where she worshipped as a child -- and from a mother who was 
ordained by the controversial founder of that church, revivalist Aimee Semple 
McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, the late Charles Carpenter, a California land developer, could have 
sparked her concern for community issues. Carpenter often visited Skid Row with 
money and food for the homeless. He would take his daughter with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go down to the Union Rescue Mission with him and watch him hold the 
hands of people who would vomit on him," she remembered. "He brought troubled 
people into our home. He'd pray with them and I had tremendous admiration for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
From marriage and discussions with her lawyer husband, says McMillan, came an 
opposition to capital punishment and, in fact, any taking of human life. Except 
in defense of one's own life. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the abortion at 21 shaped her future. Subconsciously, she says. The 
conscious catalyst, she believes, arose in 1977 with a $16 examination at a Los 
Angeles clinic. 
</P>
<P>
McMillan, five years married, was told she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want children, ever," she remembered. "When we got married, I told 
Bill: 'No children.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a crisis. We had no money. None. Except for my (department store) 
paycheck. My husband wasn't working. I'd bought this home thinking he was going 
to pass the bar right away, but he didn't pass the bar the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no emotional attachment to the unborn. But suddenly, in my tissue . . . 
I couldn't believe I was pregnant. And I just went to pieces. I walked 
downstairs to book my abortion but I was crying so hard by the time I got there 
I couldn't book it." 
</P>
<P>
The vehemence of her reactions surprised McMillan. So she explored her 
responses. She looked through a first semester biology book. There were 
pictures of fetal development. "I saw a human life looking back at me . . . I 
saw my baby." 
</P>
<P>
A daughter was born. So was an activist. 
</P>
<P>
She and the league objected in 1986 when Loma Linda University Medical Center 
-- citing an unstable relationship between parents -- refused to consider a 
desperately ill infant as a potential heart transplant recipient. McMillan 
prevailed and Baby Jesse, now almost 4, became a household name. 
</P>
<P>
She and the league intervened in 1988 when a state agency denied funds for a 
liver transplant for a 5-year-old boy, a Mexican national. McMillan won again 
and the boy survives. 
</P>
<P>
She states her opinions plainly: 
</P>
<P>
* On capital punishment: "Lock the sucker up and don't ever let him out but 
don't kill him. They (convicted murderers) are animals. But kill them and you 
become the animal they are." 
</P>
<P>
* On abortion for victims of rape or incest: "We can't make exceptions for any 
of those. It is still (taking) a human life and if you make one exception then 
you make all exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
* On abortion to save the life of the mother: "I'm saying that (a mother) has a 
right to defend her life. . . . Then the woman has the right to say: 'I'm going 
to take the life of this little aggressor even though it is an innocent 
aggressor.' " 
</P>
<P>
* On abortion of a deformed fetus: "(No.) Suddenly, I guess God took the day 
off and you decided who shall live and who shall die." 
</P>
<P>
* On the right of people on life-support systems to die: "You do all that you 
can to save life and to comfort life and to make it easy. And when the plug 
needs to be pulled, you pull the plug. But you do not starve people to death 
who are not dying." 
</P>
<P>
* On abortion in extreme cases of poverty or other family hardship: "What would 
you say to a mother who had tuberculosis and a father who had syphilis and the 
first child was blind? The second child had tuberculosis and the third child 
was mentally retarded? And now she's pregnant again. What would you do? 
Everybody says: 'I'd abort.' Well, you just aborted Beethoven." 
</P>
<P>
* On the abortion pill: "It's a human pesticide." 
</P>
<P>
Critical remarks rise regularly against such statements and the woman who makes 
them. Said Beverly Hills lawyer Edward Tabash, of the California Abortion 
Rights Action League: "I see her as a traitor to her gender because of what 
will happen to the women in this country if her work results in any change to 
this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Commented Allred: "She has an elitist, upper-middle-class, unrealistic view of 
the world. She has memorized the hot buttons and the buzzwords." Other 
detractors suggest that McMillan is more enamored of the limelight than the 
issue. "They sound like quotes from anti-lifers who think I'm very effective," 
McMillan countered. "And I am very effective because I believe in what I'm 
doing. With an unbelievable passion. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I was doing this for the cameras, I durned well would have chosen an 
issue that is a lot more popular." 
</P>
<P>
It almost is certain that with disclosure of her 1970 abortion, Susan Carpenter 
McMillan faces tougher questions and heftier criticism. 
</P>
<P>
She says she is ready. 
</P>
<P>
She does not want to speculate on what her life might have been had she decided 
against the abortion. But she says she has thought about that decision 
"probably every day for the last seven years. . . . I probably would have been 
able to look at a beautiful 20-year-old child today. And thank God that I had 
not killed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I've gone through this week in my life . . . so I think having a 
baby would have been a lot easier than facing that I murdered a child. So, I 
guess . . . I'd give up everything I have today to reverse the decision that I 
made 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
McMillan recalls the moment clearly. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at that doctor and I said to him: 'Is this (fetus) a baby?' And he 
laughed in my face and said: 'Oh, honey, it is just a cluster of cells.' 
</P>
<P>
"Every woman knows better, but you want to believe that you're not going to be 
lied to. And the bottom line is, you are lied to. And so I went ahead." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, McMillan broke news of her past to key members of her 
league. The response, she said, was support and understanding, flowers and 
hugs. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day she flew to Nebraska with a new realization. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there is no vulnerable spot in my life, no weakness in my armor. And, of 
course, I guess there never has been. 
</P>
<P>
"But for many years I sat and listened to Gloria Allred and people talk about 
their abortion, and rant and rave and carry on, and I've sat there quietly 
thinking: 'I could defuse everything you're saying.' But I just sat there and 
never said a word." 
</P>
<P>
And in Nebraska, McMillan said a few words. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter asked her how could she relate to a young woman considering 
abortion? 
</P>
<P>
"And I said: 'Because when I was 21 I went through it.' And all of a sudden he 
looked at me and said: 'Oh, dear, I'm sorry for that question.' And then he 
said: 'But what a powerful tool you have. . . . ' "

<TEXT>
<P>
Everett Reiten was a man of few words and even fewer revelations. When his 
family found out shortly before his death last year at age 92 that the retired 
Long Beach stockbroker had a fortune worth as much as $16 million, the news 
came from a network television show, not Reiten. 
</P>
<P>
So little did the hermit-like old man have to do with his millions that he 
spent more than 50 years in Long Beach without owning so much as a car, 
repeatedly wore the same nondescript clothes stuffed full of papers and 
apparently lived for a time in a department store stockroom. 
</P>
<P>
He took the bus from Southern California when he returned for the last time to 
his tiny hometown in rural Wisconsin at the age of 85 and spent his final years 
living with his elderly sister and her husband in a cluttered old house without 
a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Devoted to thrift and Howard Hughes-like secrecy, Reiten's life became the 
stuff of court documents after he died without a will last summer. The riches 
he amassed with the help of painful frugality and stock in pet food will pass 
to relatives he wouldn't even let into his rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The 89-year-old sister and middle-aged nephew who will inherit Reiten's fortune 
seem no more prepared to transform their simple lives with money than did 
Reiten. With millions coming her way, the sister still doesn't have a 
telephone. The nephew, who declined to be interviewed, told an investigator 
that beyond seeing a tax accountant, he didn't have any particular plans for 
the money and would continue building a house for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reiten's former Long Beach stockbroker, Willard R. Walls Jr., stands 
accused of taking advantage of his client's seeming indifference to wealth and 
is scheduled to stand trial this week in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. He 
has been indicted on a variety of federal charges alleging that he diverted 
more than $400,000 from Reiten's accounts. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it took private investigators and the Orange County Public 
Guardian's Office to prove that Reiten had achieved the pre-World War II 
Midwesterner's dream of striking it rich in the golden light of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Reiten was a quiet loner who hated being photographed, never married and had no 
known children. His only two known addresses during a half a century in Long 
Beach were a now-demolished hotel on Ocean Boulevard and the downtown office 
building where he worked for years as a stockbroker for a small Los 
Angeles-based firm. He stayed so late in the office that people in the building 
suspected that he lived there. Later Reiten told a stockbroker who handled one 
of his accounts that he spent his nights in a storeroom in the old Buffum's 
department store downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how he made so much money. He didn't have any personality," said 
Charles C. Dodds, who for decades ran a barber shop on the same floor as 
Reiten's office. Dodds remembers that Reiten didn't even look like a 
stockbroker, much less a successful one. 
</P>
<P>
In the small circle of Long Beach stockbrokers in the 1940s and '50s, there was 
nothing extraordinary about Everett Reiten. "I would have thought he had 
$15,000 or $16,000, not $16 million," mused Calvert Strong, a stockbroker who 
also worked in Reiten's building. 
</P>
<P>
A small man, Reiten walked around in his later years with The Wall Street 
Journal or a bundle of financial papers stuffed inside his shirt or coat. 
</P>
<P>
However unimpressive his persona, Reiten knew the stock market. Thomas Fagan, a 
retired stockbroker who handled an account for Reiten at Paine Webber in the 
1960s and 1970s, describes Reiten as very private, intelligent and extremely 
knowledgeable about stocks -- even though Reiten never told Fagan that he had 
been a stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Reiten identified himself as an engineer or geologist from Minnesota. 
He also kept strict tabs on his $200,000 to $300,000 account, telling Fagan 
exactly what to invest in and always sticking to conservative investments. 
Later, Reiten benefited enormously from the not-so-conservative portfolio 
management of Walls, the retired Long Beach stockbroker who is accused of 
swindling Reiten. Reiten's major stock holdings, heavy with Ralston Purina 
shares, tripled in value in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the months preceding his death last August, Reiten could rattle off 
stock figures. "He was very alert and with it to the end," said Donna Goetsch, 
a nurse at the Ashland, Wis., nursing home where Reiten spent the last 18 
months of his life. "I was quite amazed to hear this elderly gentleman go on 
and on about his stocks." 
</P>
<P>
Reiten told orderlies that he was a millionaire, according to Goetsch, and he 
paid the $22,000-a-year nursing home bill. But "he didn't like to spend money; 
that was real evident," she said. If Goetsch asked Reiten if he wanted new 
clothes, he would respond, "I'm fine with what I have; no need to spend money." 
Reiten once complained to her that a long-distance caller should have saved the 
money and written. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Goetsch said Reiten "was rather liked by the staff. He was a 
cantankerous old man, but he was kind of cute." 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1982 that Reiten closed the circle of his life by moving back to 
Bayfield, Wis., a simple village of about 800 people on a scenic stretch of 
Lake Superior. He rented the upstairs rooms in his sister Nancy's home, across 
the cobblestone street from the house where he had been born to Scandinavian 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Ole, was a saloon keeper who died at age 34 from internal injuries 
caused by heavy lifting. Reiten, the second of four children, was 4 at the 
time. His mother, Hulda, then married Ole's younger brother, who died a few 
years later of a heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
Reiten never finished high school but studied economics at the University of 
Wisconsin. He was in the Army during World War I, worked in Chicago and in 1930 
joined the migration to Long Beach, so favored by transplanted Midwesterners 
that it came to be known as "Iowa by the sea." 
</P>
<P>
He wrote home and sometimes visited, always taking the bus. Only once did he 
fly, when his mother died. He told his relatives little about his work, and 
they inevitably described him as a man who kept to himself. 
</P>
<P>
When one of Reiten's nephews visited him in Long Beach in the 1960s, Reiten 
wouldn't let him into his room at the Admiral Hotel, always insisting that they 
meet downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
At his sister's, Reiten stayed in his upstairs apartment with the doors locked 
most of the time, rarely speaking to family members, sleeping during the day 
and tending to his papers at night. He would emerge for meals with Nancy, his 
only living sibling, and to make calls at a nearby phone booth, according to 
Phil Wigley, a retired Huntington Beach police detective who works for an 
Orange County detective agency hired by the public guardian to verify Reiten's 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
One day in 1988, when Reiten had not been heard from, Nancy peered into his 
apartment and found him lying on the floor with a broken arm. The lock had to 
be cut from his door to get him out. When a physician examined Reiten, who was 
unkempt and dirty, he found $1,800 in Reiten's underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Reiten was admitted to the nursing home, and it was while he was there that 
questions surfaced about the handling of his fat stock portfolio in the Long 
Beach office of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. In the process 
of sending a letter to Reiten, an office worker noticed that Reiten's account 
statements were being mailed to the Huntington Beach home address of Walls, his 
Merrill Lynch broker. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Walls refused to disclose Reiten's whereabouts to 
his superiors, portraying Reiten as an eccentric, Howard Hughes-like recluse 
who had no permanent address, traveled extensively out of the country and 
contacted Walls infrequently by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch fired Walls in late 1988. Unable to find Reiten, the company went 
to Superior Court to have Reiten declared missing and to have the Orange County 
public guardian appointed conservator of Reiten's money. 
</P>
<P>
Walls insisted that the conservatorship was not necessary and that Reiten was 
not missing. He said that he had once been out of touch with Reiten for more 
than a year. He described himself as a close personal friend of Reiten and 
pointed out that it was under "the exceptional acumen" of his management that 
Reiten's Merrill Lynch account had grown from $1 million in 1969 to about $12 
million, far outperforming most accounts in the office. 
</P>
<P>
Walls failed to persuade the court. In March, 1989, the public guardian was 
appointed conservator of Reiten's estate, and Reiten was declared a missing 
person. Two months later, Reiten's money was mentioned in an ABC television 
program, "Unclaimed Fortunes." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Bayfield, one of Reiten's nephews saw the show, astounded to hear his 
reclusive uncle described as a multimillionaire. Questioned, Reiten admitted to 
his sister that he had hefty accounts at Merrill Lynch and E. F. Hutton. His 
relatives wrote to the firms, and investigators were sent to interview him. 
Reiten told them he had forgotten about his multimillion-dollar account at 
Merrill Lynch, said Teja W. Geldmacher, Orange County deputy public guardian. 
</P>
<P>
The guardian's office, wary of being liable for so rich an estate, was not 
satisfied, however, that the Reiten of Bayfield was the Reiten of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The search for more proof was frustrated by the paucity of photographs of the 
camera-shy Reiten, a transposed Social Security number in his stock records and 
the variety of first names Reiten assumed over the course of his life. Having 
never driven, he even lacked a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
The guardian's office hired a detective agency to get photographs and 
fingerprints of Reiten, but the investigator arrived in Wisconsin a week after 
Reiten's death on Aug. 28, 1989. Wigley, representing the second agency hired 
by the guardian's office, traveled to Bayfield last October. He plowed through 
roomfuls of Reiten's chaotic papers, stacked in boxes up to the ceiling, and 
found thousands of dollars in uncashed dividend checks. He returned to 
California with a handful of photos of Reiten. 
</P>
<P>
Wigley went to San Diego to show the snapshots to Fagan, the retired 
stockbroker, who finally identified Reiten to the satisfaction of the 
guardian's office. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Reiten's heirs were appointed representatives of his estate, which 
is now in probate in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Walls, 66, was indicted in February on federal fraud charges alleging that he 
diverted more than $400,000 from Reiten's accounts. He has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Walls was protecting the funds," said his attorney, Charles Wehner. "No 
funds are missing and never have been." Wehner said his client put the money he 
is accused of taking into joint accounts with Reiten because Reiten had not 
been in touch and was assumed to be out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Reiten's heirs share his penchant for privacy. A relative said they have 
revealed little about the millions they are due to inherit and that the odd 
tale of Everett Reiten's secret riches hasn't even been mentioned in the local 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the money would change the unadorned, small-town lifestyle of Reiten's 
heirs, the relative replied without pausing: "Absolutely not." Asked if they 
would spend the money, she added: "I doubt it."

FROM A CHAMBER OF HORRORS TO DEATH ROW 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
VISALIA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Harris family was especially handsome, headed by a strapping, well-spoken 
hero of World War II. And like many before them, they came to California from 
the East in search of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
But within weeks of the Harrises' arrival in this Central Valley farming town 
in 1962, authorities found that the man of the family had broken all parental 
taboos. Kenneth Harris Sr., an alcoholic, beat his children and molested his 
two oldest daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he would load his rifle, tell the children to run, then go "hunting" 
for them. The older ones struggled to hush the babies, for fear their hiding 
places would be uncovered. Harris' wife, Evelyn, an alcoholic who bore nine 
children, was too frail and battered to step in. 
</P>
<P>
It was "probably the worst (family) we ever dealt with," said Francis Beck, at 
the time a Tulare County probation officer. Although the elder Harris seemed 
proper and dignified, when he spoke "the emotional part wasn't there," recalled 
William Brazil, Beck's partner. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a century later, Beck can still picture 10-year-old Robert, the 
fifth-oldest. He was particularly "bright looking." But Beck was shocked by 
what he remembered as Robert's initial run-in with the local law: killing 
neighborhood cats. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Robert Alton Harris, a convicted killer, sits on San Quentin's Death 
Row, passing what may be the last hours of his life. The state attorney general 
is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a stay of Harris' scheduled execution 
that was granted by a federal appellate judge on Friday, thereby sending him to 
his death at 3 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Top death penalty defense lawyers are fighting to win Harris a new day in 
court. The lawyers argue that the crimes that landed Harris on Death Row may be 
the result of brain damage -- his mother is said to have abused alcohol when 
she was pregnant with him; his father beat him into unconsciousness more than 
once. Therefore, the lawyers contend, he should not be executed. 
</P>
<P>
In a case that shocked San Diego and the rest of California, Harris shot and 
killed John Mayeski and Michael Baker, both 16 and best friends, near Miramar 
Reservoir outside San Diego on the morning of July 5, 1978. He laughed about 
the murders, ate remnants of the boys' lunches, and noticed a piece of flesh 
clinging to the barrel of his gun. Commenting how he "really blew (one of the 
boy's) brains out," he "flicked the flesh out into the street." That 
recollection came from Daniel Harris, his brother and accuser, whose testimony 
at Robert's 1979 trial caused an alternate juror to faint. 
</P>
<P>
With Daniel in tow, Robert Harris had kidnaped the boys from a shopping center 
parking lot because he wanted Mayeski's car for a getaway from what a 
prosecutor called a "lousy" bank robbery. He forced them to drive to the 
reservoir, promising no harm would come to them. But as they walked away, 
shooting began. Mayeski fell first. Then Robert Harris chased Baker. The boy 
tried to hide, and pleaded for his life, Daniel Harris testified. 
</P>
<P>
"God can't help you now, boy. You're going to die," one witness quoted Robert 
Harris as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The Harris brothers were arrested minutes after the robbery. By nightfall, 
Robert had confessed to the murders. In past statements, he has said he does 
not know why he killed the boys. Raymond Cameron, a San Diego County district 
attorney's investigator on the case, says there is no mystery. A witness 
testified that Harris confided he "couldn't have no punks walking around" to 
identify him. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has refused recent interview requests. But based on interviews with his 
siblings, friends and accusers, together with a review of thousands of pages of 
court transcripts and reports, it is apparent that Harris' path to the brink of 
California's gas chamber began with life in a childhood chamber of horrors. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a park in Visalia, Barbara Mason, Harris' oldest sister and a 
twice-divorced mother of four, recalled her father and her childhood, and 
clutched herself against the sudden chills that ran up her spine. 
</P>
<P>
Her paternal grandmother was a Sunday school teacher with such Victorian 
attitudes toward sex that she would sniff his hands when he returned from the 
outhouse to make certain he had not masturbated, Barbara said, relating stories 
that he told. In his twisted mind, Barbara said, he believed he could teach his 
children not to be ashamed of their bodies if he exposed himself. 
</P>
<P>
When World War II broke out, he enlisted. He survived combat in Europe, won a 
Silver Star and a Purple Heart and spent three months recovering from a 
shrapnel wound to the chest. He attained the rank of warrant officer, and made 
the Army his career. 
</P>
<P>
By the time his wife was pregnant with their fifth child, he had become a big 
drinker. Convinced she was having an affair, he kicked her in the stomach and 
forced her into early labor. The baby, born at Ft. Bragg, N.C., stayed two 
months in an Army hospital under intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert was born in pain," Barbara said, "and lived through pain all of his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
At Robert's trial, his mother said her husband didn't acknowledge he had 
fathered Robert until the boy became a teen and began to resemble him. But all 
through his younger years, Harris suffered for his father's wrongheaded 
jealousy. There was the time that the elder Harris knocked him out of his high 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
"His nose bled so profusely that it bled clear through the pillow," Evelyn 
Harris said at Robert's trial. "Oh, lookie, Evelyn," his father was quoted as 
saying, "your baby is bleeding to death." She waited until her husband left 
before taking him to the Army infirmary. "Rather than cause trouble and all, I 
told them down there he fell out of his high chair." 
</P>
<P>
Robert was especially close to a brother 13 months his senior. Today, the 
brother, who asked that his name not be used to protect his career in another 
state, tries to understand why he straightened himself out and Robert failed. 
They were two of a kind. As children, they explored together, they got into 
trouble together, and, when they could, they comforted one another. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a kid and you see your mother slapped down by your father, you 
know it's serious," the brother said. "I remember me and Robbie, we would 
huddle up together." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, he said, Robert failed because he was "slower" than the other kids. 
"Having parents who were so authoritarian, we'd get smacked up-side the head or 
shouted at. He was slower, so he got it more than the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, the brother said, "I was just luckier." 
</P>
<P>
In the Harris family, luck was relative. Kenneth Harris Sr. retired from the 
Army on Oct. 31, 1962. Leaving $2,500 behind in debts in South Carolina, he 
headed West in a 1956 Buick with a wife six months pregnant and eight children, 
2 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 7, 1962, they pulled into Linnell Center, a cluster of cabins and 
outhouses near Visalia used primarily by farm workers and run by the Tulare 
County Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 17, 1963, two days after Robert Harris turned 10, police came for his 
father. It fell to William Brazil, a 27-year-old probation officer, to 
investigate the elder Harris. 
</P>
<P>
In stilted official language, Brazil's reports tell how Barbara, then 15, was 
detained for shoplifting. Fearing the wrath of her parents, not wanting to go 
home, she let loose with stories of sexual abuse by her father. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Rheadawn, 12, confirmed it all. She told of the day she stayed home from 
school to care for her younger brothers. Her father, she said, called her into 
his room and forced her to masturbate him. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim states that when she or her sister declined their father's advances 
he would strike them," Brazil's report said. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Harris pleaded guilty to charges filed against him. A judge declared 
him to be a mentally disordered sex offender and sent him to Atascadero state 
hospital. Given his military background, he quickly adjusted to institutional 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"It is considered," the impressed Atascadero psychologists said when they 
returned him to Visalia in June, 1964, "this man is unlikely to offend against 
society again." 
</P>
<P>
But that December, he went home one evening from the packing plant where he 
worked, began to drink whiskey and became abusive. Then, sitting at the dinner 
</P>
<P>
table, he began to choke and coughed up blood. His wife and Rheadawn helped him 
to a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Harris emerged from the bedroom and told a son to call the police. The 
officers arrived to find the elder Harris drunk, orally copulating Rheadawn. He 
was hauled away, in view of his crying children. This time, he served five 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Brazil and Beck know the children should have been placed in 
foster homes. The parents "had no business at that point in their lives rearing 
kids," said Beck, now a criminology professor at a junior college in Visalia. 
But the times and the place worked against the Harris family. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years ago in Visalia, we're talking about 14,000 people. The level of 
service was minimal at best," Beck said. "The system didn't pick up on the red 
flag. It should have." 
</P>
<P>
The family's life continued to spiral downward. They lived on welfare. Evelyn 
Harris went to bars. She took the kids on the road, and met a man who went by 
many names. They all followed the crops, sleeping in their car and a tent. 
Discipline disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"We were allowed to drink," said the older brother that Robert was close to. 
"We were allowed to do whatever we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
The brother left home when he was 14. As Robert told it in his trial, his 
mother told him to hit the road soon after, when he turned 14. He followed his 
brother to Oklahoma, where a sister, Barbara, was living. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement didn't last. The brother caught Robert sniffing paint and glue. 
When he tried to intervene, the brothers fought. Robert ran off. With two 
friends, he stole a car, made his way to Florida and was arrested. Since no 
parent was willing to take him, he remained in custody for five years. 
</P>
<P>
He left jail tough and cold. But he did learn to weld and for a time, it 
seemed, he was headed for success. He married in 1973 and had a son. But as he 
later told it, his wife left him when he "beat her up pretty bad one day." She 
could not be reached, and has not been in contact with Harris in years. Harris 
hasn't seen his son, now about 16, since the boy was a baby. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Harris' troubles turned deadly. He was living in the Imperial County 
town of Seeley, and one night was drinking with a neighbor named James Wheeler. 
Harris began slapping Wheeler in play fight. Soon, the play became sadistic. He 
doused Wheeler with lighter fluid and tossed matches at him. He sheared 
Wheeler's hair. By morning, Wheeler was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Harris pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, and served 2 1/2 years at the 
California Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo. His parole in January, 1978, was a 
failure from the start. Imperial Beach police arrested him for drunk driving 12 
days after his release. He quit a job as a welder, and moved out of a halfway 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Then he hit on the idea of robbing a bank and enlisted his brother Daniel, 
three weeks past his 18th birthday. On the morning of July 5, 1978, Harris saw 
Baker and Mayeski in the latter's car, eating lunches of hamburgers, soft 
drinks, French fries and turnovers. Pistol in hand, he told them to drive. 
</P>
<P>
After the teens had been murdered, the brothers returned to the Mira Mesa home 
of Robert Harris' girlfriend. He carried the food bag in from the car, 
evidently intending to destroy the evidence. First, he took a bite, and offered 
a lemon turnover to Daniel. Daniel threw up. "He laughed at me and said I 
didn't have the stomach to take it because I refused it," Daniel testified. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, the brothers drove a mile and a half to a San Diego Trust 
&amp; Savings Bank. Robert pulled a gun and Daniel grabbed $3,000. A man who 
watched them leave tailed them to the girlfriend's house and called the police, 
who arrived within minutes. Less than two hours after Mayeski's car had been 
stolen, the deadly escapade was over. 
</P>
<P>
As he investigated the murder in 1978, Cameron found Harris' father living in a 
trailer in Chula Vista. He wouldn't discuss his past problems. But he did have 
an explanation for Robert's actions. "He never was any good," the old man said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' trial began in January, 1979. It ended fast. On March, 14, 1979, he 
arrived on Death Row. Daniel served time for the bank robbery and was off 
parole by 1983. He is married and has three children. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Robert Harris found life on Death Row hard. Other prisoners shunned 
him. But over time, he formed relationships. Earlier this year, several 
prisoners and two guards wrote letters to the courts vouching for his 
generosity and saying he gets along with inmates and staff. 
</P>
<P>
While on Death Row, Harris made one lasting friend, writer Michael Kroll, a 
lifelong death penalty abolitionist. Kroll met Harris in 1982 as he worked on 
an article and has visited him weekly since, Thanksgiving and Christmas 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has given flesh to Kroll's view that the death penalty is barbaric. In a 
court filing, Harris said, "I love this man." Last Christmas, he knitted a 
scarf for Kroll. Kroll, in turn, has been a link to the outside, delivering to 
Harris news of court defeats and acting as his defender. 
</P>
<P>
If Harris was a cruel and "laughing killer" in 1978, "there's genuine humility 
now," Kroll said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wishes that he could undo what he did," Kroll said. "But he knows he can't. 
All the wishing in the world won't undo it." 
</P>
<P>
Though he made friends in prison, Harris never made peace with his parents. 
Evelyn Harris died of cancer in 1981. At the time, she was on probation from a 
bank robbery committed in a drunken stupor in Porterville. Police arrested her 
outside the bank. She said she wanted to get caught so she might get help for 
her drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Harris Sr., emaciated and suffering from emphysema, turned a shotgun on 
himself in April, 1989, in the San Bernardino County town of Highland. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Robert's brothers and sisters, meanwhile, are haunted both by their 
childhood memories and his crime. "I know their names," Barbara said of her 
brother's victims. "I know what they look like. In my sleep, I see them. I hear 
screams that don't exist."
